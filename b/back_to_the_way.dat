5|$|Meanwhile, Tony follows Chastity into a cave in {{the woods}} and stumbles upon a bizarre shaft of light. Once Tony steps into the light, he is possessed with the same {{abilities}} that Max and Chastity have, the ability to vibrate at high frequencies, allowing Tony to move faster than normal vision can detect. At the same time, however, Max collapses and is sent to the hospital where it is found he is suffering from exhaustion, withdrawal, a concussion, muscular tears and skeletal fractures - basically, his abilities are killing him. Mulder eventually deduces that he possesses superhuman speed. Chastity sneaks Max out of the hospital where he returns to the cave (even though she suggested they go somewhere else for help but Max refused). Later, the sheriff finds the flashlight in Max's room and confronts his son about the murders. Max confesses and then attempts to kill his father, but Tony intervenes, taking the sheriff's gun; the sheriff is promptly taken to the hospital. That night, Tony and Chastity head to the cave so that Max won't use up any more of the remaining power. Once there, Chastity has been knocked unconscious by Max, who then confronts Tony, using his abilities to take back the gun before throwing it away. However, Chastity (having come to and using her abilities) takes the gun and shoots Max from behind, then allows herself to be shot by the same bullet; she tells Tony that she can't go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> things were before. Afterwards, Tony is seen in the hospital recuperating while numerous geological experts examined the cave, but were unable to identify anything unusual. The city then fills the cave with concrete, sealing it forever, leaving the question as to what caused the teenager-related ability a mystery.|$|E

500|$|The {{screenplay}} did not {{yet have}} a satisfactory ending, and, despite the producers and studio executives worried about starting filming without a set conclusion, Liman opted to finish the script during principal photography. McQuarrie at one point suggested adding a twist involving the Mimics figuring out Cage's attack on Paris and resetting time during his strike, but discarded it as [...] "you were so exhausted by the time you got to that point." [...] Eventually, McQuarrie considered that focusing on the comedic aspects meant [...] "it needed to end in a way that wasn't harsh", and thus opted to end the plot where it started, on the helicopter bringing Cage to London, fulfilling the notion that [...] "comedies generally have to go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> things were".|$|E

I wanted to start off just at the lowest point in society, a very beaten down secretary." [...] Harvey Dent appeared in early drafts of the script, but was deleted. His disfiguring appearance of Two-Face would {{have appeared in the}} climax when Catwoman kisses him with a taser to the face, which was replaced with Max Shreck. Waters quoted, [...] "Sam Hamm definitely planned that. I flirted with it, having Harvey start to come back and have one scene of him where he flips a coin and it's the good side of the coin, deciding not to do anything, so you had to wait for the next movie." [...] In early scripts Max Shreck was the [...] "golden boy" [...] of the Cobblepot family, whereas Penguin was the deformed outsider. It turned out that Shreck would be the Penguin's long-lost brother. Max Shreck was also a reference to actor Max Schreck, known for his role as Count Orlok in Nosferatu.|$|E

500|$|The Griffins' {{business}} has a shaky start and loses money until Joe promises {{to bring his}} friends to the restaurant. Peter is at first excited {{at the thought of}} his restaurant becoming the hangout for police officers, but eventually finds that Joe is actually bringing in fellow paraplegics. The restaurant becomes a huge success among handicapped customers, but Peter is disappointed that {{what was supposed to be}} a cool restaurant has become a [...] "cafeteria at the veterans hospital," [...] and did not want to take the profits for granted. Angered, Peter bans them from entering with a [...] "no shirt, no shoes, no legs, no service" [...] policy. Joe is perplexed why Peter would turn away loyal paying customers, much less a good friend like Joe, but Peter stubbornly refuses to allow handicapped customers. In response, the handicapped unite into a giant robot known as [...] "CrippleTron", which begins attacking the restaurant while Peter, Chris and Stewie are on the roof. Stewie eventually takes matters into his own hands and defeats CrippleTron, which falls on Peter, breaking one of his legs. After being taken to the hospital, Peter needs to use a wheelchair for two weeks while his broken leg heals. Peter apologizes to Joe, who accepts his apology on the basis that he is glad to see Peter understand the difficulties of being disabled and that he does not want to continue holding a grudge against Peter. The two make amends, and things go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they were and Peter closes down the restaurant.|$|E
500|$|Returning home, Brian informs Lois that Limbaugh will {{be coming}} over for dinner. That night, Lois and Peter begin arguing and {{challenging}} Limbaugh politically. Deciding to confront Limbaugh for brainwashing Brian, Lois demands for their dog to go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he used to be. Limbaugh insists Brian became a conservative on his own terms, and the two sing a number based on [...] "The Company Way", [...] "Republican Town". Angered, Brian decides to move out and become roommates with a reluctant Limbaugh. Brian begins to irritate Limbaugh with his blind devotion. He replaces lots of Limbaugh's possessions with American-Made versions, which all go wrong. Deciding to follow Limbaugh to his radio show, Brian attempts to voice his own political opinions on the air about Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, causing Limbaugh to become frustrated and throw him out. Deciding to prove his devotion to the conservative cause, Brian attempts to waterboard Pelosi before being apprehended and arrested. After being bailed out by Limbaugh later that day, Brian continues to assert his conservatism. Limbaugh attempts to convince Brian he is only fighting against the Establishment due to his desire of being the underdog. He tells Brian that a child was executed in Texas and Brian is visibly horrified; Limbaugh then says that he made up the story, but Brian's honest reaction to it shows he is a liberal at heart. Reassuring Brian of his liberal convictions, Rush leaves the jail, making a Grapes of Wrath-like pledge to [...] "be around" [...] wherever conservative causes need help. Outside, they heckle each other with reassurance, and the episode ends with Limbaugh then transforming into a bald eagle and flying away into the skyline.|$|E

When Finn wishes for an alternate reality [...] in which the Lich never existed during {{the events of the}} fifth season premiere [...] "Finn the Human", a universe is created in which the Mushroom War was prevented by Simon Petrikov and Marceline never became a vampire.

Jake manages to undo this reality with his wish and sets everything <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it was.

After the events of [...] "Sky Witch", Bubblegum and Marceline are on much friendlier ground, and their friendship is completely reaffirmed in the episodes [...] "Varmints" [...] and [...] "Broke His Crown", from the seventh and eighth season respectively. In [...] "Betty", Marceline sacrifices Hambo so that Ice King—who lost his powers and became Simon Petrikov again—can open a portal into time so that Simon can reconcile with his estranged fiancee Betty. Although the two are reunited in [...] "Betty", due to the rush of events, Marceline and Simon are unable to fully catch up before Simon reverts back to the Ice King.

500|$|When Shannon is eight, {{her father}} marries Sabrina Carlyle (Lindsay Frost), and she {{spends much of}} her {{adolescence}} with her stepbrother Boone. She studies ballet and, as she gets older, teaches dance classes to young girls. When she is eighteen, Shannon's father dies in a car crash. He {{did not have a}} will prepared, so all of his money and property goes to his wife. Sabrina refuses to help Shannon financially, despite Shannon winning a prestigious yet non-paying internship to the Martha Graham Dance Company in New York. Unable {{to come up with the}} money herself, Shannon moves to France for a short time to work as an au pair. Shannon later forms a plan to con her stepbrother, Boone Carlyle, into giving her some of the inheritance she rightly deserved. Playing on her knowledge of Boone's love for her, she makes it appear her boyfriend Brian abuses her. Boone pays Brian to leave her, and Shannon plans to secretly take half the money. During one con in Sydney, her [...] "abusive boyfriend" [...] ruins Shannon's ruse after Boone cuts him a check. Boone storms off to his hotel room and plans to return to the States. When Shannon's boyfriend takes off with all of the money, Shannon goes to Boone's hotel room in Sydney, drunk, and Boone allows her to seduce him. After they have sex, Shannon tells Boone things will go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they had been before. He expresses anger because, as always, they both know she is in control of their situation/ relationship. The following morning at the Sydney airport, Sayid Jarrah approaches Shannon, asking her to watch his bag for him. She deftly obliges, but soon leaves it unattended. Before the doomed Flight 815 takes off, Shannon rummages through her hand-luggage for her asthma inhaler, which Boone casually hands to her. She smiles, the platonic love she has for Boone briefly relieving her of her misery. Six hours into the flight, only moments before the crash, Shannon and Boone are momentarily seen as Charlie Pace stumbles through their row.|$|E
