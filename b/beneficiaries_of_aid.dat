40|$|After some 65 {{years of}} {{international}} development assistance, {{it is still}} difficult to show the effectiveness of aid {{in ways that are}} fully convincing. In part, this reflects inadequacies in the evaluation systems of the bilateral, multilateral, and global organizations that provide official development aid. Underlying these weaknesses often are a lack of adequate resources to carry out evaluation, insufficient harmonization of evaluation systems to allow aggregation and comparisons, and data limitations. Capacity constraints in both developing countries and aid organizations hinder the quality of evaluations. In addition, evaluation too frequently is not used by donor agencies or recipient countries to improve development effectiveness. All of these issues raise ethical concerns about the efficient use of donor resources, the opportunity costs for developing countries, and most important the effects on the intended <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid...</b>|$|E

30|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War in 1991, an {{apparently}} more peaceful international environment quickly gave way to a surge in particularly destructive conflicts in places such as Liberia, Sudan and the former Yugoslavia, characterised by substantial loss of civilian life, massive displacement of populations and decimation of social and economic structures (Duffield 1994). While the humanitarian sector rushed to adapt logistically to the large-scale, multi-pronged responses now required (Davey et al. 2013), voices within the sector began to consider the possible impact on the people delivering the assistance. In a seminal conference paper (1995), Hugo Slim set out what he felt were the new skills for aid workers that these “radically different” (p. 2) emergencies would require, including negotiation and conflict analysis. Although Slim only made brief mention of the emotional needs of aid workers, his paper was representative of a new interest in the lives of humanitarians themselves, alongside those of the <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess {{possible}} reforms for the future financial framework of the Community Budget for the period 2007 - 2013, attaching special importance to their impacts on the Spanish economy. We analyze the fiscal balances of each of the Fifteen with the Union budget and reveal the existence of problems of horizontal equity in the contributions of the Fifteen to the Community budget. We also show that, as opposed to what is usually affirmed, Spain is not the country that has most benefited from the Structural Measures policy. After simulating the costs that would be entailed in enlargement, including the “statistical effect”, we defend the advisability of introducing corrective mechanism that may enable the regions of the present members that would continue to be <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> to Objective 1 regions, if there were no enlargement, to go on receiving it. Furthermore, our study upholds a more ambitious proposal: to undertake a reduction in the Community budget funds allocated to direct CAP aid in order to release funds both for the regional policy and for other Community policies. ...|$|E

The main results are commented: characterization of the spatial heterogeneity of OF, relationship between OF and markets access, territories characteristics (agronomic, socioeconomic, institutional) that increase or decrease their propensity to host organic farms.

40|$|Linking Relief, Rehabilitation and Development (LRRD) is {{a concept}} {{based on the idea}} that when relief and {{development}} are linked, deficiencies between the phases can be overcome. Better 'development' can reduce the need for emergency relief; better 'relief' can contribute to development; and better 'rehabilitation' can ease the transition between the two. The thesis uses this concept as a theoretical framework in order to look at post-tsunami Aceh as a case study and therefore deals with the question which possibilities and struggles aid agencies faced for LRRD implementation in post-tsunami Aceh. A closer look is given into the influence of donors, aid agencies, <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> and cooperating partners on the organizations’ ability to implement LRRD in Aceh. It becomes clear that even though there are many benefits for an effective linkage it was rather difficult for relief, rehabilitation and development organizations to implement LRRD in post tsunami Aceh within the given structures of aid. These difficulties ranged from general and conceptual matters to situation specific barriers for LRRD implementation. An effective linkage is possible and could to a certain extent be found in post-tsunami Aceh. However a strong incentive of aid agencies to address the linkage issue is necessary for LRRD to take place showing that even in a situation as Aceh, where resources where largely available, LRRD implementation remains a very difficult task. ...|$|E

The German {{public law}} {{financial}} institutions {{benefit from an}} enhanced credit standing {{as a consequence of}} institutional and guarantee liability (Anstaltslast and Gewährträgerhaftung) hence are the <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b> The aid granted enables these institutions to fulfill their public duties but also enhances their competitive position, hence represents State Aid according to the EC-Treaty. The application of the State Aid principles of the EC-Treaty are compatible with the tasks assigned to the German public law financial institutions: Whilst property ownership rules must not be affected by the EC-Treaty, Member Sates must not act in a way that contravenes the Treaty provisions. The market economy investor principle does not allow a Member State to grant aid as long as the supported institution remains in an economically viable position. The degree of aid granted can be masured by the enhanced credit rating. The value of unlimited aid is not comparable to civil law concepts such as guarantees, letters of comfort, profit sharing agreements or investor compensation schemes. Institutional and guarantee liability distorts competition. The Commission should therefore order Germany to abolish or alter the aid granted.

40|$|This paper gives a broad {{overview}} of the evolution <b>of</b> Belgian <b>aid</b> policies throughout the 1990 s.

Chivi is a district which has been plagued with chronic poverty for a long while now thus it has attracted the attention of external philanthropists as well as local government authorities in trying to end poverty. Making use of various theories, the research inferred how communication helps shape the perceptions of the poor towards eradication of poverty in the district. The researcher used ethnography as well as questionnaires as the key methods for establishing the objective of the research. The research established {{that the majority of the}} <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> favoured the NGOs poverty eradication efforts as compared to the state. However, a uniform contradictory opinion emerged from a minor population with apparently better literacy levels. Interpersonal communication, particularly with the NGO officials played a key role in shaping this opinion. Recommendations were made to both the state and NGOs on how best to address the issue of poverty in Chivi District. To the NGOs, it was basically recommended that they implement self-sustainability development aid projects, with eventual plans to withdraw operations from the district. To the state, recommendations were made to invest in long term, permanent development projects which could effectively solve the problem of poverty in the district. It was further suggested, however, that further research may be necessary on a broader level for the sake of generalising results to a larger population...|$|E
40|$|Responsibility for the {{contents}} and presentation of findings and recommendations rest with the evaluation team. The views and opinions {{expressed in the}} report do not necessarily correspond with those of Norad”. Preface Is there too little independent research about Norwegian development assistance, {{in a way that}} limits information and an informed debate about the results of aid? The question is relevant, if only for the sheer size of aid. Official Norwegian development cooperation amounts to 27 billion kroner or approximately 5 billion US dollars per year. The question is also relevant because the voice of the intended <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> is often weak and far away. Most would agree that the results of such a big investment should be monitored closely. This is actually the purpose of evaluation. But as evaluators, we know its limits. Evaluation can give useful information about the effects of aid and recommendations about how to improve it. But independent research can go further. It can ask its own questions, dig deeper {{over a longer period of}} time, and give more information about the aid world and the world without aid. There is hardly a clear-cut answer to the question above. The present evaluation was commissioned to assess it by collecting and analysing information about research on development cooperation. Specifically, we wanted to know more about the amount, composition, and independence of research on Norwegian development assistance, with a view to recommend ways to strengthen independent research.

40|$|The {{humanitarian}} {{sector is}} in need to prioritize its human resources. Inadequate recruitment processes, aid workers that enter the field unprepared, failed interrelationships and team dissatisfaction leads to poorer work quality, poorer health, and a high employee turnover that are costly for the field, and negative {{on the side of}} accountability to the <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b> In order to address these problems the study is investigating the use of a personality type system tool developed by the researcher, the 4 mpt-system (4 major personality types-system),that tentatively is constructed as a tool to be applied within human resources in the humanitarian sector to access individual preferences and character traits that would facilitate in addressing the issues mentioned above. The data is gathered via in-depth semi-structured interviews of 7 informants working in the international humanitarian sector. The first objective is to study {{the reliability and validity of}} the 4 mpt-system. The second objective is to study what information that could be accessed via the 4 mpt-system tool from the 7 informants participating in the study. The result of the study would demonstrate that all of the informants could be assigned to a specific temperament type via a qualitative data analyze method designed from the 4 mpt-system and that the temperaments affected the informants to a large extent (from motivations and skills to organisational preferences and personal belief systems). Further, the answers of the informants matched the theoretical definitions of the traits assigned to the temperament types by Keirsey (1998) and Fisher (2009), which was a positive indication for a good validity of the 4 mpt-system. By verifying the similarity between the answers of informants assigned to the same temperament type, validity was further confirmed. The results of the study supported the reliability and validity of the 4 mpt -system. The type of information that could be accessed via the 4 mpt-system in the study was among other the motivation for beginning in the humanitarian field, work task preferences, professional skills, problem-solving approaches, decision making processes, likes and dislikes with work and work tasks, organisational structure preference, preference for working directly in the field or working from the office, and general outlooks and personal belief systems...|$|E

Rajaratnam School of International Studies (previously European University Institute), Supervisor Professor Ulrich Krotz, European University Institute Professor Stephan Klingebiel, German Development Institute Professor Ann Fitz-Gerald, Cranfield University. In recent years, {{international}} donors have steadily {{increased their}} focus on fragile states, defined by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as “those failing to provide basic services to poor people because they are {{unwilling or unable to}} do so”. An indication of this shift {{is the nature of the}} policies promoted by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD, which encourages bilateral donors that work with fragile states to adopt a whole-of-government approach, i. e. to develop cross-departmental cooperation between defence, diplomacy and development administrations. The question as to why some bilateral donors implement such integrated approaches to confront challenges in fragile states, while others only do so marginally or not at all still remains. Neither the existing literatures on security or development cultures nor the current securitization theories are able to explain the different levels and patterns of implementation of these specific OECD/DAC recommendations. In this thesis, I use the concept of “the organization of hypocrisy” to understand the complex relationship, and often the discrepancy, that exists between “talk” and “action” in the policy attempts to link security and development. Donor organizations are routinely confronted with the security and development demands of various actors. They need to act to produce results, and include such activities as contributing to UN peacekeeping missions to increase the country in question’s chances for development, or deciding who should be the <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> without fostering conflict. Producing these desired outcomes is not always possible however. Consequently, donor organizations “talk” about coherence, but are unable to “act” coherently and therefore to adapt their strategies and their policies. I compare France, Germany, the UK and the EU as donors – in particular in their roles in North and South Sudan, but also in selected West African countries – in an attempt to understand which factors favour a higher level of “action” with regard to the security-development nexus. I argue that bureaucracies cannot be studied in isolation from their complex and often inconsistent environment. The ability of the diplomacy, defence and development sectors to integrate their administrations and policies depends on the consistency of their environment and on their institutional ability to collectively find an acceptable convention that is capable of balancing development, diplomacy and defence norms. Protecting the normative aims of development policy is the key to achieving a higher level of integration in some OECD/DAC donor countries as well as to cultivating the formation of synergies between security and development policies...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{international}} assistance, the aid paradigm has changed continually and the choice of mechanisms for providing assistance has evolved {{in order to try}} and pursue better approaches. Along with the traditional project approach, the sector-wide approach involving budgetary support has emerged as a new aid modality since the mid- 1990 s. While many donors – e. g. the UK Department for International Development (DFID), the World Bank and the European Union (EU) – have embraced the new modality, some donors have kept their distance from this trend, relying mostly on project assistance – e. g. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). However, the extent to which aid resources are absorbed in the recipient government/sector under the different aid delivery mechanisms is not well known. This thesis provides insight into this question by exploring the process of absorbing foreign funds in the education sector. Employing a phenomenological research approach, the process is examined {{from the point of view}} of local actors and <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> aimed at improving education quality. The context chosen is basic education (primary and junior secondary) in Ghana after the introduction of the national basic education reform, which was announced as the Free Compulsory Universal Basic Education (FCUBE) programme in 1996. Two cases are chosen for comparison: the Whole School Development (WSD) programme financed by the DFID; and the Quality Improvements in Primary Schools (QUIPS) programme facilitated by USAID. The former constitutes a sector-wide type of assistance, which put Ghanaian officials in charge of DFID funds and the implementation of the programme; while the latter adopted a project type model, with implementation managed directly through a USAIDfunded project office. The major part of the data is derived from interviews conducted in 2006 with significant educational personnel at three different levels: Ministry of Education (MoE) headquarters, the District Education Office (DEO), and the schools). The analysis reveals a complex picture of aid absorption, which illuminates the pros and cons of the two approaches in relation to impact and sustainability. The study finds that the QUIPS project achieved tangible results in the pilot schools, while the WSD programme made little impact at the school level. The WSD programme, which used existing structures within the education system to deliver funds and resources to schools, showed evidence of high fungibility, but appears to have strengthened the Ministry‟s administrative capacity. On the other hand, the QUIPS approach, which had low fungibility, has been severely criticised by Ghanaian officials, who questioned its sustainability and contribution to system-wide change. The thesis concludes by stating its specific contribution to the literature on international aid assistance to developing countries and making recommendations for the Ghanaian context...|$|E

The Partisans deliberately provoked retaliation by killing German soldiers in outlying posts.

Humanitarian intervention has evolved to become as complex as the conflict itself. Humanitarian agencies are increasing in number and diversification, expanding their capacity to address emergency situations. As a consequence, the repercussions of assistance have also increased and the exploitation <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> by warring parties {{and the creation of}} dependency have become central concerns. The commitment of political institutions is important for the success of humanitarian intervention yet it often remains in doubt. Unwillingness {{to be involved in the}} problems of another state or region has minimal appeal where no national security issues are at stake. The tendency to misinterpret or obfuscate the causes and processes of conflict has compromised the capability of political actors to address the conflict and its consequences. The conflicts in Rwanda, Bosnia and the Solomon Islands illustrated the multifarious problems associated with humanitarian assistance and the subsequent consequences. It is suggested the capability of humanitarian intervention in the future relies on its re-evaluation in an effort to deal with the specific aspects of the given conflict and minimise the inappropriate allocation <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b> Furthermore, reform <b>of</b> the processes of development in conflict and post-conflict situations is required in an effort to bolster the resilience of recipient populations to the processes conducive to conflict. The support and commitment from political actors also remains critical for the success of humanitarian intervention. The need for early assessment and pre-emptive or reconciliatory diplomacy are key objectives yet must be backed by military capabilities necessary for the protection of the providers and the <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> relief <b>aid...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Middlecoat's prowess as a {{pilot and}} leader were {{recognized}} {{early in his career}} and when Pakistan became the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> US military <b>aid</b> in the 1950s, he was selected, along with his close friend, Allauadin [...] "Butch" [...] Ahmed, to be the first two PAF officers to go to the US to train on the F-86 Sabre. This was a huge honor for a Christian officer. Some years later, the same two officers were again selected as PAF pioneers to go to the US to train on the more advanced F-104 Starfighter.The F-104 was inducted in the PAF's No. 9 Squadron (known as Griffins, which is the first fighter squadron of the PAF) and went on to be the [...] "bogeyman" [...] aircraft of Indian Air Force piots during the September 1965 war.

40|$|Coalition {{formation}} {{has been}} documented in a diverse array of taxa, yet {{there has been little}} formal analysis of polyadic interactions such as coalitions. Here, we develop an optimality model which examines the role of winner and loser effects in shaping coalition formation. We demonstrate that the predicted patterns of alliances are strongly dependent on the way in which winner and loser effects change with contestant strength. When winner and loser effects decrease with the resource-holding power (RHP) of the combatants, coalitions will be favoured between the strongest members of a group, but not between the weakest. If, in contrast, winner and loser effects increase with RHP, exactly the opposite predictions emerge. All other things being equal, intervention is more likely to prove worthwhile when the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> the <b>aid</b> is weaker (and its opponent is stronger), because the beneficiary is then less likely to win without help. Consequently, intervention is more probable when the impact of victory on the subsequent performance of a combatant increases with that individual's strength because this selects for intervention in favour of weaker combatants. The published literature on hierarchy formation does not reveal how winner and loser effects actually change with contestant strength and we therefore hope that our model will spur others to collect such data; in this light we suggest an experiment which will help to elucidate the nature of winner and loser effects and their impact on coalition formation in animals...|$|R
