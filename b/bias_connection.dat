The photodiode {{is connected to}} a part <b>bias</b> <b>connection</b> (9) for the supply with a blocking voltage. A <b>bias</b> <b>connection</b> (11) {{is connected to the}} resistor for controlling the potential at the signal output. The capacitor is provided for the high-frequency-technological earthing of the resistor. The capacitor lies between the <b>bias</b> <b>connection</b> and an earth line.

40|$|Voltage-sensitive dye imaging {{experiments}} in {{primary visual cortex}} (V 1) have shown that local, oriented visual stimuli elicit stable orientation-selective activation within the stimulus retinotopic footprint. The cortical activation dynamically extends far beyond the retinotopic footprint, but the peripheral spread stays non-selective-a surprising finding given a number of anatomo-functional studies showing the orientation specificity of long-range connections. Here we use a computational model to investigate this apparent discrepancy by studying the expected population response using known published anatomical constraints. The dynamics of input-driven localized states were simulated in a planar neural field model with multiple sub-populations encoding orientation. The realistic connectivity profile has parameters controlling the clustering of long-range connections and their orientation bias. We found substantial overlap between the anatomically relevant parameter range and a steep decay in orientation selective activation {{that is consistent with}} the imaging experiments. In this way our study reconciles the reported orientation <b>bias</b> of long-range <b>connections</b> with the functional expression of orientation selective neural activity. Our results demonstrate this sharp decay is contingent on three factors, that long-range connections are sufficiently diffuse, that the orientation <b>bias</b> of these <b>connections</b> is in an intermediate range (consistent with anatomy) and that excitation is sufficiently balanced by inhibition. Conversely, our modelling results predict that, for reduced inhibition strength, spurious orientation selective activation could be generated through long-range lateral connections. Furthermore, if the orientation <b>bias</b> of lateral <b>connections</b> is very strong, or if inhibition is particularly weak, the network operates close to an instability leading to unbounded cortical activation...|$|R

They explore social connections among mobile users {{in a variety of}} novel scenarios, including friend finding, message routing, and content sharing. However, efficiently supporting resource-demanding delay-sensitive streaming applications on the mobile platform remains a significant challenge. Research on such topics will naturally widen the usage of mobile social applications. The solutions to the challenges will provide suggestion on many related work. It is interesting and valuable to explore the system performance and users’ experience in such scenarios. Furthermore, users’ concern about social network is also significant to develop a mobile social network application. It is important to detect users’ strategies to communicate with others. That influences the network topologies and provides <b>biased</b> <b>connections.</b> The strategy consists of various of aspects, most of which are the user preference and user social attributes. Focusing on this meaningful research field, we study collaborative VoD-type streaming of short videos among small groups of mobile users, so as to effectively exploit their social relationships. Such an application can be practically set in a number of usage scenarios, including streaming of introductory video clips of exhibition items to visitors’ mobile devices, such as in a museum. We analyze users’ behavior strategies based on their social preference and social attributes. We design SMS, an architecture that engineers such Streaming over Mobile Social networks. SMS constructs a collaborative streaming overlay by carefully inspecting social connections among users and infrastructure characteristics of Bluetooth technologies. To improve the performance, we analyze the scatternet structure of Bluetooth technology and propose appropriate scatternet structure in our system. We evaluate our design based on prototype implementation on the Android platform, as well as on a large emulation testbed.

We first examined whether a change to that algorithm, as proposed by Floyd, that results in a "Constant-Rate" additive increase policy can correct the <b>bias</b> against <b>connections</b> with long round trip times (RTTs). Our first main result is that although the Constant-Rate policy can improve fairness dramatically, we {{found it difficult to}} successfully implement such a policy in a heterogeneous network. Next, we explored whether TCP connections with long RTTs could independently improve their own throughputs by becoming slightly more aggressive during the additive increase phase of congestion avoidance. Our second main result is that the judicious use of such a policy is beneficial for long RTT connections, without significantly affecting the performance of peer connections along the same path, thereby improving our metric of network fairness without compromising the utilization [...] ...|$|R

40|$|GREEN is a {{proactive}} queue-management (PQM) algorithm that removes TCP's <b>bias</b> against <b>connections</b> with longer round-trip times, while maintaining high link utilization and low packet-loss. GREEN applies {{knowledge of the}} steady-state behavior of TCP connections to proactively drop packets, thus preventing congestion from ever occurring. As a result, GREEN ensures much higher fairness between flows than other active queue management schemes like Flow Random Early Drop (FRED) and Stochastic Fair Blue (SFB), which suffer in topologies where {{a large number of}} flows have widely varying round-trip times. GREEN'S performance relies on its ability to gauge a flow's round-trip time (RTT). In previous work, we presented results for an ideal GREEN router which has accurate RTT information for a flow.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{modification}} of the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [1] to correct the <b>bias</b> against <b>connections</b> with long round trip times (RTT) of TCP. The New-ECN algorithm achieves a fair sharing of the available bandwidth of a bottleneck gateway. The idea is to prevent a fast connection from opening its congestion window too quickly and to enable a slow connection to open its window more aggressively. This is done by modifying not only the congestion window size but also by modifying its rate of increase. Both are reduced while receiving marked packets and are increased during times of no congestion. We demonstrate the effect and performance of the New-ECN algorithm with the network simulator "ns" [4] for different network topologies. Additionally, we study the TCP and ECN-TCP friendliness of the New-ECN algorithm. In this paper we only focus on the single bottleneck case. The behavior of New-ECN with multiple congested gateways needs further research...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} an {{international}} trend to strengthen independence requirements for auditors. Whether the new rules can be explained from an economic viewpoint is discussed {{in the first part}} of the paper. Thereby the conclusion is reached that because of reputation effects, big audit companies have strong incentives not to give up their independence. It is argued that the need for further regulations is therefore not explainable assuming rational behavior. In the second part of the paper the analysis is broadened to include systematic deviations from rationality as it is more and more done in the research area of behavioral economics. The existence and the implication of incentives identified by economic analyses are questioned. Finally the assumption of a perfect audit technology, which is often implicitly used in economic models of auditor independence, is also critically questioned. Potential negative implications of the self-serving <b>bias</b> in <b>connection</b> with accountability are shown by drawing from the results of experimental research. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a congestion control method for TCP that adjusts the transmission rate of a TCP connection by changing {{not only the}} congestion window size as in normal TCP, but also by delaying the transmission of packets at the sender. We refer to this mechanism as TCP with sender-based delay control, or simply SDC. SDC can keep the window size of a TCP connection above a certain threshold even when {{its fair share of}} bandwidth is arbitrarily small. Since TCP fast retransmit and recovery is likely to work when the window size of the connection is sufficiently large, the new scheme can result in reduced frequency of TCP timeouts for the connection. In particular, SDC allows many TCP flows to share a link without experiencing many timeouts. In addition, SDC reduces a wellknown TCP <b>bias</b> against <b>connections</b> with large RTTs. The paper presents the principle behind SDC, and simulation results demonstrating its properties and advantages. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The zero {{crossing}} steps of Fig. 1b allow a single bias current {{passing through the}} entire junction array while insuring that every junction in the array is on a constant voltage step. This leads to significant complication in setting the array to a particular desired step. Figure 9a illustrates a simplified diagram of the bias circuit. In this circuit a computer sets the bias voltage [...] with one digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and uses a second DAC to control the bias impedance [...] via optically modulated resistors. Figure 9b shows a graphical solution for the stable operating points of the array and illustrates how control of both the bias voltage and the bias impedance is used to select a particular quantum voltage step.The load line plots the range of voltage and current that are defined by the bias supply. The intersections of this load line with the I-V curve of the array (vertical lines) are possible stable bias points. Changes to [...] shift the load line left and right, whereas changes to [...] change its slope. To select a step at a given voltage , the source voltage is set to [...] and the source impedance is set to about , where [...] is the step height. This makes the load line steep enough to intersect {{only one or two}} steps and forces the array to a step at or very near [...] Applying a damped oscillation to [...] helps move the array to the step closest to [...] After a step is selected, the source impedance is smoothly increased on all four <b>bias</b> <b>connections</b> (load line becomes horizontal) until the array current goes to zero and the array is effectively disconnected from the bias source. This open-bias condition is the most stable state for the array and eliminates the possibility of any errors resulting from a small series resistance in the array - a common array defect. Computer control of this three-step process enables the system to find and stabilize the array voltage on a particular step within a few seconds. High quality Josephson arrays will remain on a selected step for many hours.|$|R

When making a choice between an interesting job that pays $60,000 {{a year and a}} boring job that pays $70,000 a year or a choice between two equally priced houses, one of them larger but farther from work, the average individual is likely to make false assumptions - for example, that $70,000 will make them feel exactly one-sixth better than $60,000, or that 4,000 square-foot house is one-third better than a 3,000 square-foot house. In reality, on average, we don't actually feel one-sixth better having the extra money or one-third better having the extra space. The more sensible approach, the writer advises in accordance with the research of Hsee and Zhang, is to avoid comparing two jobs, or houses, directly. Instead, consider each job, or house, individually and make an overall assessment of each one on its own, and then compare assessments, which allows them to make a choice that accurately predicts future experience.|$|R
40|$|GREEN is a {{stateless}} queue-management algorithm that removes TCP's <b>bias</b> against <b>connections</b> {{with longer}} round-trip times, {{resulting in a}} high degree of fairness while maintaining high link utilization, low packet loss, and short queue sizes. GREEN applies the knowledge of the steady-state behavior of TCP connections to drop packets proactively, thus preventing long-lived TCP flows from ever inducing congestion. It also prevents shorter round-trip time (RTT) flows from grabbing more than their fair share of bandwidth. Consequently, GREEN ensures much higher fairness between flows than other queue-management schemes. Initial work on GREEN evaluated the performance of an ideal GREEN router, which was assumed to have global knowledge of each individual flow's RTT. Furthermore, the algorithm was susceptible to severe under-utilization of the link bandwidth in the presence of short-lived or low-bandwidth flows. To address these shortcomings, we present an incentive-based solution where flows benefit by embedding their current RTT estimates in the TCP header. We then present results for an IDMaps-based solution where the router estimates a flow's RTT by performing lookups in a local IDMaps database. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm is resilient for both long-lived as well as short-lived and low-bandwidth connections...|$|R
40|$|Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is {{the most}} widely used {{transport}} protocol for reliable data transfer in the Internet. TCP uses packet drop as an indication of network congestion. Unnecessary packet drops lead to poor performance. This problem also exists when TCP traffic is in a Differentiated Services (DiffServ) enabled network. Moreover, the DiffServ network inherits the problem of TCP that <b>biases</b> against <b>connections</b> with long round trip time (RTT) and leads to unfairness among the connections with different RTTs. Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is proposed as a mechanism to avoid packet losses and thus improve the link efficiency. In this thesis, variation of ECN with a new marking strategy called mark-random is proposed to provide better fairness among the connections. Simulation results show that mark-random strategy performs the best in fairness performance compared with the other strategies. Further experiments show that a cooperation problem exists between the ECN mechanism with different marking strategies and DiffServ network. Two additional schemes, called "OUT Marking Scheme" and "Throughput Sustaining Scheme", are proposed to solve the cooperation problem. Experimental results show a great improvement by applying mark-random strategy with "OUT Marking Scheme" in a DiffServ network under different scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{describe}} a newly-developed {{artificial neural network}} algorithm for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) which includes a learning component that can significantly improve {{the performance of the}} network from run to run. The network, referred to as the Guarded Discrete Stochastic (GDS) network, is based on the discrete Hopfield network but differs from it primarily in that auxiliary networks (guards) are asymmetrically coupled to the main network to enforce certain types of constraints. Although the presence of asymmetric connections implies that the network may not converge, it was found that, for certain classes of problems, the network often quickly converges to find satisfactory solutions when they exist. The network can run efficiently on serial machines and can find solutions to very large problems (e. g., N-queens for N as large as 1024). One advantage of the network architecture is that network connection strengths need not be instantiated when the network is established: they are needed only when a participating neural element transitions from off to on. They have exploited this feature to devise a learning algorithm, based on consistency techniques for discrete CSPs, that updates the network <b>biases</b> and <b>connection</b> strengths and thus improves the network performance...|$|R

Bramoullé et al. (2012) illustrate this by conducting a study on the citation network of physics journals from the American Physical Society (APS) between 1985 and 2003. The two stages of the network development process of new nodes in this context is the random but potentially type biased finding of an article or reference by authors, and the discovery of references through citations in popular articles. Because similar articles are likely to cite similar references bias may arise in the formation of connections. Convergence is explained by three models of integration: weak integration, long-run integration, and partial integration.|$|R

However, naïvely <b>biasing</b> against longer <b>connections</b> can lead to poor network utilization, because a significantly high fraction of total connections are long in large networks with spatially uniform traffic. While proportional fair allocation provides a significant improvement, we show here that there is a much richer space of resource allocation strategies for introducing a controlled bias against resource-intensive long connections in order to significantly improve the performance of shorter connections. Specifically, mixing strongly biased allocations with fairer allocations leads to efficient network utilization as well as a superior tradeoff between flow throughput and fairness. We present an analytical model that offers insight into the impact of a particular resource allocation strategy on network performance, taking into account finite network size and spatial traffic patterns. We point to protocol design options to implement our resource allocation strategies by invoking the connection with the well-studied network utility maximization framework. Our simulation evaluation serves to verify the analytical design prescriptions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A fundamenral {{observation}} in the neurosciences {{is that the}} brain is a modular system in which different regions perform different tasks. Recent evidence, however, {{raises questions about the}} accuracy of this characterization with respect to neonates. One possible interpretation of this evidence is that certain aspects of the modular organization of the adult brain arise developmenrally. To explore this hypothesis we wish to characterize the computational principles that underlie the development of modular systems. In previous work we have considered computational schemes that allow a learning system to discover the modular structure that is present in the environment (Jacobs, Jordan, & Barto, 1991). In the current paper we present a complementary approach in which the development of modularity is due to an architectural bias in the learner. In particular, we examine the computational consequences of a simple architectural <b>bias</b> toward short-range <b>connections.</b> We present simulations that show that systems that learn under the influence of such a bias have a number of desirable properties including a tendency to decompose tasks into subtasks, to decouple the dynamics of recurrent subsystems, and to develop location-sensitive internal representations. Furthermore, the system s units develop local receptive and projective fields, and the system develops characteristics that are typically associated with topographic maps...|$|R
