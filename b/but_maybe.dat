Ashley tells Mary Margaret that all she wants is to be with Sean. Mary Margaret understands since her own romantic arrangement is not ideal. Sean shows up on a break from work and proposes to Ashley; she accepts and they {{go out for a}} drive. David shows up next to give Mary Margret her Valentine, but mistakenly gives her Kathryn's. Mary Margaret says she thought if two people were meant to be together they would find a way, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> she and David need another way. She tells him he should probably go home.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} whether William {{had a hand}} in the murder of the De-Witt brothers will always remain unanswered, like his exact role in the later Massacre of Glencoe. The fact that he ordered the withdrawal of a federal cavalry detachment, that otherwise might have prevented the lynching, has always raised eyebrows, however, like {{the fact that he did}} not prosecute the well-known ringleaders like Cornelis Tromp and his relative, Johan Kievit, the Buat conspirator, who now was appointed pensionary of Rotterdam, and even advanced their careers. <b>But</b> <b>maybe</b> firm measures against the conspirators were not feasible in the political climate of those fraught days in the Fall of 1672.|$|E
25|$|In Faraday's {{model of}} {{electromagnetic}} induction, a circuit received an induced current when it cut lines of magnetic flux. According to this model, the Faraday disc should have worked when either the disc or the magnet was rotated, but not both. Faraday attempted {{to explain the}} disagreement with observation by assuming that the magnet's field, complete with its lines of flux, remained stationary as the magnet rotated (a completely accurate picture, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> not intuitive in the lines-of-flux model). In other words, the lines of flux have their own frame of reference. As we shall see in the next section, modern physics (since {{the discovery of the}} electron) does not need the lines-of-flux picture and dispels the paradox.|$|E

A second solo album, A Good Week's Work, followed in 1999 and a third No Ifs, <b>Buts,</b> <b>Maybes</b> in 2006, both recorded in Sweden.

25|$|Görgei was so {{angered by}} the partial failure of that days {{military}} actions (although the Hungarian advancement, they could not breach the enemy lines, deciding {{the fate of the}} battle), that he dismissed Knezić from the lead of the III. corps because of his passivity, but also Asbóth from the lead of the II. corps, although he was the only corps commander, who accomplished his tasks. Allegedly Görgei was angered of him because his troops suffered too many losses during their attack. In their place were put: Colonel József Kászonyi in the lead of the II. corps, and Colonel Károly Leiningen-Westerburg in the lead of the III. corps. While Leiningen will demonstrate to be an excellent choice, Kászonyi's appointment in the place of Asbóth, will show to be an unlucky choice. To change the corps commanders {{in the middle of a}} battle, was also a bad decision, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> the worst thing was that he did not kept under a direct control and observation his corps commanders - especially the hesitating Knezić - in order to make them to move in the right moment to the battlefield. He chose to be on the battlefield to encourage his soldiers and officers, task which he accomplished with great success, turning many times the tides of the battle with his presence, personal example and words of encouragement.|$|E
500|$|Weak agnosticism (also called [...] "soft", [...] "open", [...] "empirical", or [...] "temporal agnosticism"): The {{view that}} the {{existence}} or nonexistence of any deities is currently unknown but is not necessarily unknowable; therefore, one will withhold judgment until evidence, if any, becomes available.

500|$|However, many reviews were {{extremely}} {{happy about the}} return of Andy Buckley, who portrayed David Wallace. A review from TV Equals noted that [...] "I’m not totally convinced that David Wallace’s story {{is as simple as}} the one he tells, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> that’s just because I’d love any excuse for him to work his way back into the story lines for The Office."

500|$|Before the film's release, reporters {{speculated that}} it would have a {{difficult}} run due to competition from DreamWorks' Shrek (a wholly CGI feature) and [...] (an action-adventure film from Paramount Pictures). Regarding the market's shift from traditional animation and competition with CGI films, Kirk Wise said, [...] "Any traditional animator, including myself, can't help but feel a twinge. I think it always comes down to story and character, and one form won't replace the other. Just like photography didn't replace painting. <b>But</b> <b>maybe</b> I'm blind to it."

500|$|Rice {{initially}} {{expressed an}} adamant stance against fan fiction {{based on her}} works, and particularly in opposition to such fiction based on The Vampire Chronicles, releasing a statement on April 7, 2000, that disallowed all such efforts, citing copyright issues. She subsequently requested that FanFiction.Net remove stories featuring her characters. In 2012, Metro reported that Rice developed a milder stance on the issue. [...] "I got upset about 20 years ago because I thought it would block me," [...] she said. [...] "However, it's been very easy to avoid reading any, so live and let live.

After U2 guitarist the Edge worked individually with Rubin in Los Angeles, the group spent two weeks in September 2006 completing songs with the producer at Abbey Road Studios in London. Later that year, the band released two songs from these sessions on the compilation album U218 Singles: a cover of the Skids' [...] "The Saints Are Coming" [...] with Green Day, and [...] "Window in the Skies". In January 2007, lead singer Bono said U2 intended to take their next album in a different musical direction from their previous few releases.

500|$|As {{the format}} of Inside No. 9 {{requires}} new characters each week, the writers were able to attract actors {{who may have been}} unwilling to commit to an entire series. In addition to Pemberton and Shearsmith, [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] starred Denis Lawson, Joyce Veheary, Oona Chaplin and Kayvan Novak. Pemberton commented on the appropriateness of casting Chaplin, a grandchild of the silent film star Charlie Chaplin, in an episode with little dialogue. Shearsmith stressed that the episode should not be considered a silent film {{in the same way as}} Charlie Chaplin's, elsewhere saying that the casting was [...] "almost an accident <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> a little nod". Bruce Dessau, writing in The Independent, described the casting choice as [...] "a satisfying nod to silent cinema". Both Oona Chaplin and the Inside No. 9 executive producer Jon Plowman stressed, however, that there was no significance in the casting. Chaplin also said that her character was very unlike herself, explaining that the [...] "big boobs, the heels, the blonde wig ... freed [...] up amazingly".|$|E
