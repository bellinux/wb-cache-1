40|$|Barrier {{activity}} {{of skin and}} internal <b>barrier-forming</b> epithelial linings are conferred by a lipid-corneocyte structure (stratum corneum in skin). The integrity of the corneocytes depends on the outer cornified envelope and is essential for maintenance of barrier function. During epidermal development and differentiation, proteins are sequentially incorporated into the envelope via action of epidermal transglutaminases in a well documented process. However, recent knockouts of major cornified envelope constituents have failed to disrupt barrier function significantly, suggesting that additional unidentified components are involved. We report a new gene cluster in the epidermal differentiation complex at human 1 q 21 encoding a family of 18 proteins that are substrates for epidermal transglutaminases. These proteins incorporate into the cornified envelope late in development and late {{in the process of}} envelope maturation during epidermal differentiation. The genes cluster within the epidermal differentiation complex according to expression pattern, i. e., epidermally expressed proteins cluster together while proteins from internal <b>barrier-forming</b> epithelia also cluster. We propose that these proteins modulate barrier activity over the surface of the animal, in a manner analogous to that proposed for the well characterized cornified envelope precursors, the small proline-rich proteins. To emphasize the incorporation of these proteins late in envelope assembly, we call the human proteins late envelope proteins...|$|E
40|$|Claudins are {{a family}} of {{proteins}} that forms paracellular barriers and pores determining tight junctions (TJ) permeability. Claudin- 16 and - 19 are pore forming TJ proteins allowing calcium and magnesium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TAL). Loss-of-function mutations in the encoding genes, initially identified to cause Familial Hypomagnesemia with Hypercalciuria and Nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC), were recently shown to be also involved in Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI). In addition, both claudins were expressed in the murine tooth germ and Claudin- 16 knockout (KO) mice displayed abnormal enamel formation. Claudin- 3, an ubiquitous claudin expressed in epithelia including kidney, acts as a <b>barrier-forming</b> tight junction protein. We determined that, similarly to claudin- 16 and claudin- 19, claudin- 3 was expressed in the tooth germ, more precisely in the TJ located at the apical end of secretory ameloblasts. The observation of Claudin- 3 KO teeth revealed enamel defects associated to impaired TJ structure at the secretory ends of ameloblasts and accumulation of matrix proteins in the forming enamel. Thus, claudin- 3 protein loss-of-function disturbs amelogenesis similarly to claudin- 16 loss-of-function, highlighting the importance of claudin proteins for the TJ structure. These findings unravel that loss-of-function of either pore or <b>barrier-forming</b> TJ proteins leads to enamel defects. Hence, the major structural function of claudin proteins appears essential for amelogenesis...|$|E

Recent advancements {{have led to}} a more highly resolved NPC structure. However, our understanding of the NPC modus operandi that facilitates transport selectivity, and speed, of diverse cargoes remains incomplete. For the most part, assorted cargo-complexes of different sizes traverse the NPC central channel in milliseconds, yet {{little is known about the}} nanoscopic movements of its <b>barrier-forming</b> Phe-Gly nucleoporins (FG Nups) and related sub-structures at transport-relevant time and length scales. Here, we discuss how dynamic FG Nup behavior may confer NPCs with an effective permeability barrier according to the functional needs of the cell. Moreover, we postulate that structural flexibility might resonate throughout the NPC framework from the cytoplasmic filaments to the nuclear basket...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear pore {{complexes}} (NPCs) conduct nucleocytoplasmic {{transport and}} gain transport selectivity through nucleoporin FG domains. Here, we report a structural {{analysis of the}} FG Nup 62 • 58 • 54 complex, which is a crucial component of the transport system. It comprises a ≈ 13 nm long trimerization interface with an unusual 2 W 3 F coil, a canonical heterotrimeric coiled coil, and a kink that enforces a compact six-helix bundle. Nup 54 also contains a ferredoxin-like domain. We further identified a heterotrimeric Nup 93 -binding module for NPC anchorage. The quaternary structure alternations in the Nup 62 complex, which were previously proposed to trigger a general NPC-gating, are incompatible with the trimer structure. We suggest that the highly elongated Nup 62 complex projects <b>barrier-forming</b> FG-repeats far into the central NPC channel, supporting a barrier that guards the entire cross-section...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been debated whether the red pulp of human spleens harbors an open or a closed microcirculation or both. To solve this issue, the authors {{differentially}} stained the endothelium in red pulp arterial microvessels and in venous sinuses using brightfield and fluorescence immunohistology with reagents against CD 34 and CD 141. Three-dimensional models of red pulp arterial microvessels and sinuses were derived from serial double-stained paraffin sections {{with the help of}} license-free open-access software. In each model, arterial microvascular ends were traced and verified by reference to the original serial sections. In total, 142 ends were analyzed in the specimens of three individuals. None of these ends was connected to a sinus, suggesting that the human splenic red pulp harbors an entirely open circulatory system. Thus, the spleen is the only human organ where blood passes through spaces not lined by endothelia or other <b>barrier-forming</b> cells...|$|E
40|$|During development, many epithelia {{are formed}} by a mesenchymal-epithelial {{transition}} (MET). Here, {{we examine the}} major stages and underlying mechanisms of MET during blood-brain barrier formation in Drosophila. We show that contact with the basal lamina {{is essential for the}} growth of the <b>barrier-forming</b> subperineurial glia (SPG). Septate junctions (SJs), which provide insulation of the paracellular space, are not required for MET, but are necessary for the establishment of polarized SPG membrane compartments. In vivo time-lapse imaging reveals that the Moody GPCR signaling pathway regulates SPG cell growth and shape, with different levels of signaling causing distinct phenotypes. Timely, well-coordinated SPG growth is essential for the uniform insertion of SJs and thus the insulating function of the barrier. To our knowledge, this is the first dynamic in vivo analysis of all stages in the formation of a secondary epithelium, and of the key role trimeric G protein signaling plays in this important morphogenetic process...|$|E
40|$|The tight {{junction}} determines paracellular transport having mainly sealing function. However, numerous {{tight junction}} proteins {{belonging to the}} family of claudins mediate permeability by forming paracellular channels with specific selectivity for cations, anions or water. The first subchapter of this essay deals with a channel-forming tight junction protein. It was shown that the so far uncharacterized claudin- 17 forms anion-selective paracellular channels and was predominantly localized within the nephron. The observed anion selectivity was determinated by charged amino acids of its both extracellular loops. Transfer of these positions onto a structural model of claudin- 17 showed that the respective residues were located at the beginning, inside {{and at the end of}} a hypothetical furrow of the claudin- 17 based channel. Based on these results a first hypothetical structural model of a claudin-polymer-formed anion channel was presented. The second subchapter focused on <b>barrier-forming</b> tight junction proteins. These qualify as targets of absorption enhancers affecting the paracellular barrier. Absorption enhancers are used to allow epi- and endothelial uptake of mid-size and macromolecular solutes, e. g. pharmaceuticals, which are usually hardly resorbed. For this, they open the tight junction transiently. Three different approaches for enhanced absorption were presented. In the first study, a signaling pathway involved in the absorption enhancer-facilitated uptake of local anesthetics at the peripheral blood-nerve-barrier was elucidated resulting in down-regulation of claudin- 1. The second study suitable mutations of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin were used for interaction with several <b>barrier-forming</b> claudins resulting in loss of barrier function. In the third study, effects of the fatty acid salt caprate were analyzed, resulting in tow findings: while the claudin- 5 was removed from the bicellular tight junction, tricellulin was removed from the tricellular tight junction. Using fluorescence imaging we further showed that a 607 Da-sized molecule (biotin) was passing the tricellular tight junction after caprate application. From these data hypothesize a novel way of paracellular transport for ions and macromolecules: while ions and small solutes pass the bicellular tight junction in quantitatively relevant amounts through claudin-based paracellular channels, macromolecules pass through the 10 nm big central pore of the tricellular tight junction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{formation}} of stable cell–cell contacts {{is required for}} the generation of <b>barrier-forming</b> sheets of epithelial and endothelial cells. During various physiological processes like tissue development, wound healing or tumorigenesis, cellular junctions are reorganized to allow the release or the incorporation of individual cells. Cell–cell contact formation is regulated by multiprotein complexes which are localized at speciWc structures along the lateral cell junctions like the tight junctions and adherens junctions and which are targeted to these site through their association with cell adhesion molecules. Recent evidence indicates that several major protein complexes exist which have distinct functions during junction formation. However, this evidence also indicates that their composition is dynamic and subject to changes depending on the state of junction maturation. Thus, cell–cell contact formation and integrity is regulated by a complex network of protein complexes. Imbalancing this network by oncogenic proteins or pathogens results in barrier breakdown and eventually in cancer. Here, I will review the molecular organization of the major multiprotein complexes at junctions of epithelial cells and discuss their function in cell–cell contact formation and maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Lumen {{expansion}} {{driven by}} hydrostatic pressure occurs during many morphogenetic processes. Although {{it is well}} established {{that members of the}} Claudin family of transmembrane tight junction proteins determine paracellular tightness within epithelial/endothelial barrier systems, functional evidence for their role in the morphogenesis of lumenized organs has been scarce. Here, we identify Claudin 5 a as a core component of an early cerebral-ventricular barrier system that is required for ventricular lumen expansion in the zebrafish embryonic brain before the establishment of the embryonic blood–brain barrier. Loss of Claudin 5 a or expression of a tight junction-opening Claudin 5 a mutant reduces brain ventricular volume expansion without disrupting the polarized organization of the neuroepithelium. Perfusion experiments with the electron-dense small molecule lanthanum nitrate reveal that paracellular tightness of the cerebral-ventricular barrier decreases upon loss of Claudin 5 a. Genetic analyses show that the apical neuroepithelial localization of Claudin 5 a depends on epithelial cell polarity and provide evidence for concerted activities between Claudin 5 a and Na+,K+-ATPase during luminal expansion of brain ventricles. These data establish an essential role of a <b>barrier-forming</b> Claudin in ventricular lumen expansion, thereby contributing to brain morphogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Drug {{absorption}} {{across the}} gastrointestinal epithelium can occur physiologically via transcellular and paracellular pathways, {{but may be}} limited by specific molecular traits. Hydrophilic drugs pose a special challenge in drug development as they cannot pass the lipid bilayer of the cell’s membrane without specific uptake mechanisms and depend on a paracellular passage through the intercellular space. This passage {{is characterized by a}} passive permeability that can be specifically modified through the <b>barrier-forming</b> proteins of the tight junction. In the context of optimizing systemic and organ-selective drug application methods, ab-sorption enhancement attempts the selective and reversible regulation of the epithelial intestinal barrier, thereby facilitating the temporary passage of macromolecules. Laurate, a medium-chain fatty acid, occuring in foods such as coconut oil, cow’s and human milk, as well as the xenobiotic peptide melittin, occurring in bee’s poison, have both come into focus as novel absorption enhancers improving transepithelial drug uptake. The mechanisms by which they affect the epithelial barrier, however, are not yet fully understood. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the effects of laurate and melittin on paracellular permeability and tight junction proteins in confluent monolayers of the intestinal epithelial cell line HT- 29 /B 6. Exposure with 3. 5 mM laurate resulted in a reversible decrease in transepithelial resistance down to 50 % of initial values, identified to be the result of an exclusive drop in paracellular resistance by two-path impedance spectroscopy. Laurate exposure induced an increase in the permeability for fluorescein (330 Da), whereas permeability for biotin (600 Da) or FITC-dextran (4 kDa) did not increase. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy revealed a decrease of claudin- 5 within tight junction com-plexes for laurate, without effects on other <b>barrier-forming</b> tight junction proteins including tricellulin, a barrier former preventing the paracellular passage of macromolecules. While 0. 3 μM melittin induced a drop in TER down to 60 % of initial values, permeability did not markedly increase. In accordance with the flux experiments, protein expression and distribution in melittin-exposed cells remained unchanged. In conclusion, Melittin does not induce any significant increase in permeability and is therefore not considered a candidate for absorption enhancement in HT- 29 /B 6 cells. Laurate, however, induced increased paracellular permeability for smaller molecules without affecting either tricellular cell contacts or the paracellular passage of macromolecules. Laurate’s suitability as an enhancer of a size-selective drug uptake for smaller molecules suggests minimal adverse effects of an unwanted passage of larger compounds such as toxins and immunomodulatory agents...|$|E
40|$|The late {{cornified}} envelope (LCE) {{gene cluster}} within the epidermal differentiation complex on human chromosome one (mouse chromosome three) contains multiple conserved genes encoding stratum-corneum proteins. Within the LCE cluster, genes form “groups” based on chromosomal position and protein homology. We link a recently accepted nomenclature for the LCE cluster (formerly XP 5, small proline-rich-like, late-envelope protein genes) to gene structure, groupings, and chromosomal organization, {{and carry out}} a pan-cluster quantitative expression analysis {{in a variety of}} tissues and environmental conditions. This analysis shows that (i) the cluster organizes into two “skin” expressing groups and a third group with low-level, tissue-specific expression patterns in all <b>barrier-forming</b> epithelia tested, including internal epithelia; (ii) LCE genes respond “group-wise” to environmental stimuli such as calcium levels and ultraviolet (UV) light, highlighting the functional significance of groups; (iii) in response to UV stimulation there is massive upregulation of a single, normally quiescent, non-skin LCE gene; and (iv) heterogeneity occurs between individuals with one individual lacking expression of an LCE skin gene without overt skin disease, suggesting LCE genes affect subtle attributes of skin function. This quantitative and pan-cluster expression analysis suggests that LCE groups have distinct functions and that within groups regulatory diversification permits specific responsiveness to environmental challenge...|$|E
40|$|The {{epidermal}} barrier varies {{over the}} body surface to accommodate regional environmental stresses. Regional skin barrier variation is produced by site-dependent epidermal differentiation from common keratinocyte precursors and often manifests as site-specific skin disease or irritation. There is strong evidence for body-site-dependent dermal programming of epidermal differentiation in which the epidermis responds by altering expression of key barrier proteins, but the underlying mechanisms have not been defined. The LCE multigene cluster encodes barrier proteins that are differentially expressed {{over the body}} surface, and perturbation of LCE cluster expression {{is linked to the}} common regional skin disease psoriasis. LCE subclusters comprise genes expressed variably in either external <b>barrier-forming</b> epithelia (e. g. skin) or in internal epithelia with less stringent barriers (e. g. tongue). We demonstrate here that a complex of TALE homeobox transcription factors PBX 1, PBX 2 and Pknox (homologues of Drosophila Extradenticle and Homothorax) preferentially regulate external rather than internal LCE gene expression, competitively binding with SP 1 and SP 3. Perturbation of TALE protein expression in stratified squamous epithelia in mice produces external but not internal barrier abnormalities. We conclude that epidermal barrier genes, such as the LCE multigene cluster, are regulated by TALE homeodomain transcription factors to produce regional epidermal barriers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paracellular {{barrier of}} epithelia and endothelia is {{established}} by several tight junction proteins including claudin- 3. Although claudin- 3 {{is present in}} many epithelia including skin, lung, kidney, and intestine and in endothelia, its function is unresolved as yet. We therefore characterized claudin- 3 by stable transfection of MDCK II kidney tubule cells with human claudin- 3 cDNA. Two clone systems were analyzed, exhibiting high or low claudin- 2 expression, respectively. Expression of other claudins was unchanged. Ultrastructurally, tight junction strands were changed toward uninterrupted and rounded meshwork loops. Functionally, the paracellular resistance of claudin- 3 -transfected monolayers was strongly elevated, causing an increase in transepithelial resistance compared to vector controls. Permeabilities for mono- and divalent cations and for anions were decreased. In the high-claudin- 2 system, claudin- 3 reduced claudin- 2 -induced cation selectivity, while in the low-claudin- 2 system no charge preference was observed, the latter thus reflecting the "intrinsic" action of claudin- 3. Furthermore, {{the passage of the}} paracellular tracers fluorescein (332 Da) and FD- 4 (4 kDa) was decreased, whereas the permeability to water was not affected. We demonstrate that claudin- 3 alters the tight junction meshwork and seals the paracellular pathway against the passage of small ions of either charge and uncharged solutes. Thus, in a kidney model epithelium, claudin- 3 acts as a general <b>barrier-forming</b> protein...|$|E
40|$|Hydrazine {{passes through}} two {{transition}} states, TS 1 () 0 °) and TS 2 () 180 °), {{in the course}} of internal rotation around its N-N bond. The origin of the corresponding rotational barriers in hydrazine has been extensively studied by experimental and theoretical methods. Here, we used natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and energy decomposition of rotational barrier energy (¢Ebarrier) to understand the origin of the torsional potential energy profile of this molecule. ¢Ebarrier was dissected into structural (¢Estruc), steric exchange (¢Esteric), and hyperconjugative (¢Edeloc) energy contributions. In both transition states, the major <b>barrier-forming</b> contribution is ¢Edeloc. The TS 2 barrier is lowered by pyramidalization of nitrogen atoms through lowering ¢Estruc, not by N-N bond lengthening through lowering ¢Esteric. Higher pyramidality of nitrogen atoms of TS 2 than that of TS 1 explains well why the N-N bond of TS 2 is longer than that of TS 1. Finally, the steric repulsion between nitrogen lone pairs does not determine the rotational barrier; nuclear-nuclear Coulombic repulsion between outer H/H atoms in TS 1 {{plays an important role in}} increasing ¢Estruc. Taken together, we explain the reason for the different TS 1 and TS 2 barriers. We show that NBO analysis is a useful tool for understanding structures and potential energy surfaces of compounds containing the N-N bond. 1...|$|E
40|$|Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) are {{euryhaline}} teleost and evolved divergently {{from the}} well-studied model organism zebrafish (Danio rerio). Claudins (cldns) are tight junction proteins known {{to regulate the}} permeability of the paracellular space, but {{little is known about}} the influence of the endocrine system on their regulation. In this study, in vitro gill culture model was used to test the effect of three osmoregulatory hormones (cortisol, growth hormone, and prolactin) on eight cldns previously identified in the gills of medaka. The stress hormone cortisol generally up-regulated the genes studied from 1. 2 - to 5 -fold at the exceptions of cldn- 28 a and - 28 b. Growth hormone had little effect and only increased the transcription of cldn- 10 f 2. 5 -fold, while prolactin up-regulated the expression of cldn- 28 b, - 10 c, and - 10 f, to 2 -, 2. 5 -, and 2 -fold respectively. The results support the hypothesis that cldns- 27 a, - 28 a, - 28 b, and - 30 c are <b>barrier-forming</b> cldns, with - 28 b being induced by FW conditions. Further experiments need to be performed before the hormonal regulation of cldn- 10 isoforms can be fully understood. The in vitro model shown here is a useful tool to resolve endocrine control of gill proteins involved in osmoregulation. Further investigation of the possible interactions of cortisol and prolactin or growth hormone would improve the understanding of claudin regulation by hormones...|$|E
40|$|The {{intestinal}} epithelium {{serves as}} a major protective barrier between the mammalian host and the external environment. Here we show that the transmembrane serine protease matriptase plays a pivotol role in the formation and integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier. St 14 hypomorphic mice, which have a 100 -fold reduction in intestinal matriptase mRNA levels, display a 35 % reduction in intestinal transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Matriptase is expressed during intestinal epithelial differentiation and colocalizes with E-cadherin to apical junctional complexes (AJC) in differentiated polarized Caco- 2 monolayers. Inhibition of matriptase activity using a specific peptide inhibitor or by knockdown of matriptase by siRNA disrupts the development of TEER in <b>barrier-forming</b> Caco- 2 monolayers and increases paracellular permeability to macromolecular FITC-dextran. Loss of matriptase was associated with enhanced expression and incorporation of the permeability-associated, “leaky” tight junction protein claudin- 2 at intercellular junctions. Knockdown of claudin- 2 enhanced the development of TEER in matriptase-silenced Caco- 2 monolayers, suggesting that the reduced barrier integrity was caused, at least in part, by an inability to regulate claudin- 2 expression and incorporation into junctions. We find that matriptase enhances the rate of claudin- 2 protein turnover, {{and that this is}} mediated indirectly through an atypical PKCζ-dependent signaling pathway. These results support a key role for matriptase in regulating intestinal epithelial barrier competence, and suggest an intriguing link between pericellular serine protease activity and tight junction assembly in polarized epithelia...|$|E
40|$|Tight Junctions (TJ) {{regulate}} paracellular permeability {{of tissue}} barriers. Claudins (Cld) form {{the backbone of}} TJ-strands. Pore-forming claudins determine the permeability for ions, whereas that for solutes and macromolecules {{is assumed to be}} crucially restricted by the strand morphology (i. e., density, branching and continuity). To investigate determinants of the morphology of TJ-strands we established a novel approach using localization microscopy. TJ-strands were reconstituted by stable transfection of HEK 293 cells with the <b>barrier-forming</b> Cld 3 or Cld 5. Strands were investigated at cell-cell contacts by Spectral Position Determination Microscopy (SPDM), a method of localization microscopy using standard fluorophores. Extended TJ-networks of Cld 3 -YFP and Cld 5 -YFP were observed. For each network, 200, 000 to 1, 100, 000 individual molecules were detected with a mean localization accuracy of ∼ 20 nm, yielding a mean structural resolution of ∼ 50 nm. Compared to conventional fluorescence microscopy, this strongly improved the visualization of strand networks and enabled quantitative morphometric analysis. Two populations of elliptic meshes (mean diameter < 100 nm and 300 - 600 nm, respectively) were revealed. For Cld 5 the two populations were more separated than for Cld 3. Discrimination of non-polymeric molecules and molecules within polymeric strands was achieved. For both subtypes of claudins the mean density of detected molecules was similar and estimated to be ∼ 24 times higher within the strands than outside the strands. The morphometry and single molecule information provided advances the mechanistic analysis of paracellular barriers. Applying this novel method to different TJ-proteins is expected to significantly improve the understanding of TJ on the molecular level...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Epithelia are <b>barrier-forming</b> tissues {{that protect}} the {{organism}} against external noxious stimuli. Despite the similarity in function of epithelia, only few common protective mechanisms that are employed by these tissues have been systematically studied. Comparative analysis of genome-wide expression profiles generated {{by means of}} Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) is a powerful approach to yield further insight into epithelial host defense mechanisms. We performed an extensive comparative analysis of previously published SAGE data sets of two types of epithelial cells, namely bronchial epithelial cells and keratinocytes, in which the response to pro-inflammatory cytokines was assessed. These data sets were used to elucidate a common denominator in epithelial host defense. Results Bronchial epithelial cells and keratinocytes {{were found to have}} a high degree of overlap in gene expression. Using an in silico approach, an epithelial-specific molecular signature of gene expression was identified in bronchial epithelial cells and keratinocytes comprising of family members of keratins, small proline-rich proteins and proteinase inhibitors. Whereas some of the identified genes were known to be involved in inflammation, the majority of the signature represented genes that were previously not associated with host defense. Using polymerase chain reaction, presence of expression of selected tissue-specific genes was validated. Conclusion Our comparative analysis of gene transcription reveals that bronchial epithelial cells and keratinocytes both express a subset of genes that is likely to be essential in epithelial barrier formation in these cell types. The expression of these genes is specific for bronchial epithelial cells and keratinocytes and is not seen in non-epithelial cells. We show that bronchial epithelial cells, similar to keratinocytes, express components that are able to form a cross-linked protein envelope that may contribute to an effective barrier against noxious stimuli and pathogens. </p...|$|E
40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) are significant environmental contaminants {{as they are}} present naturally as well as anthropogenically in soil, air and water. In spite of their low solubility, PAHs are spread to the environment, and they are present in surface water, industrial effluent or groundwater. Amongst all remediation technologies for treating groundwater contaminated with PAHs, {{the use of a}} permeable reactive biobarrier (PRBB) appears to be the most cost-effective, energy efficient, and environmentally sound approach. In this technology, the microorganisms are used as reactive medium to degrade or stabilize the contaminants. The main limits of this approach are that the microorganisms or consortium used for forming the PRBB should show adequate characteristics. They must be retained in the <b>barrier-forming</b> biofilm, and they should also have degradative ability for the target pollutants. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the viability of Arthrobacter viscosus as bioreactive medium for forming PRBB. Initially, the ability of A. viscosus to remove PAHs, benzo[a]anthracene 100 μM and phenanthrene 100 μM was evaluated operating in a batch bench-scale bioreactor. In both cases, total benzo[a]anthracene and phenanthrene removals were obtained after 7 and 3 days, respectively. Furthermore, the viability of the microorganisms was evaluated in the presence of chromium in a continuous mode. As a final point, the adhesion of A. viscosus to sepiolite forming a bioreactive material to build PRBB was demonstrated. In view of the attained results, it can be concluded that A. viscosus could be a suitable microorganism to form a bioreactive medium for PAHs remediation.

40|$|TRPC 4 is well {{recognized}} as a prominent cation channel in the vascular endothelium, but its contribution to agonist-induced endothelial Ca 2 + entry is still a matter of controversy. Here we report that the cellular targeting and Ca 2 + signaling function of TRPC 4 {{is determined by the}} state of cell-cell adhesions during endothelial phenotype transitions. TRPC 4 surface expression in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC- 1) increased with the formation of cell-cell contacts. Epidermal growth factor recruited TRPC 4 into the plasma membrane of proliferating cells but initiated retrieval of TRPC 4 from the plasma membrane in quiescent, <b>barrier-forming</b> cells. Epidermal growth factor-induced Ca 2 + entry was strongly promoted by the formation of cell-cell contacts, and both siRNA and dominant negative knockdown experiments revealed that TRPC 4 mediates stimulated Ca 2 + entry exclusively in proliferating clusters that form immature cell-cell contacts. TRPC 4 co-precipitated with the junctional proteins β-catenin and VE-cadherin. Analysis of cellular localization of fluorescent fusion proteins provided further evidence for recruitment of TRPC 4 into junctional complexes. Analysis of TRPC 4 function in the HEK 293 expression system identified β-catenin as a signaling molecule that enables cell-cell contact-dependent promotion of TRPC 4 function. Our results place TRPC 4 as a Ca 2 + entry channel that is regulated by cell-cell contact formation and interaction with β-catenin. TRPC 4 is suggested to serve stimulated Ca 2 + entry in a specific endothelial state during the transition from a proliferating to a quiescent phenotype. Thus, TRPC 4 may adopt divergent, as yet unappreciated functions in endothelial Ca 2 + homeostasis and emerges as a potential key player in endothelial phenotype switching and tuning of cellular growth factor signaling...|$|E

We focus on the pathophysiology of C. concisus {{and the effects of}} different clinical oral and fecal C. concisus strains on human HT- 29 /B 6 colon cells. Six oral and eight fecal strains of C. concisus were isolated. Mucus-producing HT- 29 /B 6 epithelial monolayers were infected with the C. concisus strains. Transepithelial electrical resistance (R(t)) and tracer fluxes of different molecule size were measured in Ussing chambers. Tight junction (TJ) protein expression was determined by Western blotting, and subcellular TJ distribution was analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Apoptosis induction was examined by TUNEL-staining and Western blot of caspase- 3 activation. All strains invaded confluent HT- 29 /B 6 cells and impaired epithelial barrier function, characterized by a time- and dose-dependent decrease in R(t) either after infection from the apical side but even more from the basolateral compartment. TJ protein expression changes were sparse, only in apoptotic areas of infected monolayers TJ proteins were redistributed. Solely the <b>barrier-forming</b> TJ protein claudin- 5 showed a reduced expression level to 66 ± 8 % (P< 0. 05), by expression regulation from the gene. Concomitantly, Lactate dehydrogenase release was elevated to 3. 1 ± 0. 3 % versus 0. 7 ± 0. 1 % in control (P< 0. 001), suggesting cytotoxic effects. Furthermore, oral and fecal C. concisus strains elevated apoptotic events to 5 -fold. C. concisus-infected monolayers revealed an increased permeability for 332 Da fluorescein (1. 74 ± 0. 13 vs. 0. 56 ± 0. 17 10 (- 6) cm/s in control, P< 0. 05) but showed no difference in permeability for 4 kDa FITC-dextran (FD- 4). The same was true in camptothecin-exposed monolayers, where camptothecin was used for apoptosis induction. In conclusion, epithelial barrier dysfunction by oral and fecal C. concisus strains could mainly be assigned to apoptotic leaks together with moderate TJ changes, demonstrating a leak-flux mechanism that parallels the clinical manifestation of diarrhea...|$|E
40|$|The {{blood-brain barrier}} is {{characterized}} by still poorly understood barrier and transport functions performed by specialized endothelial cells. Hybridoma technology {{has been used to}} identify a protein termed neurothelin that is specific for these endothelial cells. Neurothelin is defined by the species-specific mouse mAb 1 W 5 raised against lentil- lectin-binding proteins of neural tissue from embryonic chick. In the posthatch chick, neurothelin expression is found on endothelial cells within the brain but not on those of the systemic vascular system. Injection of the monoclonal antibody in vivo leads to labeling of brain capillaries, indicating that the corresponding antigen is expressed on the luminal surface of brain endothelial cells. Transplantation of embryonic mouse brain onto the chick chorioallantoic membrane results in rodent brain vascularization by the avian vascular system. Subsequently, normally mAb 1 W 5 -negative endothelial cells, originating from blood vessels of the chick chorioallantoic membrane, are induced to express neurothelin when they are in contact with mouse neural tissue. In contrast to differentiated brain neurons that do not express neurothelin, neurons of the nonvascularized chick retina synthesize neurothelin. However, neurothelin is not found on retinal ganglion cell axons terminating on 1 W 5 -negative brain cells. 1 W 5 immunoreactivity was also found in the pigment epithelium that forms the blood-eye barrier. Putting epithelial cells into culture results in concentration of neurothelin at cell-cell contact sites, leaving other cell surface areas devoid of antigen. Therefore, the distribution of neurothelin appears to be regulated by cell-cell interactions. In Western blot analysis, neurothelin was identified as a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 43 kD. The protein bears at least one intramolecular disulfide bridge and sulfated glucuronic acid as well as alpha-D- substituted mannose/glucose moieties. The exclusive neurothelin expression in the posthatch chick on endothelial cells of the central nervous system but not on systemic endothelial cells makes neurothelin a marker specific for blood-brain <b>barrier-forming</b> endothelial cells. The spatiotemporally regulated neurothelin expression in neurons suggests an interaction between vascularization and neuronal differentiation...|$|E
40|$|Loss {{of neurons}} {{is a key}} {{macroscopic}} feature that unites all neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington’s disease (HD) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These diseases affect distinct neuronal subtypes, e. g. striatum and cortex in HD and motor neurons in ALS. However, {{it is clear that}} common molecular mechanisms may underlie pathogenic features of each disease. Currently, there is no disease modifying treatment for HD or ALS. It is critical to elucidate the specific mechanisms leading to pathogenesis. A single gene mutation, a CAG repeat expansion within the HD gene, causes HD. In contrast, 90 % of all cases of ALS are sporadic and of the known gene mutations that cause familial versions of the disease, there are several contributing genes with the C 9 orf 72 mutation accounting for the majority. Ultimately, in both diseases, numerous cellular functions are impacted including protein homeostasis, transcriptional regulation, cellular signaling, and bioenergetics; causing dysfunction and cell death. A shared pathogenic feature which seems, at least in part, to be causative is the dysregulation of gene expression. In order to study this and other pathogenic mechanisms, we utilized patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from both HD and ALS subjects and differentiated them into relevant cell types. For HD, mixed neural cells directed towards a striatal fate and brain endothelial cells (BECs) were generated, and motor neurons generated from ALS subjects. These cells were compared to lines generated from unaffected, healthy subjects for unbiased “omics” analysis to identify potential mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. My data suggest that mutant Huntingtin impairs neurodevelopmental pathways that could disrupt synaptic homeostasis and increase vulnerability to the expanded polyglutamine repeats over time. Additionally, I provide the first iPSC-derived <b>barrier-forming</b> EC model for a neurodegenerative disease to date, demonstrating specific barrier defects that may underlie crucial aspects of HD pathology. RNA-seq analysis was also performed for iPSC-derived ALS motor neurons as a component of a large consortium effort to identify cell-based signatures. Alternative splicing and mislocalization of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) appears to also contribute to ALS pathogenesis, and here we identify RBPs that could contribute to this aberrant alternative splicing and dysregulated RNA biology...|$|E
40|$|Epithelial and endothelial cells {{constitute}} pharmacological {{barriers in}} organs {{such as the}} perineurium and the blood-brain barrier, which efficiently limit the delivery of hydrophilic drugs into the peripheral and central nervous system, respectively. As a consequence, specific treatment of pain via the perineurium or therapy of e. g. neurodegenerative diseases is hampered. Current strategies to improve drug penetration include unspecific opening of cell barriers using high doses, produce side-effects or need specific drug formulation which limits their clinical application. The paracellular tightening is mediated by specific claudin (Cld) subtypes. The extracellular loops (ECL) of these transmembrane proteins close the paracellular gap against uncontrolled diffusion. As different barriers show tissue specific Cld subtype patterns, their modulation is a promising strategy to improve drug release and to enable safe and reliable drug access through cell barriers. Aimed at paracellular opening, peptidomimetics derived from ECL 1 and - 2 of Cld 1 - 5 were developed to modulate Cld interactions. Focusing on the Cld 1 peptide mC 1 C 2, their molecular, structural and binding properties were examined. In cell culture models exerting different Cld compositions, mC 1 C 2 application led to a redistribution of Cld 1 to - 5 from the plasma membrane to the cytosol, thereby compromising the barrier tightness. mC 1 C 2 was internalized within minutes, it interacted directly with Cld 1 and - 5 and indirectly with Cld 2 - 4. mC 1 C 2 modulated the Cld strand morphology and, starting 6 h after administration, reversibly increased the permeability for hydrophilic, usually barrier-impermeable molecules in a concentration dependent manner. These findings were confirmed in vivo in the Cld 1 -dominated perineurium, where mC 1 C 2 induced Cld 1 down-regulation by binding to Cld 1 and suppressing the transcription factor Cdx 2. For up to 48 h, a time- and dose depended opening of the perineurium was observed for hydrophilic compounds being perineurium-impermeable under normal conditions. Using a structure-/function approach, the active region of mC 1 C 2 was elucidated, an optimized derivative was developed and the activity of mC 1 C 2 was attributed to a β-sheet, flanked by an α-helix. These results {{provided the basis for}} the development of a model describing the spatial interaction of mC 1 C 2 and Cld 1. The knowledge about the molecular structure, function and regulation of claudins is extended in the light of their <b>barrier-forming</b> properties and as a target for pharmacological intervention. Furthermore, the data indicate that a peptide-based strategy to enhance drug permeation is promising to specifically, transiently and safely open cellular barriers for drug delivery...|$|E
40|$|Tight {{junctions}} {{regulate the}} transport of solutes and water through the paracellular pathway of epithelia and endothelia. Claudins are a large family of tight junction proteins which can functionally be categorized in channel- and <b>barrier-forming</b> claudins. Channel-forming claudins exhibit selectivity for anions, cations and/or water. All claudins have two extracellular loops (ECL 1 and - 2) and {{it is suggested that}} amino acid sequence of ECL 1 determines selectivity. Claudin- 17 is one of two known claudins with distinct anion selectivity. Its main abundance is in the proximal nephron. The molecular determinants of its anion selectivity are yet unknown and were characterized in this study. Using site-directed mutagenesis single amino acid substitutions were introduced in ECL 1 and ECL 2 of claudin- 17 to analyze their effect on anion selectivity. The analyzed amino acids can be grouped as followed: • Sequence alignment of human and mouse claudin- 17 revealed three prominent differences in ECL 1 primary structure. Mutating the charged amino acid arginine in the human claudin- 17 at positions 56, 59 and 61 to an amino acid with an uncharged side chain had no effect on anion selectivity. • The most intensively investigated amino acid in channel-forming claudins is position K 65 within ECL 1. In claudin- 17 three different mutants were generated and analyzed. Mutation K 65 A neutralized the charge, mutation K 65 E introduced the opposite charge and mutation K 65 R maintained net charge. Any of these electrical and structural changes lead to a loss of anion-selective properties of claudin- 17. • The charged amino acids arginine 31, glutamic acid 44, arginine 45 and glutamic acid 48 are located in the N-terminal half of ECL 1. Charge-neutralizing mutation at position 45 had no effect on claudin- 17 properties. However, loss of charge on any other of these positions abolished anion selectivity. • Two amino acids in ECL 2 were investigated as well. Only mutation H 154 A but not Y 149 A lead to a loss of anion selectivity of claudin- 17. The results of this study can be comprehended as followed: Besides position 65 which has been shown to determine charge selectivity in other channel-forming claudins, positions R 31, E 44 and E 48 are also crucial for anion selectivity in claudin- 17. Contrary to the assumption that only ECL 1 establishes charge selectivity, this study for the first time shows that H 154 within ECL 2 determines charge selectivity as well...|$|E
40|$|Die Bildung von CoSi$_{ 2 }$ bei der Festphasenreaktion duenner Co-Schichten mit Si(001) -Substraten bei verschiedenen Herstellungsverfahren wird elektronenmikroskopisch untersucht. Die Ergebnisse koennen mit RBS- und XRD-Resultaten korreliert werden. Praeparationsmethoden elektronentransparenter Proben werden erlaeutert. Die gebildeten Silicidschichten werden in bezug auf die enthaltenen Phasen und Orientierungsbeziehungen ihrer Kristallite untereinander und zum Si-Substrat charakterisiert. Es wird gezeigt, dass die Reaktion von Co-Schichten mit Si$_{ 1 -x}$C$_{x}$-Substraten (x <= 0. 005) zu einem mit wachsendem Kohlenstoffgehalt steigenden Anteil epitaktischer Kristallite in der gebildeten CoSi$_{ 2 }$-Schicht fuehrt. Die Ursache dafuer wird in der durch den Kohlenstoff behinderten Co-Diffusion gesehen. Die Rolle des Kohlenstoffs bei Diffusionsvorgaengen in Si wird diskutiert. Die Festphasenreaktion der Metall-Doppelschichtsysteme Co/Ti und Co/Hf auf Si(001) -Substraten mit dem Ziel der Epitaxie von CoSi$_{ 2 }$ wird in bezug auf die unterschiedliche Wirkung der Zwischenschichtmetalle Ti und Hf, als Bildner einer Co-Diffusionsbarriere, untersucht. Es werden eine CoSi-Zwischenphase mit Vorzugsorientierungen ihrer Kristallite und die Nukleation des angestrebten epitaktischen CoSi$_{ 2 }$ an der CoSi/Si-Grenzflaeche nachgewiesen. Die hoehere Qualitaet der epitaktischen CoSi$_{ 2 }$-Schichten aus dem Co/Ti/Si-System wird auf eine effektivere Diffusionsbarriere zurueckgefuehrt, welche eine hoehere CoSi$_{ 2 }$-Nukleationstemperatur bewirkt. Die gefundene Silicid-Phasensequenz wird unter thermodynamischen, kinetischen und strukturellen Gesichtspunkten diskutiert. The {{formation}} of CoSi$_{ 2 }$ by solid phase reaction using different methods is analysed {{by means of}} electron microscopy. The results correspond to RBS and XRD measurements. A description of the sample preparation for transmission electron microscopy is given. The formed silicide films are characterized {{with respect to the}} contents of different phases and the orientation relations between their crystallites and between them and the Si-substrate. For the reaction of Co films with Si$_{ 1 -x}$C$_{x}$-substrates (x <= 0. 005) it is shown that a rising carbon concentration of the Si-substrates leads to an increasing content of epitaxial crystallites in the CoSi$_{ 2 }$-films formed. The reason for {{this is supposed to be}} the limitation of the Co diffusion caused by the carbon. The role played by carbon in diffusion processes in Si is discussed. The solid phase reaction of the metallic bi-layers Co/Ti and Co/Hf with Si(001) -substrates aimed at CoSi$_{ 2 }$ epitaxy is analysed concerning the different effects produced by Ti and Hf as <b>barrier-forming</b> film materials. An intermediately appearing CoSi-phase with preferred orientations of its crystallites and the nucleation of the epitaxial CoSi$_{ 2 }$, aimed at, at the CoSi/Si-interface were found. The higher quality of the epitaxial CoSi$_{ 2 }$ obtained in the Co/Ti/Si-system is attributed to a more effective diffusion barrier in this film system, causing a higher CoSi$_{ 2 }$ nucleation temperature. The found sequence of silicide phases is discussed taking into consideration thermodynamical, kinetical and structural aspects...|$|E
