The Commission's purpose is to sustain the American spirit through acts of remembrance, not only on Memorial Day but also throughout the year, for those who died serving our country. Congress appropriated $ 1. 25 million to the Commission to fund its operations for fiscal years 2002 through 2005. In fiscal year 2005, the Commission received net appropriations of approximately $ 248, 000, along with cash and in-kind donations of approximately $ 103, 000 from individuals and businesses. In addition, it had approximately $ 244, 000 in unexpended appropriations from prior fiscal years. The Commission expended approximately $ 239, 000 of appropriated funds and funded costs of approximately $ 103, 000 with cash and in-kind donations received during the fiscal year. The National Moment of Remembrance Act requires GAO to annually audit the financial transactions of the Commission. However, as reflected in an Office of Management and <b>Budget</b> (OMB) <b>memorandum,</b> the Commission {{is subject to the}} Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002 which was enacted on November 7, 2002.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—This study {{examines}} {{the politics of}} appropriating Question 1  tobacco tax revenues in the first budget year after Massachusetts voters passed the ballot initiative in 1992.  The initiative increased the tobacco tax on cigarettes by 25  cents per pack and on smokeless tobacco by 25 % of the wholesale price.  METHODS—Data were collected from newspapers, letters, <b>memoranda,</b> <b>budgets,</b> press releases, legislative floor debates, government documents, legislative journals, personal interviews, and tobacco industry documents that were downloaded from the Tobacco Archives internet site.  RESULTS—During the first budget year, programmes mentioned by the initiative that were not exclusively tobacco related accounted for 27 % of total Question 1  expenditures, while 50 % of the revenues were allocated for programmes that were neither mentioned by the initiative nor provided any tobacco education, prevention, and cessation services. Only 23 % of Question 1  funds were appropriated for programmes that provided exclusively tobacco education, prevention, and cessation services. Question 1  revenues were also used to supplant funding for pre-existing programmes, which was explicitly prohibited by the initiative. The first budget year became the template for Question 1  appropriations in subsequent fiscal years.  CONCLUSION—Politics did not end after voters passed Question 1.  Public health advocates lacked a strategy and budget plan to influence the appropriation of Question 1  funds {{after the passage of}} this ballot initiative.    Keywords: Massachusetts; Question 1; tobacco ta...|$|R
