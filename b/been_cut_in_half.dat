5|$|Development since 1850 {{has greatly}} altered the {{places in the}} {{watershed}} where plants and animals can thrive. In a report published in 2005, the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (BES), using data from an early General Land Office survey, compared the watershed of 1851 with that of 2003. The study showed {{that all of the}} watershed provided plant and wildlife habitat in 1851, but by 2003 only 33percent provided habitat. In 1851, water covered 10percent of the watershed but that had <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> by 2003. Marshes and other wetlands that had comprised 22percent of the earlier watershed dwindled to 1percent by 2003, while the percentage of land devoted to industry, commerce, and homes rose from 0 to 34. In addition, habitat remaining in 2003 was greatly disturbed, dominated by Himalayan blackberry and other invasive species and fragmented by roads. The riparian zone along the slough was generally narrow or nonexistent and devoid of trees and shrubs in places, including along the levees.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{approval}} of Gardasil in 2006 and despite low vaccine uptake, prevalence of HPV among teenagers aged 14–19 has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> with an 88% reduction among vaccinated women. No decline in prevalence was observed in other age groups, indicating the vaccine to {{have been responsible for}} the sharp decline in cases. The drop in number of infections is expected to in turn lead to a decline in cervical and other HPV-related cancers in the future.|$|E
25|$|In late 2002, {{the trust}} located the No 2 end of RM 121 in a quarry at Kerikeri. Although {{the car was}} in a {{weathered}} condition and had <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> at some point, it was still relatively complete despite missing the seats, bogies (removed in the late 1970s at Otahuhu Workshops), and its diesel engines. This car was later purchased to become the replacement for the damaged half of RM 133, and moved to Pahiatua where restoration work began.|$|E

25|$|Group Q5-2 {{features}} a large block of cut limestone {{that may have}} functioned as the base for a stela. The group is also notable for a small cave underneath the principal structure. Near the cave entrance was found a large shell that had <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> lengthwise in order {{to serve as a}} scribe's inkwell, as illustrated in Maya art. Because of this inkwell, the excavators have interpreted this group as the residence of a scribe. The group has been dated to the Late Classic.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Route 4 {{service to}} Ft. Howard, which had <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> {{less than a}} year earlier, was {{eliminated}} completely, and service the remaining parts of the line was reduced to one bus every 70 minutes. The proposal to eliminate service to Ft. Howard drew protests that were filmed by local news stations. A private contractor was chartered to provide this service following elimination. In 1997, MTA once again started to run a bus to Ft. Howard. A new Route 6 that ran from Eastpoint Mall to Ft. Howard, mostly via North Point Road, was briefly added in 1997, but was discontinued a year later.|$|E
25|$|After the {{withdrawal}} of the Ottoman army the Italians could easily extend their occupation of the country, seizing East Tripolitania, Ghadames, the Djebel and Fezzan with Murzuk during 1913. The outbreak of the First World War with the necessity to bring back the troops to Italy, the proclamation of the Jihad by the Ottomans and the uprising of the Libyans in Tripolitania forced the Italians to abandon all occupied territory and to entrench themselves in Tripoli, Derna, and on the coast of Cyrenaica. The Italian control over much of the interior of Libya remained ineffective until the late 1920s, when forces under the Generals Pietro Badoglio and Rodolfo Graziani waged bloody pacification campaigns. Resistance petered out only after the execution of the rebel leader Omar Mukhtar on September 15, 1931. The result of the Italian colonisation for the Libyan population was that by the mid-1930s it had <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> due to emigration, famine, and war casualties. The Libyan population in 1950 was at the same level as in 1911, approximately 1.5 million.|$|E

25|$|State Delegation Each {{delegation}} {{are made}} up of up to three kinds of delegates. Party members, delegates from the congressional districts and delegates from the state at-large. They can either be bound, meaning that they are legally or morally bound to vote for a candidate for at least the first ballot at the National Convention, or they can be unbound, meaning that they are free to vote for any candidate at the National Convention. Some delegates are only morally bound, meaning that they are allocated to a candidate or elected on his ticket but are not legally bound to vote for him. Some delegates are unbound but are elected at their local conventions because they are strong supporters of a candidate. This means that the binding status of a delegate only become of importance if no candidate have reached a majority of delegates before the National Convention. If a candidate suspends his campaign the delegates allocated and/or elected to him may become unbound depending on state rules. Five delegations (#) have been penalized for breaking RNC election guidelines, meaning that their number of delegates have <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> and their party leaders have been banned from voting. Ten delegations (†) have chosen to bind their party leaders to the result of the allocating event instead of leaving them unbound.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the support}} and {{interest}} in traditional Mexican ceramics, the number of artisans is dropping. In 1994, there were just over 1.5 million ceramic artisans in the country, which dropped to 50,000 by 2006. This made craftsmen almost non-existent in some states. Majolica is no longer being produced in Aguascalientes {{and the number of}} workshops in Guanajuato state has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> in recent years. [...] In major cities such as Mexico City and Monterrey, there is only a handful. One {{reason for this is that}} many craft products are being replaced by cheaper pewter and plastic wares. Another reason is that many from craft producing areas have left to work in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Across {{the county}} line, NY238 cuts across the southwestern {{corner of the}} town of Alexander on its way into the town of Darien. It closely follows the Norfolk Southern Railway's Southern Tier Line through this mostly rural area, and CR45 follows a {{parallel}} routing to NY238 {{on the opposite side of}} the tracks through much of the area. CR45 leaves NY238 just outside Attica, and rejoins the state route about [...] later in Darien. As a result, one road which used to cross the tracks in this area—CR36—has <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half,</b> eliminating the requirement to maintain its grade crossing. After CR45's western terminus, NY238 turns more northward again, entering a residential area and terminating at a junction with US20 in the hamlet of Darien.|$|E

2500|$|Over 9% of Havana's {{population}} live in cuartería (solares, ciudadela), 3.3% in shanty towns, and 0.3% {{in refugee}} shelters. This {{does not include}} {{an estimate of the}} number of people living in housing in [...] "fair" [...] or [...] "poor" [...] condition because in many cases these units do not necessarily constitute slum housing but rather are basically sound dwellings needing repairs. According to Instituto Nacional de Vivienda (National Housing Institute) official figures, in 2001, 64% of Havana's 586,768 units were considered in [...] "good" [...] condition, up from 50% in 1990. Some 20% were in [...] "fair" [...] condition and 16% in [...] "poor" [...] condition. Partial or total building collapses are not uncommon, although the number had <b>been</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> <b>half</b> {{by the end of the}} 1990s as the worst units disappeared and others were repaired. Buildings in Old Havana and Centro Habana are especially exposed to the elements: high humidity, the corrosive effects of salt spray from proximity to the coast, and occasional flooding.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{a report}} by the DNCG, it was {{determined}} that the combined budget of Ligue 1 clubs was €910million for the 2005–06 season, a 39% increase from the 2002–03 season. The prominent reason for the rise was mainly associated with the television rights deal the league regularly signs. Excluding Paris Saint-Germain, many of the top division clubs are extremely healthy with clubs such as Auxerre, Bordeaux, Lille, and Lyon being referred to as [...] "managed to perfection". However, recently the DNCG has encouraged clubs to concentrate on limiting their [...] "skyrocketing wage bills and the magnitude of their debts" [...] after it was discovered that the LFP clubs accounts as a whole were in the red for the third consecutive season (2008–2011) with an estimated deficit of €130million.
