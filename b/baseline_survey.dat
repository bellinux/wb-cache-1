40|$|As stipulated in the {{independent}} evaluation contract, CIE will implement <b>baseline</b> <b>surveys</b> at households, facilities (schools, health clinics), and communities using national randomly-selected samples in all three countries. These will be followed up in 2012 with a targeted micro-survey and then with full national-level random administrations in late 2013 or early 2014. The rationale for the <b>baseline</b> <b>surveys</b> and the subsequent full follow-up survey administrations is to measure change along key variables over time. The rationale for the mid-term micro-survey is to measure targeted change, using the full baseline study (including case studies) as a guide. Given the key evaluation questions to be addressed, the <b>baseline</b> <b>surveys</b> need to establish 1) citizens’ knowledge about government provision of the basic services of education, health, water; 2) baseline conditions in schools, health facilities, and communities (quality of service); 2) citizens’ access to and use of information channels and media; 4) self-perceptions and indicators of agency and action; and 5) test emerging and intriguing hypotheses. For each broad purpose, establishing what is known at this point enables assessments of change over time. Thus, the overall design of the evaluation calls for follow-up randomized national-level surveys in Year 5 to assess changes and to test the same and new hypotheses. Obviously, <b>baseline</b> <b>surveys</b> are designed to establish initial conditions against which effects or changes can be compared...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{promoting}} a sustainable National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in Ghana through improved client-centred quality care and effective community engagement in quality care assessment. The thesis comprises of two main parts. Part one reports on findings from <b>baseline</b> <b>surveys</b> conducted in 2012 among 324 health workers in 64 primary health {{facilities in the}} Greater Accra and Western regions of Ghana. Moreover, <b>baseline</b> household <b>surveys</b> were conducted in 1, 903 households in the two regions. <b>Baseline</b> <b>surveys</b> explored health worker motivation levels and associations with healthcare quality efforts, efficiency in health service delivery, and comparison of perceived and technical quality healthcare. Part two of the thesis comprises of impact evaluation studies conducted in 2014, after implementing community engagement interventions in 2013. The interventions were designed to promote a more client-centred healthcare and insurance services. Positive impact of the interventions was observed on clinic staff motivation levels, perceptions on the NHIS, and efforts toward patient safety and risk reduction. The thesis concludes that client and community engagement in healthcare quality improvement efforts could augment existing quality improvement strategies of the Ministry of Health and National Health Insurance Authority. This innovative approach will help increase trust in the NHIS and the healthcare system, needed to attain universal health coverage...|$|R
