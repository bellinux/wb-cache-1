Especially, the effects of substitutional boron atoms on the structure and properties of Cr 2 AlC have been discussed in detail for the first time. All of the compounds, including newly presented Cr 2 AlB are energetically and mechanically stable. From spin-polarized first-principles calculations, it is interestingly concluded that the ground states of Cr 2 AlX (X=C, N and B) compounds should have magnetic character, and this assertion is supported that the theoretical results obtained from spin-polarized calculations are in excellent agreement with the experiment. Furthermore, the bonding, partial and total magnetic characteristics are explored in detail, by means of partial and total spin density of states, Mulliken atomic charges and bond overlap populations, and 2 D electron density maps. Additionally, the elastic and mechanical properties are studied.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the focus}} is on {{studying}} BaZrO 3 -BaCeO 3 based proton conductors due to that they represent very promising proton conductors to be used for Intermediate Temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (ITSOFCs). Here, dense BaZr 0. 5 Ce 0. 3 Y 0. 2 O 3 -δ (BZCY 532) ceramics were selected as the major studied materials. These ceramics were prepared by different sintering methods and doping strategies. Based on achieved results, the thesis work can simply be divided into the following parts: 1) An improved synthesis method, which included a water-based milling procedure followed by a freeze-drying post-processing, was presented. A lowered calcination and sintering temperature for a Hf 0. 7 Y 0. 3 O 2 -δ (YSH) compound was achieved. The value of the relative density in this work was higher than previously reported data. It is also concluded that this improved method can be used for mass-production of ceramics. 2) As the solid-state reactive sintering (SSRS) represent a cost-effective sintering method, the sintering behaviors of proton conductors BaZrxCe 0. 8 -xLn 0. 2 O 3 -δ (x = 0. 8, 0. 5, 0. 1; Ln = Y, Sm, Gd, Dy) during the SSRS process were investigated. According to the obtained results, {{it was found that the}} sintering temperature will decrease, when the Ce content increases from 0 (BZCLn 802) to 0. 3 (BZCLn 532) and 0. 7 (BZCLn 172). Moreover, the radii of the dopant ions similar to the radii of Zr 4 + or Ce 4 + ions show a better sinterability. This means that it is possible to obtain dense ceramics at a lower temperature. Moreover, the conductivities of dense BZCLn 532 ceramics were determined. The conductivity data indicate that dense BZCY 532 ceramics are good candidates as either oxygen ion conductors or proton conductors used for ITSOFCs. 3) The effect of NiO on the sintering behaviors, morphologies and conductivities of BZCY 532 based electrolytes were systematically investigated. According to the achieved results, it can be concluded that the dense BZCY 532 <b>B</b> <b>ceramics</b> (NiO was added during ball-milling before a powder mixture calcination) show an enhanced oxygen and proton conductivity. Also, that BZCY 532 A (NiO was added after a powder mixture calcination) and BZCY 532 N (No NiO was added in the whole preparation procedures) showed lower values. In addition, dense BZCY 532 B and BZCY 532 N ceramics showed only small electronic conductivities, when the testing temperature was lower than 800 ℃. However, the BZCY 532 A ceramics revealed an obvious electronic conduction, when they were tested in the range of 600 ℃ to 800 ℃. Therefore, it is preferable to add the NiO powder during the BZCY 532 powder preparation, which can lower the sintering temperature and also increase the conductivity. 4) Dense BZCY 532 ceramics were successfully prepared by using the Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) method at a temperature of 1350 ℃ with a holding time of 5 min. It was found that a lower sintering temperature ( 200 ℃/min) are two key parameters to prepare dense BZCY 532 ceramics. These results confirm that the SPS technique represents a feasible and cost-effective sintering method to prepare dense Ce-containing BaZrO 3 -BaCeO 3 based proton conductors. 5) Finally, a preliminary study for preparation of Ce 0. 8 Sm 0. 2 O 2 -δ (SDC) and BZCY 532 basedcomposite electrolytes was carried out. The novel SDC-BZCY 532 based composite electrolytes were prepared by using the powder mixing and co-sintering method. The sintering behaviors, morphologies and ionic conductivities of the composite electrolytes were investigated. The obtained results show that the composite electrolyte with a composition of 60 SDC- 40 BZCY 532 has the highest conductivity. In contrast, the composite electrolyte with a composition of 40 SDC- 60 BZCY 532 shows the lowest conductivity. In summary, the results show that BaZrO 3 -BaCeO 3 based proton-conducting ceramic materials represent very promising materials for future ITSOFCs electrolyte applications. QC 20150423 </p...|$|E

The focus was on correlating outdoor exposure corrosion behavior from a variety of microclimates with a series of accelerated laboratory corrosion tests for both galvanic and non-galvanic ceramic-aluminum (Al) couples. Electrolytes with varying amounts of chloride contents (0, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and 20000 ppm chlorides) were used in the accelerated tests to improve correlation with field results. In addition, the outdoor exposure test data were used to adjust the duration of the accelerated corrosion tests so that the corrosion damage accumulated in the accelerated tests could better represent the corrosion damage accumulated in the field.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{technology}} of twenty-six complete vessels from the ceramic assemblages of K 2 and Mapungubwe in the Limpopo Province of South Africa, from the early second millennium (AD 1000 - AD 1300). Mapungubwe is a significant pre-colonial archaeological site {{of social and political}} complexity, which lead to the emergence of one of the first known states in southern Africa. Ceramics are commonly associated with these nationally significant sites and have served mainly as chronological and regional markers to determine the cultural sequence of the Shashe Limpopo Confluence Area. Previous studies on these ceramics have paid little consideration to ceramic technology, as research for decades has focused largely on stylistic typologies. Non-invasive methods, compositional materials analysis, and macroscopic analysis provide a broad technological characterization of physical evidence left by the potter on the complete vessels, and are used to interpret aspects of the chaîne opératoire or sequence of ceramic manufacture. Though primary traces of forming and shaping techniques have often been erased by secondary forming processes such as smoothing, scraping, wiping and finishing, the fundamental technology of the vessels can nevertheless be elucidated based on a range of technical variables. This study is {{the first of its kind}} in South African archaeology, where complete vessels from a valuable research assemblage are used as a basis for understanding ceramic technology. The results enhance archaeological views of Iron Age ceramic technology, which are pertinent to the interpretation of how the ceramics were manufactured and contributes to a wider understanding of social and technical choices made by potters and related social implications. Vessels from the K 2 and Mapungubwe ceramic repertoire serve to answer questions about ceramic research that relate to (a) characterization of complete archaeological <b>ceramics,</b> (<b>b)</b> evidence of technology (c) compositional data of the vessels (d) to provide anatomical data on the technological and morphological attributes of ceramic manufacture. The preliminary results point to evidence of local manufacture of K 2 and Mapungubwe ceramics by means of the analysis of four steps in the chaîne opératoire: fabric, forming, firing and finishing. Tentative conclusions further demonstrate technological continuity and variability of raw materials for ceramic manufacture at K 2 and Mapungubwe. The broader archaeological perspective, which emerges is one of an expanding technological society, changing technical commonalities, forms and decorative styles, and in the process, making if only subtle technological choices in the manufacture process of early second millennium AD Iron Age ceramics.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of the ceramic analysis of a sample of ceramics from the site of Cahal Pech, Belize, in an attempt to study the transition between the Cunil Ceramic complex and the Early Facet Jenney Creek/ Kanluk ceramic complex. The Cunil ceramics (1100 - 900 B. C.) are the earliest known ceramic complex discovered at Cahal Pech. This complex is immediately followed by the Early Facet Jenney Creek/Kanluk ceramic complex (c. a. 900 - 600 <b>B.</b> C.). Cunil <b>ceramics</b> served as mediums to display motifs considered to be Olmec-style or following a panMesoamerican style (Brown 2007; Awe 1992; Cheetham 1998). These motifs held symbolic and ideological meaning, and the ceramics bearing these decorations were meant to be displayed while serving food or drink (Brown 2007 : 9). The use of these pan-Mesoamerican concepts decreases significantly after the Cunil phase (Brown 2007 : 9,) at a time when social differentiation starts to emerge in the Maya Lowlands and it can first be identified in the archaeological record (Healy et al. 2004; Brown 2007). This decrease in the occurrence of Cunil symbols also coincides with the emergence of the Early Facet Jenney Creek/ Kanluk Complex. These ceramics differ from the Cunil ceramics in decoration, surface treatment, materials used for their manufacture, and form. The presence of Olmec style motifs in Cahal Pech, without a doubt, indicates that the people of this site were involved in some type of regional interaction. The emergence of the Olmec civilization towards 1250 B. C. marks the first known development of a large-scale chiefdom or state polity in Mesoamerica (Cheetham iii 1998). Archaeological excavations at San Lorenzo, the seat of the Olmec civilization, produced information pointing to the existence of sustained trade networks with other regions of Mesoamerica. Findings of Olmec style motifs and ceramics also lend support to theories claiming the existence of extensive networks of exchange and interaction within the Maya region. During the transition from Cunil to Jenney Creek/Kanluk, not only did the residents of Cahal Pech cease to use Olmec motifs on serving vessels, but also the ceramics used at Cahal Pech changed significantly. Some ceramic groups maintained some continuity, but new, previously unknown groups emerged. Transformation in the ceramics produced by the inhabitants of Cahal Pech can inform the social changes that occurred during the transition between these two ceramic complexes from Cahal Pech, Cunil and Early Facet Jenney Creek/Kanluk. The query this project pursues addresses the influence of internal means for change in ceramic production, and well as the effect that Cahal Pech's involvement in a regional network had on its ceramic assemblage. Some questions this project addresses when examining the ceramic sample presented include: What local factors {{may have contributed to the}} development of new ceramic groups? Did new ceramic decoration and production techniques did in effect develop at Cahal Pech, or were such innovations introduced from neighboring areas? How do changes in the ceramics of Cahal Pech reflect social changes? The possibility that foreign ceramics were introduced to the Belize Valley raises the question of where these materials came from and who was involved in regional and long distance interaction with Cahal Pech, since the wide distribution of Olmec style materials suggests that people sustained trade and exchange networks over iv considerable distances. After detailing the findings from analysis of the ceramic sample, I consider how this ceramic sample points to the combination of internal and external catalysts for change in the production reflects in this ceramic sample. Engaging these issues might help to determine the role that Cahal Pech played at a local level, and furthermore on a regional level. ...|$|R
