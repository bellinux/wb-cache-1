Others disagreed with such actions and proposed launching an additional attack on a popular government site. A spokesman for Electronic Frontiers Australia said he believed there was no real intention or capacity to follow through with any of the violent threats.|$|E
25|$|Similar to the Kagoshima Accent, {{the high}} tone is {{assigned}} to the very last mora in an unaccented unit. In an accented unit, the high tone falls on the penultimate mora and falls <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> last mora. Tone placement will also shift accordingly when morphemes and the such are appended to the unit.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} oft-studied aspects of the Kagoshima dialect is its {{prosodic}} system. With the exception of Tanegashima and Makurazaki City, the system {{is described as a}} two-pattern pitch accent in which phrasal units may be either unaccented or accented. In mainland Kagoshima, unaccented units will bear a low tonal pitch until the final syllable, at which point the pitch rises. In accented units, however, the pitch rises on the penultimate syllable, and then drops <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final syllable.|$|E

25|$|However {{an equally}} {{great number of}} people in Rotorua {{supported}} the railway proposal and consequently it became a hot political debate. By 1973 NZR started to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> proposal and stated that the scheme would only proceed if the people of Rotorua agreed upon where the marshaling yards would be located. This of course was never likely to occur and consequently the scheme fell though shortly after. This was the last time serious consideration was given for a railway to Taupo from Rotorua.|$|E
25|$|Riding {{a wave of}} {{approval}} during a dramatic economic recovery from a 2001-02 crisis, the Kirchners' FPV had prevailed enjoyed increasingly large majorities in Congress, reaching their peak following the 2007 general elections (with 153 Congressmen and 44 Senators, at the time). In March 2008, Kirchner introduced a new sliding-scale taxation system for agricultural exports, effectively raising levies on soybean exports from 35% to 44% {{at the time of}} the announcement. This led to a nationwide lockout by farming associations, starting on March 12, with the aim of forcing the government to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> new taxation scheme. They were joined on March 25 by thousands of pot-banging demonstrators massed around the Buenos Aires Obelisk and in front of the presidential palace.|$|E
500|$|Britain's stance towards Rhodesia was {{influenced}} {{in a similar}} way, with Whitehall unable to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> policy of no independence before majority rule without causing international uproar. Also contributory was the disproportionate sway over Britain's African policy held by Julius Nyerere, the President of Tanzania, who was a fervent proponent for majority rule across Africa without delay, implemented by military force if need be. British politicians deferred to Nyerere on almost every proposal they made regarding Rhodesia during the 1960s and 1970s. In the immediate post-Federal period, Britain forlornly tried to stifle Rhodesia's further alignment with South Africa and Portugal, realising that British influence in the region was severely limited while the three remained so closely linked. A 1965 British government memorandum described the trio as [...] "a defiant and mutually sustaining bloc".|$|E

500|$|Gardiner {{joined the}} Chicago Black Hawks in the 1927–28 season. In {{his first season}} with the Black Hawks, Gardiner played in 40 out of 44 of Chicago's games. Posting a 2.83goals average, Gardiner won or tied only eight games, with three of those games being shutouts. The {{following}} season, Gardiner appeared in all of 44 of Chicago's games. Known as the NHL's [...] "goalless wonders", Chicago scored only 33goals the entire season, finishing with a 7–29–8 record. Gardiner posted five shutouts and a 1.85 goals against average that season. During {{a game against the}} New York Rangers on February 3, 1929 WJ Holmes, manager of the Maroons came to Chicago to watch Gardiner play. The Rangers won the game 3–2 though Gardiner played well. Even so, Frederic McLaughlin, owner of the Hawks, offered to sell him back to Winnipeg for $3500. Only after Barney Stanley and Hugh Lehman talked to McLaughlin did he <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> deal. After being booed by the Chicago fans, Gardiner nearly retired, before being talked out of it by Duke Keats.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "You and I" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a slow tempo of 60 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major. During the song Gaga's voice spans from the notes of E3 to C5. The song begins with an A–G–A chord progression, which changes to A–Bm/A–D/A–Bm during the chorus, {{and back to the}} former chords afterwards. The opening lyrics—"It's {{been a long time since}} I came around/ It's been a long time, but I'm back in town/ And this time, I'm not leaving without you"—describe a whiskey-breathed lover for whom she is pining. Gil Kaufman of MTV News described it as the [...] "tune eschewed most of her dance flavor, right down to a rollicking barrel-house piano solo." [...] Her voice sounded like growling during the main verses, where she sings the lines: [...] "He said, 'Sit back down where you belong, in the corner of my bar with your high heels on, Sit <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> couch where we made love the first time..." [...] Noting the differences between live performances of the song and the studio version, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph observed that the piano parts were replaced mostly by [...] "fizzing synths, a stomping beat sampled from [...] "We Will Rock You", thundering electric guitars and backing vocals stacked into shimmering choral walls." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian described the song as an [...] "umlaut-toting digital country power ballad" [...] with two Bruce Springsteen references: [...] "born to run" [...] and Nebraska.|$|E

Use of this provision by agencies other than Department of Defense is rare.
