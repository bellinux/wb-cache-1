The GCM domain as a new class of Zn-containing DNA-binding domain with no similarity to any other DNA-binding domain. The GCM domain consists of a large and a small domain tethered together by one of the two Zn ions present in the structure. The large and the small domains comprise five- and three-stranded beta-sheets, respectively, with three small helical segments packed against the same side of the two beta-sheets.

There is also an extended tail of eight amino acid residues at the N terminus that does not participate in beta-sheet formation.

50|$|The formiminotransferase (FT) {{domain of}} formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase (FTCD) forms a homodimer, with each protomer {{comprising}} two subdomains. The formiminotransferase domain has an N-terminal subdomain {{that is made}} up of a six-stranded mixed <b>beta-pleated</b> <b>sheet</b> and five alpha helices, which are arranged on the external surface of the beta sheet. This, in turn, faces the beta-sheet of the C-terminal subdomain to form a double beta-sheet layer. The two subdomains are separated by a short linker sequence, which is not thought to be any more flexible than the remainder of the molecule. The substrate is predicted to form a number of contacts with residues found in both the N-terminal and C-terminal subdomains. In humans, deficiency of this enzyme results in a disease phenotype.|$|E

50|$|In humans, BCATs are homo-dimers {{composed}} of two domains, a small subunit (residues 1-170) and a large subunit (residues 182-365). These subunits are connected by a short, looping connecting region (residues 171-181). Both subunits consist of four alpha-helices and a <b>beta-pleated</b> <b>sheet.</b> Structural studies of human branched-chain aminotransferases (hBCAT) revealed that the peptide bonds in both isoforms are all trans except for the bond between residues Gly338-Pro339. The active site of the enzyme lies in the interface between the two domains. Like other transaminase enzymes (as well as many enzymes of other classes), BCATs require the cofactor pyridoxal-5'-phosphate(PLP) for activity. PLP {{has been found to}} change the conformation of aminotransferase enzymes, locking the conformation of the enzyme via a Schiff base (imine) linkage in a reaction between a lysine residue of the enzyme and the carbonyl group of the cofactor. This conformational change allows the substrates to bind to the active site pocket of the enzymes.|$|E
50|$|Diseases of {{abnormal}} polymerization are said the undergo “replication”, or rather {{that the number}} of proteins that are polymerized is shown to generally increase much like in a natural course of infection. Since the functional “pathogens” of DAPs are protein units the diseases are almost entirely independent from the use of nucleic acids. Multiple models illustrating this recruitment function exist, including the PrP protein in prion disease. The PrP protein is the major agent in spongiform encephalopathies and undergoes a clear process of polymerization based upon the natural balancing of thermodynamic states and kinetic summation. Like most proteins PrP can exist in two forms, one major and one minor, an alpha helix structure and a <b>beta-pleated</b> <b>sheet</b> structure respectively, that are balanced during nearly all conditions, but with dominance granted to the stable helix form. In certain instances, it may be possible for two beta forms to contact each other at the same time, and in this case the pair can form bonds that successfully stabilize the beta forms thermodynamically and allowing these structures to remain. This is termed the “seed” of polymerization as from this point the continued interaction, or recruitment, amongst the beta forms is increased perpetually, since there is a constant presence of stable beta forms, as well as the fact that beta forms, or beta-pleated sheets, have a greater number of reactive nucleation sites. This progression forms extended fibrils slowly over time that will then cause localized cytopathology, resulting in the characteristic sites of cell degradation or “sponginess”. This general template of recruitment is also characteristic in the condition sickle cell anemia in which the red blood cells are misshapen because of the formation of extended polymer fibrils.|$|E

Here, phylogenetic analysis of 39 human DRB 1 alleles and 21 DRB 1 alleles obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification from a set of closely related primates reveals that sequences encoding the <b>beta-pleated</b> <b>sheet</b> and those encoding the alpha-helix of the second domain have different evolutionary histories. The polymorphisms in the <b>beta-pleated</b> <b>sheet</b> have been conserved between species and appear to reflect the ancestral relationships among haplotypes, whereas polymorphic segments encoding the alpha-helical domain {{appear to have been}} inserted by interallelic sequence exchange into the framework of different ancestral DRB 1 sequences.

50|$|The {{property}} of most biological importance of alpha-keratin is its structural stability.

Under high tension, alpha-keratin can even change into beta-keratin, a stronger keratin formation that has a secondary structure of <b>beta-pleated</b> <b>sheets.</b> Alpha-keratin tissues also shows signs of viscoelasticity, allowing it to both be able to stretch and absorb impact to a degree, though they are not impervious to fracture. Alpha-keratin strength is also affected by water content in the intermediate filament matrix; higher water content decreases the strength and stiffness of the keratin cell due to their effect on the various hydrogen bonds in the alpha-keratin network.|$|R

30|$|Amyloidosis {{comprises}} {{a diverse}} group of metabolic disorders characterised by extracellular deposition of insoluble proteins consisting of <b>beta-pleated</b> <b>sheets.</b> Clinically, amyloidosis can be classified as either systemic or localised [27]. Systemic forms of amyloidosis include primary amyloidosis, secondary amyloidosis and familial amyloidosis. Primary amyloidosis occurs in the absence of pre-existing disease, with the exception of dyscrasias (e.g. multiple myeloma and Waldenström macroglobulinemia). Secondary amyloidosis, which is the more common form, results from a number of conditions, such as chronic renal failure, chronic infection and neoplasia. Localised forms are characterised by local production of fibrillar proteins (usually amyloid light chain [AL] type), which can be deposited in nearly any organ. Familial amyloidosis typically presents as sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy in the second or third decade of life [28]. The kidneys and heart can also be involved. In familial cardiac amyloidosis, the amyloid fibrils consist of prealbumin, a mutant of transthyretin.|$|R
