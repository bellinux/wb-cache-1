5|$|Although Georgia has no {{significant}} oil or gas reserves, its territory hosts {{part of the}} <b>Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan</b> <b>pipeline</b> supplying Europe. Russia, Iran and the Persian Gulf countries were against {{the construction of the}} pipeline. The pipeline circumvents both Russia and Iran. Because it has decreased Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil, the pipeline has been {{a major factor in the}} United States' support for Georgia.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} pipeline transport – {{responsible for a}} high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation – is often undermined by the general public {{due to the lack of}} visibility of this mode. Generally held to be safer and more economical and reliable than the other modes of transport, this mode has many advantages over rival modes, such as trucks and railways. Examples of modern pipeline transport include Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline. International pipeline transport projects, like the <b>Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan</b> <b>pipeline,</b> presently connect modern nation states– in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey– through pipeline networks.|$|E
5|$|The {{independence}} of the Turkic states of the Soviet Union in 1991, with which Turkey shares a common cultural and linguistic heritage, allowed Turkey to extend its economic and political relations deep into Central Asia, thus enabling {{the completion of a}} multi-billion-dollar oil and natural gas pipeline from Baku in Azerbaijan to the port of Ceyhan in Turkey. The <b>Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan</b> <b>pipeline</b> forms part of Turkey's foreign policy strategy to become an energy conduit from the Caspian Sea basin to Europe. However, in 1993, Turkey sealed its land border with Armenia in a gesture of support to Azerbaijan (a Turkic state in the Caucasus region) during the Nagorno-Karabakh War, and it remains closed.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1992, the Turkish Prime Minister Süleyman Demirel {{proposed}} to Central Asian countries including Azerbaijan that the pipeline run through Turkey.

[...] The Turkish route meant a pipeline from Azerbaijan would run through Georgia or Armenia, but the route through Armenia was politically impossible due to the unresolved war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. This left the circuitous Azerbaijan-Georgia-Turkey route, longer and more expensive to build than the other option.|$|E
