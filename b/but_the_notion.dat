5|$|For Washington is a 1911 American silent short {{historical}} fiction drama film {{produced by the}} Thanhouser Company. The film is a fictional account of how a patriotic maid's home is taken over by Hessian officers in the American Revolutionary War. She hides her hatred of them and plies them with drink before delivering a message to George Washington. She leads them in crossing of the Delaware River and the historic capture. The film's crossing scene was inspired by Emmanuel Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware. The film was praised by critics, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> that the film was purely a {{historical fiction}} was lost on some. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

Of particular interest is the set of factors that has sustained complex, multicellular animals in addition to simpler organisms on Earth. Research and theory {{in this regard is}} a component of planetary science and the emerging discipline of astrobiology.|$|E
500|$|Since the 15th century, southeastern England {{varieties}} centred around London, {{which has}} been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects. In London, the Cockney dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes, and it was long a socially stigmatised variety. The spread of Cockney features across the south-east led the media to talk of Estuary English as a new dialect, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> was criticised by many linguists on the grounds that London had influencing neighbouring regions throughout history. Traits that have spread from London in recent decades include the use of intrusive R (drawing is pronounced drawring [...] ), t-glottalisation (Potter is pronounced with a glottal stop as Po'er [...] ), and the pronunciation of th- as [...] (thanks pronounced fanks) or [...] (bother pronounced bover).|$|E

500|$|The term orthogenesis was {{introduced}} by Wilhelm Haacke in 1893 and popularized by Theodor Eimer five years later. Proponents of orthogenesis had rejected the theory of natural selection as the organizing mechanism in evolution for a rectilinear model of directed evolution. With {{the emergence of the}} modern synthesis, in which genetics was integrated with evolution, orthogenesis and other alternatives to Darwinism were largely abandoned by biologists, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> that evolution represents progress is still widely shared. The evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr made the term effectively taboo in the journal Nature in 1948, by stating that it implied [...] "some supernatural force". The American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson (1953) attacked orthogenesis, linking it with vitalism by describing it as [...] "the mysterious inner force". Modern supporters include E. O. Wilson and Simon Conway Morris, while museum displays and textbook illustrations continue to give the impression of progress in evolution.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Beck {{released}} the single [...] "Timebomb", which {{was nominated for}} a Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. For his next studio effort, his tenth, Beck tapped Danger Mouse to produce, and the two first met in December 2007 to record. The duo knocked out two tracks in two days, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> that the album would be finished in a timely fashion soon evaporated. Beck had known Danger Mouse casually before, as many of his former musicians ended up working with Danger Mouse's side project, Gnarls Barkley. Still, the musicians were surprised at how well they got along. Following the grueling recording schedule, Beck was exhausted, calling it [...] "the most intense work I've ever done on anything", relating that he [...] "did at least 10 weeks with no days off, until four or five in the morning every night." [...] Beck's original vision was a short 10-track burst with two-minute songs, but the songs gradually grew as he fit 'two years of songwriting into two and a half months." [...] Modern Guilt (2008) was [...] "full of off-kilter rhythms and left-field breakdowns, with an overall 1960s vibe." ...|$|E
500|$|Barton is a {{prominent}} user of Twitter, with over three million followers as of October 2016. Commenting on figures from Friedrich Nietzsche and George Orwell to Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Morrissey, his eclectic tweets {{have resulted in}} him being described by the BBC as [...] "a philosophical sportsman to rival Eric Cantona in his heyday". Others in the media have criticised this description, with Paul Hayward, chief sports writer for The Daily Telegraph, writing that Barton [...] "manages to be patronised [...] and held up {{as some kind of}} exemplar all at once... he is skilled at tricking us into watching him veer between the extremes of thinker and thug. Either this is a repudiation of societal hypocrisy or, more likely, indicative of a sociopathic tendency." [...] Ellie Mae O'Hagan of The Guardian commented that [...] "the problem, I think, is not the belief that Barton is a reformed character, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> that one cannot possibly be a philosopher and violent at the same time: that quoting philosophy should automatically be taken as a sign of reformation... In my mind, this all boils down to class snobbery. It is automatically assumed that Barton has violent tendencies because he's a working-class man who has chosen to play football for a living. So when he shows signs of intelligence, it's treated as a sign of reform: intellect is the preserve of the gentlemanly middle-classes." ...|$|E

2500|$|In mathematics, {{the limit}} {{inferior}} and limit superior of a sequence {{can be thought}} of as limiting (i.e., eventual and extreme) bounds on the sequence. They {{can be thought of}} in a similar fashion for a function (see limit of a function). For a set, they are the infimum and supremum of the set's limit points, respectively. In general, when there are multiple objects around which a sequence, function, or set accumulates, the inferior and superior limits extract the smallest and largest of them; the type of object and the measure of size is context-dependent, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of extreme limits is invariant.|$|E

All the evidence shows there's no evidence at all for a rise of a new anti-Semitism, whether in Europe or in North America. The evidence is zero. And, in fact, there's a new book put out by an Israel stalwart. His name is Walter Laqueur, a very prominent scholar. It's called The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism. It just came out, 2006, from Oxford University Press. He looks at the evidence, and he says no. There's some in Europe among the Muslim community, there's some anti-Semitism, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> that in the heart of European society or North American society there's anti-Semitism is preposterous. And in fact — or no, a significant rise in anti-Semitism is preposterous." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Democrats facing {{possible}} large {{losses in}} the 2010 midterm elections and President Obama struggling in opinion polls, idle speculation in Washington media circles concerning Obama's chances in the 2012 presidential election led {{to the notion that}} Clinton would take over as Obama's vice-presidential running mate in 2012 to add to his electoral appeal. Some versions of this idea had Vice President Biden replacing her as Secretary of State if Obama won. That it would ever happen was unlikely, but did not stop the chatter; when the job swap idea was mentioned in public to Clinton, she smiled and shook her head. A couple of months later, Obama shot down the idea, saying the notion was [...] "completely unfounded" [...] and that [...] "they are both doing outstanding jobs where they are." [...] (In late 2011, however, with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley did conduct some research into the idea of Clinton replacing Biden, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Why Houtman {{named the}} islands using a Portuguese word remains {{a subject of}} debate. John Forsyth states that the islands are named after the Abrolhos Archipelago off {{the east coast of}} Brazil, which was {{discovered}} and named by Portuguese navigators early in the 16th century. This position is supported by the fact that Houtman was familiar with the Abrolhos Archipelago, having sailed through it in 1598. Others assert that abrolhos was a Portuguese lookout's cry which, like many other Portuguese maritime terms, was taken up by sailors of other nationalities, becoming by Houtman's time a Dutch loan word for offshore reefs. Finally, it has been argued by proponents of the theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia that the Portuguese name is evidence that the islands were charted by Portuguese navigators in the 16th century. Kenneth McIntyre, for example, claimed that Houtman was in possession of Portuguese maps of the west coast of Australia, and that he named the islands [...] "abrolhos" [...] in accordance with the name on his map. Charting of the islands was previously credited to Jorge de Menezes, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> that Menezes visited Australia is now thoroughly discredited, and no other candidate has been proffered.|$|E
2500|$|The {{existence}} {{and distribution of}} organ transplantation procedures in developing countries, while almost always beneficial to those receiving them, raise many ethical concerns. Both the source and method of obtaining the organ to transplant are major ethical issues to consider, {{as well as the}} notion of distributive justice. The World Health Organization argues that transplantations promote health, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> of [...] "transplantation tourism" [...] has the potential to violate human rights or exploit the poor, to have unintended health consequences, and to provide unequal access to services, all of which ultimately may cause harm. Regardless of the [...] "gift of life", in the context of developing countries, this might be coercive. The practice of coercion could be considered exploitative of the poor population, violating basic human rights according to Articles 3 and 4 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. There is also a powerful opposing view, that trade in organs, if properly and effectively regulated to ensure that the seller is fully informed of all the consequences of donation, is a mutually beneficial transaction between two consenting adults, and that prohibiting it would itself be a violation of Articles 3 and 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.|$|E
