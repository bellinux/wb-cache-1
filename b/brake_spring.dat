40|$|This paper {{proposed}} a method {{used to analyze}} the motion of hammer-driven type penetrators and built a testbed for validating the result of structure optimization of the penetrator in deep space exploration. This method gave a clear understanding of the working principle of the penetrator. The penetrator mainly comprises five components: hammer element, suppressor element, housing element, <b>brake</b> <b>spring,</b> and force spring. Based on the structure of the penetrator, the maximum forward movement of housing element was chosen as optimal object. In order to describe the working process clearly and properly, the working stroke was divided into three phases: unlocking phase, colliding phase, and penetrating phase. In each phase, the displacement and velocity of hammer element, suppressor element, and housing element were described with equation sets when numerically solved. Then, the corresponding parameters of the penetrator were obtained in the testbed with high-speed camera. At last, comparing the parameters obtained by theoretical analysis with that obtained by experiment test with high-speed camera, the perfect ratio of mass element (hammer element, suppressor element, and housing element) and perfect ratio of stiffness of spring element (<b>brake</b> <b>spring</b> and force spring) were obtained...|$|E

50|$|Steering was by cam and lever {{with the}} box {{mounted on the}} car's frame. From 1932 the brake vacuum servo motor was run from the car's gearbox. Brakes were on all four wheels and {{operated}} by rods, drums were enclosed. The front brakes used the Perrott principle. The central hand lever used the same brake shoes at the back as the foot <b>brake.</b> <b>Springs</b> were semi-elliptical and flat with gaiters and shock absorbers.

50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of drum brakes is their relative complexity. A person {{must have a}} general understanding of how drum brakes work and take simple steps to ensure the brakes are reassembled correctly when doing work on drum brakes. And, {{as a result of}} this increased complexity (compared to disc brakes), maintenance of drum brakes is generally more time-consuming. Also, the greater number of parts results in a greater number of failure modes compared to disc <b>brakes.</b> <b>Springs</b> can break from fatigue if not replaced along with worn brake shoes. And the drum and shoes can become damaged from scoring if various components (such as broken springs or self-adjusters) break and become loose inside the drum.|$|R
50|$|A <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> {{relay valve}} {{works on the}} same {{principle}} as the service brake relay valve, although it has the opposite effect. This type of relay valve responds to a major drop in pressure at its control-port by opening its exhaust port, which causes the air from each <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> chamber under its control to remotely exhaust, thus applying the <b>spring</b> <b>brakes</b> much-more-quickly than would otherwise be possible if the air were required to discharge via the yellow parking-control valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs is fed into the supply-port of the parking-control valve, {{as well as the}} supply-port of this relay valve; it is merged via yet another two-way check valve. The delivery-port output of the parking-control valve connects to the control-port of this relay valve; this enables the <b>spring</b> <b>brakes</b> to be controlled via this valve. The merged air from the parking-control valve prevents air-loss from only one braking circuit from causing the <b>spring</b> <b>brakes</b> to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location. However, with this increased control, comes increased responsibility {{on the part of the}} driver: If air is lost from the primary circuit alone, the <b>spring</b> <b>brakes</b> must be manually applied by the driver via the parking-control valve; otherwise, the front service brakes may not be enough to stop the vehicle safely in an emergency—especially if the vehicle is heavily loaded, and/or traveling at a high-speed. In fact, the driver's failure to manually apply the <b>spring</b> <b>brakes</b> in this situation could lead to catastrophic failure of the front brakes due to overheating, since it could cause the front service brakes to exceed their design-limit for energy absorption.QR1C air valve speeds up the process, with anti compounding, meaning trailer and service brakes will function 1 second between each other.The relay valve's function is analogous to the transistor used in electronic circuits.|$|R
50|$|Spring type - When no {{electricity}} {{is applied to}} the <b>brake,</b> a <b>spring</b> pushes against a pressure plate, squeezing the friction disk between the inner pressure plate and the outer cover plate.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in integrative studies of locomotion have revealed several general principles. Energy storage and exchange mechanisms discovered in walking and running bipeds apply to multilegged locomotion {{and even to}} flying and swimming. Nonpropulsive lateral forces can be sizable, but they may benefit stability, maneuverability, or other criteria that become apparent in natural environments. Locomotor control systems combine rapid mechanical preflexes with multimodal sensory feedback and feedforward commands. Muscles have a surprising variety of functions in locomotion, serving as motors, <b>brakes,</b> <b>springs,</b> and struts. Integrative approaches reveal not only how each component within a locomotor system operates but how they function as a collective whole. Locomotion, movement through the environment, is the behavior that most dictates the morphology and physiology of animals. Evolutionary pressures for efficient, rapid, adjustable...|$|R

50|$|Disc brakes rely on {{pliability}} of caliper {{seals and}} slight runout to release pads, leading to drag, fuel mileage loss, and disc scoring. Drum <b>brake</b> return <b>springs</b> give more positive action and, adjusted correctly, often have less drag when released. It is however possible to design special seals that retract the piston on a disc brake.|$|R
50|$|In trailers, {{this remote}} air-supply {{is in the}} form of a tank, which is charged {{whenever}} the emergency brakes are released via the red trailer-supply valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, this tank actually receives its air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs of the tractor; the air from both of these reservoirs is merged via a two-way check valve. The two-way check valve is a pneumatic device that has two inputs and one output; each input is connected to one these reservoirs. Only the air that is at the higher pressure is allowed to pass through to the check valve's output, which then passes through the tractor-protection valve, and then travels onward towards the trailer's air-tank and <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> valve via the red trailer-supply line (a.k.a., the emergency line); this releases the trailer's emergency <b>brakes</b> (a.k.a. <b>spring</b> <b>brakes).</b> The tractor-protection valve is a device that prevents air from being lost from the tractor's braking system in the event of the air-lines becoming separated or broken. The tractor's air-lines connect to the trailer's air-lines via metal connectors known as gladhands. The merged air from both reservoirs of the tractor prevents air-loss from only one tractor braking circuit from causing the trailer's <b>spring</b> <b>brakes</b> to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location, such as in the middle of an intersection.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 During locomotion, muscles {{respond to}} an animal's varying need for speed, endurance, strength, and agility. Therefore, in {{addition}} to operating as motors, muscles also act as <b>brakes,</b> <b>springs,</b> and struts. Interestingly, if the physical, morphological, and neurological parameters determining muscle performance vary regionally, a muscle may actually concurrently operate with multiple functions. In this study, I investigated the functional consequences of an intramuscular temperature gradient, arising from the inevitable heat exchange between metabolic heat production and surface cooling. In Chapter 1, I defined the determinants of muscle function and highlight the diverse roles muscles perform. I then discussed an emerging field, which shows that the factors determining muscle performance can regionally vary. In Chapter 2 (George and Daniel, 2011), I characterized the temperature gradient throughout a muscle in the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta. I recorded multi-site temperature measurements during tethered flight and conducted isometric contraction tests {{to determine the effect}} of temperature on contractile dynamics. We found that the significant temperature gradient throughout the muscle will cause the warm region to contract with rapid individual twitches, while the cooler region will contract in unfused tetany. In Chapter 3 (George et al., 2012), I determined how this temperature gradient affects regional mechanical power output. Work-loop methods, where muscle is cyclically lengthened and stimulated, allowed us to measure mechanical work. We found that the warm region of muscle will produce positive power, thereby functioning as a motor. As temperature decreases, power output decreases, transitioning to negative values. Thus, the cooler region of muscle may serve a completely separate role, including that of a <b>brake</b> and/or <b>spring.</b> In Chapter 4, I investigated if a temperature gradient additionally creates a locked-spring lattice, capable of storing and releasing energy, in the cool region of muscle. We used X-ray fiber diffraction to visualize the molecular dynamics of a contraction. A restrained lattice combined with reduced cross-bridge cycling in cool muscle indicates that cross-bridges are less able to detach from their binding sites. Thus, a temperature gradient likely forms a regional locked-spring lattice, whereby energy can be stored in the axial and radial extensions of cross-bridges...|$|R
25|$|The Roadmaster was {{introduced}} {{in a year when}} Buick's valve-in-head straight-eight engines were heavily revised. Buick reduced the number of engines from four sizes to two: a 233-cubic-inch, 93-horsepower job for the Special, and a big, 320.2-cubic inch, 120-horsepower engine for the other series. (To put the size and power of Buick’s larger straight-eight engine in context, compare it to the new 322-cubic-inch mono-block 120 horsepower V-8 that Cadillac introduced that year.) In addition to this major engineering change 1936 was also the year Buick adopted an all steel turret top and hydraulic <b>brakes.</b> Coil <b>springs</b> were in the front.|$|R

The leading shoe (closest to the front of the vehicle) is known as the primary shoe. The trailing shoe is known as the secondary shoe.
