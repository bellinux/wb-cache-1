Fellow cast member Jessica Forrest who plays Leanne Holiday opined that the character's style was the best style of any character from the show but [...] "back in the day... with the string vests and highlighted hair".

500|$|The Virginian, {{a seminal}} 1902 western novel by Owen Wister, took {{the side of}} the wealthy ranchers, {{creating}} a myth of the Johnson County War, but bore little resemblance to a factual account of the actual characters and events. Jack Schaefer's popular 1949 novel Shane treated themes associated with the Johnson County War and took {{the side of the}} settlers. The 1953 film The Redhead from Wyoming, starring Maureen O'Hara, dealt with similar themes; in one scene Maureen O'Hara's character is told, [...] "It won't <b>be</b> <b>long</b> <b>before</b> they're calling you Cattle Kate." [...] In the 1968 novel True Grit by Charles Portis, the main character, Rooster Cogburn, was involved in the Johnson County War. In the early 1890s Rooster had gone north to Wyoming where he was [...] "hired by stock owners to terrorize thieves and people called nesters and grangers...

500|$|At Indianapolis, Hogan led at the bat, and {{contemporary}} sources indicate his performance improved. [...] "Marty Hogan, who is playing temporarily in middle {{field for the}} Indianapolis team of the western league...is covering himself in glory with his superb playing", the Vindicator reported on June 4, 1895. [...] "The Indianapolis Sentinel of May 31st says: Hogan made a great record at the bat yesterday morning", the newspaper added. [...] "One of the drives was for a home run {{and three of the}} hits were bunts". [...] In addition, the article credited Hogan with four runs, five base hits, and two put outs in a late morning game against a rival team from St. Paul, Minnesota. [...] The Vindicator went on to quote the Indianapolis Journal as follows: [...] "Among the features of the forenoon game was Hogan's batting. [...] He got five hits, one a home run, and his bunting was even cleverer than usual, and that is saying a great deal". [...] The article concluded, [...] "If he keeps up this gait, it will not <b>be</b> <b>long</b> <b>before</b> [...] Von der Ahe reclaims his pet".|$|E
500|$|With {{the first}} play of the season imminent, the Horderns moved to Stratford and took {{temporary}} accommodation at Goldicote House, a large country property situated on the River Avon. The first of his two plays, The Tempest, caused Hordern to doubt his own acting ability when he compared his interpretation of Caliban to that of Alec Guinness, who had played the same role four years earlier. [...] Reassured by Byam Shaw, Hordern remained in the role for the entire run. A few days later, the actor was thrilled to receive a letter of appreciation from Michael Redgrave, who thought Hordern's Caliban was [...] "immensely fine, with all the pity and pathos... but with real terror and humour as well". More praise was received as the season continued; an anonymous theatre reviewer, quoted in Hordern's autobiography, called the actor's portrayal of Menenius Aggripa [...] "a dryly acute study of the 'humorous patrician' and one moreover that can move our compassion in the Volscian cameo", before going on to say [...] "we had felt that it would <b>be</b> <b>long</b> <b>before</b> Alec Guinness's Menenius could be matched. The fact that Michael Hordern's different reading can now stand beside the other does credit to a player who will be a Stratford prize." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1938, Imogen {{had visited}} Dartington Hall, a {{progressive}} school and crafts community near Totnes in Devon, {{which had been}} founded in 1925 by Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst. [...] In 1941–42, while travelling for CEMA in Devon and Cornwall, she was invited by the Elmhirsts to make her base at Dartington. In the summer of 1942, while recuperating there, she was persuaded by Christopher Martin, the centre's administrator, to resign her CEMA role and work at Dartington. He had in mind a music course, [...] "the {{sort of thing that}} your father did in the old days at Morley College". Beginning in 1943, Imogen established [...] a one-year [...] course, initially designed to train young women to organise amateur orchestras and musical events in rural communities. Gradually it developed into a more general musical education for a broader student intake. Under Imogen's leadership the course quickly became the hub of a range of musical activities, including the foundation of an amateur orchestra: [...] "Hardly any of us could play... However bad we were, we went on". Imogen's teaching methods, heavily based on [...] "learning by doing" [...] and without formal examinations, at first disconcerted her students and puzzled the school inspectors, but eventually gained acceptance and respect. Rosamond Strode, a pupil at Dartington who later worked with Imogen at Aldeburgh, said of her approach: [...] "She knew exactly how, and when, to push her victims in at the deep end, and she knew, also, that although they would flounder and splash about at first, it wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>long</b> <b>before...</b> they would be swimming easily while she beamed approval from the bank".|$|E

The album also drew comparisons to U2's anthemic qualities and was praised for its modern production.|$|E
