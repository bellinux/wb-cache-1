In November the regiment was selected {{to be part of the}} Allied force of occupation for the Dardanelles peninsula. They would again <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> a dismounted role, but only twenty-five officers and 464 other ranks were involved. Leaving Egypt on 28 November they disembarked on 5 December and moved into their camps at Maidos and Kilid Bahr. On 19 January 1919, the majority of the regiment returned to Egypt, rejoining the brigade at Kantara.|$|E

Dutch colonial policy tried to undermine Spanish and Portuguese hegemony. Spinola and the Spanish army were focused on the Netherlands, and the war seemed to <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> Spain's favor.|$|E
500|$|Senator Lodge died in November 1924, making Borah {{the senior}} member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and he took its {{chairman}}ship. [...] He could have become Judiciary Committee chairman instead, as the death of Frank Brandegee of Connecticut made Borah senior Republican on that committee as well. The Foreign Relations chairmanship greatly increased his influence, one quip was that the new Secretary of State, Frank B. Kellogg, created policy by ringing Borah's doorbell. Borah continued to oppose American interventions in Latin America, often splitting from the Republican majority over the matter. Borah was an avid horseback rider, and Coolidge is supposed to have commented after viewing him exercising in Rock Creek Park that it [...] "must bother the Senator to <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> the same direction as his horse." ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: {{to conduct}} {{researches}} of influence of classes of the sportswomen who <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> for bodybuilding and fitness-bikini on manifestation of physical qualities in different {{phases of the}} ovarian-menstrual cycle. Material & Methods: researches were conducted in sports fitness-clubs of Kharkov "Feromon", "Gorod", “King” with the qualified sportswomen who <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> for bodybuilding and fitness-bikini within 3 months of the preparatory period in number of 14 people. We used as methods of the research: the analysis of references and testing of level of motive qualities in separate phases of OMC. Results: the theoretical analysis of features of the accounting of phases of OMC at sportswomen is submitted and the testing {{of the level of}} development of physical qualities in different phases of the specific biological cycle at the qualified sportswomen, who <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> for bodybuilding, <b>is</b> held. Conclusions: the received results demonstrate that physical efficiency of the qualified sportswomen, who <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> for bodybuilding, <b>is</b> not identical in phases of the ovarian-menstrual cycle. It is revealed that the best conditions for performance of considerable exercise stresses in post-ovulatory and post-menstrual phases of OMC, therefore it is expedient to plan them in the preparatory periods of the qualified sportswomen, who <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> for bodybuilding...|$|R

However, {{the song was}} not released until it appeared as the B-side to [...] "Sussudio" [...] in the UK, and as the B-side to [...] "One More Night" [...] in the United States. Collins {{has said that he}} has [...] "no emotional attachment" [...] to the song. Music by The Jackson 5 inspired Collins to write the song [...] "I Like the Way", which also did not appear on the album, originally appearing as the B-side to [...] "One More Night" [...] in the UK and [...] "Sussudio" [...] in the US.

500|$|Descent 3 is {{the first}} project {{developed}} by Outrage Entertainment. The company was founded when Parallax Software, creators of previous Descent games, decided to split in two: Outrage Entertainment and Volition. Volition would focus on creating the combat space simulator FreeSpace games, while Outrage would continue with the Descent series. Development on Descent 3 began in November 1996 {{with a team of}} eight people. According to programmer Jason Leighton, one of the major problems during the game's development cycle was a lack of direction and control. He explained that the team had [...] "No code reviews, no art reviews, [...] no way of saying, 'This is bad and we should <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> a different direction'". This [...] "anarchistic" [...] development environment worked for Descent and Descent II because they were developed by small groups that worked closely together and often in the same room. However, as Outrage started to grow from eight people to almost 20 {{by the end of the}} project, the developers did not introduce enough management to control the process. As Leighton recalls, [...] "we literally had to build the team and company at the same time we started production on the game".|$|E
500|$|By late 1637, the {{conclusion}} of the controversy was beginning to take shape. [...] During the court held in early November, Wheelwright was finally sentenced to banishment, the delay caused by the hopes that he would, at some point, recant. [...] On 7 November the trial of Anne Hutchinson began, and Wilson was there with most of the other ministers in the colony, though his role was somewhat restrained. [...] During {{the second day of the}} trial, when things seemed to <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> her favor, Hutchinson insisted on making a statement, admitting that her knowledge of things had come from a divine inspiration, prophesying her deliverance from the proceedings, and announcing that a curse would befall the colony. [...] This was all that her judges needed to hear, and she was accused of heresy and sentenced to banishment, though she would be held in detention for four months, awaiting a trial by the clergy. [...] While no statements made by Wilson were recorded in either existing transcript of this trial, Wilson did make a speech against Hutchinson at the end of the proceedings, to which Hutchinson responded with anger four months later during her church trial.|$|E

Cornell then finds himself in contradiction {{over whether or not}} the [...] "spirit G", who allegedly communicates with him, is Dawkins's family member. Cornell next tries suggesting this spirit was in the military – again, typical of deceased relatives of people Dawkins’s age, but not of Dawkins. Cornell finishes with several explanations of why his powers might not always work, but Dawkins insists extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and then talks to the sceptical Derren Brown about cold reading, including misleading tricks it uses.|$|E
2500|$|The king opened {{sessions}} {{by raising}} questions or {{by giving the}} floor {{to one of the}} members. Each member added to the discussion in the ascending order of their rank. Discussions concluded with a vote of the council's opinion (in the same ascending order; the vote was called [...] "aller aux opinions"). In the end, the king made the final decision. Louis XIV very rarely went against the majority opinion of the council. Louis XV followed the same general rules but frequently interrupted discussion when it seemed to <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>in</b> a direction he disagreed with, rather than choose to go against the final opinion of the council. Meetings were typically longer than two hours and could go far longer.|$|E
