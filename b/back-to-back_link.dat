The measured power penalties for the bidirectional transmission are less than 0. 8 and 0. 2 dB compared to the <b>back-to-back</b> <b>link</b> and the unidirectional transmission system, respectively. We also practically evaluate {{the impact of the}} offset angles between the optical transmission path and the building windows. The result shows that the power penalty is as small as 0. 3 dB.

The reactor-capacitor device was elaborated. The installation develops the idea of controlled reactor alternating current link, and provides reactive power balance in the unit and needed value of the output voltage module. The basic characteristics of reactor-capacitor device for controlled power transmission were investigated. Analytical expressions for device elements parameters were derived. These ensure necessary ratio of voltages modules of linked power systems and reactive power balance of the device at circular output voltage vector rotation for a given load admittance. Obtained parameters ensure constant active power flow between linked asynchronously power systems and device reactive power internal balance...|$|E

50|$|India began {{utilizing}} grid management on {{a regional}} {{basis in the}} 1960s. Individual State grids were interconnected to form 5 regional grids covering mainland India. The grids were the Northern, Eastern, Western, North Eastern and Southern Grids. These regional links were established to enable transmission of surplus electricity between States in each region. In the 1990s, the Indian government began planning for a national grid. Regional grids were initially interconnected by asynchronous HVDC <b>back-to-back</b> <b>links</b> facilitating limited exchange of regulated power. The links were subsequently upgraded to high capacity synchronous links.|$|R

The two movements are played <b>back-to-back,</b> <b>linked</b> by a clarinet cadenza. The first movement is written in A-B-A form and is slow and expressive, full of bittersweet lyricism. The cadenza not only gives the soloist an opportunity to display his virtuosity, but also introduces many of the melodic Latin American jazz themes that dominate the second movement.|$|R

This interest comes from their power factor unity capability on the utility grid and to maintain regulated output parameters, thanks to the decoupling between the grid and the load side. In this paper, a 150 KVA prototype of DC <b>link</b> <b>back-to-back</b> converter for electrical resistance seam welding applications is described. The focus of the paper is on the control strategy developed to absorb constant power from the three-phase utility grid.

An estimation procedure of the load parameters is presented too. The effectiveness of this control scheme has been proved by simulations and tests...|$|R

Such an arrangement is known as mono-polar, point-to-point VSC-HVDC link. However, bipolar schemes are favored over the basic mono-polar link, on grounds of higher power throughputs and reliability [4].|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new concept, applicable to high-power current-sourced conversion (CSC), where a controllable firing-angle shift is introduced between series and parallel converters to enable independent active and reactive power control. The firing-shift concept solves a difficult problem, by giving thyristor based CSCs the control flexibility of pulse-width modulated (PWM) converters, {{but without a}} loss in efficiency or rating. Several configurations are developed, based on the firing-shift concept, and provide flexible, efficient solutions for both very high power HVDC transmission, and very high current industrial processes. HVDC transmission configurations are first developed for 4 -quadrant high-pulse operation, based on the series connected multi-level current reinjection (MLCR) topology. Independent reactive power control between two ends of an HVDC link are proven under firing-shift control, with high-pulse operation, and without on-load tap changing (OLTC) transformers. This is followed by application of firing-shift control to a bi-directional <b>back-to-back</b> HVDC <b>link</b> connecting two weak systems to highlight the added dc voltage control flexibility of the concept. The fault recovery capability of an MLCR based ultra-HVDC (UHVDC) long distance transmis...|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} of all amphiboles {{is based on}} a double chain of linked SiO4 tetrahedra, with composition (Si4O11)n. The inner tetrahedra are referred to as T1 and the outer ones as T2. The pattern in the double chain repeats after a block of two T1 and two T2 tetrahedra, with a repeat distance of approximately 5.3 Å, and this determines the length of the unit cell along the c crystal axis. The tetrahedra within a chain all point outwards in the same direction, and the chains are <b>linked</b> <b>back-to-back</b> by cations to form I-beams. The I-beams themselves are then linked together to form the complete structure.|$|R

Using a combination of leading zero and trailing zero guard intervals to eliminate inter-block interference, jointly optimal MMSE designs for the block processors in the relay layer and the destination are derived under the assumption of channel state information availability across most of the link. This proposed technique is compared to an extension of state-of-the-art block based methods, which are operated <b>back-to-back</b> across the <b>link</b> and may contain an intermittent non-linear detection stage in the relay.

40|$|Analog {{performance}} of an all-optical ultrafast wavelength converter is measured and {{reported for the}} first time. The wavelength-conversion process is based on nonlinear cross-phase modulation in an optical fiber combined with an optical filter to convert phase modulation to amplitude modulation. The spurious-free dynamic-range (SFDR) of the converter is measured to be 82 dB. Hz(2 / 3). We define a new metric called the SFDR power penalty, which measures the degradation in SFDR relative to baseline the <b>back-to-back</b> analog optical <b>link.</b> The SFDR power penalty {{was measured to be}} 5 dB. Hz(2 / 3) and is shown to be a function of the input optical power. This metric is used to characterize the linear region of the optical wavelength converter...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modeling {{and analysis of}} a voltage source converter (VSC) based <b>back-to-back</b> (BTB) HVDC <b>link.</b> The case study considers the response {{to changes in the}} active and reactive power and disturbance caused by single line to ground (SLG) fault. The controllers at each terminal are designed to inject a variable (magnitude and phase angle) sinusoidal, balanced set of voltages to regulate/control the active and reactive power. It is also possible to regulate the converter bus (AC) voltage by controlling the injected reactive power. The analysis is carried out using both d-q model (neglecting the harmonics in the output voltages of VSC) and three phase detailed model of VSC. While the eigenvalue analysis and controller design is based on the d-q model, the transient simulation considers both models...|$|R
30|$|A {{limitation}} of the LCC-HVDC technology {{is the need to}} reverse direct voltage polarity to enact a change in the power flow direction; this limits the ability of an LCC-HVDC system to respond quickly to changing demand or market conditions [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. On the other hand, the VSC-HVDC does not need to reverse direct voltage polarity to change the power flow direction, which enables it as a promising solution for constructing MTDC systems. VSC-HVDC technology can also address other conventional grid issues, such as bulk power transmission, asynchronous grid interconnections, <b>back-to-back</b> AC system <b>linking,</b> and voltage/frequency support [20, 21, 22] and it is also suited to facilitate the large-scale integration of renewable energy sources into the grid [23]. With this dawn of VSC-HVDC technology, the dream of implementing large-scale integrated MTDC systems/grids can become a reality in a near future.|$|R
40|$|Ristocetin-A {{belongs to}} the group of the glycoheptapeptide antibiotics. The sulfate salt of ristocetin-A was {{crystallized}} in the P 21 monoclinic space group with a homodimer in the asymmetric unit. The two subunits are <b>linked</b> <b>back-to-back</b> like {{the other members of the}} family via four peptide bonds forming a twisted β-sheet and exposing the binding pockets to the exterior. The two tetrasaccharide parts of this ligand-free antibiotic are in the anti/anti orientations contrary to what was found in the mono- and diliganded ristocetin-A/-(D-Ala-D-Ala) complexes in which the two tetrasaccharides of the dimer are syn/anti. The ligand-free dimer shows however some conformational differences between the two subunits, particularly in the terminal arabinose leading to one extended and one bent conformation of the tetrasaccharide moiety. Comparison between this structure and the two available mono- and diliganded structures confirms that the anti/anti to syn/anti flipping of the tetrasaccharide is a key step in the binding to the D-Ala-D-Ala-containing target sequence and cannot proceed without displacement of the monomer/dimer equilibrium...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The ever {{increasing}} progress of high-voltage high-power fully-controlled semiconductor technology {{continues to have}} a significant impact on the development of advanced power electronic apparatus used to support optimised operations and efficient management of electrical grids, which in many cases, are fully or partially deregulated networks. Developments advance both the high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) power transmission and the flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) technologies. In this paper, an overview of the recent advances in the area of voltage-source converter (VSC) HVDC technology is provided. Selected key multilevel converter topologies are presented. Control and modelling methods are discussed. A list of VSC-based HVDC installations worldwide is provided. It is confirmed that the continuous development of power electronics presents cost-effective opportunities for the utilities to exploit and HVDC remains a key technology. In particular, VSC-HVDC can address not only conventional network issues such as bulk power transmission, asynchronous network interconnections, <b>back-to-back</b> AC system <b>linking</b> and voltage/stability support to mention a few, but also niche markets such as the integration of large scale renewable energy sources with the grid.

40|$|A {{problem of}} {{interest}} in the power industry is the mitigation of interarea and torsional oscillations. Interarea oscillations are due to the dynamics of interarea power transfer and often exhibit poor damping when the aggregate power transfer over a corridor is high relative to the transmission strength. These oscillations can severely restrict system operations and, in some cases, can lead to widespread system disturbances. Torsional oscillations are induced due to the interaction between transmission system disturbances and turbine-generator shaft systems. The high torsional stresses induced due to some of these disturbances reduce the life expectancy of the turbine-generators and, in severe cases, may cause shaft damage. This thesis reports the development of novel control techniques for Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices for the purpose of damping power system interarea and torsional oscillations. In this context, investigations are conducted on a typical three-area power system incorporating FACTS devices. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) and fuzzy logic techniques are used for designing the FACTS controllers. Although attention is focused in the investigations of this thesis on the Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC), studies are also conducted on two other FACTS devices, a three voltage-source converter Generalized Unified Power Flow Controller (GUPFC) and a voltage-source converter <b>back-to-back</b> HVdc <b>link.</b> The results of the investigations conducted in this thesis show that the achieved control designs are effective in damping interarea oscillations as well as the high torsional torques induced in turbine-generator shafts due to clearing and high-speed reclosing of transmission system faults. The controller design procedures adopted in this thesis are general and can be applied to other FACTS devices incorporated in a power system. The results and discussion presented in this thesis should provide valuable information to electric power utilities engaged in planning and operating FACTS devices...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{control and}} simulation {{model has been}} {{presented in this paper}} for a large multi-megawatt Variable Speed Variable Pitch Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) with Energy Storage System (ESS) integration. The generator is of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) type which is then decoupled from the grid using a Fully-Rated <b>back-to-back</b> Converter (FRC) <b>link.</b> A Rotor Flux Oriented Control (RFOC) strategy has been adopted in order to extract the maximum output electromagnetic torque from the generator according to a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) profile for any wind speed lower than rated wind speed. The MPPT method presented in this paper relies on the turbine’s optimal output torque curve. The ESS makes provisions for enhanced performance especially during faults on the system. Dynamic performance of a super-capacitor makes it ideal as the integrated ESS in the WTG for satisfying such performance constraints. Results indicate that the WTG integrated with a super-capacitor ESS provides the required enhanced performance in terms of DC link voltage stability and limiting output power fluctuations during sudden variations in the wind speed as well as enhanced Fault Ride-Through (FRT) capability...|$|R
40|$|Several {{multilevel}} converter topologies have stimulated widespread interests amongst researchers {{because they}} have the capabilities of (i) reaching high voltage ratings without magnetics and transformers and (ii) attaining low Total Harmonic Distortions (THD), using the low switching frequencies of gate-turn-off thyristors (GTOS). This thesis focuses on the diode-clamped multilevel converter topology as the basic module for realizing the high kV voltage rating and the high MVA rating in controllers for the Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS). The thesis has extended the topology configurations to include: (i) multiple modules of multilevel converters and (ii) multimodules of multilevel converters in a <b>back-to-back</b> rectifier/inverter <b>link.</b> These configurations form the backbones for the following multilevel FACTS controllers: (a) the Shunt STAT(ic) COM(pensator), (b) the Series STATCOM, (c) the Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) and (d) the Asynchronous Link. A number of key technical innovations have been assembled together to make the new multilevel FACTS controllers possible. On the sides of the ac lines, the Fundamental Frequency Switching strategy has been extended so that it succeeds in simultaneously (a) lowering the Total Harmonic Distortions in the voltage and current waveforms, (b) controlling directly the ac voltage magnitudes, and (c) sharing the current loading in the parallel modules. On the side of the dc links of the STATCOMs, feedback controls have succeeded in: (a) regulating the total dc link voltages and (b) equalizing the dc capacitor voltages in all the levels. The voltage equalization by feedbacks cannot be accomplished {{in the case of the}} Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) and the Asynchronous Link. A system of locally controlled class-B choppers which transfer the charges from dc capacitors with the higher voltages to their contiguous neighbours with the lower voltages succeeds in equalizing the dc capacitor voltages. The proofs of performance of the multilevel FACTS controllers are substantiated by digital simulations. The equalization of the multilevel rectifier/inverter using the system of class-B choppers has been proven experimentally...|$|R
40|$|This {{entry into}} force of the World Trade Organization (WTO) TRIPS Agreement in 1995 {{transformed}} the international intellectual property system. The harmonization of basic intellectual property standards has operated to protect investment in innovation, limiting risks from unjustified 2 ̆ 7 free riding. 2 ̆ 7 Yet these same harmonized IP standards sharply curtailed the traditional capacity of suppliers of public goods, {{such as health care}} and nutrition, to address the priority needs of less affluent members of society, particularly in (but not limited to) developing countries. In the Doha Declaration, the Waiver Decision of 30 August 2003 and the Article 31 bis Protocol of Amendment, stakeholders concerned with re-opening policy space for the supply of newer pharmaceutical products pushed back against the restrictive elements of the TRIPS Agreement. Governments around the world {{are in the process of}} deciding whether to ratify and accept the Article 31 bis Amendment. Based on their Study for the International Trade Committee of the European Parliament, the authors argue that acceptance of the Amendment will provide a 2 ̆ 7 net benefit 2 ̆ 7 for countries seeking to improve access to medicines. At the insistence of WTO delegations acting on behalf of the originator pharmaceutical industry lobby, Article 31 bis regrettably is saddled with unnecessary administrative hurdles. Nonetheless, through skillful lawyering, political determination and coordinated planning, the system can be made to work. Among other options, expeditious <b>back-to-back</b> compulsory licensing <b>linked</b> with pooled procurement strategies may effectively achieve economies of scale in production and distribution of medicines. The authors doubt that the international political environment would support renegotiation of an 2 ̆ 7 improved 2 ̆ 7 solution. They express concern that failure to bring the Amendment into force will open the door to a campaign to undermine the Waiver Decision. Recent events in Brazil and Thailand illustrate both the opportunities and risks associated with implementing TRIPS exception mechanisms, and help to inform views on the negotiating environment. Specific proposals for regional cooperation in implementing the Amendment are laid out, and the authors emphasize the importance of pursuing concrete transfer of technology measures in support of developing country pharmaceutical manufacturing. Over-reliance on private market mechanisms for the supply of public health goods leaves the international community with an unresolved collective action problem on a large scale...|$|R
