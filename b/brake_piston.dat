25|$|Instead {{of a pair}} of {{horizontal}} bolts that allow the caliper to move straight in and out respective to the car body, a swinging caliper utilizes a single, vertical pivot bolt located somewhere behind the axle centerline. When the driver presses the brakes, the <b>brake</b> <b>piston</b> pushes on the inside piston and rotates the whole caliper inward, when viewed from the top. Because the swinging caliper's piston angle changes relative to the disc, this design uses wedge-shaped pads that are narrower in the rear on the outside and narrower on the front on the inside.|$|E

This action first relieves the hydraulic pressure on the caliper, then applies suction to the <b>brake</b> <b>piston</b> in the caliper assembly, moving it back into its housing and allowing the brake pads to release the rotor.|$|E

50|$|Rim brakes {{are also}} often {{enhanced}} by fitting 'brake boosters'. These are horseshoe shaped plates which are bolted between the <b>brake</b> <b>pistons</b> (Or {{arms in the}} case of V Brakes), forming a bridge over the tyre. This increases the force needed to push the brakes apart, giving a stiffer feel at the brake lever and in many cases better brake bite and hold. In hydraulic rim brakes this has a second benefit which is to protect the brake line which loops over the tyre between the <b>brake</b> <b>pistons</b> from being accidentally hit and broken.|$|R

Their D-Type had either led or was in second place for most of the race until the very last pit stop. When Hawthorn pulled into the pits for the last time the brakes were useless.

40|$|Abstract. A {{design study}} for ceramic pistons was {{undertaken}} {{in order to}} address the overheating problems associated with the caliper during aggressive braking using modern C/C-SiC brake discs. The reasoning behind the piston design and the choice of the shaping technology are explained. Zirconia-toughened mullite (ZTM) ceramic was chosen for the pistons, because this material exhibits a low thermal conductivity, sufficiently high mechanical strength and fracture toughness, as well as very good thermal-shock resistance. The manufacturing technology of experimental ceramic <b>brake</b> <b>pistons</b> involved compounding of the selected starting powders to form a high-solids-loading-containing feedstock, tooling, shaping of green parts by low-pressure injection molding, extraction of the organic binder, pressure-less sintering in air and final machining.

50|$|In {{general the}} W204 C-Class has four trim and {{equipment}} levels: Classic, Elegance, Avantgarde, and AMG. The Classic is the base trim found {{only on the}} smaller four-cylinder engine models and includes Brighton cloth seats with ARTICO leather (vinyl) as an option. The Elegance has ARTICO leather upholstery as standard with real leather as an option. The Avantgarde has Liverpool fabric/ARTICO leather seats with real leather as an option. The Classic and Elegance lines retain the traditional Mercedes-Benz radiator grille, with a vertical three-point star hood emblem, and are designed to appeal to traditional luxury car buyers. The Avantgarde and AMG have a similar grille to the Mercedes sport coupe, with three horizontal bars and a large centre-mounted star. These models have additional equipment including a three-spoke steering wheel, AMG bodykit, lower and stiffer sport suspension, upgraded <b>brake</b> <b>piston</b> calipers, and larger alloy wheels. They are designed to position the C-Class in the sports sedan sector. Unlike previous generations of the C-Class, and other contemporary Mercedes sedans which stayed with the traditional grille and hood ornament, the W204's advertising predominantly features the sport grille and AMG bodykit, especially in Canada and the United States.|$|E
40|$|A valve piston (1) {{contained}} in a hollow cylindrical housing (3) is pressed against a sealing surface to block the flow of pressure medium from an inlet (11) to an outlet (12). The outer surface of the valve piston has a sliding seat supporting an annular <b>brake</b> <b>piston</b> (2). A contact element (13) protrudes from the valve piston outer surface. When the valve piston is in its position blocking the flow of pressure medium, the <b>brake</b> <b>piston</b> is spaced apart from the contact element {{so that in the}} case of excess load the contact element touches the <b>brake</b> <b>piston.</b> The <b>brake</b> <b>piston</b> dips into part (14) of the hollow cylindrical housing volume.

40|$|The under-drive <b>brake</b> <b>piston</b> is an {{essential}} part in the automatic transmissions of automobiles. This component is manufactured by forging after blanking from S 55 C plate with a thickness of 6 mm. It is difficult to design the plate forging process using a thick plate approach since there will be limited material flow as well as large press loads. Furthermore, the under-drive <b>brake</b> <b>piston</b> has a complex shape with a right angle step, which often results in die unfill and abrupt increase in press load. To overcome these obstacles, a separate die for filling material sufficiently to the corner of the right angle step is proposed. However, this approach induces an uncontrolled workpiece surface between the dies, resulting in flash. This excess flash degrades the tool life in the final machining after cold forging as well as increases the cycle time to obtain the net-shape of the part. In the current study, we propose an optimum process design using a conventional die shaped with the benefit of finite element analysis. This approach enhanced the process efficiency without sacrificing the dimensional accuracy in the forged part. As the result, the optimum plate forging process was done with a two stage die, which reduce...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the performance characteristic of an electronic wedge brake (EWB) mechanism for a vehicle braking system. Based on a Gaussian cumulative distribution method, a non-parametric model, using Bell-Shaped curve method {{has been proposed}} in this study to characterize the behavior of an actual EWB mechanism. Therefore, a brake test rig has been developed to investigate {{the performance of the}} Bell-Shaped curve model. For the purpose of validation of EWB, an electronic control unit (ECU) which consists of microcontroller unit (MCU), H-Bridge driver and opto-coupler is designed to control the EWB’s pinion according to the given rotational input during the experiment. The response measured throughout the experiment is the gapping displacement of the <b>brake</b> <b>piston,</b> clamping force and also brake torque of the EWB mechanism. The responses of the actual EWB mechanism obtained from the experiment are compared with the proposed Bell-Shaped curve. The result of the study shows that the response of the Bell-Shaped curve model closely follows the response of a real EWB actuator in term of clamping force and brake torque with percentage of errors less than 10 %...|$|E

According to the driver's manipulation of the control, {{some or all of}} the vacuum will be destroyed in the process.

The driver can control the amount of braking effort by admitting more or less air to the train pipe.|$|R
50|$|A major advance was the {{adoption}} of a vacuum braking system, in which flexible pipes were connected between all the vehicles of the train, and brakes on each vehicle could be controlled from the locomotive. The earliest scheme was a simple vacuum brake, in which vacuum was created by operation of a valve on the locomotive; the vacuum actuated <b>brake</b> <b>pistons</b> on each vehicle, and the degree of braking could be increased or decreased by the driver. Vacuum, rather than compressed air, was preferred because steam locomotives can be fitted with ejectors; venturi devices that create vacuum without moving parts.|$|R

50|$|On a {{hydraulic}} vehicle braking systems, the bleed screws (sometimes known as bleed nipples or bleeder valves) are {{located at the}} top of each brake caliper to allow bleeding of the braking system. Whenever service work has been performed on the braking system which might have introduced air into the system (i.e. the hydraulic system has been opened), the air must be bled out. This is necessary for correct operation of the system, because air compresses (as opposed to brake fluid which is not compressible). Air in the system reduces the maximum pressure applied to the <b>brake</b> <b>pistons</b> and can lead to loss of braking ability.|$|R

In extreme cases this has led to breaking couplings and causing the train to divide.|$|R
50|$|Brake fluids must {{maintain}} {{a low level}} of compressibility, even with varying temperatures to accommodate different environmental conditions.

50|$|Brake {{failure is}} also caused by brake drum thermal {{expansion}} in which brake shoe clearance becomes excessive from wear. This was largely remedied in the 1950s by self-adjusting brakes. Maladjustment with wear {{is still a}} factor in trucks with drum air brakes. A Canadian survey of randomly stopped heavy trucks found over 10% of trucks using self-adjusting brakes {{had at least one}} brake out of adjustment, due either to failure of the self-adjust mechanism or wear beyond the capacity of the self adjuster. Newer <b>brake</b> <b>pistons</b> ("cans") extend stroke from about 65 mm to about 75 mm; since about 30 mm of stroke is used just putting the pads in contact with the drum, the added 10 mm of stroke is over 25% increase in useful stroke. Longer stroke reduces especially wear-related fade, but drum brakes are still fundamentally prone to fade when hot.|$|R
50|$|Power brakes are {{a system}} of {{hydraulics}} used to slow down or stop most motor vehicles. It uses a combination of mechanical components to multiply the force applied to the brake pedal by the driver into enough force to actuate the brakes and stop a vehicle that can weigh several tons. The brake pedal {{is connected to the}} vacuum booster which is the first step of the force multiplication. The booster passes the force to the master cylinder which compresses a liquid and forces it through the brake lines to the brakes themselves. The liquid that is pushed into the brakes activates the brake calipers which in the case of disc brakes, push against the brake rotor causing friction that slows and eventually stops the rotation of the vehicles wheels. In drum <b>brakes,</b> <b>pistons</b> push two shoes against the brake drum accomplishing the same effect.|$|R

An analytical model for the brake system is presented, that includes formulation for each system component. Subsequently, the two most important safety homologation standards for light vehicle brake systems (both US and EU legislations) are analyzed. Their requirements are integrated in a Microsoft Excel tool to enable a quick brake system design that meets the government safety standards.
