It is of three bays defined by circular piers topped by square abaci with scalloped cushion capitals, supporting chamfered semi-circular arches. The nave south arcade is early 13th century and Perpendicular. The piers supporting the semi-circular arches are narrower than those at the north, the arches having deeper chamfered reveals. The capitals are frustum-style of four facets, with abaci of floriate detailing reminiscent of crocketing, except that on the pier respond at the west carved as flat leaf. In both aisles either side of the nave are rows of pews, provided by Sir Edmund Turnor in 1700. Within the south aisle are two stained glass windows. The chamfered chancel arch sits on polygonal responds with part octagonal capitals in which are embossed and painted cyphers of King George VI between lily floral motifs on one, and rose on the other.The nave arcades run through to corresponding chancel arcades separating the north and south chancel chapels from the chancel.

40|$|By early 2000, {{the number}} of {{commercial}} livestock herds in Michigan with bovine tuberculosis (TB) had increased {{to the point that}} policy makers were considering alternative ways to enable farmers to continue production with access to markets while eliminating TB and protecting the public's health. If at least one animal on a farm is found to have TB, a farmer currently has two choices about the future assuming the goal is to stay in the livestock business. Alternative one is depopulation; all animals are removed to a state facility, slaughtered, and tested. A new herd may be purchased after a state supervised clean up and waiting period is completed; this may take one year. Alternative two is test and remove; a recurring series of testing is initiated, but only individual reactor or suspect animals are removed for slaughter and further testing. In both alternatives, regulations allow indemnity payments to be made to the owner by the state and federal governments. This paper analyzes the financial impact of each alternative on two dairy benchmark farms. One has 75 milk cows, the other 150. Monthly cash flow projections for two years were made using FINFLO. A <b>base</b> <b>projection</b> was compared to the above alternatives assuming constant herd size (except for the impact of TB) and constant price levels. The main goal was to illustrate how a farmer might analyze the alternatives if faced with TB infected animals. The 75 cow farm started with $ 8, 309 of cash on January 1, 2000. The base projections resulted in cash of $ 34, 230 by December 31, 2001. Ending cash after two years for depopulation or test and remove were $ 16, 095 and $ 15, 801, respectively. The 75 cow farm started with a net worth of $ 624, 940 on January 1, 2000. The <b>base</b> <b>projection</b> increased net worth by $ 66, 542 over the two years. For depopulation or test and remove, the change in net worth by the end of 2001 was $- 15, 345 and $ 48, 256, respectively. The 150 cow farm started with $ 30, 659 of cash on January 1, 2000. The base projections resulted in cash of $ 40, 437 by December 31, 2001. Ending cash after two years for depopulation or test and remove were $ 2, 972 and $ 13, 290, respectively. The 150 cow farm started with a net worth of $ 1, 122, 940 on January 1, 2000. The <b>base</b> <b>projection</b> increased net worth by $ 31, 765 over the two years. For depopulation or test and remove, the change in net worth by the end of 2001 was $- 95, 904 and $- 1, 925, respectively. Benchmark model farms will not exactly fit any particular farm. Each owner faced with TB should make their own projections using their unique situation and timing of cash flows. Once an alternative is adopted, monthly financial comparison sheets can be helpful in managing the transition to TB free status. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|E

The impact of macroeconomic variables are evaluated by computing both historical decompositions (HDCs) and variance decompositions (VDCs) in a six-variable VAR model. The VDC results suggest fiscal policy variable exerts a modest and significant impact on residential expenditures, monetary policy variables appear to have larger and perceptible influences on residential expenditures in the long run. The HDC findings, on the other hand, indicate that money stock marginally lowers the MSE of <b>base</b> <b>projection</b> of residential investment over the pre-deregulation period.

We investigate the investment strategy during the accumulation phase to deal with longevity risk during the decumulation phase. The longevity risk is demonstrated using the U.

The optimal asset allocation and contribution rate are determined by minimizing the variance of the error between the value of pension fund and required pension fund plus {{the square of the}} expected value of the error. The required pension fund is decided by the pension fund target, measured using the income replacement ratio. We consider four assets in the asset allocation and observe four types of changes to the rebalancing investment strategies. The results show a life cycle investment strategy and indicate that longevity risk can be hedged by either raising the contribution rate or setting a more aggressive asset allocation. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a plan proposed by Warren Buffett, in which importers {{would be required}} to obtain certificates proportional to the amount of non-oil goods (and possibly also services) they brought into the country. These certificates would be granted to firms that exported goods. Exporting firms could then sell certificates to importing firms on an organized market. In this paper, starting from a relatively neutral projection of all major variables for the U. S. economy, we estimate that the plan would raise the price of imports by approximately 9 percent, quickly reducing the current account deficit to about 2 percent of GDP. We discuss several problems that might arise with the implementation of the Buffett plan, including possible instability in the price of certificates and retaliation by U. S. trade partners. We also consider an alternative version of the Buffett plan, in which certificates would be sold at a government auction, rather than granted to exporters. The revenues from certificate sales would then be used to finance a reduction in FICA payroll taxes. We report the results of simulations of the alternative plan's effects on macroeconomic balances and GDP growth. Notably, the alternative plan would lessen the severity of the growth recession expected in our <b>base</b> <b>projection.</b> ...|$|E

The proposed method overcomes the difficulty associated with Krylov subspace <b>based</b> <b>projection</b> MOR methods for reducing circuits with many ports. The novelty of the proposed method lies {{on the fact that}} we separately compute the poles and residues of each transfer function in the reduced admittance matrices. Specifically we apply traditional subspace projection method for computing poles and use hierarchical symbolic analysis for computing frequency responses of admittances to determine the residues of transfer functions. In this way, we only use necessary poles (smaller number of poles) to archive the same accuracy than subspace <b>projection</b> <b>based</b> methods. Finally convex programming based optimization is used to enforce the passivity of the reduced models. The new method can lead to much smaller reduced models for a given frequency range or much higher accuracy given the same model sizes than subspace <b>projection</b> <b>based</b> methods for multi-port interconnect circuits.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concerns the}} model reduction of linear periodic descriptor systems both in continuous and discrete-time case. In this dissertation, mainly the <b>projection</b> <b>based</b> approaches are considered for model order reduction of linear periodic time varying descriptor systems. Krylov <b>based</b> <b>projection</b> method {{is used for}} large continuous-time periodic descriptor systems and balancing <b>based</b> <b>projection</b> technique is applied to large sparse discrete-time periodic descriptor systems to generate the reduce systems. For very large dimensional state space systems, both the techniques produce large dimensional solutions. Hence, a recycling technique is used in Krylov <b>based</b> <b>projection</b> methods which helps to compute low rank solutions of the state space systems and also accelerate the computational convergence. The outline of the proposed model order reduction procedure is given with more details. The accuracy and suitability of the proposed method is demonstrated through different examples of different orders. Model reduction techniques based on balance truncation require to solve matrix equations. For periodic time-varying descriptor systems, these matrix equations are projected generalized periodic Lyapunov equations and the solutions are also time-varying. The cyclic lifted representation of the periodic time-varying descriptor systems is considered in this dissertation and the resulting lifted projected Lyapunov equations are solved to achieve the periodic reachability and observability Gramians of the original periodic systems. The main advantage of this solution technique is that the cyclic structures of projected Lyapunov equations can handle the time-varying dimensions {{as well as the}} singularity of the period matrix pairs very easily. One can also exploit the theory of time-invariant systems for the control of periodic ones, provided that the results achieved can be easily re-interpreted in the periodic framework. Since the dimension of cyclic lifted system becomes very high for large dimensional periodic systems, one needs to solve the very large scale periodic Lyapunov equations which also generate very large dimensional solutions. Hence iterative techniques, which are the generalization and modification of alternating directions implicit (ADI) method and generalized Smith method, are implemented to obtain low rank Cholesky factors of the solutions of the periodic Lyapunov equations. Also the application of the solvers in balancing-based model reduction of discrete-time periodic descriptor systems is discussed. Numerical results are given to illustrate the effciency and accuracy of the proposed methods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Similarity {{functions}} {{are widely used}} in many machine learn-ing or pattern recognition tasks. We consider here a recent framework for binary classification, proposed by Balcan et al., allowing to learn in a potentially non geometrical space based on good similarity func-tions. This framework is a generalization {{of the notion of}} kernels used in support vector machines in the sense that allows one to use similarity functions that {{do not need to be}} positive semi-definite nor symmetric. The similarities are then used to define an explicit projection space where a linear classifier with good generalization properties can be learned. In this paper, we propose to study experimentally the usefulness of similar-ity <b>based</b> <b>projection</b> spaces for transfer learning issues. More precisely, we consider the problem of domain adaptation where the distributions generating learning data and test data are somewhat different. We stand in the case where no information on the test labels is available. We show that a simple renormalization of a good similarity function taking into account the test data allows us to learn classifiers more performing on the target distribution for difficult adaptation problems. Moreover, this normalization always helps to improve the model when we try to regu-larize the similarity <b>based</b> <b>projection</b> space in order to move closer the two distributions.

40|$|Indian Ganga Basin (IGB), one of {{the most}} densely {{populated}} areas in the world, is facing a significant threat to food grain production, besides increased yield gap between actual and potential production, due to climate change. We have analyzed the spatial variability of climate change impacts on rice and wheat yields at three different locations representing the upper, middle and lower IGB. The DSSAT model is used to simulate the effects of climate variability and climate change on rice and wheat yields by analyzing: (i) spatial crop yield response to current climate, and (ii) impact of a changing climate as projected by two regional climate models, REMO and HadRM 3, based on SRES A 1 B emission scenarios for the period 2011 - 2040. Results for current climate demonstrate a significant gap between actual and potential yield for upper, middle and lower IGB stations. The analysis <b>based</b> on RCM <b>projections</b> shows that during 2011 - 2040, the largest reduction in rice and wheat yields will occur in the upper IGB (reduction of potential rice and wheat yield respectively by 43. 2 % and 20. 9 % by REMO, and 24. 8 % and 17. 2 % by HadRM 3). In the lower IGB, however, contrasting results are obtained, with HadRM 3 <b>based</b> <b>projections</b> showing an increase in the potential rice and wheat yields, whereas, REMO <b>based</b> <b>projections</b> show decreased potential yields. We discuss the influence of agro-climatic factors; variation in temperature, length of maturity period and leaf area index which are responsible for modeled spatial variability in crop yield response within the IGB.
