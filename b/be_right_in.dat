2500|$|Remembering his and Barger’s structure-activity {{analysis}} of 1910, Dale wrote in 1953: “Doubtless I {{ought to have}} seen that nor-adrenaline might be the main transmitter – that Elliott’s theory might <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> principle and faulty only in this detail. … It is easy, of course, to be wise {{in the light of}} facts recently discovered; lacking them I failed to jump to the truth, and I can hardly claim credit for having crawled so near and then stopped short of it.” ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{lined up}} for takeoff on runway 31, a range of hills {{including}} [...] Beacon Hill would <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> front of the aircraft. The aircraft {{had to make a}} sharp 65-degree left turn soon after takeoff to avoid the hills (i.e. the reverse of a Runway 13 landing). If a runway change occurred due to wind change from runway 13 departures to runway 31 departures, planes that were loaded to maximum payload for runway 13 departures had to return to the terminal to offload some goods to provide enough climbing clearance over buildings during a runway 31 departure.|$|E

They <b>were</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> trying to {{massacre}} us. They <b>are</b> <b>right</b> now <b>in</b> saying we must not marry our kind. According to their lights they <b>are</b> <b>right.</b> They know--it <b>is</b> time that we also knew--that you cannot have pigmies and giants in one world together. Caterham has said that again and again--clearly--their world or ours." ...|$|R

2500|$|.....One of {{the most}} well known ways our {{tradition}} {{has been able to}} hold onto both the scientific theory of evolution as well as the concept of a purposeful creation was by reading the creation story in Genesis in a more allegorical sense. One famous medieval commentary proclaims that the days of creation, as outlined in the book of Bereshit, could be seen as representative of the stages of creation and not literal 24 hour periods. Thus each Biblical day could have accounted for thousands or even millions of years. In that way the progression according to both evolution and the Torah remains essentially the same: first the elements were created, then the waters, the plants, the animals, and finally us. Therefore, Genesis and Darwin can both <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> a factual analysis even while we acknowledge that our attitudes towards these shared facts are shaped much more strongly by the Torah – we agree how the process unfolded but disagree that it was random.|$|E
2500|$|More {{balanced}} biographies are Charley Gordon—An Eminent Victorian Reassessed (1978) by Charles Chenevix Trench and Gordon—the Man Behind the Legend (1988) by John Pollock. Urban {{argued that}} Gordon's final stand was [...] "significant" [...] {{because it was}} [...] "...a perversion of the democratic process" [...] as he [...] "managed to subvert government policy", making {{the beginning of a}} new era where decision-makers had to consider the power of media. In Khartoum—The Ultimate Imperial Adventure (2005), Michael Asher puts Gordon's works in the Sudan in a broad context. Asher concludes: [...] "He did not save the country from invasion or disaster, but among the British heroes of all ages, there is perhaps no other who stands out so prominently as an individualist, a man ready to die for his principles. Here was one man among men who did not do what he was told, but what he believed to <b>be</b> <b>right.</b> <b>In</b> a world moving inexorably towards conformity, it would be well to remember Gordon of Khartoum." ...|$|E
2500|$|In some Biblical translations, chapter 28 of Deuteronomy {{ends with}} [...] "These {{are the words}} of the {{covenant}} which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which He made with them in Horeb," [...] reading therefore that the covenant made or renewed at Moab was the one detailed in the preceding chapters of Deuteronomy. In the majority of modern texts, however, these words form verse 1 of chapter 29. Charles Ellicott argued that the Hebrew Bibles which [...] "add this verse to the previous chapter, and begin Deuteronomy 29 at the second verse [...] [...] [...] cannot <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> so doing. For though the pronoun 'these' in Hebrew has nothing to determine whether it belongs to what precedes or to what follows, yet the context shows that the covenant is described in Deuteronomy 29, not in Deuteronomy 28." [...] Similarly, John Gill argued that {{the words of the}} covenant are [...] "not what go before, but follow after, in the next chapters, {{to the end of the}} book." ...|$|E
