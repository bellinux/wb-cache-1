5|$|Through {{the steady}} {{taxation}} of Edward III's reign, parliament – {{and in particular}} the Commons – gained political influence. A consensus emerged that in order for a tax to <b>be</b> <b>just,</b> <b>the</b> king had to prove its necessity, it had to be granted by the community of the realm, and it had to be to the benefit of that community. In addition to imposing taxes, parliament would also present petitions for redress of grievances to the king, most often concerning misgovernment by royal officials. This way the system was beneficial for both parties. Through this process the commons, and the community they represented, became increasingly politically aware, and the foundation was laid for the particular English brand of constitutional monarchy.|$|E

A voting organized in the Cabildo by the military, attended only by supporters of the coup, proclaimed Lavalle interim governor, and the military forces in the Fort gave up the resistance at 13:00, accepting Lavalle’s rule. The Hall of Representatives, the legislature of Buenos Aires, was closed.|$|E

25|$|In maximal {{projection}} reduplication, the A-not-A operator copies the maximal projection {{that contains}} the adjacent MWd and moves the reduplicant either {{to the left or}} {{to the right of the}} base. The base may <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> MWd or the maximal projection containing the MWd. The maximal projection may be any XP (VP, AP, PP etc.). The negation is then inserted between the reduplicant and base to form a grammatical sentence. In (10.a) the A-not-A operator copies the maximal projection VP taoyan Lisi. The reduplicant taoyan Lisi is put at the left of the base taoyan Lisi and then the negative constituent bu is inserted in between.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Nathan-Turner {{was trying}} to figure out what to do about K-9. The robot dog was very popular among {{children}} but was difficult to deal with technically and Nathan-Turner felt that it made the TARDIS crew almost overwhelmingly formidable. He decided that a child-orientated spin-off series with K-9 might <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> thing. However, such a series would require a human as the lead, and his prime candidate for this role was Sladen. He pitched the part to the actress as a departure from what she had previously done: she would be returning as Sarah Jane Smith, but she would do so as the heroine and not just a sidekick. This offer Sladen accepted.|$|E
25|$|In 1978 {{disability}} {{rights activists}} in Denver, Colorado, {{organized by the}} Atlantis Community, held a sit-in and blockade of the Denver Regional Transit Authority buses in 1978. They were protesting the fact that city’s transit system was completely inaccessible for the physically disabled. This action proved to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> {{first in a series}} of civil disobedience demonstrations that lasted for a year until the Denver Transit Authority finally bought buses equipped with wheelchair lifts. In 1983, Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transit (ADAPT) was responsible for another civil disobedience campaign also in Denver that lasted seven years. They targeted the American Public Transport Association in protest of inaccessible public transportation; this campaign ended in 1990 when bus lifts for people using wheelchairs were required nationwide by the Americans with Disabilities Act.|$|E

25|$|Then Geraint Jones smacked two fours off Hussey {{to end the}} over, {{meaning that}} England needed 39 off 36 balls. Five balls later, a miscued sweep off Hogg hit Geraint Jones on the pads – gone for 71 – and England only had three wickets to spare. Two more balls were {{delivered}} before that tally was cut down to two – Hussey bowled Simon Jones for a two-ball one, so with Gough and Giles in, England needed 35 off 29 balls. Despite taking the runs off Hussey, Brett Lee's 47th over only yielded a single, as his variations of length turned out to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> thing. However, Ponting now needed another over from either Hussey, Hogg or Symonds – deciding to use Hussey, he was punished, as Giles hit twos to both the off and leg side, and a wide from Hussey resulting in a nine-run over. Lee then came back on, and with his short ball had Giles playing a definitely unorthodox stroke – a sliced edge over Gilchrist's head for four.|$|E

The {{location of the}} islands lay on a great circle route that is also perpendicular to the region of (presumed) uplifted land at the coast near Cape Mendocino and any energy distributed would be the strongest in that direction. No tsunami was detected [...] at Johnston Atoll, [...] from Cape Mendocino in the north Pacific Ocean, but bottom pressure recorders registered a maximum amplitude of [...] in [...] {{of water in the}} Gulf of Alaska, with 3.75 hours of travel time. While the waves generated by the earthquake were limited, the event demonstrated the rapid onset of tsunami hazards, giving little time for coastal residents to prepare. And in this case, the strongest waves came ashore in Crescent City three to four hours after the initial surge, but it is possible to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> opposite where the first waves could be the strongest. Also detailed from this event was that the wave hazard can be of long duration, with wave action lingering for more than eight hours.|$|E
500|$|These books {{laid the}} {{foundation}} for Marx and Engels's most famous work, a political pamphlet that has since come to be commonly known as The Communist Manifesto. While residing in Brussels in 1846, Marx continued his association with the secret radical organisation League of the Just. As noted above, Marx thought the League to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> sort of radical organisation that was needed to spur the working class of Europe toward the mass movement that would bring about a working class revolution. However, to organise the working class into a mass movement the League had to cease its [...] "secret" [...] or [...] "underground" [...] orientation and operate in the open as a political party. Members of the League eventually became persuaded in this regard. Accordingly, in June 1847 the League was reorganised by its membership into a new open [...] "above ground" [...] political society that appealed directly to the working classes. This new open political society was called the Communist League. Both Marx and Engels participated in drawing the programme and organisational principles of the new Communist League.|$|E

Similarly, Buchanan characterized the Hoops courses as [...] "incredibly demanding", and Atkin cited that mode's Trick difficulty level as [...] "amazingly tough". Bob and John Nolan wrote that people who [...] "love to loop around the skies of Flight Simulator 5 will go bananas for" [...] the aerobatics; but the pair commented that combat flight simulator players [...] "might get a little edgy once the wow-power wears off." [...] However, Atkin believed that only those [...] "never happy without something to shoot at" [...] could be disappointed {{by the lack of}} combat: other players will [...] "be too busy choreographing aerial ballets, pulling off death-defying aerobatic stunts, or just enjoying a quiet soar down the ridge line to miss that stuff".

Alan Pergament of The Buffalo News commented that [...] "like all hourlong episodes of comedies, this one becomes a little bloated in the middle.

[...] Whitney Matheson of USA Today said she [...] "was bored to tears" [...] by the episode, while Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk thought it was a [...] "fun episode". Seth Davis of Sports Illustrated was not complimentary towards Connick: [...] "Whoever {{came up with the idea}} to cast Connick on Will & Grace should be fired." [...] A writer from Entertainment Weekly, however, commented that Leo [...] "fits right in to the antic Will & Grace world of Will, Grace, Jack, and Karen." [...] Matt Roush of TV Guide was not thrilled of the idea of Grace getting married, writing: [...] "Well, is the show called Will & Grace & Leo? I don't think so."

500|$|Cooper's {{style of}} underplaying before the camera {{surprised}} {{many of his}} directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, he recognized the camera's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements. Commenting on Cooper's performance in Sergeant York, director Howard Hawks observed, [...] "He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be working. He was a strange actor because you'd look at him during a scene and you'd think ... this isn't {{going to be any}} good. But when you saw the rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he'd been thinking." [...] Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in Pride of the Yankees, noting, [...] "What I thought was underplaying turned out to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> right approach. On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures." [...] His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, [...] "The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering—and that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. You just didn't notice it until you saw it on the screen. I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with." ...|$|E
