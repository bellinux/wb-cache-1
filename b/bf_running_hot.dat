40|$|Background: Numerous studies {{about the}} {{interaction}} between footwear (and barefoot) and kinematic and kinetic outcomes have been published {{over the last few}} years. Recent studies however lead {{to the conclusion that the}} assumed interactions depend mainly on the subjects' experience of barefoot (BF) walking/running, the preferred running strike pattern, the speed, the hardness of the surface, the thickness of the midsole material, and the runners' level of ability. The aim of the present study was to investigate lower leg kinematics of <b>BF</b> <b>running</b> and running in minimal running shoes (MRS) to assess comparability of BF kinematics in both conditions. To systematically compare both conditions we monitored the influencing variables described above in our measurement setup. We hypothesized that running in MRS does not alter lower leg kinematics compared to <b>BF</b> <b>running.</b> Methods: Thirty-seven subjects, injury-free and active in sports, ran BF on an EVA foam runway, and also ran shod wearing Nike Free 3. 0 on a tartan indoor track. Lower-leg 3 D kinematics was measured to quantify rearfoot and ankle movements. Skin markers were used in both shod and <b>BF</b> <b>running.</b> Results: All runners revealed rearfoot strike pattern when running barefoot. Differences between <b>BF</b> and MRS <b>running</b> occurred particularly during the initial stance phase of running, both in the sagittal and the frontal planes. <b>BF</b> <b>running</b> revealed a flatter foot placement, a more plantar flexed ankle joint and less inverted rearfoot at touchdown compared to MRS <b>running.</b> Conclusion: <b>BF</b> <b>running</b> does not change the landing automatically to forefoot running, especially after a systematic exclusion of surface and other influencing factors. The Nike Free 3. 0 mimics some BF features. Nevertheless, changes in design of the Nike Free should be considered in order to mimic BF movement even more closely...|$|R
40|$|Research {{interest}} in the biomechanics of barefoot (<b>BF)</b> <b>running</b> has expanded considerably in recent years. In response to the recent {{interest in}} <b>BF</b> <b>running,</b> new footwear models have been developed {{that are designed to}} integrate the benefits of <b>running</b> <b>BF</b> into a shod condition (Sinclair, Hobbs, Currigan, & Taylor, 2013). Several BF-inspired shoe (BFIS) models are now commercially available and vary considerably in terms of their design characteristics. The importance of lower extremity limb stiffness is now recognised in biomechanical literature, as we seek to gain more insight into the mechanics of human locomotion and obtain more clinically relevant information regarding the aetiology of chronic lower limb injuries (Butler, Crowell, & McClay Davis, 2003). Limb stiffness during running has been associated with both performance and injury aetiology (Williams, McClay Davis, Scholz, Hamill, & Buchanan, 2003) ...|$|R

Test of RE consisted of dynamic stretching warm-up and 7 minutes run on treadmill (constant velocity 7 km·h- 1, inclination + 1 %) BF and shoed (RS). Hearth rate (HR; beats·min- 1) and oxygen uptake (RE, running economy; ml·kg- 1 ·min- 1) were collected in last two minutes of each test.

40|$|Backgound: Barefoot (<b>BF)</b> <b>running</b> has {{recently}} increased in popularity with {{claims that it}} is more natural and may result in fewer injuries due to a reduction in impact loading. However, novice BF runners do not necessarily immediately switch to a forefoot strike pattern. This may increase mechanical parameters such as loading rate, which has been associated with certain running-related injuries, specifically, tibial stress fractures, patellofemoral pain, and plantar fasciitis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine changes in loading parameters between typical shod <b>running</b> and instructed <b>BF</b> <b>running</b> with real-time force feedback. Methods: Forty-nine patients seeking treatment for a lower extremity injury ran on a force-sensing treadmill in their typical shod condition and then BF at the same speed. While BF they received verbal instruction and real-time feedback of vertical ground reaction forces. Results: While 92 % of subjects (n =  45) demonstrated a rearfoot strike pattern when shod, only 2 % (n =  1) did during the instructed BF run. Additionally, while BF 47 % (n =  23) eliminated the vertical impact transient in all eight steps analyzed. All loading variables of interest were significantly reduced from the shod to instructed BF condition. These included maximum instantaneous and average vertical loading rates of the ground reaction force (p <  0. 0001), stiffness during initial loading (p <  0. 0001), and peak medial (p =  0. 001) and lateral (p <  0. 0001) ground reaction forces and impulses in the vertical (p <  0. 0001), medial (p =  0. 047), and lateral (p <  0. 0001) directions. Conclusion: As impact loading has been associated with certain running-related injuries, instruction and feedback on the proper forefoot strike pattern may help reduce the injury risk associated with transitioning to <b>BF</b> <b>running...</b>|$|R

40|$|Barefoot (<b>BF)</b> <b>running</b> has {{developed}} into a recent training technique for elite and sub-elite endurance runners. <b>BF</b> <b>running</b> is a recent type of training that may improve a runner’s Running Economy (RE) and, ultimately performance, by allowing for an enhancement of the foot and lower leg musculature, which, in turn, could improve running biomechanics by allowing the runner {{to land on the}} mid- or fore-foot. In spite of the many anecdotal statements that have been raised suggesting the benefits of <b>BF</b> <b>running,</b> there has been limited research evaluating a systematic training program designed to teach this skill and then test the outcome of this training on a runner’s economy and race performance. PURPOSE: To determine if the use of a systematic barefoot running training program would result in an improved running economy and race performance. HYPOTHESIS: That this 10 -week BF training program would yield an improvement in running economy as well as 5 K race performance. METHODS: To date, 3 adult males who were habitual shoe-wearing runners (SHOD) have completed all testing. Each participant reported to the laboratory four times. On Day 1, informed consent was completed and subject characteristics were determined including height, body mass, and body composition followed by a VO 2 max test on a treadmill using a Cosmed K 4 b 2 portable telemetric gas analysis system. Four to seven days later (Day 2), subject’s underwent RE tests on a treadmill in three conditions (flat (4 ms - 1), decline (4. 5 ms - 1 at - 5 % grade), and incline (3 ms - 1 at 5 % grade)) and a 5 k time trial performed on an indoor track. All tests were conducted in the SHOD condition. Following testing, subjects were allotted a one week break-in period prior to embarking on the 10 -week systematic barefoot training program. This BF training program was a gentle and progressive program designed to minimize injury while learning the <b>BF</b> <b>running</b> skill. After ten weeks of barefoot running, Day 1 and 2 testing were repeated in the BF condition. RESULTS: Following the 10 -week BF training program and compared to the SHOD condition, VO 2 max did not change, while RE improved 4. 0 % (flat), 3. 3 % (incline), and 0. 1 % (decline) in the BF condition. The 5 k race time decreased ~ 1. 0 % post-training with mile split improvements observed mostly at mile 3. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that a progressive, 10 -week barefoot running training program may result in improved RE that, in turn, yields a faster race performanc...|$|R

40|$|Running shoe {{technology}} has advanced {{significantly in the}} last 50 years, although the overall injury rate has yet to decrease. Barefoot (<b>BF)</b> <b>running</b> has become increasing more popular in the last 10 years. The current investigation aimed to explore differences in the forces produced by the foot muscles during BF and shod (SH) running. Fifteen male participants ran at 4. 0 m. s- 1 (± 5 %). Kinematics were measured using an eight-camera motion analysis system alongside ground reaction forces. Peak and average stance phase forces from the flexor digitorum longus (FDL), flexor hallucis longus (FHL), peroneus longus (PL), extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and extensor hallucis longus (EHL) muscles were obtained using OpenSim v 3. 2. Peak and average forces of the FDL, FHL and PL muscles were significantly larger when <b>running</b> <b>BF,</b> whereas peak and average forces of the FHL and EHL muscles were significantly larger when running SH. This study supports the conjecture that the plantar muscles are required to work harder when <b>running</b> <b>BF</b> in relation to SH, indicating that BF training may serve to strengthen the foot musculature...|$|R

40|$|Short-term {{effects of}} barefoot and {{simulated}} barefoot running {{have been widely}} discussed in recent years. Consequences of adopting barefoot running for a long period, including as a training approach, still remain unknown. The present study evaluated the influence of 16 weeks of progressive barefoot running training on impact force and muscle activation in habitual shod runners. Six habitual shod runners (3 men and 3 women, 29. 5 ± 7. 3 years) were tested barefoot (BF) and shod (SH), before and after 16 weeks of progressive barefoot running training. Tests consisted of running on instrumented treadmill at 9 km/h, for 10 minutes in each experimental condition. Nine data acquisitions (10 s) of vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) and electromyographic (EMG) signal were conducted in each experimental condition for each test. BF training was effective to alter VGRF and EMG parameters of running in habitual shod runners, regardless of footwear condition (SH or BF). The magnitude of first peak of VGRF (Fy 1) and the impulse of the first 50 ms decreased after training for BF and SH (p< 0. 01). The activation reduced from PRE to POST training for four muscles in <b>BF</b> <b>running</b> (p< 0. 001), whereas only muscle gastrocnemius lateralis decreased significantly its activation (p< 0. 01) in SH running. A 16 -week progressive barefoot running training {{seems to be an}} effective training strategy to reduce impact force, improve shock attenuation and to decrease muscle activation intensity, not only in <b>BF</b> <b>running,</b> but also in SH <b>running,</b> although <b>BF</b> condition seems to be more influenced by BF training...|$|R

40|$|Running is an accessible, {{inexpensive}} form of exercise. However, running {{injuries are}} common and burdensome. Many runners are curious about switching to barefoot (<b>BF)</b> <b>running</b> or minimalist shoes to avoid injuries, which is {{commonly associated with}} rearfoot strikers (runners who land on the posterior third of their foot) landing on the middle or front third (mid- or forefoot strike; FFS). My purposes were to determine if undocumented aspects of FFS and <b>BF</b> <b>running</b> are beneficial or harmful compared to rearfoot striking (RFS), and if any potential benefits of FFS or <b>BF</b> <b>running</b> {{can be achieved by}} shortening one’s stride length (SL) when using a RFS. I addressed this by conducting four studies. For all studies, habitual rearfoot (hRF) and habitual mid/forefoot strikers (hFF) ran with a RFS, FFS, and BF, and with a shorter SL. I looked at several ground reaction force (GRF) variables, kinematics, joint kinetics, tibial accelerations, stride time variability, and tibial bone stresses. Impact peaks were present in the vertical GRF for RFS and in the posterior and medial directions with a FFS. Loading rates were generally higher in those same respective directions for the two foot strike styles. hRF decreased their vertical GRF variables by using a FFS. Joint moments and contact forces were generally larger at the ankle for FFS while they were similar or larger at the hip for RFS. Some knee moments and contact forces were larger for RFS while others were larger for FFS. Patellofemoral loads were similar for foot strike styles. Nearly all moments and contact forces decreased with a shorter SL. Free moment was distinctly different between foot strikes. Additionally, step width was narrower for FFS, but ITB strain and strain rate were similar, while RFS demonstrated greater pelvic drop. Shortening one’s SL had many minor beneficial effects, including a wider SW, and decreased free moment, pelvic drop, hip adduction, ankle eversion, ITB strain and strain rate. Stride interval long range correlations became more patterned for the novel conditions, suggesting runners were not operating in their optimal state of adaptability, possibly making them susceptible to injury. Finally, FFS resulted in higher compressive, tensile, and shear stresses in the distal tibia compared to RFS and BF. An 8 % shorter SL only significantly decreased shear stresses. In conclusion, not all lower extremity loading variables are lower with a FFS or when running BF; in fact, several variables were elevated compared to RFS. Therefore, switching to a FFS (whether shod or BF), may not alleviate certain pain or help runners avoid injury. A more viable option may be to shorten one’s SL 10 %...|$|R
