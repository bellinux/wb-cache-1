5000|$|A <b>banksman</b> {{may also}} be {{responsible}} for directing the movement and loading/unloading of lorries, or directing the movement of other plant. [...] A <b>banksman</b> may also control the movements of an excavator, by carefully monitoring the bucket for any obstructions or underground services.|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} of the 1881 census, the only {{individual}} of this name living near Chesterfield was a colliery <b>banksman</b> aged 26 born in Shelsfield Kent. He was living with a wife and son at Clowne.|$|E
50|$|The {{most obvious}} visible {{difference}} is that the lower edges of the cab windows were now angled downwards rather than horizontal. This was to improve visibility at close-range, particularly when being marshalled by a <b>banksman</b> standing nearby.|$|E
50|$|Crane {{or large}} vehicle drivers {{do not always}} have clear {{visibility}} of the loading area, especially when tower cranes are employed. The <b>banksman</b> {{is in charge of}} the crane movements from the point of loading and unloading. They may use a system of hand signals or a radio link.|$|E
50|$|In British civil engineering, a <b>banksman</b> is {{the person}} who directs the {{operation}} of a crane or larger vehicle from the point near where loads are attached and detached. The term 'dogman' may be used in Australia and New Zealand, while 'spotter' is the more common term in United States.|$|E
50|$|Self-dumping grabs {{also have}} a single {{supporting}} rope or chain. The lower girder contains a linkage mechanism with hooks which connect to the upper girder, holding the grab closed. When the grab is lowered onto the spoil, weights release the hooks and allow the grab to open when lifted. A lever may also be fitted {{to this type of}} mechanism to which a long trip rope can be attached which, when pulled by a <b>banksman,</b> releases the catches in the mechanism and allows the grab to open in mid air (e.g. above a lorry or a hopper). The grab usually is fitted with a hydraulic damper to restrict the speed of opening. The clamshell bucket on the left hand side of the photograph on this page at Cardiff is a self-dumping chain grab.|$|E
50|$|The 5 September 1922 {{explosion}} {{was caused}} by a pocket of gas being ignited. The day before, gas had been reported in the Six Quarters Seam of the mine, and the deputy in charge, William Weightman, descended to assess the situation with a shot-firer. Weightman approved the shot-firer to go ahead and deploy his shot which ignited the gas in that area of the mine. Just before 9:00 am, the <b>banksman</b> of the mine noted a cloud of dust rising up No. 4 shaft and Mines rescue were called out. In all, 39 men died in the explosion with all bodies being recovered by 10 September. Identification of the bodies was difficult because of damage to the miners faces; one had to be identified by his belt and trousers because his face was so disfigured.|$|E
5000|$|These had a {{slightly}} different use, being more of a system for ensuring the correct pay by 'checking' {{in and out of}} the workplace prior to machines being produced for this specific purpose. 'Checks' were often 'holed' for hanging on boards. In mining, for example, a number on the check was personal to each miner and prior to going down the pit, the miner would give one of his tallies to the pit head [...] "banksman", keeping the duplicate for the duration of the shift. Upon returning to the surface, the miner gave his personal tally to the <b>banksman</b> who would pass it on to the time office or the lamp room. This system made it possible to keep track on workers' whereabouts in the mine complex and for what periods they were working.|$|E
50|$|Some {{or other}} {{commission}} had criticized mine managements for employing {{large numbers of}} unskilled whites 'often entirely ignorant of mining, and whose principal and often only recommendation is their physical fitness and their suitability for rough work'. Yet when the commission reported in 1910, it submitted draft regulations that were heavy with colour bars. Some appeared {{in the interpretation of}} terms, as when the words 'white person' were inserted in the definition of <b>banksman,</b> onsetter, ganger and mine manager. Some took the form of an injunction to employ only whites in specified occupations, such as blasting, running elevators, driving engines, supervising boilers and other machinery; or as shift boss and mine overseer. Furthermore, only whites would be allowed to obtain the certificates of competence required, for instance, by engine drivers and boiler attendants. With some modifications, these draft regulations served as model for the MINES & WORKS REGULATIONS ACT of 1912.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in 1918, in the small railway village of Westhouses, near Alfreton in Derbyshire, {{the son of a}} former dining car {{attendant}} and then colliery <b>banksman,</b> Gordon Warwick. He attended the Railway School there, only about 100 yards from his home, and then went to Tapton Hall Grammar School, winning prizes every year, and eventually going to Bristol University in 1936, becoming the first person from the village to go to University, with a teaching scholarship from Derbyshire County Council. He left Bristol with a First in Geography and immediately volunteered for army service, upon declaration of War in 1939. After about 6 months in the Army Reserve he was accepted for officer training, mostly in Yorkshire and on Salisbury Plain and spent the early part of his army career as an instructor. He spent much of the later years of the war in Tunisia, Algeria and Italy, mostly as a sound ranger, progressing to the rank of Captain and was awarded an MBE. He was in charge of Serbian prisoners of war at Cesena and prior to demobilization he spent time teaching at the Army Formation College at Perugia.|$|E
50|$|The Afon Clun {{marks the}} {{southern}} edge of the South Wales Coalfield. There are several former collieries {{to the north of the}} river. Many pits were begun in the 1860s in Beddau, Ty'n-y-nant and Gelynog pits being the most important, prior to which the area was mostly farmland. Cwm Colliery was sunk by the Great Western Colliery Company Limited in 1909 and this marked a rapid expansion of the population. In 1923 the Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Company sunk the Ynysmaerdy Colliery at Llantrisant, also known as the New Duffryn and Llantrisant Colliery, it had three shafts, employing 216 men. The Cwm was acquired by Powell Duffryn in 1928. In 1931 an underground railway linked the Cwm to the Maritime Colliery, Pontypridd and by 1934 the Cwm employed 100 men on the surface and 780 men underground. A methane gas explosion on bank holiday Monday, 2 June 1941, killed four men — Ernest Evans (<b>Banksman),</b> Noah Fletcher (Winding Engineman), John Gregor (Manager), and David Thomas (Switchboard Attendant) — and destroyed most of the surface buildings. The explosion would have caused far greater loss of life had it not occurred on a bank holiday. The colliery never reopened after the accident.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The overall {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to identify and catalogue the numerous managerial strategies for effective management of health and safety on a confined, urban, construction site. Design/Methodology/Approach: This is achieved by utilising individual interviews, focus groups discussion on selected case studies of confined construction sites, coupled with a questionnaire survey. Findings: The top five key strategies include (1) Employ safe system of work plans to mitigate personnel health and safety issues; (2) Inform personnel, before starting on-site, of the potential issues using site inductions; (3) Effective communication among site personnel; (4) Draft and implement an effective design site layout prior to starting on-site; and (5) Use of <b>banksman</b> (traffic co-ordinator) to segregate personnel from vehicular traffic. Practical Implication: The construction sector {{is one of the leading}} industries in accident causation and with the continued development and regeneration of our urban centres, confined site construction is quickly becoming the norm - an environment which only fuels accident creation within the construction sector. Originality/Value: This research aids on-site management that requires direction and assistance in the identification and implementation of key strategies for the management of health and safety, particularly in confined construction site environments. </span...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to identify and catalogue the numerous managerial strategies for effective management of health and safety on a confined, urban, construction site. A mixed methods methodology was adopted using interviews and focus group discussions on three selected case studies of confined construction sites. In addition to these, a questionnaire survey was used based on the findings from the interviews and the focus group discussions. The top five key strategies include (1) Employ safe system of work plans to mitigate personnel health and safety issues; (2) Inform personnel, before starting on-site, of the potential issues using site inductions; (3) Effective communication among site personnel; (4) Draft and implement an effective design site layout prior to starting on-site; and (5) Use of <b>banksman</b> (traffic co-ordinator) to segregate personnel from vehicular traffic.

40|$|Purpose – Construction {{plant and}} {{equipment}} harbour significant health and safety hazards. One particular item, the mini-excavator, presents a hazard from its inherent instability and tendency to overturn during use. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate turnover incidents to observe prominent factors and contribute to development of best practice guidance for improving health and safety relating to mini-excavator use. Design/methodology/approach – Comprehensive documentary data from eight case study incidents, along with anecdotal data from a further three, were qualitatively analysed in terms of: machine weight, machine activity, ground type/topography, operator competence, type of overturn, damage to property, and injury to person(s). Results were presented to experts in the field for comment and conclusions/recommendations accordingly developed. Findings – Observed prominent casual factors include: inadequate assessment of risk and non-adherence to safe working practice, working on poor ground, and working on inclined surfaces. The use of sealed operator cabs and proprietary seat restraint mechanisms seem to mitigate risk of personal injury to operators during overturn incidents. A need for cyclic training to reiterate good operator and <b>banksman</b> practice is emphasised, while construction managers should also be aware of the risks, and help implement risk controls. Research limitations/implications – Findings will inform construction plant management research generally, and the subject of mechanised workplace transport stability specifically. Practical implications – Best practice protocol will inform health and safety management of mini-excavators at the workplace. Originality/value – Academic research into mini-excavator stability is embryonic; this paper furthers evolving knowledge in the field...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{investigated the}} current inadequate holistic training practices given to tower crane operators which significantly impact {{health and safety}} in Gauteng, South African construction projects. The primary motivation for conducting the research was due to tower crane related accidents, fatalities and related project delays which have become endemic in the construction industry. These occurrences have not been researched {{from the perspective of}} the basic training given to tower crane operators in the SA construction industry. The study sought to examine the current structure and characteristics of the training programmes used in developing the skills of tower crane operators. This included exploring the current barriers and the effectiveness experienced in the training programmes given to tower crane operators. The study also sought to find the major improvements or restructuring that is still needed in skills development and training of tower crane operators from the perspective of tower crane operators. It consisted of a sample of 25 tower crane operators trained in various skills development programmes used in the South African construction industry. The research also included interviews from 9 site foremen and managers who manage the operations of tower cranes during construction project delivery, who also provided key data in relation to the training practices of tower crane operators from the manner in which their contractors conduct them. The study found several major factors contributing to inadequate holistic training of tower crane operators related to the following: the manner in which the current training programmes were structured in terms of theoretical and practical training; lack of effectiveness of the training programmes in terms of safety, communication, rigging and hoisting and the important knowledge of tower crane operations; inefficiency of tower cranes in terms of the technological aspects that relate to giving a clearer site view of the environment in which lifting and unloading of construction materials was conducted; inadequately trained <b>banksman</b> or signalers and lack of training in general personalities needed in operating tower cranes as the main contributing factors. These major factors that the study found to contribute to tower crane related accidents need to be addressed if the continuing accidents and fatalities are to be significantly reduced in Gauteng, South African construction projects during project delivery and execution...|$|E
