40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{delivery of}} provincial budgets in Ontario and Quebec this spring provided a useful {{chance to see}} how governments of two key provinces faced with similar challenges are responding. The focus of budgets, and commentary on them, tends to be forward-looking. But before putting faith in the forward-looking elements, budget-watchers should ask what this year's numbers reveal about the reliability of <b>budget</b> <b>commitments</b> in the past. The short answer is that, in recent years, one-year-ahead budgetary spending forecasts {{have been much more}} reliable in Quebec than in Ontario. Over the past decade, both provinces have tended to spend more than projected. While Quebec’s record has improved to the point where its citizens can have some confidence that this year’s <b>budget</b> <b>commitments</b> are serious, Ontario continues to overrun its commitments by large margins. Ontarians are therefore entitled to take their government’s latest promise to control spending with a large grain of salt.

Local government's debt policy is modeled as {{the outcome of}} a two-period game between three agents: central government, local government, and a bureau which produces services on behalf of local government. A key assumption of the model is that neither central nor local government is able to undertake long-term <b>budget</b> <b>commitments.</b> Two rationales are found for central regulations. First, local government is prevented from using deficits strategically to extract higher grants from central authorities. Second, the debt limit gives credibility to local government's budget policy towards the bureau. ...|$|E

40|$|Governments {{around the}} world have {{struggled}} to find the right method of controlling public spending and budget deficits. In recent years, the United States has evaluated policy changes using a ten-year budget window. The use of a multi-year window is intended to capture the future effects of policies, the notion being that a budget window that is too short permits the shifting of costs beyond the window's endpoint. But a budget window that is too long includes future years for which current legislation is essentially meaningless, and gives credit to fiscal burdens shifted to those whom the budget rules are supposed to protect. This suggests that there may be an "optimal"budget window, and seeking to understand its properties is one of this paper's main objectives. Another objective is to understand a phenomenon that has grown in importance in U. S. legislation [...] the "sunset.

40|$|Prior to September 11 th – {{the date}} {{by which we}} now frame discussions – debates around missile defence, whether {{national}} or transnational, were framed around two central points: what I call the ‘can it work’ and ‘should we or should we not do it’ debates. In regards to the first debate, the questions have been around the technological feasibility of a ballistic missile defence system. With one side arguing that it can in fact work if the commitment {{of time and money}} is put in, and the other side arguing that not only will the cost be prohibitive, but more importantly, the technological capabilities are not available even if the <b>budget</b> <b>commitments</b> are. Moreover, the time frame of putting in place even a limited ballistic missile defence system – a minimum of ten years but most likely in the 20 - 25 year range – undermines the stated urgency of the program (Folger 2001; Sirak 2001). The second debate, while concerned with the technological feasibility of missile defence, has been more focussed on the ‘politics’ of ballistic missile defence with the central questions being whether or not the threat of missile attack by ‘rogue’ states is indeed real or sufficient enough to warrant the construction of a defence shield (Harvey 2000; Mutimer 2001). This debate has also raised questions concerning what the effects will be as a consequence of proceeding to a missile defence program, with the potential of setting off an international arms race with China and Russia at the forefront...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} budgetary participation on departmental performance via <b>budget</b> adequacy, organisational <b>commitment</b> and role ambiguity. The responses of 108 budget preparers and budget users drawn from a cross-section of Malaysian local authorities, to a questionnaire survey were analysed by using mediation analysis, path analysis and Pearson Product-Moment Correlation technique. The results suggest that <b>budget</b> adequacy, organisational <b>commitment,</b> and role ambiguity are important links in the process. The {{results of this study}} suggest that the relationship between budget participation and departmental performance is statistically, significantly, positively and marginally correlated. Of more interest was the finding that <b>budget</b> adequacy, organisational <b>commitment,</b> and role ambiguity are important intervening variables in the relationship between budget participation and departmental performance. The test for mediation effect, demonstrated that <b>budget</b> adequacy, organisational <b>commitment,</b> and role ambiguity had partially mediated the relationship of budget participation and departmental performance. These three variables act as partial mediators when they significantly reduced or decreased the path coefficient of budget participation and departmental performance rather than eliminating the relationship. Furthermore, the test for direct and indirect effect of budget participation on departmental performance, suggests that budget participation predicted or affected departmental performance more strongly in the indirect way than it did in a direct way. This suggests that, even though the correlation between budget participation and departmental performance was significant, the path interpretation suggests that the correlation arose because budget participation was correlated with other variables that have direct effect upon departmental performance not budget participation itself directly predicted departmental performance. Therefore, there is enough evidence to suggest that budget participation of budget preparers and budget users affects departmental performance of Malaysian local authorities indirectly via <b>budget</b> adequacy, organisational <b>commitment</b> and role ambiguity. Among the indirect effects, the link between budget participation, <b>budget</b> adequacy, organisational <b>commitment,</b> role ambiguity and departmental performance may be the most important in term of this study’s contribution. The decomposition of the observed correlation between budget participation, <b>budget</b> adequacy, organisational <b>commitment</b> and role ambiguity showed that budget 3 participation of budget preparers and budget users of Malaysian local authorities in the budget setting has direct effect on <b>budget</b> adequacy, organisational <b>commitment</b> and role ambiguity. Budget adequacy and organisational commitment was directly related. However, the relationship of role ambiguity and organisational commitment in this study was indirectly related. This suggests that participation of budget preparers and budget users in the budget setting of Malaysian local authorities lead to decrease role ambiguity that provide adequate budgetary supports, which lead to increase organisational commitment and thus enhance departmental performance. In relation to the strength of the relationships of the variables undertaken for the study, the overall relationships between variables are significant and positively related except that of role ambiguity relationship. The relationships of role ambiguity with budget participation, budget adequacy, organisational performance and departmental performance are negatively related.
