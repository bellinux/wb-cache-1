5000|$|<b>Bill</b> <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> (B&K or BAK),also {{known as}} net payment zero (NPZ), is a pricing {{arrangement}} for the interconnection (direct or indirect) of two telecommunications networks {{under which the}} reciprocal call termination charge is zero.

50|$|<b>Bill</b> <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> {{represents}} a modern approach to interconnection charging {{in which the}} networks recover their costs only from their own customers {{rather than from the}} sending network.

50|$|In the European mobile {{telecommunications}} sector, absent a <b>bill</b> <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> arrangement, the wholesale markets have traditionally applied the calling party pays (CPP) principle {{in which an}} originating network pays the terminating network a charge called the mobile termination rate (MTR) or fixed termination rate (FTR) for calls to the terminating network. The MTRs paid under the CPP model, therefore, act as a cost floor to the retail pricing, preventing lowering of prices and innovation of retail propostitions. In many countries including the UK, the CPP model has thus led to {{a high level of}} regulatory activity aimed at capping the MTRs at a competitive level, which inevitably acts to reinforce the cost floor rather than being pro-competitive.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{proposes a}} single {{approach}} to interconnection pricing called Central Office <b>Bill</b> <b>and</b> <b>Keep</b> (2 Ì 2 COBAK 2 Ì 7), which applies to {{both local and}} long-distance traffic. COBAK is a default interconnection regime, which means it would apply only when two networks cannot agree on terms for interconnection. The COBAK proposal, as applied to local calls between two networks, consists of two rules. First, a called party 2 Ì 7 s carrier cannot charge an interconnecting carrier to terminate a call. (Thus, each carrier recovers {{the cost of the}} loop and switch that serves the loop primarily from its own end-user customers). Second, the calling party 2 Ì 7 s network is responsible for the cost of transporting a call between the calling party 2 Ì 7 s central office and the called party 2 Ì 7 s central office. These rules are easily extended to long-distance calls or other calls involving three or more networks. COBAK will solve or ameliorate many of the significant problems that plague the existing interconnection regimes...|$|E
40|$|With {{competition}} in telecommunications markets a carrier relies on competing networks to complete inter-network calls originated by its customers. Regulators typically require the calling partyâs network {{to pay a}} termination fee to the called partyâs network equal to the terminating networkâs âincremental cost â of completing the call. The payments for such âtermination services â could affect retail prices and therefore consumption of telecommunications services. I show that when both parties to a call benefit from it, they should bear {{the costs of the}} call in proportion to the value that they receive from the call. This implies that requiring two networks to exchange traffic at specific points on a <b>bill</b> <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> basis can generate more efficient network utilization than imposing all costs on the calling partyâs network. This occurs even with unbalanced traffic between the two networks. Thus, regulators may be able to improve the efficiency of telecommunications markets by establishing inter-carrier compensation rules that cause the calling party and the called party to share the cost of a call. *The opinions in this paper do not necessarily represent the views of the Federal Trade Commission or an...|$|E
40|$|Historically, {{interconnection}} in {{the world}} of the Internet has been approached significantly differently from interconnection in the fixed Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and the mobile Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN). As fixed and mobile networks evolve to Next Generation Networks (NGNs) based on the Internet Protocol (IP), it becomes increasingly necessary to merge these perspectives in order to achieve a unified and integrated approach to network interconnection. There is a rich history of economic analysis of IP-based and of conventional switched networks that began to converge early in this decade. In 2008, this issue is coming to a boil, as regulators seek to provide regulatory certainty for the build-out of NGNs, even in the face of substantial uncertainties, and even though practical experience with NGNs is still in a very preliminary state.

40|$|In many {{countries}} {{there is widespread}} concern {{at the level of}} mobile termination charges. This is attributable to the bottleneck monopoly created by the Calling Party Pays (CPP) principle. It has led to increasingly severe price controls on termination charges. Regulatory experience in the three foremost such countries (UK, Australia and New Zealand) suggests that price controls are of limited effectiveness in aligning termination charges with costs, that net welfare gains from controls are small and that costs of setting controls are high. The Receiving Party Pays (RPP) principle, which applies in North America and several Asian countries, avoids the bottleneck monopoly problem. After allowing for various economic and technical average revenue (price) per call is significantly lower with RPP, average minutes of usage per subscriber are significantly higher and the mobile penetration rate is not significantly different. Handset subsidies seem to be lower in the US (with RPP) than in the UK (with CPP). Surprisingly, CPP regulators have either ignored RPP or rejected it for various alleged disadvantages. These do not withstand investigation. However, in CPP countries there is still concern about the idea of paying to receive calls. There is a way to get the benefits associated with RPP without this disadvantage. RPP is based on a 'bill and keep' regime. Some mobile operators in RPP countries are now offering customers the option of calling plans with free incoming calls. Changing to a 'bill and keep' regime would avoid the bottleneck monopoly and associated distortions of conventional CPP regimes, yet enable operators and customers themselves to choose how to pay for calls [...] in effect, to choose between CPP and RPP.
