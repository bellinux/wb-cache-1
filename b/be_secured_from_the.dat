6000|$|The {{terms of}} this {{proposition}} are easy; yet if it will help, I will speak {{a word or two}} for explication. First. By a sinner, I mean one that has transgressed the law; 'for sin is the transgression of the law' (1 John 3:4). Second. By the curse of the law, I mean that sentence, judgment, or condemnation which the law pronounceth against the transgressor (Gal 3:10). Third. By justifying righteousness, I mean that which stands in the doing and suffering of Christ {{when he was in the}} world (Rom 5:19). Fourth. By the residing of this righteousness in Christ's person, I mean it still abides with him as to the action, though the benefit is bestowed upon those that are his. Fifth. By the imputation of it to us, I mean God's making of it ours by an act of his grace, that we by it might <b>be</b> <b>secured</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> curse of the law. Sixth. When I say there is no other way to be justified. I cast away TO THAT END the law, and all the works of the law as done by us.[2] ...|$|E

60|$|First, Prithee when didst thou {{begin to}} be righteous? Was it before or after thou hadst been a sinner? Not afore, I dare say; but if after, then the sins that thou pollutedst thyself withal before, have made thee uncapable of acting legal righteousness. For sin, where it is, pollutes, defiles, and makes vile the whole man; {{therefore}} thou canst not by after acts of obedience make thyself just {{in the sight of}} that God thou pretended now to stand praying unto. Indeed, thou mayest cover thy dirt, and paint thy sepulchre; for that acts of after obedience will do, though sin has gone before. But Pharisee, God can see through the white of this wall, even to the dirt that is within: God also can see through the paint and garnish of thy beauteous sepulchre, to the dead men's bones that are within; nor can any of thy most holy duties, nor all, when put together, blind the eye of the all-seeing majesty from beholding all the uncleanness of thy soul.13 (Matt 23:27) Stand not therefore so stoutly to it, now thou art before God; sin is with thee, and judgment and justice is before him. It becomes thee, therefore, rather to despise and abhor this life of thy hand, and to count all thy doings but dross and dung, and to be content to be justified with another's righteousness instead of thine own. This is the way to be secured. I say, blind Pharisee, {{this is the way to}} <b>be</b> <b>secured</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wrath which is to come.|$|E
6000|$|Second, The Father's {{giving of}} them to him to save them, {{declares}} unto us that he is and will be faithful in his office of Mediator, and that therefore they shall <b>be</b> <b>secured</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fruit and wages of their sins, which is eternal damnation, by his faithful execution of it. And, indeed, it is said, even by the Holy Ghost himself, That he [...] "was faithful to him that appointed him," [...] that is, to this work of saving those that the Father hath given him for that purpose; as [...] "Moses was faithful in all his house." [...] Yea, and more faithful too, for Moses was faithful in God's house but as a servant; [...] "but Christ as a Son over his own house" [...] (Heb 3). And therefore this man is counted worthy of more glory than Moses, even upon this account, because more faithful than he, as well as because of the dignity of his person. Therefore in him, and in his truth and faithfulness, God resteth well pleased, and hath put all the government of this people upon his shoulders. Knowing that nothing shall be wanting in him, that may any way perfect this design. And of this he, to wit, the Son, hath already given a proof. For when the time was come, that his blood was, by Divine justice, required for their redemption, washing, and cleansing, he as freely poured {{it out of his}} heart, {{as if it had been}} water out of a vessel; not sticking to part with his own life, that the life which was laid up for his people in heaven might not fail to be bestowed upon them. And upon this account, as well as upon any other, it is that God calleth him [...] "my righteous servant" [...] (Isa 53:11). For his righteousness could never have been complete, if he had not been to the uttermost faithful to the work he undertook; it is also, because he is faithful and true, that in righteousness he doth judge and make work for his people's deliverance. He will faithfully perform this trust reposed in him. The Father knows this, and hath therefore given his elect unto him.|$|E
