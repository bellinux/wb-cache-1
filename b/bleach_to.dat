5|$|The Stresemann's bushcrow (Zavattariornis stresemanni), {{also known}} as Abyssinian pie, bush crow, Ethiopian bushcrow, or by its generic name Zavattariornis, is a rather starling-like bird, which is {{currently}} thought to be member of the crow family, Corvidae, though this is uncertain. It is slightly larger than the North American blue jay and is a bluish-grey in overall colour which becomes almost white on the forehead. The throat and chest are creamy-white with the tail and wings a glossy black. The black feathers {{have a tendency to}} <b>bleach</b> <b>to</b> brown at their tips. The iris of the bird is brown and the eye is surrounded by a band of naked bright blue skin. The bill, legs, and feet are black.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybe pseudoaztecorum, {{found in}} India, differs from P.aztecorum in the {{morphology}} of the pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia. The characteristic filamentous neck {{present in the}} cystidia of P.aztecorum is absent in P.pseudoaztecorum. P.pseudoaztecorum had been previously described by K.Natarajan and N.Raman as P.aztecorum, but they published the taxon with a new name after consultation with Guzmán. Fresh specimens of P.aztecorum resemble P.pelliculosa, but this latter species is found only in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada. Like P.aztecorum, the caps of the South African species P.natalensis also <b>bleach</b> <b>to</b> nearly white when dried. The closely related P.baeocystis also bleaches in color to white when dry. Found in northwest North America from British Columbia to Washington and Oregon, P.baeocystis has thinner cheilocystidia than P.aztecorum (typically measuring 20–32 by 4.4–6μm) and its pleurocystidia, when present, are found only near the gill edge. P.quebecensis, known only from Quebec, Canada, has pleurocystidia measuring 12–25 by 5–10μm. Although the phylogeny of the species comprising section Aztecorum is not known with certainty, Guzmán has suggested that P.aztecorum was the ancestor of P.baeocystis in northwestern North America and of P.quebecensis in northeastern North America.|$|E

25|$|Maimonides {{taught that}} techelet refers to wool dyed light blue, {{the color of}} the sky {{opposite}} the sun on a clear day. The term refers to a specific dye, and use of any other dye is unfit even though it is sky-blue in color. The techelet of tzitzit is dyed by soaking wool in lime. Afterwards, it is taken and washed until it is clean and then boiled with <b>bleach</b> <b>to</b> prepare it to accept the dye. They take the blood of a chilazon fish, found in the Mediterranean Sea, whose color is like {{the color of the}} sea and whose blood is black like ink, and place the blood in a pot together with herbs, boil it, and insert the wool until it becomes sky-blue. Maimonides taught that one may buy techelet from an outlet that has established a reputation for authenticity without question, and one may rely on its reputation until a reason for suspicion arises. When a garment is entirely red, green, or any other color other than white, its white strands should be made from the same color as the garment itself. If the garment is techelet, its white strands should be made from any color other than black.|$|E

David Tennant liked Davros' [...] "Hitlerian megalomaniac" [...] attitude and the nostalgic feeling he created—Tennant's first memory of Doctor Who was Davros' debut in Genesis of the Daleks—and described himself as being [...] "absolutely captivated by [...] extraordinary creature". To prepare for his role, Bleach reviewed Genesis of the Daleks, one of his favourite serials, to remind himself of Davros' voice. Bleach described his interpretation of Davros as that of [...] " [...] twisted megalomaniac, [...] mad scientist, [...] misguided genius" [...] {{at the same time and}} described the character as a whole as [...] "a cross between Hitler and Stephen Hawking" [...] whose [...] "nihilistic desires" [...] made the character [...] "extraordinary".

50|$|Light skinned is {{frequently}} marketed via billboards and posters that feature light skinned models, {{playing on the}} public perception that looking multiracial or having lighter skin makes one more attractive. Some Ghanians also believe that if a lighter-skinned person {{is in a position}} of power, that they <b>bleached</b> <b>to</b> get into that position and is <b>bleaching</b> <b>to</b> maintain it. Historians such as Jemima Pierre theorize that the desire for lighter colored skin stem from apartheid and the British colonization of West Africa. White skin asserted class privilege and distinct racial privilege, prompting many Ghanians <b>to</b> <b>bleach</b> their skin <b>to</b> achieve a similar color. Over time this also became a major determinant of beauty, especially among Ghanian women, and by the 1980s skin bleaching had spread throughout all socioeconomic classes of women. Despite being a common practice among Ghanians, lower class people are often openly ridiculed for skin bleaching. Blacks who bleach their skin (regardless of socioeconomic status) are often ridiculed for aspiring and ultimately failing to become white.|$|R
