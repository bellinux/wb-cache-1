40|$|International audienceThis study {{evaluated}} {{the relation between}} the citrus <b>bud</b> <b>mite</b> [Aceria sheldoni (Ewing) ] and lemon trees [(Citrus limon (L.) Burm] in two groves, over two seasons in Reggio Calabria (Italy). Random samples of shoots were taken every 10 days and the number of buds, blossoms, fruits, and leaves present on each shoot were counted. Blossoms and fruits were classified as healthy or deformed and the immature and adults stages of the citrus <b>bud</b> <b>mite</b> and associated predatory mites were counted. Observational data indicated that the citrus <b>bud</b> <b>mite</b> does not have a negative influence on the lemon harvest and that the interaction between its populations and the host plant is a mutual symbiosis in which mite populations use the buds as a resource and repay the host plant by positively regulating its productive system. In both lemon groves, three stigmaeid mites [Zetzellia mali (Ewing), Z. graeciana Gonzalez and Agistemus collyerae Gonzalez] were also collected and their density was compared with that of the A. sheldoni. Our study highlights the complexity of relations of the citrus <b>bud</b> <b>mite</b> and lemon trees, and stresses the importance of carefully determining the real influence of the citrus <b>bud</b> <b>mite</b> on host plant harvests...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- Short Shoot Syndrome (SSS) causes severe {{crop losses}} in Oregon {{vineyards}} due to bunch necrosis {{during the early}} part of the season. Other symptoms include malformed leaves, unusually short and angled shoots, scar tissue and bronzed leaves close to harvest time. This work shows that SSS found in Ore-gon vineyards is closely associated with grape leaf rust mite, Calepitrimerus vitis (Nalepa) infestations. Very few <b>bud</b> <b>mites,</b> Colomerus vitis (Pagenstecher), were found in the vineyards during the current year and no relationship could be found between SSS symptoms and this species. During winter, rust mites are dormant and no evidence of direct bud damage from rust mites was found inside undeveloped buds. Tissue damage from mites was first observed between bud break and the two-leaf stage in mite infested vineyards. Rust mite colonies were found under outer bud scales and bark of canes close to the buds. Crop losses as high as 23. 7 % were directly linked to rust mite infestations and SSS from several vineyards sampled in Ore-gon...|$|R
40|$|The {{eriophyid}} mite Calepitrimerus vitis is {{a common}} pest in many vineyards in Hungary. Deutogynes (winter-form) of Calepitrimerus vitis in the vineyards of Szekszárd emerge from their overwintering sites in spring. Protogynes (summer-form) start to appear {{at the beginning of}} May, replacing deutogynes gradually. The process lasts until the end of May when the deutogynes disappear. The mite population increases slightly during the summer months. In August a rapid increase occurs. The maximum density of mites is reached at the middle of August or at the beginning of September, when the first deutogynes appear. The mite density declines in September rapidly and it is very low in October. The hibernation shelters are in the buds and at the cane base with the 2 year old wood. The most females are found at the cane base and in buds 1 – 4. In upper <b>buds</b> <b>mite</b> density gradually declines. A washing technique is described to estimate the population of Calepitrimerus vitis and useful for sampling of eriophyid mites either in summer or winter...|$|R

By February 2007, large commercial migratory beekeepers wintering in California, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas had reported heavy losses associated with CCD.

40|$|Eriophyoid big <b>bud</b> <b>mites</b> are key pests of {{hazelnuts}} {{throughout the}} world, although {{little is known}} of the identity and impact of the species on New Zealand hazelnut crops. The key objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the species of mite present on New Zealand crops, explore a method of monitoring mite emergence from overwintering big buds, determine the phenology of mites in relation to tree phenology and weather, and identify the optimum timing for control measures. The presence of both Phytoptus avellanae (Nalepa 1889) (Acari: Phytoptidae) and Cecidophyopsis vermiformis (Nalepa 1889) (Acari: Eriophyidae) was confirmed, the latter species being a new record for New Zealand. Preliminary diagnostic DNA sequences were determined for both species. A sticky band technique was developed to monitor mite emergence from overwintering big <b>buds,</b> and <b>mite</b> emergence was found to occur between early and late spring. Mite emergence and movement occurred when daily temperatures were greater than 15 degrees C and when mean temperatures were greater than 9 degrees C, with mite emergence increasing with temperature. It proved difficult to relate the phenology of hazelnut to mite emergence, however, the development of new <b>buds</b> during <b>mite</b> emergence was a crucial factor in the infestation of new buds. An accumulated heat sum model (DD), started at Julian date 152 and using a lower threshold temperature of 6 degrees C, predicted the onset of emergence on two cultivars and at two sites as occurring at approximately 172 DD. A regression model based on leaf number, bud height, bud width, DD and Julian date provided a more satisfactory prediction of percent accumulated mite emergence. It is recommended both peak mite emergence and the appearance of hazelnut buds should be used to optimise the time to apply control measures. Therefore, a control should be applied before buds measure 0. 5 x 0. 5 mm (width x height), are enclosed within the axil, and have a rounded tip, or, when 50 % accumulated mite emergence has occurred, which ever occurs first. A preliminary field experiment tested the application of sulphur (40 g/ 10 litres of 800 g/kg No Fungus Super Sulphur) at 2, 50 and 80 % accumulated mite emergence. The greatest reduction in mite numbers was achieved with an application at approximately 50 % emergence. Considerable variation in mite emergence occurred between years, therefore optimum timing of controls would need to be determined by monitoring <b>mites,</b> new <b>buds</b> and weather conditions each year. Field collection of mites also identified the presence of Typhlodromus doreenae Schicha (Acari: Phytoseiidae) which would warrant further study for inclusion in an integrated mite control programme...|$|R
