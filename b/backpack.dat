5|$|Loitering weapons first {{emerged in}} the 1980s {{for use in the}} Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role against surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs), and were deployed for the SEAD role in a number of military forces in the 1990s. Starting in the 2000s, loitering weapons have been developed for additional roles ranging from relatively long-range strikes and fire support down to tactical, very short range battlefield systems that fit in a <b>backpack.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rolling <b>backpacks</b> are <b>backpacks</b> with {{wheels on}} the bottom and an {{extending}} handle. Because of their design, rolling <b>backpacks</b> reduce the strain on the user, though the shoulder straps may be used to carry the pack for short distances when the terrain is not suitable for wheels. Rolling <b>backpacks</b> are most commonly used while traveling by airplane or train.|$|R
50|$|Terms used to {{describe}} <b>backpacking</b> with more money and resources include flashpacking, a combination of flash, as in fancy, with <b>backpacking,</b> and poshpacking, a combination of posh, an informal adjective for upper class, and <b>backpacking.</b>|$|R

5|$|Starting in the 2000s, {{loitering}} {{weapons have}} been developed for additional roles beyond the initial SEAD role ranging from relatively long-range strikes and fire support down to tactical, very short-range battlefield use such as the AeroVironment Switchblade which is deployed at the platoon level and fits in a <b>backpack.</b> A documented use of loitering munitions was in 2016 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes in which an IAI Harop was used against a bus functioning as a troop transport.|$|E
5|$|After a 40-day delay {{caused by}} faulty {{computer}} chips, Kvant-2 was launched on 26 November 1989. After problems deploying the craft's solar array {{and with the}} automated docking systems on both Kvant-2 and Mir, the new module was docked manually on 6 December. Kvant-2 added {{a second set of}} gyrodines to Mir, and brought the new life support systems for recycling water and generating oxygen, reducing dependence on ground resupply. The module featured a large airlock with a one-metre hatch. A special <b>backpack</b> unit (known as Ikar), an equivalent of the US Manned Maneuvering Unit, was located inside Kvant-2's airlock.|$|E
50|$|In 1913, the Norwegian Armed Forces bought Bergans <b>backpacks.</b> Explorers like Roald Amundsen, Lincoln Ellsworth and General Bruce from Mount Everest expeditions, used Bergans <b>backpacks.</b> This led to Bergans {{becoming}} world famous. Bergans <b>backpacks</b> {{participated in}} several World Exhibitions and won many awards. Bergans' design was originally patented in 22 countries and Bergans exported their <b>backpacks</b> to most {{countries in the}} world. In the mid-20th century the patent expired, and, with it, so did the most important protection. From that point on, anyone could copy and make <b>backpacks</b> with external support, and the international competition, including that from low-cost countries, became stronger.|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{large number}} of {{students}} tend to carry school <b>backpacks.</b> Carring heavy <b>backpacks</b> is increasingly putting the students at risk, and may cause long term damage to their growing body. This survey was conducted on Khorramabad primary school students to determine if their <b>backpacks</b> are too heavy and the methods of packing and wearing them, and history of back pain among them. Materials and Methods: This Cross – sectional Study included taking 1009 students, Weighting them and their <b>backpacks,</b> While asking about Packing and wearing methods {{and the history of}} back pain. Results: The results showed that <b>backpacks</b> were heavy in 57 / 8 % of the cases. 24 / 6 % had history of back pain and there were significant relationships between the carrying heavy <b>backpacks</b> and wearing them improperly, and the history of back pain. Conclusion: The main conclusion in this study was that many students are carrying heavy <b>backpacks</b> and packing and wearing them improperly which put them at risk of back pain and other complications...|$|R
5|$|The astronauts planned {{placement}} of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP) and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through Eagle twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60° field of view. Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System (PLSS). According to veteran Moon-walker John Young, a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS <b>backpack,</b> so {{some of the highest}} heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} {{brings in}} the need to rely upon native flora and fauna to survive. This is manifested in a stamina gauge, which constantly depletes during gameplay. Failure to restore the gauge by eating has detrimental effects on gameplay, such as decreasing Snake's ability to aim his weapon and being heard by the enemy due to Snake's loud stomach grumbles. Food {{can be stored in}} the <b>backpack</b> until it is needed. However, some types of food rot over time, and consuming rotten foods may result in Snake developing a stomach ache, causing the stamina gauge to deplete faster.|$|E
5|$|After Negron {{gets his}} damaged <b>backpack</b> radio working, the {{soldiers}} contact headquarters and {{are told to}} capture an enemy soldier. A local Partisan group arrives with a young German deserter, Hans Brundt, as their prisoner. Earlier, residents of the nearby village of Sant'Anna di Stazzema were killed by German forces following a betrayal by a partisan, named Rodolfo, who knows that Brundt can identify him as the traitor. After concealing the fact that German forces are approaching the village in a counterattack, Rodolfo kills Brundt and the Partisan leader before escaping. It is Rodolfo whom Negron will kill 39 years later. Captain Nokes arrives in the village to interrogate Brundt and finds him dead. The Americans prepare to leave the village ahead of a German counterattack, but Sam refuses to leave Angelo behind. After promising to court-martial all four soldiers, Nokes and his contingent drive out of town, but he is killed in the opening German offensive.|$|E

50|$|Returning {{features}} aside, Front Mission 4 has {{a number}} of new gameplay mechanics. Weapons are now capable of attacking more than once during any battle, provided that the unit initiating the attack has sufficient AP and weapon ammunition. The time of day affects a weapon's chances of hitting its target; for example, accuracy is lowered during night time. Weather conditions affect the effective range of weapons; for example, a blizzard will reduce a machine gun's maximum firing range by one square. Like in Front Mission Alternative, there are new auxiliary <b>backpacks</b> that offer unique features when used on the battlefield. In addition to the item, turbo, and repair <b>backpacks,</b> players can now use jetpacks, sensor <b>backpacks,</b> EMP <b>backpacks,</b> and radio <b>backpacks.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1972, a {{parallel}} <b>backpacking</b> program was started. <b>Backpacking</b> trips {{are similar to}} the canoeing trips, except that time spent on trail is typically 2-3 days shorter, due to the need for travel days to and from camp. <b>Backpacking</b> trips take place in the mountain ranges of Isle Royale, Wyoming, Montana, Utah, Idaho, Washington, Alberta, British Columbia, the Yukon, and Alaska.|$|R
5|$|Armstrong concluded: The {{responsibility}} for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and <b>backpack</b> that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We {{would like to give}} special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.|$|E
5|$|As {{the pairs}} go their {{separate}} ways, an enforcer for the loan shark {{catches up with}} the duplicated pair {{to get the money}} back and they discover they have no cash. The enforcer orders Brian to decide whether he kills him or Stewie. Brian initially refuses to choose but when he panics, he tells the enforcer to shoot Stewie in the head, killing him, then the enforcer tells Brian to give him the money he and Stewie borrowed and leaves the room. Meanwhile, the real pair worry about getting caught Stewie suggest that they make a run for it and head home, but Brian fears it will endanger the family. Stewie suggests that perhaps they should kill themselves and Brian reluctantly agrees. They prepare to throw themselves off the top balcony of the hotel but Stewie chickens out at the last second, leaving Brian to fall to his death. A panic-stricken Stewie trips over his <b>backpack</b> and finds the money the other pair had won.|$|E
5|$|Banjo-Kazooie {{is set in}} the Spiral Mountain {{and follows}} the story of Banjo, a male brown honey bear, and Kazooie, a female red-crested Breegull who is always kept in Banjo's <b>backpack.</b> The game begins when a foul-tempered witch named Gruntilda learns from her {{cauldron}} Dingpot that Tooty, Banjo's younger sister, is more beautiful than her.

Along the way, they are aided by Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman and Gruntilda's former teacher.|$|E
5000|$|Returning {{features}} aside, Scars of the War has {{a number}} of new gameplay mechanics, the most notable being friendly fire. Unlike other Front Mission titles, any units in a weapon's line of fire will be subject to being hit by its rounds. Each weapon class has a distinct firing path; for example, shotgun rounds spread in mid-flight and can hit units away from its firing path. Another new addition is part skills; parts can be equipped with special features that grant them unique properties. For example, rifles can shoot through multiple targets in its line of fire with the part skill [...] "Piercing". Auxiliary <b>backpacks</b> from Front Mission 4 that make a return include: item, turbo, repair, jetpack, sensor, and EMP <b>backpacks.</b> Several of the auxiliary <b>backpacks</b> have new functions: item <b>backpacks</b> come with a small increase in power output, sensor <b>backpacks</b> can use EMP, and EMP <b>backpacks</b> can add armor coats or repair damaged parts.|$|R

5|$|Duane Roger Morrison (July 23, 1953 – September 27, 2006) was {{eventually}} {{identified as the}} perpetrator of the incident. He was unemployed {{at the time of}} the hostage crisis, and had no known connection to Platte Canyon High School or any of the hostages. Initial reports of the gunman described him as a bearded 35-year-old man with a camouflage <b>backpack</b> and a black hooded sweatshirt.

5|$|Each module {{was fitted}} with {{external}} components {{specific to the}} experiments that were carried out within that module, the most obvious being the Travers antenna mounted to Priroda. This synthetic aperture radar consisted of a large dish-like framework mounted outside the module, with associated equipment within, used for Earth observations experiments, as was {{most of the other}} equipment on Priroda, including various radiometers and scan platforms. Kvant-2 also featured several scan platforms and was fitted with a mounting bracket to which the cosmonaut manoeuvring unit, or Ikar, was mated. This <b>backpack</b> was designed to assist cosmonauts in moving around the station and the planned Buran {{in a manner similar to}} the US Manned Maneuvering Unit, but it was only used once, during EO-5.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} the <b>backpacking</b> culture in Ecuador. It proposes a clarification {{of the issue}} and {{discusses the}} problem from two perspectives. Questions are raised about the <b>backpacking</b> identity, the <b>backpacking</b> travel style and how they use given facilities in the host country. The work focuses and analyses {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the destination through the lens of a backpacker. The empirical material is taken from intensive interviews conducted in Ecuador. A discussion reviews the <b>backpacking</b> identity, how and why backpackers travel; and the backpacker’s opinion about sustainable tourism in South America. In addition, the thesis concentrates on the travellers’ finances and how they prepare for an extended journey...|$|R
