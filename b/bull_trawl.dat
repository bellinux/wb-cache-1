As {{one of the fundamental}} problems on these subjects, it is necessary to clarify the acoustical features of the noises in the spaces where fishes are distributed, for example, the frequency distribution and the sound pressure of the underwater noises which are made by fishing boats and gear. Therefore the author has measured by the aid of the underwater tape-recorder the underwater noises in course of the fishing operation with the one-boat type trawl net, the <b>bull</b> <b>trawl</b> net, and the purse seine. The analytical results of the measurement are as follows: 1) The underwater noises measured in fishing with the three types of fishing gear were different from one another. The noise from the one-boat type trawl net was pulsating, whereas that from the <b>bull</b> <b>trawl</b> net was almost continuous. The noise from the purse seine was also continuous being similar to that from the <b>bull</b> <b>trawl</b> net, though its frequency band was narrower than that for both types of trawl nets. 2) The frequency distribution of the noise was DC to 5000 Hz in the case of both trawl nets, and DC to 3000 Hz {{in the case of the}} purse seine. The most predominant frequencies in these ranges were 500 Hz to 800 Hz in the case of the one-boat type trawl net, and 400 Hz to 600 Hz, somewhat lower though not so remarkable, in the case of the <b>bull</b> <b>trawl</b> net. In the case of the purse seine, on the other hand, any especially predominant frequency was not seen, but its peculiar noise of 5400 Hz to 6000 Hz caused by the friction of the purse ring against the purse wire was perceived in bracing the sinker side. 3) The acoustic comparison of the noises in fishing among the three type of netting gear showed that the engine noise was inaudible in the case of the one-boat type trawl net because of other noise, but was clearly perceived in the cases of the <b>bull</b> <b>trawl</b> net and the purse seine. 4) concerning the fish catch with the one-boat type trawl net in the East China Sea, the weight compositions of several useful species such as the drums (sciaenid fishes) were investigated. From the mean weight the resonance frequency of the air bladder was calculated and was revealed to almost correspond with the predominant frequency of the underwater noises given forth by the netting gear. In consequence, it is well considered that these underwater noise have significant influences on the perception and behavior of fish. トロール網,以西底曳網および旋網の操業中の水中騒音を録音分析し以下に示す結果を得た. 1) 測定を行なった両底曳網の水中騒音はトロール網の場合はパルス状であるのに対し以西底曳網はほとんど連続音であった. 旋網の場合は漁法上浮網形態で主に表層近くで用いられ網の海底との摩擦が少ないためエンジンノイズ,プロペラノイズが主でパターンとしては以西底曳網に似た連続音が主であった. 2) 周波数分布は両底曳網ではDC～ 5000 Hz,またはそれ以上広帯域におよんでおり,旋網の場合はDC～ 3000 Hzと両底曳網より狭い帯域範囲であった. また最も優勢な周波数はトロール網では 500 Hz～ 800 Hz(最大 37 dB),以西底曳網はトロール網ほど顕著ではないが 400 Hz～ 600 Hz(最大 30 dB),旋網に関しては優勢な周波数は認められなかった. しかし旋網特異の騒音として環と締括綱との網裾をしぼる時に摩擦音が 5400 Hz～ 6000 Hzの周波数帯域において確認された. 3) 録音の再生時における聴覚による比較では,トロール網の場合,自船のエンジンノイズは他の騒音が大きく認められなかった. これに反し以西底曳網の方はハイドロホンまでの自船からの水平距離がトロール網のそれの約 2 倍にもかかわらず明らかにエンジンノイズを認める事ができた. 旋網の騒音は集魚中,投揚網中共にエンジンノイズとプロペラノイズがほとんど全ての騒音であった. 4) 東支那海におけるトロール網の漁獲物中よりグチ,ニベ等有用魚種数種類の体重組成を測定し,その平均体重より「うきぶくろ」の共振周波数を算出した結果,網漁具の発する水中騒音の優勢な周波数とがほぼ一致した. この事から操業中の水中騒音が魚に対する知覚行動反応に有意的な影響を与えている事は充分考えられる...|$|E
40|$|There are {{number of}} unclearfied points {{regarding}} behaviour of <b>bull</b> <b>trawl</b> net. The present report therefore aims at presenting basic data on this. Author reports results of some measurement on the tension on <b>bull</b> <b>trawl</b> net and discuss {{them in this}} paper. Results obtained can be as follows; (1) In ordinary towing condition, tension on the lacing line of head rope side were 400 - 700 kg, that on lacing line of ground rope side were 680 - 1200 kg respectively. (2) In the case of trawling, boats were affected by wind and current from sideway, tension of lee side was 1. 5 - 2. 3 times of that of weather side. And then net shape seemed to be unbalanced and this might affect the fishing efficiency. (3) The plane shape of towing rope was made an approximation with an equation of caternary with weight as the net resistance on its top. The result of calculation showed the plane view of towing rope was almost straight line. 二そう曳網の漁具にかかる張力を測定してその動態について検討し次のような結果を得た。(1) 筋縄にかかる張力は通常ヘッドロープ側で 400 ~ 700 kg,グランドロープ側で 680 ~ 1200 kgであるが,曳網中に多量の入泥があった場合にはヘッドロープ側で 300 ~ 700 kg,グランドロープ側で 1200 ~ 1660 kgとなる。(2) 側方より風潮流をうけて曳網する場合は風下側の曳索が不足した形となり風下側の張力は風上側の 2. 2 ~ 3. 5 倍となり網成りも歪んでいるものと考えられる。(3) 曳索の水平形状について中央に網抵抗という重量物を付加した懸垂曲線で近似した結果その形状はほぼ直線となった。これは網抵抗が非常に大きいためと考えられる...|$|E
40|$|The ground ropes {{function}} {{is to keep the}} net in contact with the sea bottom, and herd fishes to the entrance of the bag net. In the case of thinking about selective fishing with a drag net, it is necessary to clarify the shape and herding function of the ground rope. But there are very few reports about it. In this paper, the author considered forces acting on the ground rope under towing conditions, and decided the shape of it analytically. The author designed a fish herding model the ground rope based on the theoretical probability of fiches entering the funnel of a net. Based on these results, the author investigated the shape and gear efficiency of the ground rope. Finally the author intended to obtain rational instructions for designing of ground rope. (1) The construction and weight distribution of three types of ground rope: Danish Seine, <b>Bull</b> <b>Trawl</b> and Trawl, (typical drag nets operated in Japan), were compared. Weight distribution of both Danich Seine and Trawl are uniform. But the mean weight of the later is much heavier than that of the former. It the case of comparison of Trawl and <b>Bull</b> <b>Trawl,</b> the former is long and increases its weight towards the middle. The latter is short and very heavy and shows little difference in its weight distribution. The difference in fishing methods are clearly influenced {{in the construction of the}} two types ground rope. (2) Three forces: hydraulic resistance of netting concentrated at the lacign line, hydraulic resistance of ground rope, and sliding frictional force between sea bottom are acting on the ground rope under towing conditions. At equilibrium those forces made a fixed ground rope shape. The author assumed the ground rope as a connection of segments, and considered an equlibrium among three components acting on them: horizontal, vertical and tangential components. In general it is impossible to express the vertical and horizontal component acting on each segment of the ground rope as a simple function. Assuming that the horizontal component acting on each segment of the ground rope is constant at any part, the length and end distances are known ahead of time, the shape of the ground rope was expressed graphically based on the distribution of vertical components of it which were obtained experimentaly. (3) The vertical component acting on each segment of the ground rope under towing conditions was expressed as the sum of hydraulic resistance, sliding frictional force and sand drag. Drag of clyinder type of bobbins at different lengths and that of sphere type of bobbins in various directions were measured both on wet concrete and in a sand tank with water. The drag of two types bobbin on a rocky bottom (F_D) had no directional qualities, and may be expressed as the product of weight of bobbin (W_B) and drag coefficient (μ_ 90); F_D=μ_ 90 W_B. The drag coefficient of cylinder type of bobbins and sphere type of bobbins were 0. 75 and 0. 68 respectively. The drag of cylinder type of bobbins in towed on a sandy bottom is dependent upon the on attack angle (90 °-θ), and may be expressed the product of the weight of bobbin (W_B) and drag coefficient (μθ) as follows; F_D=μθW_B. The drag coefficient is a function of θ　and is expressed as follows; μθ= 0. 68 (0. 72 sin^[1. 5]θ+cos^[1. 5]θ). In the case of a sphere, the drag coefficient was denoted a constant value of 0. 68. Hydraulic resistance of model ground rope composed of clyinder type of bobbins was measured in a circulating tank. Hydraulic drag coefficient (C_D) showed a constant value of about 0. 45. (4) Three types of model ground rope differing in weight distribution were made. These were examined both on wet concrete and sandy sea bottom under various conditions for the purpose of measuring shape and resistance. Close agreement was shown between experimental values of the shape and resistance of them, and those of calculated values obtained by analytically using the drag coeffieients mentioned above. When the distribution of forces acting on ground rope uder towing condition are known, the shape of it can be decided using the method proposed in this study. On the other hand the weight distribution of ground rope for making a certain ground rope shape can be decided using the method proposed in this study. (5) The author paid attention to fish reaction to the ground rope and considered a fish herding model for the ground rope. Theoretical probability of fishes entering the funnel of the bag net was calculated, and six theoretical types of ground rope: triangle, trapezoid, half ellipse, arc, parabola and catenary were compared. The fishing efficiency of trapezoid, parabola, half ellipse and catenary showed almost same values under towing condition based on the fish herding model for flat fish. The wing tips distance at maximum fishing efficiency was wider than usual towing conditions. Higher fishing efficiency would be expected under that towing condition. Fishing efficiency of two types of ground rope, middle-weighted <b>Bull</b> <b>Trawl</b> type and heavy-weighted Trawl type, were compared by towing on a sandy sea bottom using the fish herding model proposed in this study. Fishing efficiency of the former was a little higher than that of the latter. This corelates well with the results of field experiments. (6) The ratio of resistance of ground rope to the total resistance of drag net was about 30 - 35 % under towing condition. It is imposible to change a ground rope shape under towing condition by means of variation on the weight distribution of the ground rope. In the case of thinking on the ground rope shape, it is necessary to consider the hydraulic resistance of netting which were concentrated to the lacing lines and acting on the ground rope. The trapezoid shape glound rope was showed the fishing efficiency using the fish herding model proposed in this study. About 30 - 35 % of resistance of drag net should act on the points both edge of bosom of ground rope to make a trapezoid-shape ground rope. It is one method to concentrate whole drag acting on ground rope and hydraullic resistance of netting there as a results of many considerations on weight distribution of ground rope and the design of lacing lines...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} {{with the use of}} the three kinds of trawling net using of by the fishing boats, namely, trawlers, bull trawlers or Danish seiners belonging to the groups of the fishing boats of the mother ship fishery, fishing on the continental shelf of the eastern part of the Bering Sea including near the shelf, during the term from April to October for the three years of 1963, 1965 and 1967. As to the items of the fishing gears used in this research, in table 3, are shown the tonnage of the fishing boat, its number and the scale of the net used in this experiment. Namely, the number of the monther ship is 3; the number of the fishing boats belonging to those mother ships, is as in the following : ― the number of the side trawlers with tonnage of 370, is 2; that of the stern trawlers with the tonnage of 299, is 3; the total of which being 5; that of the bull trawler with the tonnage of 121 and with the tonnage of 98, is 4 and 2; the total number of with being 6; the total number of the Danish seiner is, 11; with the tonnage range from 65 to 92. In case of those trawling nets, in accordance with varieties in the sort of the net, a considerable difference is to be noted both in the weight of the ground rope and in the buoyancy of the float, but the whole lengths of the nets are almost equal. As may be seen in the introduction of this thesis, the purpose of this research is as in the following : ― through the three sorts of the fishing net used as the materials of this experimental research, namely, the trawl net, the <b>bull</b> <b>trawl</b> net, and the Danish seine, the following 3 items were aimed : (1) the attempted clarifications of the fishing efficiency of the fishing net by means of actual measurements and the model experiments; (2) the confirmation of the fundamental characteristics in the designing and making-up the respective net; (3) accompanied with the analyses of the physical and biological factors in drawing the design of the trawling net in possession of high effectivity. The experimental methods used in this research are as in the following : 1. With the use of Radar equipped on board of the mother ship lying at anchor, some tracings were made of the towing speed and the removing distance concerning the nets towed by trawlers, bull trawlers and Danish seiners and as the result of the tracings the sweeping area of the actual net towing was counted, and after combining this counted value with the value of the filtering volume, which will by mentioned in item 3, some numerical value, which is assumed to be indispensable for the determination of the fishing efficiency of the fishing net, was obtained. 2. Concerning Danish seine, in the three stages of the commencement of net to wing, its finishing and the end of net-lifting, the gradual changes in the status of boat and net happening in the lapse of time, were ascertained with the use of experimental models in 50 m. -pool, with the counting clarification of the towing speed, interval between the wing ends, and the sweeping area of the towing rope. 3. On the three sorts of trawling net (trawl net, <b>bull</b> <b>trawl</b> net, Danish seine), model experiments were carried out; and in those experiments, first the area of the net mouth under towing was counted, and {{with the use of the}} counted value, the filtering volume was fixed out, and after combining this with the sweeping area mentioned in item 1, some numerical value was fixed, and by which the fishing efficiency of the various kinds of fishing net was compared. 4. For the purpose of using as the fundamental criterion in drawing the basic designs of the respective trawling net, the following experiments were carried out : ― a) Three sorts of trawling net having the bag nets made to be equal typed, in spite of their being made of 2 sheets, 4 sheets and 6 sheets of net, each of which being typical of the trawling net, were designed, and with the use of these, some model experiments were carried out, and the respective characteristics and efficiency were brought under comparative examinations. b) Concerning the shape of the net under towing, its resistance against the flowing water and the behaviours of the fish schools entering into the net; the causes of such phenomena were put under considerate examinations, and the distribution of the current velocities in and out of the net were measured by using model nets. c) The border line of the limited possibilities of making the turning movements or the respective fish body within the bag net, in other words, the dimension of the swimming capabilities was fixed experimentally. d) The problem of what behaviour is to be taken by the fish schools against the variations of the flowing velocity within the bag net, was put under consideration to bring it to a reasonable solution, in connection with the size of the fish body and in that with the size and the scale of the fish schools, respectively; and at the same, the net formation and the net resistance at that time, were put under investigations. e) In the 50 m. -pool, using gold fish, the behaviours of the fish schools to the rope were brought under grasping, with the investigations of the driving-in effects of the net performed...|$|E
