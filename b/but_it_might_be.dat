The track was originally considered {{to be part of the}} re-release edition of Brown's second studio album, Exclusive (2007). However, after finishing the song, he took preference to another song, [...] "Forever", which later became the lead single from his re-released album, titled Exclusive: The Forever Edition (2008). He felt that [...] "Disturbia" [...] would be better suited for a female singer and instead forwarded the song to Rihanna. When writing the song, he was inspired [...] "to go totally left and kind of weird". Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings with regard to him giving the song to Rihanna: [...] "It's fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about, you can write it and give it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> an idea you have." ...|$|E
500|$|The ban expired {{the week}} ending 30 May 2008, with the {{conviction}} of Goussis {{for the murder of}} Lewis Moran, paving the way for Nine to begin screening episodes; however, Andrew Rule, who co-wrote the book on which the series is based, says Underbelly will not be seen in Victoria anytime soon, saying [...] "the problem now will be that Tony Mokbel is back in Australia and ready to stand trial on very serious charges. That will effectively prevent the series being screened in Victoria until that trial is held... That could be some time. I'm not sure about several , <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> two years." [...] However, Underbelly was legally shown in Victoria in September 2008, after a court ruled that the network could air the first five episodes. Supreme Court Justice Peter Vickery gave the network permission to air the specially edited episodes, but said screening the sixth episode could prejudice the upcoming trials of an accused criminal. The edited versions had whole scenes cut out, and Tony Mokbel's face was pixelated. Reactions from viewers were not favourable, mainly because most had already seen the entire series.|$|E

500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] is an uptempo electropop song. According to BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine, it is {{reminiscent}} of Rihanna's 2007 single [...] "Don't Stop the Music". McAlpine {{also noted that the}} song has a [...] "frosty-rave" [...] chorus accompanied with Rihanna's [...] "icy" [...] vocals. It was written by Brian Kennedy Seals, Chris Brown, Robert Allen and Andre Merritt for the re-release of Brown's second studio album, Exclusive (2007). However, after finishing the song, Brown took preference to another track, [...] "Forever", which would later be released as the first single from the re-release. He felt that [...] "Disturbia" [...] would be better suited for a female singer and gave it to Rihanna. Kennedy produced [...] "Disturbia", while Makeba Riddick produced Rihanna's vocals. The song was recorded by Andrew Vastola at Rocky Mountain Recorders in Denver, Colorado. It was mixed by Phil Tan at Soapbox Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. Additional engineering was provided by Josh Houghkirk, with assistance from Carlos Oyanedel. Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings about giving [...] "Disturbia" [...] to Rihanna: [...] "It's fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about, you can write it and give it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> an idea you have".|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} generally positive reviews from most music critics. Sam Lanksy of Idolator gave the song a favorable review, calling it [...] "an emotional ballad that shows off Mars’ sweet vocals." [...] Lansky also praised it, naming it [...] "another exceptional offering from Unorthodox Jukebox, which {{is shaping up}} {{to be one of the}} year’s best pop releases." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Pop Dust gave the song a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting that 'When I Was Your Man' is [...] "a much more satisfying, less ostentatious ballad than 'Young Girls'— though maybe the lyrics are a little too clichéd to result in a classic soul ballad the way Bruno seems to be going for." [...] However, he praised Mars, which according to him, [...] "nobody puts a song like this over quite like him, and when he hits the big high note on the song’s bridge, it’s about as striking a moment as you’re likely to hear on a pop record this year. It might be a little too perfect to be as devastating as a song like 'Someone Like You', <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a big hit just the same, and it’s guaranteed to absolutely slay in a live set." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly was positive, writing that [...] "Old-school charm still gets Mars the furthest, and the best thing here is the classic torch song 'When I Was Your Man', which finds him at the piano listing all the ways he wronged an ex. 'Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life,' he cries in his Sinatra-smooth tenor, oozing charm. Maybe he's a jerk. But he's the jerk that girl's going home with tonight." ...|$|E

2500|$|The phoneme /p/ has a {{somewhat}} marginal status as it only occurs {{as a result}} of certain morphophonological processes. The voiced plosive /b/ is mainly in contrast with /f/. Originally, [...] only occurred as an allophone of /s/ before voiced consonants; however, through the influx of loanwords from Arabic it has acquired phonemic status: àzáábí 'pain'. The glottal fricative [...] occurs as an allophone of /s, t, k, f, g/ (síddó → híddó 'where?'; tánnátóón → tánnáhóón 'of him/her'; ày fàkàbìr → ày hàkàbìr 'I will eat'; dòllàkúkkàn → dòllàhúkkàn 'he has loved'. This process is unidirectional (i.e. /h/ will never change into one of the above consonants) and it has been termed 'consonant switching' (Konsonantenwechsel) by Werner (1987:36). Only in very few words, if any, does /h/ have independent phonemical status: Werner lists híssí 'voice' and hòòngìr 'braying', <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> noted that the latter example is less convincing because of its probably onomatopoeic nature. The alveolar liquids /l/ and /r/ are in free variation as in many African languages. The approximant /w/ is a voiced labial-velar.|$|E
