40|$|Traditional and choice-based {{conjoint}} analyses (CAs) {{have used}} full or fractional factorial designs to generate concept profile descriptions. However, these designs confound two factors when costs {{are associated with}} attributes: first is {{the total cost of}} the concept profile, and second is the allocation of costs among the attributes. Both factors may influence consumers' preferences. So far, these issues have not been separated in the CA literature.

40|$|AbstractLiking {{studies are}} {{designed}} to ascertain consumers likes and dislikes {{on a variety of}} products. However, it can be undesirable to construct liking studies where each panelist evaluates every target product. In such cases, an incomplete-block design, where each panelist evaluates only a subset of the target products, can be used. These <b>incomplete</b> <b>blocks</b> are often <b>balanced,</b> so that all pairs occur the same number of times. While desirable in many situations, <b>balanced</b> <b>incomplete</b> <b>blocks</b> have the disadvantage that, by their nature, they cannot favor placing dissimilar products next to one another. A novel incomplete-block design is introduced that utilizes the target product’s sensory profile to allocate products to each panelist so that they are, in general, as dissimilar as possible while also ensuring position balance. The resulting design is called a sensory informed design (SID). Herein, details on the formulation of SIDs are given. Data arising from these SIDs are analyzed using a simultaneous clustering and imputation approach, and the results are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 44 - 46) The {{influence of}} involvement, familiarity, and product quality on consumer perceptions and attitudes was examined. Product involvement {{was measured by}} scores on the Personal Involvement Inventory (PII), (Zaichkowsky, 1985 b). Responses on a frequency of use scale represented extent of familiarity. Quality level of a snack bar product was operationalized by varying storage conditions. Subjects evaluated the experimental product at {{two of the three}} levels of quality in a <b>balanced</b> <b>incomplete</b> <b>blocks</b> design. The primary hypotheses of the author were not supported. Regression analyses revealed that PII scores and frequency of use did not significantly predict perception of differences in features.

Both convergent and discriminant validity of the PII with respect to frequency of use were demonstrated.

40|$|Consider {{the problem}} of {{estimating}} a common mean of two independent normal distributions, each with unknown variances. Note that {{the problem of}} recovery of interblock information in <b>balanced</b> <b>incomplete</b> <b>blocks</b> designs is such a problem. Suppose a random sample of size m is drawn from the first population and a random sample of size n is drawn from the second population. We first show that the sample mean of the first population can be improved on (with an unbiased estimator having smaller variance), provided m ≧ 2 and n ≧ 3. The method of proof is applicable to the recovery of information problem. For that problem, it is shown that interblock information could be used provided b ≧ 4. Furthermore for the case b = t = 3, or in the common mean problem, where n = 2, it is shown that the prescribed estimator does not offer improvement. Some of the results for the common mean problem are extended to the case of K means. Results similar to some of those obtained for point estimation, are also obtained for confidence estimation...|$|R

40|$|RAID 5 (resp. RAID 6) are two popular RAID designs, {{which can}} {{tolerate}} one (resp. two) disk failures, but the load of surviving disks doubles (resp. triples) when failures occur. Clustered RAID 5 (resp. RAID 6) disk arrays utilize a parity group size G, which {{is smaller than}} the number of disks N, so that the redundancy level is 1 /G (resp. 2 /G). This enables the array to sustain a peak throughput closer to normal mode operation; e. g. the load increase for RAID 5 in processing read requests is given by α = (G − 1) /(N − 1). Three methods to realize clustered RAID are <b>balanced</b> <b>incomplete</b> <b>blocks</b> designs and nearly random permutations, which are applicable to RAID 5 and RAID 6, and RM 2 where each data block is protected by two parity disks.

Numerical results are used to quantify the level of load increase {{in order to determine the}} value of G which maintains an acceptable level of performance in degraded mode operation. 1...|$|R

40|$|Sufu is a {{traditional}} Chinese fermented soybean curd (tofu) resembling a soft creamy cheese-type product. It is made by fungal solid-state fermentation of tofu (called pizi) followed by aging in saturated brine solution. The aims {{of this study were}} to obtain the best indigenous mold strain for sufu fermentation and produce a low salt sufu by applying Lactobacillus plantarum kik. Four indigenous mold strains were used i. e Rhizopus oligosporus, R. oryzae, Mucor hiemalis and Actinomucor elegans during pizi fermentation. The salt concentrations used in brine fermentation varied in the range of 6 % - 12 %. The results showed that the fermentation time of pizi depended on the mold species. Based on the density of the mycelium and the spores colour, pizi fermented by R. oligosporus and R. oryzae were produced after 24 hours of fermentation, while those with M. hiemalis and A. elegans were formed after 36 hours at room temperature and 55 - 68 % relative humidity (RH). Sensory evaluation of the pizi flavor indicated that the pizi fermented by A. elegans and R. oligosporus were ranked as first and second, respectively.
