5|$|By 1873, {{the college}} {{students}} playing football had made significant efforts to standardize their fledgling game. Teams had been scaled down from 25 players to 20. The {{only way to}} score was still to bat or kick the ball through the opposing team's goal, and the game was played in two 45 minute halves on fields 140 yards long and 70 yards wide. On October 20, 1873, representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City to codify {{the first set of}} intercollegiate football rules. Before this meeting, each school had its own set of rules and games were usually played using the home team's own particular code. At this meeting, a list of rules, <b>based</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> the Football Association's rules than the rules of the recently founded Rugby Football Union, was drawn up for intercollegiate football games.|$|E

It also hosts the headquarters of the Asian Development Bank. The Philippines is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country, which has an economy transitioning from being one based on agriculture to one <b>based</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> services and manufacturing. It is one of the only two predominantly Christian nations in Southeast Asia, the other being East Timor.|$|E
5|$|Reviewing {{the book}}, Charles E. Osgood {{classified}} {{the book as}} a graduate-level text <b>based</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> objective facts than on theoretical constructs. He thought the book was verbose on some topics and too brief on others {{not directly related to}} the author's expertise area. He was also critical of Miller's use of simple, Skinnerian single-stage stimulus-response learning to explain human language acquisition and use. This approach, per Osgood, made it impossible to analyze the concept of meaning, and the idea of language consisting of representational signs. He did find the book objective in its emphasis on facts over theory, and depicting clearly application of information theory to psychology.|$|E

5|$|The {{swearing}} in of Romney as the 70th {{governor of}} Massachusetts {{took place on}} January 2, 2003. He faced a Massachusetts state legislature with large Democratic majorities in both houses, and had picked his cabinet and advisors <b>based</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> managerial abilities than partisan affiliation. He declined a governor's salary of $135,000 during his term. Upon entering office {{in the middle of}} a fiscal year, he faced an immediate $650million shortfall and a projected $3billion deficit for the next year. Unexpected revenue of $1.0–1.3billion from a previously enacted capital gains tax increase and $500million in new federal grants decreased the deficit to $1.2–1.5billion. Through a combination of spending cuts, increased fees, and removal of corporate tax loopholes, the state achieved surpluses of around $600–700million during Romney's last two full fiscal years in office, although it began running deficits again after that.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, {{he formed}} {{a second group}} with Siouxsie Sioux, named the Creatures. Their music was <b>based</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> drums and percussion, with marimba and vibraphone. The 1981 Wild Things EP and 1983 {{full-length}} Feast were their first releases.|$|E

25|$|Attlee's government, however, {{failed to}} {{introduce}} the comprehensive education for which many socialists had hoped (as a means of making the educational system <b>based</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> merit and less on hereditary privilege.) This reform was eventually carried out by Harold Wilson's government. During its time in office, the Attlee Government increased spending on education by over 50%, from £6.5billion to £10billion.|$|E
25|$|South of the Kingdom of Rwanda was the Kingdom of Burundi. It {{was founded}} by the Tutsi chief Ntare Rushatsi (c. 16571705). Like Rwanda, Burundi was built on cattle raised by Tutsi pastoralists, crops from Hutu farmers, conquest, and {{political}} innovations. Under Mwami Ntari Rugaamba (c. 17951852), Burundi pursued an aggressive expansionist policy, one <b>based</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> diplomacy than force.|$|E

25|$|Seward {{remained}} resolutely single {{throughout her}} life, despite many offers, and friendships, and was quite outspoken about {{the institution of}} marriage, not unlike her heroine in Louisa, a position that would later be echoed in the novels of her step-niece, Maria Edgeworth. She shunned both marriage and sexual love, as inferior to Aristotelian friendship, <b>based</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> equality and virtue. However she had friends of both genders, although only seeking romantic relationships with women. In 1985 Lillian Faderman suggested that her orientation was lesbian, although there is little known evidence of either the erotic or sexual, in her relationships, though the term relates more to twentieth rather than eighteenth century concepts of identity. However, since 1985 Seward remains within the lesbian poetic canon. However Teresa Barnard argues against this <b>based</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> examination of her correspondence than merely her poetry, while more recently Barrett has argued for it, based on other sources.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the word}} has come to {{describe}} a trend of dress and culture modeled after African-Americans, it is inherently problematic because of its origins. The soundtrack of Wild Style was marketed in Japan as a cassette with a book of photos-scenes from the film, neighborhoods, breakers, graffiti, etc. Japan's hip hop contributions have been perceived {{by many to be}} <b>based</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> appearances than anything else.|$|E
25|$|Around 93 {{percent of}} Azerbaijan's {{population}} is nominally Muslim, while about 5 {{percent of the}} population adheres to Russian Orthodox Church. Among the Muslim majority, religious observance is relatively low and Muslim identity tends to be <b>based</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> culture and ethnicity rather than religion. The Muslim population is approximately 70 percent Shi'a and 30 percent Sunni; differences traditionally have not been defined sharply.|$|E

25|$|Spectacle makers created {{improved}} {{types of}} lenses for the correction of vision <b>based</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> empirical knowledge gained from observing {{the effects of}} the lenses (probably without the knowledge of the rudimentary optical theory of the day). The practical development and experimentation with lenses led to the invention of the compound optical microscope around 1595, and the refracting telescope in 1608, both of which appeared in the spectacle-making centres in the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the Meiji Restoration (1868), the {{tradition}} of the shinobi had become a topic of popular imagination and mystery in Japan. Ninja figured prominently in legend and folklore, where they were associated with legendary abilities such as invisibility, walking on water and control over the natural elements. As a consequence, their perception in popular culture is often <b>based</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> such legend and folklore than on the historically accurate spies of the Sengoku period.|$|E
25|$|Activity {{along the}} coast stimulated European {{interest}} in the interior, especially along the two great rivers, the Senegal and the Niger. Concerted French exploration of West Africa began in the mid-19th century, but moved slowly, <b>based</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> individual initiative than on government policy. In the 1840s, the French concluded a series of treaties with local West African chiefs that enabled the French to build fortified posts along the Gulf of Guinea to serve as permanent trading centres.|$|E
