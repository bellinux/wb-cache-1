5|$|Some {{items of}} sports equipment, which rely on {{high-performance}} materials, {{have been made}} with scandium-aluminium alloys, including <b>baseball</b> <b>bats</b> and bicycle frames and components. Lacrosse sticks are also made with scandium. The American firearm manufacturing company Smith & Wesson produces semi-automatic pistols and revolvers with frames of scandium alloy and cylinders of titanium or carbon steel.|$|E
5|$|In combat, {{players can}} use {{long-range}} weapons, such as rifles, shotguns, and bows, and short-range weapons such as handguns and short-barreled shotgun. Players can scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and <b>baseball</b> <b>bats,</b> and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies. Players can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items. Equipment {{such as health}} kits and Molotov cocktails can be found or crafted using collected items. Attributes such as the health meter and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can be recharged {{through the use of}} health kits..|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to playing the game, Adams {{was involved in}} the production of early baseball equipment. He personally manufactured baseballs for a period of time, supplying many New York City-based clubs. Adams found that when the ball was more tightly stitched, it traveled further when batted or thrown. According to author Peter Morris, Adams' ball-manufacturing efforts helped to keep the Knickerbockers in operation during their first few years, as they would otherwise have had difficulty finding balls. In later years Adams gathered rubber from old galoshes for the insides of baseballs. A tanner then used horsehide to create the balls. As late as 1863, Adams was one of the three most prominent makers of baseballs in New York, continuing to produce them by hand. Adams also played a role in producing <b>baseball</b> <b>bats,</b> choosing which wood to use and overseeing the manufacturing process.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, players can use a wide variety of weapons, {{including}} plastic bags, <b>baseball</b> <b>bats,</b> crowbars and a variety of bladed items. Later in the game, firearms become available (which cannot be used for executions). Should players take damage, their health depletes; health can be restored through the use of painkillers, which are available throughout each scene. Players also have a stamina meter which depletes as they sprint, but automatically replenishes when remaining stationary. Manhunt also makes use of the PlayStation 2's optional USB Microphone and the Xbox Live microphone feature on the Xbox in their respective versions of the game. When such a device is connected, players can use the sound of their own voice to distract in-game enemies. This adds an extra element to the stealth aspect of the game, as players must refrain from making noises such as coughing as these sounds too can attract the attention of any nearby hunters.|$|E
5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like <b>baseball</b> <b>bats,</b> car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E
25|$|Composite <b>baseball</b> <b>bats,</b> {{opposed to}} {{aluminum}} or wood <b>baseball</b> <b>bats,</b> incorporate a reinforced carbon fiber polymer, or composite, into the bat's construction. This composite material {{can make up}} {{all or part of}} the bat. Bats made entirely of this polymer are referred to as composite bats. Bats which only incorporate a portion of polymer (and the rest either wood or an aluminum alloy) are referred to as composite hybrid bats. These composite material provides an advantage over aluminum alloys and wood in durability, weight distribution, improved trampoline effect, and a higher damping rate (to reduce hand sting).|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} to using composite <b>baseball</b> <b>bats.</b> As has been chronicled in slow-pitch softball recently, composite bats have outperformed standard aluminum bats. There are five main advantages for using composite bats: swing weight, trampoline effect, bending stiffness, bending vibrations, and sound.|$|E

25|$|As a result, a new standard, {{known as}} the batted-ball {{coefficient}} of restitution (BBCOR), {{was put in place}} in 2011 which required an accelerated break in period and testing to measure the trampoline effect of composite bats.

25|$|Because of the {{increased}} risk of vandalism to curbside mailboxes, numerous vandal-resistant boxes made of composite plastic or heavy-gauge steel or aluminum plate have also entered the market.

25|$|Many {{types of}} sports {{equipment}} {{are made of}} wood, or were constructed of wood in the past. For example, cricket bats are typically made of white willow. The <b>baseball</b> <b>bats</b> which are legal for use in Major League Baseball are frequently made of ash wood or hickory, {{and in recent years}} have been constructed from maple even though that wood is somewhat more fragile. NBA courts have been traditionally made out of parquetry.|$|E
25|$|Including {{the lower}} bending stiffness, {{composite}} <b>baseball</b> <b>bats</b> {{have a higher}} damping rate. The damping rate corresponds to how quickly the material lessens the vibrations it is experiencing. Russell also states that composite bats have a damping rate anywhere from 2 to 10 times more than standard aluminum bat. Many ball players therefore refer to composite bats as more forgiving because {{if they do not}} make contact with the ball on the sweet spot, they will not feel the vibrations (sting) from the missed hit.|$|E
