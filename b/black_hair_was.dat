25|$|I {{was well}} placed at table between {{one of the}} Miss McGillivray's and a singular-looking person of about fifty. He was plainly dressed, quiet, and observant. His figure was short and compact, and his <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> worn long all round, and cut square, as if by one stroke of the shears, just above the eyebrows. His {{complexion}} was of the gardener's ruddy brown, while the expression of his deeply-furrowed features was friendly and intelligent, but his cut-short nose gave him an odd look. His speech betrayed the Welshman, although he left his native hills when very young. I might have been spared this description of Mr David Thompson by saying he greatly resembled Curran the Irish Orator...|$|E
2500|$|Troughton's costume was {{the result}} from {{discussion}} between the actor himself, producer Innes Lloyd, and script-editor Gerry Davis. He wore a black frock coat, several sizes too big, over a light-coloured shirt and very baggy trousers, which, like his bow-tie, were fixed with a safety pin. [...] In his first two stories, the trousers were orange and black two-inch check. [...] He also tended to wear a stovepipe hat and pixie boots. [...] The actor denied suggestions that his distinctive mop of jet <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> a wig.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> {{the darkest}} and most common {{of all human}} hair colors globally, due to larger populations with this {{dominant}} trait. It is a dominant genetic trait, and it is found in people of all backgrounds and ethnicities. It has large amounts of eumelanin and is less dense than other hair colors. [...] Sometimes very dark brown (blackish-brown) <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> mistaken for <b>black.</b> In English, <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> sometimes described as soft-black, raven black, or jet-black. The range of skin colors associated with <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> vast, ranging from the palest of light skin tones to dark skin. Black-haired humans can have dark or light eyes.|$|R

60|$|Thirlwell {{glanced at}} the figure rudely {{outlined}} by the dirty blue blanket on the bunk. Driscoll's face was turned to the wall, but Thirlwell saw that his <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> damp.|$|E
6000|$|With {{difficulty}} {{the two men}} dragged {{themselves to}} their feet, and supporting each other, stood before her. One of them, a clever, powerful-faced man, whose <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> tinged with grey, addressing himself to Benita, gasped: ...|$|E

60|$|The {{girl with}} the wounded cheek had found comfort in Leslie. She was seated on his knee, looking at him with solemn blue eyes, her solemnity {{increased}} by the quaint round head, whose <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> cut short.|$|E
60|$|She stood still, {{to look at}} this maid. A sullen, passionate girl! Her rich <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> {{all about}} her face, her face was flushed and hot, and as she sobbed and raged, she plucked at her lips with an unsparing hand.|$|E
60|$|Shortly {{after that}} the first flurry occurred. There came {{a knock at the}} door, {{followed}} by the entrance of a stocky Irish American of about forty years of age, whose <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> plastered over his forehead. His sea-blue eyes had a stormy look.|$|E

60|$|After {{the boys}} {{had gone to bed}} he sat and talked to me. He was curiously {{attractive}} and curiously beautiful, but somehow like stone in his clear colouring and his clear-cut face. His temples, with the <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>were</b> distinct and fine as a work of art.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' he said almost gaily; 'I feel {{enormously}} better.' But Herbert's long, oval, questioning eyes {{beneath the}} sleek <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>were</b> still fixed on his face. 'I am afraid, my dear fellow,' he said, with {{something more than}} his usual curiously indifferent courtesy, 'the struggle has frightfully pulled you to pieces.' ...|$|R

60|$|Andrea de Mancini sprawled, ingloriously drunk, {{upon the}} floor. His legs were thrust under the table, {{and his head}} rested against the chair from which he had slipped; his long <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> tossed and dishevelled; his handsome, boyish face flushed and garbed in the vacant {{expression}} of idiocy.|$|E
60|$|There {{was only}} one trouble with No. 17; the temper that went with it (and which was hidden somewhere under the glossy <b>black</b> <b>hair)</b> <b>was</b> fiery, harsh and haughty in the extreme, and it often led the Princess to do {{unpleasant}} things which she regretted {{when she came to}} wear her other heads.|$|E

60|$|In a large hall the Groac'h {{was lying}} on a couch of gold. The pink and white of her face {{reminded}} you of the shells of her palace, while her long <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> intertwined with strings of coral, and her dress of green silk seemed formed out of the sea. At {{the sight of her}} Houarn stopped, dazzled by her beauty.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{the door}} burst open, and there stalked {{into the room}} a woman of eminent but most graceful stature, and of a most {{sovereign}} and voluptuous beauty. She was habited in the Venetian dress; her dark eyes glittered with fire, her cheek was inflamed with no amiable emotion, and her long <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> disordered by the violence of her gesture.|$|E
60|$|The dancer {{looked at}} his host a little curiously. He was {{slightly}} built and without an atom of colour. His <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> closely cropped, his eyes of sombre darkness, his demeanour almost sullen. At Selingman's words, however, he nodded rapidly and seated himself more firmly upon his chair. It was apparent that although his face remained expressionless, he was gratified.|$|E

60|$|Gwen and Marjory, aged {{nine and}} twelve, slept {{together}} in a small room. It was fairly light. He saw his favourite daughter lying quite uncovered, her wilful head thrown back, her mouth half open. Her <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> tossed across the pillow: {{he could see the}} action. Marjory snuggled under the sheet. He placed the teddy-bear between the two girls.|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} came on, {{with the}} lithe, light step of a practiced walker, swinging {{a stick in}} his hand and carrying a knapsack on his shoulders. A few paces nearer, and his face became visible. He was a dark man, his <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> powdered with dust, and his black eyes were looking steadfastly forward along the road before him.|$|E
60|$|The {{man in the}} bar {{took off}} his cap and his black overcoat, and threw them on the seat behind him. His <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> short and touched with grey at the temples. He wore a well-cut, well-fitting suit of dark grey, American in style, and a turn-down collar. He looked well-to-do, a fine, solid figure of a man. The rather rigid look of the {{shoulders}} came from his having had his collar-bone twice broken in the mines.|$|E
50|$|Red and Lemon colours {{are caused}} by the e allele of MC1R. The e allele is recessive, so red and lemon dogs are {{homozygous}} e/e.

No <b>black</b> <b>hairs</b> will <b>be</b> present on either Red or Lemon dogs. If there <b>are</b> any <b>black</b> <b>hairs,</b> the dog <b>is</b> officially a tricolour.|$|R

Many authors demonstrate that the welfare queen is used to control black women as a labor force as well as their reproduction. An infrapolitical reading of <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> tutorials <b>is</b> done to analyze the ways that <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> care <b>is</b> a form of political resistance. Robin Kelley 2 ̆ 7 s use of infrapolitics to understand actions taken by working class black people is used as a model...|$|R
5000|$|In Russia, {{persons of}} Caucasus or Asian descent {{and other people}} having <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>are</b> often {{referred}} to as Black (not because of skin color).
