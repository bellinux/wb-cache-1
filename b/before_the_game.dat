5|$|Before {{its main}} release, Dynasty Warriors 4 was already looking {{promising}} after GameSpot UK’s preview two months <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was released. Although still {{very similar to}} previous titles in the series, the graphics engine had been tweaked and the gameplay been expanded, featuring more characters and stages.|$|E
5|$|Comparatively, Connecticut was {{an afterthought}} {{heading into the}} game. Pre-bowl {{coverage}} of UConn focused on NCAA rushing leader Donald Brown, who was considering foregoing his senior season to enter the 2009 NFL Draft. Brown indicated <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> that {{he had decided to}} return to UConn for the 2010 season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> media {{coverage}} {{focused on the}} geographic rivalry between the two teams, the controversies surrounding Lane Kiffin, and the performances of the players on each team. Virginia Tech played in the Chick-fil-A Bowl in 2006, losing to Georgia 31-24, and the 2009 game was its fourth appearance in the game. It was Tennessee's fifth appearance in the game, and the Volunteers had most recently lost to Clemson in the 2004 contest, 27-14. Entering the Chick-fil-A Bowl, Virginia Tech was 0-2 in games held in Atlanta during 2010, it had lost four consecutive games to SEC foes, and it had never won back-to-back bowl games (Tech won the 2009 Orange Bowl). Despite those factors, Virginia Tech was an early 4.5-point favorite and was listed as a 5.5-point favorite by spread bettors on the day <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E

5|$|At the University of Texas, {{ticket sales}} {{likewise}} were rapid. On {{the first day}} of sales, Texas' ticket office received 10,500 orders. The demand was so great that some students camped overnight in front of the ticket office to ensure they would receive a ticket. Despite that initial surge in orders, as late as December 27, four days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> tickets were still readily available. In terms of chartered flights and the number of fans spending money at New Orleans businesses, Texas also trailed Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona's Luis Suárez had {{previously}} been involved in two controversies with players in the Juventus squad: in 2012, he was found guilty by an FA commission of using racially insulting language towards Patrice Evra in a game between their respective former clubs Liverpool and Manchester United, and at the 2014 FIFA World Cup he escaped punishment for biting Chiellini but was punished retrospectively. Evra stated that he would shake Suárez's hand <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> having refused to in a previous game.|$|E
