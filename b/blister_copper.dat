500|$|The {{principal}} {{source of}} tellurium is from anode sludges from the electrolytic refining of <b>blister</b> <b>copper.</b> It is {{a component of}} dusts from blast furnace refining of lead. Treatment of 1000 tons of copper ore typically yields one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of tellurium.|$|E

40|$|The {{process design}} for {{resource}} recovery is presented, {{in which a}} waste stream of used pickling acid and of composite packaging is combined. Subsequent processing of secondary raw copper as cementation product conserves resources and saves energy. Packaging for liquid food (TetraPak etc.) and for powder is often built up of composites of paper, polyethylene and aluminium. For wet chemical treatment reject material (mostly paper fibre free, rough shredded) was used, which was examined according to its shredding behaviour. Used pickling acids are known in different compositions. The optimal conditions for the process have been identified within the wet chemical experiments. It was demonstrated that the aluminium oxide layer of the reject material could be depassivated by addition of chlorides. Regarding the reductive chemical reaction of the aluminium oxide layer it could be managed {{to carry out the}} wet chemical treatment with preservation of the valuable non-ferrous metals. For the wet chemical treatment, a newly developed combined screening stirred reactor proved particularly effective. The process happens in the reactor itself so that the product of the cementation settles and passes the sieve plate. Copper has been determined in fraction between 474 and 860 g/kg in the cementation product. From other Al-containing packaging (<b>blisters</b> etc.) <b>copper</b> has been obtained success fully in the cementation product, too...|$|R
50|$|An {{octagonal}} brick smelter chimney {{was erected}} in 1907 to improve smelter ventilation and disperse the harmful fumes. Keith Maitland-Gibson, an experienced English engineer with American experience, significantly expanded the smelter in 1907 {{even though the}} income from the copper matte declined. The lead frame was completed and the winding gear and modern mine cages were installed. A six feet by three feet water jacket furnace, Bessemerising converter of four tons capacity and flue dust chamber {{were added to the}} smelter, and boiler capacity was doubled with the smelter having a 90-ton capacity. During this time, 1,424 tons of <b>blister</b> (almost pure) <b>copper</b> were produced from 16,000 tons of ore mined, and one dividend was paid of £16,872 because of the cessation of the smelter for two months due to lack of fuel.|$|R
5000|$|From its inception, {{the copper}} smelter had been {{producing}} <b>blister</b> <b>copper,</b> originally {{for sale and}} then for refining at MIM's copper refinery in Townsville. This changed in June 1979, when two 320 tonne capacity rotary [...] "anode furnaces" [...] and a Mitsui-design anode casting wheel were commissioned in the Mount Isa smelter. The move to end exporting cold <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> from the Mount Isa smelter resulted in substantial energy savings, because the anode furnaces received molten <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> from the converters, meaning that cold <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> {{did not have to}} be reheated and melted before being cast into anodes for electrolytic refining.|$|E
5000|$|MIM {{had been}} selling <b>blister</b> <b>copper,</b> but in 1960 is started {{refining}} <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> to produce copper cathode at its new electrolytic copper refinery at Stuart, near Townsville. The initial {{capacity of the}} Copper Refineries Pty Ltd ("CRL") refinery was 40,000 t/y of refined cathode, but further construction commenced in 1960 to expand this capacity to 60,000 t/y. A new smelter {{was built on the}} same site in Mount Isa and commissioned in March 1962, lifting the copper smelting capacity to 100,000 tonnes of <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> per year.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cuprous oxide}} is {{converted}} to <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> upon heating: ...|$|E
50|$|The smelter smelts {{the copper}} {{concentrate}} mixed with silica in the Isasmelt furnace. The product from the ISA furnace is matte and slag which {{goes to the}} Matte Settling Electric Furnace. Slag is tapped out and discarded. Matte is tapped out and taken to the PS converters for further processing to <b>blister</b> <b>copper.</b> The <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> is then further processed in Anode furnaces and, thereafter, the copper is cast into anodes in a twin casting wheel. The anodes are then sent to the refinery for electro-refining.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second stage}} of {{converting}} is aimed at oxidizing the copper sulfide phase (purified in the first stage), and produces <b>blister</b> <b>copper.</b> The following reaction {{takes place in the}} converter: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> is {{put into}} an anode furnace, a furnace that refines the <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> to anode-grade copper in two stages by {{removing}} {{most of the remaining}} sulfur and iron, and then removing oxygen introduced during the first stage. This second stage, often referred to as poling is done by blowing natural gas, or some other reducing agent, through the molten copper oxide. When this flame burns green, indicating the copper oxidation spectrum, the oxygen has mostly been burned off. This creates copper at about 99% pure. The anodes produced from this are fed to the electrorefinery.|$|E
5000|$|Initial copper {{production}} used two multiple-hearth roasters, a single coal-fired reverberatory furnace and two [...] {{to produce a}} design 1,500 tons of <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> per month (18,000 tons per year). The copper smelter produced 15,000 t of copper during 1953.|$|E
50|$|Scientists at the CSIRO {{conducted}} small-scale test work on copper sulfide concentrate in 1979, {{using the}} CSIRO’s 50 kg Sirosmelt test rig. These trials included producing copper matte containing 40-52% copper and, in some cases, converting the matte to produce <b>blister</b> <b>copper.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1895, {{the first}} (business) {{contract}} {{was signed by}} Phelps Dodge and Company and the Nichols Copper Company (which was renamed from G. H. Nichols and Company in 1891) to have Phelps Dodge deliver a minimum of 1,000,000 lb of <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> over three years. This economically symbiotic relationship lasted until 1922, in which Phelps Dodge provided 90% of the <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> Nichols Copper Company used to produce 100% pure copper. During the 1920s, Phelps Dodge invested $3.5 million in the Nichols Copper Company's plant modernization projects in exchange for stock in Nichols Copper Company. This dramatically increased copper production of the plant. In 1930, Dr. William Henry Nichols died; Phelps Dodge purchased the Laurel Hill plant that same year.|$|E
50|$|The {{purity of}} this product is 98%, {{it is known}} as blister because of the broken surface created by the escape of sulfur dioxide gas as <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> pigs or ingots are cooled. By-products {{generated}} in the process are sulfur dioxide and slag. The sulfur dioxide is captured for use in earlier leaching processes.|$|E
50|$|In most cases, the slag can be discarded, perhaps {{after some}} cleaning, and the matte is further treated in {{converters}} to produce <b>blister</b> <b>copper.</b> In some {{cases where the}} flash furnaces are fed with concentrate containing a sufficiently high copper content, the concentrate is converted directly to blister in a single Outokumpu furnace and further converting is unnecessary.|$|E
5000|$|The Saindak {{mine was}} {{estimated}} to have ore reserves of 412 million tonnes containing on average 0.5 gram of gold per ton and 1.5 grams of silver per ton. According to official estimates, the project {{has the capacity to}} produce 15,800 ton of <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> annually, containing 1.5 ton of gold and 2.8 ton of silver.|$|E
50|$|In an interview, Charles Walter Nichols (or C.W. Nichols) {{explained}} that the reason his father William Henry Nichols' business grew {{and became one of}} the largest and most successful in the country was because of Phelps Dodge with its huge copper volume. During the 1890s, the Nichols Copper Company (renamed from G.H. Nichols and Company in 1891) signed the first contract with Phelps Dodge, and since then around 90 percent of Laurel Hill's business came from Phelps Dodge. The contract also granted the Phelps Dodge Corporation to deliver a minimum of one million pounds of <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> for over three years. This economically symbiotic relationship lasted until 1922, when Phelps Dodge provided 90 percent of the <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> Nichols Copper Company used to produce 100 percent pure copper. During the 1920s, Phelps Dodge invested $3.5 million in the Nichols Copper Company's plant modernization projects in exchange for stock in Nichols Copper Company. The plant's production of copper dramatically increased.|$|E
50|$|Two {{developments}} in the copper sector were noteworthy. First, in the 1987-91 period, there was {{a substantial increase in}} the output of refined copper, as well as a relative decline in the production of <b>blister</b> <b>copper.</b> Second, the state-owned Copper Corporation (Corporación del Cobre—Codelco), the world's largest copper producer, still had an overwhelmingly dominant role (accounting for 60 percent of Chile's copper output in 1991).|$|E
5000|$|YCC {{described}} the modernisation project as [...] "a great success, achieving {{all that was}} expected." [...] Energy consumption per tonne of <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> produced decreased by 34% {{as a result of}} installing the ISASMELT furnace, and YCC estimated that during the first 38 months of operation, it saved approximately US$31.4 million through reduced energy costs alone, giving the modernisation a very short payback by industry standards.|$|E
50|$|Umicore’s Hoboken plant uses a {{two-step process}} in a single furnace. The first step {{involves}} the oxidation of the feed to form a copper matte and a lead-rich slag. The slag is then tapped and the remaining copper matte is then converted to <b>blister</b> <b>copper.</b> The lead-rich slag is subsequently reduced in a blast furnace to produce lead metal, while the copper is refined and the contained precious metals recovered.|$|E
5000|$|Zhejiang Fuchunjiang Smelting Co.,Ltd. (...) {{was founded}} in 1958 and {{is located on the}} banks of the Fuchun River. The company specializes in the {{production}} and operation of copper smelting and employees more than 990 people, include engineers and technical personnel. Average annual output is 36,000 tons of <b>blister</b> <b>copper,</b> 100,000 tons of electrolytic copper, four tons of gold, 120 tons of silver, and 80,000 tons of industrial sulfuric acid.|$|E
50|$|Corbould mined with cut {{and fill}} stoping but a young Mines Inspector {{condemned}} the system, ordered it dismantled and replaced with square set timbering. In 1911, after gradual movement in stopes on the No.3 level, the smelter was closed for two months. Nevertheless, 5447 tons of <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> was produced in 1911, rising to 6690 tons in 1912 - the company's best year. Many of the surviving structures at the site were built at this time.|$|E
50|$|The Namp'o Smelting Complex is a smelter in Hadaedu-dong, Hanggu-guyŏk, Namp'o Special City, North Korea.Employing over 700 workers, it is a {{comprehensive}} nonferrous metal production facility including smelters for gold, copper and zinc, other metal rolling and alloy production, smelting by-products, and chemical fertiliser production. Annual production capacity is 15,000 tons of <b>blister</b> <b>copper,</b> 5,500 tons of refined copper, 7,000 tons of copper wire, 28,000 tons of zinc, and 5,000 tons of lime fertiliser. Concentrates and ores are received from the mines at Taedae-ri and Suan.|$|E
50|$|Copper {{concentrates}} {{produced by}} mines are sold to smelters and refiners who treat the ore and refine the copper and charge for this service via treatment charges (TCs) and refining charges (RCs). The TCs are charged in US$ per tonne of concentrate treated and RCs are charged in cents per pound treated, denominated in US dollars, with benchmark prices set annually by major Japanese smelters. The customer {{in this case}} can be a smelter, who on-sells <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> ingots to a refiner, or a smelter-refiner which is vertically integrated.|$|E
50|$|It {{was further}} {{developed}} by the Mount Cuthbert Company from about 1907. By 1912 temporary pithead gear was in place: a winch and boiler and a headframe from Charters Towers was installed the next year. By 1916 the main shaft was down 107m. Ore mined at the Kalkadoon was smelted at Mount Cuthbert from 1917 and sent to Britain as prime <b>blister</b> <b>copper.</b> It is presumed that the mine closed in 1920 when smelting ceased at Mount Cuthbert. Its manager, J. Delaney, was a well known football player in the district.|$|E
5000|$|As the ore was {{extremely}} rich, (apparently a complex mixture of oxides and sulfides {{of up to}} 15% Cu) it could be fed directly to the smelter without pre-processing other than crushing. There were 7 relatively small reverberatory furnaces in the smelter and, in the 1930s, a pair of [...] were added to produce <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> (98% copper). Due to the complex metallurgy, no {{attempt was made to}} extract the cobalt, zinc, and manganese. The company created an artificial harbour from the slag of the smelter, which still endures almost unchanged to the present day.|$|E
5000|$|In 1957, a third roaster {{was added}} in the copper smelter and {{the width of the}} reverberatory furnace was expanded. In 1960, two large roasters and a second, larger, reverberatory furnace were {{constructed}} to expand the copper smelter capacity to 70,000 t of <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> per year. The original reverberatory furnace was retained as a spare to be used in case of major maintenance of the new furnace. The new furnace was referred to as the [...] "No 1 furnace" [...] and the older, spare, furnace was named the [...] "No. 2 furnace".|$|E
5000|$|The process {{used at the}} Lünen smelter {{involves}} {{charging the}} furnace with copper residues and scrap containing between 1 and 80% copper and then melting it in a reducing environment. This produces a [...] "black copper phase" [...] and a low-copper silica slag. Initially the black copper was converted to <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> in the ISASMELT furnace. However, in 2011 the smelter was expanded {{as part of the}} [...] "KRS Plus" [...] project. A top-blown rotary converter is now used to convert the black copper and the ISASMELT furnace runs continuously in smelting mode.|$|E
50|$|The new smelter {{was blown}} in September 1910, {{a month after}} the first train arrived, and it ran well, {{producing}} 2040 tons of <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> {{by the end of the}} year. The new smelting plant made it possible to cope with low-grade sulphide ores at Mount Elliott. The use of 1000 tons of low-grade sulphide ores bought from the Hampden Consols Mine in 1911 made it clear that if a supply of higher sulphur ore could be obtained and blended, performance and economy would improve. Accordingly, the company bought a number of smaller mines in the district in 1912.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{source of}} tellurium is from anode sludges from the electrolytic refining of <b>blister</b> <b>copper.</b> It is {{a component of}} dusts from blast furnace refining of lead. Treatment of 1000 tons of copper ore typically yields one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of tellurium. The anode sludges contain the selenides and tellurides of the noble metals in compounds with the formula M2Se or M2Te (M = Cu, Ag, Au). At temperatures of 500 °C the anode sludges are roasted with sodium carbonate under air. The metal ions are reduced to the metals, while the telluride is converted to sodium tellurite.|$|E
5000|$|In 1973, a new copper concentrator, {{known as}} the [...] "No. 4 concentrator" [...] was {{commissioned}} to treat the copper ore (at a rate of six million t/y of ore containing 3% copper and 55-60% silica) and the old No. 1 concentrator was shut down, and a new fluidized-bed roaster was installed in the copper smelter to replace the multiple hearth roasters {{that had been used}} since 1953. This raised the production of <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> to 155,000 t/y. The second reverberatory furnace was brought into permanent operation to treat additional calcine produced by the new roaster.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} 1914 {{smelting}} ceased {{for more}} than a year due to shortage of ore. Although 3200 tons of <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> was produced in 1913, production fell to 1840 tons in 1914 and the workforce dwindled to only 40 men. For the second half of 1915 and early 1916 the smelter treated ore railed south from Mount Cuthbert. At the end of July 1916 the smelting plant at Selwyn was dismantled except for the flue chambers and stacks. A new furnace with a capacity of 500 tons per day was built, a large amount of second-hand equipment was obtained and the converters were increased in size.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company was}} set up by a group of Grafton businessmen, who were able to {{exercise}} local control over operations, unlike many other Australian mining ventures. <b>Blister</b> <b>copper</b> was transported to Copmanhurst wharf on the Clarence River by horse team. As timbered areas close to the mine were cut out, difficulties in transporting sufficient firewood for the smelters led to the construction of a 4-mile (6.4 kilometre) [...] gauge tramway in 1910/11. The Australian Metal Company supplied rails and rolling stock imported from Germany, including a locomotive built in Berlin by Orenstein & Koppel. Wartime difficulties led to the copper smelter ceasing production before the end of 1916, and the mine was exhausted by the end of 1917.|$|E
5000|$|The present mine is a {{conventional}} truck and shovel operation, {{with a large}} proportion of the ore crushed in-pit and transported by underground conveyors to the mill bins. The 182,000 tonnes p.a. concentrator is also conventional and is primary crushing followed by SAG mills and ball mills with cyclone classification. The flotation section produces both copper and molybdenum concentrates. [...] The 1.65 million tonnes p.a. of concentrate are smelted in one Outokumpu flash smelter and one Teniente converter with electric furnace and cylindrical slag cleaning followed by four Pierce Smith converters. The <b>blister</b> <b>copper</b> goes to six anode furnaces which feed three anode casting wheels. The anodes go on to the 855,000 tonnes p.a. electrolytic refinery.|$|E
