The <b>bast</b> <b>fibers</b> {{can be used to make}} textiles that are 100% hemp, but they are commonly blended with other organic fibers such as flax, cotton or silk, to make woven fabrics for apparel and furnishings. The inner two fibers of the plant are more woody and typically have industrial applications, such as mulch, animal bedding and litter. When oxidized (often erroneously referred to as [...] "drying"), hemp oil from the seeds becomes solid and can be used in the manufacture of oil-based paints, in creams as a moisturizing agent, for cooking, and in plastics. Hemp seeds have been used in bird feed mix as well. A survey in 2003 showed that more than 95% of hemp seed sold in the European Union was used in animal and bird feed.|$|E

50|$|The {{inner bark}} of Lagetta species—the phloem layer that carries {{nutrients}} from the leaves to the roots—consists of twenty to thirty tough, thin, dense layers of interlacing <b>bast</b> <b>fibers.</b> Whereas in most economically important fibrous plants the <b>bast</b> <b>fibers</b> are formed in straight, parallel lines, in the Lagetta species they separate and rejoin {{to form a}} fine natural net or mesh of tiny rhomboids. The lacebark tree's layers of inner bark can be carefully pulled apart to produce multiple sheets of white netting known eponymously as lacebark. Lacebark is thus unique among other tropical barkcloths in being produced without having to be beaten into shape.|$|E

30|$|The {{viscosity}} of kenaf <b>bast</b> <b>fiber</b> {{has been}} found to be highly sensitive and variable with different pulping methods; therefore, it is important to choose proper chemicals and conditions for pulping and bleaching of kenaf <b>bast</b> <b>fiber.</b> From several pulping experiments, a nonconventional pulping method with a combination of ammonium oxalate pretreatment followed by soda pulping at normal pressure and then acidic chlorite delignification was developed to obtain high-viscosity pulp (162 centipoise). The optimum level of alkali dosage of soda pulping for high-viscosity pulp was found to be 15 % (on pulp as NaOH). Pulps showed linear relations between viscosity and xylose or glucose contents, but the combination pulping method gave extremely high pulp viscosity, beyond the relations. The highest viscosity pulp from kenaf <b>bast</b> <b>fiber</b> demonstrated a tear index about twofold and a folding endurance 6.2 -fold higher than those of Manila hemp pulp with comparable tensile and burst indexes. The high-viscosity pulp could be used in the production of high-quality currency paper or longevity paper for special uses.|$|R

The stem of kenaf has two distinct parts: the bast and the core. which have markedly different chemical components and fiber morphology. In general, the length of <b>bast</b> <b>fiber</b> ranges from about 2 - 2. 5 mm, while that of the core varies from about 0. 5 - 0. 8 mm, so it is important to achieve a balance of the <b>bast</b> <b>fiber</b> and the core during pulping.

The fluffy seed hairs have been used as the traditional background for mounted butterflies and other insects. The compressed floss has a beautiful silk-like sheen. The plant has also been explored for commercial use of its <b>bast</b> (inner bark) <b>fiber</b> which is both strong and soft. U. S. Department of Agriculture studies in the 1890s and 1940s found that common milkweed has more potential for commercial processing than any other indigenous <b>bast</b> <b>fiber</b> plant, with estimated yields as high as hemp and quality as good as flax. Both the <b>bast</b> <b>fiber</b> and the floss were used historically by Native Americans for cordage and textiles.

The {{available}} retting processes are: mechanical retting (hammering), chemical retting (boiling & applying chemicals), steam/vapor/dew retting, and water or microbial retting.

40|$|<b>Bast</b> <b>fiber</b> peels of {{developing}} flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) stem contain tissue-specific soluble (1 [...] > 4) -beta-galactan. The occurrence and localization of this polymer {{have been investigated}} at various stages of <b>bast</b> <b>fiber</b> development. Tissue-specific galactan (molecular mass > 2000 kDa) emerged right below the snap point-the manually identified spot on the stem, above which the fiber cells elongate, while below no more elongation occurs, but intensive secondary cell wall thickening takes place. In the course of plant development the amount of tissue-specific galactan gradually declined and in mature plants the polymer disappeared from the fraction, being either degraded or fixed within the cell wall. The immunolocalization of (1 [...] > 4) -beta-galactans with LM 5 antibody revealed that in flax stem these polymers were present only in <b>bast</b> <b>fiber</b> cells. Two layers were well pronounced within the secondary cell wall, the density of gold particles in the inner layer was 5. 2 +/- 1. 5 times {{higher than in the}} outer layer. To distinguish soluble galactan from other (1 [...] > 4) -beta-galactans, the stem sections were treated with buffer, which elutes buffer-soluble galactan. The soluble high molecular mass (1 [...] > 4) -beta-galactan is a <b>bast</b> <b>fiber</b> cell-specific polymer, emerging at the transition from cell elongation to cell wall thickening. It is localized in the inner portion of the secondary cell wall and is modified or degraded in the course of further plant development. This polymer belongs to the rarely observed plant cell wall polysaccharides, which only occurs at one specific stage of cell development, suggesting that it could play a prominent role in cellulose deposition and secondary cell wall formation in flax fibers [...] (C) 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract. The {{wash and}} wear finish of bast fabric was {{reported}} in this paper. The influence of various factors on wash and wear finish effect was studied by method of orthogonal experimentr. The result indicated that the proper range of concentration of finish was 80 - 100 g/L with catalyst MgCl 2 of 8 % relative to dose of finishing agent at curing temperature of 160 °C for 3 mins. The wrinkle recovery angle and breaking elongation percentage could be enhanced by pretreatment with NaOH liquor of 20 - 25 g/L. The performance of the wash and wear finish could be improved by finish with amino organosilicon. In the process of low formaldehyde wash and wear finish, the concentration of finish was a key parameter, dose of catalyst MgCl 2 and curing temperature were main parameters. 1 Intorduction Though bast fabric {{is a kind of}} natural and environmentally-friendly textile fabric with fine permeability, drape and air-cooling, its development and application have been limited to dress adornment for a long time because of their defect on wash and wear performance.
