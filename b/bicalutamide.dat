25|$|<b>Bicalutamide</b> is an arylpropionamide analog, seen {{in figure}} 6. It has {{replaced}} flutamide and nilutamide as the first choice antiandrogen for prostate cancer treatment. <b>Bicalutamide</b> is not as hepatotoxic as flutamide and nilutamide and has a longer half-life, of 6 days in humans, that allows once a day administration at lower dosage. <b>Bicalutamide</b> shares the amide bond structure with flutamide. Even so, the amide bond hydrolysis was discovered in rats, not in humans, which could explain the prolonged half life of <b>bicalutamide</b> in humans.|$|E
25|$|However, hydroxyflutamide {{worked as}} an {{antagonist}} for W741 mutant ARs. This concurs with the theory that flutamide and nilutamide antagonize AR through the mechanism of “passive antagonism”, as they are of a more modest size then <b>bicalutamide.</b> These drugs may therefore be effective as a second-line therapy for refractory prostate cancer previously treated with <b>bicalutamide.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1995, <b>bicalutamide</b> was approved, and {{nilutamide}} {{followed a}} year later.|$|E
25|$|Antiandrogens are {{medications}} such as flutamide, nilutamide, <b>bicalutamide,</b> enzalutamide, and cyproterone acetate {{that directly}} block {{the actions of}} testosterone and DHT within prostate cancer cells.|$|E
25|$|NSAAs {{may be an}} {{appealing}} option for {{those who wish to}} preserve sex drive and function and/or fertility, as well as for those who desire more selective action with fewer side effects than spironolactone and cyproterone acetate (which increase the risk of depressive symptoms, among other adverse effects). <b>Bicalutamide</b> specifically may also be a safer drug than cyproterone acetate or spironolactone, as it has a much lower risk of hepatotoxicity relative to cyproterone acetate and, unlike spironolactone, has no risk of hyperkalemia or other antimineralocorticoid-associated adverse reactions. However, <b>bicalutamide</b> does have a very small risk of hepatotoxicity itself, as well as of interstitial pneumonitis.|$|E
25|$|Alderley Park {{opened in}} October 1957, and ICI Pharmaceuticals {{was formed in}} the same year. In 1962 Dora Richardson of ICI {{discovered}} tamoxifen. ICI Alderley Park later discovered Anastrozole, Fulvestrant, Goserelin and <b>Bicalutamide,</b> later made by Zeneca. Sir James Black discovered beta blockers—propranolol (Inderal) at Alderley Park in 1962. The Wellcome Foundation, a provider of much of Britain's medical research, was based from 1966-97 at Crewe Hall in Crewe Green.|$|E
25|$|Flutamide {{became the}} first NSAA to be tested clinically. Later the NSAAs <b>bicalutamide</b> and {{nilutamide}} were developed. The alleged advantages of these compounds were {{that they did not}} affect libido or potency like the other centrally acting compounds under development, luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists and cyproterone acetate. But this theory did not prove to be true. These NSAAs eventually crossed the blood–brain barrier, like cyproterone acetate, leading to a subsequent increase in serum testosterone levels.|$|E
25|$|Pure AR antagonists like {{flutamide}} and <b>bicalutamide</b> are potent progonadotropins with indirect estrogenic {{activity in}} males. This {{is because they}} block the AR in the pituitary gland and hypothalamus and thereby inhibit the negative feedback of androgens on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. This, in turn, results in increased gonadotropin secretion, activation of gonadal steroidogenesis, and an up to 2-fold increase in testosterone levels and 2.5-fold increase in estradiol levels. Conversely, AR antagonists that are also progestogens, like cyproterone acetate, are not progonadotropic, as activation of the PR is antigonadotropic, and, indeed, cyproterone acetate is potently antigonadotropic in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|Nilutamide {{has very}} low {{affinity}} for AR when tested on castrated rat prostate. Modifications such as replacing the N3 atom with oxygen has {{little effect on}} affinity of the compound for prostate AR. By replacing the oxygen atom with a sulfur atom at the C2 position of the imidazole ring and adding butylalcohol to the N3 atom, the receptor binding and biological activity of the compound increases 100 times that of NSAAs. Also the compound does not bind to other steroid receptors. If a methyl group is changed for the butylalcohol group, the compound shows 3 and 10 times more antiandrogenic activity in vivo than <b>bicalutamide</b> and nilutamide, respectively.|$|E
25|$|For <b>bicalutamide,</b> the antiandrogenic {{activities}} of sulfide and sulfone substitions of the X-linkage {{were tested in}} vitro. The sulfides showed in most cases at least 2-fold higher binding affinity than corresponding sulfones. However, this relationship was reversed when the R3 group was NHSO2CH3, where the binding affinity of sulfone was 3-fold {{higher than that of}} sulfide. These results indicate that substituents of the B-ring largely determine the effect of the X-linkage in AR binding. Researchers have proposed that the tertiary hydroxyl group is involved in direct interaction with AR because when an acetyl group is introduced to that hydroxyl moiety, the receptor binding affinity greatly decreases.|$|E
25|$|Antiandrogens, {{including}} spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide, <b>bicalutamide,</b> and finasteride, {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} or eliminate unwanted body hair, such as in the treatment of hirsutism. Although effective for reducing body hair, antiandrogens have little effect on facial hair. However, slight effectiveness may be observed, such as some reduction in density/coverage and slower growth. Antiandrogens will also prevent further development of facial hair, despite only minimally affecting that which is already there. With the exception of 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride, antiandrogens are contraindicated in men due to the risk of feminizing side effects such as gynecomastia as well as other adverse reactions (e.g., infertility), and are generally only used in women for cosmetic/hair-reduction purposes.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxyflutamide and its analogues, <b>bicalutamide</b> and nilutamide, {{share an}} anilide ring structure. The {{structures}} {{can be seen}} in figure 7, where the anilide ring is coloured red. These three compounds require an electron-deficient aromatic ring for efficient AR binding. Replacing the anilide with an alkene gives weakly active compounds, which {{can be attributed to the}} lack of intramolecular hydrogen binding or to poor hydrogen-bond donor capability. Various combinations of electron-withdrawing substitutions in the aniline ring of these drugs have not shown higher binding to the AR receptor, compared to compounds which have a chloro or trifluoromethyl group at the meta position (R1) and either a cyano or nitrogen group at the para position (R2).|$|E
25|$|Flutamide, another {{frequently}} used antiandrogen which is nonsteroidal and a pure androgen blocker, though much less potent by weight and binding affinity than either spironolactone or cyproterone acetate, {{has been found}} to be more effective than either of them as an antiandrogen when it is used at the typical treatment doses. Unfortunately, the uses of both cyproterone acetate and flutamide have been associated with hepatotoxicity, which can be severe with flutamide and has resulted in cyproterone acetate never being approved in the United States. <b>Bicalutamide</b> is a more potent, safer, and more tolerable alternative to flutamide, but is relatively little-studied in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions aside from prostate cancer, though it has been used to treat hirsutism with success. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues are another very effective option for antiandrogen therapy, but have not been widely employed for this purpose due to their high cost and limited insurance coverage despite many now being available as generics. As such, spironolactone may be the only practical, safe, available, and well-supported antiandrogen option in some cases.|$|E
2500|$|The T877A, W741L and W741C {{mutations}} [...] {{are examples}} of known AR LBD mutations. The LNCaP prostate cancer cell line expresses AR with a T877A point mutation that causes proliferation {{in the presence of}} the antiandrogens hydroxyflutamide and cyproterone acetate. This mutation has also been discovered in patients with antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome being treated with these compounds. In another study, <b>bicalutamide</b> treatment of LNCaP cells resulted in two LBD mutations, W741L and W741C, causing <b>bicalutamide</b> to acquire agonist activity to both mutant ARs. The W741L mutation generates additional space such that the sulfonyl-linked phenyl ring of <b>bicalutamide</b> is accommodated at the location of the missing indole ring of W741. In non-mutant AR, the presence of the W741 side chain probably forces <b>bicalutamide</b> to protrude out thus precluding the active position of H12 on the AR receptor.|$|E
2500|$|Nonsteroidal antiandrogens (NSAAs) used in HRT for {{transgender}} women include flutamide, nilutamide, and <b>bicalutamide,</b> {{all three}} of which are primarily used {{in the treatment of}} prostate cancer in cisgender men. Unlike steroidal antiandrogens such as spironolactone and cyproterone acetate, these drugs are pure androgen receptor antagonists. They do not lower androgen levels; rather, they act solely by preventing the binding of androgens to the androgen receptor. However, they do so very strongly, and are highly effective antiandrogens. <b>Bicalutamide</b> has improved tolerability and safety profiles relative to cyproterone acetate, as well as to flutamide and nilutamide, and has largely replaced the latter two in clinical practice for this reason. Enzalutamide is a more recently introduced NSAA with even greater potency and efficacy as an antiandrogen than <b>bicalutamide,</b> but it is still under patent protection and in relation to this is currently (and for the foreseeable future) [...] extremely expensive. Moreover, enzalutamide has been found to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the GABA receptor and has been associated with central side effects such as anxiety, insomnia, and, most notably, seizures (in ≈1% of patients), properties that it does not share with <b>bicalutamide.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bicalutamide</b> has a cyano {{group at}} the para {{position}} instead of a nitro group like flutamide and nilutamide. This change in groups avoids the nitro reduction observed in nilutamide. <b>Bicalutamide</b> has a chiral carbon in its structure (labeled with an asterisk in figure 6), which {{is connected to the}} hydroxyl and methyl groups [...] It is therefore administered as a racemate. Post-approval investigation revealed that its antiandrogenic activity resides almost entirely in the (R)-enantiomer. (R)-bicalutamide has an almost fourfold higher affinity for the prostate AR than hydroxyflutamide and has a better side-effect profile compared to other antiandrogens.|$|E
2500|$|Aromatase inhibitors {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} or prevent the estrogenic effects of {{methyltestosterone}} and 5α-reductase inhibitors {{can be used to}} prevent its potentiation in so-called [...] "androgenic" [...] tissues and thereby improve its ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity and reduce its rate of androgenic side effects. Antiandrogens like <b>bicalutamide</b> and cyproterone acetate can block both the anabolic and androgenic effects of AAS like methyltestosterone.|$|E
2500|$|Approximately 10% of {{currently}} prescribed drugs directly {{target the}} nuclear receptor class of transcription factors. Examples include tamoxifen and <b>bicalutamide</b> {{for the treatment}} of breast and prostate cancer, respectively, and various types of anti-inflammatory and anabolic steroids. In addition, transcription factors are often indirectly modulated by drugs through signaling cascades. It might be possible to directly target other less-explored transcription factors such as NF-κB with drugs. Transcription factors outside the nuclear receptor family are thought to be more difficult to target with small molecule therapeutics since {{it is not clear that}} they are [...] "drugable" [...] but progress has been made on Pax2 and the notch pathway.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bicalutamide</b> is marketed by AstraZeneca in oral tablet form {{under the}} brand names Casodex, Cosudex, Calutide, Calumid, and Kalumid in many countries. It is also marketed under the brand names Bicadex, Bical, Bicalox, Bicamide, Bicatlon, Bicusan, Binabic, Bypro, Calutol, and Ormandyl among others in various countries. The drug is sold under {{a large number}} of generic trade names such as Apo-Bicalutamide, <b>Bicalutamide</b> Accord, <b>Bicalutamide</b> Actavis, <b>Bicalutamide</b> Bluefish, <b>Bicalutamide</b> Kabi, <b>Bicalutamide</b> Sandoz, and <b>Bicalutamide</b> Teva as well. A {{combination}} formulation of <b>bicalutamide</b> and goserelin is marketed by AstraZeneca in Australia and New Zealand under the brand name ZolaCos-CP.|$|E
50|$|The {{metabolism}} of <b>bicalutamide</b> is hepatic and stereoselective. The inactive (S)-enantiomer is metabolized {{mainly by}} glucuronidation and is rapidly cleared from circulation, while the active (R)-isomer is slowly hydroxylated and then glucuronidated. In accordance, the active (R)-enantiomer has a far longer half-life than the (S)-isomer, and circulating levels of (R)-bicalutamide are 10- to 20-fold and 100-fold {{higher than those}} of (S)-bicalutamide after a single dose and at steady-state, respectively. (R)-Bicalutamide is almost exclusively metabolized via hydroxylation into (R)-hydroxybicalutamide by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. <b>Bicalutamide</b> is also glucuronidated by UGT1A9, a UDP-glucuronyltransferase, into <b>bicalutamide</b> glucuronide, and (R)-hydroxybicalutamide glucuronide is formed from the metabolism of (R)-hydroxybicalutamide by UGT1A9. Similar to the inactive (S)-enantiomer of <b>bicalutamide,</b> (R)-hydroxybicalutamide is glucuronidated and rapidly cleared from circulation. None of the metabolites of <b>bicalutamide</b> are known to be active. Following administration of <b>bicalutamide,</b> only low concentrations of the metabolites are detectable in blood plasma, while unchanged <b>bicalutamide</b> predominates. (R)-Bicalutamide has a long terminal half-life of 5.8 days with a single dose, and a terminal half-life of 7-10 days with repeated administration, which allows for convenient once-daily dosing of <b>bicalutamide.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Between January 2007 and December 2009 (a {{period of}} three years), 1,232,143 {{prescriptions}} of <b>bicalutamide</b> were dispensed in the , or about 400,000 prescriptions per year. During that time, <b>bicalutamide</b> {{accounted for about}} 87.2% of the [...] market, while flutamide accounted for 10.5% of it and nilutamide for 2.3% of it. Approximately 96% of <b>bicalutamide</b> prescriptions were written for diagnosis codes that clearly indicated neoplasm. About 1,200, or 0.1% of <b>bicalutamide</b> prescriptions were dispensed to pediatric patients (age 0-16).|$|E
50|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>bicalutamide</b> are {{unaffected by}} food, age, body weight, renal impairment, and mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. However, {{it has been}} observed that steady-state concentrations of <b>bicalutamide</b> are higher in Japanese individuals than in Caucasians, indicating that ethnicity may be associated with differences in the pharmacokinetics of <b>bicalutamide</b> in some instances.|$|E
5000|$|The tissue {{distribution}} of <b>bicalutamide</b> is not well-characterized. However, {{it has been}} reported that distribution studies with <b>bicalutamide</b> have shown that preferential (i.e., tissue-selective) accumulation in anabolic (e.g., muscle) tissues does not occur. There are no available data on hepatic <b>bicalutamide</b> concentrations in humans, but a rat study found that oral <b>bicalutamide</b> treatment resulted in 4-fold higher concentrations of the drug in the liver relative to plasma (a common finding with orally administered drugs, due to transfer through the hepatic portal system prior to reaching circulation). In men receiving 150 mg/day <b>bicalutamide,</b> concentrations of (R)-bicalutamide in semen were 4.9 μg/mL (11 μmol/L), and the amount of the drug that could potentially be delivered to a female partner during sexual intercourse is regarded as low (estimated at 0.3 μg/kg) and below the amount that is required to induce changes in the offspring of laboratory animals. <b>Bicalutamide</b> is highly protein-bound (96.1% for racemic <b>bicalutamide,</b> 99.6% for (R)-bicalutamide), mainly to albumin. It has negligible affinity for [...] and no affinity for corticosteroid-binding globulin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bicalutamide</b> {{may cause}} sexual dysfunction, {{including}} decreased sex drive and erectile dysfunction. However, {{the rates of}} these side effects with <b>bicalutamide</b> monotherapy are very low. In the [...] trial, at 7.4 years follow-up, the rates of decreased libido and impotence were only 3.6% and 9.3% in the 150 mg/day <b>bicalutamide</b> monotherapy group relative to 1.2% and 6.5% for placebo, respectively. Most men experience sexual dysfunction only moderately {{or not at all}} with <b>bicalutamide</b> monotherapy, and the same is true during monotherapy with other [...] In clinical trials, about two-thirds of men with advanced prostate cancer (and of almost invariably advanced age) treated with <b>bicalutamide</b> monotherapy maintained sexual interest, while sexual function was slightly reduced by 18%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bicalutamide</b> is an arylpropionamide analog, seen {{in figure}} 6. It has {{replaced}} flutamide and nilutamide as the first choice antiandrogen for prostate cancer treatment. <b>Bicalutamide</b> is not as hepatotoxic as flutamide and nilutamide and has a longer half-life, of 6 days in humans, that allows once a day administration at lower dosage. <b>Bicalutamide</b> shares the amide bond structure with flutamide. Even so, the amide bond hydrolysis was discovered in rats, not in humans, which could explain the prolonged half life of <b>bicalutamide</b> in humans.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bicalutamide</b> is {{pregnancy}} category X, or [...] "contraindicated in pregnancy", in the , and pregnancy category D, {{the second}} most restricted rating, in Australia. As such, it is contraindicated in women during pregnancy, {{and women who are}} sexually active and who can or may become pregnant are strongly recommended to take <b>bicalutamide</b> only in combination with adequate contraception. It is unknown whether <b>bicalutamide</b> is excreted in breast milk, but many drugs are excreted in breast milk, and for this reason, <b>bicalutamide</b> treatment is similarly not recommended while breastfeeding.|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} binding to the , the active (R)-enantiomer of <b>bicalutamide</b> has 4-fold greater {{affinity}} relative {{to that of}} hydroxyflutamide, the active metabolite of flutamide (a prodrug), and 5-fold higher affinity relative to that of nilutamide. In addition, <b>bicalutamide</b> possesses the longest half-life of the three drugs, with half-lives of 6-10 days for <b>bicalutamide,</b> 5-6 hours for flutamide and 8-9 hours for hydroxyflutamide, and 23-87 hours (mean 56 hours) for nilutamide. Due to the relatively short half-lives of flutamide and hydroxyflutamide, flutamide must be taken three times daily at 8-hour intervals, whereas <b>bicalutamide</b> and nilutamide may be taken once daily. For this reason, dosing of <b>bicalutamide</b> (and nilutamide) is more convenient than with flutamide. The greater [...] affinity and longer half-life of <b>bicalutamide</b> {{allow it to be}} used at relatively low dosages in comparison to flutamide (750-1500 mg/day) and nilutamide (150-300 mg/day) in the treatment of prostate cancer.|$|E
5000|$|Since their introduction, <b>bicalutamide</b> and {{the other}} [...] have largely {{replaced}} , an older drug and an , {{in the treatment of}} prostate cancer. <b>Bicalutamide</b> was the third [...] to be marketed, with flutamide and nilutamide preceding, and followed by enzalutamide. Relative to the earlier antiandrogens, <b>bicalutamide</b> has substantially reduced toxicity, and in contrast to them, is said to have an excellent and favorable safety profile. For these reasons, as well as superior potency, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics, <b>bicalutamide</b> is preferred and has largely replaced flutamide and nilutamide in clinical practice. In accordance, <b>bicalutamide</b> is the most widely used antiandrogen in the treatment of prostate cancer. Between January 2007 and December 2009, it accounted in the [...] for about 87.2% of [...] prescriptions. Prior to the 2012 approval of enzalutamide, a newer and improved [...] with greater potency and efficacy, <b>bicalutamide</b> was regarded as the standard-of-care antiandrogen in the treatment of the prostate cancer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bicalutamide</b> {{has been}} studied in the {{treatment}} of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in a 24-week trial of 15 patients at a dosage of 50 mg/day. Prostate volume decreased by 26% in patients taking <b>bicalutamide</b> and urinary irritative symptom scores significantly decreased. Conversely, peak urine flow rates and urine pressure flow examinations were not significantly different between <b>bicalutamide</b> and placebo. The decrease in prostate volume achieved with <b>bicalutamide</b> was comparable to that observed with the 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride, which is approved for the treatment of BPH. Breast tenderness (93%), gynecomastia (54%), and sexual dysfunction (60%) were all reported as side effects of <b>bicalutamide</b> at the dosage used in the study, although no treatment discontinuations due to adverse effects occurred and sexual functioning was maintained in 75% of patients.|$|E
5000|$|Five {{cases of}} {{hepatotoxicity}} or liver failure, {{two of which}} resulted in death, have been reported with <b>bicalutamide.</b> Symptoms that may indicate liver dysfunction include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, [...] "flu-like" [...] symptoms, dark urine, and jaundice. <b>Bicalutamide</b> has also been associated with several case reports of interstitial pneumonitis, which can potentially progress to pulmonary fibrosis. Symptoms that may indicate lung dysfunction include dyspnea (difficult breathing or shortness of breath), cough, and pharyngitis (inflammation of the pharynx, resulting in sore throat). Both hepatotoxicity and interstitial pneumonitis {{are said to be}} extremely rare events with <b>bicalutamide.</b> A few cases of photosensitivity have been reported with <b>bicalutamide.</b> Hypersensitivity reactions (drug allergy) like angioedema and hives have also uncommonly been reported in association with <b>bicalutamide.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Subsequent to its {{introduction}} {{for use in}} combination with a [...] analogue, <b>bicalutamide</b> was developed as a monotherapy at a dosage of 150 mg/day {{for the treatment of}} prostate cancer, and was approved for this indication in Europe, Canada, {{and a number of other}} countries in the early 2000s. This application of <b>bicalutamide</b> was also under review by the [...] in the [...] in 2002, but ultimately was not approved in this country. In Japan, <b>bicalutamide</b> is licensed at a dosage of 80 mg/day alone or in combination with a [...] analogue for prostate cancer. The unique 80 mg dosage of <b>bicalutamide</b> used in Japan was selected for development in this country on the basis of observed pharmacokinetic differences with <b>bicalutamide</b> in Japanese men.|$|E
5000|$|The {{incidence}} of diarrhea with <b>bicalutamide</b> monotherapy in the [...] trial was comparable to placebo (6.3% vs. 6.4%, respectively). In phase III studies of <b>bicalutamide</b> monotherapy for , {{the rates of}} diarrhea for <b>bicalutamide</b> and castration were 6.4% and 12.5%, respectively, the rates of constipation were 13.7% and 14.4%, respectively, and the rates of abdominal pain were 10.5% and 5.6%, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|The {{core side}} effects of [...] such as gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction, and hot flashes occur at similar rates with the {{different}} drugs. Conversely, <b>bicalutamide</b> {{is associated with a}} significantly lower rate of diarrhea compared to flutamide. In fact, the incidence of diarrhea did not differ between the <b>bicalutamide</b> and placebo groups (6.3% vs. 6.4%, respectively) in the [...] trial, whereas diarrhea occurs in up to 20% of patients treated with flutamide. The rate of nausea and vomiting appears to be lower with <b>bicalutamide</b> and flutamide than with nilutamide (approximately 30% incidence of nausea with nilutamide, usually rated as mild-to-moderate). In addition, <b>bicalutamide</b> (and flutamide) is not associated with alcohol intolerance, visual disturbances, or a high rate of interstitial pneumonitis. In terms of toxicity and rare reactions, as described above, <b>bicalutamide</b> appears to have the lowest relative risks of hepatotoxicity and interstitial pneumonitis, with respective incidences far below those of flutamide and nilutamide. In contrast to flutamide and nilutamide, no specific complications have been linked to <b>bicalutamide.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the [...] {{group of}} the [...] study, {{although}} 150 mg/day <b>bicalutamide</b> monotherapy had reduced mortality due to prostate cancer relative to placebo, there was a trend toward significantly increased overall mortality for <b>bicalutamide</b> relative to placebo at 5.4-year follow-up (25.2% vs. 20.5%). This was because more <b>bicalutamide</b> than placebo recipients had died due to causes unrelated to prostate cancer in this group (16.8% vs. 9.5% at 5.4-year follow-up; 10.2% vs. 9.2% at 7.4-year follow-up). At 7.4-year follow-up, there were numerically more deaths from heart failure (1.2% vs. 0.6%; 49 vs. 25 patients) and gastrointestinal cancer (1.3% vs. 0.9%) in the <b>bicalutamide</b> group relative to placebo recipients, although cardiovascular morbidity was similar {{between the two groups}} and there was no consistent pattern suggestive of drug-related toxicity for <b>bicalutamide.</b> In any case, although the reason for the increased overall mortality with 150 mg/day <b>bicalutamide</b> monotherapy has not been fully elucidated, {{it has been said that}} the finding that heart failure was twice as frequent in the <b>bicalutamide</b> group warrants further investigation. In this regard, it is notable that low testosterone levels in men have been associated in epidemiological studies with cardiovascular disease as well as with a variety of other disease states (including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and frailty).|$|E
50|$|In {{individuals}} with severe, though not mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, {{there is evidence}} that the elimination of <b>bicalutamide</b> is slowed, and hence, caution may be warranted in these patients. In severe hepatic impairment, the terminal half-life of the active (R)-enantiomer of <b>bicalutamide</b> is increased by about 1.75-fold (76% increase; half-life of 5.9 and 10.4 days for normal and impaired patients, respectively). The terminal half-life of <b>bicalutamide</b> is unchanged in renal impairment.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{case reports}} of {{interstitial}} pneumonitis (which can progress to pulmonary fibrosis) {{in association with}} <b>bicalutamide</b> treatment {{have been published in}} the medical literature. Interstitial pneumonitis with <b>bicalutamide</b> is said to be an extremely rare event, and the risk is far less relative to that seen with nilutamide (which has an incidence rate of 0.5-2% of patients). In a very large cohort of prostate cancer patients, the incidence of interstitial pneumonitis with [...] was 0.77% for nilutamide but only 0.04% for flutamide and 0.01% for <b>bicalutamide.</b> An assessment done prior to the publication of the aforementioned study estimated the rates of pulmonary toxicity with flutamide, <b>bicalutamide,</b> and nilutamide as 1 case, 5 cases, and 303 cases per million, respectively. In addition to interstitial pneumonitis, a single case report of eosinophilic lung disease in association with six months of 200 mg/day <b>bicalutamide</b> treatment exists. Side effects associated with the rare potential pulmonary adverse reactions of <b>bicalutamide</b> may include dyspnea (difficult breathing or shortness of breath), cough, and pharyngitis (inflammation of the pharynx, resulting in sore throat).|$|E
