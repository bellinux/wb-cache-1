500|$|Just a {{day after}} {{returning}} for pre-season training with Leeds, on 28 June 2013, Morison joined former club Millwall, also of the Championship, on a season-long loan deal. On rejoining Millwall, Morison stated – [...] "I'm pleased to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>here.</b> If anybody has any doubts about me all I'd say is that I aim to score plenty of goals for Millwall and help this club to greater success". Morison finished the season with eight goals in 41 appearances, helping the London club stave off relegation from the Championship with a 19th-place finish.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} Democratic primary debate, the presidential {{candidates}} were asked whether black lives matter or all lives matter. In reply, Bernie Sanders stated, [...] "Black lives matter." [...] Martin O'Malley said, [...] "Black lives matter," [...] and that the [...] "movement is making is a very, very legitimate and serious point, {{and that is that}} as a nation we have undervalued the lives of black lives, people of color." [...] In response, Hillary Clinton pushed for criminal justice reform, and said, [...] "We need a new New Deal for communities of color." [...] Jim Webb, on the other hand, replied: [...] "As the president of the United States, every life in this country matters." [...] Hillary Clinton was not directly asked the same question, but was instead asked: [...] "What would you do for African Americans in this country that President Obama couldn't?" [...] Clinton had already met with Black Lives Matter representatives, and emphasized what she described as a more pragmatic approach to enacting change, stating [...] "Look, I don't believe you change hearts. I believe you change laws". Without policy change, she felt [...] "we'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> in 10 years having the same conversation." [...] In June 2015, Clinton used the phrase [...] "all lives matter" [...] in a speech about the opportunities of young people of color, prompting backlash that she may misunderstand the message of [...] "Black Lives Matter" ...|$|E
2500|$|....the {{current system}} {{to secure the}} return of these {{abducted}} American children does not work and will not work unless it is changed profoundly. [...] I don't doubt the sincerity or {{the dedication of the}} professionals in the State Department who have lead responsibility for this problem, but {{they do not have the}} tools and powers to do their job effectively. [...] And unless Congress gives them the power and the tools we will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> in five years or 10 years with another set of hearings, another group of parents with broken hearts and devastated dreams, and we will be making the same statements we are making today." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will have}} light enough by half-past six. Do not delay later {{in taking the}} road. And see that you <b>are</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> by nightfall; I shall be anxious till you are returned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God," [...] Reuben {{muttered to}} himself, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> at last. There is no {{occasion}} for further hurry;" [...] {{and the horses}} were allowed to go at an easy walk.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you, sir, now that I <b>am</b> <b>back</b> <b>here.</b> I shall {{tomorrow}} reassume my uniform, {{and there is}} no danger of my being recognized, or of trouble arising from what I have done." ...|$|R
2500|$|Allenby {{reported}} to the War Office by telegram on 1 October, [...] "Last night the Australian Mounted Division entered the outskirts of Damascus from the N.W. The Desert Mounted Corps and the Arab Army occupied the town at 06:00 to–day. Over 7,000 prisoners have already been counted. The civil administration remains {{in the hands of}} the existing authorities, and all troops, with the exception of a few guards, have been withdrawn from the town." [...] Then he outlined his planned his trip to Damascus to his wife: [...] "I shall probably start, myself, for Damascus tomorrow; staying tomorrow night at Tiberias, and reaching Damascus on the 3rd. I do not propose to remain there; and shall probably <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> on the 4th." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} Johnny Oates {{going out in}} his Bleriot," [...] some one remarked. [...] "He'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> before long with a report." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{shall be}} hurried; I {{have promised to}} go to Clady again, and I must <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> early, and must get another horse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just done it?" [...] shouted Putney. [...] "Why, {{confound}} you!" [...] He suddenly {{brought his}} voice down. [...] "Do {{you mean to}} tell me the fellow's <b>been</b> <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> and you didn't let me know?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, perhaps, when I {{think of}} it, {{it was not}} so very bad after all," [...] Captain Dave admitted. [...] "At any rate, I am heartily glad I <b>am</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> again. We will open the shop to-morrow morning, John." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{go back to}} Boston on Saturday to read {{there on}} Monday and Tuesday. Then I <b>am</b> <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> and keep within six or seven hours' journey of hereabouts till February. My further {{movements}} shall be duly reported as the details are arranged.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you needn't suffer any longer," [...] said Marilla sarcastically. [...] "You can go, but you're to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> in {{just ten}} minutes, {{remember}} that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are not so}} wicked as I thought," [...] he growled. [...] "Get up, then, and do my bidding. You can <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> {{two hours}} after dawn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr Clare," [...] she said, [...] "I've {{called to}} see you and Mrs Clare, and to inquire if ye be well. I thought you might <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was no need}} {{of running}} it close, my dear--she had plenty of time. Your memory is at fault about my having left you late: I left you, as it happens, unusually early. I'm sorry my stay with you seemed long; for I <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> by ten." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The office isn't changed," [...] she said; {{and when}} she went out at three for belated lunch, she added, [...] "and New York isn't, either. Oh, Lord! I really <b>am</b> <b>back</b> <b>here.</b> Same old hot streets. Don't believe there are any Berkshires; just seems now as though I hadn't been away at all." ...|$|R
50|$|As the {{ceremonial}} {{gate of the}} fort, military campaigns would set out from and <b>be</b> received <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> with appropriate religious ceremonies.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hooker hath {{orders to}} proceed to a certain farm,' I answered. 'This we could take upon our return should we still have space. We shall <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> before morning.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And we'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> {{inside of}} two weeks," [...] added Dick. [...] "That is, unless we make up our minds {{to stay at}} Mr. Denton's place for a while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{at the end}} of an hour I shall <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> again. Don't {{be longer}} than you can help, lad, for I shall be very anxious until you return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} I should prefer {{to stay here}} a little and go into one or two {{questions}} of detail. Straker <b>was</b> brought <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> I presume?" ...|$|R
60|$|TIMOTHY. Don't {{be hard on}} her, Mrs. Pindar. She {{may have}} been wild-like in Newcastle, but since she <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> {{to work for the}} doctor she's been a good girl, and that happy I wouldn't know her, and a comfort to me in me old age,--what with Bert gone, and Jamesy taken to drink! And now she's run away and left me alone entirely, with the shops closed, and no work to do.|$|R
60|$|The Wilmington {{expedition}} {{has proven}} a gross and culpable failure. Many {{of the troops}} <b>are</b> <b>back</b> <b>here.</b> Delays and free talk of {{the object of the}} expedition enabled the enemy to move troops to Wilmington to defeat it. After the expedition sailed from Fort Monroe, three days of fine weather were squandered, during which the enemy was without a force to protect himself. Who is to blame will, I hope, be known.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're wrong, Nell. I'm {{glad you}} said that. You {{give me a}} chance to prove something. I'll go this minute and tell them all. I'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> in less than--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When you see Caudy {{tell him}} to report himself to me at once. I will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> in half an hour; keep strict guard as before until then, citizen sergeant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Songbird, you've got to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> by four, or half after, at the latest," [...] said Dick {{as he and}} his {{brothers}} and Stanley got out. [...] "No spooning with Minnie till six." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Greeting, son Saduko!" [...] {{he said in}} a deep, {{rumbling}} voice. [...] "Why <b>are</b> you <b>back</b> <b>here</b> so soon, and why do {{you bring}} this flea of a white man with you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, the #3 Hokies {{came into}} Morgantown and were upset 28-7. The Hokies had beaten Syracuse 51-7 previously, while West Virginia was 2-4. The game {{featured}} a 93-yard pass by Rasheed Marshall {{to give the}} Mountaineers a 21-7 lead. Marshall also scored the last touchdown on a four-yard run. West Virginia head coach Rich Rodriguez said [...] "that {{may have been the}} most electric crowd that I’ve seen since I’ve <b>been</b> <b>back</b> <b>here.</b> My wife said everybody stood up and yelled from the start until the finish of that game." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Glad to see you, Major--thoroughly glad to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> again. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> your niece; I deliver her {{safe and}} sound into your hands." [...] And between them they helped a girl to alight from the vehicle.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a dull yarn," [...] said Jimmy, apologetically. [...] "I've been boring you. By the way, Dreever {{asked me}} to square up with you for that game, in case he shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>back.</b> <b>Here</b> you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not soon; some day, perhaps, if {{all goes}} well. But I mean to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> often before that. I mean {{to be here in}} October, just for a little visit, if mamma can spare." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, the Major has fired {{them down}} the skylight, {{so as to make}} sure of her. Do you see, miss, they are putting the guns in the boat now. They will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> in a few minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, it <b>is</b> said. Come <b>back</b> <b>here</b> {{after dinner}} with Lawrence, and I {{will give you}} {{instructions:}} you shall start to-morrow at daybreak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{was only}} waiting for Davidson. Yes, I <b>was</b> coming <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> to these ruins--to Wang, who perhaps {{did not expect}} to see me again. It's {{impossible}} to guess at the way that Chinaman draws his conclusions, and how he looks upon one." ...|$|R
6000|$|FANNY. Because I didn't know. Do you think--[she rises]--that if I had I {{would ever}} have married him--to <b>be</b> brought <b>back</b> <b>here</b> and put in this ridiculous position? Do you think that I am so fond of you all that I couldn't keep away from you, at any price? ...|$|R
