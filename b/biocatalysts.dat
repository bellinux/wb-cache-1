This work {{deals with the}} obtainment of a bienzymatic immobilized <b>biocatalyst</b> constituted by Glucose Oxidase (GOx) and Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) immobilized onto SBA- 15 mesoporous silica. The effect of co-immobilization (GOx/HRP@SBA- 15) versus the separated immobilization (GOx@SBA- 15 /HRP@SBA- 15), {{and the effect of}} covalent versus physical immobilization, on protein loading and enzymatic activity were investigated. Regardless the different immobilization strategy used, {{it was found that the}} catalytic activity could be retained only if the immobilized bienzymatic <b>biocatalyst</b> was kept wet. The obtained wet GOx/HRP@SBA- 15 <b>biocatalyst</b> could be recycled 14 times keeping a good activity. Finally, the bienzymatic <b>biocatalyst</b> was tested for the oxidation of two model phenolic (caffeic acid and ferulic acid) pollutants of agricultural wastewaters, as olive mill wastewaters (OMWs).

500|$|Ribonucleases (or RNases) are {{enzymes that}} {{catalyze}} the hydrolysis of ribonucleic acid (RNA), and collectively {{they play a}} critical role in many biological processes. A RNase from R.virescens was shown to be biochemically unique amongst seven edible mushroom species in several ways: it has a co-specificity towards cleaving RNA at poly A and poly C, compared to the monospecific RNases of the others; it can be adsorbed on chromatography columns containing DEAE–cellulose as the adsorbent; it has a pH optimum of 4.5, lower than all other species; and, it has a [...] "distinctly different" [...] N-terminal amino acid sequence. The mushroom contains a unique laccase enzyme that can break down several dyes used in the laboratory and in the textile industry, such as [...] bromothymol blue, eriochrome black T, malachite green, and reactive brilliant blue.

30|$|In {{this study}} we {{constructed}} a simple <b>biocatalyst</b> {{for the production of}} value-added chemicals by using heat-treated psychrophilic cells expressing mesophilic enzymes. The psychrophile-based simple <b>biocatalyst</b> showed that the membrane permeability of the substrate was increased by heat treatment at 45 °C and most of the recombinant enzymes remained in the cells. Together with the CTC staining, heat treatment at 45 °C for 10  min is adequate to inactivate the basic metabolism of Ac 10. Thus, a psychrophilic-based simple <b>biocatalyst</b> can be constructed by using mostly mesophilic enzymes without inactivation by heat treatment. Therefore, we concluded that mesophilic enzymes can be used for a psychrophilic-based simple <b>biocatalyst,</b> and we could apply it to 3 -HPA production from glycerol.|$|R

Here, the cDNA sequence of Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) was optimized and synthesized according to the codon bias of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and based on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface display system with α-agglutinin as an anchor, recombinant yeast displaying fully codon-optimized ROL with high activity was successfully constructed. Compared with the wild-type ROL-displaying yeast, the activity of the codon-optimized ROL yeast whole-cell <b>biocatalyst</b> (25 U/g dried cells) was 12. 8 -fold higher in a hydrolysis reaction using p-nitrophenyl palmitate (pNPP) as the substrate.

30|$|The {{bioactivity}} {{of whole}} cell <b>biocatalyst</b> {{is related to}} microbial physiology (Cornelissen et al. 2011). The microbial physiology is related to cultivation condition. There are many reports {{on the effect of}} cultivation conditions on the bioactivity of whole cell <b>biocatalyst</b> (Chen et al. 2011; Olaofe et al. 2013; Ramesh et al. 2016). On the other hand, there are few reports on the effect of mycelia culture period on bioactivity of whole cell <b>biocatalyst</b> (Mascotti et al. 2012). Whole cells utilized as <b>biocatalyst</b> are usually harvested at the late logarithm phase during growing cell submerged culture (Oremland et al. 1999). In addition, even robust <b>biocatalyst</b> may exhibit very low bioactivity under an unfavorable enzymatic kinetic condition. For example, product inhibition (Julsing et al. 2012; Kuhn et al. 2013) as well as product degradation (Winter et al. 2014) usually leads to low apparent bioactivity. Segregation of product from the whole cell <b>biocatalyst</b> is an efficient strategy for prevention of product inhibition on the <b>biocatalyst</b> or elimination of product degradation, which can be achieved by process engineering. In-situ product removal, such as addition of solid-state adsorbent (Evanst and Wang 1984), nonaqueous two-phase extraction (Wang and Dai 2010), is the most common strategy for elimination of product inhibition/degradation. Cascade conversion of instable/toxic product into stable/non-toxic compound by enzymatic reaction (Willrodt et al. 2015) or non-enzymatic reaction (Xiong et al. 2015; Domaille et al. 2016; Wallace and Balskus 2016) is also developed for bioprocess optimization.|$|R

To date there is no effective and sustainable remediation strategy available. Laccases from white rot fungi were found particularly suitable for the removal of micropollutants such as the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA), the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DF) and the steroidal hormone 17 -α-ethinylestradiol (EE 2). Laccase immobilization is a prerequisite for the enzyme’s application in continuous water treatment processes. In this study, laccase from Coriolopsis sp. was immobilized on mesoporous silica particles in a two-step adsorption-crosslinking procedure. The initial laccase activity, crosslinker (glutaraldehyde) concentration and extra-protein (albumin) concentration were varied following a central composite experimental design and optimized with respect to immobilization yield, <b>biocatalyst</b> activity and thermal stability. Immobilized <b>biocatalyst</b> particles were physically characterized by scanning electron microscopy, small angle X-ray diffraction and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis revealing modifications of the surface structure and area during immobilization.

40|$|Abstract The {{potential}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for bio-catalytic whole-cell transamination was investigated using the kinetic resolution of racemic 1 -phenylethylamine (1 -PEA) to (R) - 1 -PEA {{as a model}} reaction.

In addition, the <b>biocatalyst</b> was functional without addition of the co-factor pyridoxal- 5 ′-phosphate (PLP), which {{can be explained by}} a high inherent cellular capacity to sustain PLP-dependent reactions in living cells. In contrast, external PLP supplementation was required when cell viability was low, as it was the case when using pyruvate as a co-substrate.

30|$|The {{bioactivity}} of mycelia {{as whole}} cell <b>biocatalyst</b> was {{very sensitive to}} high concentration of intracellular Monascus pigments (Table  2). This fact should {{be attributed to the}} instability of orange Monascus pigments under the experimental condition. At the same time, the inhibitory effect of product on the bioactivity of whole cell <b>biocatalyst</b> should also not be excluded. Bioactivity is an intrinsic character of mycelia as whole cell <b>biocatalyst.</b> However, it is usually underestimated or even neglected due to the measurement under an unfavorable experimental condition (Winter et al. 2014). Traditionally, biosynthesis of Monascus pigments is regarded as cell-growth dependence and production of Monascus pigments is usually carried out by microbial fermentation with growing cells (Chen et al. 2015). Benefiting from extractive fermentation in a nonionic surfactant micelle aqueous solution, intracellular Monascus pigments are exported out of cell interior and the extracellular Monascus pigments are solubilized in the nonionic surfactant micelles (Hu et al. 2012). And then, enzymatic kinetic study could be carried out by keeping <b>biocatalyst</b> in an environment with low product concentration (Fig.  2 d; Table  2). Thus, production of orange Monascus pigments by mycelia as whole cell <b>biocatalyst</b> has also been recognized (Wang et al. 2016; Hu et al. 2016).|$|R
