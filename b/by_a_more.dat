5|$|After {{his victory}} at Hastings, William {{expected}} {{to receive the}} submission of the surviving English leaders, but instead Edgar the Ætheling was proclaimed king by the Witenagemot, {{with the support of}} Earls Edwin and Morcar, Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Ealdred, the Archbishop of York. William therefore advanced, marching around the coast of Kent to London. He defeated an English force that attacked him at Southwark, but being unable to storm London Bridge he sought to reach the capital <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> circuitous route.|$|E
5|$|As the Vanir {{are often}} {{considered}} fertility gods, the Æsir–Vanir War {{has been proposed}} {{as a reflection of}} the invasion of local fertility cults somewhere in regions inhabited by the Germanic peoples <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> aggressive, warlike cult. This has been proposed as an analogy of the invasion of the Indo-Europeans. Georges Dumézil stated that the war need not necessarily be understood in terms of historicity more than any other myth however.|$|E
5|$|Bowes Castle was {{a medieval}} castle {{in the village}} of Bowes in County Durham, England. Built within the {{perimeter}} of the former Roman fort of Lavatrae, the early timber castle on the site was replaced <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> substantial stone structure between 1170 and 1174 on the orders of Henry II. A planned village was built alongside the castle. Bowes Castle withstood Scottish attack during the Great Revolt of 1173-74 but was successfully looted by rebels in 1322. The castle went into decline and was largely dismantled after the English Civil War. The ruins are now owned by English Heritage and run as a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|Development of the fertilized eggs is direct, {{in other}} words there is no {{distinctive}} larval form. Juveniles of all groups are generally planktonic, and in most species resemble miniature adult cydippids, gradually developing their adult body forms as they grow. In the genus Beroe, however, the juveniles have large mouths and, like the adults, lack both tentacles and tentacle sheaths, and in some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents, and only attain the adult form <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> radical metamorphosis after dropping to the sea-floor.|$|E
5|$|Geometric motifs are {{carved in}} the Price Building's stone cladding, {{especially}} over the first few levels. The building is topped <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> classical, specifically Châteauesque, steepled copper roof, the final composition showing Beaux-Arts influences. The main exterior decorative themes are pilasters topped with palm motifs, pinnacles and a large vaulted arch with extrados over the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|Musashi {{was built}} with a Type 0 {{hydrophone}} system in her bow. It was only usable while stationary or at low speed. In September 1942 a Type 21 air-search radar was {{installed on the}} roof of the 15-metre rangefinder at the top of the forward superstructure. Two Type 22 surface-search radars were installed on the forward superstructure in July 1943. During repairs in April 1944, the Type 21 radar was replaced <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> modern version and a Type 13 early-warning radar was fitted.|$|E

5|$|Nike-X was an {{anti-ballistic missile}} (ABM) system {{designed}} in the 1960s by the US Army to protect major cities in the United States from attacks by the Soviet Union's intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) fleet during the Cold War. The X in the name referred to its experimental basis and {{was supposed to be}} replaced <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> appropriate name when the system was put into production. This never came to pass; the Nike-X program was canceled and replaced by a much lighter defense system known as Sentinel.|$|E
5|$|Other exotic atoms {{have been}} created by {{replacing}} one of the protons, neutrons or electrons with other particles that have the same charge. For example, an electron can be replaced <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> massive muon, forming a muonic atom. These types of atoms {{can be used to}} test the fundamental predictions of physics.|$|E
5|$|The Muisca {{period is}} {{commonly}} set commencing from 800 AD and lasting until the Spanish {{conquest of the}} Muisca in 1537, although regional variations of the start dates are noted. The Early Muisca Period, roughly defined from 800 to 1000 AD, showed an increase in long-distance trade with the Caribbean coastal indigenous populations, mummification {{and the introduction of}} goldworking. The transition between Early Muisca and Late Muisca is defined <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> complex society, interregional trade of pottery, population growth and settlements of larger sizes closer to the agricultural lands. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived on the Altiplano, they described a concentration of settlements on the flatlands of the Bogotá savanna.|$|E

5|$|The Wittelsbach class {{represented}} an incremental {{improvement over the}} preceding Kaiser Friedrich III class. They were equipped with the same armament of four 24cm guns, but were given an additional torpedo tube. They had improved defensive capabilities, as they were protected <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> extensive armored belt. They also differed from the preceding ships in their main deck, {{the entire length of}} which was flush. The Kaiser Friedrich III had a cut-down quarterdeck. The ships of the class, which included Wittelsbach, Wettin, Zähringen, Schwaben, and Mecklenburg, were the first battleships built under the first Naval Law of 1898.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{official}} {{tropical cyclone}} {{of the year}} was also previously unknown until contemporary reassessments. It exhibited some hybrid characteristics, and may have qualified for subtropical cyclone status according to the modern classification scheme. On September 15, the storm formed over the central Atlantic and initially moved westward. It gradually intensified as it turned northwestward, and on September 19 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone southeast of New England. The system was subsequently absorbed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> powerful frontal boundary approaching from the northwest.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a short}} {{diversion}} {{from the}} loch at Invermoriston, where the A82 crosses the River Moriston and the A887 provides another route back to the A87 and Skye. Telford's original stone bridge over the river, constructed in 1813, was replaced <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> modern structure {{as part of an}} overall improvement to the A82 undertaken in the 1930s. Between Invermoriston and Drumnadrochit, there is a roadside memorial to John Cobb, who was killed on the loch attempting to beat the water speed record. As the A82 approaches Drumnadrochit, it passes Urquhart Castle before turning inland, away from the loch shore, to approach the village.|$|E

5|$|A {{bank and}} ditch {{enclosure}} {{was a simple}} form of defence, and when found without an associated motte is called a ringwork; when the site was in use for a prolonged period, it was sometimes replaced <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> complex structure or enhanced {{by the addition of}} a stone curtain wall. Building the hall in stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a wooden door. This led to the elevation of windows to the first floor– to make it harder to throw objects in– and to change the entrance from ground floor to first floor. These features are seen in many surviving castle keeps, which were the more sophisticated version of halls. Castles were not just defensive sites but also enhanced a lord's control over his lands. They allowed the garrison to control the surrounding area, and formed a centre of administration, providing the lord with a place to hold court.|$|E
