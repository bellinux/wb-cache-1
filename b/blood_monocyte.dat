40|$|Monocytes as antigen-presenting cells play an {{important}} role in host defence. There are several cytokines affecting monocyte function.

40|$|Patients {{with primary}} biliary {{cirrhosis}} have a {{defect in the}} receptor mediated clearance of complement coated erythrocytes by fixed macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system. To investigate the probable mechanism of this defect peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> were isolated from nine patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and seven control subjects {{and the ability of}} these cells to form rosettes with complement coated, IgM-sensitised sheep erythrocytes was assessed. Primary biliary cirrhosis peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> formed rosettes to the same extent as control peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> (71. 0 +/- 7. 1 % [SEM] versus 73. 3 +/- 4. 3 %) suggesting normal complement receptor function of primary biliary cirrhosis peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes.</b> When primary biliary cirrhosis or control peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> were preincubated with primary biliary cirrhosis serum, however, the per cent of peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> that formed rosettes was decreased: 2. 4 +/- 0. 8 and 3. 1 +/- 1. 3 fold respectively. To study this phenomenon further, fractions containing IgG or IgM synthesised by cultures of control or primary biliary cirrhosis lymphocytes were prepared. Rosette formation was not affected by exposure to fractions containing control or primary biliary cirrhosis IgG or control IgM, but was markedly inhibited (6. 0 +/- 4. 8 fold) by exposure to fractions containing primary biliary cirrhosis IgM. Similar results were obtained when freshly isolated peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> or peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> that had been cultured for 7 - 10 days [...] that is, macrophages, were used. Assuming that one can draw inferences concerning the status of fixed macrophages from data obtained using peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes,</b> {{the results of this study}} suggest that the complement specific defect in reticuloendothelial system clearance function in primary biliary cirrhosis is not caused by abnormality in the functional status of complement receptors on fixed macrophages but rather by a factor present in the serum of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis that has the capacity to inhibit the adherence of complement coated erythrocytes to complement receptors present on the surface of fixed macrophages.

The proto-oncogene c-fms expression was demonstrable in <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> but not in blood lymphocytes. Short-term cultivated <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> exhibited an increased expression of c-fms in comparison to freshly isolated <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes,</b> possibly due to a temporary down regulation of c-fms during the separation procedure of <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes.</b> A comparably high rate of fms-RNA expression was found in most of the analyzed samples of resident peritoneal macrophages, while resi-dent alveolar macrophages showed a considerably lower level of c-fms expression. in this, alveolar macrophages resembled long-term cultivated adherent <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes,</b> which showed a down regulation of c-fms expression.

Peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> from patients with rheumatoid arthritis produced significantly greater amounts of PGE 2 than control samples when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide.

Previous studies demonstrated enhanced CCR 1 and CCR 5 expression and decreased CCR 2 expression during in vitro monocyte to macrophage differentiation. To date, no study examined the in vivo differences in chemokine receptor expression between human peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> and alveolar macrophages. Methods We examined the expression of these receptors in human peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> and alveolar macrophages using microarray analysis, reverse-transcriptase PCR, flow cytometry and migration analyses. Results In contrast to peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes,</b> alveolar macrophages did not express the CCL 2 receptor, CCR 2, and did not migrate toward CCL 2. In contrast, monocytes and freshly isolated resident alveolar macrophages both migrated towards CCL 3. However, up to 6 -fold more monocytes migrated toward equivalent concentrations of CCL 3 than did alveolar macrophages from the same donor. While peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> expressed the CCL 3 receptor, CCR 1, alveolar macrophages expressed the alternate CCL 3 receptor, CCR 5. The addition of anti-CCR 5 blocking antibodies completely abrogated CCL 3 -induced migration in alveolar macrophages, but did not affect the migration of peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes.</b> Conclusion These data support the specificity of CCL 2 to selectively drive monocyte, but not alveolar macrophage recruitment to the lung and CCR 5 as the primary macrophage receptor for CCL 3. </p...|$|R

Methods. We studied conventional markers of CV risk, intima media thickness (IMT), and <b>blood</b> <b>monocyte</b> subsets in 27 patients aged 41 ± 10 years with RA of short duration (median 12 months) and 22 healthy controls. The RA subjects were divided into low (DAS 28 : 2. 6 – 5. 1) and high (DAS 28 > 5. 1) disease activity. Results. RA patients exhibited increased levels of intermediate (CD 14 ++CD 16 +) monocytes with decreased CD 45 RA expression compared to controls, increased counts of classical (CD 14 ++CD 16 −) monocytes, and decreased percentages of nonclassical (CD 14 +CD 16 ++) monocytes. Patients with high disease activity had lower HLA DR expression on classical monocytes compared to low disease activity patients. There were no differences in monocyte subsets between subjects with DAS > 5. 1 and DAS ≤ 5. 1. There were no significant intergroup differences in IMT and the majority of classical CV risk factors.

40|$|Abstract. Interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) is a {{mediator}} released by stimulated mononuclear phagocytes that {{is thought to}} play an important role in modulating T and B lymphocyte activation as well as in contributing to the febrile response and other inflammatory processes. Circulating mononuclear phagocytes, <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes,</b> readily release IL- I when stimulated. However, the ability of lung mononuclear phagocytes, alveolar mac-rophages, to dispose of the large daily burden of inhaled antigens without stimulating an inflammatory response suggests that the release of IL-I by alveolar macrophages may differ significantly from that of <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes.</b> To evaluate this hypothesis, normal autologous alveolar macrophages, obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage, were compared with <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> for their ability to release IL-I in response to a standard stimulus, lipo-polysaccharide (LPS). Alveolar macrophages were found to be at least 1, 000 times less sensitive to LPS than <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes.</b> Furthermore, alveolar macrophages released significantly less IL- 1 than <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> (26 ± 11 vs. 128 ± 21 U / 106 cells * 24 h, respectively, after stimulation with 10,ug/ml of LPS, P < 0. 001). This difference was not due to the release of substances by macrophages, which inhibited lymphocyte proliferation in response to IL- 1, or to degradation of IL-I by macrophages. Culturing macrophages in the presence of indomethacin and dialysis of macrophage supernatants did not affect the difference, and culturing macrophages with monocytes did not decrease detectable IL- 1 activity from the monocytes.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of 6 wk oral supplementation of b-hydroxy-b-methylbutyrate (HMB) and HMB combined with creatine monohydrate (HMBCr) on indices of health in highly trained athletes. Elite, male rugby league players (n = 28) were allocated to 1 of 3 groups: a control group (n = 6), a HMB group (3 g/d; n = 11), or a HMBCr group (3 g/day HMB, 3 g/d Cr; n = 11). Testing prior to, and immediately following, supplementation included a full blood count, plasma testosterone and cortisol, blood electrolytes, lipids, urea and glucose, sperm count and motility, and assessment of psychological state. A 3 × 2 factorial ANOVA revealed no effect of HMB or HMBCr {{on any of the}} measured parameters except minor changes in blood bicarbonate and <b>blood</b> <b>monocyte</b> and lymphocyte counts. Blood bicarbonate was significantly decreased in the HMB post-supplementation sample compared to the control and HMBCr groups. <b>Blood</b> <b>monocyte</b> and lymphocyte counts showed no within-group changes for HMB or HMBCr supplementation but were significantly different from the control. However, the majority of these readings remained within normal range. HMB and HMBCr were concluded to have no adverse effects on the parameters evaluated in this study when taken orally by highly trained male athletes over a 6 -wk period. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{evaluated}} the effect of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) recombinant tat-protein on the production of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by purified peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes.</b> Whereas no effects were observed on TNF-alpha and GM-CSF production, recombinant tat-protein was able to induce the production of IL- 6 by peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> in a dose-dependent fashion for concentrations ranging from 1 ng/ml to 1 micrograms/ml. Pre-exposure of tat-protein with a polyclonal neutralizing anti-tat antibody (dilution 1 : 100) completely abrogated the tat-dependent increase in IL- 6 production. The ability of tat-protein to selectively stimulate the production of IL- 6 by peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> could help to explain the presence of elevated levels of IL- 6 in the serum of HIV- 1 seropositive individuals, especially in patients in advanced stages of the disease with an active viral replication...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} which {{support the hypothesis}} that adequate steady-state levels of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) are required to overcome the effects of high catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) expression for p 38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) - � gene expression in human alveolar macrophages stimulated with asbestos. We found significant differences in the types and amounts of reactive oxygen species generated in human <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes</b> compared with human alveolar macrophages. This difference in reactive oxygen species production is related, in part, to the differences in antioxidant enzyme expression and activity. Most importantly, catalase and GPx activities were significantly increased in alveolar macrophages compared with <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes.</b> Asbestos activated the p 38 MAP kinase and induced TNF- � gene expression only in <b>blood</b> <b>monocytes.</b> Increasing the steady-state levels of H 2 O 2 by using polyethylen...|$|R
