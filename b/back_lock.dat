50|$|The pattern {{starts with}} the leader backing DC, e.g., after {{the first part of}} the quarter turns: the <b>back</b> <b>lock</b> (SQQS) is performed, {{followed}} by the change of the direction on counts SQQ (leader's steps: left foot back (follower steps outside partner), right foot back with a quarter turn to the left, left foot forward facing DW), followed by a slow step outside partner, e.g., into the forward lock (SQQS). Essentially a <b>back</b> <b>lock</b> followed by an outside change.|$|E

5000|$|The Calais was {{extensively}} restyled for 1967. Prominent styling {{features were}} given a powerful frontal appearance with [...] "forward-leaning" [...] front end, long sculptured body lines, and redefined rear fenders that had {{more than just a}} hint of tail fins in them. The full-width forward-thrust [...] "eggcrate" [...] grille was flanked by dual stacked headlights for the third consecutive year. The squarer cornered grille insert had blades that seemed to emphasize its vertical members and it appeared both above the bumper and through a horizontal slot cut into it. Rectangular parking lamps were built into the outer edges of the grille. Rear end styling revisions were highlighted by metal divided taillamps and a painted lower bumper section. For 1967, power windows became standard on the Calais line, although power seats were still optional even in the later-year models. Coupes got a new roofline, inspired by the Florentine show car created for the 1964 New York World's Fair, that gave rear seat passengers added privacy. As on that show car, the quarter window glass retracted rearward into a sail panel. New standard Calais features included non-glare rear-view mirror, electric clock, Automatic Climate Controls, padded dashboard, Hazard Warning system, outboard seatbelt retractors and rear cigarette lighters in all styles. A slide-out fuse box and safety front seat <b>back</b> <b>lock</b> for two-door models were additional Cadillac advances for the 1967 model year. Technical improvements included a revised engine valve train, different carburetor, Mylar printed circuit instrument panel, re-tuned body mounts, and a new engine fan with clutch for quieter operation. An energy absorbing steering column became optional. 1967 was the last model year for pillared sedans.|$|E

Tiffany style chrome signature scripts were again found above the body side molding on the rear fenders.

50|$|The Steyr M {{series of}} pistols employs the {{mechanically}} locked Browning short recoil {{method of operation}} with a linkless, vertically dropping barrel. The cold-hammer-forged conventional rifled barrel is locked to the slide {{by means of a}} single rectangular lug around the barrel chamber that recesses into the ejection port in the slide. When fired, the recoil impulse from the ignited cartridge drives the barrel and slide <b>back,</b> <b>locked</b> together until the bullet leaves the barrel and pressures drop to a safe level. A locking block integrated into the frame then engages a lug {{at the base of the}} chamber and drives the barrel downward, separating it from the slide and terminating any further rearward movement while the slide continues back in a straight line.|$|R

The Nike on her outstretched right hand is winged; whether there was a support under it in Phidias' original has been much discussed; evidence in surviving versions is contradictory.

5000|$|In total, {{approximately}} 15,000 Deringer pistols were manufactured. All {{were single}} barrel pistols with <b>back</b> action percussion <b>locks,</b> typically [...]41" [...] rifled bores, and walnut stocks. Barrel length varied from 1.5" [...] to 6", and the hardware was commonly a copper-nickel alloy known as [...] "German silver". The <b>back</b> action <b>lock</b> was a later, improved design among locks, {{which had its}} spring and mechanism located behind the hammer, where it was thereby protected from dirt, fired cap residue, and gunpowder residue unlike earlier front action locks that had their springs and mechanism located directly {{in the path of}} such residue in front of the hammer, under the tube.|$|R
