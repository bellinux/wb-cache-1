Meningeal melanocytoma is a <b>benign</b> <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> that derives from the melanocytes of the leptomeninges and may occur anywhere in the cranial and spinal meninges. Electron microscopy well demonstrates melanin and melanosomes within the tumor cells. The immunohistochemical pattern of this tumor includes strong positivity for S- 100 protein, vimentin, and antimelanoma antibody and negativity for epithelial membrane antigen, neuron-specific enolase, cytokeratin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Complete surgical removal is the treatment of choice, whereas radiotherapy is usually unnecessary.

At 26 °C tu-Sz ts larvae develop <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors</b> whereas 18 °C is non-permissive for tumor formation.

This phenotypic difference at the two temperatures indicates that lamellocyte encapsulation to form <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors</b> is directed against abnormal tissue surfaces.

These patients present with {{high numbers of}} myeloid lineage cells and have numerous complications. Since current MPN therapies are not curative, {{there is a need}} to find new regulators and targets of Janus kinase/Signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling that may represent additional clinical interventions. Drosophila melanogaster offers a low complexity model to study MPNs as JAK/STAT signaling is simplified with only one JAK [Hopscotch (Hop) ] and one STAT (Stat 92 E). hopTumorous-lethal (Tum-l) is a gain-of-function mutation that causes dramatic expansion of myeloid cells, which then form lethal <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors.</b> Through an F 1 deficiency (Df) screen, we identified 11 suppressors and 35 enhancers of <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors</b> in hopTum-l animals. Dfs that uncover the Hippo (Hpo) pathway genes expanded (ex) and warts (wts) strongly enhanced the hopTum-l tumor burden, as did mutations in ex, wts, and other Hpo pathway genes. Target genes of the Hpo pathway effector Yorkie (Yki) were significantly upregulated in hopTum-l blood cells, indicating that Yki signaling was increased. Ectopic hematopoietic activation of Yki in otherwise wild-type animals increased hemocyte proliferation but did not induce <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors.</b> However, hematopoietic depletion of Yki significantly reduced the hopTum-l tumor burden, demonstrating that Yki is required for <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors</b> in this background.

To determine {{the reason for the}} difference in host response against the parasitoid eggs, lamellocytes (hemocytes that encapsulate foreign objects and form capsules around endogenous tissues in <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> mutants) were examined in host larvae parasitized by the five Leptopilina strains. Parasitization by the three L. heterotoma strains affected the morphology of host lamellocytes and suppressed endogenous melanotic capsule formation in <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> hosts. L 104 did not alter the morphology of host lamellocytes nor block <b>tumor</b> formation in <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> mutant hosts. The morphology of some lamellocytes was affected by G 317 parasitization but host lamellocytes were still capable of forming <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors</b> and encapsulating dead supernumerary parasitoid larvae. Therefore, the eggs of strains affecting lamellocyte morphology are protected from encapsulation by the host's blood cells. L. heterotoma eggs float freely in the host hemocoel but L. boulardi eggs are attached to host tissue surfaces. Lamellocytes cannot infiltrate the attachment site so the capsule around the L 104 egg remains incomplete. The wasp larva uses this gap in the capsule as an escape hatch for emergence...|$|R

These lines were classified according to the subsets of hemocytes in which lacZ was expressed, and we identified five lines that can be used as lamellocyte markers. Three lines were selected for further analysis. The first exhibited strong lacZ expression in all lamellocytes. The second expressed lacZ in plasmatocytes and lamellocytes, and exhibited a <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> phenotype in larvae homozygous for the insertion. A third line showed a striking insertion-linked phenotype of melanized lymph glands (the hematopoietic organ), which resulted in the total absence of circulating hemocytes in the mutant larvae.

For type A, tissue-specific reporter gene activity was determined. For type B, a variation of enhancer detection was devised in which β-galactosidase is assayed spectrophotometrically with and without bacterial infection. Because of immune system involvement in <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> formation, a third type was hypothesized to be found among types A and B: genes that, when mutated, have a <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> phenotype. Enhancer detector strains (2800) were screened for type A, 900 for B, and 11 retained for further analysis.

40|$|In {{addition}} to its function in embryonic development, the NF-kappa B/rel-related gene dorsal (dl) of Drosophila is expressed in larval and adult fat body where its RNA expression is enhanced upon injury. Injury also leads to a rapid nuclear translocation of dl from the cytoplasm in fat body cells. Here we present data which strongly suggest that the nuclear localization of dl during the immune response {{is controlled by the}} Toll signaling pathway, comprising gene products that participate in the intracellular part of the embryonic dorsoventral pathway. We also report that in mutants such as Toll or cactus, which exhibit <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> phenotypes, dl is constitutively nuclear. Together, these results point to a potential link between the Toll signaling pathway and <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> induction. Although dl has been shown previously to bind to kappa B-related motifs within the promoter of the antibacterial peptide coding gene diptericin, we find that injury-induced expression of diptericin can occur in the absence of dl. Furthermore, the <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> phenotype of Toll and cactus is not dl dependent. These data underline the complexity of the Drosophila immune response.

The methylome fingerprints assigned tumors to entity-specific groups.

40|$|Abstract Background In metazoans, the {{hematopoietic system}} {{plays a key}} role both in normal {{development}} and in defense of the organism. In Drosophila, the cellular immune response involves three types of blood cells: plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes. This last cell type is barely present in healthy larvae, but its production is strongly induced upon wasp parasitization or in mutant contexts affecting larval blood cell homeostasis. Notably, several zygotic mutations leading to melanotic mass (or "tumor") formation in larvae have been associated to the deregulated differentiation of lamellocytes. To gain further insights into the gene regulatory network and the mechanisms controlling larval blood cell homeostasis, we conducted a tissue-specific loss of function screen using hemocyte-specific Gal 4 drivers and UAS-dsRNA transgenic lines. Results By targeting around 10 % of the Drosophila genes, this in vivo RNA interference screen allowed us to recover 59 <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> suppressor genes. In line with previous studies, we show that <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> formation is associated with the precocious differentiation of stem-cell like blood progenitors in the larval hematopoietic organ (the lymph gland) and the spurious differentiation of lamellocytes. We also find that <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumor</b> formation can be elicited by defects either in the fat body, the embryo-derived hemocytes or the lymph gland. In addition, we provide a definitive confirmation that lymph gland is not the only source of lamellocytes as embryo-derived plasmatocytes can differentiate into lamellocytes either upon wasp infection or upon loss of function of the Friend of GATA cofactor U-shaped. Conclusions In this study, we identify 55 genes whose function had not been linked to blood cell development or function before in Drosophila. Moreover our analyses reveal an unanticipated plasticity of embryo-derived plasmatocytes, thereby shedding new light on blood cell lineage relationship, and pinpoint the Friend of GATA transcription cofactor U-shaped as a key regulator of the plasmatocyte to lamellocyte transformation. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe lesswright (lwr) gene encodes {{an enzyme}} that conjugates a small ubiquitin-related {{modifier}} (SUMO). Since the conjugation of SUMO occurs {{in many different}} proteins, a variety of cellular processes probably require lwr function. Here, we demonstrate that lwr function regulates the production of blood cells (hemocytes) in Drosophila larvae. lwr mutant larvae develop many <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors</b> in the hemolymph at the third instar stage. The formation of <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors</b> {{is due to a}} large number of circulating hemocytes, which is approximately 10 times higher than those of wild type. This overproduction of hemocytes is attributed to the loss of lwr function primarily in hemocytes and the lymph glands, a hematopoietic organ in Drosophila larvae. High incidences of Dorsal (Dl) protein in the nucleus were observed in lwr mutant hemocytes, and the dl and Dorsal-related immunity factor (Dif) mutations were found to be suppressors of the lwr mutation. Therefore, the lwr mutation leads to the activation of these Rel-related proteins, key transcription factors in hematopoiesis. We also demonstrate that dl and Dif play different roles in hematopoiesis. dl primarily stimulates plasmatocyte production, but Dif controls both plasmatocyte and lamellocyte production...|$|R
40|$|In mammals, many cytokines {{and growth}} factors stimulate {{members of the}} Janus kinase (JAK) family to transduce signals for the {{proliferation}} and differentiation of various cell types, particularly in hematopoietic lineages. Mutations in the Drosophila hopscotch (hop) gene, which encodes a JAK, also cause proliferative defects. Loss-of-function alleles result in lethality and underproliferation of diploid tissues of the larva. A dominant gain-of-function allele, Tumorous-lethal (hopTum-l), leads to formation of <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors</b> and hypertrophy of the larval lymph glands, the hematopoietic organs. We show that a single amino acid change in Hop {{is associated with the}} hopTum-l mutation. Overexpression of either wild-type hop or hopTum-l in the larval lymph glands causes <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors</b> and lymph gland hypertrophy indistinguishable from the original hopTum-l mutation. In addition, overexpression of Hop in other tissues of the larva leads to pattern defects in the adult or to lethality. Finally, overexpression of either hop or hopTum-l in Drosophila cell culture results in tyrosine phosphorylation of Hop protein. However, overexpression of hopTum-l results in greater phosphorylation than overexpression of the wild-type. We conclude that hopTum-l encodes a hyperactive Hop kinase and that overactivity of Hop in lymph glands causes malignant neoplasia of Drosophila blood cells...|$|R

To find potential partners of Gcm which trigger these other pathways, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified dpias, a gene involved in post-embryonic hematopoiesis. dpias larvae show <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors</b> due to excess of lamellocytes, a hemocyte lineage that is involved in non-self recognition.

40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the {{function}} of the developmentally regulated A-type lamins we transformed Drosophila melanogaster with a construct containing the hsp 70 promoter followed by the Drosophila lamin C (an analog of vertebrate A-type lamins) cDNA. Lamin C was expressed ectopically after heat shock of embryos and localized to the nucleus. No phenotypic change was observed after lamin C expression in embryos that normally do not contain lamin C, However, ectopic expression of lamin C during most larval (but not pupal) stages stalled growth, inhibited ecdysteroid signaling (in particular during the larval-prepupal transition), resulted in development of <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors,</b> and finally caused death. During pupation in control animals, when massive apoptosis of larval tissues takes place, lamin C is proteolyzed into a fragment with a size similar to that predicted by caspase cleavage. The ectopically expressed lamin C is identically cleaved, resulting in a large increase of the steady-state level of the lamin C fragment. A null mutation of the dcp-l gene, one of the two known Drosophila caspase genes, also results in development of <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors</b> and larval death, suggesting that the ectopically expressed lamin C inhibits apoptosis through competitive inhibition of caspase activity.

We show that dSAP 18 colocalizes with histone H 3 phosphorylation, which has been implicated in the regulation of genes in response to signaling stimuli. dsap 18 mutant larvae develop <b>melanotic</b> <b>tumors</b> after heat shock and the viability of dsap 18 mutant flies is reduced after fungal infection or in high-salt medium. Altogether, our results indicate that dSAP 18 is a key player in transcriptional responses to stress.
