40|$|The {{presence}} of Salmonella in the intestinal tract, on the chickens skin and among their feathers, may cause carcasses contamination during slaughtering and processing and possibly it is responsible by {{the introduction of}} this microorganism in the slaughterhouses. A rapid method to identify and moni-tor Salmonella and their sorovars in farm is becoming necessary. A pre-enriched multiplex polymer-ase chain reaction (m-PCR) assay employing specific primers was developed and used to detect Salmonella at the genus level and to identify the Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S.

40|$|Salmonellosis {{has been}} {{recognized}} as one of the major public-health problems in many parts of the world, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is the commonest serotype encountered in most geographical situations (1). Endemicity of Salmonella has been shown to be maintained through a cyclic order from man to the environment and vice-versa (2). Explosive outbreak due to a common-source contamination is rather a rare event, and person-to-person transmission has been believed to be operating in the spread of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (3 - 5). Symptomatic and asymptomatic persons in the community usually transmit salmonellosis. However, the exact mode of its transmission has not so far been elucidated. The present study was an attempt to determine the modes of transmission of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in the endemic community of Kolkata, West Bengal, India. The study was carried out in a peri-urban slum of Kolkata (Tiljala) during August 2002 –July 2003.

40|$|Objective: To {{highlight}} {{the presence of}} aerobic bacteria in live ticks infested sheep, in Diyala Governorate, Iraq. Methods: One hundred and thirty adult alive ticks were picked up from sheep which were reared in different farms in Diyala Governorate, Iraq, {{during the period from}} November 2012 to May 2013. Ticks were classified in the Natural History Museum in Baghdad. They were dissected aseptically for extraction of the salivary gland and mid-gut. The removed tissue from each organ was inoculated in <b>buffer</b> <b>peptone</b> <b>water</b> (1 %) and incubated for 2  h at 37  °C, to maintain weak and/or injured bacterial cells, then transmitted to nutrient broth incubated at 37  °C for 18  h. Culturing was done on three solid bacteriological media (nutrient, blood and McConkey agars), and then incubated at 37  °C for 24  h. Bacterial identification was performed by using multiple biochemical tests and API- 20 strips. Data were analyzed by using Statistical Analysis System version 9. 1, 2010. Chi-square test was used for comparison at significant level of P ≤  0. 05. Results: Two species of ticks were identified [Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus and Hyalomma turanicum]. High bacterial isolation rate was observed (483 isolates). A significant high isolation rate was recorded from Rhipicephalus annulatus (63. 14 %). Six bacterial species were identified [Escherichia coli (28. 36 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18. 01 %), Bacillus cereus (14. 69 %), Staphylococcus aureus (13. 66 %), Citrobacter freundii (13. 04 %), and Enterobacter species (12. 21 %) ]. Also the high bacterial isolation rates were recorded in the temperate months (November, March and April); these coincided with high reproductive performance of ticks. Conclusions: The high isolation rate of aerobic pathogens from ticks might reflect the active contribution of this arthropod in environmental contamination and increase the probability of transmitting bacterial pathogens to their hosts...|$|R

Moreover, using the media obtained above, the author conduted the investigation of some change in the media by the preparation procedurs and of bacterial growth in it. The following results were obtained. 1) The buffer capacities of nutrient broth and <b>peptone</b> <b>water</b> were seemed to be depended upon the over-all action of substances contained in the media. However, the buffer capacity of each media could be depicted by entirely different curve at about pH 7. 0; the curve for nutrient broth showed single peak at pH 7. 0, while that for <b>peptone</b> <b>water</b> showed at pH 7. 0 and rises either sides of this caving. 2) By the addition of phosphate <b>buffer</b> to <b>peptone</b> <b>water,</b> the peak was appeared around pH 7. 0 on the buffer capacity cuve.

O procedimento bacteriológico consistiu das etapas de pré-enriquecimento, enriquecimento em caldos seletivos, plaqueamento, testes bioquímicos presuntivos e confirmação sorológica com soros polivalentes anti antígenos somáticos e flagelares de Salmonella [...] As fezes foram experimentalmente contaminadas com 8 sorotipos de Salmonella (Agona, Anatum, Enteritidis, Havana, Infantis, Owakam, Schwazengrund e Typhimurium) e a concentração final foi aproximadamente de 1, 2 x 10 ² ufc/g. As fezes foram inoculadas nos caldos enriquecedores e a partir daí, seguiu-se o mesmo procedimento utilizado para as carcaças. Os resultados referentes às carcaças de frango não foram estatisticamente diferentes (p> 0, 01) para os caldos e as placas.

The carcasses were washed with 300 mL of <b>Buffer</b> <b>Peptone</b> <b>Water</b> 0. 1 % (BPW). The BPW solation was incubated 6 h {{at ambient temperature}} and up to 24 h/ 43 ºC. From this, 2 mL were inoculate in 20 mL of enrichment broth, incubated at 43 ºC/ 24 h. The enrichment broth was plated on the five tested selective agars, also incubated at 43 ºC/ 24 h. Up to five colonies from each plate were inoculated in TSI agar and LIA agar, incubated at 37 ºC/ 24 h. The genus of Salmonella was confirmed by slide agglutination test using poly serum anti-somatic Salmonella antigens (O) and poly serum anti-fiagellar (H) Salmonella antigens. The feces were experimentally contaminated with eight Salmonella serotypos (Agona, Anatum, Enteritidis, Havana, Intantis, Owakam, Schwazengrundand Typhimurium). Each serotype was tested five times. Salmonella serotypes were added in the sample of feces individually so that the final concentration of the bacterium was 1, 2 x iO³ ufclg. Two grams of each sample were inoculated in 20 mL of the enrichment broth. The proceduring from this point wes the same adopted to carcasses examination. To broiler carcasses there was no statistic difference (p> 0, 001) among the enrichment broth and among plating media. However the use of two enrichment broth (SCN and TN) and two agars between XLD agar, SS agar and HE agar gave the bost results.

A direct polymerase chain reaction assay performed with chicken meat spiked with Salmonella typhimurium resulted in poor sensitivity (approximately 10 (7) CFU/g of meat). The use of immunoseparation with a Salmonella serogroup B-specific monoclonal antibody improved the sensitivity, but enrichment was required for the {{detection of}} low levels of contamination. Enrichment for 6 h in either <b>buffered</b> <b>peptone</b> <b>water,</b> lactose broth containing tergitol- 7, or selenite-cystine broth resulted in the detection of an initial inoculum of 100 CFU per g of meat.

40|$|Identification of Salmonella serotypes {{is based}} on flagellar and somatic antigens. The absence of flagella may {{consequently}} affect complete identification of the serotype; here it is shown that Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium exhibits morphological differences dependent on the peptone constituents of the culture medium. Aflagellate salmonella were produced in certain media where the nutritional ingredient was casein-based peptone or gelatin-based peptone; in gelatin-based peptone, aggregates of salmonella were observed. However, in media containing soy-based peptone as the primary nutrient, salmonella displayed a normal flagellated morphology. Transfer of aflagellate salmonella from nutritionally poor media, with casein- or gelatin-based peptone, into rich nutrient broth allowed flagella synthesis, indicating that the aflagellate form is still able to produce flagella. Amino acid sequencing of the peptones producing aflagellate organisms showed a relatively low tyrosine concentration: only 0 · 03 ± 0 · 01  g l− 1 for gelatin-based <b>buffered</b> <b>peptone</b> <b>water,</b> compared to 0 · 21 ± 0 · 01 for soy-based <b>buffered</b> <b>peptone</b> <b>water.</b> Tyrosine is essential for flagellin, which is the subunit of the salmonella flagellar filament.
