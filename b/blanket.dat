5|$|In R v. Fiak (2005), the {{defendant}} used a clean <b>blanket</b> {{to block the}} toilet of the police cell he was occupying, causing the water to overflow and flood his and other cells. The defence argued that clean water had flooded on to a waterproof floor, {{and that in the}} process the <b>blanket</b> was soaked by clean water. The <b>blanket</b> would have been reusable when dry. Cleaning up a wet cell floor did not constitute damage to the cell itself. The Court of Appeal noted that this argument assumed the absence of any possible contamination or infection from the lavatory itself, and held that {{while it is true that}} the effect of the appellant's actions in relation to the <b>blanket</b> and the cell were both remediable, the simple reality was that the <b>blanket</b> could not be used as a <b>blanket</b> by any other prisoner until it had been dried out and cleaned. Further, the flooded cells remained out of action until the water had been cleared. Thus, both had sustained damage, albeit temporary.|$|E

50|$|<b>Blankets</b> {{have been}} used by militaries for many centuries. Most militaries have <b>blankets</b> as {{compulsory}} for sleeping quarters in preference to duvets. Militaries are some of the biggest single consumers of woolen <b>blankets.</b> Military <b>blankets</b> tend to be coarse grey {{with a high level of}} microns, usually over 20. Suppliers include J. E. Ashworth & Sons and Faribault Woolen Mills who made half of all <b>blankets</b> in America at one time.|$|R

5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk {{walks along}} the wooded paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He strips and sunbathes on a <b>blanket.</b> Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the <b>blanket</b> and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.|$|E

50|$|Some {{electric}} <b>blankets</b> {{work on a}} {{low voltage}} of 12 to 24 volts, including those which plug into ordinary household electrical outlets; in the US, such <b>blankets</b> are sold by Soft Heat, Serta, and Select Comfort. Such <b>blankets</b> also include 12-volt <b>blankets</b> designed for in-car use; they tend to shut off automatically every 45 minutes or so.|$|R

50|$|Blasting mats {{are often}} used in {{combination}} with blasting <b>blankets</b> as an additional layer over the mats. The <b>blankets</b> are larger than the mats designed to retain the fragments that have managed {{to pass through the}} mat. Blasting <b>blankets</b> are used for both horizontal and vertical blasting. Blasting <b>blankets</b> consist of a fine-mesh strong net or industrial felt from paper mills. Both mats and <b>blankets</b> are designed to let air and gasses from the explosion pass through the cover and retain fragments.|$|R
5|$|Halkett's first {{design was}} a {{collapsible}} and inflatable boat made of rubber-impregnated cloth. When deflated, {{the hull of}} the boat could be worn as a cloak, the oar used as a walking stick, and the sail as an umbrella. This {{was followed by a}} two-man craft that was small enough to fit into a knapsack, and when deflated served as a waterproof <b>blanket.</b>|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{the high}} level of bog being {{destroyed}} by cutting has raised environmental concerns. The problem is particularly acute for raised bogs as they yield a higher-grade fuel than <b>blanket</b> bogs. Plans are now in place in both the Republic and Northern Ireland to conserve most of the remaining raised bogs on the island.|$|E
5|$|Rock {{units are}} first emplaced either by {{deposition}} {{onto the surface}} or intrude into the overlying rock. Deposition can occur when sediments settle {{onto the surface of}} the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, <b>blanket</b> the surface. Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.|$|E
50|$|Hand-woven <b>blankets,</b> treasured {{for their}} warmth and durability, often were {{embroidered}} with colorful handspun wool yarns.

50|$|Old {{or damaged}} <b>blankets</b> concern fire safety {{officials}} internationally. The {{use of such}} <b>blankets</b> is of concern due to the combination of heat, electricity, the abundance of flammable bedding material, and a sleeping occupant.

5|$|The High Court {{held that}} the Minister's order to {{prohibit}} all publications by WTBTS was not excessive. Any order other than a total <b>blanket</b> order {{would have been impossible}} to monitor administratively. Therefore, the fact that the contents of one publication were unobjectionable did not, by itself, make the ban unreasonable.|$|E
5|$|The <b>blanket</b> ban on all WTBTS {{publications}} by Order 23 was alleged by the appellants to be unreasonable and excessive. Their counsel {{contended that}} WTBTS produced publications {{that were not}} contrary to public interest, such as the King James Bible. However, all publications by WTBTS were banned under Order 123 regardless of their content.|$|E

He was seen pulling a <b>blanket</b> over himself.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of Apollo 14 samples {{suggests}} that there are five major geologic constituents present in the immediate landing area: regolith breccias, fragmental breccias, igneous lithologies, granulitic lithologies, and impact-melt lithologies. Samples of each of these compositions were recovered in one or both of two major surface units of the Apollo 14 landing site within Fra Mauro: the immediate impact <b>blanket</b> of Cone crater, about 25 million years old, and surrounding older terrain.|$|E
5|$|As {{soldiers}} {{approached the}} sacristy, {{one of the}} young sons of defender Anthony Wolf stood to pull a <b>blanket</b> over his shoulders. In the dark, Mexican soldiers mistook him for an adult and killed him. Possibly the last Texian to die in battle was Jacob Walker, who attempted to hide behind Susannah Dickinson and was bayoneted in front of the women. Another Texian, Brigido Guerrero, also sought refuge in the sacristy. Guerrero, who had deserted from the Mexican Army in December 1835, was spared after convincing the soldiers he was a Texian prisoner.|$|E

5|$|As the Kentucky Supreme Court {{prepared}} to hear Fletcher's appeal {{on whether the}} grand jury could continue to indict people covered by his <b>blanket</b> pardon, two of the court's seven justices recused themselves from the case, citing conflicts of interest. Kentucky's constitution provides that, {{in the case of}} more than one recusal on the court, the governor is to appoint special justices to replace them. Accordingly, Fletcher named two replacements, but one of those – Circuit Judge Jeffrey Burdette – declined to serve on grounds that he had contributed to Fletcher's 2003 gubernatorial campaign. Fletcher then named another special justice to replace Burdette, consistent with a precedent set by former Democratic Governor Brereton Jones. Stumbo challenged this third appointment, claiming that Burdette's refusal to serve created only one vacancy on the court, and that the case could be tried with six justices. The Kentucky Supreme Court sustained Stumbo's complaint. In a 4–2 ruling issued May 18, 2006, the Kentucky Supreme Court barred the grand jury from issuing further indictments against individuals covered by Fletcher's <b>blanket</b> pardon, reversing the Court of Appeals. The ruling did not affect indictments for crimes allegedly committed after the pardon was issued. The Supreme Court also held that the grand jury could issue a general report of its findings at the conclusion of its investigation, but left open {{the question of whether the}} names of unindicted individuals could appear in the report. A later decision by the Court of Appeals found that unindicted individuals could not be named in the report.|$|E
