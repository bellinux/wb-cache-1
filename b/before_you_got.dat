500|$|The {{show was}} much less {{politically}} focused than it later became under Jon Stewart, having what Stephen Colbert described as a local news feel and involving more character-driven humor as opposed to news-driven humor. Winstead recalls that when the show was first launched there was constant debate regarding what the show's focus should be. While she wanted a more news-driven focus, the network was concerned that this would not appeal to viewers and pushed for [...] "a little more of a hybrid of entertainment and politics". The show was slammed by some reviewers as being too mean-spirited, particularly towards the interview subjects of field pieces; a criticism acknowledged {{by some of the}} show's cast. Describing his time as a correspondent under Kilborn, Colbert says, [...] "You wanted to take your soul off, put it on a wire hanger, and leave it in the closet <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> on the plane to do one of these pieces." [...] One reviewer from The New York Times criticized the show for being too cruel and for lacking a central editorial vision or ideology, describing it as [...] "bereft of an ideological or artistic center... precocious but empty." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{will just}} take my friends to the hotel, and shall be back from there <b>before</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> men {{to take these}} fellows away. If you {{go to one of}} those ships and borrow a bucket, empty it over each of them; you will find that will bring them to!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Damn it. George, {{you don't}} {{seem to see}} I'm serious! You're always sneering at Tono-Bungay! As though it {{was some sort of}} swindle. It was perfec'ly {{legitimate}} trade, perfec'ly legitimate. Good value and a good article.... When I come up here and tell you plans and exchange idees--you sneer at me. You do. You don't see--it's a big thing. It's a big thing. <b>You</b> <b>got</b> to get used to new circumstances. <b>You</b> <b>got</b> to face what lies <b>before</b> us. <b>You</b> <b>got</b> to drop that tone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were even}} grateful. You shook {{him by the}} hand. You left him at the hotel at Southampton only an hour <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> my telegram." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{where are}} all the others, {{and how is it}} you are here alone? Of course, you must have turned back <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to where the bush rangers were." ...|$|E
60|$|What {{he was on}} {{the look}} out for--to quote his own description--was a really first class article, not {{something}} from which the paint would come off almost <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> it home.|$|E
6000|$|... “This very case {{shows that}} it is reasonable. Here you want to plant a part <b>before</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> the ground prepared. The real reason is because you are tired of digging; not because you are really of opinion {{that that would be}} a better plan. You have not the means of judging whether it is, or is not, now, time to begin to put in seeds.” ...|$|R
60|$|You wouldn't {{believe how}} those two fellows went at it! They charged {{into the street}} with the shutters--one, two, three--had 'em up in their places--four, five, six--barred 'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight, nine--and came back <b>before</b> <b>you</b> could have <b>got</b> to twelve, panting like race-horses.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought we'd drop <b>before</b> we <b>got</b> <b>you</b> fellows up," [...] added Werner. [...] "You {{sure are}} some sleepers," [...] he grumbled, as he too sank {{down on a}} seat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{very glad}} to see you, but if I'd known who was there I'd have fixed the place up <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> in," [...] he said. [...] "Sit right down beside the stove." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{can imagine}} she seemed very {{pleasant}} to you,” the girl laughed; “and, of course, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> {{out of the}} window and {{climbed to the top of}} the house you kissed her, didn’t you?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I could shear {{your arm}} off <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> it out," [...] he said. [...] "Will you lay it down, {{and see if}} you can stop in this shanty when I tell you to get out." ...|$|E
6000|$|The little Scotchman {{shook his}} head. [...] "There {{was nothing to}} settle. It all depends {{how you look at}} it. The other way would be to say it was settled, entirely settled, mind <b>you,</b> <b>before</b> I <b>got</b> there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was, {{but that}} was twenty-four years ago and <b>before</b> <b>you</b> were born. <b>Got</b> my first lift with the ten {{thousand}} dollars I made in the next state down this coast, besides the ague and shivers that have never quite left me. However, it's pretty healthy up here, and I guess it ought to suit Jake all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so, John," [...] said Lillie, {{going on}} without noticing this interruption, [...] "I wanted just to tell <b>you,</b> <b>before</b> I <b>got</b> any weaker, that I know and feel just how patient and noble and good {{you have always}} been to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{said these}} men {{belonged to a}} Pomeranian regiment. Had they left <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> there? But I suppose not, or else {{you would not have}} been wounded. How was it that you heard of the attack?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} that that would do," [...] Harry agreed, [...] "but {{you would have to}} bolt very sharp for, if it went off <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> {{to the bottom of the}} steps, it might be very awkward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Malcolm, so sudden {{a summons}} augurs desperate duty, maybe {{a long night}} march; you would break down <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> half a mile; besides, as only the musketeers have to go, half the {{officers}} must remain here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Notwithstanding the fact," [...] Sir Edward {{reminded}} him quietly, [...] "that you were {{probably the last}} person to see Vanderpole alive? He came to the Savoy to call upon <b>you</b> <b>before</b> he <b>got</b> into the taxicab where he was murdered. That is so, isn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Captain Marchand {{held out}} his hand. [...] "Good-day to you, friend Bonnet," [...] he said. [...] "I had hoped {{that you would be}} one of the first friends I should meet when I reached port at Bridgetown, but I little thought to meet <b>you</b> <b>before</b> I <b>got</b> there." ...|$|R
60|$|About {{the only}} {{drawback}} to going barefoot was stumping your toe, {{which you were}} pretty sure {{to do when you}} first took off your shoes and <b>before</b> <b>you</b> had <b>got</b> used to your new running weight. When you struck your toe against a rock, or anything, you caught it up in your hand, and hopped about a hundred yards <b>before</b> <b>you</b> could bear to put it to the ground. Then you sat down, and held it as tight as you could, and cried over it, till the fellows helped you to the pump to wash the blood off. Then, as soon as you could, you limped home for a rag, and kept pretty quiet about it so as to get out again without letting on to your mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Clavering quietly. [...] "I'm {{afraid you}} would be frozen <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> there. The homestead-boys who chop their fuel in the bluff have, however, some kind of shelter, and I'll make you a big fire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now you {{are going}} to make it all the worse by being stupid," [...] cried the girl petulantly. [...] "Why can't you be nice, as you used to be <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> this silly notion into your head?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How be you?" [...] said Mr. Jenney; [...] "kind of {{lucky you}} {{happened}} along here, wahn't it? You'd have been soaked <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to Harris's. How be you? I ain't seen you since that highfalutin party up to Crewe's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By no means, Drummond. I {{only wish}} {{that we had}} known your {{situation}} <b>before.</b> <b>You</b> should have <b>got</b> someone to write, if you could not do it yourself. We were not surprised at your not visiting us in the winter, for with both armies on the alert we knew that, in the first place, you were busy, and probably {{not able to get}} leave of absence; and in the next place, you could hardly have got in.|$|R
5000|$|All things {{still look}} {{well for a}} {{favorable}} conclusion to the war.I {{do not expect to}} see it ended so speedily as many suppose, but patience will carry us through.

6000|$|... 'This {{is great}} news indeed, Mr Wegg. There's no denying it. But I could have wished you had told it me <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> your fright to-night, and I could have wished you had ever asked me as your partner {{what we were}} to do, before {{you thought you were}} {{dividing}} a responsibility.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can {{you help}} me? Can you help me?" [...] she gasped imploringly. [...] "Oh, I thought you'd never come! I was skeered I'd die <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> here--die {{and go to}} hell. I didn't know before today that I was dying. None of those cowards would tell me. Can you help me?" ...|$|E
