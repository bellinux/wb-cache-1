I didn't have any <b>brothers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought that's {{something}} I can do, one way I can make a contribution. My sisters thought it was great, but they were not interested. There was too much discipline and routine involved. I felt like it would be a challenge, to step forth and do it, to see what it was all about. It gave a sense of confidence. At the time girls just didn't join the WAVES or go into the military. But my Dad, he said, you'll be OK".|$|E
500|$|Jennings {{offered to}} record [...] "Willy the Wandering Gypsy and Me" [...] and told Shaver to sing another song – if Jennings liked it he would record it and Shaver could sing another; {{but if he}} did not like it, Shaver would have to leave. Shaver sang [...] "Ain't No God in Mexico", {{followed}} by [...] "Honky Tonk Heroes" [...] and [...] "Old Five and Dimers and Me". [...] Jennings was so taken with Shaver's tunes that he decided he would record an album consisting solely of the Texan's songs. [...] RCA producer Chet Atkins was reluctant to record the material of an unknown writer, but since he had creative control, Jennings decided to record the album anyway, although the executives of RCA Records delayed its release. [...] Jennings was also spending more of his time at Tompall Glaser's [...] "Hillbilly Central" [...] studio at 916 Nineteenth Avenue South in Nashville, attracted by the laid back, communal atmosphere that was the antitheses of the traditional setup that Jennings had endured at RCA since 1966. [...] Jennings brought Glaser back with him to RCA Victor Studios to co-produce Honky Tonk Heroes. [...] "Tompall and I were best friends," [...] Jennings reminisced in the audio version of his autobiography Waylon. [...] "We met at about the time he broke up with his <b>brothers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> kind of took their place in his life." [...] Jennings and Shaver worked on the songs for several weeks, with [...] Shaver believing that Jennings was not closely following the phrasing of the tunes, and in some cases he played the songs repeatedly so that Jennings would understand them. [...] The title cut was especially problematic, with Jennings and Shaver - both temperamental personalities - clashing over the arrangement. [...] In Michael Striessguth's book Outlaw: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville, Jennings drummer Richie Albright recalls: ...|$|E

2500|$|Along {{with the}} Italian poems, Solomos {{made his first}} {{attempts}} to write in Greek. [...] This was a difficult task for the young poet, since his education was classical and in Italian, but also because there did not exist any poetic works written in the demotic dialect that could have served as models. [...] However, {{the fact that his}} education in Greek was minimal kept him free of any scholarly influences, that might have led him to write in katharevousa, a [...] "purist" [...] language formulated as a simpler form of ancient Greek. Instead he wrote {{in the language of the}} common people of his native island. [...] In order to ameliorate his language skills, he started studying methodically demotic songs, the works of pre-solomian poets (προσολωμικοί ποιητές) and popular and Cretan literature that at that time constituted the best samples of the use of the demotic dialect in modern Greek literature.The result was the first extensive body of literature written in the demotic dialect, a move whose influence on subsequent writers cannot be overstated. [...] Poems dating to that period of time are I Xanthoula-The little blond girl, I Agnoristi-The Unrecognizable, Ta dyo aderfia-The two <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> trelli mana-The mad mother.|$|E

My cousins, and <b>brothers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when. I {{want to tell you that}} some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want to say now. Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E
