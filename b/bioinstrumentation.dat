50|$|Many ground {{tests were}} carried out on the Gemini 2 and Titan rocket in November 1964. On November 24, Gemini-Titan (GT) 2 {{successfully}} completed the Wet Mock Simulated Launch, a full-scale countdown exercise which included propellant loading. Procedures for flight crew suiting and spacecraft ingress and egress were practiced during simulated launch. The prime flight crew for Gemini 3 donned pressure suits and full biomedical instrumentation, assisted by their backup crew and the space suit <b>bioinstrumentation</b> and aeromedical personnel who would participate in the GT-3 launch operation. As {{a result of this}} practice operation, it was established that all physical examinations, <b>bioinstrumentation</b> sensor attachment, and suit donning would be done in the pilot ready room at Launch Complex 16.|$|E

50|$|Like Glenn, Carpenter {{circled the}} Earth three times. Total time weightless 4 h 39 min 32 s. The {{performance}} of the Mercury spacecraft and Atlas launch vehicle was excellent in nearly every respect. All primary mission objectives were achieved. The single mission-critical malfunction which occurred involved a failure in the spacecraft pitch horizon scanner, {{a component of the}} automatic control system. This anomaly was adequately compensated for by the pilot in subsequent in-flight operations so that the success of the mission was not compromised. A modification of the spacecraft control-system thrust units was effective. Cabin and pressure-suit temperatures were high but not intolerable. Some uncertainties in the data telemetered from the <b>bioinstrumentation</b> prevailed at times during the flight; however, associated information was available which indicated continued well-being of the astronaut.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – A cross-course design {{experience}} is an {{efficient way to}} stitch together two concurrent, singlesemester courses to obtain a meaningful number of design credits without unduly increasing a student’s overall load. This paper addresses a project that joined the design credits from two Kansas State University (KSU) courses: ECE 773 – <b>Bioinstrumentation</b> Design Laboratory and ECE 502 – Electronics Laboratory. The goal of each project team was to design, build, and demonstrate a two-channel bioamplifier that is functionally similar to a commercial bioamplifier used in the KSU AP 773 – <b>Bioinstrumentation</b> Laboratory course taken by some of these students. Assessment of the experience was provided via a post-project survey that addressed eight learning objectives, learning in 23 technical areas, project administration, and the overall experience. Survey results were positive across the board. Though the time commitment was significant, the students appreciated the opportunity to work on a complex system that required their collective expertise.

40|$|Animal senses cover a {{broad range}} of signal types and signal bandwidths and have {{inspired}} various sensors and <b>bioinstrumentation</b> devices for biological and medical applications. Insects, such as desert ants and honeybees, for example, utilize polarized skylight pattern-based information in their navigation activities. They reliably return to their nests and hives from places many kilometers away. The insect navigation system involves the dorsal rim area in their compound eyes and the corresponding polarization sensitive neurons in the brain. The dorsal rim area is equipped with photoreceptors, which have orthogonally arranged small hair-like structures termed microvilli. These are the specialized sensors for the detection of polarized skylight patterns (e-vector orientation). Various research groups have been working on the development of novel navigation systems inspired by polarized skylight-based navigation in animals. Their major contributions are critically reviewed.

40|$|Medical jet injection, {{in which}} a narrow fluid drug stream is {{propelled}} into the skin without a needle, was first conceived in the 1940 s [1]. However, a major drawback of most injectors {{is the lack of}} controllability of jet parameters. Recent work at the <b>BioInstrumentation</b> Laboratory at MIT has resulted in a tunable, high-performance linear Lorentz-force jet injector which allows for careful control of many injection variables. The sensor presented in this thesis further improves the ability to quantify and control contact forces between the injection nozzle and tissue. This sensor uses a three-spoke flexure system with full-bridge strain gauge assemblies mounted on each flexural arm to measure both normal and lateral forces applied to the nozzle. The design, fabrication, calibration, and validation for the sensor are detailed along with results for preliminary tissue injections into ex vivo porcine tissue. These preliminary tests showed higher percent volume delivery to the tissue with an elevated normal force. Under normal forces of 4 to 8 N, the <b>BioInstrumentation</b> Lab's jet injector achieved percent volume delivery of 89. 1 ± 5. 1 %, whereas with normal forces of 0 to 4 N, the percent volume delivery was 68. 9 ± 12. 7 %. by Nickolas Peter Demas.

40|$|In {{the past}} years, the <b>BioInstrumentation</b> Lab has {{developed}} a handheld needle-free jet injector based on a custom Lorentz-force motor. While the current handheld design is effective as a research tool, many improvements are needed {{before it can be}} a commercially viable product for individual human use. Improvements in various aspects of the design have been implemented. A Hall effect sensor and a thermopile were added to provide critical safety and quality monitoring of the Lorentz-force motor, and a linear encoder provided increased position resolution. Flexible coil elements reduced drag on the coil while eliminating a mechanical failure mode caused by moving cables. A low cost optical encoder system has been implemented to provide 5 pm position resolution for the actuator and this has improved error of volume ejections to 0. 3 pL. All these improvements have also been proved to be scalable by their implementation on a scaled down design of the current actuator. This actuator was modeled and verified to have approximately half the force output of the current actuator, and is small and light enough to be packaged in a portable device. Lastly, an adaptor that allows extraction of drug out of a vial using the <b>BioInstrumentation</b> Lab's needle-free injector has been developed as well as an automatic detection scheme that expels any air drawn in by this extraction process with minimal fluid loss. by Ashin Modak.

40|$|The <b>Bioinstrumentation</b> Laboratory {{belongs to}} the Centre for Biomedical Technology (CTB) of the Technical University of Madrid and its main {{objective}} is to provide the scientific community with devices and techniques for the characterization of micro and nanostructures and consequently finding their best biomedical applications. Hyperthermia (greek word for “overheating”) {{is defined as the}} phenomenon that occurs when a body is exposed to an energy generating source that can produce a rise in temperature (42 - 45 ºC) for a given time [1]. Specifically, the aim of the hyperthermia methods used in The <b>Bioinstrumentation</b> Laboratory is the development of thermal therapies, some of these using different kinds of nanoparticles, to kill cancer cells and reduce the damage on healthy tissues. The optical hyperthermia is based on noble metal nanoparticles and laser irradiation. This kind of nanoparticles has an immense potential associated to the development of therapies for cancer on account of their Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) enhanced light scattering and absorption. In a short period of time, the absorbed light is converted into localized heat, so we can take advantage of these characteristics to heat up tumor cells in order to obtain the cellular death [2]. In this case, the laboratory has an optical hyperthermia device based on a continuous wave laser used to kill glioblastoma cell lines (1321 N 1) in the presence of gold nanorods (Figure 1 a). The wavelength of the laser light is 808 nm because the penetration of the light in the tissue is deeper in the Near Infrared Region. The first optical hyperthermia results show that the laser irradiation produces cellular death in the experimental samples of glioblastoma cell lines using gold nanorods but is not able to decrease the cellular viability of cancer cells in samples without the suitable nanorods (Figure 1 b) [3]. The generation of magnetic hyperthermia is performed through changes of the magnetic induction in magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) that are embedded in viscous medium. The Figure 2 shows a schematic design of the AC induction hyperthermia device in magnetic fluids. The equipment has been manufactured at The <b>Bioinstrumentation</b> Laboratory. The first block implies two steps: the signal selection with frequency manipulation option from 9 KHz to 2 MHz, and a linear output up to 1500 W. The second block is where magnetic field is generated (5 mm, 10 turns). Finally, the third block is a software control where the user can establish initial parameters, and also shows the temperature response of MNPs due to the magnetic field applied [4 - 8]. The <b>Bioinstrumentation</b> Laboratory in collaboration with the Mexican company MRI-DT have recently implemented a new research line on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Hyperthermia, which is sustained on the patent US 7, 423, 429 B 2 owned by this company. This investigation is based on the use of clinical MRI equipment not only for diagnosis but for therapy [9]. This idea consists of two main facts: Magnetic Resonance Imaging can cause focal heating [10], and the differentiation in resonant frequency between healthy and cancer cells [11]. To produce only heating in cancer cells when the whole body is irradiated, it is necessary to determine the specific resonant frequency of the target, using the information contained in the spectra of the area of interest. Then, special RF pulse sequence is applied to produce fast excitation and relaxation mechanism that generates temperature increase of the tumor, causing cellular death or metabolism malfunction that stops cellular divisio...|$|E
