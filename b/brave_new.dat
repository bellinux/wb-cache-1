Dickinson insisted that they find a replacement for the now retired Martin Birch, the band's regular producer, and record in a different studio {{than the one in}} which they made No Prayer for the Dying and Fear of the Dark, to which Harris agreed. The album was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris with producer Kevin Shirley, after which Iron Maiden undertook a supporting tour culminating with a performance at the Rock in Rio festival before a crowd of 250,000.|$|E

Also included on the bill were Kiss, David Lee Roth, Megadeth, Guns N' Roses and Helloween. The festival was marred, however, by the deaths of two fans in a crowd-surge during the aforementioned Guns N' Roses performance; {{the following}} year's festival was cancelled as a result. The tour concluded with several headline shows in the UK in November and December 1988, with the concerts at the NEC Arena, Birmingham recorded for a live video, entitled Maiden England. Throughout the tour, Harris' bass technician, Michael Kenney, provided live keyboards. Kenney has acted as the band's live keyboard player ever since, also performing on the band's four following albums before Harris took over as the group's sole studio keyboardist from 2000's <b>Brave</b> <b>New</b> World.|$|E

25|$|<b>Brave</b> <b>New</b> World is a dystopian novel {{written in}} 1931 by English author Aldous Huxley, and {{published}} in 1932. Set in London in the year AD 2540 (632 A.F.—"After Ford"—in the book), the novel anticipates developments in reproductive technology, sleep-learning, psychological manipulation, and classical conditioning that are combined to make a profound change in society. Huxley followed this book with a reassessment in an essay, <b>Brave</b> <b>New</b> World Revisited (1958), and with Island (1962), his final novel.|$|E

25|$|Huxley wrote <b>Brave</b> <b>New</b> World {{while living}} in Sanary-sur-Mer, France, in the four months from May to August 1931. By this time, Huxley had already {{established}} himself as a writer and social satirist. He was a contributor to Vanity Fair and Vogue magazines, and had published a collection of his poetry (The Burning Wheel, 1916) and four successful satirical novels: Crome Yellow (1921), Antic Hay (1923), Those Barren Leaves (1925), and Point Counter Point (1928). <b>Brave</b> <b>New</b> World was Huxley's fifth novel and first dystopian work.|$|E
25|$|In {{the decades}} since the {{publication}} of Nineteen Eighty-Four, there have been numerous comparisons to the Aldous Huxley's novel <b>Brave</b> <b>New</b> World, which had been published 17 years earlier, in 1932.

However, members of the ruling class of Nineteen Eighty-Four use brutal force, torture and mind control to keep individuals in line, but rulers in <b>Brave</b> <b>New</b> World keep the citizens in line by addictive drugs and pleasurable distractions.|$|E
