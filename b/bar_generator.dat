40|$|Abstract. Color <b>bar</b> signal <b>generator</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} measurements for PAL TV applications. However, its use in resource constrained applications such as color TV video adjustment is limited because of the high architecture complexity involved. Due to the broad range of applications presently offered by FPGA (filed programmable gate array), their use has become increasingly widespread in different areas and sectors. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a color <b>bar</b> signal <b>generator</b> based on FPGA and MC 1377 with a high performance and low system complexity. The FPGA technology proved to be a proper platform to meet these two contrasting requirements. The signal structure, generation principle, and FPGA implementation of composite PAL synchronize signal and RGB color signal are described. The interface circuits, hardware and software of the system are introduced. The software is simulated using MAXplus platform. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness and stability of the signal generator...|$|R

It delivers a high voltage (54 kV). The same measurement setup is used for the two specimens. A wideband antenna is linked to the TDS 6124 C digital oscilloscope, which is set with a sampling frequency twice larger than the maximum frequency of the antenna. For example, 2.5 GS/s sampling frequency is used when the biconical antenna (30 - 300 MHz) is used, and 10 GS/s is used for the Wi-Fi antenna (2.4 GHz, 2 dBi).

40|$|In {{order to}} detect the {{degradation}} of high voltage machine insulation, partial discharge (PD) measure-ments are often used. While certain defects can be identified by PD measurements a correlation between PD activity and remaining insulation life or immanent insulation failure has {{so far not been}} convincingly demonstrated. As former investigations show, the main electrical degradation process of <b>generator</b> <b>bars</b> is electrical treeing. The electrical treeing and the PD generated thereby have therefore been investigated on <b>generator</b> <b>bar</b> insulations. The results show that treeing mainly causes delamination within the material. Dis-charges in such delaminations lead to a rise in apparent charge, maximum apparent charge and cumulated charge. The measured apparent charge could be calcu-lated from the size of deterioration structures as ob-served in micrographs. The cumulated charge shows a characteristic bend that occurs by a change from lower to higher PD. Higher PD values are usually caused by serious material degradation. The bend in the curve of cumulated charge depends on the material and takes place between 4 % and 41 % of the total time to breakdown. It may be used as a criterion for paying more attention to the survey of the material or for consideration of repair work...|$|R

The phenomenon has already been studied for different high-voltage substations [2, 3, 18]. For example, the power line with the highest voltage gives the more significant corona noise according to Pakala works. So it is obvious that to obtain a more powerful partial discharge signal, we have to feed the specimen with a higher voltage which is not always possible in laboratory.|$|R

These results were compared with those recorded testing <b>bars</b> of HV <b>generators</b> manufactured with resin-rich insulation technology and adopted as reference patterns in current guides or technical specifications. Comparison of PD patterns resulting from the degradation of components manufactured using different insulation technologies e. g., taped or varnished stress grading, shows different features.

40|$|Abstract: The work {{presented}} {{has been}} carried out to obtain a better insight into electrical aging phenomena of mica insulation as used in high voltage rotating machines. Model bars with typical insulating materials were exposed to standard electrical aging and stimu-lated tree propagation at a new electrode arrangement. The results show that time to breakdown under elec-trical load is mainly determined by electrical treeing. Tree growth must be considered to start at the same instant voltage is being applied. Micrographs show that the tree propagates mainly along the interface binder resin-mica-carrier material. If the mica layer is damaged the tree can also penetrate the mica tape itself. Higher breakdown time values were measured at insulation materials with higher mica content and a higher number of thinner tape layers. To judge from the results, electrical tree growth manifests itself as the main process of electrical aging. Further research for advanced materials and improved application proc-esses in <b>generator</b> <b>bar</b> manufacturing has therefore to be focused on electrical treeing...|$|R

50|$|The {{flammability}} limits (4-75% {{of hydrogen}} in air at normal temperature, wider at high temperatures), its autoignition temperature at 571 °C, its very low minimum ignition energy, and its tendency to form explosive mixtures with air, require provisions {{to be made}} for maintaining the hydrogen content within the generator above the upper or below the flammability limit at all times, and other hydrogen safety measures. When filled with hydrogen, overpressure has to be maintained as inlet of air into the generator could cause a dangerous explosion in confined space. The generator enclosure is purged before opening it for maintenance, and before refilling the generator with hydrogen. During shutdown, hydrogen is purged by an inert gas, then the inert gas is replaced by air; the opposite sequence is used before startup. Carbon dioxide or nitrogen can be used for this purpose, as they do not form combustible mixtures with hydrogen and are inexpensive. Gas purity sensors are used to indicate the end of the purging cycle, which shortens the startup and shutdown times and reduces consumption of the purging gas. Carbon dioxide is favored as due to the very high density difference it easily displaces the hydrogen. The carbon dioxide is admitted {{to the bottom of the}} generator first, pushing the hydrogen out at the top. Then air is admitted to the top, pushing the carbon dioxide out at the bottom. Purging is best done with the generator stopped. If done on <b>barring,</b> the <b>generator</b> fans will mix the gases and greatly increase the time required to achieve purity.|$|R
40|$|Unsteady {{flow and}} its effects on the {{boundary}} layers of a low pressure turbine blade is complex in nature. The flow encountered in a low pressure turbine contains unstructured freestream turbulence as well as structured periodic perturbations caused by upstream vane row wake shedding. Researchers have shown that these conditions strongly influence turbine blade performance and boundary layer separation, especially at low Reynolds numbers. In order to simulate these realistic engine conditions and to study the effects of periodic unsteadiness, a moving <b>bar</b> wake <b>generator</b> has been designed and characterized for use in the Air Force Research Labs (AFRL) low speed wind tunnel. The layout is similar to other traditional squirrel cage designs, however, the entire wake generator, {{with the exception of the}} motor, is enclosed inside the wind tunnel up-stream of a linear cascade. A unique aspect of the wake generator design is the inclusion of a delay loop in the wake generator track. The delay loop avoids backwards running secondary wakes that are caused by the wake generating mechanism making a reverse traverse across the wind tunnel during each cycle. The effect of the periodic disturbances on turbine blade performance has been investigated at low Reynolds numbers (Re < 5 x 104) using the highly loaded, AFRL designed L 1 A low pressure turbine profile. The momentum deficit along with wake width and peak velocity deficit were used to quantify the wakes shed from the wake generating device. These properties along with the integrated wake total pressure loss were then used to quantify the profile loss of the L 1 A in the presence of unsteady wakes...|$|R

In the targeted attack the edge with the maximum centrality value is disconnected from the network. A number of metrics including {{the size of the}} largest connected component, the number of failed edges, the average maximum flow and the global efficiency are studied as a function of capacity parameter (edge critical load is proportional to its capacity parameter and nominal centrality value).

The layout is similar to other traditional squirrel cage designs, however, the entire wake generator is enclosed inside the wind tunnel, up-stream of a linear cascade. The wake shed from the wake generator was characterized by its momentum deficit, wake width, and peak velocity deficit. It is shown that the wakes produce a periodic unsteadiness that is consistent with other wake generator designs. The effect of the periodic disturbances on turbine blade performance has been investigated at low Reynolds number using the highly loaded, AFRL designed L 1 A low pressure turbine profile. Wake loss measurements, pressure coefficient distribution, and particle image velocimetry was used to quantify the L 1 A blade performance with unsteady wakes at a Reynolds number of 25, 000 with 0. 5 % and 3. 4 % free-stream turbulence. Wake loss data showed that the inclusion of periodic wakes reduced the profile losses by 56 % compared to steady flow losses. Previous pressure coefficient distributions showed that the L 1 A blade profile, under steady flow conditions, has non-reattaching separated flow along the suction surface. With the inclusion of the periodic wakes, the pressure coefficient profile revealed that the flow separation had been dramatically reduced to a small separation bubble. The wake passing event was split into six phases and captured using two-dimensional planer PIV. The interaction between the passing wakes and the separation bubble was noted. The bubble was observed to grow in size between passing wakes, but was only able to achieve a fraction of the original level of separation. The streamlines through the unrestricted blade passage were able to better follow the blade profile, indicating an improved exit flow angle with lower losses. The data shows that the wake generator was successfully implemented into the wind tunnel and is able to properly simulate blade row interactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of mechanical properties by oxide films {{has been documented}} and studied for decades. Among these studies, Campbell proposed that tangled thin oxides created during the filling of a mould become flattened or acquire a spherical shape because of several processes: the penetration of dissolved hydrogen from the liquid aluminium into the bifilm during solidification, the pushing of oxides by dendrites during solidification, the growth of heterogeneously nucleated intermetallic faces upon the wetted oxide side, and shrinkage that pulls oxides. This proposal has been argued from a theoretical standpoint; however, {{there is no direct}} experimental evidence to support it. This work attempts to build an experimental procedure to obtain experimental evidence for the proposal. To obtain aluminium bifilms smaller than 3 mm in 12 -mm diameter specimen <b>bars,</b> an oxide <b>generator</b> was designed using a gating system. Micro X-ray tomography (Skyscan 1702) was used to establish the best specimen diameter and scanning conditions, including exposure time, magnification, rotation angle and rotation-step angle. Following scanning, the specimens were re-melted for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 minutes at 745 °C, and then quenched in the air until solidified. They were then re-scanned to establish the changes in their defect morphologies. In the experiments, the maximum scanning exposure time, minimum rotation step angle, maximum magnification, minimize specimen size and centring of the specimen on the specimen holder were important to obtain the best detail in the topographical results. In addition, adjusting the threshold level had an important effect on the volumetric analysis. This research could not use a re-melting method. However, in a comparison before and after re-melting processes, the surface connected defects did not change their shape. Hydrogen penetration and intermetallic effects could not be observed in this experiment. However, dendrite pushing and shrinkage could be observed...|$|R
