500|$|The {{action of}} the 1960s Century 21 mini-album Introducing Captain Scarlet (MA 131), written by Angus P. Allan, takes place shortly before the final scene of [...] "The Mysterons". Comprised partly of a re-telling of the TV episode (provided by {{excerpts}} from the soundtrack), and partly of an original story, {{the premise of the}} 21-minute audio drama is that the World Security Council (WSC) is holding an inquiry into the events following the disastrous conclusion to the Zero-X mission to Mars. The episode closes with the discovery that the Captain Scarlet duplicate has mysteriously recovered from its mortal injuries, and Cloudbase chief medical officer Dr Fawn's expressed belief that Scarlet's allegiance to Earth can be restored <b>by</b> <b>interfacing</b> his Mysteron body with an advanced computer (a plot device that was ultimately not used in {{the final version of the}} TV episode's shooting script).|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Mass Effect 2: Overlord", elite human soldier Commander Shepard is sent on {{a mission}} to {{investigate}} a Cerberus research base that has gone silent. The base is located on the surface of an Earth-like planet called Aite. Upon arriving at the facility, Shepard is informed that an experimental virtual intelligence has gone rogue and is ordered to destroy an antenna inside a transmission dish before the virtual intelligence uploads a program off-planet. Shepard successfully destroys the antenna and is then met by Dr. Gavin Archer, the scientist that is responsible for the situation. Archer explains that they were trying to gain influence over a hostile race of networked artificial intelligences called the geth <b>by</b> <b>interfacing</b> a human mind with a virtual intelligence. In the process, the virtual intelligence overpowered the test subject's mind, Archer's brother David, and has evolved into a virus.|$|E

2500|$|EEG {{measures}} the gross electrical {{activity of the}} brain that can be observed {{on the surface of the}} skull. In the metastability theory, EEG outputs produce oscillations that can be described as having identifiable patterns that correlate with each other at certain frequencies. [...] Each neuron in a neuronal network normally outputs a dynamical oscillatory waveform, but also has the ability to output a chaotic waveform. [...] When neurons are integrated into the neural network <b>by</b> <b>interfacing</b> neurons with each other, the dynamical oscillations created by each neuron can be combined to form highly predictable EEG oscillations.|$|E
2500|$|The Vision is {{described}} as being [...] "every inch a human being—except that all of his bodily organs are constructed of synthetic materials." [...] The Solar Jewel on the Vision's forehead absorbs ambient solar energy to provide the power needed for him to function, and he is also capable of discharging this energy as optic beams; with this, he can fire beams of infrared and microwave radiation. In extreme cases he can discharge this same power through the Solar Jewel itself which amplifies its destructive effects considerably, albeit {{at the cost of}} losing most of his resources. <b>By</b> <b>interfacing</b> with an unknown dimension to which he can shunt and from which he can accrue mass, thus becoming either intangible or extraordinarily massive, the Vision can change his density, which at its lowest allows flight and a ghostly, phasing intangibility, and at its heaviest, a density ten times greater than that of depleted uranium, which gives him superhuman strength, immovability, and a diamond-hard near invulnerability. On one occasion, the Vision uses this extreme density to render unconscious the villain Count Nefaria; at other times, he thrusts an intangible hand into them and then partially re-materializes it, a process he describes as [...] "physical disruption." [...] This effect typically causes great pain and results in incapacitation, as when used against the Earth-712 version of the hero Hyperion. Being an artificial life-form/android of sorts, the Vision has superhuman senses, superhuman stamina, reflexes, speed, agility, strength (even without being at high density), superhuman analytical capabilities, and the ability to process information and make calculations with superhuman speed and accuracy. The Vision was trained in hand-to-hand combat by Captain America, is an expert in the combat use of his superhuman powers, and is a highly skilled tactician and strategist. The Vision is an expert on his own construction and repair.|$|E

40|$|The rate of curvature-driven {{grain growth}} in {{polycrystalline}} materials is well-known {{to be limited}} <b>by</b> <b>interface</b> dissipation. We show analytically and by simulations that, for systems forming modulated phases or non-equilibrium patterns with crystal ordering, growth is limited by bulk dissipation associated with lattice translation, which dramatically slows down grain coarsening. We also show that bulk dissipation is reduced by thermal noise so that those systems exhibit faster coarsening behavior dominated <b>by</b> <b>interface</b> dissipation for high Peierls barrier and high noise.
