5|$|All bovids {{have the}} similar basic form - a snout with a <b>blunt</b> <b>end,</b> {{one or more}} pairs of horns (generally present on males) {{immediately}} after the oval or pointed ears, a distinct neck and limbs, and a tail varying in length and bushiness among the species. Most bovids exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males usually larger as well as heavier than females. Sexual dimorphism is more prominent in medium- to large-sized bovids. All bovids have four toes on each foot – they walk on the central two (the hooves), while the outer two (the dewclaws) are much smaller and rarely touch the ground.|$|E
25|$|In dense colonies, {{there is}} much faeces, however the {{majority}} of faecal contamination is on the pointed end of the egg, therefore the <b>blunt</b> <b>end</b> is cleaner where the chick emerges.|$|E
25|$|The X-15 had a thick wedge tail {{to enable}} it to fly in a steady manner at {{hypersonic}} speeds. This produced {{a significant amount of}} drag at lower speeds; the <b>blunt</b> <b>end</b> {{at the rear of the}} X-15 could produce as much drag as an entire F-104 Starfighter.|$|E
50|$|An effect {{similar to}} coaxial {{stacking}} {{has been observed}} in rationally designed DNA structures. DNA origami structures contain {{a large number of}} double helixes with exposed <b>blunt</b> <b>ends.</b> These structures were observed to stick together along the edges that contained these exposed <b>blunt</b> <b>ends,</b> due to the hydrophobic stacking interactions.|$|R
50|$|Ligase {{will also}} work with <b>blunt</b> <b>ends,</b> {{although}} higher enzyme concentrations and different reaction conditions are required.|$|R
5000|$|DNA ends {{refer to}} the {{properties}} of the end of DNA molecules, which may be sticky <b>ends</b> (cohesive <b>ends),</b> <b>blunt</b> <b>ends</b> or in other forms. The concept is used in molecular biology, especially in cloning or when subcloning inserts DNA into vector DNA. Such ends may be generated by restriction enzymes that cut the DNA - a staggered cut generates two sticky ends, while a straight cut generate <b>blunt</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R
25|$|The PAM {{sequence}} {{appears to}} be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nt of the protospacer. This nt becomes the final base in the first direct repeat. This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs in other organisms do not show {{the same level of}} conservation in the final position. It is likely that in those systems, a <b>blunt</b> <b>end</b> is generated {{at the very end of}} the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition.|$|E
500|$|In this pathway, a three-subunit enzyme complex called RecBCD initiates {{recombination}} by binding to a blunt {{or nearly}} <b>blunt</b> <b>end</b> of {{a break in}} double-strand DNA. [...] After RecBCD binds the DNA end, the RecB and RecD subunits begin unzipping the DNA duplex through helicase activity. [...] The RecB subunit also has a nuclease domain, which cuts the single strand of DNA that emerges from the unzipping process. [...] This unzipping continues until RecBCD encounters a specific nucleotide sequence (5'-GCTGGTGG-3') known as a Chi site.|$|E
500|$|The Navy went to Emerson, who {{designed}} and fabricated a working prototype within 24hours. They {{found that it}} met their needs, and the model was dubbed the [...] "SARK" [...] (Search and Rescue Knife). The SARK is a folding knife with a wharncliffe-style blade and a blunt tip designed so a rescuer could cut trapped victims free without stabbing them. The knife features Emerson's Wave. Seeing another need in the police community, Emerson replaced the <b>blunt</b> <b>end</b> of the SARK with a pointed end and named it the [...] "P-SARK", or Police Search And Rescue Knife. [...] In 2005, the Navy changed the requirements on the SARK to incorporate a guthook {{on the back of}} the blade for use as a line-cutter. [...] Emerson made the change on this model which is only available to the US Navy and the model designation is the NSAR (Navy Search And Rescue) Knife.|$|E

2500|$|The short-tailed {{albatross}} lays {{a clutch}} of one egg that is dirty white, with red spots, mainly at the <b>blunt</b> <b>end</b> of the egg. It usually measures [...] The egg is incubated for around 65 days. Both sexes incubate the eggs.|$|E
2500|$|Senior Corporal Darryl Bolke, {{a police}} officer of the Ontario Police Department, {{approached}} Emerson {{and asked for a}} modification to the SARK. Bolke's request was to make the tip of the blade pointed rather than blunt. Emerson replaced the <b>blunt</b> <b>end</b> of the SARK with a pointed end and named it the [...] "P-SARK", or Police Search And Rescue Knife. Bolke wrote the knife policy for his department, {{the first of its kind}} in the United States. The P-SARK has been adopted by a number of law enforcement agencies since that time.|$|E
2500|$|Authentic Aboriginal didgeridoos are {{produced}} in traditionally oriented communities in Northern Australia or by makers who travel to Central and Northern Australia {{to collect the}} raw materials. They are usually made from hardwoods, especially the various eucalyptus species that are endemic to the region. Generally the main trunk of the tree is harvested, though a substantial branch may be used instead. Aboriginal didgeridoo craftsmen hunt for suitably hollow live trees in areas with obvious termite activity. Termites attack these living eucalyptus trees, removing only the dead heartwood of the tree, as the living sapwood contains a chemical that repels the insects. [...] Various techniques are employed to find trees with a suitable hollow, including knowledge of landscape and termite activity patterns, {{and a kind of}} tap or knock test, in which the bark of the tree is peeled back, and a fingernail or the <b>blunt</b> <b>end</b> of a tool, such as an axe is knocked against the wood to determine if the hollow produces the right resonance.|$|E

2500|$|Engineers {{often use}} dyes in water or smoke in air {{in order to}} see streaklines, from which pathlines can be calculated. Streaklines are {{identical}} to streamlines for steady flow. Further, dye can be used to create timelines. The patterns guide their design modifications, aiming to reduce the drag. This task is known as streamlining, and the resulting design is referred to as being streamlined. Streamlined objects and organisms, like steam locomotives, streamliners, cars and dolphins are often aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The Streamline Moderne style, an 1930s and 1940s offshoot of Art Deco, brought flowing lines to architecture and design of the era. [...] The canonical example of a streamlined shape is a chicken egg with the <b>blunt</b> <b>end</b> facing forwards. [...] This shows clearly that the curvature of the front surface can be much steeper than the back of the object. [...] Most drag is caused by eddies in the fluid behind the moving object, and the objective should be to allow the fluid to slow down after passing around the object, and regain pressure, without forming eddies.|$|E
2500|$|Laying {{usually takes}} place in May. The clutch numbers three to nine eggs, {{typically}} around seven, with North American clutches tending to be larger on average than European ones. If a second clutch is produced in one breeding season, it is smaller than the first one. The eggs have a white background colour, usually with a grey hue and sometimes with a blue one; they are patterned with blotches of yellowish- to reddish-brown and purplish-grey, often denser around the <b>blunt</b> <b>end.</b> They measure around [...] in length and [...] in width. Incubation takes around 16 days but may be closer to three weeks for large clutches; it is generally done only by the female. While the male may briefly take over incubating, his task during this time is to provide food. The altricial nestlings hatch naked, blind and pink-skinned, weighing c. their skin turns darker after a few days. The inside of their beak is pink and they probably lack spots or other prominent marks; the wattles {{at the corners of}} the mouth are yellow as in many passerines. As the nestlings grow, the female broods them, and later on assists in providing food. The young fledge after 2–3 weeks, typically in late June or early July; they become independent of their parents about 3–6 weeks later. Sometimes, a parent will single out particular fledglings (possibly the weakest ones) and focus their care and feeding on these during this time. Other adults have occasionally been recorded assisting in feeding a pair's offspring; {{it is not clear whether}} these helpers at the nest are offspring of previous years, or unrelated non-breeding [...] "floaters" [...] or breeding neighbours.|$|E
2500|$|Significant {{contributors}} to the impending Union disaster were {{the nature of the}} Union XI Corps and the incompetent performance of its commander, Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard. Howard failed to make any provision for defending against a surprise attack, even though Hooker had ordered him to do so. The Union right flank was not anchored on any natural obstacle, and the only defenses against a flank attack consisted of two cannons pointing out into the Wilderness. Also, the XI Corps was an organization with poor morale. The corps had originally been commanded by Brig. Gen. Franz Sigel, a political general appointed because of his abolitionist views. Although inept as a commander, he was very popular with the Germans and the immigrant soldiers had a saying [...] "I fights mit Sigel". During the spring of 1862, Sigel's corps was detached from the main Army of the Potomac and placed in the Shenandoah Valley, where it was later defeated by Stonewall Jackson's forces at Cross Keys. After the Peninsula Campaign against Richmond, it was attached to Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia where it fared no better, delivering a poor performance at Second Bull Run. The XI Corps did not participate in the Antietam or Fredericksburg campaigns, and after Hooker took command of the army Sigel was dismissed and replaced by Howard. He dismissed a number of popular generals and replaced them with men like Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow, a ferocious disciplinarian who was known for swatting stragglers with the <b>blunt</b> <b>end</b> of his sword. Many of the immigrants had poor English language skills and they were subjected to ethnic friction {{with the rest of the}} Army of the Potomac, where all non-Irish immigrants were referred to as [...] "Germans". In fact, half the XI Corps consisted of native-born Americans, mostly from the Midwest, but it was the immigrants with whom the corps came to be associated. The corps' readiness was poor as well. Of the 23 regiments, eight had no combat experience, and the remaining 15 had never fought on the winning side of a battle. And although many of the immigrants had served in European armies, they tended to not perform well under the loose discipline of the American volunteer military. Because of these factors, Hooker had placed the XI Corps on his flank and did not have any major plans for it except as a reserve or mopping-up force after the main fighting was over.|$|E

5000|$|The {{blade profile}} of {{propellers}} designed {{to operate in}} a ventilated condition is often not of an aerofoil section and is a <b>blunt</b> <b>ended</b> taper instead. These are often known as [...] "chopper" [...] type propellers.|$|R
5000|$|Young schizonts are {{elongate}} with <b>blunt</b> <b>ends</b> {{and become}} oval or round following the second nuclear division. Mature schizonts {{are smaller than}} the host cell nuclei, produce 4-12 merozoites and are usually arranged as a fan.|$|R
6000|$|... 1499. But, as {{has long}} been recognised, the small ball is only a <b>blunt</b> <b>end,</b> and, {{electrically}} speaking, a point only a small ball; so that when a point or <b>blunt</b> <b>end</b> is throwing out its brushes into the air, it is acting exactly as the small balls have acted in the experiments already described, and {{by virtue of the}} same properties and relations.|$|E

60|$|The genus Anelasma is, I think, {{properly}} placed between Alepas and Ibla.

5000|$|A sticky or {{cohesive}} end has protruding single-stranded strands with unpaired nucleotides called overhangs, each overhang can anneal with another complementary one to form base pairs. The two complementary {{cohesive end}}s of DNA can anneal together via hydrogen bonding, {{the stability of}} these paired ends depends on the melting temperature of the paired overhangs. DNA ligase can join two adjacent strands of DNA by forming a covalent bond between the sugar-phosphate moieties of adjacent nucleotides to join the two together via a phosphodiester bond in a process called ligation. The <b>blunt</b> <b>ends</b> however do not have such protruding strands, and therefore cannot anneal together, and consequently ligation between <b>blunt</b> <b>ends</b> is less efficient.|$|R
