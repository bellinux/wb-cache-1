5|$|<b>Birth</b> <b>control,</b> {{also known}} as {{contraception}} and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. <b>Birth</b> <b>control</b> has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> only became available in the 20th century. Planning, making available, and using <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> is called family planning. Some cultures limit or discourage access to <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> because they consider it to be morally, religiously, or politically undesirable.|$|E
5|$|For {{individuals}} with specific health problems, {{certain forms of}} <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> may require further investigations. For women who are otherwise healthy, many methods of <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> should not require a medical exam—including <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> pills, injectable or implantable <b>birth</b> <b>control,</b> and condoms. For example, a pelvic exam, breast exam, or blood test before starting <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> pills {{does not appear to}} affect outcomes. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria for each type of <b>birth</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in developing countries are not using a modern <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> method. <b>Birth</b> <b>control</b> use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to <b>birth</b> <b>control.</b> <b>Birth</b> <b>control</b> increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E

5|$|<b>Birth</b> <b>control</b> {{practices}} were generally adopted earlier in Europe {{than in the}} United States. Knowlton's book was reprinted in 1877 in England by Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant, {{with the goal of}} challenging Britain's obscenity laws. They were arrested (and later acquitted) but the publicity of their trial contributed to the formation, in 1877, of the Malthusian League– the world's first <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> advocacy group– which sought to limit population growth to avoid Thomas Malthus's dire predictions of exponential population growth leading to worldwide poverty and famine. By 1930, similar societies had been established in nearly all European countries, and <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> began to find acceptance in most Western European countries, except Catholic Ireland, Spain, and France. As the <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> societies spread across Europe, so did <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> clinics. The first <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> clinic in the world was established in the Netherlands in 1882, run by the Netherlands' first female physician, Aletta Jacobs. The first <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> clinic in England was established in 1921 by Marie Stopes, in London.|$|E
5|$|In teenagers, pregnancies are {{at greater}} risk of poor outcomes. Comprehensive sex {{education}} and access to <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms of <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> can generally be used by young people, long-acting reversible <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy. After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks. Some methods of <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months. In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> pills. In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> be continued for one year after the last period.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} methods of <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> are sterilization {{by means of}} vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and implantable <b>birth</b> <b>control.</b> This {{is followed by a}} number of hormone-based methods including oral pills, patches, vaginal rings, and injections. Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms, diaphragms and <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> sponges and fertility awareness methods. The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation. Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all other methods are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them. Safe sex practices, such as with the use of male or female condoms, can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections. Other methods of <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Emergency <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex. Some argue not having sex as a form of <b>birth</b> <b>control,</b> but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> education, due to non-compliance.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that trisomy risk is increased for women with fewer oocytes (older ovar-ian age) than other women of the same chronological age. METHODS: Our study compared three indicators of ovarian ageÐnumber of antral follicles, level of dimeric inhibin B, level of FSHÐamong women who had trisomic pregnancy losses (n = 54) with those among women who had other losses (24 with other chromosomally abnormal loses, 21 with chromosomally normal losses) or who had chromosomally normal births (n = 65). RESULTS: Ovarian age indicators did not differ between women with trisomic spontaneous abortions and the three comparison groups. Compared with live <b>birth</b> <b>controls,</b> adjusting for chronological age, we estimate that, on average, among trisomy cases the geometric means of 1 + follicle count, inhibin B and FSH are about 7. 5 % higher, 16. 6 % higher and 5. 5 % lower, respectively, with all 95 % con®dence intervals including zero.

40|$|To address {{concerns}} regarding the representativeness of controls in case-control studies, two selection strategies were evaluated {{in a study}} of childhood leukemia, which commenced in California in 1995. The authors selected two controls per case: one from among children identified by using computerized birth records and located successfully, the other from a roster of friends; both were matched on demographic factors. Sixty-four <b>birth</b> certificate–friend <b>control</b> pairs were enrolled (n = 128). Additionally, 192 “ideal ” controls were selected without tracing from the birth records. Data on parental ages, parental education, mother’s reproductive history, and birth weight were obtained from the birth certificates of all 320 subjects. For all variables except birth weight, the differences between birth certificate and ideal controls were smaller than those between friend and ideal controls. None of the differences between birth certificate and ideal controls was significant, whereas two factors were significantly different between friend and ideal controls. These findings suggest that friend controls may be less representative than <b>birth</b> certificate <b>controls.</b> Despite difficulty in tracing and a seemingly low participation rate (49. 0 % for 560 enrolled <b>birth</b> certificate <b>controls),</b> using <b>birth</b> records to recruit controls appears to provide a representative sample of children and an opportunity to assess the representativeness of controls. case-control studies; child; epidemiologic methods; leukemi...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study in}} a {{large-scale}} cohort with prospective data the associations of psychosocial adversities during pregnancy with length of gestation and offspring size at birth. METHODS: We defined a priori {{two types of}} psychosocial adversity during pregnancy: life stress (perceived burdens in major areas of life) and emotional symptoms (e. g. anxiety). Measures of offspring size at birth, including body weight, body length, abdominal and head circumference, were obtained from a national medical birth registry. We included in the analyses gestational age and offspring size at <b>birth</b> <b>controlled</b> for length of gestation; the latter was calculated by gestational-age-specific z scores (ZS) reported in 10 (- 3). We conducted multiple regression analyses adjusted for potential confounders to estimate the association between exposures and birth outcomes (n = 78017 pregnancies). RESULTS: Life stress (per score increase by 1; range, 0 - 18) was associated with shorter length of gestation (days; B, - 0. 14; 95 % confidence interval (CI), - 0. 19, - 0. 10), increased offspring body weight (ZS; B, 9. 14; 95 % CI, 4. 99, 13. 28), body length (ZS; B, 6. 58; 95 % CI, 2. 39, 10. 77), abdominal circumference (ZS; B, 9. 96; 95 % CI, 5. 77, 14. 16), and head circumference (ZS; B, 6. 13; 95 % CI, 1. 95, 10. 30). Emotional symptoms were associated with shorter length of gestation (days; B, - 0. 04; 95 % CI, - 0. 07, - 0. 004) and decreased body length (ZS; B, - 4. 44; 95 % CI, - 7. 57, - 1. 32) only.
