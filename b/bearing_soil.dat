Subsoil reponse behaviour and dissipated energy components are investigated for different grouser shapes, spacings, displacements, and flexibility boundary conditions.

It is shown {{that the presence of}} a structure on top of an outcropping fault may have a significant influence on the rupture path: with heavy structures founded on continuous and rigid foundations, the fault rupture diverts substantially and may avoid rupturing underneath the structure. The latter undergoes rigid body rotation, with its foundation sometimes loosing contact with the <b>bearing</b> <b>soil,</b> but in most cases retaining its structural integrity. In stark contrast, buildings on isolated footings and, perhaps surprisingly, piles exert a smaller diversion of the rupture which is thus likely to outcrop between the footings or pile caps; the latter may thus undergo devastating differential displacements.

Both copper and silver coins demonstrated a distinct layering with a metal core followed by an initial oxide layer and an external layer <b>bearing</b> <b>soil</b> markers and secondary corrosion products where present. X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence and SEM-EDS were employed to characterise the corrosion products and determine the basic elemental composition of the corrosion layers.

40|$|The use {{of shells}} in {{foundation}} structures over traditional forms has grown steadily since their inception {{in the early}} nineteen–fifties. Shell foundations outperform conventional flat footings and are reputable performers especially when heavy superstructural loads are to be transmitted to weak <b>bearing</b> <b>soil.</b> The geotechnical performance of shells in an elastic continuum concerns their bearing capacities and settlement behaviour, whose study has been trailing behind that of their structural performance. Bringing contact pressures closer to uniformity at the soil–shell structure interface is essential in developing a viable behavioural response under vertically concentric and monotonic loading conditions. This study encapsulates {{the development of new}} shell foundation geometries employing shell inversion under such loading conditions. Experimental investigation involves validation of the numerical phase in a comparative study following a two–dimensional analysis of shell models using commercially available geotechnical software with finite element analysis. New inverted triangular footings embedded in sand composed of ultra–high performance iShell Mix concrete using fiber–reinforced polymeric (FRP) microfibers are analyzed. A parametric analysis examines key sensitivity elements including shell angle and shell thickness in granular soil for both upright shells and their inverted counterpart. Linearly–elastic behaviour of concrete material is assumed while soil media is modeled under nonlinear elastic perfectly–plastic conditions following the Mohr–Coulomb yield criterion for loose, medium and dense sand states. Theoretical modeling was developed to generate inverted shell bearing capacity factors to predict ultimate bearing capacities of the shell footings. Simulation efforts scrutinized reveal comparable performance with bearing capacity increase of 3 – 5 % for the inverted shells over upright shell models and notable improvements of 42 – 45 % over conventional flat footings. The developed models investigated represent forefront configurations of superior performance signifying that shells in foundations be highly regarded and fully exploited whenever feasible...|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{remediation}} involves heating subsurface {{environments and}} collecting fluids {{in order to}} recover contaminants such as tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE). While increasing subsurface temperature can lead {{to changes in the}} distribution of contaminants between the solid, liquid, and gas phases, there is also an increased potential for PCE and TCE to degrade. This work was performed to determine the rate of PCE and TCE degradation and products formed in laboratory-scale experiments designed to simulate thermal remediation conditions. The conditions during transport of gas-phase TCE were simulated using flow-through experiments in the temperature range from 60 to 800 C. Degradation of TCE was not evident at temperatures of less than 240 C; however, chloroacetic acids, which comprised less than 0. 1 % of the influent TCE on a carbon basis, were detected. At temperatures greater than 300 C, TCE readily degraded where the identities of the degradation products were a function of oxygen and water content. With oxygen present, TCE degraded to form CO, phosgene, CO 2 with minor amounts of hexachloroethane, PCE, and carbon tetrachloride. Increasing the amount of water vapor was found to decrease the amount of TCE degraded. Vapor recovery systems used during thermal treatments are anticipated to capture these TCE degradation products. However, the amount of missing carbon (~ 17 %) in experiments completed at 800 C makes the prospect of recovering all TCE degradation products doubtful. Experiments were conducted using hermetically sealed ampules to simulate heating dissolved phase PCE and TCE over periods of up to 75 days. At 120 C, the first-order TCE degradation half-life was 330 days and the degradation products included CO and CO 2, glycolate, formate, and chloride. The rate of TCE disappearance was increased with the addition of 1 % (wt.) goethite, which suggests that the presence of iron <b>bearing</b> <b>soil</b> minerals can increase rates of TCE degradation during thermal treatment. In contaminated field samples, TCE was found to degrade to form cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethylene at 95 C coincident with the formation of hydrogen gas.

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} by which any engineering structure resists load is an essential requirement for its consistent and reliable design. The axial resistance which can be mobilised by piled foundations in liquefiable soils when subjected to strong shaking remains highly uncertain, {{and a number of}} piled foundations have failed in strong earthquakes as recently as 2011. The lack of visible foundation distress in many such cases indicates that failure can occur {{as a result of the}} loss of axial capacity during an earthquake, as opposed to the laterally-dominated failure modes which have been the focus of the research community for the last 20 to 30 years. In this thesis, a series of dynamic centrifuge experiments have been carried out to establish how the distribution of axial loads along the length of a pile changes during a strong earthquake. In each test, a 2 × 2 pile group was installed such that its tips were embedded in a dense sand layer which was overlain by liquefiable soil. The tests examine the effects arising from the hydraulic conductivity in the bearing layer, the influence of axial pile cap support and finally whether there are any differences in the behaviour of nominally jacked or bored piles under seismic loading. The pile cap has been shown to play a substantial role in supporting axial loads during strong shaking. In cases where the pile cap was unable to support axial load, the majority of the axial loading was carried as pile end bearing, with some shaft friction being mobilised in both the liquefiable and <b>bearing</b> <b>soil</b> layers as a result of relative lateral displacements between the soil and pile. However, where the pile cap is able to support axial loads, the settlement of the pile cap into the soil led to a dramatic transfer of axial load away from the piles and onto the pile cap. These results imply that where substantial excess pore pressures may be generated at the depth of the pile tip, then the pile caps must be able to support significant axial load. The increased effective stresses below the pile cap were responsible for the mobilisation of shaft friction on the section of pile within the liquefiable layer. However, these piles were unable to mobilise shaft friction in the bearing layer due to the reduced lateral loading on the piles. The axial behaviour of the piled foundations after the end of strong shaking is affected by the recovery of pile end bearing capacity and is therefore strongly dependent on the hydraulic conductivity of the bearing layer. The axial behaviour of nominally bored and jacked pile groups in liquefiable soil deposits are very different under seismic excitation, with the installation process of the latter substantially altering the soil conditions around the tips of the pile, such that in contrast to the bored pile groups, the jacked pile groups did not accumulate settlements until significantly after the strong shaking had commenced. These results imply that the method of installation is an important factor in the seismic response of a foundation, and may be more pronounced for real earthquakes where the number of strong shaking cycles may be more limited than those simulated in the experiments.

40|$|Executive Summary Dynamically loaded {{wind turbine}} {{generator}} (WTG) foundation design requires a specialized design process due to abnormal loading conditions over a large bearing area. Multiple foundation options exist to support WTGs. A large octagonal mass of reinforced concrete is {{the most commonly used}} foundation type. Two high-capacity (? 1. 5 MW) WTGs were instrumented in the upper Midwest of the US. The instrumentation was oriented {{to take advantage of the}} predominant wind direction in each site. This thesis focuses on the interpretation and analysis of data from these two instrumented WTG foundations. Ten soil deformation gauges were installed at each site. The main purpose of the soil strain gauges (SG) was to measure the deformation of the underlying <b>bearing</b> <b>soil</b> at different locations and depths. Pressure gauges (PG) were installed to monitor the dynamic pressure distribution underlying the octagonal WTG foundations. At one of the sites (Site A), thermal dissipation sensors and micro-electro-mechanical system accelerometers (MEMS) were installed to monitor volumetric water content change and foundation block rotation, respectively. Turbine towers were also instrumented with strain gauges to estimate moment transfer from the tower to the foundation. Improvement of design approaches for dynamically loaded foundations, such as WTG foundations, requires knowledge of stress-strain transfer mechanisms. Data analysis from field- instrumented WTG foundation systems can be used to validate present-day design assumptions and to provide new and mechanically accurate approaches. Observations of contact pressure distribution, foundation soil deformation, and transferred moment from tower to foundation assist in understanding the mechanistic and dynamic behavior of WTG foundations and soil bearing response. Based on this research effort, changes in soil pressure and strain were highly related to wind direction and speed. At normal operating conditions, the most variation in pressure distribution was observed towards the edge of the foundation. Normalized pressure amplitude was around 0. 35 (pressure/pressure average of analyzed data set) for the pressure cells locate at the edge of the foundation. Interior pressure cells (e. g., PG- 2, PG- 3, and PG- 4), on the other hand, exhibited lower amplitudes (? 0. 10). This indicates that the outer portion of the foundation is more susceptible to stress changes. Although pressure was distributed across entire the foundation footprint, pressure response was not uniform. Pressure shifts were observed in the cases of startup and shutdown conditions. During the shutdown sequences, greater pressure fluctuations were observed (e. g., 17 % in PG- 3, 48 % in PG- 4). Pressure data analysis indicated that maximum and minimum pressures occur during turbine shutdown. Pressure spikes were observed during shutdown varying from 2 kPa to 10 kPa depending on the location of the pressure cell. Pressure cell - soil stiffness interaction is required for analysis of this type of field data. Under-representation was observed due to pressure drop in pressure cells. These decreases which under-represents the calculated static dead load of 78 kPa are attributed cell-soil stiffness difference and ?bridging? phenomenon. Soil strain was also non-uniform in distribution, both horizontally and vertically. The highest elastic soil deformation (0. 02 mm over the gage length of 300 mm) occurred at the leeward site of the predominant wind direction. Moreover, soil deformation decreased systematically with depth. Strain level at full power production was computed as 0. 006 % immediately beneath the foundation and approximately 80 % of this strain dissipates within 1. 7 m. A commonly assumed cyclic strain level of 0. 1 % for design purposes (Det Norske Veritas) may significantly over-estimate strain levels experienced in the field for sites with stiff clay, such as these two instrumented sites in the mid-west. The observed displacement and pressure trends were symmetric depth dependent and highly correlated to wind direction and speed and location. Thermal dissipation sensors indicated that gravimetric water content does not significantly change over time as the foundation soil is shield from most environmental changes by the concrete block. The observed changes are most likely related to large seasonal changes (23 % � 2 %). According to the MEMS accelerometer analysis, tilts were computed as 0. 38 o at S 30 E, 0. 16 o at 90 W, and 0. 18 o at N 30 E. These tilts create approximately 0. 5 m sway (in amplitude) at the top of the WTG...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In shield {{tunnelling}} {{in loose}} and water <b>bearing</b> <b>soils,</b> a bentonite slurry {{is often used}} to help support the tunnel face. During excavation, the bentonite cake, which is intended to seal the face, is removed by the cutter bits and subsequently slurry will infiltrate the soil. This infiltration causes excess pore pressures in front of the TBM, which lower the stability of the face. The effect has been investigated using a stationary model as well as with a time-dependent groundwater flow model, linked to a limit equilibrium face stability model. This model can be used to predict the minimal required support pressure and also the build-up of excess pore pressures in front of the TBM over time. The calculated excess pore pressures compare well with field observations. ...|$|R
