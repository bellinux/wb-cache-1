In 1978 a St Albans linen merchant, Denis Pamphilon, was fined £100 daily for usurpation of the banner on decorative <b>bedspreads</b> until he desisted, and both Rangers F.C. and the Scottish National Party have been admonished by the Court of the Lord Lyon for their improper and non-authorised use of the banner. Despite such action, the flag continues to feature {{on a variety of}} merchandise and souvenirs produced commercially for Scotland's economically important tourism industry.|$|E

In {{the dining room and}} kitchen, the furniture are in bright red and yellow colors, and logs stacked against each other fill up a wall. The walkway to the Head of Household room evokes a giant library. The Head of Household room is an exotic island oasis. The headboard is made from a surfboard, there are Hula girl table lamps, rattan carpet and Polynesian knickknacks. The boat bedroom features shelves and chests designed to resemble small rowboats with rowboat shaped beds. Two large beds made of actual unfinished tree branches with pink <b>bedspreads</b> fill another room. The living room features a giant green semi-circular sofa, and a stone wall fireplace. A red colored room connected directly to the living room by a short hallway, with no doors, has a pair of pullout couches rather than actual beds. New this season is a Spa room complete with a massage table, two-person sauna and lounge. The spa room would be featured in numerous subsequent seasons. Outside, there is a hot tub and pool, a billiards table and lounge area. The lounge area features a fire pit and heated lamps. Along with work-out equipment, there are lawn chairs to lay out in the sun. The outside also includes the washing machine and clothes dryer, both of which are covered overhead.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the pilot}} was shot in Los Angeles, {{principal}} filming {{for the rest of}} the season took place in Vancouver, British Columbia. Local sites often served as shooting locations, with much of [...] "Dead in the Water" [...] taking place at Buntzen Lake and the climax of [...] "Wendigo" [...] occurring in a Britannia Beach mine. Likewise, Riverview Hospital functioned as a mental institution in [...] "Asylum". Though production has sometimes recycled sets from other television series—"The Benders" [...] made use of a previously-built Western town, while the warehouse-loft set of [...] "Shadow" [...] originated from the series Tru Calling—most episodes usually require the construction of new sets due to the constant change of setting. The production team, however, created reusable standing sets in the form of the motel rooms frequented by the Winchesters. Each episode presents a different theme to disguise the motel-room set's repeated use, with different colors, <b>bedspreads,</b> and curtains being used. The episode [...] "Provenance", for instance, displayed a disco-themed motel room.|$|E
500|$|Located in {{the holy}} [...] "Valley of the Saints", the International Academy of Meditation, also called the Chaurasi Kutia ashram, was a [...] compound. It stood across the River Ganges from Rishikesh, the [...] "yoga capital of the world" [...] and home to many ashrams {{in the foothills of}} the Himalayas, [...] above the river and {{surrounded}} by jungle. The Maharishi's facility was built in 1963 with a $100,000 gift from American heiress Doris Duke, on land leased from the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department. [...] The training centre was designed to suit Western habits and was described variously as [...] "luxurious" [...] and [...] "seedy". Starr later compared the ashram to [...] "a kind of spiritual Butlins" [...] (a low-cost British holiday camp). It was built to accommodate several dozen people and each of its stone bungalows contained five rooms. Each was equipped with electric heaters, running water, toilets, and English-style furniture. According to DeHerrera, the Maharishi obtained many [...] "special items" [...] from a nearby village so that the Beatles rooms would have mirrors, wall-to-wall carpeting, wall coverings, [...] "foam mattresses" [...] and <b>bedspreads.</b> She wrote that [...] "by the standard of the other" [...] bungalows, the Beatles' cottages [...] "looked like a palace".|$|E

2500|$|He {{attended}} {{school in a}} one-room schoolhouse nine miles away in Ringgold, Georgia. In 1928, Rollins’s father fell ill and the 12-year-old boy accepted additional responsibilities on the family farm. Although he worked hard to help his mother provide for the family he had an entrepreneurial spirit and tried his hand {{at an early age}} selling door to door with things such as <b>bedspreads.</b> [...] In the aftermath of the great depression, he left the family farm in Ringgold and moved to Philadelphia. [...] His career was a series of entrepreurial ventures ultimately ending up with the formation of 9 NYSE firms and countless other business ventures. [...] He had a great mind for business and an unstoppable positive attitude.|$|E
2500|$|In Michoacán, women weave on {{back strap}} looms {{as they did}} in the pre-Hispanic period with most weaving on pedal looms done by men. Sheep are {{generally}} shorn twice a year, spring and fall, with the wool obtained in each season requiring different handling because of the types of impurities found. Most wool is white but brown and black is found as well. Wool textile products include sarapes, wrap belts, rebozos, rugs and blankets. Cotton is spun and woven mostly to create clothing and linens—including dresses, shirts, blouses, jackets, tablecloths, table runners, napkins, and <b>bedspreads.</b> The most representative work in cotton comes from Patzcuaro and Uruapan, as well as Zacán and Tócuaro. [...] Other notable cotton work is that of the Nahuas in the coastal areas. These textiles tend to be the most traditional, as they are made for self-consumption, with the pieces created from the growing of the cotton to weaving the cloth to sewing and embroidering the garment. The two towns best known for this work are Cachán and Maruata.|$|E
2500|$|Godfrey's mother, Kathryn, was {{a gifted}} artist and {{composer}} whose aspirations to fame were laid aside {{to take care}} of her family after her husband, Arthur or [...] "Darl'", died. [...] Her creativity enabled the family to get through some very hard times by playing the piano to accompany silent movies, making jams and jellies and crocheting <b>bedspreads</b> to sell, and even cutting off and selling her floor length hair, as it was extremely difficult for a woman of her [...] "class" [...] to find work without violating social mores of the time. [...] The one household item that was never sold or turned into firewood was the piano, and she believed at least some of her children would succeed in show business. [...] In her later years some of her compositions were performed by symphony orchestras in Canada, which earned her a mention in Time. In 1957, at the age of 78, her sauciness made her a big hit with the audience when she appeared on Groucho Marx's quiz show You Bet Your Life. [...] She died of cancer in 1968 at a nursing home in a suburb north of Chicago.|$|E

60|$|But now she {{followed}} Ilona into the best bedroom, the sanctum sanctorum of every Hungarian peasant home--the room that bears most distinctly the impress of the housewifely character that presides over it. And as Elsa stood upon {{the threshold of}} her future sister-in-law's precious domain, she forgot her momentary sadness {{in the hope of}} a brighter future, when she, too, would make her new home orderly and sweet-scented, with beautifully-polished furniture and floors radiant with cleanliness. The thought of what her own best bedroom would be like delighted her fancy. It was a lovely room, for Béla's house was larger by far than his sister's, the rooms were wider and more lofty, and the windows had large, clear panes of glass in them. She would have two beautiful bedsteads in the room, and the <b>bedspreads</b> would be piled up to the ceiling with down pillows and duvets covered in scarlet twill; she would have two beautiful spreads of crochet-work, a washstand with marble top, and white crockery, and there would be a stencilling of rose garlands on the colour-washed walls.|$|E
60|$|It {{was rough}} and simple, and not unlike what baby bears {{would have made}} of an {{underground}} house in the same circumstances. But there was one recess in the wall, {{no larger than a}} bird-cage, which was the private apartment of Tinker Bell. It could be shut {{off from the rest of}} the home by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious, always kept drawn when dressing or undressing. No woman, however large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir and bedchamber combined. The couch, as she always called it, was a genuine Queen Mab, with club legs; and she varied the <b>bedspreads</b> according to what fruit-blossom was in season. Her mirror was a Puss-in-boots, of which there are now only three, unchipped, known to the fairy dealers; the wash-stand was Pie-crust and reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth, and the carpet and rugs of the best (the early) period of Margery and Robin. There was a chandelier from Tiddly winks for the look of the thing, but of course she lit the residence herself. Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house, as indeed was perhaps inevitable; and her chamber, though beautiful, looked rather conceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up.|$|E
6000|$|The primary point I {{meant to}} emphasise {{is that this}} sort of {{aristocracy}} is essentially a new sort. All the old despots were demagogues; at least, they were demagogues whenever they were really trying to please or impress the demos. If they poured out beer for their vassals it was because both they and their vassals had a taste for beer. If (in some slightly different mood) they poured melted lead on their vassals, it was because both they and their vassals had a strong distaste for melted lead. But they did not make any mystery about either of the two substances. They did not say, [...] "You don't like melted lead?.... Ah! no, of course, you wouldn't; you are probably {{the kind of person who}} would prefer beer.... It is no good asking you even to imagine the curious undercurrent of psychological pleasure felt by a refined person under the seeming shock of melted lead." [...] Even tyrants when they tried to be popular, tried to give the people pleasure; they did not try to overawe the people by giving them something which they ought to regard as pleasure. It was the same with the popular presentment of aristocracy. Aristocrats tried to impress humanity by the exhibition of qualities which humanity admires, such as courage, gaiety, or even mere splendour. The aristocracy might have more possession in these things, but the democracy had quite equal delight in them. It was much more sensible to offer yourself for admiration because you had drunk three bottles of port at a sitting, than to offer yourself for admiration (as Lady Grove does) because you think it right to say [...] "port wine" [...] while other people think it right to say [...] "port." [...] Whether Lady Grove's preference for port wine (I mean for the phrase port wine) is a piece of mere nonsense I do not know; but at least it is a very good example of the futility of such tests in the matter even of mere breeding. [...] "Port wine" [...] may happen to be the phrase used n certain good families; but numberless aristocrats say [...] "port," [...] and all barmaids say [...] "port wine." [...] The whole thing is rather more trivial than collecting tram-tickets; and I will not pursue Lady Grove's further distinctions. I pass over the interesting theory that I ought to say to Jones (even apparently if he is my dearest friend), [...] "How is Mrs. Jones?" [...] instead of [...] "How is your wife?" [...] and I pass over an impassioned declamation about <b>bedspreads</b> (I think) which has failed to fire my blood.|$|E
