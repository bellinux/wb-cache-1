500|$|Stevens is {{a proponent}} of using {{statistical}} analysis to enhance his coaching decisions, spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film. [...] "I think it's a unique {{way of looking at}} the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players", he explains. For example, when Butler was slumping in late 2010, Stevens challenged his team: [...] "this [...] is where we are. This isn't acceptable to get to where we want to go. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> that really mean? It's not just get better defensively, it is, if we give up 3 less baskets a game, then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country". The team got the message, improved throughout the season, and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense. In 2012, Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff. If he had the resources, Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play.|$|E

How, for whom, are these ballot papers going to be used, and how will it be ensured that they will not fall into the wrong hands?"

2500|$|Judith George {{explains}} that [...] "Analysis of the [...] poems in their context {{holds up a}} mirror to the ways {{and values of the}} times". Very little work of the poets of Vandal North Africa survives, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> is found in the Latin Anthology; apart from their names, {{little is known about the}} poets themselves, not even when they were writing. Their work drew on earlier Roman traditions. Modern scholars generally hold the view that the Vandals allowed the Romans in North Africa to carry on with their way of life with only occasional interference.|$|E
2500|$|As {{various other}} critics do, Michael Coveney is still asking: [...] "Yes, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> it all mean? Kenneth Tynan railed against the 'gratuitous obscurity' of Harold Pinter's poetic 1975 play {{when it was}} first {{produced}} by Peter Hall at the National starring John Gielgud as the supplicant versifier Spooner and Ralph Richardson as his host Hirst, patron and supporter of the arts. But the play is always gloriously enjoyable as an off-kilter vaudeville of friendship and dependency." [...] In The Guardian, Billington concludes that [...] "This is a compelling revival much aided by Neil Austin's lighting and Adam Cork's subliminal sound," [...] observing: [...] "when audience and cast finally joined in applauding Pinter, [...] seated in a box, I felt it was in recognition of an eerily disturbing play that transports us into a world somewhere between reality and dream." ...|$|E

2500|$|Subjectivity is {{that which}} the individual—and no one else—has. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> it mean to have {{something}} like this? It cannot be understood {{in the same way}} as having a car or a bank account. It means to be someone who is becoming someone—it means being a person with a past, a present, and a future. No one can have an individual's past, present or future. Different people experience these in various ways—these experiences are unique, not anyone else's. Having a past, present, and future means that a person is an existing individual—that a person can find meaning in time and by existing. Individuals do not think themselves into existence, they are born. But once born and past a certain age, the individual begins to make choices in life; now those choices can be his, his parents', society’s, etc. The important point is that to exist, the individual must make choices—the individual must decide what to do the next moment and on into the future. What the individual chooses and how he chooses will define who and what he is—to himself and to others. Kierkegaard put it this way in Works of Love, 1847: ...|$|E
2500|$|Suppose M and N are two {{differentiable}} manifolds with dimensions m and n, respectively, and f is {{a function}} from M to N. Since differentiable manifolds are topological spaces {{we know what it}} means for f to be continuous. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> [...] "f is [...] " [...] mean for ?
