Additionally, the relatively pale species of the central and southern Espinhaço Mountains has been called the mouse-coloured tapaculo (used briefly by Comitê Brasileiro de Registros Ornitológicos, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>anymore),</b> which could add additional confusion. The name Serra do Mar tapaculo for the species of the Serra do Mar region is also potentially misleading, as it is not entirely restricted to this mountain range, but also occurs far inland in Paraná and Santa Catarina.|$|E
