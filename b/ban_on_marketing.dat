40|$|This Essay {{develops}} {{an alternative}} theory of market-inalienability and applies {{it in an}} analysis of the consequences of the <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>markets</b> in organs. Unlike the conventional view-that the ban is responsible for critical shortages-this theory rests on two ideas: (1) When a market in a good is banned, those who assume the task of procurement will turn to alternative means-exhortation-to induce supply; and (2) Legislation that renders a particular good market-inalienable effectively converts the good into common property, which can be analyzed using the well-developed economic theory concerning the allocation of resources owned in common. Theoretically, a <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> a <b>market</b> in a good that costs less to obtain by exhortation than to purchase might yield a larger supply than a market would. The findings imply that it may be the obstacles to adequate exhortation, rather than the inefficiency of appeals to donor altruism, that are responsible for shortages. While this does not suggest that a <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>markets</b> is efficient, it does demonstrate that the ban need not cause a shortage of some limited set of goods and services, which may include organs. Indeed, rather counter-intuitively, a ban could-however inefficiently-enlarge supply...|$|R
40|$|Using {{data from}} {{fourteen}} equity markets, this study empirically examines {{the impact of}} the 2008 short-selling <b>bans</b> <b>on</b> <b>market</b> quality. Evidence indicates that restrictions on short-selling lead to artificially inflated prices, indicated by positive abnormal returns. This is consistent with Miller's (1977) overvaluation theory, and suggests that the bans are effective in temporarily stabilizing prices in struggling financial stocks. Market quality is reduced during the restrictions, as evidenced by wider bid-ask spreads, increased price volatility and reduced trading activity. While these effects are strong, regulators may view the deterioration in market quality as a necessary by-product of the bans to maintain prices and protect investors. 12 page(s...|$|R

Since 2011, Argentina has had a complete <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>marketing</b> and sale of e-cigarettes. However, e-cigarettes are marketed online and can be easily bought in stores. We conducted a longitudinal study to evaluate the determinants of e-cigarette trial among Argentinean early adolescents. Methods A school-based longitudinal study was conducted in 2014 - 15, in 3 large cities in Argentina. Among students who reported never smoking an e-cigarette at baseline, we assessed demographics, media use, sensation seeking, smoking behavior, network member smoking, use of other substances, and perception of e-cigarette risk as potential risk factors for e-cigarette trial at follow up (mean between-wave interval 17. 1 months) using multilevel logistic regression models with random intercepts for schools. Results E-cigarette trial prevalence increased from baseline (1. 8 %; n= 57) to follow up (7. 1 %; n= 139). Independent predictors of e-cigarette use at follow up included: higher sensation seeking (OR: 1. 49 95 % CI 1. 21 - 1. 84); being a current smoker (OR: 2. 58 95 % CI 1. 38 - 4. 83); having close friends that smoke cigarettes (OR: 1. 93 95 % CI 1. 25 - 2. 99) and being highly exposed to tobacco product ads online (OR: 1. 87 95 % CI 1. 04 - 3. 36). Attending a public school was the only protective factor (OR: 0. 40 95 % CI 0. 22 - 0. 73). Conclusions In Argentina, illicit trial of e-cigarettes among early adolescents is low but appears to be rapidly increasing.

40|$|I {{assess the}} effects of the 2008 short sale <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>market</b> quality, order choice, and limit order {{execution}} times for a matched sample of restricted and unrestricted securities in an eq-uity limit order book. I find that liquidity, volatility, and market efficiency for restricted stocks relative to control stocks are adversely affected during the ban. Markets take almost twice as much time to process the predictable information in order imbalances for restricted securities. Order choice changes are consistent with decreased sell-side liquidity provision and more ag-gressive buy-side liquidity supply. Limit orders, especially those on the sell side of the market, become more valuable to traders demanding immediacy. Adjusting for attributes of the order book, limit order execution times decrease by 30 % for buy orders and 40 % for sell orders for restricted firms during the ban. ∗I am grateful to my advisor, Robert Korajczyk, for discussions which substantially improved this paper.

However, since the mid 1990 s, scholars have proposed that {{social marketing}} should broaden its scope beyond individuals, or groups of consumers, and attempt to influence those that help shape the determinants of human behaviour such as policy makers, regulators, managers, educators and the media (Goldberg, 1995; Andreasen, 2006). The premise is that marketing concepts and techniques, alongside other tools, {{can be used to}} influence the behaviours of decision makers and opinion formers for example to induce policy change.

40|$|Dyes are commercially {{indispensable}} and {{the expanding}} industry offers a complete palette of colors. Azo dyes constitute the largest chemical class of synthetic dyes {{because of their}} versatility, low price, and ease of production. These dyes may, however, pose health risk to humans due to formation of mutagenic/carcinogenic aromatic amines upon reductive cleavage of their azo groups (-N=N-). Therefore, the EU has introduced a <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> the <b>marketing</b> and use of certain azo dyes in textile and leather goods.

Although capital flow fluctuations were largely due to global risk-on risk-off factors, a widening current account deficit (CAD) contributed to India's vulnerability to external shocks. The major source of shocks was external, but policy mistakes increased India's vulnerability. These included inadequate attention to sectoral bottlenecks that reduced export growth and domestic financial savings, while substitution away from expensive oil imports was discouraged. Dependence on foreign capital, to finance the CAD, rose while degrees of freedom from continuing capital controls were underutilized to reduce exchange rate volatility and to smooth interest rates. Steep depreciations combined with volatility did not help exporters. Evaluation of measures to stabilize the exchange rate establishes that temporarily taking oil marketing companies demand {{out of the market}} was the most effective, since small demand-supply mismatches lead to large currency movements in thin markets. Prudential measures such as increasing position limits, margin requirements are to be preferred to a <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> a <b>market</b> or a transaction-type.

40|$|In the U. S. and Europe, a <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> a <b>market</b> {{in human}} organs {{has been in}} place since 1984. The system of organ procurement, therefore, relies on altruistic {{donation}} from stranger to stranger. The principle intellectual and policy issues surrounding organ procurement concern the question of whether, in banning the market to further ethical objectives, efficiency must inevitably be sacrificed. In the 1970 s, Titmuss questioned whether a market could supply high quality blood in sufficient quantity, and this issue attracted the attention of some of the best minds in economics, such as Arrow and Solow. Since then, a large-scale industry relying on human tissue as a basic resource has emerged. In 2000, nearly 50 [thin space] 000 organs were transplanted. Remarkably, all of them were procured without providing financial incentives to suppliers. Despite the large number of donations, many more are needed. Today, more than 95 [thin space] 000 people are waiting for kidneys alone, and it is estimated that, in 2001, over 6000 Americans died waiting for an organ. Many believe that a market in organs would yield a greater supply and they hold the policy of banning an organ market responsible for the current tragic shortages. This chapter reviews the economic theory and evidence regarding market bans and considers them in the context of organ procurement. ...|$|R

Key words: edible offals, European Community, quality restrictions, trade, welfare. Traditional barriers to trade implemented by importing countries include tariffs, import quotas, and voluntary export restraints. The different consequences and welfare effects of these forms of protection have been docu-mented in the literature (see, for example, Al-len, Dodge, and Schmitz; Kreinin; Blyth; Caves and Jones). All three have the effect of raising prices in the importing country but differ in the way in which the revenue from the market intervention is distributed. Typically, the rev-enue from a tariff is collected by the govern-ment of the importing country, while the rents generated by an import quota accrue to those who receive licenses to import. In the case of an import quota, the government can capture the rents if the licenses are sold or auctioned. Voluntary export restraints also generate quota rents, but these rents are retained in the ex-porting country through the sale, auction, or grant of the right to export. Another type of trade barrier is the use of qualitative standards to prevent the entry of certain kinds of goods.

Evidence shows that tobacco and alcohol industry marketing influences smoking and drinking initiation and prevalence, and although tobacco marketing is increasingly regulated (including through the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), a legally binding global treaty) controls <b>on</b> alcohol <b>marketing</b> remain more limited. There are three novel strands to this thesis. First, systematic reviews examining how the tobacco and alcohol industries have attempted to influence marketing regulations, {{and the development of}} two new taxonomies for tactic and argument categorisation. Second, a statistical analysis of the tobacco and alcohol marketing environments across a diverse range of countries, including the extent of any geographic or urban/rural differences. And third, an assessment of tobacco and alcohol industry compliance with national marketing regulations. Substantial commonalities between tobacco and alcohol industry activity were identified, suggesting that alcohol policy may benefit from reproducing efforts in tobacco control aimed at excluding industry from policy discussions. Additionally, data analysis showed that there were high levels of tobacco marketing despite FCTC ratification, and that exposure to alcohol marketing was even higher. Tobacco marketing was greatest whereas alcohol marketing was lowest in lower income countries, and both were significantly more common in urban communities. All FCTC-ratified countries had some tobacco marketing bans in place, whereas few countries had any comprehensive <b>bans</b> <b>on</b> alcohol <b>marketing.</b> Compliance was often poor, and exposure to tobacco marketing was commonly higher within countries with a full or partial ban compared to those without, whereas all forms of alcohol marketing were lower in countries with a full ban or some restrictions.

In November 2010, the <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> kosher slaughter of chickens was overturned, but the <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> kosher slaughter of beef was still in effect and kosher beef had to be imported from Australia. In June 2011 the World Jewish Congress adopted a resolution calling on the New Zealand Government to abrogate its <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> kosher slaughter.|$|R
40|$|Owing to the {{improved}} crop yields {{attributable to the}} use of agricultural pesticides, there has been a phenomenal increase in their application in recent decades. The widespread use of highly-toxic chemicals has not, however, been free of societal concern. As a reaction to the potential health and environmental hazards, regulatory agencies have been established to oversee pesticide use. ^ The Evironmental Protection Agency (EPA) periodically reviews the status of specific pesticides where the risks to man and his environment are weighed against the economic consequences of restricting the chemical. A decision is then made to re-register, limit, or ban the pesticide in question. Models useful for measuring the economic impact of pesticide restriction, however, have remained in strictly a conceptual state, or have analysed the banning of all pesticides, or have assessed the impact of a nationwide pesticide <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> a small producing region with the assumption that crop prices would not change. ^ In this study, a market-locality-impact-assessment model is developed with the objective of measuring the economic impacts from a specific pesticide <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> a crop. <b>Market</b> impact from a ban is simulated through shifts in the market supply and measured by the change in producer and consumer surplus. The locality model, built around a linear programming technique, measures the change in crop production, costs, and revenues for a region producing {{only a fraction of the}} total output. The price effect from the shift in the market supply is then used to adjust locality changes in producer revenues and surplus. ^ The impact assessment model is next applied to the pesticide-use pattern in Nebraska. The results for selected and all-inclusive pesticide bans reveal that producers gain while consumers lose. Net social welfare, as the sum of producer plus consumer surplus, falls under all pesticide bans. ...|$|R
