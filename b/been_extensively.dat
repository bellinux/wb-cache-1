5|$|Because of its {{distinctive}} course, the Brabant Revolution had <b>been</b> <b>extensively</b> used in historical comparisons with the French Revolution.

5|$|Many Phellodon {{species are}} {{known from the}} southeastern United States, where they have <b>been</b> <b>extensively</b> researched. According to Baird and colleagues, there are nine {{distinct}} Phellodon species from Great Smoky Mountains and the surrounding southern Appalachian Mountains.

5|$|One {{surprising}} {{prediction of}} the permutation by duplication mechanism is that intermediate permutations can occur. For instance, the duplicated {{version of the}} protein should still be functional, since otherwise evolution would quickly select against such proteins. Likewise, partially duplicated intermediates where only one terminus was truncated should be functional. Such intermediates have <b>been</b> <b>extensively</b> documented in protein families such as DNA methyltransferases.|$|E
5|$|Since the Victorian era the Thames has <b>been</b> <b>extensively</b> embanked, {{and many}} of its London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is {{vulnerable}} to flooding. The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-glacial rebound.|$|E

5|$|The {{actions of}} both commanders have <b>been</b> <b>extensively</b> {{analyzed}} in this action. While Montcalm performed well during the battle, some tactical options escaped his notice, {{and some of}} his actions in preparing the defenses at Carillon are open to question. In contrast, almost everything Abercrombie did has been questioned. It is widely held among historians that he was an incompetent commander.|$|E
5|$|The {{coordination}} chemistry of neptunium(V) has <b>been</b> <b>extensively</b> researched {{due to the}} presence of cation–cation interactions in the solid state, which had been already known for actinyl ions.

The centre is constructed using timber-frame walls insulated with straw bales.|$|E

5|$|By mintages, the {{key dates}} {{in this series}} are the 1948, 1949-S, 1953 and 1955. Franklin half dollars have <b>been</b> <b>extensively</b> melted for their silver, and many dates are rarer than the mintage figures indicate. For example, {{although}} more than nine million 1962 halves were struck for circulation, and an additional three million in proof, the coin was more valuable as bullion than in any condition when silver prices reached record levels in 1979–1980. In 2010, the 1962 half in MS-65 condition sold for about US$145, {{second only to the}} 1953-S in price in that grade.|$|E
