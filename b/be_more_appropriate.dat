5|$|Order of Weavers Formed on 17 July 1947, the Orde van Weefsters Vita Feminea Textura, or the Order of Weavers was the {{creation}} of the wives of Dutch Freemasons. They constructed a ritual system using the tools of weaving in their symbology, which they judged to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> for women than stonemasons tools. There are now 17 lodges spread through the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The couch gag was {{suggested}} by Dan Castellaneta's niece. The film True Lies was {{the inspiration for}} the bus crashing against the bridge. To get the fisherman's Chinese correct, Cohen called his friend. When the Chinese actors came, the actors felt Cantonese would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> for the fisherman than Mandarin, so it was changed. Moe was picked to rescue the children, because the writers thought it was funny.|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley {{submitted}} the play for publication to The Browning Box, edited by Bryan Walter Procter, in 1824; it was rejected. In 1830, she submitted it to Rudolph Ackermann {{for publication in}} his children's magazine Forget-Me-Not; it was again rejected. In 1832, she sent it to Alaric Alexander Watts for consideration in his annual Literary Souvenir, however in her letter she suggested that the drama may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> for the juvenile publications edited by his wife, Priscilla Maden Watts. The drama {{was first published in}} 1922 by literary scholar A. Koszul.|$|E

5000|$|Mafenide is used {{to treat}} severe burns. [...] It {{is used to}}pically as an {{adjunctive}} therapy for second- and third-degree burns. It is bacteriostatic against many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Some sources state that mafenide <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> for non-facial burns, while chloramphenicol/prednisolone or bacitracin <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> for facial burns.|$|R
5|$|The infrageneric {{classification}} of the fungus is unclear, and {{depends on what}} taxonomic characters are deemed most important. According to Takahashi, the mushroom's violet pigment, the inamyloid (not staining when treated with Melzer's reagent) hymenophoral tissue (hymenium-bearing tissue), and the smooth hyphae of the outer layer of stem suggest a placement in the section Adonideae (Fr.) Quel., {{as defined by the}} Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus. However, if greater taxonomic emphasis is placed on the weakly amyloid basidiospores, it would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> in the section Fragilipedes (Fr.) Quél.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is indicated}} as an adjunctive (additional) treatment {{in children with}} drug-resistant epilepsy. It is approved by national clinical guidelines in Scotland, England and Wales and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies. Children with a focal lesion (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for surgery {{are more likely to}} become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence advises that the diet should not be recommended for adults with epilepsy. About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants—the low glycaemic index treatment and the modified Atkins diet—to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> for adolescents and adults. A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are tube-fed.|$|E
5|$|Xerocomellus zelleri {{was first}} {{described}} by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912, based on specimens he {{found on the}} campus of the University of Washington. Murrill named it Ceriomyces zelleri before switching the genus later that year to Boletus. In 1944, Walter Henry Snell thought the taxon would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> in the genus Xerocomus. In 1959, mycologists Rolf Singer, Snell and Esther A. Dick transferred the species to Boletellus, explaining that the microstructure of the trama and the faint ornamentation of the spores were inconsistent with placement in Xerocomus. American mycologist Harry D. Thiers, in his 1976 monograph on North American boletes, claimed that he failed to consistently find ornamentation on the spores of material he collected, and preferred to retain the species in Boletus. In 2011, it was moved to the genus Xerocomellus.|$|E

5000|$|The item {{selection}} algorithm utilized {{depends on}} the termination criterion. Maximizing information at the cutscore <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> for the SPRT because it maximizes {{the difference in the}} probabilities used in the likelihood ratio. [...] Maximizing information at the ability estimate <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> for the confidence interval approach because it minimizes the conditional standard error of measurement, which decreases the width of the confidence interval needed to make a classification.|$|R
5|$|She was a costumed crime-fighter like Batman, yet in {{many ways}} not an exact counterpart. For example, the {{contents}} of her utility purse were actually weapons disguised as stereotypical feminine products such as lipstick, cosmetic compacts, charm bracelets, and hair nets. Batwoman appeared regularly {{in the pages of}} Batman and Detective Comics through the early 1960s. Although letters from fans indicated Batwoman had become popular with readers, editor Julius Schwartz considered the heroine, as well as other Batman-related characters, to be inappropriate for the new direction he planned to take the Batman universe. Following the revamp to Detective Comics in 1964, Batwoman was removed from the series. The 'new' Batgirl, Barbara Gordon, not only replaced Batwoman as Batman's female counterpart, she surpassed the original heroine in popularity. Batgirl also proved to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> for her time period and the realistic approach DC Comics began taking with its characters. Unlike Batwoman, Gordon's Batgirl used a utility belt and various gadgets similar to Batman's, {{in addition to being a}} skilled martial artist and possessing a doctorate in her civilian identity. Despite requests from readers to revive Batwoman, DC's editorial staff initially declined to bring the character out of retirement, considering the fact that she was specifically created to be a love interest for Batman.|$|E
25|$|Words {{and phrases}} reflect what {{speakers}} {{of a language}} talk about. Tellingly, Esperanto has a slang expression krokodili (tocrocodile) for speaking a language other than Esperanto when Esperanto would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate,</b> such as at an Esperanto convention, whereas there is nothing equivalent in English.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{improved}} access to publicly funded French-language {{schools and the}} establishment of bilingual universities and French language community colleges has improved French-language proficiency in younger populations. In addition, the French taught in Ontario French-medium schools is an international French, which allows educated speakers to use standard forms in formal situations when it would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{shown in}} diagram at right, this {{phenomenon}} has relatively small effect if {{the standard deviation}} (as compared to the mean) is relatively small, as it makes the log-normal distribution appear similar to an arithmetical normal distribution. Thus, the arithmetical normal distribution may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> to use with small standard deviations for convenience, and the log-normal distribution with large standard deviations.|$|E
25|$|The diving reflex {{is used in}} {{clinical}} practice {{as a means to}} treat supraventricular tachycardia. This {{is an example of a}} vagal maneuver, whereby the vagus nerve is stimulated in order to block the atrioventricular node, which interrupts the abnormal electrical circuit taking place in a supraventricular tachycardia. This is especially useful in infants in whom the diving reflex is well-preserved, allowing the valsalva maneuver or carotid sinus massage to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate.</b>|$|E

Biographers suggest that it was this dialectic which defined him, forged his character and inspired his search for meaning and truth.|$|E
25|$|The term Arabic numerals is ambiguous. It most {{commonly}} {{refers to the}} numerals widely used in Europe and the Americas; to avoid confusion, Unicode calls these European digits. Arabic numerals is also the conventional name for the entire family of related numerals of Arabic and Indian numerals. It may also be intended to mean the numerals used by Arabs, in which case it generally refers to the Eastern Arabic numerals. It would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> {{to refer to the}} Arabic numeral system, where the value of a digit in a number depends on its position.|$|E
25|$|Three {{advantages}} of semantic compaction over single meaning pictures and alphabet-based systems are that a user {{need not be}} literate, symbol combinations are limited to up to just 3 at a time, and fewer symbols are required on the screen or device than with other AAC devices. A disadvantage of semantic compaction is that the user {{must be able to}} memorize codes; if a user is not cognitively capable of linking multiple icons together, he or she will not benefit from the semantic compaction system. A single-meaning icon set would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate.</b>|$|E

25|$|Bioretention systems {{involve the}} {{treatment}} of water by vegetation prior to filtration of sediment and other solids through prescribed media. Vegetation provides biological uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus and other soluble or ﬁne particulate contaminants. Bioretention systems offer a smaller footprint than other similar measures (e.g. constructed wetlands) and are commonly used to filter and treat runoff prior to it reaching street drains. Use on larger scales can be complicated and hence other devices may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate.</b> Biorentention systems comprise bioretention swales (also referred to as grassed swales and drainage channels) and bioretention basins.|$|E
25|$|PD {{is often}} {{characterized}} by a difficulty in regulating and controlling one’s stream of thought, and how memories are utilized in guiding future behaviour. Also, persons affected by PD often demonstrate perseverative behaviours such as continuing to pursue a goal after it is completed, or an inability to adopt a new strategy that may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> in achieving a goal. However, some recent research suggests that PD patients may actually be less persistent in pursuing goals than typical persons and may abandon tasks sooner when they encounter problems of {{a higher level of}} difficulty.|$|E
25|$|Japan, {{with the}} support of the United States and the United Kingdom, {{introduced}} a measure that would have restricted countries from transferring funds, material, or technology to North Korea. Russia and China, with veto power, resisted the resolution, saying a press statement should be issued. In an informal media conference, Russian UN ambassador Vitaly I. Churkin stated that, rather than sanctions, it may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>appropriate</b> for the President of the United Nations Security Council to issue a condemning statement similar to what was done after the North Korean missile firing in 1998.|$|E
