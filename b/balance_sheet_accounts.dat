50|$|The trial balance, {{which is}} usually {{prepared}} using the double-entry accounting system, forms the basis for preparing the financial statements. All the figures in the trial balance are rearranged to prepare a profit & loss statement and <b>balance</b> <b>sheet.</b> <b>Accounting</b> standards determine the format for these accounts (SSAP, FRS, IFRS).

Every <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>account</b> is proposed to be a potential vehicle to manipulate financial statements. Other receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses, employee benefits payables and long-term payables are important indicators of fraudulent financial statements. These results confirm that asset account manipulation is frequently carried out and cast doubt on earlier conclusions by researchers that inflation of liabilities {{is the most common}} source of financial statement manipulation. Prior practices of solely scaling <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> values by assets are revealed to produce spurious relationships, while scaling by both assets and sales effectively detects fraudulent financial statements and provides a useful fraud prediction tool for Chinese auditors, regulators and investors...|$|R

50|$|This was a reoccurring {{problem in}} the current {{financial}} crisis. Since the crisis unfolded, fair value assets held by banks increasingly became Level 3 inputs (unobservable).

50|$|In double-entry bookkeeping, {{expenses}} are recorded as a debit to an expense account (an income statement account) and {{a credit to}} either an asset account or a liability account, which are <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>accounts.</b> An expense decreases assets or increases liabilities. Typical business expenses include salaries, utilities, depreciation of capital assets, and interest expense for loans. The purchase of a capital asset such as a building or equipment is not an expense.|$|E
50|$|The list can use numerical, alphabetic, or {{alpha-numeric}} identifiers. However, in many computerized environments {{like the}} SIE format, only numerical identifiers are allowed.

50|$|In 2007, {{rehypothecation}} {{accounted for}} half the activity in the shadow banking system. Because the collateral is not cash it does not show up on conventional <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>accounting.</b> Before the Lehman collapse, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) calculated that US banks were receiving over $4 trillion worth of funding by rehypothecation, much of it sourced from the UK {{where there are no}} statutory limits governing the reuse of a client's collateral.

5000|$|On the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet,</b> [...] "the <b>accounts</b> {{receivable}} - installment sales" [...] {{is classified}} as current assets if it is due within 12 months of the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet.</b> Otherwise, it {{is classified as}} long term assets.|$|R
50|$|On a company's <b>balance</b> <b>sheet,</b> <b>accounts</b> {{receivable}} are {{the money}} owed to that company by entities {{outside of the}} company. Account receivables are classified as current assets assuming that they are due within one calendar year or fiscal year. To record a journal entry for a sale on account, one must debit a receivable and credit a revenue account. When the customer pays off their accounts, one debits cash and credits the receivable in the journal entry. The ending balance on the trial balance sheet for accounts receivable is usually a debit.|$|E
5000|$|The third {{indirect}} {{approach is}} the accrual reversal method (ARM), {{which is similar to}} the ANI method. But instead of using projected <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>accounts,</b> large accruals are reversed and cash effects are calculated based upon statistical distributions and algorithms. This allows the forecasting period to be weekly or even daily. It also eliminates the cumulative errors inherent in the direct, R&D method when it is extended beyond the short-term horizon. But because the ARM allocates both accrual reversals and cash effects to weeks or days, it is more complicated than the ANI or PBS indirect methods. The ARM is best suited to the medium-term forecasting horizon.|$|E
50|$|In {{financial}} accounting, a {{cash flow}} statement, {{also known as}} statement of cash flows, is a financial statement that shows how changes in <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>accounts</b> and income affect cash and cash equivalents, and breaks the analysis down to operating, investing and financing activities. Essentially, the cash flow statement {{is concerned with the}} flow of cash {{in and out of the}} business. The statement captures both the current operating results and the accompanying changes in the balance sheet. As an analytical tool, the statement of cash flows is useful in determining the short-term viability of a company, particularly its ability to pay bills. International Accounting Standard 7 (IAS 7), is the International Accounting Standard that deals with cash flow statements.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{the passage}} in 2002 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) has {{emphasized}} the need for <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>account</b> reconciliation to be included within a company's own procedures, not relying only on external auditors. The legislation was enacted “to protect shareholders and general public from accounting errors and fraudulent practices in the enterprise, as well as improve the accuracy of corporate disclosures.” SOX and other acts like it across the world have increased stress on organisations to comply. As a result, the accounting industry has sought ways to automate a previously strenuous manual process. The pressure of SOX coupled with the perennial need to mitigate erroneous reconciliation in the process.|$|R
5000|$|In accounting, {{book value}} {{is the value}} of an asset {{according}} to its <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>account</b> <b>balance.</b> For assets, the value is based on the original cost of the asset less any depreciation, amortization or impairment costs made against the asset. Traditionally, a company's book value is its total assets minus intangible assets and liabilities. [...] However, in practice, depending on the source of the calculation, book value may variably include goodwill, intangible assets, or both. [...] The value inherent in its workforce, part of the Intellectual capital of a company, is always ignored. When intangible assets and goodwill are explicitly excluded, the metric is often specified to be [...] "tangible book value".|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} generic <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> for the USA and {{a developing}} country.

The liabilities of financial institutions (FIs) are equity and their assets are the equity offerings of firms and households. Households are rentiers holding the equity of both the entities. The government oversees the operation of SFC norms. The input-output system of the developing economy is a contrast.

5000|$|Banks’ asset {{categories}} are mostly {{made up of}} loans and leases, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, and trading assets. Loans and leases comprise {{the biggest and most}} important category for most banks. These assets are classified as either “held-for-investment,” or “held-for-sale”, accounted for at the lower of historical cost or fair value. Ultimately, most of the assets held by financial institutions were either not subject to fair value, or did not impact the income statement or <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>accounts.</b> [...] However, a large minority of the assets were “held-for-sale” or trading assets. The loans and securities in the held-for-sale classification are tested for impairment and, if impaired, written down to the present value of future cash flows. Loans are usually impaired because creditors will be unable to collect all amounts due but if classified as “held-for-sale” can also be deemed impaired under FAS157 if their market value falls {{for an extended period of}} time.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{amortization}} on {{the presentation of}} the financial statements are quite noticeable when calculating the profit before tax as well as for its recognition in the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet.</b> <b>Accounting</b> amortization changes the value of the fixed assets itemized in the assets column, while the related expense changes the profit and loss account.

The differences between accounting amortization and tax amortization generate temporary differences that are either taxable or deductible, and these are matters that will be analysed under circumstances when the deferred tax method is applied. The recognition {{of the value of the}} deferred tax in the profit and loss account for each type of temporary difference would be a step towards the separation of financial accounting from taxation...|$|R
50|$|The core {{activities}} of investment banks {{are subject to}} regulation and monitoring by central banks and other government institutions - {{but it has been}} common practice for investment banks to conduct many of their transactions in ways that do not show up on their conventional <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>accounting</b> and so are not visible to regulators or unsophisticated investors. For example, prior to the 2007-2012 financial crisis, investment banks financed mortgages through off-balance sheet (OBS) securitizations (e.g. asset-backed commercial paper programs) and hedged risk through off-balance sheet credit default swaps. Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, major investment banks were subject to considerably less stringent regulation than depository banks. In 2008, investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs became bank holding companies, Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns were acquired by bank holding companies, and Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy, essentially bringing the largest investment banks into the regulated depository sphere.|$|R
