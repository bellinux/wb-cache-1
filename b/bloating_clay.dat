40|$|AbstractHigh {{strength}} or construction <b>bloating</b> <b>clay</b> {{is widely used}} in construction operations especially in construction of roads, bridges, airfield pavement. It replaces crushed stone as an aggregate. Technology of high strength <b>bloating</b> <b>clay</b> requires essential changes in its stoving curve {{in comparison with the}} production of light <b>bloating</b> <b>clay.</b> It is shown that in order to solve an urgent construction problem of <b>bloating</b> <b>clay</b> release it is necessary to conduct monitoring of temperature pattern in a rotary kiln in several distinctive cross sections and conduct management of a kiln as an object with distributed constants with the use of several, especially three, concentrated control actions. The developed mathematical model of stoving process and methodology of computing experiment, exemplified by the 40 × 2, 5 м kiln, allowed to find operating areas of condition and management of an automated object, focused on <b>bloating</b> <b>clay</b> release with assigned strength...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} research project {{it was determined}} that it is technically feasible to manufacture a light-weight aggregate resembling <b>bloated</b> <b>clay</b> from line grained sedimentation and mud by adding clay and other supplements. The present report documents the large-scale plans for an approved plant located in Marbach am Neckar designed for the economical and environmentally-sound disposal of 45. 000 m" 3 of dredged material per year from the River Neckar. The dredged sediment from the Neckar will be taken to the plant by ship, temporarily stored in large basins, fractionated, mechanically dewatered and then processed into a light-weight aggregate according to DIN 4226 by being heated to over 1100 C in a rotary cylindrical kiln. The bulk density of the aggregate is approx. 500 kg/m" 3. A multi-level flue gas purification system is connected to the kiln ensuring that the emissions remain considerably below the legally required limits. In this way the process guarantees the optimal disposal of the harmful organic substances in the sediment and mud, and the highly stable bonding of the non-volatile heavy metals. (orig.)
