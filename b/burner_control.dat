Algoma Steel Inc. contracted FLOWCARE Engineering Inc. to determine the root source of the problem and design a solution.

Since the early 1980 's, Praxair's oxy-fuel combustion technol. has found wide applications in the steel industry, glass furnaces, waste/hazardous waste incineration, and cement kilns, etc. Energy savings of 40 - 60 % in steel reheating furnaces, a combination of 30 - 40 % fuel savings and 50 - 90 % NOx reduction in glass furnaces, are among the limits that have been achieved in industrial scale operation using Praxair's oxy-fuel combustion technol.

40|$|Three {{different}} corn types (yellow dent, waxy and white) {{were used}} {{in a set of}} desorption and adsorption equilibrium moisture content (EMC) experiments. The ranges of temperature and moisture content (MC) for the tests were 0 to 25 °C and 12 to 20 %. The main conclusion was that the three corn types investigated had different adsorption and desorption EMC relationships. These corn type specific relationships were incorporated into a new model-based fan and <b>burner</b> <b>control</b> strategy for the in-bin drying and conditioning of corn. This Self-Adapting Variable Heat (SAVH) strategy incorporated the Thompson equilibrium drying model to predict MC changes in different layers of the grain mass. The drying model allowed the SAVH control strategy to successfully identify wet or dry weather conditions and target a uniform final MC for the entire grain mass. ^ This SAVH control strategy was successfully implemented in three field experiments during the 2004 drying season. The Post-Harvest Aeration and Storage Simulation Tool–Finite Difference Method (PHAST-FDM) software was further refined and validated by comparing the observed MC values for four natural air/low temperature (NA/LT) in-bin drying experiments with the predicted MC values. ^ On the basis of a 40 -year analysis of weather data with respect to the performance of NA/LT in-bin drying systems, the Midwestern Corn Belt was divided into four regions. PHAST-FDM was used to study the performance of four NA/LT in-bin drying strategies for drying 20 % initial. ^ On the basis of a 40 -year analysis of weather data with respect to the performance of NA/LT in-bin drying systems, the Midwestern Corn Belt was divided into four regions. PHAST-FDM was used to study the performance of four NA/LT in-bin drying strategies for drying 20 % initial MC corn in 13 locations within these regions. The simulation results showed that the SAVH strategy outperformed the other strategies on the basis of drying costs (from 1. 1 to 9. 6 $/t lower drying cost), drying time, and relatively little overdrying of the grain bottom layer. The drying cost for the yellow dent corn type was always the lowest, followed by the white and then by the waxy corn types. ^ The fine material distribution in the grain mass and the air velocity through the core and periphery locations in the bin were quantified for 15 NA/LT in-bin drying field tests. The best management practices of leveling the grain peak after filling the bin and coring the grain mass were implemented, and the improvement on the airflow distribution was quantified. Simulation results showed that operators of NA/LT in-bin drying systems could reduce drying costs from 25 to 33 % by leveling the grain peak after loading the bin. An additional savings of 18 to 22 % could be achieved by installing effective grain (and fine material) distributors or by coring the grain mass. ...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays most of {{the energy}} needed comes from fossil fuels such as natural gas (NG). Dwindling stocks of all fossil fuels, {{including}} locally occurring natural gas reservoirs, have spurred the effort to both decrease dependence on local fuels and switch to renewable, green energy. The drawback to gas sources like Subsitute Natural Gas (SNG), Biogas or Syngas {{is that they are}} too variable in composition to be readily mixed into the existing gas infrastructure. An electrical gas sensor with continuous data output needs to be developed for production safety, <b>burner</b> <b>control</b> and measuring the value of the gas. Photoacoustic infrared absorption (PAS) is a good measurement principle to measure the composition of gas. Three components are essential for a photoacoustic system: a modulated light source emitting light in the spectrum which the target gas absorbs, a pressure sensor, usually a microphone and a photoacoustic cell to hold the sample. In this cell the photoacoustic signal is generated. The PA-signal can be at a resonance frequency of the cell, in which case the cell functions as an acoustical amplifier. The parameter to describe this amplification is the Q-factor. The composition of gas from different sources creates a list of gases that are possibly included in the mixture. The components are classified in four categories: combustible fuel sources, hazardous gases, neutral gases and other gases. For each of these components, Non-dispersive infrared absorption (NDIR), Thermal conductivity detection (TCD) and PAS are considered as sensor principles. The function and requirements of the sensor have to be determined before starting the design and follow from the application of the sensor. This thesis proposes a six step design methodology for designing a PA-sensor. It is a structured approach which tries to divide the process in discrete steps. Because the acoustic behavior of the cell is very important, the resonance profile has to be determined. Analytically calculating the behavior of sound inside the cell is only possible for simple structures. Therefore two methods of acoustic profiling are considered: experimentally and by modelling the acoustic behaviour with the Finite Element Method (FEM) software tool COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 1. Measurements were done on different sizes and shapes of resonance chambers in the laboratory. First measurements are performed on simple structures, which show clear longitudinal resonances. Later more complex structures are discussed as well. Measuring gives an good acoustic profile, but to create a large scale model sample chamber takes a lot of effort. Therefore, measuring is useful when verifying a design, but not during the design phase. FEM simulations do not have these drawbacks. Using COMSOL in the design process gives the possibility to do an eigen frequency analysis and a frequency domain analysis. Simulation results are compared with measurements to build confidence in the simulations. Three design cases are discussed. First choosing the position of source and microphone is discussed, then the complexity, meshing and simulation time of the model, and finally excitation by two sources. COMSOL is a good tool to help design the acoustical properties of the sample chamber. Electronic InstrumentationMicroelectronicsElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new, efficient technique for computing first-order spatial dependence of a furnace flame. The technique, called the moving boundary flame model, creates dynamic state variables that track {{the size of}} the flame within the furnace. The approximation is appropriate for full plant training simulators, control system analysis, and engineering analyses in which a higher fidelity model than a point reactor model is needed. In comparison to the point reactor models, the one dimensional spatial dependence should improve the accuracy of distributed quantities such as heat transfer and reaction rates over the range fuel and air flow conditions that exist in normal and abnormal operation. The model is not intended to replace detailed multi-dimension flow models of the furnace. Although the flame model is a first principles model, the accuracy depends on data from a more detailed combustion simulation or experimental data for volume-averaged parameters such as the turbulent mixing coefficient for fuel and air, radiative and conductive heat transfer coefficients, and ignition and extinction conditions. These inputs can be viewed as tuning parameters used normalize the moving boundary model to a more accurate model at a particular operating point.

40|$|This project {{led to an}} {{improved}} understanding of the mechanisms of dross formation. The microstructural evolution in industrial dross samples was determined. Results suggested that dross that forms in layers with structure and composition determined by the local magnesium concentration alone. This finding is supported by fundamental studies of molten metal surfaces. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data revealed that only magnesium segregates to the molten aluminum alloy surface and reacts to form a growing oxide layer. X-ray diffraction techniques that were using to investigate an oxidizing molten aluminum alloy surface confirmed {{for the first time}} that magnesium oxide is the initial crystalline phase that forms during metal oxidation. The analytical techniques developed in this project are now available to investigate other molten metal surfaces. Based on the improved understanding of dross initiation, formation and growth, technology was developed to minimize melt loss. The concept is based on covering the molten metal surface with a reusable physical barrier. Tests in a laboratory-scale reverberatory furnace confirmed the results of bench-scale tests. The main highlights of the work done include: A clear understanding of the kinetics of dross formation and the effect of different alloying elements on dross formation was obtained. It was determined that the dross evolves in similar ways regardless of the aluminum alloy being melted and the results showed that amorphous aluminum nitride forms first, followed by amorphous magnesium oxide and crystalline magnesium oxide in all alloys that contain magnesium. Evaluation of the molten aluminum alloy surface during melting and holding indicated that magnesium oxide is the first crystalline phase to form during oxidation of a clean aluminum alloy surface. Based on dross evaluation and melt tests it became clear that the major contributing factor to aluminum alloy dross was in the alloys with Mg content. Mg was identified as the primary factor that accelerates dross formation specifically in the transition from two phases to three phase growth. Limiting magnesium oxidation on the surface of molten aluminum therefore becomes the key to minimizing melt loss, and technology was developed to prevent magnesium oxidation on the aluminum surface. This resulted in a lot of the work being focused on the control of Mg oxidation. Two potential molten metal covering agents that could inhibit dross formation during melting and holding consisting of boric acid and boron nitride were identified. The latter was discounted by industry as it resulted in Boron pick up by the melt beyond that allowed by specifications during plant trials. The understanding of the kinetics of dross formation by the industry partners helped them understand how temperature, alloy chemistry and furnace atmosphere (<b>burner</b> <b>controls</b> [...] e. g. excess air) effected dross formation. This enables them to introduce in their plant process changes that reduced unnecessary holding at high temperatures, <b>control</b> <b>burner</b> configurations, reduce door openings to avoid ingress of air and optimize charge mixes to ensure rapid melting and avoid excess oxidation...|$|R

The flames were experimentally investigated using a retractable central tube within the main <b>burner</b> to <b>control</b> the degree of mixing at the exit. A five-gas (C 2 H 2, H 2, CO 2, N 2, air) co–flow pilot located outside the burner was used to match the composition and adiabatic temperature of a stoichiometric methane/air flame. The applied hybrid method features a flow field calculation using a time-dependent finite-volume based method closed at the second-moment level with the scalar field obtained at the joint-scalar (JPDF) level. The current methodology is applicable to both premixed combustion and diffusion- dominated regions without assumption regarding the inclusion of the chemistry. Results show that the current method can accurately capture the stratified premixed flame mode near the burner exit as well as the diffusion-dominated flame far downstream.
