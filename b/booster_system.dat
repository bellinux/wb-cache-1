25|$|The HL-20 {{concept of}} the PLS is {{adaptable}} to several launch vehicle concepts. Titan III was an existing <b>booster</b> <b>system</b> {{which could have been}} used for unmanned prototype launches or, with modification, as a manned system. A future launch system option would have been the National Launch System under study by the Air Force and NASA in the 1990s. Choice of a launch system for the HL-20 PLS would depend both on the required date of initial PLS operations and the cost of booster development and launches.|$|E
25|$|The most {{recognizable}} external change {{was the use}} of the three-panel Erla-Haube clear-view canopy, which filled the entire canopy length behind the four-panel windscreen unit, which eliminated the older, rear fixed canopy section. Internal changes included inheriting the new 2,000W generator and the DB 605 D-2 engine of the 109K. Apart from the standardised streamlined engine cowlings, G-10s with the DB605 D-2 were equipped as standard with the MW-50 <b>booster</b> <b>system</b> (DB 605DM, later 605DB) and had a larger Fo 987 oil cooler housed in a deeper fairing. Also, because of the engine's enlarged crankcase and the oil return lines which ran in front of it, these G-10s had small blister fairings incorporated into the lower engine cowlings, forward of and below the exhaust stacks. The radio antenna mast was also removed from atop the rear fuselage turtledeck, and replaced with {{what appears to be the}} swept-back antenna from the Me 163B Komet rocket fighter, but oriented in reverse from the rocket fighter's mount, in being swept forward instead from its port wing leading edge underside mount on the G-10 subtype.|$|E

2500|$|As a bipropellant, [...] is {{decomposed}} to burn a fuel as an oxidizer. Specific impulses {{as high as}} 350 s (3.5kN·s/kg) can be achieved, {{depending on}} the fuel. Peroxide used as an oxidizer gives a somewhat lower Isp than liquid oxygen, but is dense, storable, noncryogenic and can be more easily used to drive gas turbines to give high pressures using an efficient closed cycle. It {{can also be used}} for regenerative cooling of rocket engines. Peroxide was used very successfully as an oxidizer in World War II German rocket motors (e.g. T-Stoff, containing oxyquinoline stabilizer, for both the Walter HWK 109-500 Starthilfe RATO externally podded monopropellant <b>booster</b> <b>system,</b> and for the Walter HWK 109-509 rocket motor series used for the Me 163B), most often used with C-Stoff in a self-igniting hypergolic combination, and for the low-cost British Black Knight and Black Arrow launchers.|$|E

50|$|Postflight {{investigation}} {{found that the}} fuel prevalves had only opened partially and the propellant flow force was enough to push them shut, starving the booster engines of RP-1 and causing a LOX-rich shutdown. Engine start had proceeded normally and all <b>booster</b> <b>systems</b> functioned properly until the prevalves closed. Bench testing confirmed that there were several possible ways that the prevalves would only open partially, and in this case, {{it appeared to be}} the result of an incorrectly-installed pressure transducer. This failure mode had never occurred in the 240 Atlas launches prior to AC-5 although it had always been possible. To prevent a recurrence, the prevalves were equipped with a lock that would be enabled during the prelaunch countdown.|$|R

40|$|The SPEAR 2 {{accelerator}} system originally had 3 RF stations (2 for storage ring, 1 Booster) operating at 358. 5 MHz. SPEAR 3 now operates at 476. 3 MHz with the PEP-II type RF <b>system,</b> while the <b>Booster</b> RF frequency remains unchanged. For top-off operation, the Booster injects single 3. 0 GeV electron bunches into SPEAR 3 at 10 Hz every 5 minutes to replenish lost charge. Due {{to the frequency}} mismatch between SPEAR 3 and the Booster, only one SPEAR 3 bucket can injected per shot limiting injection rate and overall system flexibility. The aging high-power RF subsystems of the Booster pose a reliability issue as well. In order to remove these constraints, studies are underway to replace the <b>Booster</b> RF <b>system</b> using the PEP-II type RF system as a baseline. The new <b>Booster</b> RF <b>system</b> will be tuned to 475. 036 MHz, and phase-locked to the SPEAR 3 RF system. The project calls for ramping the Booster cavity gap voltage to 0. 80 MV at 10 Hz, each with a 40 ms acceleration interval. With very low beam loading and low average RF power, there are many subsystems that can be operationally simplified. In this paper we present the results of analysis leading to a new <b>Booster</b> RF <b>system...</b>|$|R
