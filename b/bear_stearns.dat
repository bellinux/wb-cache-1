5|$|Over the years, KKR {{has seen}} the {{departure}} of many of its original partners, the most notable being original co-founder Jerome Kohlberg. After {{a leave of absence}} due to an illness in 1985, Kohlberg returned to find increasing differences in strategy with his partners Kravis and Roberts. In 1987, Kohlberg left KKR to found a new private equity firm Kohlberg & Company. Kohlberg & Company returned to the investment style that Kohlberg had originally practiced at <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> and in KKR's earlier years, acquiring smaller, middle-market companies.|$|E
5|$|Their {{acquisition}} of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 {{is among the}} first significant leveraged buyout transactions. In the following years the three <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973), as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. Despite a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy.|$|E

Since its founding, KKR has completed a number of transactions including the 1989 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, which was the largest buyout in history to that point, as well as the 2007 buyout of TXU, which is currently the largest buyout completed to date. KKR has completed investments in over 160 companies since 1977, completing at least one investment in every year except in 1982 and in 1990.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{factor contributing to}} the game's protracted development was that Broussard was continually looking to add new elements to the game. A running joke at 3D Realms was to stop Broussard from seeing a new video game, as {{he would want to}} include portions of it in Duke Nukem Forever. Later that year, Broussard decided to upgrade to {{a new version of the}} Unreal engine that was designed for multiplayer matches. Former employees recalled that Broussard did not have a plan for what the finished game would look like. At the same time, GT Interactive was facing higher-than-expected losses and hired <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> to look into selling the company or merging it. Later that year, Infogrames Entertainment announced it was purchasing a controlling interest in GT Interactive. The publishing rights for Duke Nukem Forever passed to Gathering of Developers in early December 2000.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2007, <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> & Co. Inc. was {{the fifth}} largest {{investment}} bank in the United States but its market capitalization had deteriorated through {{the second half of}} 2007. On Friday, March 14, 2008, <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> lost 47% of its equity market value to close at $30.00 per share as rumors emerged that clients were withdrawing capital from the bank. Over the following weekend, it emerged that <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> might prove insolvent, and on or around March 15, 2008, the Federal Reserve engineered a deal to prevent a wider systemic crisis from the collapse of <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns.</b>|$|E

25|$|On March 16, 2008, after {{a weekend}} of intense {{negotiations}} between JPMorgan, Bear, and the federal government, JPMorgan Chase announced that it had plans to acquire <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> in a stock swap worth $2.00 per share or $240million pending shareholder approval scheduled within 90 days. In the interim, JPMorgan Chase agreed to guarantee all <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> trades and business process flows. Two days later on March 18, 2008, JPMorgan Chase formally announced the acquisition of <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> for $236million. The stock swap agreement was signed in the late-night hours of March 18, 2008, with JPMorgan agreeing to exchange 0.05473 of each of its shares upon closure of the merger for one Bear share, valuing the Bear shares at $2 each.|$|E
25|$|The Clear Channel forward sales {{agreement}} with <b>Bear,</b> <b>Stearns</b> & Co. Inc was terminated on August 2, 2006. The termination resulted in Clear Channel Investments, Inc. paying <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> {{a total of}} $83.1 million, which was the value of Clear Channel's stake in XM. The accreted value of the debt was $92.9 million, and the fair value of the collar was an asset of $6.0 million, {{which resulted in a}} net gain of $3.8 million for Clear Channel.|$|E

25|$|Weill, {{shortly after}} graduating from Cornell University, got his first job on Wall Street in 1955 â€“ as a runner for <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns.</b> In 1956, he became a {{licensed}} broker at <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns.</b> Rather than making phone calls or personal visits to solicit clients, Weill found he was far more comfortable sitting at his desk, poring through companies' financial statements and disclosures made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. For weeks his only client was his mother, Etta, until Joan persuaded an ex-boyfriend to open a brokerage account.|$|E
25|$|On March 24, 2008, after {{considerable}} public discontent by <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> shareholders {{over the}} low acquisition price threatened the deal's closure, a revised offer was announced at approximately $10 per share. Under the revised terms, JPMorgan also immediately acquired a 39.5% stake in <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> (using newly issued shares) {{at the new}} offer price and gained a commitment from the board (representing another 10% of the share capital) that its members would {{vote in favor of}} the new deal. With sufficient commitments to ensure a successful shareholder vote, the merger was completed on May 30, 2008.|$|E

25|$|The support {{given by}} Federal Reserve Board, under Ben Bernanke, and the US Treasury with Paulson at the helm, in the {{acquisition}} of <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> by J.P. Morgan and the $200bn facility made available to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac attracted {{a great deal of}} criticism in congress by both Republicans and Democrats. Paulson and Geithner made every effort to enable Barclays to acquire Lehman Brothers, including convincing other large Wall Street firms to commit their own funds to support the deal. In light of the recent <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> criticism, Paulson was against committing public funds towards a bailout, for fear of being labelled 'Mr Bailout'. When British regulators indicated they would not approve the purchase, Lehman went into bankruptcy, and Paulson and Geithner worked to contain the systemic impact.|$|E
25|$|The highly generous pay {{packages}} include $172 {{million for}} Merrill Lynch & Co.

25|$|This {{invention}} gained rapid {{acceptance by}} others, e.g. Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers. The former issued 250 million dollars' worth of complex securities (equivalent to about 3.75 billion in today's money) in 1929. Lehman issued similar obligations, which immediately rose 30 percent. Enron used them extensively {{and in the}} recent financial crisis they {{played a major role}} in bringing down <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> and Lehman Brothers.|$|E

Eventually, Gardner was recruited by <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> & Company in San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, while {{testifying before}} Senator Arlen Specter and the Senate Judiciary Committee about Mack, Pequot Capital and the SEC lack of oversight, {{he warned that}} SEC {{enforcement}} was dangerously lax. He said that the SEC had recovered a mere $110,000 from hedge fund insider trading over one year when the Committee itself had found evidence that over a one-year period, more than 41% of all mergers and acquisitions of over a billion dollars involved insider trading. Aguirre warned that lack of effective oversight of rampant corruption was allowing Wall Street the same unregulated market abuse and leveraging that caused the Wall Street crash of 1929. In 2008, he delivered a similar message at the Sibos conference in Vienna. Just prior {{to the collapse of}} <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns,</b> he {{wrote a letter to the}} Senate Banking Committee that the nation's banks, and particularly <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns,</b> were at risk because of subprime debt exposure and credit default swaps. In September 2008, during the debate on the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), Aguirre's projections on the costs of the taxpayer bailout were cited on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E

However, the SEC indicated that it was willing to consider allowing actively managed ETFs that are not fully transparent in the future, and later actively managed ETFs have sought alternatives to full transparency.|$|E
25|$|Five World Trade Center was {{designed}} by Kohn Pedersen Fox and will stand where the Deutsche Bank Building once stood. On June 22, 2007, the Port Authority announced that JP Morgan Chase will lease the 42-story building for its investment banking headquarters; however, JPMorgan's March 2008 acquisition of <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> had caused construction to stagnate, as the company changed its plans and relocated its headquarters to 383 Madison Avenue. Construction began on September 9, 2011. Although the foundation was completed, construction on the main structure never commenced.|$|E
25|$|Bush {{responded to}} the early signs of {{economic}} problems with lump-sum tax rebates and other stimulative measures in the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. In March 2008, <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns,</b> a major US investment bank heavily invested in subprime mortgage derivatives, began to go under. Rumors of low cash reserves dragged Bear's stock price down while lenders to Bear began to withdraw their cash. The Federal Reserve funneled an emergency loan to Bear through JP Morgan Chase. (As an investment bank, Bear could not borrow from the Fed but JP Morgan Chase, a commercial bank, could).|$|E
25|$|Despite this claim, some {{well-documented}} {{cases are}} known {{where it is}} alleged {{that there has been}} considerable slippage in corporate governance {{on the part of some}} public companies. The dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, and the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007â€“08, are classical examples of corporate mismanagement. Companies like Pets.com (2000), Enron (2001), One.Tel (2001), Sunbeam (2001), Webvan (2001), Adelphia (2002), MCI WorldCom (2002), Parmalat (2003), American International Group (2008), <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> (2008), Lehman Brothers (2008), General Motors (2009) and Satyam Computer Services (2009) were among the most widely scrutinized by the media.|$|E
25|$|In 1987 Kudlow was rehired by <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> as {{its chief}} {{economist}} and senior managing director. He {{was fired in}} 1994 after abuse of cocaine caused him to skip an important client presentation. Kudlow later admitted to a $10,000 a month cocaine habit. Kudlow also served as an economic counsel to A. B. Laffer & Associates, the San Diego, California, company owned by Arthur Laffer, a major supply-side economist and creator of the Laffer curve, an economic theory tying lower taxation levels to increased government revenues, at least at some taxation rates.|$|E
25|$|The seven largest Wall Street {{firms in}} the 2000s were <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns,</b> JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup Incorporated, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers. During the {{recession}} of 2008â€“10, many of these firms, including Lehman, {{went out of business}} or were bought up at firesale prices by other financial firms. In 2008, Lehman filed for bankruptcy, <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> was bought by JP Morgan Chase forced by the U.S. government, and Merrill Lynch was bought by Bank of America in a similar shot-gun wedding. These failures marked a catastrophic downsizing of Wall Street as the financial industry goes through restructuring and change. Since New York's financial industry provides almost one-fourth of all income produced in the city, and accounts for 10% of the city's tax revenues and 20% of the state's, the downturn has had huge repercussions for government treasuries. New York's mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly over a four-year period dangled over $100 million in tax incentives to persuade Goldman Sachs to build a 43-story headquarters in the financial district near the destroyed World Trade Center site. In 2009, things looked somewhat gloomy, with one analysis by the Boston Consulting Group suggesting that 65,000 jobs had been permanently lost because of the downturn. But there were signs that Manhattan property prices were rebounding with price rises of 9% annually in 2010, and bonuses were being paid once more, with average bonuses over $124,000 in 2010.|$|E
25|$|As {{the crisis}} began to unfold, Citigroup {{announced}} on April 11, 2007, {{that it would}} eliminate 17,000 jobs, or about 5 percent of its workforce, in a broad restructuring designed {{to cut costs and}} bolster its long underperforming stock. Even after securities and brokerage firm <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> ran into serious trouble in summer 2007, Citigroup decided the possibility of trouble with its CDO's was so tiny (less than 1/100 of 1%) that they excluded them from their risk analysis. With the crisis worsening, Citigroup announced on January 7, 2008 that it was considering cutting another 5 percent to 10 percent of its 327,000 member-workforce.|$|E
25|$|JPMorgan Chase, in {{its current}} structure, {{is the result of}} the {{combination}} of several large U.S. banking companies since 1996, including Chase Manhattan Bank, J.P. Morgan & Co., Bank One, <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> and Washington Mutual. Going back further, its predecessors include major banking firms among which are Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover, First Chicago Bank, National Bank of Detroit, Texas Commerce Bank, Providian Financial and Great Western Bank. The company's oldest predecessor institution, the Bank of the Manhattan Company, was the third oldest banking corporation in the United States, and the 31st oldest bank in the world, having been established on September 1, 1799 by Aaron Burr.|$|E
25|$|On , 2007, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey {{announced}} that JP Morgan Chase will build Tower 5, a 42-story building on Site 5 {{occupied by the}} Deutsche Bank Building, and Kohn Pedersen Fox {{was selected as the}} architect for the building. Four renowned architectsâ€”including Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, who designed the transit hub; One WTC designer David Childs of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill; and the British architect Norman Foster of Foster and Partners, who designed Tower Two and masterminded the diamond designâ€”would greatly enhance the street-level atmosphere of the rebuilt site. However, JPMorgan's March 2008 acquisition of <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> caused construction on Tower 5 to stagnate, as the company changed its plans and relocated its headquarters to 383 Madison Avenue.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 {{financial}} credit crisis {{led to the}} collapse of several notable investment banks, such as the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers (one of the largest investment banks in the world) and the hurried sale of Merrill Lynch and the much smaller <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> to much larger banks, which effectively rescued them from bankruptcy. The entire financial services industry, including numerous investment banks, was rescued by government loans through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Surviving U.S. investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley converted to traditional bank holding companies to accept TARP relief. Similar situations occurred across the globe with countries rescuing their banking industry. Initially, banks received part of a $700 billion TARP intended to stabilize the economy and thaw the frozen credit markets. Eventually, taxpayer assistance to banks reached nearly $13 trillion, most without much scrutiny, lending did not increase and credit markets remained frozen.|$|E
25|$|Israel's {{thriving}} {{venture capital}} industry has {{played an important}} role in funding the country's booming high-technology sector. The country is now teeming with hundreds of prosperous Israeli private equity and venture firms looking to invest in the next potential million or billion dollar business startup. Many of Israel's venture capital firms have billions of dollars under management that are seeking to invest in domestic Israeli companies in order to create value by marking a strong presence across the country. The financial crisis of 2007â€“08 also affected the availability of venture capital locally. In 2009, there were 63 mergers and acquisitions in the Israeli market worth a total of $2.54 billion; 7% below 2008 levels ($2.74 billion), when 82 Israeli companies were merged or acquired, and 33% lower than 2007 proceeds ($3.79 billion) when 87 Israeli companies were merged or acquired. Numerous Israeli high tech companies have been acquired by global corporations for its reliable corporate management and quality personnel. In addition to venture capital funds, many of the world's leading investment banks, pension funds, and insurance companies have a strong presence in Israel committing their funds to financially back Israeli high-tech firms and benefit from its prosperous high tech sector. These institutional investors include Goldman Sachs, <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns,</b> Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Credit Swiss First Boston, Merrill Lynch, CalPERS, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, and AIG.|$|E

500|$|The {{industry}} that is today described as private equity was conceived {{by a number of}} corporate financiers, most notably Jerome Kohlberg, Jr. and later his protÃ©gÃ©, Henry Kravis. [...] Working for <b>Bear</b> <b>Stearns</b> at the time, Kohlberg and Kravis along with Kravis' cousin George Roberts began a series of what they described as [...] "bootstrap" [...] investments. [...] They targeted family-owned businesses, many of which had been founded in the years following World War II and by the 1960s and 1970s were facing succession issues. [...] Many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors, making a sale to a financial buyer potentially attractive. [...] Their acquisition of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions.
