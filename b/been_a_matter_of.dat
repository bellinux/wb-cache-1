5|$|Adolf Hitler's {{sexuality}} {{has long}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> historical and scholarly debate. There {{is evidence that}} he had romantic encounters {{with a number of}} women during his lifetime, as well as evidence of his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence of homosexual encounters. His name has been linked to a number of possible female lovers, two of whom committed suicide. Another died of complications eight years after a suicide attempt, and one made a failed suicide attempt.|$|E

Thousands of Orangemen and loyalists {{engaged in a}} standoff with the police and army at Drumcree Church.

5|$|Chopin's {{disease and}} the cause of his death have since <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> discussion. His death {{certificate}} gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his physician, Jean Cruveilhier, was then the leading French authority on this disease. Other possibilities have been advanced including cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. In 2017, an autopsy was performed on Chopin's preserved heart, which confirmed that a rare case of pericarditis, caused by complications from chronic tuberculosis, was the likely cause of his death.|$|E
5|$|Display of British and Singapore ensigns on island. Ensigns, {{associated}} with maritime matters, are marks of nationality and not sovereignty. Singapore had also not demonstrated any sovereign intent in the flying of the British and Singapore ensigns from Horsburgh Lighthouse. The Pulau Pisang incident {{was not an}} acknowledgement by Malaysia of Singapore's sovereignty over Pedra Branca; it had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> domestic political sensibility – Pulau Pisang is much larger than Pedra Branca and has a small local population.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Italy, Audisio's {{version of}} how Mussolini was {{executed}} {{has largely been}} accepted and is uncontroversial. However, within Italy, the subject has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> extensive debate and dispute since the late 1940s to the present {{and a variety of}} theories of how Mussolini died has proliferated. At least 12 different individuals have been identified at various times as being responsible for carrying out the shooting. Comparisons have been made with the John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories, and it has been described as the Italian equivalent of that speculation.|$|E

5|$|Pauline Bonaparte is {{represented}} as immature, expecting an ideal life of fantasy in the Caribbean, while engaging in affairs with young officers. Her {{function in the}} novel has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> debate, with different critics viewing her as a representation of white decadence, the immorality of the colony, or sexuality. It is a statue of Pauline that causes the beginning of Solimán's madness.|$|E
5|$|Royal {{intermarriage}} is {{the practice}} of members of ruling dynasties marrying into other reigning families. It was more commonly {{done in the past}} as part of strategic diplomacy for national interest.

5|$|Warwick's {{historical}} legacy has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> much dispute. Historical opinion has alternated between seeing him as self-centred and rash, and regarding {{him as a}} victim of the whims of an ungrateful king. It is generally agreed, however, that in his own time he enjoyed great popularity in all layers of society, and that he was skilled at appealing to popular sentiments for political support.|$|E
5|$|By this point, the Luftwaffe had {{subjected}} the UK {{to a major}} {{air campaign}} and caused {{an enormous amount of}} destruction and displacement of civilians. However, it failed to bring the UK to peace talks, nor had any obvious effect on economic output. At the end of May the Germans called off The Blitz, and from then on the UK would be subject to dramatically lower rates of bombing. How much of this was due to the effects of the night fighter force has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> considerable debate among historians. The Germans were turning their attention eastward, and most of the Luftwaffe was sent to support these efforts. Even in May, the losses represent only 2.4% of the attacking force, a tiny number that was easily replaceable by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> debate why the Renaissance began in Florence, and not {{elsewhere}} in Italy. Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine cultural life {{that may have}} caused such a cultural movement. Many have emphasized {{the role played by}} the Medici, a banking family and later ducal ruling house, in patronizing and stimulating the arts. Lorenzo de' Medici (1449–1492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from the leading artists of Florence, including Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, and Michelangelo Buonarroti. Works by Neri di Bicci, Botticelli, da Vinci and Filippino Lippi had been commissioned additionally by the convent di San Donato agli Scopeti of the Augustinians order in Florence.|$|E

5|$|Molecular dating {{indicates}} the caballoid lineage diverged from the non-caballoids 4 mya. Genetic {{results suggest that}} all North American fossils of caballine equines, as well as South American fossils traditionally placed in the subgenus E. (Amerhippus), belong to E. ferus. Remains attributed {{to a variety of}} species and lumped together as New World stilt-legged horses (including E. francisci, E. tau, and E. quinni) probably all belong to a second species that was endemic to North America. The possible causes of the extinction of horses in the Americas (ca. 12,000 years ago) have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> debate. Hypotheses include climate change and overexploitation by newly arrived humans. Horses only returned to the American mainland {{with the arrival of the}} conquistadors in 1519.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} of the woman has also <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> debate. The inscription which accompanies her image clearly includes her title, despotissa, {{as well as the}} word “daughter”. Based on a possible reading of her name as Anna, she has been identified as Anna Neda, the Serbian wife of Michael Shishman, which is in line with the first identification of the despot. Nikolova believes that {{it is possible that the}} woman is Anna Neda even if the despot is her son rather than her husband. She theorises that Anna Neda settled in Vidin after Michael Shishman's second marriage and owned a personal domain which included Donja Kamenica. Another reading of the inscription deciphers the name of the despotissa as Elena.|$|E
5|$|The top 10% paid 51.8% {{of total}} federal taxes in 2009, {{and the top}} 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax {{national}} income, paid 22.3% of federal taxes. In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and −2.7% for the bottom quintile. The incidence of corporate income tax has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> considerable ongoing controversy for decades. State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.|$|E

5|$|William {{assembled}} a large invasion fleet and an army gathered from Normandy {{and the rest}} of France, including large contingents from Brittany and Flanders. He spent almost nine months on his preparations, as he had to construct a fleet from nothing. According to some Norman chronicles, he also secured diplomatic support, although the accuracy of the reports has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> historical debate. The most famous claim is that Pope Alexander II gave a papal banner as a token of support, which only appears in William of Poitiers's account, and not in more contemporary narratives. In April 1066 Halley's Comet appeared in the sky, and was widely reported throughout Europe. Contemporary accounts connected the comet's appearance with the succession crisis in England.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{hypothesis}} of LDR is in contradiction to some embryological studies on birds which show that, from five developmental sites, the digits that develop are the three middle digits (II, III, IV). This inconsistency has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> debate for almost 200 years, and {{has been used by}} Alan Feduccia to support the controversial hypothesis that birds are descended not from theropods but from some other group of archosaurs which had lost the first and fifth digits. To explain the discrepancy between morphological and embryological data in the context of bird origins, an alternative scenario to LDR was developed by Tony Thulborn and Tim Hamley in 1982. In this scenario, the digits I and V of theropods were reduced in the process of Bilateral Digit Reduction (BDR), with the remaining digits developing to resemble the former digits I-III. Limusaurus was initially considered as evidence for the BDR hypothesis due to it - and other ceratosaurians - having a reduced first digit, with researchers hypothesizing that a similar pattern of reduction occurred among the tetanurans (the sister group of the ceratosaurians).|$|E
5|$|The exact {{location}} of the Acra, critical to understanding Hellenistic Jerusalem, had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> lengthy discussions. Historians and archaeologists had proposed various sites around Jerusalem, relying mainly on conclusions drawn from literary evidence. This approach began {{to change in the}} light of excavations which commenced in the late 1960s. New discoveries had prompted reassessments of the ancient literary sources, Jerusalem's geography and previously discovered artifacts. Yoram Tsafrir had interpreted a masonry joint in the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount platform as a clue to the Acra's possible position. During Benjamin Mazar's 1968 and 1978 excavations adjacent to the south wall of the Mount, features were uncovered which may have been connected with the Acra, including barrack-like rooms and a huge cistern. In November 2015 the Israel Antiquities Authority announced the likely discovery of the Acra in a different location, south-west of the Temple Mount and north-west of the City of David.|$|E
