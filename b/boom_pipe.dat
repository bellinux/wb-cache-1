5|$|Jing ping {{bands are}} made up of a boumboum (<b>boom</b> <b>pipe),</b> syak or gwaj (scraper-rattle), tambal or tanbou (tambourine) and accordion. The double bass and banjo are also {{sometimes}} used. Bamboo flutes led the jing ping ensembles before the 1940s, when accordions were introduced. The Dominican flute tradition declined as a result, despite their additional use in serenades, until being revived after the National Independence Competitions.|$|E
25|$|Montserrat is {{also home}} to a string band folk {{tradition}} that provides accompaniment to many kinds of songs and dances. These generally include the ukulele (yokolee, imported from Hawaiian music), guitar, triangle, the bass <b>boom</b> <b>pipe,</b> shak-shak, gradge and fife. String bands traditionally performed for weddings; this tradition declined with the rise of stereos and recorded music, as well as the spread of jazz bands, but was revived in the 1970s. String bands now also play at hotels and nightclubs.|$|E

50|$|The K-36s {{were used}} {{primarily}} as freight locomotives out of Alamosa to Durango, and to Farmington, New Mexico, {{as well as}} out of Salida to Gunnison (over Marshall Pass) until 1955 and to Monarch on the Monarch Branch until 1956. They were built with special valves to allow brake control between locomotives while double-heading, and were commonly found between Alamosa and Chama, New Mexico. They were heavily used during the <b>pipe</b> <b>boom</b> in Farmington, and hauled long freight trains between Alamosa and Farmington.|$|R
5000|$|R-14 — under acting {{command of}} Lieutenant Alexander Dean Douglas - {{ran out of}} usable fuel and lost radio {{communications}} in May 1921 while on a surface search mission for the seagoing tug [...] about [...] southeast of the island of Hawaii. Since the submarine's electric motors {{did not have enough}} battery power to propel her to Hawaii, the ship's engineering officer Roy Trent Gallemore came up with a novel solution to their problem. Lieutenant Gallemore decided they could try to sail the boat to the port of Hilo, Hawaii. He therefore ordered a foresail made of eight hammocks hung from a top <b>boom</b> made of <b>pipe</b> bunk frames lashed firmly together, all tied to the vertical kingpost of the torpedo loading crane forward of the submarine's superstructure. Seeing that this gave R-14 a speed of about 1 kn, as well as rudder control, he ordered a mainsail made of six blankets, hung from the sturdy radio mast (top sail in photo). This added [...]5 kn to the speed. He then ordered a mizzen made of eight blankets hung from another top boom made of bunk frames, all tied to the vertically placed boom of the torpedo loading crane. This sail added another [...]5 kn. Around 12:30 pm on 12 May, Gallemore was able to begin charging the boat's batteries. [...] After 64 hours under sail at slightly varying speeds, R-14 entered Hilo Harbor under battery propulsion on the morning of 15 May 1921. Douglas received a letter of commendation for the crew's innovative actions from his Submarine Division Commander, CDR Chester W. Nimitz, USN.|$|R
50|$|After {{the dome}} on each tank was finished, miners would descend {{into the central}} shaft and begin {{removing}} the remaining rock {{between them and the}} dome. As the rock was mined, it would fall down the shaft and into a hopper which permitted passage of rock sizes suitable to be carried by the conveyor belts below. Then, a jaw crusher would reduce the rock down to 10-inch diameter pieces for disposal. After enough space was cleared, workers constructed a six-foot catwalk around the circumference and suspended from cables anchored in the dome. These walks carried not only miners, but air lines, water lines, hand tools, and other items.  Miners would lower themselves by rope, insert dynamite into the rock wall, raise the catwalk, and then detonate the explosives.  As the excavation went deeper, picks, shovels, and crowbars were used to scale down the loose rock and bring the wall to a sufficient depth behind the excavation line.  This permitted effective application of approximately six inches of gunite (a mixture of cement, sand, and water) to line the basalt rock.  They then coated the gunite with a layer of natural red dirt to prevent bonding with concrete and allow future injection of pressurized grout.  This continued {{all the way down to}} the base.Upon completion of the excavation, workers erected a steel tower in the center to the full height of 250 feet.  The tower served to support concrete chutes, <b>pipes,</b> <b>booms,</b> and other equipment necessary to install the piping, concrete, and steel linings.  Workers then began to erect the steel liner and rebar incrementally so that they could pour concrete in stages. Concrete was poured continually and workers had to remove wooden shoring as concrete filled. They injected pressurized grout to pre-stress the concrete by filling void space between the concrete and the gunite. When finished, the tanks were tested by slowly filling them with water while laborers in boats physically checked the entire surface area of the steel liner.|$|R
