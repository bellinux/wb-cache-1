40|$|The {{planning}} {{culture in}} the Netherlands {{is based on the}} experience of building cities on very wet and soft soils. The design of Dutch polder cities was from early on a balance between land and water: <b>building</b> <b>site</b> <b>preparation.</b> The relation between technological development and urban development can be ordered in six phases: natural (- 1000), defensive (1000 - 1500), offensive (1500 - 1800), early manipulative (1800 - 1890), manipulative (1890 - 1990) and adaptive manipulative water management (1990 -). Rotterdam is chosen to represent the heritage of the Dutch talent with regard to the design and construction of water and land into dynamic cities. This is important because awareness and knowledge about historical principles makes it possible to draw the line into the future. UrbanismArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|E
40|$|As global {{populations and}} affluence rise, there is {{increasing}} demand for energy, animal protein, and construction materials. In many cases, available resource pools are insufficient to meet growing market demands, resulting in increased prices and competition for limited resources. This study evaluates key construction resources needed to build different types and scales of Iowa swine production facilities. Two types of facilities — conventional confinement and hoop barn-based — within farrow-to-finish pig production systems scaled to produce either 5, 200 or 15, 600 market pigs annually are examined. Conventional confinement facilities are typical of pork industry practice in the United States and are characterized by individual gestation stalls and 1, 200 head grow-finish buildings with slatted concrete floors and liquid manure systems. The hoop barn-based alternative uses bedded group pens in hoop barns for gestation and finishing. Five building materials: concrete, steel, lumber, thermoplastics, insulation, as well as crushed rock and diesel fuel used for <b>building</b> <b>site</b> <b>preparation</b> are considered. Land surface area required for buildings and pig production infrastructure are also compared. Relative market costs of newly constructed swine facilities are compared under several material price scenarios. Using hoop barns for grow-finish and gestation results in lower construction costs. Increasing the scale of pig production results in lower construction costs per pig space, however the construction costs per pig space for a 5, 200 head hoop barn-based complex {{is less than the}} construction costs per pig space for a 15, 600 head conventional confinement system. In terms of construction resource use and cost, hoop barns for swine are a viable alternative that are less dependent on the scale of production than conventional confinement facilities...|$|E
50|$|While {{construction}} {{was scheduled to}} begin in September 2005, the project was delayed by disputes with unions and the city.

50|$|The museum {{plans to}} {{construct}} a major new <b>building</b> on the <b>site</b> of the historic Tredegar Iron Works in downtown Richmond. The new building will feature more than 7,000 square feet of new gallery space for permanent and changing exhibitions of items from the museum’s renowned collections of Civil War artifacts, {{as well as an}} “immersion theater” highlighting Richmond’s role in the war. The 8.9 acre site also will feature a new outdoor exhibit, living history demonstrations, and a new Family Resource Center, to be located in the historic Administration <b>Building.</b> Groundbreaking and <b>site</b> <b>preparation</b> for the outdoor exhibit will take place in early 2015. Those projects, which are scheduled to take six months, also will include a reconfiguration of the site’s landscaping, repair of the historic canal wall and leveling of the grounds on the site’s upper level. The exhibit galleries at Historic Tredegar will remain open to the public throughout the outdoor construction, including the “In the Cause of Liberty” exhibit in the historic Foundry Building, and the Richmond National Battlefield Park Visitor Center, located in the historic Pattern Building. Groundbreaking and construction for the new building is tentatively scheduled to begin in late 2015 and complete by early 2017.|$|R
40|$|Wind {{turbines}} need obstacle warning aids to {{help the}} crew of airplanes, helicopters and ships to avoid collisions with the turbines. So far, the organizations performing the logistics of applying for <b>building</b> permits, <b>site</b> <b>preparation</b> and erection of wind turbines have generally handled each such activity as an isolated event. Thus, obstacle warning lights or markings have been applied as seen fit for the particular wind turbine or group of turbines. Obstacle markings have to be visible for aviators and seamen, this is obvious, but may be an annoyance to the public dwelling in the neighbourhood. This will put demands on the functioning and intensity of the system. For example: an unsynchronized blinking of light may have an adverse effect on the public acceptance of a wind farm. Two international organisations, ICAO 1 and IALA 2 work with recommendations for marking of wind turbines. ICAO {{is currently working on}} producing requirements specifically for marking and lighting wind turbines but have not yet completed these deliberations. The ICAO requirements for marking and lighting obstacles apply to all obstacles including wind turbines at present. But, there is still not a unifying agreement on the aviation warning marking lights. From a few meetings in Sweden on this topic it appears that the present sea markings, for fixed obstacles, will be accepted in their present IALA forms without modifications. Participants/Presentations A total of eight participants attended this meeting with representatives from Denmark, Ireland and Sweden.

40|$|Mercury (Hg) is {{an element}} of major concern in boreal {{freshwater}} ecosystems, due to high concentrations of Hg in fish. Forestry operations have been reported to increase the concentrations and loads of Hg to surface waters. In this thesis a series of catchment-scale experiments were used to determine forestry effects on total mercury (THg) and methyl mercury (MeHg) runoff concentrations caused by stump harvest, <b>site</b> <b>preparation</b> and antecedent logging. The stump harvest did not increase Hg concentrations in runoff relative to traditional <b>site</b> <b>preparation</b> in either of the stump harvest studies. The lack of treatment effects caused by stump harvest and <b>site</b> <b>preparation</b> in one of the stump harvest studies focused attention on the antecedent logging. The question of whether the logging was of major importance when compared with the subsequent soil disturbance caused by <b>site</b> <b>preparation</b> was further investigated in the Balsjö catchment study.

40|$|Prior {{to human}} {{missions}} to Mars, infrastructures on Mars that support human survival must be prepared. Robotic teams {{can assist in}} these advance preparations {{in a number of}} ways. This paper addresses one of these advance robotic team tasks { the <b>site</b> <b>preparation</b> task { by proposing a control structure that allows robot teams to cooperatively solve this aspect of infrastructure preparation.

40|$|This {{research}} will compare the demolition {{policies and practices}} of two shrinking cities within one metropolitan statistical area—Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Camden, New Jersey. Both cities have experienced major population losses due to deindustrialization and outmigration, and despite their physical proximity, the current states of the two cities are vastly different, with Philadelphia having somewhat stabilized and showing recent upticks in population, while Camden continues to struggle. Both cities have an abundance of abandoned buildings, where demolition is not uncommon. This research, therefore, aims to understand how each cities’ demolition and vacancy policies have affected the current landscape, spatially, socially, economically, and how prominent, if at all, a “smart decline”-oriented framework {{has been in the}} implementation of such planning tools. In so doing, the two research questions to be answered are: one, where does demolition occur—within what social, economic, and spatial contexts, using primarily GIS analysis; and two, to what extent do demolitions happen there, using regression analysis? The data analyses will be restricted to one 5 -year time period, from 2008 - 2012, to correspond to the U. S. Census’ American Community Survey. The aim of answering the questions is central to understanding how actual demolition work and policy discourse stack up against each other, even within this short timeframe. The hope is that officials, researchers, and other scholars will see the importance of knowing both the short- and long-term impacts of demolition in shrinking cities, and how policies have shaped demolition practices, or how policies should be reworked to better reflect a city’s goals. Camden suffers from mismanagement on the municipal, county, and state levels, which is reflected in both the GIS and regression analyses. Despite the optimistic rhetoric of recent policies, it appears that any demolition strategy fall to the wayside when funds are extremely limited and irregular, and when the city must respond to a great number of imminently dangerous buildings. Philadelphia, on the other, having fully addressed shrinkage, appears to have taken a two-pronged demolition strategy, which aims to address both public safety (imminently dangerous <b>buildings)</b> and <b>site</b> <b>preparation</b> and assemblage for future development...|$|R
