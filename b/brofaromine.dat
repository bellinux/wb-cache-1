50|$|<b>Brofaromine</b> (proposed {{brand name}} Consonar) is a {{reversible}} inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA) discovered by Ciba-Geigy. The compound was primarily researched {{in the treatment}} of depression and anxiety but its development was dropped before it was brought to market.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brofaromine</b> also {{acts as a}} {{serotonin}} reuptake inhibitor, and its dual pharmacologic effects offered {{promise in}} the treatment of a wide spectrum of depressed patients while producing less severe anticholinergic side effects in comparison with older standard drugs like the tricyclic antidepressants.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brofaromine</b> is a {{reversible}} inhibitor of {{monoamine oxidase}} A (RIMA, {{a type of}} monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI)) and acts on epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine (noradrenaline), serotonin, and dopamine. Unlike standard MAOIs, possible side effects do not include cardiovascular complications (hypertension) with encephalopathy, liver toxicity or hyperthermia.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>brofaromine,</b> a {{reversible}} inhibitor of MAO-A, on the extracellular content of serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) and 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA) {{have been studied}} in two regions of the rat brain (midbrain raphe nuclei and frontal cortex). In both areas, locally infused <b>brofaromine</b> induced dose-dependent increases of 5 -HT which were more marked in the raphe nuclei. <b>Brofaromine</b> increased extracellular 5 -HT more markedly than clorgyline, suggesting that other factors (i. e. inhibition of 5 -HT uptake) {{may be involved in}} its local effects. Systemic (3 mg/kg, s. c.) <b>brofaromine</b> did not modify extracellular 5 -HT in any brain area examined. In contrast, the concurrent administration of <b>brofaromine</b> and deprenyl led to significant changes in the concentration of 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA in the brain extracellular space. The results are discussed in relation to the role of MAO-A in the control of 5 -HT output. Peer reviewe...|$|E

C. 1. 4. 3. 4.), on 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) and 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA) output in rat frontal cortex. <b>Brofaromine</b> significantly increased the 5 -HT output to about 200...|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} the effects of two monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors with different mechanisms of action [...] phenelzine and <b>brofaromine</b> [...] on peripheral serotonergic (5 -hydroxytryptamine [5 -HT]) measures, sensitive to the inhibition of MAO-A (intra- and extracellular 5 -HT and related metabolites in blood). Both drugs increased the concentration of 5 -HT in platelet-free plasma (254 %, p less than 0. 001) in patients with depressive illness (DSM-III-R) after 6 weeks of daily treatment. Platelet 5 -HT was also increased significantly in both drug treatment groups but more marked in the patient group treated with phenelzine. The acid/amine ratio at 6 weeks was 30 % of pretreatment values (p less than 0. 000) and individual variability correlated significantly with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Plasma 5 -HT increased more markedly in responders than in nonresponders and a significant inverse relationship surfaced between plasma 5 -HT and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The results support other reports of comparable antidepressant efficacy for <b>brofaromine</b> and phenelzine, both inhibitors of MAO-A in humans. The consistent relationship we found between the biochemical and clinical changes again suggests and supports a key role of 5 -HT in the antidepressant effect of these MAO inhibitors.

40|$|Based on {{experimental}} evidence postulating {{a link between}} the incidence of extrapyramidal motor symptoms (EPMS) under neuroleptic treatment and the inhibitory effects of neuroleptics on the mitochondrial respiratory chain (especially complex I), {{this study was designed to}} investigate possible effects of antidepressants on mitochondrial electron transport. As EPMS are known to occur under antidepressive treatment, it seemed plausible that certain antidepressants might exert inhibitory effects on mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes similar to those recorded for neuroleptic therapy. The present study investigated in-vitro effects of amitriptyline, nortriptyline, fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, <b>brofaromine,</b> and venlafaxine on respiratory chain complexes SDH (succinate dehydrogenase), complex I/III, and complex II/III in post-mortal homogenates of human hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of an individual free from neurological and psychiatric conditions. The objective was to investigate which antidepressive agent showed the strongest inhibitory potency and whether the two brain regions under investigation differed regarding their susceptibility to these inhibitory effects. The experiments were conducted in two steps: An initial screening test exploring effects of the antidepressants at a high concentration of 1 mM served to identify those substances that caused an inhibition of enzyme activity of more than 20 %. In a second step, only these substances were used for studying dose dependency. All experiments were conducted in duplicate in four to eight separate experiments. The results show that none of the antidepressants caused a considerable inhibition of SDH-activity in the brain regions investigated (< 20 % inhibition). At 1 mM concentration, complex I/III was shown to be inhibited significantly, but to different extents by all antidepressants tested (except for venlafaxine and citalopram in prefrontal cortex, and citalopram in hippocampus). The most potent inhibitors were <b>brofaromine,</b> fluoxetine and nortriptyline with similar effects on both brain areas studied (27 %- 40 % inhibition). The strongest effects of all antidepressants except venlafaxine were to be seen for complex II/III in both brain areas. At a concentration of 1 mM, <b>brofaromine,</b> fluoxetine, nortriptyline and amitriptyline caused an inhibition of complex II/III activity of 45 %- 59 %. The effects on complex I/III and on complex II/III were found to be dose-dependent for all antidepressants investigated. In prefrontal cortex, <b>brofaromine</b> and nortriptyline displayed very similar dose-response-curves for complex II/III with weak inhibitory effects in a range of concentrations between 25 µM and 250 µM. The maximum inhibition of complex II/III activity amounted to 58 - 82 % and was reached at concentrations  1 mM. Amitriptyline, the parent compound of nortriptyline, effected a slight but significant activation of complex II/III in prefrontal cortex at a concentration of 50 - 100 µM. However, at a concentration of 500 - 750 µM, there was a rapid decline of enzyme activity with a maximum inhibition of almost 80 % at a concentration of 2 - 3 mM. In contrast, in hippocampal homogenates, amitriptyline displayed inhibitory effects at the whole range of concentrations tested. This might explain the difference in IC 50 -values found for amitriptyline in the two brain areas (prefrontal cortex: 1. 21 mM; hippocampus: 0. 81 mM). Fluoxetine and <b>brofaromine</b> revealed themselves to be the most potent inhibitors of complex II/III of all antidepressants tested. IC 50 -values for <b>brofaromine</b> were similar in both brain areas (prefrontal cortex: 0. 74 mM; hippocampus: 0. 85 mM). For fluoxetine, there were, however, differences in IC 50 -values between brain areas with a greater susceptibility of complex II/III in hippocampal homogenates (IC 50 = 0. 59 mM versus IC 50 = 1. 13 mM in prefrontal cortex). The present study conducted on human brain homogenates shows that in-vitro, contrary to neuroleptic agents, antidepressants exert their inhibitory effects on complex II/III rather than complex I/III of the respiratory chain. However, as results from in-vitro studies cannot be directly transferred to conditions in-vivo and as the human brain specimens investigated were drawn from a single individual, further research is needed. Also, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of antidepressants on respiratory chain enzymes have to be investigated. As a contribution to a field of research of great clinical impact, the results of the present work might provide an impetus to further studies...|$|E
40|$|Differences between {{responders}} and non-responders to {{drug therapy}} were investigated in social phobia. Two previously published studies were pooled to obtain data of 30 {{patients who were}} treated for 12 weeks with <b>brofaromine</b> or fluvoxamine. Four criterion variables were used to divide patients in responders and non-responders. Depending on the criterion variable up to 72 % of the patients were regarded as responders. Non-responders differed from responders in {{that they had a}} higher heart rate and a higher blood pressure. They were also characterised by higher scores on several psychometric scales, indicative of illness severity...|$|E
40|$|Social anxiety {{disorder}} (SAD) is a marked and persistent fear of doing almost everything {{in front of}} people due to concerns about being judge by others. An up-to-date review is needed in order to reach a practical judgement of all psychopharmacological data. Case reports, open and double-blind trials with SAD were described and commented upon from a clinical point of view. The MEDLINE system was searched from 1975 to 2001. The references from the selected papers were also used as a source. MAOIs (fenelzine, tranylcypromine), reversible monoamino oxidase-A inhibitors (moclobemide, <b>brofaromine),</b> SSRIs (paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine) and some other antidepressants (venlafaxine, nefazodone) have proven effective in several studies with various methodologies. The MAOIs have more serious adverse effects and the SSRIs have the best tolerance. SSRIs are efficacious and the first choice of treatment...|$|E
40|$|Women with bulimia nervosa {{undergoing}} {{treatment with}} the reversible monoamine oxidase type A inhibitor, <b>brofaromine,</b> were rated for mood and eating behaviour and their plasma and urine were assessed for phenylacetic acid (unconjugated and total) and unconjugated phenylethylamine {{prior to and}} after four weeks of drug treatment. Changes in plasma unconjugated phenylacetic acid concentrations were significantly and negatively correlated with the corresponding changes in Hamilton Depression scores but not with eating behavior measures. There were no significant correlations between changes in phenylethylamine levels and changes in rating scores. Patients diagnosed as suffering concurrently from severe depression (Hamilton Depression score of 17 or higher) had lower plasma and urinary phenylacetic acid levels than did those whose depression was not severe (Hamilton score less than 17). Phenylethylamine concentrations were not different between the severely and mildly depressed subgroups. The results confirm earlier studies {{on the relationship between}} phenylacetic acid and depression while showing that a similar relationship does not pertain to phenylacetic acid and eating behavior in bulimia nervosa...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{biological}} predictors of treatment response in panic disorder (PD). In the present study heart rate, blood pressure, plasma cortisol and plasma MHPG were investigated at baseline {{in a sample of}} 44 PD patients as possible predictors for nonresponse to treatment. We used a strict definition of nonresponse to find patients who did not respond at all after 12 weeks of treatment with <b>brofaromine</b> or fluvoxamine. Patients were considered nonresponders when they fulfilled two criteria: they did not show a 50 % reduction of agoraphobic avoidance and they still experienced panic attacks at endpoint. The variables that differed significantly between the groups were used to predict nonresponse to drug therapy. Using this strict definition of nonresponse, 15 patients (32. 6 %) were considered nonresponders. These patients were characterised by a higher plasma MHPG concentration and a higher heart rate at baseline. These variables were subsequently used to predict nonresponse...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the MAO (monoamine oxidase) -B {{inhibitor}} deprenyl (DPR, selegiline) protects some cell types against oxidative stress. By decreasing H 2 O 2 production, MAO-A inhibitors could also reduce oxidative stress. This study reports the effect of the MAO-A inhibitors, pirlindole (PIR), dehydropirlindole (DHP), <b>brofaromine</b> (BRO) and moclobemide (MCL) on primary-cultured brain cells exposed to iron-mediated toxicity. A comparison with trolox (TRO), a hydrosoluble vitamin-E analogue that protects against such an induced stress, was performed. Rat hippocampal or cortical cultured cells were exposed either to 2 [*]μM FeSO 4 alone or in the presence of PIR, DHP, BRO, DPR, MCL or TRO. Cell survival (lactate-dehydrogenase measurements, 16 [*]h incubation), intracellular peroxide production (DCF-fluorescence, 1 [*]h incubation), lipoperoxidation (TBARS-fluorescence, 6 [*]h incubation) and mitochondrial function (MTT-test, 16 [*]h incubation) were assessed. PIR, DHP and TRO significantly protected cultures (P< 0. 05) against Fe 2 +-induced toxicity in a concentration-dependent manner. The EC 50 s of these compounds were 6, 12 and 19 [*]μM, respectively, in hippocampal cells. For cortical cell cultures incubated in the presence of iron and PIR or DHP, EC 50 s were 5 and 6 [*]μM respectively. All Hill coefficients were close to unity. BRO, MCL and DPR were not protective in any type of culture. The IC 50 s for the inhibition of MAO-A were 2, 2 and 0. 2 [*]μM for PIR, DHP and BRO, respectively. PIR, DHP and TRO, but not DPR, induced a significant decrease in both intracellular peroxide production and lipoperoxidation. They also improved mitochondrial function. These experiments show that PIR and DHP can protect hippocampal and cortical neurons against oxidative stress at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. This protective effect seems unrelated to inhibition of MAO-A, but possibly involves free radical scavenging...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that pirlindole and dehydropirlindole, two monoamine oxidase type-A inhibitors, protect cultured brain cells against iron-induced toxicity through a mechanism unrelated to monoamine oxidase type-A inhibition. The {{current study was}} performed to test whether the protective effect of pirlindole and dehydropirlindole could be extended to a nitric oxide (NO) -induced insult. A comparison with other monoamine oxidase inhibitors (<b>brofaromine,</b> moclobemide and deprenyl) and with trolox was made. In a first series of experiments, rat hippocampal or cortical cultured cells were exposed to a drug for 3 h, then 5 muM sodium nitroprusside, a NO donor, was added and the incubation was continued for 16 h. Cell survival assessment showed that pirlindole, dehydropirlindole and trolox significantly protected cultures against NO-induced toxicity in a concentration-dependent manner with respective EC 50 's of 7, 3 and 17 muM. Similarly, pirlindole, dehydropirlindole or trolox, at a concentration of 50 muM, significantly decreased both intracellular peroxide production and lipoperoxidation. Other drugs were ineffective. In a post-hoc treatment protocol (3 - or 6 -h pre-incubation {{in the presence of}} sodium nitroprusside, then addition of one of the above mentioned compounds), only pirlindole and dehydropirlindole significantly improved cell survival in a concentration-dependent manner with respective EC 50 'S of 9 and 4 muM. The maximal protection in terms of cell survival was 90 % and 78 % after 3 and 6 h, respectively. They also reduced the production of both lipoperoxides and endoperoxides. Our results show that pirlindole and dehydropirlindole protect neurons against NO-induced toxicity at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Moreover, their protective effect is still apparent when they are applied after the start of the insult. Therefore, our preclinical study suggests a new strategy that may be efficient to reduce NO-induced damage in the central nervous system. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.
