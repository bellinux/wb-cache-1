40|$|SummaryDuring the {{assembly}} of the musculoskeletal system, <b>bone</b> <b>ridges</b> provide a stable anchoring point and stress dissipation for the attachment of muscles via tendons to the skeleton. In this study, we investigate {{the development of the}} deltoid tuberosity as a model for <b>bone</b> <b>ridge</b> formation. We show that the deltoid tuberosity develops through endochondral ossification in a two-phase process: initiation is regulated by a signal from the tendons, whereas the subsequent growth phase is muscle dependent. We then show that the transcription factor scleraxis (SCX) regulates Bmp 4 in tendon cells at their insertion site. The inhibition of deltoid tuberosity formation and several other <b>bone</b> <b>ridges</b> in embryos in which Bmp 4 expression was blocked specifically in Scx-expressing cells implicates BMP 4 as a key mediator of tendon effects on <b>bone</b> <b>ridge</b> formation. This study establishes a mechanistic basis for tendon-skeleton regulatory interactions during musculoskeletal assembly and bone secondary patterning...|$|R

40|$|Stresses {{transmitted}} on the alveolar <b>bone</b> <b>ridge</b> by lined conventional complete mandibular dentures can {{decrease the}} bone absorption level. The {{aim of this}} in vitro study was to evaluate the stresses induced on the alveolar <b>bone</b> <b>ridge</b> of lined conventional complete mandibular dentures by using photoelastic analysis. One maxillary and three mandibular conventional dentures were developed for the following treatments: 1 - Unlined denture (control), 2 - Denture lined with resin-based material, and 3 - Denture lined with silicone-based material. The photoelastic analysis took place with the dentures {{in the position of}} maximum intercuspation, and the mandibular photoelastic models were axially loaded with 10 kgf (98 N). Unlined denture (control) presented stresses along the model, especially on the anterior and left lateral sides with less stresses on the right side. On the left lateral side, the denture base lined with resin-based material demonstrated similar stresses to that of the control; however, lower stresses occurred in the premolar and retromolar regions. Denture bases lined with silicone-based material showed decreased fringe orders and homogeneous distribution of induced stresses. Both lined dentures exhibited lower stresses when compared to unlined dentures. Silicone-based material provided a more homogeneous distribution of stresses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|Among the Hidatsa, {{typical of}} Great Plains farmers, fields were cleared by burning which also fertilized the soil. The three {{implements}} used by Indian farmers were the digging stick, hoe, and rake. The digging stick was a sharpened and fire-hardened stick, {{three or more}} feet long, {{that was used to}} loosen soil, uproot weeds, and make planting holes. The hoe was made from a buffalo or elk shoulder <b>blade</b> <b>bone,</b> or scapula, lashed to a wooden handle. The rake was made from wood or an antler. Some Indian women preferred the bone hoe even after the iron hoe was introduced by European traders and settlers.|$|R

30|$|All {{these authors}} have {{proposed}} {{the same approach}} about the flap: paracrestal incision. In order to preserve the blood supply, it is of fundamental importance that the least number possible of the vessels of the soft tissue be damaged. Based on this concept, we believe that changing the flap design can obtain {{the improvement of the}} healing of the wound. The sandwich osteotomy with the tunnel technique meets these requests. This is because the incisions were only two and vertical in the buccal side. Another advantage, especially with respect to implants, is that vascularisation is maintained in the <b>bone</b> <b>ridge</b> throughout augmentation intervention; thus, the interface at the implant shoulder in terms of hard-to-soft tissue to implant interface is kept as true to the original as possible.|$|R
40|$|This review shows {{a summary}} of our {{previous}} studies concerning how to augment alveolar <b>bone</b> <b>ridge</b> by minimum intervention using autologous alveolar bone derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and scaffolds. We successfully collected MSC from alveolar bone marrow using newly developed puncture needle, and expanded them in vitro. We have developed serum free culture medium and found several new initial osteogenic markers and new resistance factors for external stimuli on MSC. Furthermore, we found several factor controlling MSC migration and osteogenic differentiation. We combined MSC with calcium phosphate scaffold and transplanted them into canine edentulous model and successfully observed osseointegration between augmented bone and implant. We {{are going to start}} alveolar bone augmentation treatment using alveolar bone marrow MSC/scaffold utilizing above mentioned techniques in the near future...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} computer-aided {{methods that}} allocate a dental implant and suggest its size, during the pre-operative planning stage, in conformance with introduced optimization criteria and established clinical requirements. Based on computed tomography {{data of the}} jaw and prosthesis anatomy, single tooth cases are planned for the best-suited implant insertion at a user-defined region. An optimum implantation axis line is produced and cylindrical implants of various candidate sizes are then automatically positioned, while their occlusal end is leveled to <b>bone</b> <b>ridge,</b> and evaluated. Radial safety margins are used {{for the assessment of}} the implant safety distance from neighboring anatomical structures and bone quantity and quality are estimated and taken into consideration. A case study demonstrates the concept and allows for its discussion. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|When {{patients}} with a narrow alveolar <b>bone</b> <b>ridge</b> are treated with oral implants, a dehiscence can occur. The lack of bony support at the buccal or lingual side of the implant may present an unfavourable situation from a biomechanical point of view. The hypothesis {{as to whether the}} presence of dehiscence leads to an increased risk of marginal bone overload was tested by means of the finite element method. Three different situations for a cylindrical oral implant, which was placed in a mandible, were modelled: i) no dehiscence, ii) a dehiscence at the buccal side and iii) dehiscences at the buccal and lingual sides. It was found that the presence of buccal and/or lingual dehiscences led to a marked increase in marginal bone strains at the mesial and distal sides of the implant, thus increasing the risk of bone tissue overload at these locations. Marginal bone strains at the buccal and/or lingual sides, however, did not increase. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Radicular cyst {{extension}} {{can result}} with significant alveolar ridge destruction. One of the therapy options after apical resection and cystectomy is to completely fill the alveolar <b>ridge</b> damage with <b>bone</b> synthetic substituent. The {{aim of this}} study was to present the advantage of ridge augmentation after apical resection and cystectomy. Case report and result: A female patient (age 46) with diagnosis of radicular cyst (10 mm) on the left first and second maxillary incisive. Apicoectomy and cystectomy were made with placing bone synthetic substituent in the alveolar ridge. After 4 months new aesthetic restorations were made. Conclusions: The reconstruction of jaw bone tissues and the procedure of <b>bone</b> <b>ridge</b> augmentation are necessary in the ordinary oral surgery interventions. When sufficient bone volume will compromise the final aesthetic restoration, then augmentation of the alveolar ridge is method of choice for most of the patients.

40|$|Sinus {{augmentation}} is {{a well-known}} approach to treating alveolar <b>bone</b> <b>ridge</b> atrophy in the posterior maxilla. The preparation of the lateral window is crucial. Its size, design, and position in the vestibular sinus wall may affect the intra- and postsurgical complication rates and affect the intrasurgical activity of both surgeons and assistants. The present paper describes a rational technique that also exploits the guided surgery approach for design and preparation of a lateral window for sinus augmentation, the Low Window Sinus Lift. To illustrate {{the use of this}} approach, a case is presented in which the 50 -year-old patient had the left maxillary first molar extracted, followed two months later by sinus augmentation and placement of three implants. One year after delivery of the definitive prosthesis, all three implants were successful, and the prosthesis was fully functional. Controlled studies should be undertaken to assess whether this technique provides significant advantages compared to other sinus augmentation approaches...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{discovered}} by Heidenborg in 1833. Godefroy Zumoffen made an excavation in 1893, finding an Aurignacian industry amongst large quantities of bones and flints. Henri Fleisch re-examined the material from Zumoffen's excavation and concluded {{that it was not}} solely Aurignacian but showed evidence of successive industries present as late as the Neolithic. Raoul Describes also excavated the site and found numerous tools made of bone including two harpoons which are now in the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory. Auguste Bergy also made a small excavation here and another sounding was made possibly in 1948 by J. Ewing who described the industry as [...] "transitional, Upper Paleolithic-to-Mesolithic". Dirk Albert Hooijer studied the fauna from the cave and found Dama and Capra to have been predominant.

40|$|Theses {{is focused}} on {{analysis}} of early bronze age burial sites excavated during the rescue excavation caused by highway construction around the town of Kolín. Two burial sites {{in a range of}} 70 and 13 burials were examined. Information from both of these burial sites were analyzed on the basis of fieldwork research from years 2008 - 2009. The larger burial site was ascribed to late Únětice Culture by material finds, the smaller burial site was recognized as early Únětice Culture. Burial rite had a same standard characteristic as in other Únětice regions. Local differences in burial rite dwelled in a specific finds, which are not common in an eastern part of Middle Bohemia (amber, animal <b>blade</b> <b>bone).</b> Secondary burial disturbances was traced in all kind of burials of men, women and children.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the potential impact}} of different visualisation methods of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) on the accuracy of linear measurements of calcified structures, and assessed their interchangeability. High resolution (0. 125 mm voxel) CBCT scans were obtained from eight cadaveric heads. The distance between the alveolar <b>bone</b> <b>ridge</b> and the incisal edge was determined for all mandibular incisors and canines, both anatomically and with measurements based on the following five CBCT visualisation methods: isosurface, direct volume rendering, multiplanar reformatting (MPR), maximum intensity projection of the volume of interest (VOIMIP), and average intensity projection of the volume of interest (VOIAvIP). All radiological methods were tested for repeatability and compared with anatomical results for accuracy, and limits of agreement were established. Interchangeability was evaluated by reviewing disparities between the methods and disclosing deterministic differences. Fine intra- and inter-observer repeatability was asserted for all visualisation methods (intraclass correlation coefficient ≤ 0. 81). Measurements were most accurate when performed on MPR images and performed most disappointingly on isosurface-based images. Direct volume rendering, VOIMIP and VOIAvIP achieved acceptable results. It can be concluded that visualisation methods influence the accuracy of CBCT measurements. The isosurface viewing method is not recommended, and multiplanar reformatted images should be favoured for linear measurements of calcified structures...|$|R
