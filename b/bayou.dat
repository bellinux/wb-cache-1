5|$|Houston {{has four}} major bayous {{passing through the}} city that accept water from the {{extensive}} drainage system. Buffalo <b>Bayou</b> runs through downtown and the Houston Ship Channel, and has three tributaries: White Oak <b>Bayou,</b> which runs through the HoustonHeights community northwest of Downtown and then towards Downtown; Brays <b>Bayou,</b> which runs along the Texas Medical Center; and Sims <b>Bayou,</b> which runs through the south of Houston and downtown Houston. The ship channel continues past Galveston {{and then into the}} Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Theater District is a 17-block area in {{the center}} of {{downtown}} Houston that is home to the <b>Bayou</b> Place entertainment complex, restaurants, movies, plazas, and parks. <b>Bayou</b> Place is a large multilevel building containing full-service restaurants, bars, live music, billiards, and Sundance Cinema. The <b>Bayou</b> Music Center stages live concerts, stage plays, and stand-up comedy.|$|E
5|$|The {{underground}} tunnel system, which connects most large office buildings in downtown Houston, was submerged, as were many streets and parking garages adjacent to Buffalo <b>Bayou.</b> In the Houston Theater District, also near Buffalo <b>Bayou</b> {{in the northern}} part of downtown, the Houston Ballet, Houston Symphony, Houston Grand Opera, and Alley Theater lost millions of dollars' worth of costumes, musical instruments, sheet music, archives, props, and other artifacts.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} has privately owned apartment complexes on campus: Cullen Oaks, <b>Bayou</b> Oaks, and Cambridge Oaks.|$|E
5|$|Wilford Brimley as Uncle Douvee, Chance Boudreaux's {{uncle who}} lives {{deep in the}} <b>Bayou.</b> Chance and Natasha take shelter at his home as well as have him help during the film's final shoot out.|$|E
5|$|Another {{formation}} with tyrannosaur {{remains is}} the Lance Formation of Wyoming. This {{has been interpreted}} as a <b>bayou</b> environment similar to today's Gulf Coast. The fauna was very similar to Hell Creek, but with Struthiomimus replacing its relative Ornithomimus. The small ceratopsian Leptoceratops also lived in the area.|$|E
5|$|Houston {{was granted}} {{incorporation}} on June 5, 1837, with James S. Holman becoming its first mayor. In the same year, Houston became {{the county seat}} of Harrisburg County (now Harris County) and the temporary capital of the Republic of Texas. In 1840, the community established a chamber of commerce in part to promote shipping and waterborne business at the newly created port on Buffalo <b>Bayou.</b>|$|E
5|$|Inland {{from the}} bay, {{the towns of}} Harrisburg and Houston were both founded on the Buffalo <b>Bayou</b> by {{entrepreneurs}} from New York and competed as commercial centers, but neither was as significant as Galveston. Texas State Historical Association.Davenport (1843), p. 170. Throughout the 19th century these three cities developed increasing influence on the Bay Area communities, particularly as railroads were built through the region.|$|E
5|$|MS 465 {{continues}} to journey westward in Issaquena County, following the Yazoo River while surrounded by multiple smaller ponds. Next, the highway crosses over the Steele <b>Bayou,</b> and soon follows the Old Channel. The highway continues westward, crossing another bridge and passing nearby a cemetery. MS 465 intersects Levee Road, and then re-enters Warren County.|$|E
5|$|The deluge flooded 95,000automobiles and 73,000houses {{throughout}} Harris County. Tropical Storm Allison destroyed 2,744homes, leaving 30,000homeless with residential damages totaling to $1.76billion (2001USD, $2.05billion 2007USD). Residential neighborhoods {{inside and}} {{to the north of}} Interstate 610 were hardest hit. Additionally, five of the six <b>bayou</b> systems in downtown Houston were severely flooded. Four of them broke 100-year high-water records, causing excessive surface run-off.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} {{is the natural}} {{reservoir}} of the <b>Bayou</b> virus, {{the second most common}} cause of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the United States. Two other hantaviruses, Catacamas virus and Playa de Oro virus, occur in O.couesi in Honduras and western Mexico, respectively, but are not known to infect humans.|$|E
5|$|Years later, an {{interview}} with Henry Lee Loggins's son Mayor Jhonny B. Thomas revealed that Till was shot and tossed over the Black <b>Bayou</b> Bridge in Glendora, Mississippi, near the Tallahatchie River. The group drove back to Roy Bryant's home in Money, where they reportedly burned Emmett's clothes.|$|E
5|$|Across the state, the {{hurricane}} damaged 23,000homes and destroyed 985homes and 1,951mobile homes; private property damage {{was estimated at}} $1billion. The high winds destroyed large areas of sugar and soybean crops, estimated at $289million in damage. Strong winds also left at least 230,000people without electricity. During the storm's passage, upwelling occurred in the Atchafalaya Basin and <b>Bayou</b> Lafourche, killing 187million freshwater fish. Damage to the fishing industry was estimated at $266million. Overall, losses {{in the state of}} Louisiana reached approximately $1.56billion. A total of 17deaths occurred in Louisiana, 8directly and 9from indirect causes. At least 75injuries were reported.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{dominates the}} {{northern}} shore, where many plots of land are still {{owned by the}} descendants of early settlers. The largely abandoned historical communities of Rosita and West Portland are also located in this area. To the west, the Odem Bay extension is formed, and is fed by Rincon <b>Bayou</b> and a large complex of marsh formed by the Nueces River delta. Just south of the mouth, are {{the remains of the}} abandoned Nuecestown settlement, which is now included in the Corpus Christi city limits.|$|E
5|$|Although Hogg spent {{little time}} at the Varner {{plantation}} after <b>Bayou</b> Bend was constructed, she continued to purchase art and antique furniture on its behalf. In the 1950s, she restored the plantation, and each room was given a different theme from Texas history: colonial times, the Confederacy, Napoleonic times (1818), and the Mexican–American War. One room was dedicated to her father, and contained his desk and chair {{as well as his}} collection of walking sticks. She donated the property to the state, and it was dedicated as the Varner–Hogg Plantation State Historical Site in 1958, the 107th anniversary of Jim Hogg's birth.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this initial mishap, De Sotos first capture did not take long, as she and a bluejacket-crewed lugger took {{schooner}} Major Barbour off Isles Dernières, Louisiana on 28 January 1862. Cmdr. Walker's crew discovered 8 barrels of gunpowder and 198 cases of gunpowder, nitrates, sulfur, and percussion caps in the blockade runner. On 8 February, the steamer caught the small schooner Star out of <b>Bayou</b> Lafourche, taking her four-man crew prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Local {{television}} stations ran all-night {{coverage of the}} deluge from June 8 through the next day, including KHOU-TV 11, which was forced to transmit its broadcast to a satellite truck when floodwaters entered its production studio on the Allen Parkway near Studemont/Montrose, near downtown {{along the banks of}} Buffalo <b>Bayou.</b> By midnight on June 9 nearly every freeway and major road in the city was under several feet of water, forcing hundreds of motorists to abandon their vehicles for higher ground. Eighteen-wheeled trucks were filmed floating down major freeways and highways, swept along by floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|Many annual events {{celebrate}} the diverse cultures of Houston. The largest and longest-running is the annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, held over 20days from early to late March, {{and is the}} largest annual livestock show and rodeo in the world. Another large celebration is the annual night-time Houston Pride Parade, held {{at the end of}} June. Other annual events include the Houston Greek Festival, Art Car Parade, the Houston Auto Show, the Houston International Festival, and the <b>Bayou</b> City Art Festival, which is considered {{to be one of the}} top five art festivals in the United States.|$|E
5|$|On 24 February 1990, tugboats moved Texas from {{dry dock}} to a repair {{facility}} on Green's <b>Bayou</b> for further repairs. It {{was here that}} the wood deck was installed and four of the ten mounts of quad 40mm guns were installed. On 26 July, the ship was returned to her berth at San Jacinto where the final six mounts of 40mm guns were installed. Repairs complete, the ship officially reopened to the public on 8 September 1990. Since returning to her slip at San Jacinto, members of the ship's staff and volunteers have worked to restore the interior spaces.|$|E
5|$|Playa de Oro {{virus was}} {{identified}} as a new species in 2008 and is most closely related to <b>Bayou</b> virus, Catacamas virus, Muleshoe virus, and Black Creek Canal virus, found in other species of Oryzomys and Sigmodon. Catacamas virus is found in a different population of Oryzomys couesi, and the presence of different viruses in these two species has been used as an argument for classifying the two populations of the host as separate species.|$|E
5|$|Sherman's {{military}} {{record in}} 1862–63 was mixed. In December 1862, forces {{under his command}} suffered a severe repulse at the Battle of Chickasaw <b>Bayou,</b> just north of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Soon after, his XV Corps was ordered to join Maj. Gen. John A. McClernand in his successful assault on Arkansas Post, generally regarded as a politically motivated distraction from the effort to capture Vicksburg. Before the Vicksburg Campaign {{in the spring of}} 1863, Sherman expressed serious reservations about the wisdom of Grant's unorthodox strategy, but he went on to perform well in that campaign under Grant's supervision.|$|E
5|$|Syd Cain {{returned}} as art director and was involved searching for locations with Guy Hamilton in March 1972. Principal photography began on 13 October 1972 in the Irish <b>Bayou</b> in Louisiana for a boat chase scene. On 29 November production moved to Jamaica, which doubled for the fictional island San Monique, {{the home of}} antagonist Kananga. In December, production was divided between interiors in Pinewood Studios, while a separate unit also shot in Harlem.|$|E
5|$|The habitat {{includes}} {{various kinds}} of wetlands, such as lakes, marshes, and rivers. Oryzomys species swim well, are active during the night, and eat both plant and animal food. They build woven nests of vegetation. After a gestation period of 21 to 28days, about four young are born. Species of Oryzomys are infected by numerous parasites and carry at least three hantaviruses, one of which (<b>Bayou</b> virus) also infects humans. Two, maybe three, species have gone extinct {{over the last two}} centuries and at least one other is endangered, but the widespread marsh rice rat and O.couesi are not threatened.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} {{around the}} bay features {{a mix of}} swamps, beaches, industrial facilities, tourist attractions, and historic sites. The area's developing population is ethnically diverse with a growing international community. The communities host cultural events ranging from ballet and musical theater to fairs and rodeos. The bay itself supports a commercial fishing industry and features {{one of the highest}} concentrations of marinas in the nation. On land the area holds numerous historic sites such as the San Jacinto Monument, and many parks and nature preserves such as the Armand <b>Bayou</b> Nature Center.|$|E
5|$|The tourism {{industry}} attracts millions of visitors each year with attractions ranging from Space Center Houston {{to the bay}} itself. Ecotourism, in particular, is a growing sector with destinations such as the Armand <b>Bayou</b> Nature Center. Biotechnology, which already employs nearly 3000 workers in the area, is a smaller but growing industry in the area enabled {{in large part by}} JSC and the Texas Medical Center in Houston. Commercial fishing is one the older industries in the region and is still a significant economic sector.|$|E
5|$|The {{underground}} tunnel system, which connects most large office buildings in downtown Houston, was submerged, as were many streets and parking garages adjacent to Buffalo <b>Bayou.</b> At the Houston Theater District, also in downtown, the Houston Symphony, Houston Grand Opera, and Alley Theater lost {{millions of dollars}} of costumes, musical instruments, sheet music, archives and other artifacts. By midnight on June 9 nearly every freeway and major road in the city was under several feet of water, forcing hundreds of motorists to abandon their vehicles for higher ground.|$|E
5|$|To improve drainage, a levee was {{constructed}} in 1967, separating the lake from the Victoria Barge Canal, which runs along the bay's northern and eastern shores; cutting off several bayous from the lake. The canal begins north at an industrial plant outside Victoria and empties in San Antonio Bay in Seadrift. Hog <b>Bayou</b> runs along the western shore of Green Lake, through the Guadalupe Delta Wildlife Management Area to the south, before its confluence with Mission Lake.|$|E
5|$|A diverse {{collection}} of birds {{sustained by the}} water life, such as the black skimmer, brown pelican, great blue heron, egret, laughing gull, roseate spoonbill, tern, and the white ibis, {{can be found in}} the bay, especially near the mouth of Rincon <b>Bayou.</b> Local efforts by the Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries program have benefited bird populations by adding crushed oyster shells to the bay's small islands for improved nesting conditions, and the restoration of marsh near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase fish populations to satisfy the birds' dietary requirements. At the nearby Nueces Delta Preserve, countless birds have been observed, as well as bobcats, coyotes, feral hogs, mountain lions, rattlesnakes, Texas spiny lizards, western diamondbacks and white-tailed deer.|$|E
5|$|Another segment, Debussy's Clair de lune, was {{developed}} {{as part of}} the film's original program. After being completely animated, it was cut out of the final film to shorten its lengthy running time. The animation depicted two Great white herons flying through the Florida Everglades on a moonlit night. The sequence was later edited and re-scored for the Blue <b>Bayou</b> segment in Make Mine Music (1946). In 1992, a workprint of the original was discovered and Clair de Lune was restored, complete with the original soundtrack of Stokowski with the Philadelphia Orchestra. It was included as a bonus feature in The Fantasia Anthology DVD in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Chance leads Natasha to {{his uncle}} Douvee's (Wilford Brimley) house {{deep in the}} <b>bayou,</b> and enlists his help in {{defeating}} the men. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee lead the hunting party to a warehouse of old damaged Mardi Gras floats and statues, called Mardi Gras graveyard, and even kill off Fouchon's men one by one. Van Cleef is finally gunned down by Chance in a shootout. In the end only Fouchon is left, but he holds Chance at bay by taking Natasha hostage and stabbing Douvee in the chest with an arrow. Chance charges him, attacking with a flurry of blows, and then drops a grenade in his pants. Fouchon attempts to dismantle the grenade, but fails and gets incenerated in the explosion. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee now make {{their way out of}} the warehouse.|$|E
5|$|Every second, {{approximately}} 28 cubed {{meters of}} water {{flows into the}} bay. The exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Cedar <b>Bayou</b> and Aransas Pass. As {{a result of the}} seawater exchange, the bay's salinity is 15 parts per thousand, compared to the seawater average of 35 ppt. This discrepancy is brought about by the volume of fresh water that empties into the bay and its extensions, from Copano Creek, Mission River and Aransas River, forming the Mission-Aransas estuary. Fresh water flows also arrive from the impact of the Guadalupe River on San Antonio Bay. Combined, the fresh water influence is 60 to 70 percent of the system's volume, which is judged to be minimal.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Hogg {{purchased}} property near Round Top, {{hoping to}} move its historic building to <b>Bayou</b> Bend. When that plan proved impractical, she decided to restore it in place and temporarily moved to Round Top. After personally supervising {{the restoration of the}} Winedale Inn, a stagecoach inn near Round Top, Hogg donated the property to the University of Texas at Austin. Known as the Winedale Historical Center, it is used primarily as an outdoor museum and music center, and annually hosts Shakespeare at Winedale. In 1969, she restored her parents' house in Quitman; the town renamed it the Ima Hogg Museum in her honor. The museum holds items from the history of Wood County and northeast Texas. She later restored the home of her maternal grandfather and had it moved to the park.|$|E
5|$|In a troop {{movement}} that took all {{night on a}} makeshift raft, the Texian army crossed Buffalo <b>Bayou</b> at Lynchburg April 19 with 930 soldiers, leaving behind 255 others as guards or for reasons of illness. The idea had been floated of leaving the Twin Sisters behind as protection, but Neill was adamant that the cannons be taken into the battle. In an April 20 skirmish {{the day before the}} main battle Neill was severely wounded, and George Hockley took command of the heavy artillery. Estimates of the Mexican army troop strength {{on the day of the}} main battle range from 1,250 to 1,500.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Andrew Jackson's plea for volunteers {{to fight the}} British in the War of 1812, James and Rezin enlisted in the Louisiana militia in late 1814. The Bowie brothers arrived in New Orleans too late {{to participate in the}} fighting. After mustering out of the militia, Bowie settled in Rapides Parish, where he supported himself by sawing planks and lumber and floating them down the <b>bayou</b> for sale. In June 1819, he joined the Long Expedition, an effort to liberate Texas from Spanish rule. The group encountered little resistance and, after capturing Nacogdoches, declared Texas an independent republic. The extent of Bowie's participation is unclear, but he returned to Louisiana before the invasion was repelled by Spanish troops.|$|E
5|$|Maxie sends his henchmen after Danny. Shark {{and another}} gang member trap {{him in an}} alley. Danny knocks out one of his pursuers. Then Shark stabs Danny, but kills himself in the struggle. Ronnie then finds a profusely {{bleeding}} Danny and takes him to her house on a <b>bayou</b> to recover. She asks him to forget her sordid past and pretend to love her. Danny replies {{that it would not}} be difficult and kisses her. Maxie drives up, accompanied by Dummy (Jack Grinnage), a member of Danny's former gang. Maxie fatally shoots Ronnie. Dummy, who had been befriended by Danny, grapples with Maxie; the gun goes off, killing its owner.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} in New Orleans, Louisiana, was delayed following Hurricane Katrina {{because of the}} devastation caused by the storm {{and the collapse of}} the levees. Many of the exteriors were set to be shot in New Orleans, including a key sequence involving the Canal Street Ferry across the Mississippi River. After the city was reopened, the cast and crew returned to New Orleans to continue filming. Some scenes of the post-Katrina devastation were worked into the plot, including those in the Lower 9th Ward; additionally, evidence of Katrina's impact on the city was worked into the script.Deja Vu starts production in New Orleans|work= USA Today|date= February 2, 2006|accessdate=2008-10-19|quote= |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-02-02-deja-vu_x.htm}} The filming crew spent two weeks filming a scene at the Four Mile <b>Bayou</b> in Morgan City, Louisiana.|$|E
