50|$|In England, {{the usual}} {{division}} of labor is that a solicitor will obtain {{the facts of the}} case from the client and then <b>brief</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> (usually in writing). The barrister then researches and drafts the necessary court pleadings (which will be filed and served by the solicitor) and orally argues the case.|$|E
5000|$|In England and Wales, <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> {{delivered}} to <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> by <b>a</b> solicitor is usually tied with pink ribbon. Pink was traditionally the color {{associated with the}} defense, while white ribbons {{may have been used}} for the prosecution.|$|R
50|$|Owen {{was born}} in Holland Park, London, and was educated at Eton College and University College, Oxford. After <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> period as <b>a</b> <b>barrister,</b> he worked at The Daily Telegraph as a {{journalist}} from 1995 until 2001. In 2004, with Guy Walters, he edited The Voice of War, an anthology of World War II memoirs, diaries and letters.|$|R
50|$|These {{costs will}} include the {{situation}} in which a party has incurred unnecessarily due to the other side's conduct. For example, if a court hearing is postponed due to one party not turning up at court. As a result, the other party had to pay <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> fee for <b>a</b> <b>barrister,</b> for <b>a</b> hearing that ultimately did not take place.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give <b>briefs</b> to <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, <b>a</b> well-respected <b>barrister.</b> Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.|$|R
50|$|An {{abstract}} is <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> {{summary of}} <b>a</b> judicial judgment, usually written by <b>a</b> <b>Barrister</b> or academic {{for publication in}} law reports.|$|R
5000|$|The {{genesis of}} Trial by Jury began in 1868, when Gilbert wrote a single-page {{illustrated}} comic {{piece for the}} magazine Fun entitled Trial by Jury: An Operetta. Drawing on Gilbert's training and <b>brief</b> practice as <b>a</b> <b>barrister,</b> it detailed <b>a</b> [...] "breach of promise" [...] trial going awry, in the process spoofing the law, lawyers and the legal system. (In the Victorian era, a man could be required to pay compensation should he fail to marry a woman to whom he was engaged.) The outline of this story was followed in the later opera, and two of its numbers appeared in nearly their final form in Fun. The skit, however, ended abruptly: the moment the attractive plaintiff stepped into the witness box, the judge leapt into her arms and vowed to marry her, whereas in the opera, the case is allowed to proceed further before this conclusion is reached.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the war, he {{received}} an adult scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, and after <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> spell on <b>an</b> economics fellowship at the University of Cambridge (1948-50) he trained as <b>a</b> <b>barrister,</b> being called to the Bar in 1954.|$|R
5|$|As a child, Gilbert {{travelled}} to Italy in 1838 {{and then}} France {{for two years}} with his parents, who finally returned to settle in London in 1847. He was educated at Boulogne, France, {{from the age of}} seven (he later kept his diary in French so that the servants could not read it), then at Western Grammar School, Brompton, London, and then at the Great Ealing School, where he became head boy and wrote plays for school performances and painted scenery. He then attended King's College London, graduating in 1856. He intended to take the examinations for a commission in the Royal Artillery, but {{with the end of the}} Crimean War, fewer recruits were needed, and the only commission available to Gilbert would have been in a line regiment. Instead he joined the Civil Service: he was an assistant clerk in the Privy Council Office for four years and hated it. In 1859 he joined the Militia, a part-time volunteer force formed for the defence of Britain, with which he served until 1878 (in between writing and other work), reaching the rank of Captain. In 1863 he received a bequest of £300 that he used to leave the civil service and take up <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> career as <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> (he had already entered the Inner Temple as a student), but his legal practice was not successful, averaging just five clients a year.|$|R
50|$|After {{graduation}} {{he initially}} became a schoolteacher. In 1929 he resigned {{as a teacher}} to qualify as <b>a</b> <b>barrister.</b> In 1930 he was appointed as an associate to Justice Robert Douglas in Townsville. He was admitted as <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> in 1932 and then practiced as <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> in Townsville until his appointment as a judge.|$|R
50|$|After {{three years}} of {{training}} he became <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> being called to the bar by the Inner Temple; although it is unlikely he ever practised as <b>a</b> <b>barrister.</b>|$|R
50|$|Born in Sydney, Young {{was educated}} at Sydney Church of England Grammar School before graduating with a Bachelor of Laws from the Sydney Law School at the University of Sydney. Young's {{family has a}} strong legal pedigree. His father, James Young, was {{admitted}} as <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> in 1933; Young's grandfather, James Young Snr., was admitted as <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> in 1903; and Young's great-grandfather, Richard Young, was admitted as <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> in 1873. In more recent years, Young's eldest son, Marcus, also <b>a</b> <b>barrister,</b> was appointed as a Senior Counsel in 1993.|$|R

50|$|When <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> became <b>a</b> clerk he was statutorily {{debarred}} {{from acting}} as <b>a</b> <b>barrister.</b> Exceptions were occasionally made: at the 1682 Bedford Assize John Luke, the Clerk, represented Robert Chambers for an unspecified offence.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't become <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> {{to study}} morals, {{or even to}} {{consider}} them," [...] was the somewhat caustic reply. [...] "When once <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> is in my mind, {{it is a matter}} of brain, cunning and resource. The guiltier a man, the greater the success if you can get him off." ...|$|R
50|$|In law, a {{chambers}} is a room {{or office}} used by <b>barristers</b> or <b>a</b> judge. <b>A</b> <b>barrister's</b> chambers or barristers' chambers are the rooms used by <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> or <b>a</b> group of <b>barristers.</b> <b>A</b> judge's chambers, {{on the other}} hand, is {{the office of a}} judge, where the judge may hear certain types of cases, instead of in open court.|$|R
5000|$|He was <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> at the Eidsivating Court of Appeal from 1933 to 1945.

5000|$|After gaining ten years' {{experience}} as <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> or government counsel in Hong Kong, <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> admitted in Hong Kong may apply {{to become a}} Senior Counsel (S.C.). [...] Time in practice as <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> or lawyer in another jurisdiction or as a solicitor {{in private practice in}} Hong Kong does not count. [...] The Law Society of Hong Kong has called for this to be changed, so that solicitors may also be appointed Senior Counsel.|$|R
25|$|Despite its name, Section IV also {{contains}} provisions referring to barristers. Before {{the passing of}} the act there was no contractual relationship between <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> and the instructing solicitor, or between <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> and his client. This made it very difficult to obtain damages or recover money if there was <b>a</b> problem. <b>A</b> <b>barrister</b> was paid only as a matter of honour—there was no contract requiring that he be paid for his services, and no way of gaining his fee if he was not. The way that the legal profession got around this was by making it an act of professional misconduct for a solicitor not to pay the fees of <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> in <b>a</b> case.|$|R

5000|$|The Public Access Scheme (a.k.a. [...] "Direct Access") allows {{members of}} the public in England & Wales to {{instruct}} <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> directly.

5000|$|The {{difference}} between [...] "Barrister" [...] and [...] "Counsel" [...] is subtle. [...] "Barrister" [...] {{is a professional}} title awarded {{by one of the}} four Inns of Court, and is used in <b>a</b> <b>barrister's</b> private, academic or professional capacity. [...] "Counsel" [...] is used to refer to <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> who is instructed on a particular case. It is customary to use the third person when addressing <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> instructed on <b>a</b> case: [...] "Counsel is asked to advise" [...] rather than [...] "You are asked to advise".|$|R
