40|$|The {{three most}} common {{condition}} monitoring techniques {{were applied to}} laboratory test configurations that simulate biodegradable oil-filled transformer insulation system. The tested techniques were Dissolved Gas-in-oil Analysis (DGA), Partial Discharge (PD) detection and Polarization and Depolarization Current (POC) measurement. Dissolved hydro-carbon gas products generated by three fault types, arcing, overheating and partial discharge faults in <b>biodegradable</b> <b>oil,</b> were analysed according to the OGA technique. In the PO technique, discharge activities in <b>biodegradable</b> <b>oil</b> insulation were monitored using the standard phase resolved analysis method. The levels of PO activities and patterns of PO distributions in <b>biodegradable</b> <b>oil</b> were identified and analysed. The POC patterns of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>oil</b> at different moisture levels and after faults were analysed to obtain information {{on the level of}} conductivity, the dielectric response function and the moisture level of the oil. The <b>biodegradable</b> <b>oil</b> insulation system was found to have significantly different test results when compared to the mineral oil insulation system. Existing condition-monitoring techniques can be used to monitor <b>biodegradable</b> <b>oil</b> filled transformers but the fault identification and diagnosis for each technique needs to be modified. Thus new improvements were developed through this research to help achieve more accurate fault identification and prediction for biodegradable oil-filled transformers. Through the PO detection method, corona and surface discharge phase-resolved patterns in <b>biodegradable</b> <b>oil</b> insulation and their statistical parameters were identified. This enabled discrimination between these two types of discharge activities. As <b>biodegradable</b> <b>oil</b> has different trends of gas formation during faults, new versions of two OGA fault gas interpretation methods were proposed (the Duval Triangle and Roger's Ratio methods). These fault predictions were developed based on the fault gases released by <b>biodegradable</b> <b>oil</b> during faults in the presence and absence of pressboard and at different moisture levels. These new versions of fault gas interpretation methods will allow more accurate fault prediction for <b>biodegradable</b> <b>oil</b> transformer applications. Based on POC measurements of the <b>biodegradable</b> <b>oil</b> in a healthy oil condition at different moisture levels and after faults, fault identification can be achieved by comparing the PDC pattern of an oil sample against the PDC fingerprints. Furthermore, the relationship curves between the oil moisture level toward its conductivity level and measured capacitance value have been established. These curves can be used to predict the oil moisture condition and the fault type. Currently there are no specific standards published on monitoring and faults diagnosis of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>oil</b> filled transformers.

It is reasonable to expect that in steel/DLC contacts, at least the steel counter body will behave according to conventional lubrication mechanisms and will interact with lubricants and additives in the contact. However, in DLC/DLC contacts, such mechanisms are still unclear. For example, the "inertness" of DLC coatings raises several questions about whether {{they are able to}} provide real boundary "lubrication" or whether they are just a "passive" member in these contacts. On the other hand, <b>biodegradable</b> <b>oils,</b> in particular vegetable base oils, possess a good lubricating ability, often much better than mineral or conventional synthetic oils {{as a result of the}} large amount of un-saturated and polar components thatcan promote the lubricity of DLC coatings.

Performance evaluation as pour point depressant, viscosity modifier or viscosity index improver and antiwear in different base oils (BO 1, BO 2) was carried out by standard ASTM methods.

The wastewater discharged from the restaurant has raised the concern on water pollution. However, current methods available to treat such wastewater have several setbacks such as high capital cost, large space requirement to operate, extensive maintenance activities and failure to remove FOG to meet discharge standards. In this study, oil sorption efficiency and hydrophobic-oleophilic characteristics of an agricultural product, Kapok (Ciebapentandra) was thoroughly examined for its feasibility as an absorbent medium to treat restaurant wastewater. The objectives are to evaluate the effect of various packing densities of kapok filter on the outlet flow rate and on the cooking oil absorption efficiency. The results were later used to design a compact <b>biodegradable</b> <b>oil</b> absorption filter to remove FOG {{as well as on}} the surfactant concentrations in oil emulsion. Based on the results obtained, the best packing density for the Kapok filter design under gravitational pressure gradient is 0. 02 g/cm 3 since it contributes to better outlet flow rate, high filtration efficiency (96 %) with the least filtrate turbidity and has larger size of the effective flow channel and area to entrap the emulsified oil. Based on UV Spectrometer analysis, the result shows that the surfactant could not be separated from the water-surfactant mixture. However, the presence of surfactant in water-oil mixture does not affect the efficiency of kapok filter system.

The lubricants are mostly of mineral origin, they are toxic and not readily biodegradable. The catastrophe due to the intensive pollution of environment, threatening the planet Earth, draws the public attention and ecological awareness demanding the development of the ecologically acceptable lubricants. The ecologically acceptable lubricants when put into contact with the environment produce minimum of harmful effects.

The lube oil additives commonly used are viscosity modifier (VM) or viscosity index improver [4], pour point depressant (PPD) [5], antioxidant [6, 7], antiwear [8, 9], extreme pressure agent etc. Since multifunctional additives induce more than one of the above performances, research throughout the world is increasingly directed toward producing such type additives.

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, {{significant}} {{attention has}} been paid to <b>biodegradable</b> vegetable <b>oils</b> as an alternative to mineral insulating oils. This study presents the influence of electrical discharges and thermal stress on the variation of the properties of uninhibited olive oil. This latter constitutes a serious environmentally friendly and renewable substitute for currently used mineral oils. The investigated properties are: dielectric loss factor and permittivity, resistivity, acid number, cinematic viscosity, water content, breakdown voltage, flash point and colour index. To analyse the effect of thermal stress, the uninhibited olive oil was aged in sealed bottles at 110 °C for durations up to 716 h. As concerns the electrical stress, series of 200 up to 1600 low energy discharges are applied under 50 Hz alternating divergent electric field. Frequency domain spectroscopy has also been performed in order to assess the oil behaviour in a large frequency range (20 Hz- 1 MHz). The real part of the complex dielectric permittivity of oil tends to increase with ageing. The obtained results show an acceptable stability with regard to thermal ageing and even an improvement of the oil key properties when submitted to discharges of controlled low energy level...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of natural}} fibres {{obtained}} from plants and trees as reinforcing materials has attracted many researchers to widen their applications. Natural fibres are low cost, low density, have high specific properties, <b>biodegradable</b> and non-abrasive. <b>Oil</b> palm fibre (OPF) can be obtained directly from natural resource, it is cheap and also has advantages due to its renewable nature, low cost, and easy availability. In this study, the mechanical performances of single oil palm fibre are measured and evaluated. The diameter of OPF was {{in the range from}} 250 to 610 μm while moisture content was between 2. 2 to 9. 5 %. The average tensile properties obtained were tensile strength, 71 MPa, Young’s modulus, 1703 MPa and elongation at break, 11 %...|$|R
