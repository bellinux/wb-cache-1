This {{is supported by the}} positive results of the NTP bioassays with Ni sub-sulfide and Ni oxide in rats and mice. The human and animal data consistently indicate a lack of carcinogenicity via the oral route of exposure and limit the carcinogenicity of nickel compounds to respiratory tumours after inhalation. Nickel metal is classified as a suspect carcinogen; there is consistency between the absence of increased respiratory cancer risks in workers predominantly exposed to metallic nickel and the lack of respiratory tumours in a rat lifetime inhalation carcinogenicity study with nickel metal powder. In the rodent inhalation studies with various nickel compounds and nickel metal, increased lung inflammations with and without <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> hyperplasia or fibrosis were observed. In rat studies, oral ingestion of water soluble nickel salts can trigger perinatal mortality effects in pregnant animals. Whether these effects are relevant to humans is unclear as epidemiological studies of highly exposed female workers have not shown adverse developmental toxicity effects.|$|E
40|$|IntroductionPatients with stage II non-small cell lung {{carcinoma}} (NSCLC) {{represent a}} heterogeneous subgroup with variable 5 -year survival rates. The {{influence of the}} type of lymph node involvement on survival and recurrence was investigated. MethodsA total of 128 consecutive patients who underwent complete tumor resection and mediastinal lymph nodes dissection for pT 1 - 2 N 1 M 0 NSCLC between July 1991 and December 2003 were retrospectively reviewed. ResultsThe overall 5 -year survival of patients with T 1 - 2 N 1 M 0 disease was 42. 2 %. Although pT status, histology, surgical procedure, and adjuvant therapy did not affect survival for pT 1 - 2 N 1 M 0 patients, the 5 -year survival rate differed significantly according to the type of lymph node involvement. The 5 -year survival rate for patients with main <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement, interlobar and lobar lymph node involvement, and segmental <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement was 19. 7 %, 39. 8 %, and 59. 7 %, respectively. The survival curves of these three groups had significant differences. Fifty-five patients had cancer recurrence, and the type of lymph node involvement did not affect the pattern of cancer relapse. ConclusionsIn patients with stage II NSCLC, survival differs according to the type of lymph node involvement: patients with only segmental lymph node involvement have a better prognosis and the disease seems to be at an early stage, whereas patients with main <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement have a poorer prognosis, and main <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement represents more advanced disease.

40|$|International audienceTimothy grass (Phleum pratense) pollen allergens are an {{important}} cause of allergic symptoms. However, pollen grains are too large to penetrate the deeper airways. Grass pollen is known to release allergen-bearing starch granules (SG) upon contact with water. These granules can create an inhalable allergenic aerosol capable of triggering an early asthmatic response and are implicated in thunderstorm-associated asthma. We studied the humoral (IgE) and <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells reactivities to SG from timothy grass pollen in pollen-sensitized rats. Brown-Norway rats were sensitized (day 0) and challenged (day 21) intratracheally with intact pollen and kept immunized by pollen intranasal instillation by 4 weeks intervals during 3 months. Blood and bronchial lymph nodes were collected 7 days after the last intranasal challenge. SG were purified from fresh timothy grass pollen using 5 mum mesh filters. To determine the humoral response (IgE) to SG, we developed an original ELISA inhibition test, based on competition between pollen allergens and purified SG. The cell-mediated response to SG in the <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells was determined by measuring the uptake of [H- 3]thymidine in a proliferation assay. An antibody response to SG was induced, and purified SG were able to inhibit the IgE ELISA absorbance by 45 %. Pollen extract and intact pollen gave inhibitions of 55 % and 52 %, respectively. A cell-mediated response was also found, as pollen extract, intact pollen and SG triggered proliferation of <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells. It was confirmed that timothy grass pollen contains allergen-loaded SG, which are released upon contact with water. These granules were shown to be recognized by pollen-sensitized rats sera and to trigger lymph node cell proliferation in these rats. These data provide new arguments supporting the implication of grass pollen SG in allergic asthma...|$|E

Pulmonary clearance of R. equi requires functional CD 41 T cells and gamma interferon (IFN-g) expression from <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate whether R. equi-specific CD 41 Th 1 cells could effect clearance of R. equi from the lung. Adoptive transfer of a Th 1 cell line into nude mice resulted in expression of IFN-g mRNA locally in <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells and clearance of R. equi from the lungs. In contrast, mice transfused with a R. equi-specific CD 41 Th 2 cell line expressed interleukin- 4 but not IFN-g mRNA, failed to clear pulmonary infection, and developed large granulomas in the lung. Control mice, which did not receive cells, did not produce IFN-g or interleukin- 4 and developed small pulmonary granulomas. These results clearly show that a Th 1 response is sufficient to effect pulmonary clearance of R. equi. Rhodococcus equi, a gram-positive intracellular bacterium, is an emerging opportunistic pathogen in human AIDS patients and a common respiratory pathogen in young horses (7, 25).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after birth cytokine expression by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cells from piglets infected in utero with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Technically, by flow cytometry we were able to measure gamma interferon (γ-IFN), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), and IL- 8 levels. In general, we found increases in the percentages of IL- 4 -, γ-IFN-, and TNF-α-producing lymphocytes in the infected piglets compared to the percentages in the uninfected control animals, while there was a decrease in the percentage of IL- 8 -producing monocytes. We believe that these findings reflect a general lymphocyte activation stage that is created due to the infection and that occurs in combination with impairment of the monocyte function, possibly due to the ongoing viral replication in these cells. Single-cell <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> preparations exhibited very much the same cytokine profiles as peripheral blood mononuclear cells except for a lack of IL- 8 production. When the levels of the individual cytokines in the three groups of PRRSV-infected piglets were compared, the levels of cytokine expression at 4 weeks diverged from those at 2 and 6 weeks, in that there was a significant decrease in the numbers of lymphocytes producing γ-IFN and TNF-α.

Clearance of the organism from the lung requires functional CD 4 + T cells. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the cytokine effector mechanisms that mediate clearance of R. equi from the lung. Mice were treated with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to either gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) or interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) to determine the role of endogenous production of these cytokines in pulmonary clearance of R. equi. Mice treated with an anti-IL- 4 or isotype control MAb cleared R. equi by 21 days postinfection and expressed increased levels of IFN-gamma mRNA, as detected by transcriptional analysis of <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> CD 4 + T cells.

40|$|Rhodococcus equi is a facultative {{intracellular}} pathogen {{that causes}} pneumonia in foals {{but does not}} induce disease in adult horses. Virulence of R. equi depends {{on the presence of}} a large plasmid, which encodes a family of seven virulence-associated proteins (VapA and VapC to VapH). Eradication of R. equi from the lungs depends on gamma interferon (IFN-γ) production by T lymphocytes. The objectives of the present study were to determine the relative in vivo expression of the vap genes of R. equi in the lungs of infected foals, to determine the recall response of <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> (BLN) lymphocytes from foals and adult horses to each of the Vap proteins, and to compare the cytokine profiles of proliferating lymphocytes between foals and adult horses. vapA, vapD, and vapG were preferentially expressed in the lungs of infected foals, and expression of these genes in the lungs was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than that achieved during in vitro growth.

40|$|In various {{allergic}} and inflammatory lung diseases {{the number}} and subset composition of lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid are taken as indicators {{of the state of}} the disease. The number of lymphocytes in the BAL fluid depends on three main parameters: (1) entry into the bronchoalveolar space from the different compartments of the lung, (2) persistence in the bronchoalveolar space which is modified by the rate of local proliferation and apoptosis, and (3) exit into the draining <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> via the lymphatic system. In healthy individuals lymphocytes in the BAL fluid seem to be a stable pool: each day there is hardly any entry, local cell division or cell death and few lymphocytes emigrate from this compartment.

Very little is known about factors such as cytokines and chemokines which may regulate these parameters.

40|$|The {{heterologous}} adoptive cutaneous anaphylaxis {{system was}} used to determine the kinetics of appearance of IgE-producing cells in various lymphoid tissues of mice following intratracheal (i. t.), intraperitoneal (i. p.), or subcutaneous (s. c.) immunization with tetanus toxoid and Bordetella pertussis organisms. Immunization, i. t. and i. p., produced similar patterns of response with the bronchial lymph nodes quantitatively exceeding the responses in other lymphoid tissues. In both cases the splenic lymphocyte response was second only to the bronchial and both appeared to parallel the serum PCA antibody. It is suggested that both responses represent draining lymph node responses since the <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> drains both sites of immunization. After s. c. immunization a primary response of low order was found in the draining popliteal lymph node but not elsewhere. Although a dissociation was seen between responses obtained in various lymphoid tissues following s. c. and i. p. or i. t. immunization, no real evidence for a local mucosal response, such as has been reported for IgA, was obtained. These results lend experimental support to the observations that intratracheal and intraperitoneal immunization routes are most effective in production of IgE antibodies...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} a fatal case of idiopathic polyarthritis in {{a dog that}} was partially responsive to vigorous immunosuppressive treatment. Synovial fluids were cultured for L-forms at the following stages of disease: (i) acute arthritic relapse, (ii) incomplete remission, and (iii) death. Nocardia asteroides UCD 1 - 581 was recovered from the L-form broth culture of the specimen taken during acute relapse, 5 weeks after inoculation, but not at any other stage of disease. Numerous conventional microbiological cultures were unproductive during all phases. Changes occurring in L-form plates included the formation of large irregular mineral deposits and many transferable bodies resembling pseudocolonies. Microscopic examination revealed the presence of many intracellular golden-brown granules and acid-fast bodies in macrophages of the lung and <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> tissues. The granules {{are believed to be}} the variants embedded in calcium deposits similar to those which developed in the L-form cultures in vitro. Fluorescence of these acid-fast bodies with antibody specific for superoxide dismutase of N. asteroides GUH- 2 and labeled anti-immunoglobulin G established their relationship to the isolate. The unrelenting course of disease and the persistence of N. asteroides as an L-form in this animal despite vigorous immunosuppression suggest that this organism plays a direct role in the etiology of this disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of allergies and asthma has increased {{significantly in the}} past few decades. The objectives of this study were to establish an allergy model in weanling rats to more closely reflect the developing immune system of children, and to determine whether systemic administration of inactivated Bordetella pertussis could enhance pulmonary and systemic immune responses to locally administered house dust mite antigen (HDM). Three-week old female Brown Norway rats were sensitized with 10 �g HDM intratracheally or intraperitoneally, with or without a simultaneous injection of 10 8 whole killed B. pertussis organisms. Ten days later, all the rats were challenged with 5 �g HDM via the trachea. <b>Bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) were collected 0, 2, and 4 days post-challenge. Coadministration of pertussis and intratracheal instillation of HDM enhance...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{findings}} {{in an adult}} bull terrier presented {{with a history of}} anorexia and weight loss included the following: severe anaemia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopaenia, thrombocytopaenia, Ehrlichia canis morulae in monocytes, hypergammaglo-bulinaemia, a bleeding tendency, icterus and proteinuria. In addition, a high Haemobartonella canis parasitaemia, non-encapsulated yeasts on urinalysis and a localised Demodex canis infestation were present. Treatment for ehrlichiosis was initiated but the dog died. Lesions found were a severe cryptococcal granulomatous pneumonia and cryptococcal colonies in the lungs, <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> kidneys, liver, spleen, heart, meninges, eyes and thoracic cavity. In addition, hyphal forms resembling Filobasidiella neoformans, the teleomorph of Cryptococcus neoformans, were seen in lung fine needle aspiration smears, impression smears and lung sections. C. neoformans was cultured from urine, lung and liver. Lung and kidney also yielded Salmonella typhimureum. Cortical atrophy with T-cell depletion of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> as well as splenic lymphoid follicular atrophy, typical of chronic ehrlichiosis-induced cell mediated immunosuppression, could have predisposed to the fatal disseminated cryptococcis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Systemic {{infection}} by Nocardia asteroides {{was diagnosed}} in a reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus). At necropsy, the animal had enlarged tracheobronchial <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> pleural and peritoneal effusions, and numerous, multifocal to coalescing, yellow, firm nodules with inspissated pus in the lung, pleura, omentum, liver, heart, adrenal glands, and left kidney. Microscopically, the nodules consisted of foci of pyogranulomatous inflammation. Microscopic lesions {{were present in}} the grossly affected organs as well as spleen and brain. Sections stained with Gram and modified Fite-Faraco histochemical stains had numerous gram-positive, variably acid fast, beaded and branching filamentous organisms in the necrotic centers. N. asteroides was isolated from the lung, <b>bronchial</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> liver, and left kidney. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of systemic N. asteroides infection in a reindeer. Key words: Kidney; lung; Nocardia asteroides; reindeer; systemic infection. Nocardiosis is a suppurative or, less frequently, pyogran-ulomatous disease caused by aerobic bacteria of the genus Nocardia. 3 These gram-positive, branching and partially acid fast bacteria cause localized or systemic disease.
