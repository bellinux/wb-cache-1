5|$|Fried <b>butter</b> is {{a similar}} dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century. The first known recipe for fried <b>butter</b> dates to 1615. Fried <b>butter</b> was {{documented}} in the cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy in 1747. The recipe entailed soaking <b>butter</b> in salted water for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and roasting it under a low fire while continuously covering it with egg yolks and additional bread crumbs. Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E
5000|$|Humorous {{observations}} {{have been}} made about <b>buttered</b> toast. It has been noted that <b>buttered</b> toast has a perceived tendency, when dropped, to land with the <b>buttered</b> side to the floor, the least desirable outcome. Although the concept of [...] "dropped <b>buttered</b> toast" [...] was originally a pessimistic joke, a 2001 study of the <b>buttered</b> toast phenomenon found that when dropped from a table, a <b>buttered</b> slice of toast landed butter-side down at least 62% of the time. The phenomenon is widely believed to be attributable to {{the combination of the}} size of the toast and the height of the typical dining table, which means that the toast will not rotate far enough to right itself before encountering the floor. A joke that plays on this tendency is the <b>buttered</b> cat paradox; if cats always land on their feet and <b>buttered</b> toast always lands <b>buttered</b> side down, it questions what happens when <b>buttered</b> toast is attached to a cat's back.|$|R
50|$|A {{weakened}} <b>Butters</b> {{makes his}} way to the hospital but his disguise fools the attending doctor, who sends <b>Butters</b> to the local animal shelter. There, the veterinarian determines that the only {{thing to do is to}} put <b>Butters</b> to sleep. Just before he does, <b>Butters</b> escapes again and heads for the fair. So he decides to put another dog to sleep.|$|R
5000|$|Cartman is set {{to replace}} <b>Butters</b> when Butters' parents tearfully inform the boys that <b>Butters</b> is missing. Kyle postpones his party, and Cartman hears police will be {{checking}} bomb shelters, potentially ruining his plan. He then tells <b>Butters</b> that the meteor has hit, civilization has crumbled, and {{that the world is}} filled with radioactive cannibals. He moves <b>Butters</b> to a broken-down gas station where he locks him in an abandoned refrigerator for his protection. After Cartman leaves for Casa Bonita with Kyle, a garbage truck comes and takes <b>Butters</b> to the city dump. <b>Butters</b> mistakes the dump for post-apocalyptic Earth, and after finding a dog, tries to build a [...] "new civilization." [...] A junkyard worker stumbles across <b>Butters</b> and tells him where he really is, and that everyone is fine and they have been searching for him for more than a week.|$|R
5|$|Illipe <b>butter,</b> {{from the}} nuts of the Shorea stenoptera. Similar to cocoa <b>butter,</b> {{but with a}} higher melting point. Used in cosmetics.|$|E
5|$|Nutmeg <b>butter,</b> {{extracted}} by expression {{from the}} fruit of s of genus Myristica. Nutmeg <b>butter</b> has {{a large amount of}} trimyristin. Nutmeg oil, by contrast, is an essential oil, extracted by steam distillation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Butters,</b> however, is not {{privy to}} the plan and greets Cartman as he passes by {{in a state of}} despair. Cartman convinces <b>Butters</b> that he is a ghost, terrifying him. Cartman threatens to haunt <b>Butters</b> unless he helps his soul achieve peace. Cartman first has <b>Butters</b> {{apologize}} to everyone on his behalf, which fails to impress his ex-friends but gets his mother crying. Cartman makes emotional goodbyes to <b>Butters,</b> believing that he will now be permitted to go to Heaven. When this fails, <b>Butters</b> suggests he might need to atone for all the terrible things he has done. Cartman draws up a long list and delivers gift baskets to all his victims, including Sally Struthers, Scott Tenorman, and Kyle's synagogue. When this, too, fails, Cartman destroys Butters' room with a baseball bat and disappears before his parents turn up. A doctor is called and decides that <b>Butters</b> might suffer from a deep trauma. To make sure, <b>Butters</b> is taken to a mental institution and subjected to a terrifying series of tests. Now genuinely traumatized, <b>Butters</b> accepts that he has been imagining Cartman's visits, but Cartman breaks into the asylum to get his help again.|$|R
50|$|<b>Butters</b> expresses {{excitement}} about his parents' upcoming anniversary, {{which they are}} going to celebrate at Butters' favorite restaurant, Bennigan's. A few days before their anniversary, Mrs. Stotch asks <b>Butters</b> to spy on Mr. Stotch in order to find out what his gift for her will be so that her own won't fall short. While spying, <b>Butters</b> watches his dad enter first a gay theater and then a gay bathhouse (though <b>Butters</b> is too naive {{to understand the nature of}} his father's activity). Upon returning home, <b>Butters</b> reports to his mother about his father's whereabouts, leaving her appalled by her husband's homosexual affairs, becoming visibly distraught and unhinged. Mrs. Stotch then attempts to murder <b>Butters</b> by dumping her car in a river with him inside.|$|R
5000|$|Lily Esther <b>Butters,</b> [...] (1894 [...] - [...] June 3, 1980) was a Canadian {{who founded}} the Cecil <b>Butters</b> Memorial Hospital, or the <b>Butters</b> Centre, which cared for mentally {{disabled}} children. It was named in honour of her son, Cecil. It operated from 1947 to 1990.|$|R
5|$|The {{debut of}} deep-fried <b>butter</b> in 2010 at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Canada {{may have led}} to a rise in {{attendance}} at the event. During the 18-day event in 2010, the concession stand purveying the dish sold 9,000 orders, which equated to 36,000 individual deep-fried <b>butter</b> balls using 800 pounds of <b>butter.</b> The dish was served in portions of four balls at the event, which totaled 315 calories.|$|E
5|$|The {{marginal}} rate {{of transformation}} {{can be expressed}} in terms of either commodity. The marginal opportunity costs of guns in terms of <b>butter</b> is simply the reciprocal of the marginal opportunity cost of <b>butter</b> in terms of guns. If, for example, the (absolute) slope at point BB in the diagram is equal to 2, to produce one more packet of <b>butter,</b> the production of 2 guns must be sacrificed. If at AA, the marginal opportunity cost of <b>butter</b> in terms of guns is equal to 0.25, the sacrifice of one gun could produce four packets of <b>butter,</b> and the opportunity cost of guns in terms of <b>butter</b> is 4.|$|E
5|$|A fluffernutter is a {{sandwich}} made with peanut <b>butter</b> and marshmallow fluff usually served on white bread. Variations of the sandwich include {{the substitution of}} wheat bread {{and the addition of}} various sweet, salty and savory ingredients.

50|$|On the battlefield, {{the good}} {{characters}} seem doomed. Lead by Jesus, the good characters charge, {{but they are}} suffering from many characters. Aslan orders <b>Butters</b> he must imagine Santa which <b>Butters</b> imagines, yet this version is a monstrous cephalopod creature. <b>Butters</b> is terrified and it abruptly fades away. However, <b>Butters</b> manages to master his conjuring ability, and summons appropriate forces that join the battle, and turn the tide in good's favor by focusing and imaging on the good.|$|R
5000|$|The {{boys are}} {{watching}} {{an episode of}} Maury on which several children with bodily defects are shown. A girl born with no midsection wins a gift certificate, so Kyle, Stan, Cartman, and <b>Butters</b> decide {{to try to get}} on the show with a faked deformity to win a prize. The group decide that <b>Butters</b> should be the one to go on the show with a scrotum on his chin, which Cartman called [...] "Chinballitis." [...] <b>Butters</b> doesn't want to go, but the other boys guilt him into doing so. <b>Butters</b> then reluctantly agrees, and the town's two sci-fi geeks make fake balls to put on <b>Butters.</b>|$|R

5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut <b>butter</b> on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut <b>butter,</b> and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut <b>butter</b> and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut <b>butter</b> and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E
5|$|A {{version of}} deep-fried <b>butter</b> {{on a stick}} debuted at the Iowa State Fair 2011, which was {{prepared}} using frozen <b>butter</b> that is dipped in a honey- and cinnamon- flavored batter, deep-fried until browned, and then topped with a confectioner's sugar glaze. This concoction on a stick was invented by Larry Fyfe, an entrepreneur and concessionaire at the fair. Versions at the Iowa State Fair have also been prepared and served formed as balls. Deep-fried <b>butter</b> has also been served on a stick at the State Fair of Texas.|$|E
5|$|Beurre Maître d'Hôtel is a savory <b>butter</b> {{prepared}} by mixing softened <b>butter</b> with very finely minced parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. A ratio of around 1.5 tablespoons of parsley to two ounces of <b>butter</b> may be used. Additional ingredients may include shallot and Worcestershire sauce. Vinegar is sometimes used, although its inclusion is rare. Cayenne pepper {{has also been}} used. After mixing, it is typically rolled in parchment paper or plastic wrap and chilled to harden.|$|E
40|$|There {{is a clear}} {{consumer}} need for new textures and for natural and food inspired ingredients in cosmetics. Natural <b>butters</b> are fully in line with these trends. As a result, more and more products containing <b>butters</b> are launched on the European cosmetic market. They are found mainly in skincare and colour cosmetic products. <b>Butters</b> are used as emollients, texturing agents or to perfume finished products. Depending on their composition, their sensorial profiles will vary. <b>Butters</b> are also very effective marketing tools...|$|R
5000|$|A young {{housewife}} {{living in}} the town of Chełm had a very strange occurrence. One morning, after <b>buttering</b> a piece of bread she accidentally dropped it on the floor. To her amazement, it fell <b>buttered</b> side up.As everyone knows, whenever a <b>buttered</b> piece of bread is dropped on the floor, it always falls <b>buttered</b> side down; this is like a law of physics. But on this occasion it had fallen <b>buttered</b> side up, and this was a great mystery which had to be solved. So all the Rabbis and elders and wise men of Chełm were summoned together and they spent three days in the synagogue fasting and praying and debating this marvelous event among themselves. After those three days they returned to the young housewife with this answer:"Madam, the problem is that you have <b>buttered</b> {{the wrong side of the}} bread." ...|$|R

When Lisa does this, <b>Butters</b> turns her down. When Wendy excoriates <b>Butters</b> for this, <b>Butters</b> explains that he likes women who are gorgeous like his crush Kim Kardashian. Wendy angrily tells <b>Butters</b> that Kim has [...] "the body of a hobbit", and that commercialized images of her are photoshopped to make her look attractive, and lead to poor body image {{on the part of}} average-looking females.|$|R

5|$|Deep-fried <b>butter</b> is a snack food {{comprising}} <b>butter</b> that is {{coated with}} a batter or breading and then deep-fried. The dish has been served at several fairs in the United States; among them, the State Fair of Texas in Dallas, Texas, and the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, Iowa; {{and now it is}} served worldwide. It has a significant buttery flavor, which has been compared to that of French toast. Fried <b>butter</b> is a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|For example, if {{one assumes}} that the economy's {{available}} quantities of factors of production do not change over time and that technological progress does not occur, if the economy is operating on the PPF, production of guns {{would need to be}} sacrificed to produce more <b>butter.</b> If production is efficient, the economy can choose between combinations (points) on the PPF: B if guns are of interest, C if more <b>butter</b> is needed, D if an equal mix of <b>butter</b> and guns is required.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of a PPF, {{opportunity}} cost {{is directly related to the}} shape of the curve (see below). If the shape of the PPF curve is a straight-line, the opportunity cost is constant as production of different goods is changing. But, opportunity cost usually will vary depending on the start and end points. In the diagram on the right, producing 10 more packets of <b>butter,</b> at a low level of <b>butter</b> production, costs the loss of 5 guns (shown as a movement from A to B). At point C, the economy is already close to its maximum potential <b>butter</b> output. To produce 10 more packets of <b>butter,</b> 50 guns must be sacrificed (as with a movement from C to D). The ratio of gains to losses is determined by the marginal rate of transformation.|$|E
