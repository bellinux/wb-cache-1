25|$|Kovel follows Marx's {{theories}} about the contradiction between use values and exchange values. As he explains in The Enemy of Nature, within a market economy, goods are not produced to meet needs but are produced to be exchanged for money that we then use to acquire other goods. As {{we have to keep}} selling in order to keep buying, we must persuade others to <b>buy</b> <b>our</b> goods just to ensure our survival, which leads to the production of goods with no previous use that can be sold to sustain our ability to buy other goods. Kovel stresses that this contradiction has reached a destructive extent, where certain essential activities – such as caring for relatives full-time and basic subsistence – are unrewarded, while unnecessary economic activities earn certain individuals huge fortunes.|$|E
2500|$|British Prime Minister Asquith {{wrote to}} Stanley: [...] "The European {{situation}} {{is at least}} one degree worse than it was yesterday, and has not been improved by a rather shameless attempt on the part of Germany to <b>buy</b> <b>our</b> neutrality during the war by promises that she will not annex French territory (except colonies) or Holland or Belgium. There is something very crude & childlike about German diplomacy. Meanwhile the French are beginning to press in the opposite sense, as the Russians have been doing for some time.

2500|$|Early in {{his career}} at Hardin–Simmons, Turner and {{teammate}} A. J. Roy encouraged each other in practice sessions by referring to each other by nicknames. Turner was given the nickname [...] "Bulldog", and Roy was known as [...] "Tiger". Turner later recalled his college experience as follows: [...] "We got room, board and tuition, {{but we had to}} <b>buy</b> <b>our</b> own books and we were supposed to take care of two jobs. I had to sweep out the gym and wait tables, but I kind of farmed out the sweeping after a while. It was tough but I loved it. And the more I played, the more I liked the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 6, 1973, Syria and Egypt, {{with support}} from other Arab nations, {{launched}} a surprise attack on Israel, on Yom Kippur. This renewal of hostilities in the Arab–Israeli conflict released the underlying economic pressure on oil prices. At the time, Iran was the world's second-largest oil exporter and a close US ally. Weeks later, the Shah of Iran said in an interview: [...] "Of course [...] is going to rise... Certainly! And how!... You've [...] increased {{the price of the}} wheat you sell us by 300 percent, and the same for sugar and cement... You <b>buy</b> <b>our</b> crude oil and sell it back to us, refined as petrochemicals, at a hundred times the price you've paid us... It's only fair that, from now on, you should pay more for oil.

My conclusion is that, in my experience, a translator’s work is extremely varied, both in terms of the type of texts he or she has to work with and the terminological problems that have to be solved. Finally, I touch on the Norwegian market for translations and the competition situation, which has become tougher in recent years and led to structural changes, {{largely as a result of}} increased use of competitive tendering for translation jobs...|$|R
