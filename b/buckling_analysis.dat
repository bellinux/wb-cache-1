50|$|The Direct Strength Method (DSM) is an {{alternative}} method of design located in Appendix 1 of the North American Specification for the Design of Cold-formed Steel Structural Members 2007 (AISI S100-07). DSM {{may be used in}} lieu of the Main Specification for determining nominal member capacities. Specific advantages include the absence of effective width and iterations, while only using known gross-sectional properties. An increase in prediction confidence stems from forced compatibility between section flanges and web throughout elastic <b>buckling</b> <b>analysis.</b> This increase in prediction accuracy for any section geometry provides a solid basis for rational analysis extension and encourages cross-sectional optimization. Either DSM or the main specification can be used with confidence as the Φ or Ω factors have been designed to insure that both methods are accurate. Currently, DSM only provides solutions for beams and columns and has to be used in conjunction with the main specification for a complete design.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{supercavitating}} {{vehicle is}} an underwater vehicle that is surrounded almost completely by a supercavity to reduce hydrodynamic drag substantially. Since the cruise {{speed of the}} vehicle is much higher than that of conventional submarines, the drag force is huge and a buckling may occur. The buckling phenomenon is analyzed in this study through static and dynamic approaches. Critical buckling load and pressure as well as buckling mode shapes are calculated using static <b>buckling</b> <b>analysis</b> and a stability map is obtained from dynamic <b>buckling</b> <b>analysis.</b> When the finite element method (FEM) is used for the <b>buckling</b> <b>analysis,</b> the solver requires a linear static solver and an eigenvalue solver.

40|$|A jacket, or template, {{structures}} {{are still the}} most common offshore structures used for drilling and production. Fixed jacket structures consist of tubular members interconnected to form a threedimensional space frame. Hence, the jacket structure can be categorized into a column structure. The D/t ratio of a typical member on the jacket structure has significant influence to buckling strength. Although only the axial load acts on the jacket legs, the local and global deformation of the structural member due to this load {{must be taken into}} account. This paper discusses the effect of D/t ratio on fixed jacket platform in the <b>buckling</b> strength <b>analysis.</b> A kind of fixed jacket offshore structure namely tripod is taken as the object of the analysis. Only the axial load is considered and it is applied to all jacket legs. The material and dimension of the structure are taken based on the structural member.

40|$|Heat transfer, thermal stresses, {{and thermal}} {{buckling}} {{analyses were performed}} on the unconventional wing structures of a Hyper-X hypersonic flight research vehicle (designated as X- 43) subjected to nominal Mach 7 aerodynamic heating. A wing midspan cross section was selected for the heat transfer and thermal stress analyses.

40|$|The main {{motivation}} for this thesis {{study is that}} significant workload for aging transport aircrafts is related to dent removal from fuselages. This thesis is a preliminary investigation of aircraft fuselage dents using the Finite Element Method (FEM) via FEA ABAQUS software. We investigated single impact dent on fuselage panel at various locations and impact speeds. The material used for our finite element models is Aluminum Alloy 2024 -T 3, a typical material used for fuselages of older transport aircrafts. Our finite element model consisted of impact <b>analysis,</b> <b>buckling</b> prediction <b>analysis,</b> and postbuckling analysis successively. These analyses were performed on both stiffened and unstiffened aluminum panels. We found that, depending on dent status in aluminum panel, the dent may increase or decrease buckling load of the panel {{compared to that of}} the virgin panel (undented). The buckling load of panel with low velocity impact is generally lower than that of the virgin plate. As the impact velocity is increased, buckling load of dented panel increases exceeding buckling load of virgin plate. In addition, we also noticed an existence of critical impact velocity at which the buckling load of the dented panel reached maximum and after which will start to decrease.
