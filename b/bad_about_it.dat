2500|$|Referred to as a [...] "stoner rap" [...] by Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{the lyrics}} are mostly nonsensical. The song's chorus, in which Beck sings the lines [...] "Soy un perdedor/I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?", is often {{interpreted}} as a parody of Generation X's [...] "slacker" [...] culture. Beck has denied the validity of this meaning, instead saying that the chorus is simply about his lack of skill as a rapper. Jon Pareles wrote in The New York Times that [...] "The sentiment of 'Loser' [...] reflects the twentysomething trademark, a mixture of self-mockery and sardonic defiance", noting Beck's [...] "offhand vocal tone and free-associative lyrics" [...] and comparing his vocals to [...] "Bob Dylan talk-singing". After its recording, Beck thought that the song was interesting but unimpressive. He later said, [...] "The raps and vocals are all first takes. If I’d known the impact {{it was going to}} make, I would have put something a little more substantial in it." [...] The relationship between Beck and Stephenson soured after the release of [...] "Loser" [...] as a single. Stephenson regretted his involvement in creating the song, in particular the [...] "negative" [...] lyrics, saying [...] "I feel <b>bad</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It's not Beck the person, it's the words. I just wish I could have been more of a positive influence." ...|$|E
