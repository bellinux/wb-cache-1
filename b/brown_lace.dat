6000|$|That evening, having {{inspected}} {{what they}} had brought, he stayed up to dinner, sitting between them at the little round table they used when they were alone. He was extremely excited. His mother wore a French-grey dress, with creamy lace made out of little scriggly roses, round her neck, which was <b>browner</b> than the <b>lace.</b> He kept looking at her, till at last his father's funny smile made him suddenly attentive to his slice of pineapple. It was later {{than he had ever}} stayed up, when he went to bed. His mother went up with him, and he undressed very slowly so as to keep her there. When at last he had nothing on but his pyjamas, he said: ...|$|R
60|$|He had {{straight}} black hair, parted up {{the middle}} of his head and hanging down upon his coat; a little fringe of hair upon his chin; wore no neckcloth; a white hat; a suit of black, long in the sleeves and short in the legs; soiled <b>brown</b> stockings and <b>laced</b> shoes. His complexion, naturally muddy, was rendered muddier by too strict an economy of soap and water; and the same observation will apply to the washable part of his attire, which he might have changed with comfort to himself and gratification to his friends. He was about five and thirty; was crushed and jammed up in a heap, under the shade of a large green cotton umbrella; and ruminated over his tobacco-plug like a cow.|$|R
60|$|She dressed {{generally}} {{in a white}} frock, with a skirt of walking length, showing her neat, <b>laced,</b> <b>brown</b> boots. If there was any colour about her costume {{it was just a}} bit of blue perhaps. No exertion seemed to distress her. I have seen her land from the dinghy after a long pull in the sun (she rowed herself about a good deal) with no quickened breath and not a single hair out of its place. In the morning when she came out on the verandah for the first look westward, Sumatra way, over the sea, she seemed as fresh and sparkling as a dewdrop. But a dewdrop is evanescent, and there was nothing evanescent about Freya. I remember her round, solid arms with the fine wrists, and her broad, capable hands with tapering fingers.|$|R
2500|$|In 1997, {{the entire}} Boot Camp came {{together}} {{for the release of}} their first group album, For the People. Unlike Nocturnal and Da Storm, which used Da Beatminerz sparingly, on For the People the group completely abandoned them, and strayed away from their grimy, sample-heavy basement sound. Instead, Boogie <b>Brown</b> and Buckshot <b>laced</b> the album with live instrumentation production. The new sound did not go over well with fans or critics, causing the album to receive lukewarm reviews and disappointing sales. Instead of only focusing on the core Camp members, the album showcased a wide number of the group's affiliates like Illa Noyz and the Representativz, and also featured debut appearances from BJ Swan, LS, The BTJ's and F.L.O.W. The album's lead single, [...] "Headz Are Reddee Pt. 2" [...] b/w [...] "Down by Law" [...] failed to reach any Billboard singles chart.|$|R
60|$|You realize, then, {{how great}} and how terrible was {{the purpose of}} this maid of twenty-five, who so demurely took her seat in the Paris {{diligence}} on that July morning of the Year 2 of the Republic--1793, old style. She was becomingly dressed in <b>brown</b> cloth, a <b>lace</b> fichu folded across her well-developed breast, a conical hat above her light brown hair. She was of a good height and finely proportioned, and her carriage as full of dignity as of grace. Her skin was of such white loveliness that a contemporary compares it with the lily. Like Athene, she was gray-eyed, and, like Athene, noble-featured, the oval of her face squaring a little at the chin, in which there was a cleft. Calm was her habit, calm her slow-moving eyes, calm and deliberate her movements, and calm the mind reflected in all this.|$|R
