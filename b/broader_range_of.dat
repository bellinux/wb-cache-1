5|$|Farmer {{worked in}} Los Angeles {{for a time}} as a hotel janitor and a {{hospital}} file clerk, before joining Lionel Hampton's orchestra in 1952. He toured Europe with the orchestra, and shared the organization's trumpet chairs with Clifford Brown, Quincy Jones and Benny Bailey. This aided his musical development considerably, as did his 1953 membership of Teddy Charles' New Directions band – the compositions he encountered in this band allowed him to consider a <b>broader</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> expression during improvisation.|$|E

5|$|An {{improved}} {{mathematical analysis}} of Cassini data by astrophysicists Matthew Holman and Matthew Payne tightened the constraints on possible locations of Planet Nine. Holman and Payne developed {{a more efficient}} model {{that allowed them to}} explore a <b>broader</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> parameters than the previous analysis. The parameters identified using this technique to analyze the Cassini data was then intersected with Batygin and Brown's dynamical constraints on Planet Nine's orbit. Holman and Payne concluded that Planet Nine is most likely to be located within 20° of RA = 40°, Dec = −15°, in an area of the sky near the constellation Cetus.|$|E
5|$|Fluor {{was founded}} in 1912 by John Simon Fluor as Fluor Construction Company. It grew quickly, {{predominantly}} by building oil refineries, pipelines and other facilities for {{the oil and gas}} industry, at first in California, and then in the Middle East and globally. In the late 1960s, it began diversifying into oil drilling, coal mining and other raw materials like lead. A global recession in {{the oil and gas industry}} and losses from its mining operation led to restructuring and layoffs in the 1980s. Fluor sold its oil operations and diversified its construction work into a <b>broader</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> services and industries.|$|E

5|$|The April/May 2007 edition {{featured}} the magazine's first all-new design in almost seventy-five years. During {{the next few}} years, Weird Tales published works by {{a wide range of}} strange-fiction authors including Michael Moorcock and Tanith Lee, as well as newer writers such as Jay Lake, Cat Rambo, and Rachel Swirsky. The period also saw the addition of a <b>broader</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> content, ranging from narrative essays to comics to features on weird culture. The magazine won its first Hugo Award in August 2009, in the semiprozine category, two Hugo Award nominations in subsequent years, and its first World Fantasy Award nomination, for editors Segal and Vandermeer, in more than seventeen years.|$|E
5|$|The Redskins {{controversy}} began receiving {{more attention}} in 2013, {{starting with a}} symposium in February on the topic at the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. Subsequently, the Oneida Indian Nation of New York sponsored a series of radio ads in each city to coincide with games of the 2013 season, each featuring a targeted message. A <b>broader</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> persons spoke in favor of change or open discussion, including local government leaders, members of Congress, and President Barack Obama. Statements {{in support of a}} name change by civil rights and religious organizations were added to those that Native American groups have been making for decades.|$|E
5|$|Uropathogenic E. coli {{from the}} gut {{is the cause}} of 80–85% of community-acquired urinary tract infections, with Staphylococcus saprophyticus being the cause in 5–10%. Rarely they may be due to viral or fungal infections. Healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (mostly related to urinary catheterization) involve a much <b>broader</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> {{pathogens}} including: E. coli (27%), Klebsiella (11%), Pseudomonas (11%), the fungal pathogen Candida albicans (9%), and Enterococcus (7%) among others. Urinary tract infections due to Staphylococcus aureus typically occur secondary to blood-borne infections. Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium can infect the urethra but not the bladder. These infections are usually classified as a urethritis rather than urinary tract infection.|$|E

5|$|Children with RAD are {{presumed to}} have grossly {{disturbed}} internal working models of relationships {{that may lead}} to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, and {{there is a lack of}} clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years. However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the Cold War in the early-1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late-1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a <b>broader</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos {{have become}} a {{standard}} knockdown tool in animal embryonic systems, which have a <b>broader</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> gene expression than adult cells and can be strongly affected by an off-target interaction. Following initial injections into frog or fish embryos at the single-cell or few-cell stages, Morpholino effects can be measured up to five days later, after most of the processes of organogenesis and differentiation are past, with observed phenotypes consistent with target-gene knockdown. Control oligos with irrelevant sequences usually produce no change in embryonic phenotype, evidence of the Morpholino oligo's sequence-specificity and lack of non-antisense effects. The dose required for a knockdown can be reduced by coinjection of several Morpholino oligos targeting the same mRNA, which is an effective strategy for reducing or eliminating dose-dependent off-target RNA interactions.|$|E
5|$|Punic, the Semitic {{language}} of the Carthaginians, continued {{to be used in}} North Africa during the Imperial period. Before the Roman conquest in 146 BC, nearly all Punic inscriptions had been votives to the deities Tanit and Ba'al or funerary commemorations, but during the Roman era a <b>broader</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> content is found in Neo-Punic, often appearing with parallel texts in Latin or Greek. A striking occurrence of Neo-Punic is found at the otherwise thoroughly Roman temple of Roma and Augustus, built 14–19 AD at Leptis Magna. One of the latest Neo-Punic inscriptions on a monument dates to the reign of Domitian (81–96 AD). No inscription in Punic script on stone can be dated later than the 2nd or 3rd century. Latin script was used to write Punic in the 4th and 5th centuries.|$|E

5|$|The {{importance}} of the manufacture of iron goods to Birmingham's economy was recognised as early as 1538, and grew rapidly as the century progressed. Equally significant was the town's emerging role as a centre for the iron merchants who organised finance, supplied raw materials and traded and marketed the industry's products. By the 1600s Birmingham formed the commercial hub {{of a network of}} forges and furnaces stretching from South Wales to Cheshire and its merchants were selling finished manufactured goods as far afield as the West Indies. These trading links gave Birmingham's metalworkers access to much wider markets, allowing them to diversify away from lower-skilled trades producing basic goods for local sale, towards a <b>broader</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> specialist, higher-skilled and more lucrative activities.|$|E
