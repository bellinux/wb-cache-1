5000|$|In 2002 {{and early}} 2003, <b>Bush</b> <b>Telegraph</b> {{listeners}} voted on {{production of a}} cotton crop.https://web.archive.org/web/20121023172445/http://www.abc.net.au/rural/grow/default.htm ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} favourably {{received}} by music critics at the time, {{save for a}} curiously critical review in Record Mirror, which appears to criticise the album (and Bush herself), while complimenting a number of tracks. Based largely on this album, Bush was voted [...] "Best female artist of 1980" [...] in polls taken in Melody Maker, Capital Radio, Sounds and the Sunday <b>Telegraph.</b> <b>Bush</b> herself {{has said that it}} was her favourite album to date. More recently, AllMusic gave the album a favourable review, complimenting the three singles most highly but said that Bush would improve on the formula on later albums.|$|R
60|$|A {{week before}} Christmas Day, 1870, {{the little town}} of Genoa, in the State of New York, exhibited, perhaps more {{strongly}} than at any other time, the bitter irony of its founders and sponsors. A driving snowstorm that had whitened every windward hedge, <b>bush,</b> wall, and <b>telegraph</b> pole, played around this soft Italian Capital, whirled {{in and out of the}} great staring wooden Doric columns of its post office and hotel, beat upon the cold green shutters of its best houses, and powdered the angular, stiff, dark figures in its streets. From the level of the street, the four principal churches of the town stood out starkly, even while their misshapen spires were kindly hidden in the low, driving storm. Near the railroad station, the new Methodist chapel, whose resemblance to an enormous locomotive was further heightened by the addition of a pyramidal row of front steps, like a cowcatcher, stood as if waiting for a few more houses to be hitched on to proceed to a pleasanter location. But the pride of Genoa--the great Crammer Institute for Young Ladies--stretched its bare brick length and reared its cupola plainly from the bleak Parnassian hill above the principal avenue. There was no evasion in the Crammer Institute of the fact that it was a public institution. A visitor upon its doorsteps, a pretty face at its window, were clearly visible all over the township.|$|R

50|$|Cardwell <b>Bush</b> <b>Telegraph</b> is a {{heritage}}-listed former {{post office}} and now heritage centre at 53 Victoria Street, Cardwell, Cassowary Coast Region, Queensland, Australia. The Telegraph and Post Office at Cardwell was designed by Colonial Architect's Office and built in 1870 by George McCallum, {{making it one of}} the oldest buildings in North Queensland.|$|E
50|$|Responding to 2014 Liberal Government {{budget cuts}} of $254 million over 5 years, Mark Scott axed ABC Radio National program <b>Bush</b> <b>Telegraph</b> and five {{regional}} radio outposts. In a senate inquiry about the cuts, Scott rejected claims that ABC management {{was using the}} Abbott Government's cuts {{as an excuse to}} pursue unpopular cost-saving initiatives.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the lack}} of development, the {{government}} established a number of services in Cardwell, thereby becoming the main industry in the town and guaranteeing its continued existence. By the mid 1870s a pilot's quarters, police barracks and lock-up, a Lands Office, combined Court/Customs House, Telegraph Office (now the Cardwell <b>Bush</b> <b>Telegraph),</b> sub-collector's (of customs) residence and provisional school existed at Cardwell.|$|E

5000|$|In May 2014 Rick Brewster opined, [...] "I don't {{think it}} will ever be solved because too many people put their hand up and said 'I started it' and we don't believe any of it. We just think it's funny, it's the <b>bush</b> <b>telegraph</b> really. The whole country was doing it and then we found when we went {{overseas}} the people in America were doing it too." ...|$|E
50|$|The JC Hubinger Memorial Library also {{functioned as}} a museum, and the local Returned and Services League used the stage area for a display of memorabilia and photographs. Cardwell's former {{courthouse}} and 1907 lock-up were relocated {{to the rear of}} the former divisional hall by 2003. The library moved to a new location in Balliol Street in 2008, but the hall continued to function as a museum within the Cardwell <b>Bush</b> <b>Telegraph</b> Heritage Centre, which includes the former courthouse, lock-up and Post and Telegraph Office. The hall was also used for the annual ANZAC Day dawn service until it was heavily damaged by Cyclone Yasi in February 2011.|$|E
50|$|The Cardwell Divisional Board Hall was {{originally}} constructed in 1892 and is located within an early government precinct on Victoria Street, Cardwell. Very few purpose-built divisional board halls or offices survive in Queensland. The timber building became the Cardwell Shire Hall in 1903, and a marble honour board was added in 1922. After the Cardwell Shire Council's administrative functions moved to Tully in 1929 {{the hall was}} used by the Queensland Country Women's Association (QCWA) and later the Returned Sailors' Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia (RSSAILA) before becoming a library from 1989-2008. It is now part of the Cardwell <b>Bush</b> <b>Telegraph</b> Heritage Centre and is called the JC Hubinger Museum.|$|E
50|$|Securing {{food for}} {{aboriginal}} nomads {{was always a}} dicey business, and the attraction of areas where Europeans settled, as places where, through kinship with indigenous people employed there, one could obtain surer supplies of food, tobacco and sugar, exercised a powerful influence on tribal shifts in Australia. Around the 1900s, taken in by <b>Bush</b> <b>Telegraph</b> rumours of marvels to be seen at a new gold mine, which had begun to operate at :sv:Fletchers Gully Mine southwards {{in what is now}} the Victoria Daly Region they moved there together with the Wagiman, and never looked back to return to their homeland. According to Johannes Falkenberg, one horde of the tribe, known as the Ngargaminjin, assimilated with the Murrinh-Partha after the coming of white colonization.|$|E
5000|$|Early in 2007 she {{returned}} to Melbourne to finalise her debut album, Home Brew, which had tracks recorded in Alice Springs, Darwin, Melbourne and Sydney. She issued a single, [...] "Air to Me", ahead of the album, in March and followed with a tour. The Dwarf website's Elyse Stoupe felt that her [...] "voice sounds close to that of Missy Higgins, if only a tad bit raspier, making it that much more interesting. It's a quite a bouncy song, with a strong bass line and use of imaginative sound effects". In the following month Rolling Stone Australia described her style as [...] "post trip-hop", and provided a give-away CD, Rolling Stone Supports JB Seed Artists, with tracks by Various Artists including [...] "Air to Me" [...] by Tecoma. She was interviewed by Michael Mackenzie for Radio National's <b>Bush</b> <b>Telegraph</b> and played her single, live.|$|E

At the Country Music Awards of Australia for 1998 he won 'Top Selling Album' for Pipe Dream. [...] "Sir Don", his tribute to cricketer Donald Bradman, is on the album. Williamson performed [...] "Raining on the Rock" [...] as a duet with Warren H Williams. The following year, at the Australian Country Music Awards, the pair won 'Collaboration of the Year'. Williamson soon took part in his short-lived television series on the Seven Network called The <b>Bush</b> <b>Telegraph.</b> Following this for a moderate period, Williamson continued touring Australia and was also releasing a series of compilations. In July 1999 his album, The Way It Is, appeared, which reached No. 10, it went gold after eight weeks. By {{the end of the}} decade Williamson became better known in the United States, United Kingdom and New Zealand. Also in 1999, he published his first calendar, by using photography from Steve Parish.|$|E

40|$|A ""bush telegraph"" is an antipodean slang {{noun phrase}} for a ""grapevine"" or an {{informal}} network of communication. The {{title of this}} book on English language use {{comes from the fact}} that the book is written from the southern hemisphere (where the idea of a ""bush telegraph"" is more widely-known) and because the concept of a ""bush telegraph"" describes what the book provides - a discussion of salient points in English language use and tertiary teaching across branches of interrelated interests.
