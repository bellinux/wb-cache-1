40|$|Central {{shrinkage}} crack {{is a common}} defect encountered in steel ingot casting. It is necessary to limit the degree of crack in case of further propagation in forging. A 234 -t steel ingot was dissected to check the internal quality, and a central {{shrinkage crack}} band of 1, 400 mm in height and 120 mm in width, was found {{at a distance of}} 450 mm under the riser bottom line. Then, thermo-mechanical simulation using an elasto-viscoplastic finite-element model was conducted to analyze the stress-strain evolution during ingot solidification. A new criterion considering mush mechanical property in the <b>brittle</b> <b>temperature</b> range as well as shrinkage porosity was used to identify the shrinkage crack potential, where the degree of shrinkage porosity is regarded as a probability factor using a modified sigmoid function.

40|$|Semisolid thixoforming is an {{intermediate}} process between casting and forging. This process presents several advantages, such as energy efficiency, production rates, smooth die filling, low shrinkage porosity, which together lead to near net shape capability {{and thus to}} fewer manufacturing steps than with classical methods. So far, there are only few applications of semisolid processing of higher melting point alloys. Steel is a particularly challenging material to semi-solid process {{because of the high}} temperatures involved (about 1410 °C). At present, the ability to form steel components in semi-solid state depends on the control of the flow of material during the forming and defects conditions. Semi-solid alloys display thixotropy, which is characterized by time-dependent behavior which drastically changes from a solid like behavior at rest to a liquid like flow when submitted to shear. However, characterizing and modelling such a behaviour for steels is still challenging.   Ascometal has developed the C 38 LTT (Low Thixoforging Temperature) that is compatible with identified parameters [1] to be suitable for thixoforming: the solidus and liquidus temperatures (TS and TL) have to be as low as possible; the temperature at 50 % liquid fraction (T 50 %) has to be as low as possible; the melting interval (TL-TS) has to be as large as possible; and the slope at 10 % and 50 % liquid fraction must be as low as possible to ensure a small sensitivity of liquid fraction to temperature.   The aim of the research work was to study the rheological properties of C 38 LTT. The high temperature range for semi-solid state makes the experiments particularly challenging. An experimental protocol was determined, geometries of specimens, minimize thermal gradients and optical system to improve the precision of measuring temperature (figure 1) with a Gleeble simulator to characterize the thermomechanical behaviors.   Uniaxial tensile and compressive tests were carried out on semi-solid specimen having > 0. 8 solid fraction for different ram speeds and temperatures. The constitutive behavior appears greatly dependent on both fraction solid and strain rate. Furthermore, while the behavior is dominated by the solid phase, the variation in both ductility and stress with temperature has been identified to propose a <b>brittle</b> <b>temperature</b> range and the influence of the temperature on the thermomechanical behavior. Specifically, in tension, a drastic change in ductility with fraction solid/temperature was found in good agreement with some results for aluminum <b>brittle</b> <b>temperature</b> range in literature [2]. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the future}} fusion devices, ELMs-induced {{transient}} heat flux {{may lead to}} the surface cracking of tungsten (W) based plasma-facing materials (PFMs). In theory, the cracking is related to the material fracture toughness and the thermal stress-strain caused by transient heat flux. In this paper, a finite element model was successfully built to realize a theoretical semi infinite space. The temperature and stress-strain distribution as well as evolution of W during a single heating-cooling cycle of transient heat flux were simulated and analyzed. It showed that the generation of plastic deformation during the <b>brittle</b> <b>temperature</b> range between room temperature and DBTT (ductile to brittle transition temperature, ∼ 400  °C) caused the cracking of W during the cooling phase. The cracking threshold for W under transient heat flux was successfully obtained by finite element analysis, to some extent, in consistent with the similar experimental results. Both the heat flux factors (FHF = P·t 0. 5) and the maximum surface temperatures at cracking thresholds were almost invariant for the transient heat fluxes with different pulse widths and temporal distributions. This method not only identified the theoretical conclusion but also obtained the detail values for W with actual temperature-dependent properties...|$|E

Therefore, the weldability of Waspaloy® and Haynes® 282 ® have been evaluated using the Varestraint weldability test. The experiments reveal that Waspaloy® has a higher susceptibility to hot cracking compared to Haynes® 282 ®. This conclusion is supported by increased total crack length (10 mm or more) and larger <b>brittle</b> <b>temperature</b> range (approx. 65 °C) for Waspaloy® when compared to Haynes® 282 ® in Varestraint and Gleeble hot ductility tests, respectively. The cracking in Haynes® 282 ® seems to be connected with a secondary phase which presumably can be associated with Ti-Mo based MC-type carbide observed in the fusion zone. Also, a surrounding segregated area is present near this secondary phase as well as along the grain boundaries. Furthermore, micro-Vickers hardness results revealed {{more or less the same}} weld metal hardness (260 - 280 HV) but a difference in the base metal hardness.

40|$|P 91 is a {{new kind}} of {{heat-resistant}} and high-tensile steel. It can be extruded after ingot casting and can be widely used for different pipes in power plants. However, due to its mushy freezing characteristics, a lack of feeding in the ingot center often generates many defects, such as porosity and crack. A six-ton P 91 ingot was cast and sliced, and a representative part of the longitudinal section was inspected in more detail. The morphology of crack-like defects was examined by X-ray high energy industrial CT and reconstructed by 3 D software. There are five main portions of defects larger than 200 mm 3, four of which are interconnected. These initiated from continuous liquid film, and then were torn apart by excessive tensile stress within the <b>brittle</b> <b>temperature</b> range (BTR). The 3 D FEM analysis of thermo-mechanical simulation was carried out to analyze the formation of porosity and internal crack defects. The results of shrinkage porosity and Niyama values revealed that the center of the ingot suffers from inadequate feeding. Several criteria based on thermal and mechanical models were used to evaluate the susceptibility of hot crack formation. The Clyne and Davies’ criterion and Katgerman’s criterion successfully predicted the high hot crack susceptibility in the ingot center. Six typical locations in the longitudinal section had been chosen for analysis of the stresses and strains evolution during the BTR. Locations in the defects region showed the highest tensile stresses and relative high strain values, while other locations showed either low tensile stresses or low strain values. In conclusion, hot crack develops only when stress and strain exceed a threshold value at the same time during the BTR...|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} {{effect of the}} degradation by radiation in steels and welds is the decrease in their ductility.

The results are compared with the values previously obtained by thermo-electric and magnetic Barkhausen measurements and with the results of Charpy impact destructive testing.

40|$|Small {{additions}} {{of boron}} {{were shown to}} improve the room temperature ductility of the intermetallic compound Ni 3 Al. Boron is believed to segregate to the gain boundaries and strengthen them, allowing the inheret ductility of the grains to be achieved.

40|$|Hot {{cracking}} is {{a problem}} in welding 2195 aluminum-lithium alloy. Weld wire additives seem to reduce the problem. This study proposes a model intended to clarify the way alloying elements affect hot-cracking. The <b>brittle</b> <b>temperature</b> range of an alloy extends wherever the tensile stress required to move the meniscus of the liquid film at the grain/dendrite boundaries is less than the bulks flow stress Sigma(sub B) of the grains: 2 gamma/delta <= sigma(sub B) + P where gamma is boundary film surface tension delta= boundary film thickness P = gas pressure (Some alloys outgas.) If the above condition is not met, the grains deform under stress and the liquid film remains in place. Curves of 2 gamma/delta and sigma(sub B) vs. temperature in the range just below the melting temperature determine the hot cracking susceptibility of an alloy. Both are zero at onset of solidification. sigma(sub B) rises as the thermal activation of the slip mechanism is reduced. 2 gamma/delta rises as the film thickness delta which can be estimated from the Scheil equation, drops. But, given an embrittled alloy, whether the alloy actually cracks is determined by the strain imposed upon it in the embrittled condition. A critical strain is estimated, Epsilon(sub C) on the order of Epsilon(sub C) is approximately delta/l where L = grain size and where the the volume increment due to the strain, concentrated at the liquid film, is on the order of the liquid film volume. In the early 80 's an empirical critical strain cracking envelope Epsilon(sub C) (T) was incorporated into a damage criterion to estimate the effect of welding parameters on the formation of microfissures in a superalloy with good results. These concepts, liquid film decoherence vs. grain bulk deformation and critical strain, form the key elements of a quantitative theory of hot-cracking applicable for assessing the effect of alloying elements on hot-cracking during welding...|$|E
40|$|With {{advances}} in commercially available finite element software and computational capability, engineers can now model large-scale problems in mechanics, heat transfer, fluid flow, and electromagnetics as never before. With these enhancements in capability, {{it is increasingly}} tempting to include the fundamental process physics to help achieve greater accuracy (Refs. 1 - 7). While this goal is laudable, it adds complication and drives up cost and computational requirements. Practical analysis of welding relies on simplified user inputs to derive important relativistic trends in desired outputs such as residual stress or distortion due to changes in inputs like voltage, current, and travel speed. Welding is a complex three-dimensional phenomenon. The question becomes how much modeling detail is needed to accurately predict relative trends in distortion, residual stress, or weld cracking? In this work, a HAZ (Heat Affected Zone) weld-cracking problem was analyzed to rank two different welding cycles (weld speed varied) in terms of crack susceptibility. Figure 1 shows an aerospace casting GTA welded to a wrought skirt. The essentials of part geometry, welding process, and tooling were suitably captured lo model the strain excursion in the HAZ over a crack-susceptible temperature range, and the weld cycles were suitably ranked. The main contribution of this work is the demonstration of a practical methodology by which engineering solutions to engineering problems may be obtained through weld modeling when time and resources are extremely limited. Typically, welding analysis suffers with the following unknowns: material properties over entire temperature range, the heat-input source term, and environmental effects. Material properties of interest are conductivity, specific heat, latent heat, modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield strength, ultimate strength, and possible rate dependencies. Boundary conditions are conduction into fixturing, radiation and convection to the environment, and any mechanical constraint. If conductivity, for example, is only known at a few temperatures it can be linearly extrapolated from the highest known temperature to the liquidus temperature. Over the liquidus to solidus temperature the conductivity is linearly increased {{by a factor of}} three to account for the enhanced heat transfer due to convection in the weld pool. Above the liquidus it is kept constant. Figure 2 shows an example of this type of approximation. Other thermal and mechanical properties and boundary conditions can be similarly approximated, using known physical material characteristics when possible. Sensitivity analysis can show that many assumptions have a small effect on the final outcome of the analysis. In the example presented in this work, simplified analysis procedures were used to model this process to understand why one set of parameters is superior to the other. From Lin (Ref. 8), mechanical strain is expected to drive HAZ cracking. Figure 3 shows a plot of principal tensile mechanical strain versus temperature during the welding process. By looking at the magnitudes of the tensile mechanical strain in the material's <b>Brittle</b> <b>Temperature</b> Region (BTR), {{it can be seen that}} on a relative basis the faster travel speed process that causes cracking results in about three times the strain in the temperature range of the BTR. In this work, a series of simplifying assumptions were used in order to quickly and accurately model a real welding process to respond to an immediate manufacturing need. The analysis showed that the driver for HAZ cracking, the mechanical strain in the BTR, was significantly higher in the process that caused cracking versus the process that did not. The main emphasis of the analysis was to determine whether there was a mechanical reason whether the improved weld parameters would consistently produce an acceptable weld, The prediction of the mechanical strain magnitudes confirms the better process...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays a vast {{majority}} of the steel produced worldwide is via the continuous casting process route because this is the most low-cost, efficient and high quality method to mass produce metal products in a variety of sizes and shapes. Most of the continuous casters are the initial manufacturing step of a product which is very close to the final shape, reducing the need for further finishing. During continuous casting the liquid steel is solidified under controlled conditions of heat extraction to a semi-finished product that can subsequently be processed until final shape is reached. However, there is no perfect process and cracking during solidification of continuously cast steel slabs {{has been one of the}} main problems in casting for many years. In literature many terms are used for the phenomenon of crack formation at temperatures close to the solidus temperature, e. g. hot tearing, hot shortness, hot cracking or solidification cracking. Regardless of the name, hot tears represent a failure that occurs during casting in the regions of a solidifying slab that are at temperatures between solidus (TS) and liquidus (TL) and are subjected to simultaneously acting tensile and compressive stresses. The three steel grades considered in this study are a Low carbon aluminium killed (LCAK) steel grade, a high strength low alloyed (HSLA) steel grade, micro-alloyed with extra additions of vanadium, nitrogen and niobium, and a low-range HSLA (LR-HSLA), with the same concentration of niobium but a lower concentration of vanadium and nitrogen. The purpose of this study has been to investigate the differences between these three steel grades, with respect to hot tearing sensitivity upon solidifying in a thin slab caster. This research originates from the industrial demand for defect-free high-speed casting of steels and this thesis focuses on the thermo-mechanical behaviour of steel grades in relation to the solidification conditions in the continuous casting mould. Although these steel grades are not very different in chemical composition, thermodynamic calculations showed that the two HSLA steel grades have different propensity to the peritectic reaction upon solidification due to the combination of elements in the chemical composition that are either ferrite or austenite stabilisers. In order to better understand the special behaviour of the HSLA grade, compared with the LR-HSLA and the potential precipitation of TiN, phase field microstructure simulations have been performed, showing that TiN can form already during the latest stage of solidification, even when very low amounts of this element are present. If TiN particles trigger the coalescence of dendrite trunks, then it is possible to understand why, for a given Ti content an increased N content present in the HSLA grade can help to reduce the risk of hot tearing. Segregating elements in steel can influence the hot tearing susceptibility as they can widen the <b>brittle</b> <b>temperature</b> range (?TB), displacing its lower limit to lower temperatures. Unique hot tensile tests were carried out in the temperature range involving solidification, where the results suggest that among the studied steel grades, the LCAK steel grade has the lowest strength during solidification and a broader ?TB. Fractographic studies of the samples fractures above the non-equilibrium solidus revealed low melting phases even at temperatures as low as 1360 ºC. These low-melting films do have an effect on the hot tearing behaviour of commercial steel grades. The LCAK is particularly prone to develop non-metallic particles at the last stages of solidification. Whilst the study with the Mould Cracking Simulator did not confirm the increased hot tearing susceptibility of the LCAK and LR-HSLA, it did partially substantiate that the modifications on its design are novel in the way that no other physical model of cracking during continuous casting is able to simulate the process in such a way that it resembles the industrial process. Despite the alloys tested during the first few experiments were not the same alloy compositions studied in this thesis, the results of the Mould Cracking Simulator are very promising. It is expected that this new physical model will help in the study of the thermomechanical properties of commercial steels motivated by the continuous trend towards improved casting productivity by increasing casting speed and higher quality, as well as for the development of new steel grades.

40|$|Direct-chill (DC) casting {{is one of}} {{the most}} common methods to produce ingots of {{high-strength}} aluminum alloys such as an AA 7050. Despite of its superior mechanical properties, this alloy is prone to both hot tearing (HT) and cold cracking (CC) during DC casting. HT form above the solidus while CC occurs below the solidus temperature. CC occurrence appears to be random and thus it is difficult to foresee. Moreover, the propagation of CC is usually catastrophic. Thus, not only it decreases the yield of the production and may damage the casting equipments, but it also poses safety hazard to the casting personnel. A previous study on CC indicated this type of crack could start from a solidification defect, for example an inclusion. The same study also suggested that undeveloped or micro hot tear (HT) may also act as CC initiation point but this assumption has not yet being proven. In addition to trials and errors methods, numerical models are more and more considered as relevant tools to find process conditions minimizing the risk of both HT and CC. At the moment, we have a numerical process simulator to simulate aluminium DC-casting process, called ALSIM. Although at its current version (ALSIM 6), ALSIM has criteria to estimate the susceptibility for both HT and CC, it was reported that ALSIM’s crack prediction capability has not yet reached its full potential. Therefore, the main goal of this study is four-fold: (1) Verify the connection between HT and CC experimentally. (2) Complete ALSIM materials database for AA 7050 for a better crack prediction accuracy. (3) Analyze ALSIM model sensitivity with respect to different DC casting parameters and materials database. (4) Propose a concept of a new crack prediction criterion so that ALSIM could capture the connection between HT and CC quantitatively. Before developing the connection between HT and CC within ALSIM, we need to make sure that the current version of ALSIM is able to properly estimate the susceptibility of different types of cracks during DC casting. For this validation, we performed benchmark tests between trial casts that produce different cast output (healthy, HT and CC) and ALSIM simulations that mimic those trial casts. For obtaining different cast outputs, we vary two casting parameters; casting speed (in combination with cooling rate) and melt inlet geometry. The analysis shows the output of the ALSIM simulation is in qualitative agreement with the experimental results of the trial DC casting. This verifies that ALSIM is sensitive with respect to different casting parameters. Moreover, the results also indicate that ALSIM has the potential to capture the connection between HT and CC. ALSIM uses a set of material properties database to simulate the DC casting process. One of the ALSIM drawbacks in the beginning of the project was the incompleteness of the AA 7050 mechanical properties database in the vicinity of the solidus point (T = 465 °C). To complete this database, we performed isothermal tensile tests in both the sub-solidus temperature regime (between 400 and 465 °C) and in the super-solidus temperature regime (when the material is in its semi-solid state but already possesses mechanical strength), i. e. between solid fraction of 0. 85 and 1. 0 (fully solid). We fitted the result of the tensile tests in respective temperature regimes with the constitutive models implemented in ALSIM to obtain the material property parameters. The focus was on the tensile behavior of the alloy as this loading mode is the main one for the HT formation in the billet. The tensile test results also reveal the mechanical behavior and the failure mechanisms of AA 7050 around the solidus point and shed some light on the possible mechanisms of the connection between HT and CC. In the sub-solidus temperature range, we performed tensile tests at different temperature points (400, 420, 440, 450, 455, 460, 465 °C) and three strain rates (0. 05, 0. 005, 0. 0005 s- 1). For each combination of temperature and strain rate, we repeated the tests three times to capture the statistical behavior of the alloy at the test condition. From the test result, we found that the ductility of the alloy decreases as temperature and strain-rate increases. Meanwhile, the strength of the alloy increases with strain rate but it decreases as temperature increases. From the fracture surface assessment, we observed that the main mode of failure gradually changes from ductile transgranular (at 400 °C) to ductile intergranular (at 465 °C). In the sub-solidus temperature range, we fitted the tensile constitutive behavior data with both extended-Ludwik equation and creep-law. For the former fit, we found that the obtained constitutive parameters are continuous with the data from the lower temperature regime (room temperature up to 400 °C) while for the latter fit, we found that the AA 7050 parameters are relatively comparable to the value of other 7 XXX series alloys. In the super-solidus temperature range, we performed tensile test at different solid-fractions (fs); 0. 85, 0. 88, 0. 9, 0. 94, 0. 97, 0. 99 and 1. 0 (fully solid) or in terms of temperature at 550, 520, 485, 475, 473, 470 and 465 respectively. To observe the displacement-rate sensitivity, we did tests at two different displacement rates (0. 2 and 2. 0 mm/min) for some solid fractions. To assess the statistical behavior of the alloy, for each test conditions, we repeated the test three times. The results show that grain coalescence starts between solid fraction of 0. 94 and 0. 97. This occurrence is signified by the steep increase in the peak stress as solid fraction increases. The alloy undergoes a typical <b>brittle</b> <b>temperature</b> range behavior – transition from ductile-brittle-ductile as the solid fraction decreases from the fully solid state, with the lowest ductility observed at fs = 0. 94. The fracture mode observed from fracture surface analysis is generally mixed between transgranular and interdendritic. We extracted the constitutive parameters by comparing the tensile force-displacement curves obtained from the experimental tensile tests and the result from numerical thermo-mechanical tensile tests that were built using ALSIM. Using this method, we selected the constitutive parameters that provide a good fit of the force value between numerical and experimental tensile tests in this temperature range. From the fitting, we found that the semi-solid behavior of AA 7050 is different compared to the other alloys that were already available in ALSIM semi-solid mechanical database; Al- 2 % Cu and AA 5182. We observe that AA 7050 is stronger than Al- 2 % Cu but weaker than AA 5182 in the semi-solid temperature regime. Using the newly obtained AA 7050 materials database, we carried out the sensitivity analysis of ALSIM with respect to different materials database at both temperature regimes (semi-solid and fully-solid). We ran ALSIM simulations using the same set-up as the benchmarking cases but we varied the materials database at different temperature ranges. We assessed the results of both cracking criteria. We conclude that ALSIM model is sensitive with respect to the materials database in both temperature ranges. However, we also found that ALSIM HT criterion has a weak dependency with respect to different materials databases, which is unexpected and shows this criterion needs to be improved. To experimentally validate the connection between HT and CC, we need to produce samples containing undeveloped HT and then quantify the dimension of these HT. To produce these samples, we used a solidification experiment with controlled conditions. During the solidification, we varied two process parameters namely cooling-rate and constrain conditions. We made sure only HT were formed in the sample by relieving the constraining force as soon as the material is fully solidified and let the sample cool down unconstrained to room temperature. Subsequently, we performed three dimensional imaging on the re-solidified and most deformed part of the sample by using X-Ray microtomography technique and analyzed the image data by image analysis method. From the result of the image analysis, we found that by changing these two process parameters, four regimes of HT can be distinguished based on its severity; compressive, micro-HT, macro-HT and complete fracture. Only the samples with micro-HT conditions were selected for the subsequent tests. The produced samples with micro-HT were then tensile tested at room temperature, which is the temperature where CC commonly occurs. The result of tensile tests shows significant drop in strength and ductility of the alloy if micro-HT are present in the sample. This verifies the connection between HT and CC. The result from the quantitative image analysis shows that usually HT do not form individually. Moreover, the geometry of the formed HT is not simple (i. e. branching crack) and the approximate ratio between the longest and shortest crack axis is finite (unlike the penny-shaped geometry). These HT features are not taken into account in the crack initiator geometry of the current ALSIM CC criterion. Therefore, the criterion needs to be improved in order to increase the accuracy of the crack prediction. One of the most important drawbacks in the current ALSIM HT criterion in the framework of connection between HT and CC is that it cannot provide the dimension of the formed HT. This information is crucial for the CC criterion to decide whether crack will occur. Since HT is a non-linear and complex phenomenon, we propose to capture its formation by using a stochastic (probabilistic) model. The new HT model considers the relationship between different physical phenomena during solidification and utilizes ALSIM simulation result (physical fields) as the model input. From the simple example presented in this study, we illustrate the potential of this new approach to provide probable dimension and location of the formed HT. Although further development is necessary to make this model fully operational in ALSIM, the implementation of this new HT model in ALSIM may offer the possibility of quantitative crack prediction of the connection between HT and CC.

The microstructure, critical event of the HAZ formed at various heat inputs (E) were characterized and determined by optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), and cleavage fracture stress &# 963; f was also calculated by ABAQUS software. Based on above systematic analysis, the intrinsic mechanism of ductile-brittle transition for F 460 steel {{heat affected}} zones with different heat inputs were revealed. The results indicate that:with the improvement of heat input, the microstructures in sequence are a minority of lath martensite and massive fine lath bainite, more lath bainite with less granular bainite, more granular bainite with less lath bainite, bulky of granular bainite; and the maximum size of the original austenite grain and bainite packet becomes bigger with the improvement of heat input.
