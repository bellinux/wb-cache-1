25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} strategies for a team is their forecheck. Forechecking is the act of attacking the opposition in their defensive zone. Forechecking {{is an important part of}} the dump and chase strategy (i.e. shooting the puck into the offensive zone and then chasing after it). Each team will use their own unique system but the main ones are: 2–1–2, 1–2–2, and 1–4. The 2–1–2 is the most basic forecheck system where two forwards will go in deep and pressure the opposition's defencemen, the third forward stays high and the two defencemen stay at the blueline. The 1–2–2 is a bit more conservative system where one forward pressures the puck carrier and the other two forwards cover the oppositions' wingers, with the two defencemen staying at the blueline. The 1–4 is the most defensive forecheck system, referred to as the neutral zone trap, where one forward will apply pressure to the puck carrier around the oppositions' blueline and the other 4 players stand <b>basically</b> <b>in</b> a line by their blueline in hopes the opposition will skate into one of them. Another strategy is the left wing lock, which has two forwards pressure the puck and the left wing and the two defencemen stay at the blueline.|$|E

25|$|Between 1976 and 1978, Khanna {{acted in}} five box office hits and in nine films {{that were not}} commercially successful. Seven of the {{unsuccessful}} films were critically acclaimed and have achieved strong cult status over the years among the viewers; these films included Mehbooba, Bundal Baaz, Tyaag, Palkon Ki Chhaon Mein, Naukri, Chakravyuha and Janta Hawaldar, which were directed by Shakti Samanta, Shammi Kapoor, Din Dayal Sharma, Meraj, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Basu Chatterjee and Mehmood Ali, respectively. Khanna persuaded Samanta to cast his sister-in-law Simple Kapadia opposite him in Anurodh. Films starring Rajesh Khanna and directed by Shakti Samanta tended to be commercially successful, but Mehbooba was an exception. The change from romantic and social movies to action oriented multi-starrers caused some decline of Khanna's career in terms of box office ratings. The declaration of emergency in India had angered the masses and this helped films having the lead character revolting against corruption to become successes. Actor Joy Mukherjee made Chhailla Babu, a suspense thriller in 1977, which became the only successful film of his as a director, and the unexpected success of Chhailla Babu gave a boost to the career of Khanna. However, Khanna continued <b>basically</b> <b>in</b> solo-hero socialy sober household meaningful films during this era and played a variety of characters in films of various genres.

500|$|Drummer Butch Vig {{stated that}} the album is a [...] "much simpler record than Version 2.0": [...] "All of the songs sort of came from us playing live downstairs [...] with guitar, bass and drums ... That was the only {{conscious}} decision we made – to make the songs simpler. Some of the songs are still layered in spots; compared to the last record, there're about half as many tracks. As far as sounds go, it's basically drums, bass, some heavy guitars and Shirley singing." [...] Erikson agreed that a more organic sound and simplistic approach with respect to production is embodied by the final mix of the album. [...] "A lot of songs took shape {{in just a few}} hours as opposed to a few months with the last record.Some of the songs obviously took a long time, or we wouldn't have been in the studio for a full year. But a lot of them happened very quickly. 'Silence Is Golden' we recorded <b>basically</b> <b>in</b> three days and it was done. 'So Like a Rose,' for the most part, was recorded in three hours. I think we spent a lot of time just trying to resist adding stuff to [...] Because that was our tendency on the other two records.” On the lyrical content of the songs, Vig remarked that [...] " [...] aren't specifically responses to the industry, but they could be read that way. Shirley has said that, for example, 'Shut Your Mouth' is about all the bullshit that's out there, but it's also a sort of note to self to keep your mouth shut, because she says she's the biggest, most opinionated loudmouth of anyone around. So they work on multiple levels." ...|$|E

In 1937 backbenchers passed a radical banking law that was disallowed by the national government (banking was a federal responsibility). Efforts to control the press were also disallowed.

2500|$|The {{following}} is {{a description of a}} classic goal devaluation experiment (from a Scientific American MIND guest blog post called [...] ) which demonstrates the difference between goal-directed and habitual behavior: A series of elegant experiments conducted by Anthony Dickinson and colleagues in the early 1980s at the University of Cambridge in England clearly exposes the behavioral differences between goal-directed and habitual processes. <b>Basically,</b> <b>in</b> the training phase, a rat was trained to press a lever in order to receive some food. Then, in a second phase, the rat was placed in a different cage without a lever and was given the food, but it was made ill whenever it ate the food. This caused the rat to [...] "devalue" [...] the food, because it associated the food with being ill, without directly associating the action of pressing the lever with being ill. Finally, in the test phase, the rat was placed in the original cage with the lever. (To prevent additional learning, no food was delivered in the test phase.) Rats that had undergone an extensive training phase continued to press the lever in the test phase even though the food was devalued; their behavior was called habitual. Rats that had undergone a moderate training phase did not, and their behavior was called goal-directed. … [...] oal-directed behavior is explained by the rat using an explicit prediction of the consequence, or outcome, of an action to select that action. If the rat wants the food, it presses the lever, because it predicts that pressing the lever will deliver the food. If the food has been devalued, the rat will not press the lever. Habitual behavior is explained by a strong association between an action and the situation from which the action was executed. The rat presses the lever when it sees the lever, not because of the predicted outcome..|$|E
2500|$|After leaving WCW, he {{returned}} to CMLL and began wrestling for CMLL's Japanese affiliate, New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW). In 2001, he adopted the Black Tiger character previously used by Mark Rocco and Eddie Guerrero making him the third person to appear under the mask, which is why he’s generally referred to as Black Tiger III. As Black Tiger, he wrestled several tours with New Japan starting out working a series of matches with the storyline opponent of the Black Tiger, Tiger Mask – in this case Tiger Mask IV. Together with his brother Dr. Wagner Jr. he had an unsuccessful IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship challenge against the team of Jushin Thunder Liger and El Samurai in 2001. During 2003 NJPW began to phase {{out most of the}} Luchadors they had employed over the years and thus Black Tiger III began working regularly in Mexico for CMLL, this marked the first time the gimmick was used {{for a longer period of}} time outside of NJPW. Since the storyline in Mexico was that Black Tiger III was Japanese they could not acknowledge the fact that he and Dr. Wagner, Jr. were in fact brothers (in Japan Black Tiger has until now always been portrayed by a foreigner). He usually ended up as Dr. Wagner Jr.'s back-up but on March 31, 2001, Black Tiger III, Dr. Wagner Jr. and Universo 2000 won the CMLL World Trios Championship from Atlantis, Black Warrior and Mr. Niebla. The team would hold the Trios title for over a year until being unseated on July 9, 2004, by Black Warrior, El Canek and Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. When their father (Dr. Wagner) died on September 12, 2004, Dr. Wagner, Jr. was turned tecnicó (good guy by sympathy but since González was working as Black Tiger III and not publicly acknowledged as the son of Dr. Wagner he remained a rudó (bad guy). Dr. Wagner Jr.'s turn meant that Black Tiger III did not have a partner or a direction, he began working for CMLL’s associate International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) and some of the smaller CMLL shows, <b>basically</b> <b>in</b> a holding pattern. González kept working as Black Tiger even when NJPW introduced Rocky Romero as the latest Black Tiger (Black Tiger IV) but due their working relationship with NJPW, CMLL decided that when González worked for them he needed a different [...] "persona". He was repackaged as [...] "El Bronco" [...] complete with a new mask and promoted as someone new to CMLL. González made his debut as [...] "El Bronco" [...] teaming up with Elektro (who had just jumped from AAA to CMLL) and L.A. Park against the original members of Los Guerreros del Infierno (Último Guerrero, Rey Bucanero, and Tarzan Boy). The match was seen as a letdown as the crowd did not appreciate Elektro and did not buy into the [...] "El Bronco" [...] gimmick and the scheduled rematch was rebooked with Hijo de Lizmark and Místico taking over their roles in the match and González as El Bronco replacing Lizmark Jr. in the 2005 Gran Alternativa tournament where his team lost in the first round. After the Gran Alternativa González only made sporadic CMLL appearances as González. González continued to wrestle as Black Tiger III in IWRG and in other independent Mexican wrestling promotions. On February 4, 2006, González finally gave up the Black Tiger name as he lost a [...] "Lucha de Apuestas" [...] to L.A. Park and was unmasked.
