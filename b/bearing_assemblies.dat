500|$|Two <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies</b> from 15-inch (38-cm) gun turrets {{were bought}} cheaply in 1950; these {{came from the}} World War I battleships HMS Revenge and Royal Sovereign, which were being broken up at the time. The {{bearings}} became the two main altitude rotator bearings of the telescope, with the appropriate parts of the telescope being designed around them. Husband presented the first drawings of the proposed giant, fully steerable radio telescope in 1950. After refinements, these plans were detailed in a [...] "Blue Book", which {{was presented to the}} DSIR on 20 March 1951; the proposal was approved in March 1952.|$|E
50|$|EVA Three (Duration 6 hours, 57 minutes) -- With {{astronaut}} Stephen G. Bowen, Stefanyshyn-Piper completed {{cleaning and}} lubrication {{of all but}} one of the trundle <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies</b> (TBA) on the starboard SARJ. The final TBA was replaced during EVA 4.|$|E
50|$|During the 2004 repainting, {{engineers}} {{discovered that}} the pier 3 bearings (east side of navigation channel) had displaced roughly 11 inches east of their original location {{as a result of}} unexpected movement of that pier (west) towards the main river channel. Hennepin County contracted with Wiss, Janey, Elstner and Associates (WJE) to investigate and report on the cause and extent of damage. The consultant's report concluded that evidence suggested the pier underwent many years, perhaps 50, of creep deflection due to sustained lateral earth pressure at the foundation which was held in check by the <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies</b> ultimate strength was finally overcome sometime in 2004 which allowed the unrestrained and rapid movement of the pier. The structural engineers at WJE were unable to predict the magnitude of future pier displacements.|$|E
25|$|After awakening, the two crews set {{right to}} work {{preparing}} for the mission's third EVA, which began at 18:01 UTC. The entire spacewalk was devoted to completing the cleaning, lubrication, removal and replacement of the trundle <b>bearings</b> <b>assemblies</b> in the starboard SARJ. The final trundle <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly</b> installation was deferred to the fourth EVA, but all other tasks scheduled were accomplished without any issues. Stefanyshyn-Piper's fifth EVA moved her to the twenty-fifth spot in cumulative EVA time with thirty three hours, forty two minutes.|$|R

50|$|The second design {{challenge}} is the <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The bearing surfaces must survive high loads (jump landing) {{and a large}} number of cycles (years of turning), but they must do this in a harsh environment of water, ice and wind, and again the solution must be affordable. The Deuce DES uses stainless steel pins riding in Teflon coated bushings.|$|E
50|$|EVA One (Duration 6 hours, 52 minutes) -- With {{astronaut}} Stephen G. Bowen, Stefanyshyn-Piper transferred {{an empty}} nitrogen tank assembly from ESP3 to the shuttle’s cargo bay, transferred a new flex hose rotary coupler to ESP3 for future use, removed an insulation cover on the Kibo External Facility berthing mechanism, began cleaning and lubrication of the starboard SARJ, and replacement of its 11 trundle <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies.</b>|$|E
40|$|Examination {{revealed}} that misalignment in the <b>assembly</b> of the <b>bearing</b> {{resulted in the}} failure. Evidences suggest that {{the distance between the}} bearing housing and the flange of the shaft was smaller than that of the permissible limit. This has resulted in sliding of the balls on one of the shoulders of the groove of the inner and outer races. Because of this, there was severe stressing of the cage material leading to fracturing of the cage. Once this failure occurred, the balls and the outer race came out of the <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly.</b> No material abnormalities in the <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly</b> were responsible for the failur...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses two reduced-order {{methods to}} {{calculate}} the overall non-linear vibration response of a multi-mode rotor-squeeze film damper (SFD) <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly.</b> Good agreement has been found between their computed results and those calculated by the conventional Runge-Kutta-Merson method (RKMM), yet they require less than 5 per cent of the computing time consumed by the RKMM. They are applied to compute the vibration response, three-dimensional deflection shape and the overall vibrational kinetic energy of the rotor-bearing assembly. The assembly is simulated under various operating conditions including different unbalances, oil viscosities, static misalignments and damper factors. It is concluded that effective vibration control of a flexible rotor-SFD <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly</b> can be achieved when the vertical static eccentricity ratio of the SFD is set to a certain limit...|$|R

50|$|The typical MORGOIL tapered neck <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly</b> {{consists}} of a sleeve with a non-locking tapered bore that facilitates removal of the <b>bearing</b> chock <b>assembly</b> from the roll neck. The sleeve, keyed to the neck to prevent creeping during operation, produces a slight interference fit on the roll neck {{by means of the}} push-up force used to mount the bearing on the roll. The outside diameter of the sleeve is ground and polished serving as the journal surface of the bearing. Sleeve wall thickness variation is controlled to 0.005 mm (0.0002 in.) to minimize roll force variation.|$|R

50|$|The {{operating}} environment and service needs {{are also important}} design considerations. Some <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies</b> require routine addition of lubricants, while others are factory sealed, requiring no further maintenance {{for the life of}} the mechanical assembly. Although seals are appealing, they increase friction, and in a permanently sealed bearing the lubricant may become contaminated by hard particles, such as steel chips from the race or bearing, sand, or grit that gets past the seal. Contamination in the lubricant is abrasive and greatly reduces the operating life of the bearing assembly. Another major cause of bearing failure is the presence of water in the lubrication oil. Online water-in-oil monitors have been introduced in recent years to monitor the effects of both particles and the presence of water in oil and their combined effect.|$|E
50|$|The Alpha joint is {{the main}} rotary joint {{allowing}} the solar arrays to track the sun; in nominal operation the alpha joint rotates by 360° each orbit (however, see also Night Glider mode). One Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ) is located between the P3 and P4 truss segments {{and the other is}} located between the S3 and S4 truss segments. When in operation, these joints continuously rotate to keep the solar array wings on the outboard truss segments oriented towards the Sun. Each SARJ is 10 feet in diameter, weighs approximately 2,500 pounds and can be rotated continuously using <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies</b> and a servo control system. On both the port and starboard sides, all of the power flows through the Utility Transfer Assembly (UTA) in the SARJ. Roll ring assemblies allow transmission of data and power across the rotating interface so it never has to unwind. The SARJ was designed, built and tested by Lockheed Martin and its subcontractors.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{temperature}} of idlers' <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{is the basic}} indicator of their technical condition. The main aim {{of this article is}} to present the impact of decreased tightness of the conveyor belts' idlers which results in the higher {{temperature of}} <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies,</b> which in turn is the main factor influencing their level of durability. This article includes research methodology of idlers, which was designed to determine the direct impact of lower tightness of <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies,</b> at a determined load, on the temperature of <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Research results are presented in the form of dependence of ΔT temperature increase, in t time function, and at the determined F radial load. The characteristics set during the tests included the temperature of <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies</b> and were analysed in terms of the possible or potential risk of bearing assembly seizure. The research carried out showed the significant impact of load on the temperature increase of <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Constant recording of temperature increases and the nature of changes allowed conclusions to be drawn concerning the seizure of bearings or idler's seals. A thermographic (infrared) camera enabled pivotal areas located in the bearing assembly to be determined, which may indicate the seizure, and helped to present thermography images showing the distribution of the temperature in the idler which occurred during testing...|$|E

40|$|A failed {{suspension}} device fitted with the antenna {{of a helicopter}} was forwarded to this laboratory for investigation. Following this, another {{suspension device}} fitted on to the same aircraft which broke post installation onboard, was also forwarded for failure analysis. Examination revealed that both the devices broke {{in a similar fashion}} wherein rotary <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly</b> got separated from the base plate and along the weld joint. Study of the fractured regions did not show any evidences of progressive failure such as fatigue and/or stress corrosion cracking. Instead, gross deformation in the base plate preceded the separation of the rotary <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly.</b> All the fastener holes on the base plate were also found deformed and elongated. These indicate that the failure of the suspension device was due to sudden inadvertent load on the component while in operation. Considering the mode of failure and the identical nature of failure in both the cases, it appears most probable that the failure was due to some problems related to functioning of the antenna deployment/retraction system installed in this particular aircraft...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{computationally}} efficient {{finite element}} analysis model of the rotary forging process for assembling a wheel hub <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly</b> is presented. The analysis model is composed of a part of material defined by two artificial planes of symmetry, which is to reduce computational time taken in simulating the holistic process. Three cases of 30 °, 60 ° and 90 ° analysis models for simulating rotary forging processes are studied to validate the present {{finite element analysis}} model. The predictions at their planes of symmetry and mid-planes are investigated and compared with the experiments, revealing that the predictions at the mid-planes are in good agreement with the experiments for all the cases while those at the planes of symmetry are to the contrary. Thus, the 60 ° analysis model is recommended for both computational efficiency and solution reliability.
