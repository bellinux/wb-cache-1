5|$|Unlike other insects, fleas do {{not possess}} {{compound}} eyes but instead only have simple eyespots with a single <b>biconvex</b> lens; some species lack eyes altogether. Their bodies are laterally compressed, permitting easy movement through the hairs or feathers on the host's body (or {{in the case of}} humans, under clothing). The flea body is covered with hard plates called sclerites. These sclerites are covered with many hairs and short spines directed backward, which also assist its movements on the host. The tough body is able to withstand great pressure, likely an adaptation to survive attempts to eliminate them by scratching.|$|E

25|$|Cross section—the {{horizontal}} cross-section {{taken at}} {{some distance from}} the base. It is possible to discern retouching or rebuilding in deteriorated parts of the edges. The following types of cross section are commonly seen: triangular (sub-triangular and backed triangular), rhombic (rhomboidal and backed rhomboidal), trapezium (trapezoid and backed trapezoidal), pentagon (pentagonal and backed pentagonal), polygonal, <b>biconvex</b> or lenticular (sub lenticular).|$|E
25|$|If {{the lens}} is <b>biconvex</b> or plano-convex, a {{collimated}} {{beam of light}} passing through the lens converges to a spot (a focus) behind the lens. In this case, the lens is called a positive or converging lens. The distance from the lens to the spot is the focal length of the lens, which is commonly abbreviated f in diagrams and equations.|$|E
25|$|Giambattista della Porta added a “lenticular crystal” or <b>biconvex</b> lens to {{the camera}} obscura {{description}} in the 1589 second edition of Magia Naturalis. He also imagined use of the camera obscura to project hunting scenes, battles, games or anything desired. Real or artificial forests, rivers, mountains as well as animals {{could be used for}} scenes on an outside stage and projected into a dark room with spectators.|$|E
25|$|All {{formulas}} {{require an}} {{estimation of the}} position that the IOL will sit in the eye, a factor known as the ELP, which is defined as the distance between the cornea and the IOL. ELP correlates with the placement of the IOL inside the eye, whether it is in the anterior chamber in the sulcus or in the capsular bag. It also varies with the implant’s configuration and the location of its optical center. For example, the use of a meniscus lens calls for a smaller ELP value than a <b>biconvex</b> IOL.|$|E
25|$|Working {{with a soft}} hammer {{allows a}} knapper greater control of the knapping and reduces waste of the raw material, {{allowing}} the production of longer, sharper, more uniform edges that will increase the tool's working life. Hand axes made with a soft hammer are usually more symmetrical and smooth, with rectilinear edges and shallow indentations that are broad and smooth {{so that it is}} difficult to distinguish where one flake starts and another ends. They generally have a regular <b>biconvex</b> cross-section and the intersection of the two faces forms an edge with an acute angle, usually of around 30°. They were worked with great skill and therefore they are more aesthetically attractive. They are usually associated with periods of highly developed tool making such as the Micoquien or the Mousterian. Soft hammer manufacturing is not reliable as the sole dating method.|$|E
500|$|Derived {{from the}} Greek word peridion, meaning [...] "small leather pouch", the peridiole is the [...] "egg" [...] of the bird's nest. It is {{a mass of}} basidiospores and glebal tissue {{enclosed}} by a hard and waxy outer shell. The shape may be described as lenticular—like a <b>biconvex</b> lens—and depending on the species, may range in color from whitish to grayish to black. The interior chamber of the peridiole contains a hymenium that is made of basidia, sterile (non-reproductive) structures, and spores. In young, freshly opened fruit bodies, the peridioles lie in a clear gelatinous substance which soon dries.|$|E
500|$|The {{pterosaur}} wrist {{consists of}} two inner (proximal) and four outer (distal) carpals (wrist bones), excluding the pteroid bone, which may itself be a modified distal carpal. The proximal carpals are fused together into a [...] "syncarpal" [...] in mature specimens, while three of the distal carpals fuse to form a distal syncarpal. The remaining distal carpal, referred to here as the medial carpal, but which has also been termed the distal lateral, or pre-axial carpal, articulates on a vertically elongate <b>biconvex</b> facet on the anterior surface of the distal syncarpal. The medial carpal bears a deep concave fovea that opens anteriorly, ventrally and somewhat medially, within which the pteroid articulates. In derived pterodactyloids like pteranodontians and azhdarchoids, metacarpals I-III are small and do not connect to the carpus, instead hanging {{in contact with the}} fourth metacarpal; in nyctosaurids the forelimb digits besides the wingfinger have been lost altogether.|$|E
500|$|The spores of C.micaceus are reddish-brown, with {{dimensions}} of 7–10 by 4.5–6µm. Generally, they are [...] (shaped like a <b>biconvex</b> lens), but {{viewed from the}} side they appear more almond-shaped or spindle-shaped, while in front view they appear oval or mitriform (roughly {{the shape of a}} miter—a peaked cap). Spores have a germ pore, a flattened area {{in the center of the}} spore surface through which a germ tube may emerge. The spore-bearing cells (the basidia) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 10–15 by 4–7µm. Studies have shown that the basidia develop in four discrete generations. The first generation basidia are the most protuberant, and extend out the greatest distance from the surface of the hymenium. Subsequent generations of basidia have shorter and less protuberant bodies. When a living gill is viewed with a microscope, the four sets of basidia can be seen distinctly. Arthur Buller coined the term [...] to describe this mode of hymenial development. The purpose of the staggered basidia sizes is to facilitate the release of spores from the hymenium. There are four zones of spore discharge that correspond to the four sets of basidia, and basidia that have released all of their spores quickly begin to autodigest. The staggered setup minimizes the chance of spores colliding with neighboring basidia during release.|$|E

2500|$|The XF11C-3 {{was first}} {{delivered}} to the USN in May 1933, with a Wright R-1820-80 radial engine rated at [...] Trials revealed a [...] increase in speed over the F11C-2, but the extra weight caused a decrease in maneuverability. The Navy felt the handling degradation was more than offset by the increase in speed, however. During testing the XF11C-3 had its wood-framed wing replaced by the metal-structured, <b>biconvex,</b> NACA 2212 airfoil wing, and soon after was redesignated XBF2C-1 (Model 67A) {{in keeping with the}} new Bomber-Fighter category.|$|E
2500|$|After the 1995 {{finding of}} a Luwian <b>biconvex</b> seal at Troy VII, {{there has been}} a heated {{discussion}} over the language that was spoken in Homeric Troy. Frank Starke of the University of Tübingen recently demonstrated that the name of Priam, king of Troy {{at the time of the}} Trojan War, is connected to the Luwian compound Priimuua, which means [...] "exceptionally courageous". [...] "The certainty is growing that Wilusa/Troy belonged to the greater Luwian-speaking community," [...] although it is not entirely clear whether Luwian was primarily the official language or in daily colloquial use.|$|E
2500|$|Platelets, {{also called}} thrombocytes ( [...] + , [...] "blood clot cell"), are a {{component}} of blood whose function (along with the coagulation factors) is to stop bleeding by clumping and clotting blood vessel injuries. Platelets have no cell nucleus: they are fragments of cytoplasm that are derived from the megakaryocytes of the bone marrow, and then enter the circulation. These unactivated platelets are <b>biconvex</b> discoid (lens-shaped) structures, [...] 2–3µm in greatest diameter. Platelets are found only in mammals, whereas in other animals (e.g. birds, amphibians) thrombocytes circulate as intact mononuclear cells.|$|E
2500|$|Lenses are {{classified}} by the {{curvature of the}} two optical surfaces. A lens is <b>biconvex</b> (or double convex, or just convex) if both surfaces are [...] If both surfaces have the same radius of curvature, the lens is equiconvex. A lens with two [...] surfaces is biconcave (or just concave). If one of the surfaces is flat, the lens is plano-convex or plano-concave depending on the curvature of the other surface. A lens with one convex and one concave side is convex-concave or meniscus. It is this type of lens that is most commonly used in corrective lenses.|$|E
2500|$|A {{huge number}} of {{advanced}} features were incorporated into the resulting M.52 design, many of which hint at a detailed knowledge of supersonic aerodynamics. In particular, the design featured a conical nose and sharp wing leading edges, as it was known that round-nosed projectiles could not be stabilised at supersonic speeds. [...] The design used very thin wings of <b>biconvex</b> section proposed by Jakob Ackeret for low drag. The wing tips were [...] "clipped" [...] to keep them clear of the conical shock wave generated by {{the nose of the}} aircraft. The fuselage had the minimum cross-section allowable around the centrifugal engine with fuel tanks in a saddle over the top.|$|E
2500|$|Rays {{of light}} travel in {{straight}} lines and change {{when they are}} reflected and partly absorbed by an object, retaining information about the color and brightness of the surface of that object. Lit objects reflect rays of light in all directions. A small enough opening in a screen only lets through rays that travel directly from different points in the scene {{on the other side}} and together form an image of that scene when they are reflected on a surface into the eye of an observer. The human eye as well as those of other animals including birds, fish reptiles [...] etc. works much like a camera obscura with an opening (pupil), a <b>biconvex</b> lens and a surface where the image is formed (retina).|$|E
2500|$|The M.52 {{had very}} thin wings of <b>biconvex</b> section, {{which had been}} first {{proposed}} by Jakob Ackeret, as they gave {{a low level of}} drag. These wings were so thin that they were known to test pilots as 'Gillette' wings, named after the brand of razor. The wing tips were [...] "clipped" [...] to keep them clear of the conical shock wave that was generated by the nose of the aircraft. Both wide-chord ailerons and split-flaps were fitted to the wings. As a high speed wing of this shape and size had not been tested before, Miles produced a full-scale wooden model of the wing for aerodynamic testing purposes; other representative portions of the aircraft, such as the tailplane, would be similarly produced and underwent low-speed flight testing.|$|E
2500|$|The M.52's design {{underwent}} {{many changes}} during development {{due to the}} uncertain nature of the task. The overseeing committee was concerned that the <b>biconvex</b> wing would not give sufficient altitude for testing the aircraft in a dive. The thin wing {{could have been made}} thicker if required, or a section added to increase the wing span. As the project progressed, an increase in total weight led to concerns that power would be insufficient; thus, the adoption of rocket assistance or extra fuel tanks were considered. Another proposed measure was that the M.52 be adapted to become a parasite aircraft, launching at high altitude from beneath a large bomber serving as a mother ship. The calculated landing speed of [...] (comparable with modern fighters but high for that time) combined with its relatively small undercarriage track was another concern; however, this arrangement was accepted.|$|E
2500|$|Diplodocoidea {{is defined}} as all neosauropods {{more closely related to}} Diplodocus longus than Saltasaurus loricatus. [...] The group is named after Diplodocus, its best known member. [...] Other {{prominent}} dinosaurs contained in this clade include Apatosaurus, Supersaurus, and Amphicoelias. [...] Diplodocoids are distinguished by a unique head shape, which displays certain highly derived features when compared to other sauropods. [...] The teeth are located entirely anterior to the antorbital fenestra and the snout is especially broad. [...] In some rebbachisaurids, this is taken to such an extreme that the teeth are packed into a row along the transverse portion of the jaw. [...] Several unique features are also noted in the tails of certain diplodocoids. [...] Among the diplodocids, there was a marked {{increase in the number of}} caudal vertebrae. [...] Most sauropods have between forty and fifty caudal vertebrae, but in diplodocids this number jumps to eighty or more. [...] In addition, the most distal vertebrae develop a <b>biconvex</b> shape and together form a long, bony rod at the end of the tail, often referred to as a “whiplash tail.” [...] Increased caudal count and a whiplash tail may be features shared by all members of the Diplodocoid group, but, due to a scarcity of evidence, this has yet to be proven.|$|E
2500|$|At a more {{detailed}} level, there were many {{differences between the two}} aircraft. The Karakán's wing had a greater span and area. Lippisch had a used standard Göttingen airfoil whereas Rotter used one of his own, though both designers chose to merge into more symmetric profiles outboard. The Karakán was the heavier of the two, with the higher wing loading. The major differences were in the forward part of the semi-monocoque, ply-covered fuselages; the Karakán replaced the open Wien cockpit with one enclosed under a removable, wood framed [...] canopy, with four transparent panels on each side, which maintained the smoothly increasing fuselage section. The rearmost canopy transparencies, {{on either side of the}} pilot's seat, had large oval holes in them but the Karakán was one of the first gliders with enclosed seating. Drag from the wing/fuselage junction troubled designers of the day and Lippisch mounted the wings of the Wien from a parallel sided pylon rising rather abruptly from the fuselage; Rotter extended the upper fuselage frames smoothly inwards then outwards into a stub wing, with a span about the same as the maximum [...] fuselage width, to ease the transition from fuselage to wing. [...] The fuselages of both designs became slender rearwards, the Wien's more than the Karakán; sections through the latter's fuselage were more <b>biconvex</b> or almond shaped than the Wien's oval, making it [...] narrower. The Wien and the Karakán had very similar vetical tails, with balanced rudders, large and rounded apart from a straight underside to avoid the ground, mounted on small, short fins. [...] Both had all-moving tailplanes mounted close to mid-fuselage, though of different plans. Like most sailplanes of the time, both landed on a single skid, the Karakán's rather longer, with a small metal tailskid to protect the rear fuselage.|$|E
