25|$|The Tavor {{attachment}} of {{the piston}} to a heavy <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier,</b> and {{the extension of}} the mainspring into the hollow stem of the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier,</b> bears a family resemblance to the internal mechanism of the AK-47.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the bolt}} is locked into the barrel {{extension}} by locking lugs, so the expanding gas forces the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> backward a short distance. As the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> {{moves toward the}} butt of the gun, the bolt cam pin, riding in a slot on the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier,</b> forces the bolt to rotate and thus unlocks it from the barrel extension. Once the bolt is fully unlocked it begins its rearward movement along with the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier.</b> The bolt's rearward motion extracts the empty cartridge case from the chamber. As soon as the neck of the case clears the barrel extension, the bolt's spring-loaded ejector forces it out the ejection port {{in the side of the}} upper receiver.|$|E
25|$|The MAR has {{undergone}} several changes over time, {{and it is}} worth noting that it may also be found with a polymer-coated aluminum stock or an all-polymer stock. The Model 699 is available with a 267mm barrel and optional left-side charging handle which is welded onto the left side of the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> and protrudes through a slot cut in the receiver cover that is covered by a spring-loaded cover while the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> is forward.|$|E

5000|$|The MP5SFA2 (SF - single-fire) was {{developed}} in 1986 {{in response to the}} American FBI solicitation for a [...] "9 mm Single-fire Carbine". It {{is the same as the}} MP5A2 but is fitted with an ambidextrous semi-automatic only trigger group. The MP5SFA3 is similar except it has a retractable metal stock like the MP5A3. Versions delivered after December 1991 are assembled with select-fire <b>bolt</b> <b>carriers</b> allowing fully automatic operation when used with the appropriate trigger module.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{some debate}} {{as to the}} {{relative}} manufacturing quality of each nation's SKS production. The Chinese SKSs varied significantly even among new rifles with some having screwed in barrels, milled trigger groups and <b>bolt</b> <b>carriers</b> with lightening reliefs cut into them being at the top end and cheaper rifles having pinned barrels, stamped trigger groups and slab-sided <b>bolt</b> <b>carriers</b> - though overall quality and serviceability remained high. The main reason for the manufacturing variance comes from differences between rifles made for the Chinese army and those made for export. Yugoslav types are {{generally considered to be}} better made than Chinese export rifles when new, but this is often negated by the poor condition they are in due to hard use and neglect [...] The Chinese types typically have chrome-lined barrels while the Yugoslav versions do not, resulting in some Yugoslavian carbines having bores in considerably worse condition than even the cheapest Chinese SKSs. The Yugo M59/66 rifles also are unique in having a gas shut off valve for grenade launching, which is a common source of malfunctions. While often encountered in well-used condition, Romanian carbines were as well-built as the Soviet versions. In general, carbines made in the USSR are considered the highest quality.|$|R
25|$|The weapon can be {{stripped}} and re-assembled without tools through {{a system of}} cross-pins {{similar to that used}} on earlier HK designs. For cleaning purposes, the G36 dismantles into the following groups: receiver housing, return mechanism, <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> group and trigger group.|$|E
25|$|The Tavor uses a bullpup configuration, {{in which}} the receiver, <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> group and {{magazine}} are placed behind the pistol grip. This shortens the firearm's overall length without sacrificing barrel length. As a result, the Tavor provides carbine overall length, yet can achieve rifle muzzle velocities if equipped with a rifle-length barrel.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} vast {{assortment}} of aftermarket parts and accessories available for AR-15 type rifles. Including: Upper & Lower Receivers, Barrels, Magazines, <b>Bolt</b> <b>Carrier</b> Groups, Charging Handles, Furniture & Stock Kits, Picatinny Rails, Muzzle Devices, Trigger Groups, Bi-Pods, Lasers, Tactical Lights, Carry Handles, Sights, Scopes and Optics, to name a few.|$|E
50|$|The AUG A1, an {{improved}} {{variant of the}} AUG consists of six main assemblies: the barrel, receiver with integrated telescopic sight, <b>bolt</b> and <b>carrier,</b> trigger mechanism, stock and magazine.|$|R
50|$|Semi Auto Open is the Formula 1 {{division}} for self-loading rifles. Optical sights {{are allowed}} together with bipods and muzzle brakes. Bipods {{can be taken}} on and off during a stage, and on some stages it can even be advantageous to switch between different bipod sizes. Many top competitors use rifles with 46 cm (18") barrels in order to run the longer rifle length gas system and achieve a softer recoil impulse. An adjustable gas system is popular. Some also use low mass <b>bolt</b> <b>carriers</b> and buffer weights, which may however cause reliability issues if not tuned correctly.|$|R
50|$|Smith {{became a}} Certified Journeyman in Ordnance and Metallurgy at age 22 in California in the San Francisco Bay Area working at his father's {{facility}} in 1972, trained by immigrant German, Austrian, Hungarian, French and Czechoslovakian craftsmen and ordnance manufacturers. In 1979 he became co-owner {{with his father}} and the company relocated to Mesa, Az and became Western Ordnance International (dba Smith Enterprise). The company produced over 500,000 M16 <b>bolt</b> <b>carriers</b> 60,000 M16 <b>bolts,</b> M14 receivers and building M14 and M16 rifles as well as M1911 handgunss, ANS/PVS5 night vision goggles for Lorton, ITT, and Varo of Garland, Texas.|$|R
25|$|A bolt hold-open device {{locks the}} <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> {{assembly}} open after expending the last cartridge from {{the magazine and}} is released by lifting the bolt catch lever located {{on the left side}} of the receiver. Alternatively, a left-handed shooter may release the bolt by pulling the rubber-coated charging handle to rear a short distance.|$|E
25|$|The Bizon has no {{gas system}} and the {{internal}} components have been modified accordingly. The <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> with integral charging handle was recycled from the AK, but the piston rod and rotary bolt were removed and the piston extension was plugged with a steel insert. The return spring and guide rod are identical {{to those of the}} AK.|$|E
25|$|The G36 uses a short-stroke piston {{system from}} which HK later {{developed}} the HK-416's impingement system. Unlike direct impingement, this system takes gas trailing the bullet {{to operate a}} piston instead of pushing directly on the bolt. The G36's bolt is operated by a cam that guides the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> by its respective cutout. Then when fully pushed forward 7 radial locking lugs fully enclose the chamber.|$|E
50|$|The AKM’s receiver, {{compared}} to the AK-47, is stamped from a smooth 1.0 mm sheet of steel. To the U-shaped stamped sheet metal receiver housing a rear stock trunnion and forward barrel trunnion are fastened using rivets. The receiver housing also features a rigid tubular cross-section support that adds structural strength. Guide rails that assist the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier’s</b> movement which also incorporates the ejector are installed inside the receiver through spot welding. As a weight-saving measure, the stamped receiver cover is of thinner gauge metal {{than that of the}} AK-47. In order to maintain strength and durability it employs both longitudinal and latitudinal reinforcing ribs.|$|R
5000|$|The AKM has a {{modified}} trigger assembly, {{equipped with a}} hammer-release delaying device (installed on the same axis pin together with the trigger and disconnector) commonly called a [...] "rate reducer". In fact its primary purpose is not to reduce the rate of automatic fire; it is a safety device to ensure the weapon will only fire on automatic when the bolt is fully locked, as the hammer is tripped by the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier's</b> last few millimetres of forward movement. The device also reduces [...] "trigger slap" [...] or [...] "trigger bounce" [...] and the weapon’s rate of fire, which also reduces the dispersion of bullets when firing in fully automatic mode. The hammer was also changed and equipped with a protrusion that engages the rate reducer and the trigger has only one notched hammer release arm (compared to two parallel arms in the AK-47).|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} gas-operated firearms, direct impingement does {{away with}} a separate gas cylinder, piston, and operating rod assembly. High-pressure gas acts directly upon the <b>bolt</b> and <b>carrier</b> thereby saving weight, lowering costs, and reducing {{the mass of the}} operating parts, and thereby the wear on mechanical parts due to movement. By removing the gas piston, the potential amount of moving mass is lowered, thus decreasing the potential for a disrupted sight picture, as caused by the mass of the piston adding to the disruptive mass.|$|R
25|$|The G36 is a selective-fire 5.56 mm assault rifle, firing from {{a closed}} rotary bolt. The G36 has a {{conventional}} layout and a modular component design. Common to all variants of the G36 family are: {{the receiver and}} buttstock assembly, <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> group with bolt and the return mechanism and guide rod. The receiver contains the barrel, carry handle with integrated sights, trigger group with pistol grip, handguard and magazine socket.|$|E
25|$|The {{weapon is}} secured against {{misfires}} through a manually operated safety (whose lever, {{as in the}} AKM {{is located on the}} right side of the receiver), that disables the trigger bar and limits the movement of the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier.</b> Sliding the safety selector to the top position (marked with a “Z” symbol) secures the weapon, lowering the lever down (“O” setting) disables the safety. The Tantal feeds from a double-column curved box magazine, made from a synthetic bakelite material or stamped metal, with a 30-round cartridge capacity.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1987 {{the rifle}} was {{extensively}} overhauled and improved (among the changes made, a series of components were introduced that {{were meant to be}} interchangeable with the AK-74, including the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier,</b> bolt, magazines and the burst fire mode was further refined). In January 1988, these product improved prototypes were again evaluated, and in 1989 the rifle was declared to have met its requirements, followed by an order for a pre-production batch, which was manufactured that same year. In 1990 the rifles were successfully evaluated and then transferred for final operational testing. In 1991 the rifle was introduced into service with the Polish Army as the 5,45mm karabinek wz. 1988 (kbk wz. 88).|$|E
50|$|The Lusa marries some {{concepts}} {{from the}} HK MP5 and Uzi submachine gun without being too similar to either. The complete trigger housing is {{nearly identical to}} that of the MP5, however the other internals are greatly simplified. The <b>bolt</b> and <b>carrier</b> are one welded unit, and the action is a simple blowback, unlike the roller-delay system of the MP5. The Lusa fires from the closed bolt position in both semi- and fully automatic modes. However, the Lusa's barrel can be quickly changed without tools, like the Uzi. The Lusa uses a non reciprocating ambidextrous charging handle with no provision to lock the bolt to the rear, nor does the bolt lock to the rear upon an empty magazine. The rear sight is a simple diopter with screw adjustment. The body is formed from a sheet of stamped and welded steel.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]300 AAC Blackout {{cartridge}} {{was created}} by Advanced Armament Corporation in cooperation with Remington Defense, {{under the direction of}} AAC's President Kevin Brittingham. The round is very similar to the [...]300 Whisper cartridge created years earlier by SSK Industries, but AAC submitted the cartridge for SAAMI standardization and allows any manufacturer to use the specifications. This has led to far wider adoption than the [...]300 Whisper, which is proprietary to SSK. This round has the same overall length and width as the popular 5.56×45mm NATO round, except it fires a 30 caliber bullet allowing for much better barrier penetration and terminal ballistics. These dimensions allow the 300 AAC Blackout to be used in existing magazines designed for M16 or AR-15 rifles. Because the rim of the cartridge is identical, the same <b>bolt</b> and <b>carrier</b> can be used between calibers. The only part that needs to be changed to convert an existing AR-15 chambered in 5.56×45mm to one chambered in 300 BLK is the barrel.|$|R
2500|$|The T44 {{participated in}} a {{competitive}} service rifle competition conducted by the Infantry Board at Fort Benning, Georgia against the Springfield T47 (a modified T25) and the T48, a variant of Fabrique Nationale's FN FAL (from [...] "Fusil Automatique Leger", French for [...] "light automatic rifle"). [...] The T47, which {{did not have a}} bolt roller and performed worse in dust and cold weather tests than both the T44 and the T48, was dropped from consideration in 1953. [...] During 1952–53, testing proved the T48 and the T44 roughly comparable in performance, with the T48 holding an advantage in ease of field stripping and dust resistance, as well as a longer product development lead time. [...] A Newsweek article in July 1953 hinted that the T48/FAL might be selected over the T44. [...] During the winter of 1953–54, both rifles competed in the winter rifle trials at U.S. Army facilities in the Arctic. [...] Springfield Armory engineers, anxious to ensure the selection of the T44, had been specially preparing and modifying the test T44 rifles for weeks with the aid of the armory's cold chamber, including redesign of the T44 gas regulator and custom modifications to magazines and other parts to reduce friction and seizing in extreme cold. [...] The T48 rifles received no such special preparation, and in the continued cold weather testing began to experience sluggish gas system functioning, aggravated by the T48's close-fitting surfaces between <b>bolt</b> and <b>carrier,</b> and carrier and receiver. [...] FN engineers opened the gas ports in an attempt to improve functioning, but this caused early/violent extraction and broken parts {{as a result of the}} increased pressures. [...] As a result, the T44 was ranked superior in cold weather operation to the T48. [...] The Arctic Test Board report made it clear that the T48 needed improvement and that the U.S. would not adopt the T48 until it had successfully completed another round of Arctic tests the following winter.|$|R
25|$|The SG 550 has a side-folding {{skeletonized}} buttstock (folds to {{the right}} side of the receiver) and a lightweight aluminium bipod that folds into grooves in the lower handguard. The hinged stock is firmly locked in the folded position by a socket in the butt which clips into a plastic stud on the handguard; a firm pull will release the stock which is then swung into the closed position and locked by a button catch. A collapsible side-folding stock is also available. The stock, pistol grip, and handguards are made of a high-strength polymer, and are produced in either green or black colour options. The steel receiver housing and several other components are manufactured using stamping and welding; external steel surfaces are finished with a ceramic-reinforced enamel coat known as Ilaflon. The gas system's components are made of stainless steel. The barrel, bolt, <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier,</b> and firing pin are all made with steel that has been gas nitrided, hardened and tempered. The bolt and carrier, along with most other components internal to the receiver undergo a phosphating process.|$|E
25|$|The SG 550 is a selective-fire 5.56×45mm NATO {{assault rifle}} firing from a closed bolt. It has a gas-actuated piston-driven {{long-stroke}} operating system {{derived from the}} SIG SG 540 series of rifles, which uses burnt powder gases vented through a port in the barrel to power the weapon's moving parts. Once inside the gas cylinder, propellant gases pass through an L-shaped channel machined in the piston head and are directed forward towards the gas valve. The pressure build-up {{in front of the}} piston head pushes the piston and <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> rearward. As the piston is driven back, the gas port and the L-shaped channel move out of alignment, cutting off the supply of gas to the cylinder. Surplus gas and powder residues are evacuated through an exhaust port in the gas cylinder. This system ensures that only the precise volume of gas required to overcome the mass and resistance of the rifle's moving assembly is admitted from the barrel. The manually adjustable gas valve has two settings, one for normal operation, and the second setting for use in the presence of heavy fouling or icing.|$|E
25|$|The Desert Eagle uses a gas-operated {{mechanism}} normally {{found in}} rifles, {{as opposed to}} the short recoil or blow-back designs most commonly seen in semi-automatic pistols. When a round is fired, gases are ported out through a small hole in the barrel near the breech. These travel forward through a small tube under the barrel, to a cylinder near the front of the barrel. The slide which acts as the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> has a small piston on the front that fits into this cylinder. When the gases reach the cylinder they push the piston rearward. The slide rides rearward on two rails {{on either side of the}} barrel, both with action springs around them, with a large pin inside the camming surface in the rear of the bolt that causes the bolt to rotate and unlock. A cylindrical mechanism on the left side of the bolt, called the bolt stabilizer assembly, prevents the bolt from rotating freely as the slide moves, enabling it to align correctly with the barrel again as the slide moves it forward. The spring loaded ejector pin is continually being depressed by the case, until the case is free of the chamber and releases tension from the ejector, causing the case to fly out, becoming released from the extractor claw in the process. The slide reaches its rear-most travel, then rides forward again under tension of the springs around the slide rails, the bottom lug of the bolt pushes a new round into the chamber, then the bolt locks up and the gun can be fired again once the trigger is released.|$|E
500|$|It fires {{from an open}} bolt and is gas operated. When {{the trigger}} is pulled, the bolt and <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> move forward under {{the power of the}} recoil spring. A {{cartridge}} is stripped from the belt, chambered, and discharged, sending a bullet down the bore. Expanding propellant gases are diverted {{through a hole in the}} barrel into a chamber. This pressure moves a piston providing the energy to extract and eject the spent casing as well as advance the belt and compress the recoil spring, thus preparing for subsequent shots. At [...] long and [...] in weight ( [...] including a 200-round belt and plastic ammo box), the M249 is a cumbersome weapon.|$|E
2500|$|When fired, {{a portion}} of the {{propellant}} gases are evacuated into the gas cylinder through a [...] port, drilled at a 30° angle in the barrel, and a channel in the gas block. The high-pressure gases drive the piston rod (which is attached to the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier)</b> rearward. During this rearward movement, a cam slot machined into the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> engages a cam pin on the bolt and rotates the bolt, unlocking the action. The arrangement of parts on the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> assembly provides for a degree of free travel, allowing gas pressure in the barrel to drop to a safe level before unlocking. To the immediate rear of the chrome-plated piston head is a notched ring which provides a reduced bearing surface and alleviates excess gas build-up. As the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> travels back, it compresses the return spring guided in a hollowed section of the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> and the return energy contained in the spring drives the moving assembly back forward, stripping a new round from the magazine and locking the action. The cocking handle is attached to the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> {{on the right side of}} the receiver and reciprocates with each shot; the handle is bent upwards allowing for operation with the left hand while the shooting hand remains on the pistol grip.|$|E
2500|$|Gas is tapped {{from the}} barrel as the bullet moves past a gas port located above the rifle's front sight base. The gas expands into the port {{and down a}} gas tube, located above the barrel that runs from the front sight base into the AR-15's upper receiver. Here, the gas tube {{protrudes}} into a [...] "gas key" [...] (<b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> key), which accepts the gas and funnels it into the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Behind the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> is {{a plastic}} or metal buffer, which rests {{in line with}} a return spring. The buffer spring begins to push the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> and bolt back toward the chamber once it is {{compressed}} sufficiently. A groove machined into the upper receiver guides the bolt cam pin and prevents it and the bolt from rotating into a closed position. The bolt's locking lugs push a fresh round from the magazine as the bolt moves forward. The round is guided by feed ramps into the chamber. As the bolt's locking lugs move past the barrel extension, the cam pin twists into a pocket milled into the upper receiver. This twisting action follows the groove cut into the carrier and forces the bolt to twist and [...] "lock" [...] into the barrel extension.|$|E
2500|$|... {{describes}} the cycling mechanism {{used in the}} original AR-15. The <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> acts as a movable cylinder and the bolt itself acts as a stationary piston. This mechanism is often called [...] "direct gas impingement" [...] (DGI), although it differs from prior gas systems. Designer Eugene Stoner did not consider the AR-15 to be a conventional direct impingement mechanism, but that is how {{it came to be}} characterized.|$|E
2500|$|The upper {{receiver}} {{incorporates the}} fore stock, the charging handle, the forward assist, the gas operating system, the barrel, the bolt and <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> assembly. AR-15s employ a modular design. Thus one upper receiver can {{quickly and easily}} be substituted for another. Upper receivers are available with barrels of different weights, lengths, calibers, and rail systems with various sights and accessories. The standard AR-15 rifle uses a 20" [...] barrel. Although, both shorter 16" [...] carbine barrels and longer 24" [...] target barrels are also available.|$|E
2500|$|The compact SG 552 Commando (full {{designation}} as the 552-2P) carbine {{was released}} in July 1998. It has a shorter [...] barrel (with an open, 3-prong flash suppressor) and gas tube, ventilated handguards and a redesigned <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> group that was integrated with the piston rod to form a single moving assembly. The SG 552 series rifles have a [...] long sight radius. The return mechanism has been moved {{to the rear of}} the receiver housing and its recoil spring is guided in a way analogous to that of the AK-47: on a steel guide rod (later models feature a polymer guide rod) resting against the lower receiver's rear surface under tension of the compressed recoil spring. Like the SG 550/551, this model can accept rails and accessories enabling the use of optics. A long barrel version of the SG 552 known as the SG 552 LB incorporates a [...] barrel with provision to fire rifle grenades and support a bayonet. The SG 552 models were discontinued in 2008 and replaced by the SG 553. Upgrade part kits are available to convert a SG 552 in to a SG 553.|$|E
5000|$|Has [...] "in the white" [...] <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier,</b> {{while the}} AKM <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> is blued.|$|E
50|$|The breech {{is locked}} by a {{rotating}} bolt, with two locking lugs engaging locking recesses in the receiver. The gas piston is hinged to the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> assembly, and its vertical travel {{makes it possible}} to bend the group making machine gun assembly and disassembly for maintenance easier. The protruding rear part of the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> assembly features spiral shaped cuts, which provide a controlled rotation of the bolt. The mainspring is accommodated in the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> assembly slide channel. A cartridge extractor with a latch is mounted in the rear part of the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> assembly. The cocking lever, mounted on the right, is not integral with the <b>bolt</b> <b>carrier</b> and does not reciprocate as the gun fires.The machine gun fires from the rear sear.|$|E
