One of the best known examples of the tools AITIC has developed to assist the LAC representatives is its Glossary of Most Commonly Used International Trade Terms with Particular Reference to the WTO, which is in its second edition and has been translated into the three official languages of the WTO (English, French and Spanish) and also into Portuguese, Russian and Macedonian. The agency’s flexible structure allows it to provide tailor-made services to address the particular needs of the LACs for information and analysis {{on a wide range of}} issues concerning trade and development in the context of the WTO. Examples of such services are: organisation of workshops and “Flash Meetings”, on topics of interest to the LACs (i.e., Safeguards, Services, WTO Rules), publishing information notes (e.g., Aid for Trade, the Enhanced Integrated Framework for LDCs). In addition, its Official Fellowship Programme provides on-the-job training for LAC officials. AITIC’s recent capacity building programmes have included courses for Geneva-based delegates on Services and Agriculture. Most of the AITIC activities (and website) are provided in the three official languages of the WTO. Finally, LACs have unrestricted access to the facilities of the Non-Residents' Unit. AITIC was an initiative of Switzerland's federal authorities to assist resource constrained developing countries and economies in transition to have a more active trade diplomacy. Originally set up as an association under Swiss private law, AITIC was transformed into an intergovernmental organisation in 2004 and has been funded during its first five-year <b>budgetary</b> <b>cycle</b> by seven Sponsoring Members (Denmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK).

40|$|Do {{parliamentary}} parties politicize compliance {{within the}} European Semester? If so, which conflict lines organize parliamentary debates? In {{order to address}} these questions, this discussion paper analyses national parliamentary participation in two <b>budgetary</b> <b>cycles</b> of the European Semester (2014 and 2015) in Austria, France, Germany, and Ireland. While in France and Germany, compliance within the European Semester has been subject to strong politicization, {{this has not been}} the case in Austria and Ireland. Moreover, strong politicization coincided with the contestation of country-specific recommendations among the parliamentary parties. The empirical analysis established that strong formal powers in budgetary matters constitute an important prerequisite allowing parliamentary parties to articulate their contestation. However, the willingness to comply depends most directly on whether the content of country-specific recommendations is coherent with the economic preferences of a political party, not the government–opposition cleavage. Wird compliance im Rahmen des Europäischen Semesters durch nationale Parteien politisiert? Falls ja, entlang welcher Konfliktlinien orientieren sich parlamentarische Debatten? Um diese Fragen anzugehen, analysiert dieser Artikel die Beteiligung nationaler Parlamente in zwei Budgetzyklen des Europäischen Semesters (2014 und 2015) in Österreich, Deutschland, Frankreich und Irland. Während in Deutschland und Frankreich compliance im Rahmen des Europäischen Semesters verstärkt Gegenstand von Politisierung war, trifft dies in Irland und Österreich nicht zu. Darüber hinaus wurden in den Fällen mit starker Politisierung verstärkt auch Anfechtungen der länderspezifischen Empfehlungen durch die parlamentarischen Parteien festgestellt. Die empirische Analyse zeigt, dass starke formale Befugnisse in Budgetangelegenheiten eine wichtige Voraussetzung für Parlamente darstellen, länderspezifische Empfehlungen anzufechten. Allerdings hängt die Bereitschaft, den länderspezifischen Empfehlungen zu folgen, in großem Ausmaß davon ab, ob diese inhaltlich mit der zugrunde liegenden ökonomischen Haltung der Partei übereinstimmt und nicht von der Kluft zwischen Regierung und Opposition. 1 Introduction 2 What factors account for consent or contestation of EU policy guidance? 3 Research design 4 Empirical findings EU policy guidance in Ireland and Austria: Explaining domestic consent Explaining domestic contestation of EU policy guidance in Germany and France 5 Discussion Reference...|$|R

40|$|This {{report on}} Local Budget Management Performance (KIPAD) in 2010 is a {{continuation}} of research undertaken last year on the same broad issues. The study examines four broad areas of sub-national (regional, local) government budgetary processes: planning when local governments undertake a range of activities to plan {{what needs to be done}} and to prepare draft budgets; discussion when governments discuss and make determinations about provisions of draft budgets; implementation during which governments carry out programs contained in endorsed budgets with funding appropriations contained therein; and, finally, accountability at which point governments have to account for implementation of budget programs and expenditure. This KIPAD research project was the brainchild of a network of NGOs which also developed and implemented it as a means of monitoring and evaluating local government budget performance. With support from The Asia Foundation, the National Secretariat of the Indonesian Forum for Budget Transparency (Seknas FITRA) organized the various research stages in collaboration with 28 like-minded groups in regional areas, including NGOs, other community groups and university research units. The research 2 ̆ 7 s overall aim was to assess the extent to which principles of good governance (transparency, participation, accountability and gender equality) were being integrated into local budgetary processes in areas studied. More specifically, it aimed to provide feedback to local governments to help them to lift their performance in <b>budgetary</b> <b>cycles</b> from start to finish. By looking at this report, local governments will be able to tell to what extent their budgetary processes are in accord with requirements outlined and to benchmark innovative practices put in place by other governments. The central government will hopefully also use the study as a chance to have a fresh look at national policies for improved sub-national budget performance throughout Indonesia. NGOs too should be able to use it as a resource for their advocacy work, particularly on budgetary issues—especially pro-poor advocacy on budgets in areas studied. This report is based on the premise that decentralization can be relied upon to give local governments space to develop innovative policies in regions. Since decentralization was introduced in Indonesia, several innovative policies have been developed in regions aimed at enhancing people‘s welfare. Such innovations do not just benefit areas which introduce them, but also encourage other regions to adopt similar or even more progressive policy approaches. So, at the very least, this report seeks to engender a spirit of competition among local governments to help them become more efficient and effective managers—especially of their budgets...|$|R

This leaves us still with the longer run puzzle of a slower growth in patenting, especially by U. S. residents, relative to R&D expenditures. It is conjectured that this reflects more the changing character of patents and R&D than an indication of diminishing returns to R&D and an exhaustion of technological opportunities. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{participation}} in the <b>budgetary</b> <b>cycle</b> has formed a prominent part of the research literature concerned with the budgetary process. More recently there has emerged a body of literature concerned with exploring the political and symbolic nature of the budgetary process. The paper reports upon the outcomes of an empirical study of the introduction of `budgetary participation' in a division of a European subsidiary of a large North American car manufacturer. We detail the long process of consultation and negotiation within the subsidiary, and between it and the European Headquarters. The study provides a revealing instance of the roles of formal budget participation as a ritual of control and legitimation without the substantive involvement of middle managers and suggested to us the introduction of de-coupling and organizational hypocrisy alongside the introduction of budget participation. The study pays close attention to the contingent effects of the wider political context of the division and the relationships between the division, its organizational context and organizational environment, and how this context played upon the budgetary process in the division. The outcomes that we analyse at `Delta' reflect the de-coupling strategies and organizational hypocrisies commonly found in public sector organizations. In this wider setting the corporation persists with the ritual of `tight' budget negotiation and target setting and apparent underachievement in performance. Yet we conclude that the complex technological and political context to the formation and siting of Delta continued and may continue to support its existence...|$|E
30|$|A {{report by}} USDA Forest Service (2014) {{documents}} the financial scale of wildfire management activities including large fire suppression and associated consequences to the Agency’s budget. Large wildfire suppression activities by US Federal agencies have cost nearly $ 24 billion between 2000 and 2013 (adjusted to 2013 US$). This {{does not include}} {{state and local government}} costs nor does it include federal cost for pre-suppression activities (planning, equipment and labor acquisition), wildfire initial attack, or hazardous fuels management. The USDA Forest Service maintains the largest federal wildfire organization representing approximately 70 percent of all federal expenditures on wildfire management. In 1995 wildfire related expenses represented 17 percent of the US Forest Service’s appropriated funds, by 2014, 51 percent of the appropriated funds were related to wildfire management. This increased demand for wildfire suppression has created a <b>budgetary</b> <b>cycle</b> where ever increasing demands for wildfire suppression funding come at the cost of other public land management programs, some of which are intended to directly reduce future wildfire damage. During this period of time, the Agency’s budget has not increased commensurately with the rise in wildfire management expenditures. Thus other major budget items have experienced significant reduction; for example vegetation and watershed management (22 percent reduction), facilities (67 percent reduction), roads (46 percent reduction), and deferred maintenance (95 percent reduction) (USDA Forest Service 2014). Increasing wildfire damage to human and ecological systems compromise public land management agencies such as the USDA Forest Service’s ability to maintain key ecological function and the provisioning of ecosystem services.|$|E

We also analyse the role of extraordinary operations which reduced the level of public debt in the same time frame while leaving the net worth of the public sector broadly unchanged. Our analysis suggests that temporary measures and extraordinary operations were used mainly to comply formally with EU fiscal rules without incurring the economic and political costs of more structural adjustment. Policy-makers bought time in a worsening cyclical context, expecting the recovery to be imminent. Ex post information reveals that the timing of this strategy was wrong. In a broader temporal perspective, the use of extraordinary operations has made it possible to postpone more permanent actions which would have improved the sustainability of Italian public finances.

He suggested that there are many options for movement in that direction. This article briefly discusses one incremental option within the established political system, intervention within the new Congressional budgetary process. This is not an insignificant strategy. Its purpose is to influence the way the national budget is constructed. The budget incorporates to an important degree the society 2 ̆ 7 s prevailing definition of its priorities. Furthermore, future policy alternatives are vitally affected by budget decisions, as mandated budget authority strongly restricts future social policy alternatives. Therefore, an understanding of the meaning of the new Congressional Budget Act and some of the problems in its implementation is critical to developing an effective strategy for impacting that process. The Act offers a significant opportunity to individual citizens and organized groups to change the direction of national priorities, among them welfare and warfare. It provides a relatively fixed time schedule around which collective action can be organized, and it identifies the individuals and committees necessary to approach. A strategy built around this process is appropriate to the social work profession. Many social welfare professionals are excellently qualified to perform the policy analysis tasks and to construct the crucial political coalitions which support this kind of intervention.

40|$|U suvremenim je uvjetima jedan od nezaobilaznih trendova u lokalnim sustavima decentralizacija, napose fiskalna. U tom se ozračju posebice naglašava financijska autonomija lokalnih jedinica i na rashodnoj i na prihodnoj strani. Rastući je naglasak na izvorima financiranja lokalnih javnih usluga, posebice u kontekstu često nedostatnih sredstava, ali i odgovornosti lokalnih vlasti za pružene javne usluge. Na lokalnim je razinama možda ta odgovornost to veća s obzirom na to da je riječ o “najneposrednijoj” razini vlasti, razini koja bi trebala moći ponajbolje identificirati potrebe građana i odgovoriti na njih. Na tom su tragu, posebice na lokalnim razinama, primjetne novije prakse uključivanja građana u pojedine faze proračunskog ciklusa. U tim se okvirima javlja i pitanje uporabe samooporezivanja, specifičnog instrumenta financiranja javnih dobara. One of {{the most}} {{significant}} trends in local finances of the day is fiscal decentralisation, a process which is very much present in both Croatia and Macedonia. In the context of the aims of decentralisation, and with regard to frequently limited local financial capacities, sources of funding for local public services and infrastructure attract the attention of both theory and practice. Along these lines, this paper takes a look at self-taxation, a specific manner of financing local public goods with a long tradition in both countries, often referred to as an indigenous instrument of collecting funds for local expenditure.

40|$|Barac (2001) {{describes}} {{corporate governance}} as the structures, processes, cultures and systems that stimulate the successful operation of organisations. It {{is the process}} by which the owners and creditors of an organisation exert control and require accountability for the resources entrusted to the organisation. For an organisation to be accountable and transparent, a number of corporate-governance components such as internal audit, an audit committee, internal controls and a records-management programme need to be put in place. A close working relationship between these structures can improve the effectiveness of corporate governance (Rezaee 2010 : 48). However, records management is often excluded from components of corporate governance as it is demonstrated in the results of this study. Records management is a corporate function that has the potential to support corporate governance if its principles are appropriately implemented. Willis (2005 : 86) contends that many organisations are primarily focusing on corporate governance, and as a result, ‘records management is an increasingly important preoccupation’. The link between recorded information and corporate governance is widely acknowledged. The International Records Management Trust (IRMT) (1999 : 64) posits that corporate governance is supported by three functions, namely, auditing, accounting and information management. The King report III on corporate governance in South Africa also acknowledges a link between good governance, compliance with the law and information management (Institute of Directors in Southern Africa [IoDSA] 2009 : 1). For example, in terms of clause 5. 6 of the King report III, recorded information is the most important asset of an organisation as it is the evidence of business activities. According to Australia National Audit Offie (2003), records management is a key component of any organisation’s corporate governance and is critical to its accountability and transparency.

Performance budgeting principles are, however, applied not only on a government wide basis, but also in funding systems applied to specific categories of government services. This paper does not attempt to review the empirical literature on all such "sectoral" performance budgeting systems. Rather, it undertakes a case study of the literature on one specific sectoral system-output-based hospital funding systems.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{issues relating}} to the establishment and financial management of extrabudgetary funds (EBFs), {{a large group of}} government entities that on average accounts for 40 to 45 percent of central government expenditure-two-thirds of which represents social security funds-in countries at various stages of development. If improperly designed and managed, EBFs can undermine effective fiscal control. However, they also bring potential benefits in the form of greater autonomy of decision-making in countries with well-established governance and financial management systems that have applied the "agency model" of devolved public management and fiscal control. The paper develops a typology of EBFs and argues that EBFs are frequently created because of failures in the budget system and political economy factors that need to be recognized and, where possible, corrected. The paper recommends that data on EBFs be consolidated within a unified system of fiscal reporting and proposes an analytical framework that governments might use to evaluate the effectiveness and utility of their EBFs.

40|$|Several {{features}} of Tanzania''s budget system find {{their roots in}} the arrangements inherited from the United Kingdom. These include a legal framework that emphasizes accountability; a cabinet of ministers with strong budget decision-making powers; a parliament with very limited budget powers; and a similar external audit organization. In both countries, budget execution is decentralized to individual ministries, with accounting officers responsible to a parliamentary accounts committee. These similarities are blended with contrasts, including in Tanzania: a presidential system of government, one dominant political party, a written constitution, and some fragmentation in central budget decision-making within the executive.

40|$|Government budgets—both State budgets (APBNs) {{and local}} {{government}} budgets (APBDs) —are important instruments used by government to determine national and regional development priorities. Indeed, {{it could be said}} that government budgets mirror political decisions taken jointly by the executive and legislative wings of government. Such decisions necessarily have a big impact on community living standards: depending {{on the extent to which}} resultant budgetary expenditure brings benefit to people—especially for the poor and women—in the form of better public services. In short, budgets are yardsticks for measuring the extent to which governments govern for the people. The KiPAD research project was the brainchild of a network of NGOs who then developed the idea and implemented it as a means of monitoring and evaluating local government budget performance. With support from The Asia Foundation (TAF), Seknas FITRA has carried out KiPAD studies since 2009. In that year and again in 2010, the study encompassed 42 kabupatens (districts) and cities in Indonesia and involved 28 civil society networks, including NGOs, other community groups and tertiary level research units. The research 2 ̆ 7 s overall aim has been to assess the extent to which principles of good governance (transparency, participation, accountability and gender equality) are being integrated into local budgetary processes. More specifically, it has aimed to provide feedback to local governments to help them lift their budget management performance across all phases of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>cycle.</b> By looking at this report, local governments will be able to tell to what extent their budgetary processes are in accord with requirements outlined in the study and will hopefully be inspired by innovative practices put in place by other governments. We also hope that the central government will treat the study as a chance to have a fresh look at national policies for improved sub-national budget performance throughout Indonesia. NGOs too should be able to use KiPAD as a resource for their advocacy work, particularly on budgetary issues—especially pro-poor budgeting in areas studied. This report—coordinated by Seknas FITRA and supported by TAF and USAID‘s Kinerja Program— incorporates findings of research on budget management in 20 kabupatens and cities for the 2011 fiscal year. It focuses on four stages of the budgetary cycle: 1) planning: which involves various local government activities preparatory to the drafting of annual local budgets; 2) discussion: at this point local governments discuss and reach decisions on budgets they have drafted; 3) implementation: this phase sees local governments carrying out approved budget programs in accordance with allocated funding; and 4) public accountability: at this point governments render an account of implemented budget programs and expenditure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{economic}} debate surrounding both the opportunities {{and the challenges}} arising from European monetary union. It is organised in two parts. Part I examines the economic environment in EMU, analysing the role of markets and the macro-economic framework. It finds that the prospect of EMU has already succeeded in creating a stable macro-economic environment, but that structural reforms aimed at better functioning markets take more time to be implemented and to produce results. Part II investigates the issue of adjustment in EMU in response to macro-economic disturbances, exploring the potential contribution of market mechanisms and macro-economic policies for coping with country-specific shocks. It finds that the new macro-economic framework will soon enable automatic stabilisers to operate better than in the recent past, but that it may take longer for market mechanisms to play their full part. II/ 0452 / 97 -ENEconomic Policy in EMU. Part B. Specific Topics. Â (ECONOMIC PAPERS. No. 125. November 1997. European Commission. Brussels. 187 p. Tabl. Graph. Bibliogr. Free.) This paper explores a number of policy issues deriving from Economic and Monetary Union: - Monetary Policy and the Exchange Rate; - Budgetary Policy; - Shocks and Market Adjustment; - Real and Nominal Convergence. II/ 0453 / 97 -ENOn January 1 st 1999, Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will move to its third and final stage. The exchange rates between the parties will be locked irrevocably and the euro will be introduced. The responsibility for monetary policy in the participating countries will be entrusted to the newly-created European Central Bank. European monetary union must be understood as comprising two separate, but complementary facets: a single currency, and a stable currency. These two facets correspond to the two interrelated objectives of EMU: efficiency and stability. The commitment by national public authorities to meet {{the terms of the}} Treaty on European Union for creating EMU is already bearing important fruit in terms of stability: in the past several years, the convergence towards low inflation has been spectacular and, although more efforts are in order, budget deficits have been substantially reduced. This has resulted in more stable nominal exchange rates and lower long term interest rates, thus paving the way to the current economic recovery. Although EMU represents first and foremost a monetary reform, its implications are much wider. The construction of EMU is geared towards the stability of the new currency, and sound public finances. Together with a well-functioning Single Market, this new policy regime is bound to bring about a new economic environment with fundamental consequences for the behaviour of public and private agents. The gradual elimination of budget deficits, as provided for by the Stability and Growth Pact, implies that government debt, currently still at too high levels, will be set on a consistently downward path. This will have beneficial consequences for interest rates and private investment, help restructuring public expenditure by giving more weight to growth-enhancing factors (such as investment in education and infrastructure), and raise the room for manoeuvre of national budgetary policies in stabilising the <b>cycle.</b> <b>Budgetary</b> discipline will also imply a new, fairer contract between the current and the next generation which will not have to shoulder the burden of today's spending choices. In total, with the change brought about by the EMU regime, the risk of a new stability conflict between the monetary and budgetary policies, which in the past repeatedly contributed to the unsatisfactory growth and employment performance of the Community, could be avoided in the coming years. Private agents, as consumers and producers, will not only benefit from lower transaction costs and simplification entailed by the replacement of multiple national currencies by the euro, but will also see their spectrum of choice broadened. The euro will strengthen the effects of the Single Market due to higher price transparency and greater competition. The relationship between factors of production will also undergo important changes. It will become apparent that if prices and wages are inconsistent with macroeconomic stability and with the Single Market rules, {{there will not be a}} â€œbail outâ€ by public authorities - be it in the form of budgetary handout, looser monetary policy or â€œdefensiveâ€ industrial policies. To the extent that wage and price behaviour anticipate this constraint, EMU will lead to a greater efficiency and higher employment. The changes in behaviour on the part of public authorities and private agents in the new EMU regime are desirable per se, as a means of tackling the structural problems faced by Europe, namely the high and structural unemployment and the budgetary consequences of ageing. Hence EMU acts as a catalyst of changes which would have to take place anyhow to shift the European economies on a path of sustainable growth and high employment. By definition, EMU implies the loss of national monetary autonomy. One of the criticisms often levied against the EMU project is that member countries will not be able to respond to economic disturbances via changes in national monetary policy or in their nominal exchange rate. It is then alleged that negative shocks will result in a surge of unemployment. In reality, the exchange rate, being a â€œnationalâ€ instrument - in that it changes the whole set of domestic prices vis-Ã -vis third countries - is potentially appropriate only in a narrow set of circumstances, namely in the event of shocks affecting the entire national economy and only that economy. If the shock only effects a particular region or sector, a devaluation would lead to over-heating in other parts of the economy. Mutatis mutandis, the same can be said of monetary policy. Shocks that are truly national are already relatively infrequent. And they will become even more so once EMU is in place: The stability-oriented macroeconomic framework will reduce the likelihood of policy-induced shocks (such as disturbances originating in reckless fiscal behaviour), which in the past have been an important source of country-specific shocks. Moreover, the increasing trade interdependence among EMU members will further blur the economic importance of national boundaries, thereby reducing national specificity of economic developments. Admittedly, in those circumstances in which a change in the exchange rate or national monetary policy would have been useful, alternative adjustment channels will have to be provided for in EMU. At the macroeconomic level, a rapid reduction of deficits below the 3 % threshold will create sufficient room for automatic fiscal stabilisers to offset cyclical downturns. Where structural adjustment, rather than mere macro-economic stabilisation is called for, changes in prices and wages will be needed. This requires that product and labour markets operate with greater flexibility. In conclusion, EMU offers important opportunities for better allocation of resources, higher growth and higher employment, but also challenges of completing the necessary budgetary consolidation and stepping up the reforms in product and labour markets. Meeting these challenges will ensure not only the full success of EMU, but will also help in solving Europe's structural problems. macroeconomic policy coordination, emu...|$|R
