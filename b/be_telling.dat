5|$|At about 01:25 on 13 November, in near-complete {{darkness}} {{due to the}} {{bad weather}} and dark moon, the ships of the Imperial Japanese force entered the sound between Savo Island and Guadalcanal and prepared to bombard Henderson Field with the special ammunition loaded for the purpose. The ships arrived from an unexpected direction, coming not down the slot but from {{the west side of}} Savo Island, thus entering the sound from the northwest rather than the north. Unlike their American counterparts, the Japanese sailors had drilled and practiced night fighting extensively, conducting frequent live-fire night gunnery drills and exercises. This experience would <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> in not only the pending encounter, but in several other fleet actions off Guadalcanal in the months to come.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{telephones}} Scully {{and tries}} to explain that he's the real Mulder. Scully does not believe him and asks Fletcher—in Mulder's body—to pick up {{and listen to the}} conversation. Fletcher decides they should immediately report this incident, which further confuses Scully. She goes to Mulder’s apartment (where Fletcher is having a tryst with Kersh's assistant) and tells Fletcher that they traced the telephone call to a pay phone near Area 51 and she suspects it is Mulder's informant. Fletcher is indifferent to this news and Scully yells at him, sensing that his behavior is very strange and his lack of concern for the X-Files is completely out of character. Scully decides to investigate, and drives through the desert towards Area 51. She stops at a burned out gas station and finds a penny and a dime merged. Later, when Scully arrives at Fletcher's house, Mulder tries desperately to convince Scully that he is really Mulder. Scully remains skeptical and thinks that any information Mulder describes could be obtained in other ways. Mulder tells Scully that he will bring proof of the defect of the UFO and the resultant problems that night, but Fletcher, having eavesdropped on the conversation, calls his old office posing as Mulder to inform them of the source of the leak—Mulder posing as Fletcher. Military police arrive at the appointed hour, and Mulder is dragged away, kicking and screaming, desperately trying to convince Scully. Mulder asks if he would turn in an informant to the authorities in this manner as he is carried away, and Scully begins to realize that Mulder may <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> the truth.|$|E

25|$|Engel did {{not agree}} with the committee's report, which {{contained}} proposals {{for the creation of a}} committee to schedule backbench business, the establishment of a committee to set the Commons' agenda and the election of select committee chairs by secret ballot. She felt those three changes would transfer power 'from one elite—in this case, the Executive—and handing it to another—a group of senior Back Benchers'. She also said they would be 'a step in the wrong direction' because they were small changes that would risk standing in the way of more sweeping reforms as MPs would essentially <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> themselves and the public 'we've done , we will move on'. Engel drafted a minority report that proposed restarting the committee's work after the 2010 election, when it would have more time to investigate and deliberate.|$|E

500|$|Joshua Safran had {{initially}} envisioned Alex {{as the one}} of the protagonists of Quantico. When he was writing the character, his personal struggle with not knowing whether one of his family members was a pathological liar or involved with a government agency helped Safran build Alex's perception of her own family. Safran wrote his own experience into Alex's struggle to learn the truth about her father. He said [...] "I've always struggled with knowing that I would never know the truth, because there is no real such thing as the truth with regard to somebody {{who may or may not}} <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> the truth.

500|$|Actress Jennifer Aniston made a guest {{appearance}} on [...] "All Mixed Up". Speculations of her appearance initially surfaced a year {{prior to the}} confirmation, and upon hearing of it, Cougar Town co-creator Bill Lawrence initially supported such allegations. Lawrence stated that he announced that Aniston would appear on the television series, but had not contacted her or her representatives. Eventually, Lawrence averted away from his claims and stated that [...] "nothing's happened yet". He continued in his interview with E! Online: [...] "I'd kill to get Jennifer on the show, and if I had any inclination it was happening, I would <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> everybody 'cause I don't really give a sh-t. I would love it to happen and the second it did I would tell everybody in the world, but nothing's happened." ...|$|E
500|$|In the West, {{political}} leaders have sometimes consulted astrologers. For example, the British intelligence agency MI5 employed Louis de Wohl as an astrologer after claims surfaced that Adolf Hitler used astrology to time his actions. The War Office was [...] "...interested {{to know what}} Hitler's own astrologers would <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> him from week to week." [...] In fact, de Wohl's predictions were so inaccurate that he was soon labelled a [...] "complete charlatan," [...] and later evidence showed that Hitler considered astrology [...] "complete nonsense." [...] After John Hinckley's attempted assassination of US President Ronald Reagan, first lady Nancy Reagan commissioned astrologer Joan Quigley to act as the secret White House astrologer. However, Quigley's role ended in 1988 when it became public through the memoirs of former chief of staff, Donald Regan.|$|E
500|$|On 18 June, after closing speeches from {{prosecution}} and defence counsels, the judge began his summing-up. While emphasising Thorpe's distinguished public record, he was scathing about the principal prosecution witnesses: Bessell was a [...] "humbug", Scott a fraud, a sponger, a whiner, a parasite—"but {{of course he}} could still <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> the truth." [...] Newton was [...] "determined to milk the case {{as hard as he}} can." [...] On 20 June the jury retired; they returned two days later and acquitted the four defendants on all charges. In a brief public statement, Thorpe said that he considered the verdict [...] "a complete vindication." [...] Scott said he was [...] "unsurprised" [...] by the outcome, but was upset by the aspersions on his character made by the judge from the safety of the bench.|$|E

500|$|On {{potential}} crossovers with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Bell said in March 2016, {{in reference}} to the way Hunter and Morse were written off of that series, [...] "We want to be clear we're telling a different type of story, and in doing so, you don't want to <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> a story where you go, [...] "Why don't they call Coulson? He can fix this easily," [...] because that line's been cut. Not that you can't bring them back someday or have someone from S.H.I.E.L.D. show up on this show, but it's really setting up a different [...] universe". Blood described the situation as [...] "they're on their own, they can make up their own rules, just turn the phones on airplane mode and ignore the calls from back home".|$|E
500|$|The Guardian Michael Cragg {{described}} [...] "Sexxx Dreams" [...] as a [...] "Vanity 6-esque strut", and {{dubbed it}} and [...] "Do What U Want", [...] "futuristic, electro-tooled R slow jams with delicious choruses". Robbie Daw of Idolator called the [...] "not so subtle" [...] and [...] "randy" [...] song {{one of the}} album's [...] "standouts", and recommended it {{for use as a}} single. MTV's John Walker said of the song, [...] "There's something so goofily erotic about telling someone 'you were in my sex dreams.' It's such a cumbersome phrase, yet Gaga somehow makes {{it one of the most}} erotic lines you'll heard [...] all year. The half-giggled 'I really shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> you this' line at the song's climax— no pun intended— really seals the deal." [...] Walker humorously rated the song 5 out of 5 [...] "vaguely vaginal Georgia O'Keeffe orchids".|$|E
500|$|Markus and McFeely {{wanted to}} adapt Ed Brubaker's Winter Soldier storyline from the comics, which they {{described}} as [...] "the tone of Cap’s modern franchise", {{but it took}} the duo six months to convince themselves {{that they could do}} it. In the meantime, while thinking how to progress from the war film tone of The First Avenger, the writers settled on the conspiracy genre for the screenplay, and cited Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, and Marathon Man as influences, feeling it better conveyed Captain America's trust issues and contrasting values in the new world he was living in, with Markus saying, [...] "If you put that 1940s man into present day geo-politics everything is going to seem like a conspiracy. It's just going to seem dirty and underhanded and shifty, and people won't <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> the truth." [...] Three Days of the Condor in particular was used as the main source of the script structure, following the idea that the protagonist is being chased by a threat they, along with the audience, only discover halfway through the film.|$|E

500|$|Series creator Joshua Safran {{initially}} {{wanted a}} [...] "straightforward action show" [...] {{different from his}} past work, which included the soapy dramas Gossip Girl and Smash. He revealed {{that he wanted to}} do something with a law enforcement theme such as a political thriller about the NYPD after the September 11 attacks. He based protagonist Alex Parrish, whose complex family history haunts her throughout the series, on a relative; Safran wove his own struggle to understand that family member into Alex's desire to learn the truth about her father. Safran said [...] "I have a family member who either is a pathological liar or has been involved with a government agency my whole life. I've always struggled with knowing that I would never know the truth, because there is no real such thing as the truth with regard to somebody {{who may or may not}} <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> the truth. That struggle informed the character of Alex." [...] He called the series a sexy romance and a political thriller, adding [...] "It's like, what would Die Hard be if Die Hard was weekly and was also a soap".|$|E
500|$|On 18 June {{the judge}} began his summing-up. He drew the jury's {{attention}} to the previous good character of the defendants, whom he characterised as [...] "men of hitherto unblemished reputation." [...] Cantley described Thorpe as [...] "a national figure with a very distinguished public record". The judge was scathing about the principal witnesses: Bessell was a [...] "humbug" [...] whose contract with The Sunday Telegraph was [...] "deplorable"; Scott was a fraud, a sponger, a whiner, a parasite—"but of course he could still <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> the truth. It {{is a question of}} belief." [...] Newton was characterised as a perjurer and a chump, [...] "determined to milk the case as hard as he can." [...] The mystery surrounding the £20,000 that Thorpe had obtained from Hayward was dismissed as an irrelevance: [...] "The fact that a man obtains money by deceit does not [...] that the man {{was a member of a}} conspiracy." [...] Waugh felt that the judge's lack of even-handedness could well provoke a counteraction against the accused from the jury. The summing-up became the subject of a scathing parody by the satirist Peter Cook, written and delivered shortly after the trial at The Secret Policeman's Ball in aid of Amnesty International. Cook's version, according to Freeman and Penrose, was [...] "actually not that different from the original." ...|$|E
500|$|Yet another {{interpretation}} is that Dylan is directing the farewell to himself, particularly his acoustic performer self. The opening line [...] "You must leave now" [...] {{can be a}} command, similar to the line [...] "Go away from my window" [...] that opens [...] "It Ain't Me, Babe". But {{it can also be}} an imperative, meaning just that it is necessary that you leave. And the song is as much about new beginnings as it is about endings. The song not only notes the requirement that Baby Blue leave, but also includes the hope that Baby Blue will move forward, in lines such as [...] "Strike another match, go start anew". If Dylan is singing the song to himself, then he himself would be the [...] "vagabond who's rapping at your door / standing in the clothes that you once wore". That is, the new, electric, surrealist Dylan would be the vagabond, not yet having removed the [...] "clothes" [...] of the old protest singer. Alternatively, the vagabond and [...] "stepping stones" [...] referenced in the song have been interpreted as Dylan's folk audience whom he needs to leave behind. He would also <b>be</b> <b>telling</b> himself to [...] "Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you." [...] Others to whom he may be saying farewell in the song are any of the women he had known, the political left or to the illusions of his youth.|$|E
