5|$|A library {{has been}} present {{since the time}} of StWerburgh's Abbey, and {{following}} the dissolution of the monasteries it became the cathedral library. It continued to grow over the centuries, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 19thcentury it had become neglected. Between 1867 and 1885 it was enlarged and in the 1890s new bookcases were added. A further reorganisation took place in the 1920s <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 1980s the contents were contained in five separate sites around the cathedral. A programme of repair and re-cataloguing of the contents was instituted. During the 2000s more work was carried out and the refurbished library, housed in three rooms, opened in 2007. The library is available for research and for organised visits by groups.|$|E

The resolution of conventional electron microscopy is not limited by electron wavelength, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> large aberrations of electron lenses.|$|E

They were typically located near their fields and walking distance to sources of water. This practice continued into the mid- to late 12th century, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> start of the 13th century they began living in canyon locations that were close to water sources and within walking distance of their fields.|$|E
