It is stable in dry air, <b>but</b> <b>gradually</b> hydrolyses {{in contact with}} moisture to acetic and salicylic acids. In solution with alkalis, the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate.|$|E
5|$|Delaroche's {{early works}} had {{been based on}} topics from the Bible's Old Testament, <b>but</b> <b>gradually</b> his {{interests}} switched to painting scenes from English and French history. He 'combined colouristic skill {{with an interest in}} detailed scenes from history'.Bonaparte Crossing the Alps, which was painted roughly eight years before Delaroche's death, exemplifies this phase in Delaroche's career.|$|E
5|$|At first, most of {{the newly}} settled Normans kept {{household}} knights and did not settle their retainers with fiefs of their own, <b>but</b> <b>gradually</b> these household knights came to be granted lands of their own, {{a process known as}} subinfeudation. William also required his newly created magnates to contribute fixed quotas of knights towards not only military campaigns but also castle garrisons. This method of organising the military forces was a departure from the pre-Conquest English practice of basing military service on territorial units such as the hide.|$|E

5|$|Basin rests {{above the}} Boulder Batholith, the host rock for many {{valuable}} mineral ores {{found in this}} part of Montana. After the town became a hub of gold and silver mining, Basin's population peaked at about 1,500 in first decade of the 20th century <b>but</b> <b>gradually</b> declined as the mines were depleted. Abandoned mining equipment, closed or barricaded mine portals, and the ruins of a smelter and ore concentrator remain in Basin in the 21stcentury.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp left Bowling Green {{to live at}} his father's {{plantation}} in Simpson County, Kentucky, {{where he}} convalesced from an illness. He learned that Cooke had become a recluse nearby at her mother's plantation after her public disgrace. Having heard from a mutual friend about her beauty and accomplishments, he decided to meet Cooke. At first, she rejected all attention, <b>but</b> <b>gradually</b> received Beauchamp under his guise of borrowing books from her library. The two eventually became friends, and, in 1821, began courting. Beauchamp was eighteen years old; Cooke was at least thirty-four.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} in the Saxon duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, to a family {{connected}} to many of Europe's ruling monarchs. At the age of 20, he married his first cousin, Queen Victoria; they had nine children. Initially he felt constrained by his role of consort, which did not afford him any power or responsibilities, <b>but</b> <b>gradually</b> developed a reputation for supporting many public causes, such as educational reform and the abolition of slavery worldwide, and was entrusted with running the Queen's household, office and estates. He was heavily involved with the organisation of the Great Exhibition of 1851, which was a resounding success.|$|E

These helpers lived in the camp and at the sub-camp with the children.|$|E
5|$|Second, it {{was then}} that Japan {{underwent}} a period of intense Westernization in order to compete with other developed countries. Initially architects and styles from abroad were imported to Japan <b>but</b> <b>gradually</b> the country taught its own architects and began to express its own style. Architects returning from study with western architects introduced the International Style of modernism into Japan. However, it was not until after the Second World War that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzo Tange and then with theoretical movements like Metabolism.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} role {{of copper}} has been important, particularly in currency. Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money. At first, the copper itself was valued, <b>but</b> <b>gradually</b> {{the shape and}} look of the copper became more important. Julius Caesar had his own coins made from brass, while Octavianus Augustus Caesar's coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With an estimated annual output of around 15,000t, Roman copper mining and smelting activities reached a scale unsurpassed until {{the time of the}} Industrial Revolution; the provinces most intensely mined were those of Hispania, Cyprus and in Central Europe.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the Soviet Union from 1964 to 1982, {{referred}} to as the Brezhnev Era, covers the period of Leonid Brezhnev's rule of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). This period began with high economic growth and soaring prosperity, <b>but</b> <b>gradually</b> significant problems in social, political, and economic areas accumulated, so that the period is often described as the Era of Stagnation.|$|E
5|$|The merged school began {{developing}} traditions such as Homecoming in 1951, and Red and White Day in 1953. Red and White Day {{eventually became}} a full week of school spirit related activities preceding the annual Male-Manual football game. Two traditions of the sexually segregated past, sororities and the all-male Mitre Club, persisted into the 1950s as unofficial organizations <b>but</b> <b>gradually</b> faded away. Students began publishing a newspaper, The Crimson Record, in 1955.|$|E
5|$|As a Senator, Gravel became {{nationally known}} for his {{forceful}} but unsuccessful attempts to end the draft during the War in Vietnam and for putting the Pentagon Papers into the public record in 1971 at some risk to himself. He conducted an unusual campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1972 for Vice President of the United States, and then {{played a crucial role}} in getting Congressional approval for the Trans-Alaska pipeline in 1973. He was re-elected to the Senate in 1974, <b>but</b> <b>gradually</b> alienated most of his Alaskan constituencies and his bid for a third term was defeated in a primary election in 1980.|$|E

5|$|Fruit body {{primordia}} first appear {{between the}} scales of the cones, and require 9 to 35 days to reach their final height. They consist of an inner core of thin-walled generative hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae. Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate, <b>but</b> <b>gradually</b> become brown as they mature. Because the cap is grown from the stem tip after it bends, cap development interrupts stem growth, and this shift to centrifugal growth (that is, growth outward from the stem) results in the typical kidney-shaped or semicircular cap. Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature, spores production begins within 48–72 hours of the start of cap growth. Spines start out as minute protuberances {{on the part of}} the stem adjoining the undersurface of the cap. As the cap enlarges, these spines are spread horizontally, and more protuberances are formed, which elongate vertically downwards.|$|E
5|$|Ged is {{depicted}} as proud and yet unsure of himself in multiple situations: early in his apprenticeship he believes Ogion to be mocking him, and later, at Roke, feels put upon by Jasper. In both cases, he believes that others do not appreciate his greatness, and Le Guin's sympathetic narration does not immediately contradict this belief. Cadden writes that Le Guin allows young readers to sympathize with Ged, and only gradually {{realize that there is}} a price to be paid for his actions, as he learns to discipline his magical powers. Similarly, as Ged begins his apprenticeship with Ogion, he imagines that he will be taught mysterious aspects of wizardry, and has visions of transforming himself into other creatures, <b>but</b> <b>gradually</b> comes to see that Ogion's important lessons are those about his own self.|$|E
5|$|In 2805, Earth is an {{abandoned}} planet covered in trash, with its people evacuated by megacorporation Buy-N-Large on giant starliners. BnL has left behind WALL-E robot trash compactors to clean up; however, all have since stopped functioning, except one unit who has gained sentience {{and is able}} to stay active using parts from other units. One day, WALL-E discovers a healthy seedling, which he returns to his home. Later, an unmanned spaceship lands and deploys an EVE probe to scan the planet. WALL-E is infatuated with EVE, who is initially hostile <b>but</b> <b>gradually</b> befriends him. When WALL-E brings EVE to his trailer and shows her the plant, however, she suddenly takes the plant and goes into standby mode. WALL-E, confused, unsuccessfully tries to reactivate her. The ship then returns to collect EVE, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner Axiom.|$|E

5|$|Jake Gyllenhaal was {{the first}} to be cast in the film; after {{receiving}} the script, he read it in an hour and immediately contacted Ayer. Michael Peña was cast shortly after, following a string of auditions. He and Gyllenhaal did not bond immediately <b>but</b> <b>gradually</b> became close friends over the process of training and filming. Gyllenhaal and Peña undertook five months of intensive training under the guidance of FitzSimons to prepare for their roles—this included 12-hour ride-alongs with multiple Greater Los Angeles Area law enforcement agencies up to three times a week, as well as training in hand-to-hand combat, police tactics and weapons. On his first ride-along, Gyllenhaal witnessed a murder during a drug bust. Tactical training was also given to the other actors playing police officers, including David Harbour, America Ferrera, Cody Horn, and Frank Grillo.|$|E
5|$|Randall's {{defense of}} smaller, less {{centralized}} government raised his profile among House Democrats, and they elevated him to Speaker in 1876. He held that post until the Democrats {{lost control of}} the House in 1881, and was considered a possible nominee for President in 1880 and 1884. Randall's support for high tariffs began to alienate him from most Democrats, and when that party regained control of the House in 1883, he was denied another term as Speaker. Randall continued to serve in Congress as head of the Appropriations Committee. He remained a respected party leader, <b>but</b> <b>gradually</b> lost influence as the Democrats became more firmly wedded to free trade. Worsening health also curtailed his power until his death in 1890.|$|E
5|$|The Madras Stock Exchange was {{established}} in Madras city in 1920 with a strength of 100 members <b>but</b> <b>gradually</b> faded away and membership had reduced to three by 1923 when {{it had to be}} closed down.

EID Parry manufactured and sold chemical fertilizers and sugar while the Binnys marketed cotton garments and uniforms manufactured at its spinning and weaving facility, the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills in Otteri. Arbuthnot, owned by the Arbuthnot family, was the largest bank in the Presidency until its crash in 1906. Reduced to penury, disillusioned former Indian investors established the Indian Bank with funds donated by Nattukottai Chetties.|$|E
