40|$|The {{application}} of a low cost, commercially available microcomputer as the navigation processor for a simplified OMEGA navigation system {{is an area of}} current research. The interface of a low cost front end OMEGA sensor is described and an example of the phase processing software and navigation routines is given. Emphasis is placed on the description of results obtained with the software version of the OMEGA <b>burst</b> <b>filter</b> known as the memory aided phase locked loop...|$|E
50|$|In Log4j 2, Filters can {{be defined}} on {{configuration}} elements to give more fine-grained control over which log entries should be processed by which Loggers and Appenders. In addition to filtering by log level and regular expression matching on the message string, Log4j 2 added <b>burst</b> <b>filters,</b> time filters, filtering by other log event attributes like Markers or Thread Context Map and JSR 223 script filters.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the error floor of binary frequency-shift keying (FSK) due to intersymbol interference in time-dispersive mobile radio channels, with a limiter-discriminator-integrator detector. The errors {{are caused by}} bursts in the instantaneous frequency. We propose and verify that a nonlinear frequency discriminator can achieve zero error floor for pure FSK by clipping off these <b>bursts.</b> For <b>filtered</b> FSK, the error floor is not completely removed, but strongly reduced - typically by one or two orders of magnitude. The tighter the filtering, the less effective this nonlinearity is. The nonlinear discriminator {{can also be used}} in conjunction with adaptive sampling...|$|R
40|$|Simulations {{of laser}} Doppler {{anemometer}} (LDA) systems have {{focused primarily on}} noise studies or biasing errors. Another possible source of error is the choice of filter types and filter cutoff frequencies. Before it {{is applied to the}} counter portion of the signal processor, a Doppler <b>burst</b> is <b>filtered</b> to remove the pedestal and to reduce noise in the frequency bands outside the region in which the signal occurs. Filtering, however, introduces errors into the measurement of the frequency of the input signal which leads to inaccurate results. Errors caused by signal filtering in an LDA counter-processor data acquisition system are evaluated and filters for a specific application will reduce these errors are chosen...|$|R
40|$|A {{new class}} of signals is {{proposed}} for the rejection of delay-Doppler clutter in radars. The family of signals consists of phase and frequency coded compact pulse <b>bursts.</b> A matched <b>filter</b> receiver is considered and the resulting signal design problem is formulated as a constrained parameter optimization problem. Representative numerical results are presented {{for a variety of}} clutter distributions, which show that in bandwidth-limited situations, the proposed signals perform much better than the standard frequency coded burst...|$|R
40|$|Social media platforms, such as Twitter, offer a {{rich source}} of {{real-time}} information about real-world events, particularly during mass emergencies. Sift-ing valuable information from social media pro-vides useful insight into time-critical situations for emergency officers to understand the impact of haz-ards and act on emergency responses in a timely manner. This work focuses on analyzing Twitter messages generated during natural disasters, and shows how natural language processing and data mining techniques can be utilized to extract sit-uation awareness information from Twitter. We present key relevant approaches that we have inves-tigated including <b>burst</b> detection, tweet <b>filtering</b> and classification, online clustering, and geotagging. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of complex signals may be favoured by hidden preferences or pre-existing sensory biases. Females of {{two species of}} grey treefrogs (Hyla chrysoscelis and Hyla versicolor) were tested with combinations of a conspecific advertisement call and acoustic appendages. Appendages consisted of aggressive calls and segments of advertisement calls from conspecific males and males of three other species and <b>bursts</b> of <b>filtered</b> noise. When {{a wide variety of}} these acoustic appendages followed the advertisement call, the resulting compound signal was often more attractive than the same advertisement call alone. When the same appendages led advertisement calls, however, the compound signal was never more attractive and sometimes less attractive. The order effect was especially strong in tests of H. versicolor in which advertisement-call duration was decreased. These results cannot be explained by a general pre-existing bias for extra stimulation per se. Rather, order and other effects may constrain the evolution and subsequent modification of complex and extravagant signals, examples of which have been reported {{for a wide range of}} taxa...|$|R
40|$|We analyze online {{collective}} evaluation processes through {{positive and}} negative votes in various social media. We find two modes of collective evaluations that stem from the existence of filter bubbles. Above a threshold of collective attention, negativity grows faster with positivity, {{as a sign of}} the <b>burst</b> of a <b>filter</b> bubble when information reaches beyond the local social context of a user. We analyze how collectively evaluated content can reach large social contexts and create polarization, showing that emotions expressed through text play a key role in collective evaluation processes.

40|$|In an {{anechoic}} chamber normal-hearing subjects performed a localization {{task in the}} frontal horizontal plane. The stimulus was a 200 -ms <b>burst</b> of <b>filtered</b> noise. Within a block of trials, half of the presentations (randomly determined) were ``real''—presented from single loudspeakers—and the other half were ``phantoms''—produced by the simultaneous activation of two loudspeakers at ± 30 ° using a virtual source imaging technique [Takeuchi et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 109, 958 – 971 (2001) ]. Both phantom and real sources spanned the azimuthal range ± 80 °. When the stimulus was a 4 kHz low-pass filtered noise, rms error was only slighly higher for phantom (D= 7. 1 °) than for real (D= 5. 5 °) sources. For 8 kHz low-pass filtered noise, performance remained about the same for real sources, but increased for phantom sources (D= 11. 5 °). Data will also be reported for conditions in which the subject's position is systematically varied outside the ``sweet spot. '' Results {{will be discussed in}} terms of robustness of the virtual imaging technique to stimulus and position factors and its potential usefulness as a tool for the investigation of human auditory spatial perception in static and dynamic environments.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{transition}} process of antisite arsenic defects in Be-doped low-temperature-grown GaAs layers {{by measuring the}} magnetization. This material exhibits bistability at non-equilibrium; at a fixed temperature in a fixed magnetic field a sample relaxes towards two different states, depending on the preceding cooling process. We observed anomalously large magnetization fluctuations in macroscopic samples during the transition from bistability to monostability with gradual change of the temperature. Slowing down of the relaxation of the magnetization is observed as a sample approaches the transition into monostability. Large fluctuations observed from a two-piece sample exhibit intermittent <b>bursts</b> by high-pass <b>filtering</b> and follow a generalized Gumbel probability density distribution. These observations suggest a possibility of the occurrence of a non-equilibrium critical point in this material. Microscopic processes underlying the observed phenomena are discussed with results of first-principles calculations of strain fields...|$|R
50|$|Users {{can take}} actions to <b>burst</b> through their <b>filter</b> bubbles. Some make a {{conscious}} effort to evaluate what information they are exposing themselves to, thinking critically about whether they are engaging with a broad range of content. Steps to “re-engineer your internet diet” include creating your own research team of smart, insightful media leaders who wisely consume and produce only valid and credible articles. Users can examine their search history and cut sources that are unverifiable or weak. This view argues that users should change the psychology of how they approach media with their biases already intact instead of relying on a tech to erase their biases. Tech {{can also be used to}} combat filter bubbles. Chris Glushko, the VP of Marketing at IAB, advocates using fact-checking sites like Snopes.com to eradicate the occurrence of fake news.|$|R
40|$|Measurements of the {{particle}} size and velocity in a gas-solid two-phase flow using the phase-Doppler technique based on transient recorder data processing and the cross-spectral density (CSD) function are improved in accuracy by introducing new complex interpolat on functions to the discrete frequency lines. The improvements of the accuracy for size and velocity measurements are additionally {{based on the}} use of an external electronic unit, which is allowed to trigger the transient recorder near the peak of the envelope of the band-pass <b>filtered</b> <b>bursts.</b> This procedure could improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the processed part of the signal and hence the accuracy and data rate. Furthermore, any uncertainty in setting a predefined trigger level could be avoided. Especially in complex flows where regions of low velocity exist, a very accurate velocity estimation is necessary {{in order to reduce the}} relative error. A simultaneous measurement of the gas velocity is achieved by seeding the flow with small spherical glass beads which have the same refractive index as the dispersed phase particles. The identification of signals from these seeding particles - with a diameter less than 4 -mu-m - is based on the phase between the two signals...|$|R
40|$|Complex tone <b>bursts</b> were {{bandpass}} <b>filtered,</b> 22 nd– 30 th harmonic, {{to produce}} waveforms with five regularly occurring envelope peaks ("pitch pulses") that evoked pitches {{associated with their}} repetition period. Two such tone bursts were presented sequentially and separated by an interpulse interval (IPI). When the IPI was varied, the pitch of the whole sequence was shifted by between + 2 % and – 5 %. When the IPI was greater than one period, little effect was seen. This {{is consistent with a}} pitch mechanism employing a long integration time for continuous stimuli that resets in response to temporal discontinuities of greater than about one period of the waveform. Similar pitch shifts were observed for fundamental frequencies from 100 to 250 Hz. The pitch shifts depended on the IPI duration relative to the period of the complex, not on the absolute IPI duration. The pitch shifts are inconsistent with the autocorrelation model of Meddis and O'Mard [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 102, 1811 – 1820 (1997) ], although {{a modified version of the}} weighted mean-interval model of Carlyon et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 112, 621 – 633 (2002) ] was successful. The pitch shifts suggest that, when two pulses occur close together, one of the pulses is ignored on a probabilistic basis...|$|R
40|$|The {{filter bank}} {{multicarrier}} (FBMC) technique {{has been proposed}} in the FP 7 European research program, as an enhancement to the OFDM technique for future broadband radio systems. Besides gains in efficiency, mainly due {{to the absence of}} cyclic prefix, an important feature of FBMC is the absence of spectral leakage, which makes it particularly appealing for cognitive radio. However, in <b>burst</b> transmission, the <b>filter</b> impulse response introduces transitions which extend the length of the burst with respect to OFDM and may reduce the gains in efficiency. After a brief overview of the FBMC technique, the exploitation in burst transmission is discussed. The effect of cutting the initial and final transitions of the burst is investigated. The level of temporary spectral leakage introduced by this operation is assessed It is shown that cuts leading to an increase in burst length of half a symbol with respect to OFDM affect the first and the last symbol only, resulting in a minor reduction in bit loading for these symbols. Application to the time division duplex access mode is considered, as well as the case of the presence of a preamble in the burst. For implementation, it is proposed to resort to a simple memory preloading technique, which has the advantage of compatibility with OFDM in dual mode systems...|$|R
50|$|The imager was an {{intensified}} Thompson CCD {{camera with}} a six position filter wheel. The set of filters {{consisted of a}} broad-band filter with a bandpass of 400 to 800 nm, four narrow-band filters with center wavelengths (and bandpass width (FWHM)) of 415 nm (40 nm), 560 nm (10 nm), 650 nm (10 nm), and 750 nm (20 nm), and 1 opaque cover to protect the image intensifier. The field of view was 0.3 x 0.4 degrees, translating to a width of about 2 km at a nominal lunar altitude of 400 km. The image array is 288 &times; 384 pixels, (pixel size of 23 &times; 23 micrometers) so the pixel resolution at the Moon was 7 - 20 m depending on the spacecraft altitude. (At Geographos the resolution would have been <5 m at closest approach.) The clear aperture was 131 mm and the focal length was 1250 mm. The nominal imaging rate was about 10 frames per second in individual image <b>bursts</b> covering all <b>filters</b> at the Moon. The high resolution and small field of view only allowed coverage of selected areas of the Moon, {{in the form of}} either long, narrow strips of a single color or shorter strips of up to four colors. The instrument has a signal to noise ratio of 13 to 41 depending on the albedo and phase angle, with a 1% relative calibration and a 20% absolute calibration, and a dynamic range of 2000.|$|R
