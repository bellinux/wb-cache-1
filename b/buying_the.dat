5|$|Cope {{travels with}} Knight to Europe; Knight with the {{intention}} of visiting Paris zoos, Cope with the intent of selling off much of his bone collection. Cope has also spent much of his money <b>buying</b> <b>The</b> American Naturalist, a paper in which he plans to attack Marsh's dealings. Hatcher arrives in New York to talk about the find Laelaps; in his speech, he subtly hints at the folly of Marsh's elitism and backstabbing, as well as Cope's collecting obsession.|$|E

A radio show host on WSCR made the suggestion that Birck should <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> team. Birck told the Chicago Sun-Times: [...] "It was kind of amusing.

5|$|Large {{numbers of}} people participated in solving the puzzles within the ARG.

5|$|The pier is {{designated}} by English Heritage as a GradeII listed building, {{due to its}} status as the oldest surviving pier created by Eugenius Birch.

5|$|The {{stadium is}} owned by Manchester City Council and leased by the {{football}} club. The 2008 takeover made the football club {{one of the wealthiest}} in the world, prompting suggestions that it could consider <b>buying</b> <b>the</b> stadium outright. Manchester City signed an agreement with Manchester City Council in March 2010 to allow a £1 billion redevelopment led by architect Rafael Viñoly.|$|E
5|$|Tickets for {{the match}} had been selling for £500 {{in the lead}} up to the game.

5|$|Troy's {{downtown}} began reviving. In 1993, Martin Scorsese {{used the}} Second Street area, particularly the Paine Mansion, {{and some of}} the Russell Sage buildings as locations for his adaptation of Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence, since they replicated the appearance of 1870s Manhattan. River Street became home to many antique stores. Developers began <b>buying</b> <b>the</b> old buildings and adapting them to contemporary uses.|$|E

5|$|What {{is utterly}} dismaying is the mess our milling and baking {{concerns}} succeed in making with the dearly bought grain {{that goes into}} their grist.

5|$|A major {{planning}} {{issue was}} {{the need for a}} minicomputer at the station. NDRE argued that it was fully capable of delivering such a system, but NTNF instead wanted to minimize risk by <b>buying</b> <b>the</b> PDP-8 from Digital Equipment Corporation in the United States. However, NDRE was awarded the contract, in part because of NTNF's obligation to support Norwegian technology and in part because NDRE agreed to purchase a suitable foreign computer if they could not successfully manufacture one themselves. A new minicomputer, SAM-2, was built at NDRE and completed in April 1967. It was the first computer built in Europe and among the first three in the world which used integrated circuits. SAM-2 was so successful that the developers established Norsk Data to commercialize the technology.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{only about}} $15,000 from the {{building}} fund was still available since money had already been spent on <b>buying</b> <b>the</b> property and materials from the Mellon Mansion. Further fund raising generated 1,200 pledges, 95 percent of which were fulfilled: 60 {{percent of the money}} came from 10 percent of the parishioners and approximately 10 percent of the people did not contribute at all. During this time, all of the books concerning the finances of the construction of the new church were kept by ladies of the St. Peter's Cenacle. The ladies not only recorded all of the pledges and collections, but they also recorded all notices and minutes from their meetings. While the church was being built, the Campaigners met almost every evening.|$|E

5|$|Behind {{the coup}} were almost {{certainly}} the Byzantines, who had every interest in removing a dangerous enemy and replacing him with somebody, if {{not from a}} pro-Byzantine faction, at least less actively aggressive. Gian Piero Bognetti advances a few hypotheses about Helmichis' motivation for his coup: his reason could have involved a family link to the Lethings, the Lombard royal dynasty that had been dispossessed by Alboin's father Audoin; or {{he may have been}} related through Amalafrid to the Amali, the leading dynasty of the Goths. Helmichis easily obtained the support of the Lombards in Verona, and he probably hoped to sway all the warriors and Lombard dukes to his side by having Alboin's only child, Albsuinda, under his control. He may also have hoped for Byzantine help in <b>buying</b> <b>the</b> dukes' loyalty economically.|$|E
5|$|Bell {{was then}} an {{employee}} of the Ritz-Carlton in Philadelphia. At one point, he tried his hand as a stock broker and lost $50,000 (presently, $) during the Wall Street Crash of 1929. His father bailed him out of his deprivation, and he returned to working at the Ritz. From 1930 until 1932, he was a backfield coach for the Temple Owls football team. In 1932, Marshall tried to coax Bell into <b>buying</b> <b>the</b> rights to a NFL franchise, but Bell disparaged the league and ridiculed the idea. When Pop Warner was hired to coach Temple for the 1933 season, Warner chose to hire his own assistants and Bell was let go.|$|E
5|$|Between 1820 and 1828 {{the earl}} had {{converted}} the abandoned tennis {{court and the}} Castle Inn – which he closed in 1812 after <b>buying</b> <b>the</b> castle – into a new, grand building, called Castle House, overlooking {{the north side of}} the outer bailey. By the 1840s the house had been leased out, first to George Hodges and his family, and then to William Urwick and to Robert Marston, all important members of the local landowning classes. The mansion included a drawing room, dining room, study, servants' quarters, a conservatory and grapevines, and in 1887 was worth £50 a year in rent.|$|E
