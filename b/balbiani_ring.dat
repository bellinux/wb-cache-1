Anti-topoisomerase I IgG had less effect on RNA polymerase II-promoted activity of other less efficiently transcribing heterogeneous nuclear RNA genes. The pattern of inhibition of growing nascent <b>Balbiani</b> <b>ring</b> chains indicated that the transcriptional process was interrupted at the level of chain elongation. The highly decondensed state of active <b>Balbiani</b> <b>ring</b> chromatin, however, remained unaffected after injection of topoisomerase I antibodies.

40|$|The fine {{structure}} and cytochemistry of the extremely large RNA puffs, or Balbiani rings, in salivary gland nuclei of midge, Chironomus thummi, larvae have been investigated. The Balbiani rings {{are composed of}} a diffuse mass of electron-opaque 400 to 500 A granules, short threads about 180 to 220 A in diameter and associated fine chromatin fibrils. These components appear to be organized into brushlike elements which form the ring. Electron microscope cytochemistry {{has shown that the}} granules and short threads contain RNA. After ribonuclease digestion, only 50 to 100 A chromatin fibrils were apparent in the <b>Balbiani</b> <b>ring,</b> and the granules were no longer demonstrable. Deoxyribonuclease digestion had no apparent effect on these structures. Observations indicate that the granules are formed from the short threads and released into the nucleoplasm in which they are evenly distributed. At the nuclear envelope, many granules have been observed partially or completely within the nuclear pores. These granules become elongated and are shown to penetrate the center of the pore in a rodlike form, about 200 A in diameter. The <b>Balbiani</b> <b>ring</b> granules are not normally visible within the cytoplasm adjacent to the nuclear envelope, but have been rarely found in this region. It is suggested that the granules represent the product of the <b>Balbiani</b> <b>ring,</b> possibly a messenger RNA bound to protein, and that they regularly pass into the cytoplasm through a narrow central channel in the pores of the nuclear envelope...|$|E

40|$|Polysomes {{from the}} salivary glands of Chironomus tentans were {{investigated}} {{to determine whether}} <b>Balbiani</b> <b>ring</b> 75 S RNA is incorporated into polysomal structures, and thus probably acts as messenger RNA. A new extraction technique for obtaining ribonucleoproteins was applied that gives a high yield of polysomes with only moderate degradation of the cytoplasmic, high molecular weight RNA. The polysomes sedimented in a broad region (200 - 2, 000 S) with a peak value of about 700 S, which suggested that they were partly of very large sizes. This was confirmed by visualization of the polysomes in the electron microscope: 400 S polysomes contained mainly 11 - 16 ribosomes, and 1, 500 S polysomes about 60 ribosomes per polysome. However, polysomes containing 100 or more ribosomes were also observed.

40|$|<b>Balbiani</b> <b>rings</b> (BR), giant puffs in Chironomus larval salivary glands, {{code for}} giant {{secretory}} proteins. As shown earlier, the normally dominant BR 2 {{is turned off}} with its putative translation product during exposure of larvae to compounds that diminish the stores of Pi. A BR 6 develops from a compact chromosome band, and a new giant protein appears in the secretion as the major component. We have determined the sequence of cloned DNA fragments representative for large parts of BR 1 and BR 2 (normally active) and the inducible BR 6. There is an excess of positive charges and high contents of serine/threonine in the coded amino acid composition for the BR 1 and BR 2 sequences. The coded amino acid sequence for the BR 6 clone shares homologies with the others but has an excess of negative charges and lacks serine/threonine. This suggested that the Pi effects observed earlier {{could be related to}} differences in phosphorylation between the normal proteins and the BR 6 product. This could be confirmed by measurements of phosphorylation, which occurs in the normal giant proteins mainly at seryl residues.

40|$|Drosophila B 52 {{protein is}} a {{homologue}} of human ASF/SF 2 that functions in vitro {{as an essential}} pre-mRNA splicing factor. Immunofluorescence analysis of polytene chromosomes has shown that B 52 generally colocalizes with RNA polymerase II; however, in contrast to other splicing factors, B 52 brackets RNA polymerase II at highly active heat-shock puffs. Also, UV cross-linking in nonpolytene cells has shown that B 52 cross-links in vivo to DNA flanking the highly active transcription units. Here, {{we find that the}} distribution of cross-linked B 52 at heat-shock loci depends on transcription levels. Heat shocks at low and moderate temperatures, which induce corresponding levels of transcription, recruit B 52 both to transcribed DNA and to flanking DNA, whereas a full heat-shock induction concentrates B 52 on the DNA that brackets the entire activated region. We have also identified a 46 -kDa protein from Chironomus tentans that binds Drosophila B 52 antibodies and has a distribution on chromosomes analogous to B 52. This protein is found throughout the moderately transcribed <b>Balbiani</b> <b>rings.</b> However, when transcription at these rings is hyperinduced to levels comparable to fully induced Drosophila heat-shock genes, the protein is restricted to the boundaries of highly decondensed chromatin.

40|$|Recently, we {{developed}} the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) -immunogold technique for in situ detection of DNA molecules. In this study the potential value and {{the limitations of}} the method were evaluated using the giant polytene chromosomes from Chironomus tentans salivary glands. Emphasis was put on the <b>Balbiani</b> <b>rings</b> (BRs), specialized chromosomal sites with exceptionally intense synthesis of large mRNA molecules. Immunolabeling was recorded not only over the bands and interbands of the polytene chromosomes but also over the BR structures. In the BRs, gold particles were present over segments of active transcription units, each with a central chromatin axis and a number of growing RNP products attached to the axis. One third of the transversely sectioned transcription units showed labeling in the central parts, i. e., where the unfolded chromatin axis is located, whereas the growing RNP fibers remained unlabeled. The absence of labeling of the RNP fibers {{is not likely to be}} due to lack of accessibility, because anti-RNA antibodies readily decorated the RNP fibers. The nuclear sap and cytoplasm displayed no significant label.

Due to the presence of polytene (‘giant’) salivary gland chromosomes, it is possible to define the genome response of several Chironomid species to various stress agents. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the genotoxic changes in populations of widely distributed chironomid species from aquatic basins in Bulgaria, Italy, Russia, U. K. and Poland, which were exposed to high concentrations of trace metals. We analyzed the structural and functional alterations of polytene chromosomes of the salivary glands of larvae belonging to three different cytocomplexes of the genus Chironomus (“thummi”, “lacunarius”, “pseudothummi”), and genera Glyptotendipes and Kiefferulus. Somatic structural chromosome rearrangements (para- and pericentric heterozygous inversions, deletions, deficiencies and amplifications) were used to estimate a Somatic index (S) for each population. The highest S indexes were detected in Chironomus riparius populations from locations with high concentrations of trace metals in the sediment. Each species showed specific genome responses to stress agents which we discussed in the light of the specific DNA structures and cytogenetic characteristics of the species. In larvae from polluted sediments two key structures of the salivary gland chromosomes (<b>Balbiani</b> <b>Rings</b> and Nucleolar Organizer) sharply reduced their activity to levels below those observed under non-polluted conditions. It is concluded that polytene chromosomes can be used as tools for evaluating the genotoxicity of the aquatic environment. Structural and functional chromosome alterations provide cost-effective early-warning signals of genotoxic concentrations of environmental pollutants. doi: 10. 5324 /fn. v 31 i 0. 1355.

40|$|The {{structure}} and intracellular flow of specific RNA-associated proteins have been characterized in the salivary gland {{cells in the}} dipteran Chironomus tentans. These cells contain four polytene chromosomes (I-IV), two of which harbour a nucleolus. The chromosomal sites active in pre-messenger RNA transcription are called chromosomal puffs; some of the puffs are especially conspicuous and are designated <b>Balbiani</b> <b>rings</b> (BRs). The pre-messenger ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles in BRs 1 and 2 can be visualized in the electron microscope during assembly on the BR genes and during transport to and through the nuclear pores. In the present studies, monoclonal antibodies were raised against single-stranded DNA binding proteins extracted from nuclei of C. tentans tissue culture cells. The antibodies were used to select cDNA clones from C. tentans expression libraries, and subsequent DNA sequence analysis revealed the primary structure of the proteins. The antibodies were also applied in immunocytology and immunoelectron microscopy studies. Three proteins, hrp 36, hrp 45 and hrp 23, are present in BR 1 - 2 pre-mRNP particles. The hrp 36 protein was shown to contain two RNA-binding domains and an auxiliary glycine-rich domain. The protein {{is added to the}} BR transcript concomitant with transcription and remains associated with the transcript in the nucleoplasm, during the transport through the nuclear pores, and even during protein synthesis in the cytoplasm. These observations strongly suggested that hrp 36 is involved in RNA export. The hip 45 protein has two RNA-binding domains and an auxiliary domain rich in serine and arginine. The protein proved to be homologous to some members of the SR protein family. The hrp 45 protein reaches the nuclear pore complex bound to the RNA, but when the transcript enters the central channel of the nuclear pore complex, the protein is released from the particle. The results suggested that hrp 45 acts as a structural protein bound to exonic RNA during splicing and could exert additional functions. The hrp 23 protein has only one RNA-binding domain and its auxiliary domain is rich in glycine, arginine and serine. The hrp 23 protein is bound to the growing BR transcripts and is present in the BR RNP particles in the nucleoplasm. However, hrp 23 could not be detected in the BR particles bound to the nuclear pore complex, indicating that the hrp 23 is released just prior to or at the binding of the particles to the pore complex. Taken together, the studies of the pre-mRNA binding proteins hrp 36, hrp 45 and hrp 23 show that each protein exhibits a distinct flow pattern, probably related to the particular function of each protein in the maturation andlor transport of BR pre-mRNA. A BR 3 -specific protein, hrp 130, was shown to be a new protein with no known RNA-binding sequence motif. Its specific chromosomal location indicated that hrpl 30 binds to RNA with high sequence preference. The nucleolar 95 kD protein proved to be a phosphoprotein located in the fibrillar portion of the nucleoli. The amino-terminal and central part of the protein consists of alternating acidic and basic regions, and the carboxy-terminal part contains frequent arginine- glycine-glycine or phenylalanine-glycine-glycine tripeptides.

Here we show that BR 2 {{is more complex than}} hitherto believed, containing two 75 S RNA-producing genes, BR 2 a and BR 2 b, present in different 35 – 40 kb blocks of DNA. The transcripts hybridizing to two different repeat units originating in BR 2 differ in size. Further support for the presence of two genes comes from RNA studies during experimentally induced BR 2 regression.

40|$|Gene {{expression}} in eukaryotic organisms commences with {{the synthesis of}} a precursor RNA, which has to be extensively processed to yield a mature RNA molecule. In addition to processing, the RNA molecule needs to associate with a proper set of proteins. Some of these proteins mediate structure, some {{are involved in the}} maturation and export processes, and others might not have a function before entering the cytoplasm. The significance of a correct protein composition of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle remains to be explored. The RNP particle requires transport from the site of transcription, through the nucleoplasm and the nuclear pore complex (NPC), to the cytoplasm, where messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are translated into protein and ribosomal RNPs (rRNPs) form mature ribosomes. The NPC and its components are likely {{to be involved in the}} regulation of RNA export by interacting specifically with export substrates. We have used the unique properties of the larvae of the dipteran Chironomus tentans to study the relation of four proteins to the biogenesis of mRNA in situ. The salivary gland cells contain polytene chromosomes with the transcriptionally active regions blown up as puffs. A few giant puffs, called <b>Balbiani</b> <b>rings</b> (BRs), generate large RNP particles that can be visualised in the electron microscope (EM) during assembly on the gene and transport to and through the NPCs. We have found that a putative translational regulator, Ct-p 40 / 50, was loaded onto nascent BR pre-mRNA transcripts already during transcription. In addition, it was present in many other chromosomal loci, suggesting that Ct-p 40 / 50 is a general RNA binding protein. Ct-p 40 / 50 also appeared in the nucleoplasm and was abundant in the cytoplasm. In both compartments, it was bound to poly(A) + RNA. Ct-p 40 / 50 accompanied the BR transcript all the way through the nucleoplasm to the nuclear pores and into the cytoplasm, where it was mainly present in polysomes. We conclude that the cotranscriptional loading of a putative translational regulator represents an early programming of the cytoplasmic fate of mRNA. The nuclear poly(A) binding protein PABPN 1, known to regulate the length of the poly(A) tail was found to be associated with RNA polymerase (pol) II along the chromatin axis of the BR gene. After transcription, PABPN 1 associated with the transcript and accompanied the BR mRNP to the NPC. A small fraction of the protein was found in the cytoplasm, suggesting that PABPN 1 is displaced from mRNPs during or shortly after passage through the NPC. Our results suggest that the assembly of PABPN 1 onto the poly(A) tail is coupled to transcription. We have characterised a protein that specifically recognises one of the transcriptional BR puffs, the BR 3. The protein was designated Ct-hrp 130 and showed a sequence organisation strikingly similar to the human transcriptional regulator CA 150. The BR 3 gene is especially rich in introns, and we suggest that Ct-hrp 130, like CA 150, can down-regulate transcription. This would enable splicing of the BR 3 gene to occur cotranscriptionally. Injection of an antibody to the NPC component Nup 153 caused accumulation of both mRNA and rRNA in the nucleoplasm. Analysis by EM revealed that the mRNP particles bound to the top of the basket structure, while particles already engaged in translocation through the NPC completed their passage. This demonstrated that the block occurred at a stage between the binding of the export substrate to the NPC and its translocation through the pore. The fact that rRNA and mRNA accumulated in the nucleoplasm and that no RNPs lined up in front of the pore argues for a random movement of export substrates to the pore. We suggest that Nup 153 is directly involved in the translocation process of mRNA and rRNA through the NPC at a stage right before the cargo enters the basket of the NPC. In summary, we have studied specific aspects of the assembly and transport of messenger and ribosomal RNP particles. The PABPN 1 protein was present already on the RNA polymerase II, suggesting that it can be transferred from the polymerase onto the poly(A) tail of the transcript concomitant with transcription. At certain genes, the Ct-hrp 130 protein might slow down transcription of intron-rich transcripts to enable splicing to take place cotranscriptionally. When an antibody to Nup 153 was injected into nuclei, export of messenger and ribosomal RNA was specifically blocked at a stage before the entry of the RNPs into the basket of the NPC, indicating that Nup 153 is acting at the top of the basket. The cotranscriptional loading of certain proteins, like the putative translational regulator Ct-p 40 / 50, onto nascent RNA suggests an early programming of not only the nuclear but also the cytoplasmic fate of the mRNA...|$|R

Hybridization of RNA dot-blots with an oligonucleotide probe indicated that the observed increase in sp 180 was preceded by a parallel 20 -fold increase in the steady state level of its mRNA beginning between stages 7 and 8.

The complexity of BR granule 75 S RNA was studied by agarose gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions. We recorded three main bands, designated I, II and III. Experiments with denaturing gels demonstrated that the differences in migration reflected mainly, but not exclusively, conformational differences. Northern blotting experiments showed that band I contained BR 1 sequences, band II contained BR 2. 1 sequences, and band III contained BR 2. 2 sequences. To study whether additional genes contributed to the BR granule 75 S RNA, an RNA band shift assay was developed. When an oligodeoxyribonucleotide complementary to repetitive BR 1 and BR 2. 2 sequences was hybridized to 75 S RNA prior to electrophoresis, bands I and III were retarded but not band II. An oligonucleotide complementary to a repetitive BR 2. 1 sequence only shifted band II. Since no detectable 75 S RNA remained unchanged in these experiments, and all bands were identified by Northern blotting, all the BR granules are likely to originate from the BR 1, BR 2. 1 and BR 2. 2 genes; no additional genes have to be invoked. Possible applications of the new RNA band shift assay are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A clone {{derived from}} the <b>Balbiani</b> <b>ring</b> b (BRb) gene of Chironomus thummi {{has been used to}} study the {{internal}} organization of that gene. Much of the gene consists of approximately 80 copies of a ca. 300 bp repeat unit, which are tandemly organized. The BRb clone contains a major part of that unit (242 bp). Sequence analysis shows that approximately 60 % of the unit corresponds to short, tandemly organized subsequences, which encode peptides 8 to 11 residues long. In turn, each subsequence consists of even shorter internal repeats, corresponding to a tripeptide (consensus Proline. Serine. Lysine.). The remainder of the ca. 300 bp unit probably does not have obvious repetitive substructure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Three-dimensional (3 -D) reconstructions, by {{electron}} microscope tomography, of selectively stained, contrast enhanced <b>Balbiani</b> <b>Ring</b> (BR) hnRNP granules reveal a complex spatial arrangement of RNA-rich do-mains. This particulate substructure was examined by volume rendering computer graphics. Modeling the ar-rangement of RNA-rich domains is made difficult by apparent structural flexibility and/or heterogeneity of composition. Formulation of a consensus 3 -D arrange-ment of RNA-rich domains will require an expanded data base of reconstructed BR granules and the develop-ment of new image manipulation and analysis tech-niques. This study demonstrates {{the potential for}} ultra-structural cell biology of combining several new tech-niques: selective nucleic acid staining, electron spectro-scopic imaging to enhance contrast, {{electron microscope}} tomography and volume rendering computer graphics...|$|E
40|$|A {{major part}} of <b>Balbiani</b> <b>ring</b> (BR) c DNA of Chironomus thummi {{consists}} of tandem 249 -bp repeats which appear to be transcribed and translated into a polypeptide of very unusual composition. Whereas these 2549 -bp repeats are evident by Southern blotting, sequence analysis reveals a finer tandemly repetitive substructure: {{more than half of}} the 249 -bp repeat length consists of tandem 24 -bp subrepeats, and these in turn may have been generated from even shorter sequences. Comparisons with partial BRb and BR 1 sequences reveal that this hierarchically repetitive sequence structure is typical of BR genes. It resembles the structure of some satellite sequences, suggesting that mechanisms leading to satellite DNA evolution may also operate in the evolution of structural genes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{expression}} of a <b>Balbiani</b> <b>ring</b> 1 gene that codes for a salivary gland-specific 180 -kD secretory polypeptide (spl 80) is regulated developmentally. Immunoblots of salivary gland protein incubated with an affinity-purified nonapeptide-reactive antibody demonstrated that the salivary gland content of spl 80 increases as much as 10 -fold between stages 8 and 10 of the fourth larval instar. Hybridization of RNA dotblots with an oligonucleotide probe indicated that the observed increase in spl 80 was preceded by a parallel 20 -fold increase in the steady state level of its mRNA beginning between stages 7 and 8. In vitro nuclear transcription experiments demonstrated {{that there was a}} 10 -fold acceleration in the rate of spl 80 gene tran-scription between stages 6 and 10. The limited perio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the {{salivary glands}} of the {{dipteran}} Chironomus tentans, a specific messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particle, the <b>Balbiani</b> <b>ring</b> (BR) granule, can be visualized during its assembly on the gene and during its nucleocytoplasmic transport. We now show with immunoelectron microscopy that actin becomes {{associated with the}} BR particle concomitantly with transcription and {{is present in the}} particle in the nucleoplasm. DNase I affinity chromatography experiments with extracts from tissue culture cells indicate that both nuclear and cytoplasmic actin are bound to the heterogeneous RNP (hnRNP) protein hrp 36, but not to the hnRNP proteins hrp 23 and hrp 45. The interaction is likely to be direct as purified actin binds to recombinant hrp 36 in vitro. Furthermore, it is demonstrated by cros...|$|E

Mature <b>Balbiani</b> <b>Ring</b> (BR) {{granules}} in situ were {{stained with}} the nucleic acid specific stain, osmium ammine-B, recorded by electron spectroscopic imaging and reconstructed byelectron microscope tomography {{to examine the}} three-dimensional (3 -D) distribution of BR heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). The BR 2 gran-ules contain ca. 37 kb of mRNA. Reconstructed BR granules were selected to emphasize one of the prevalent conformations seen in the sectioned salivary glands, the enface or "pin-wheel " conformation. A variety of image processing and volume-rendering operations were ap-plied to the set of reconstructed BR granules. Some of the conclusions {{of this study are}} the following: (1) RNA distribution is not uniform throughout the granule; (2) RNA is condensed into about ten particles per granule...|$|E

40|$|Nucleocytoplasmic export and biogenesis of mRNPs {{are closely}} coupled. At the gene, {{concomitant}} with {{synthesis of the}} pre-mRNA, the transcription machinery, hnRNP proteins, processing, quality control and export machineries cooperate to release processed and export competent mRNPs. After diffusion through the interchromatin space, the mRNPs are translocated through the nuclear pore complex and released into the cytoplasm. At the nuclear pore complex, defined compositional and conformational changes are triggered, but specific cotranscriptionally added components are retained in the mRNP and subsequently influence the cytoplasmic fate of the mRNP. Processes taking place at the gene locus and at the nuclear pore complex are crucial for integrating export as {{an essential part of}} gene expression.

40|$|AbstractIn the larval {{salivary glands}} of C. tentans, it is {{possible}} to visualize by electron microscopy how <b>Balbiani</b> <b>ring</b> (BR) pre-mRNA associates with proteins to form pre-mRNP particles, how these particles move to and through the nuclear pore, and how the BR RNA is engaged in the formation of giant polysomes in the cytoplasm. Here, we study C. tentans hrp 36, an abundant protein in the BR particles, and establish that it is similar to the mammalian hnRNP A 1. By immunoelectron microscopy it is demonstrated that hrp 36 is added to BR RNA concomitant with transcription, remains in nucleoplasmic BR particles, and is translocated through the nuclear pore still associated with BR RNA. It appears in the giant BR RNA–containing polysomes, where it remains as an abundant protein in spite of ongoing translation...|$|E

In the present study, we identify and characterize a new protein component in the BR ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles, designated hrp 23. The protein with a molecular mass of 20 kD has a single RNA-binding domain and a glycine-arginine-serine–rich auxiliary domain.
