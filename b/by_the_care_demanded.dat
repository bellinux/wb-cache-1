40|$|Low {{referral}} {{rates for}} {{a considerable number of}} years among publicly insured Urk residents were the reason for setting up this study. Urk is a former island in the IJsselmeer, a lake in {{the central part of the}} Netherlands. Chapter 1 describes the history of Urk, the population characteristics and mentality and its health care facilities. Studying literature on the subject (chapter 2) resulted in an analytical model and the conclusion that an extensive inventory of the health condition (self-reported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> population), <b>care</b> <b>demand</b> (GP consultation), use of care (number of consultations and subsequent interventions) and factors that influenced the population and the GPs as for <b>care</b> <b>demand</b> and use of care, was worth doing. The Dutch national survey of general practice (1987 - 1988) would provide the tools and could serve as reference. The consequences are explained in chapter 3 : a questionnaire among (a sample of) the population, a questionnaire among GPs, and registration of all consultations and interventions in the GP practices for a period of three months. The registration is episode-orientated, an episode being a number of consultations for the same health problem. Questionnaire data of the population sample about use of care, health condition, determinants of health and attitude were compared with the figures of the Dutch national survey or with figures of the Central Bureau for Statistics or with both. Consultation registration data about <b>care</b> <b>demand</b> and use of <b>care</b> in <b>the</b> GP practice were standardized per practice as for the Dutch population structure (age and gender). In order to limit the consequences of diagnostic inter-doctor variation for the comparison between Urk and the Netherlands as much as possible, diagnoses were clustered to an advanced level. Differences between Urk and the Netherlands were only tested in 20 or more episodes in Urk. The data collection for the study took place in the autumn of 1991. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} social sustainability in the psychological profession. The key element that distinguishes the approach centered on sustainability is that the psychologist defines and represents him/herself as a consultant serving community, {{and not as a}} technician or a professional who works for individuals. In this sense, his/her professional intervention will never be a purely technical response, not even an answer on the problem through a bespoke approach, but it will be an answer that will take into account the whole relational, social, cultural, historical, and economic context that has produced <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>demand.</b> Keywords:Social sustainability; Psychological profession; Psychological demand analysis</p...|$|R
40|$|Background Employment {{participation}} of mothers {{of young children}} has steadily increased in developed nations. Combining work and family roles can create conflicts with family life, but can also bring enrichment. Work–family conflict and enrichment experienced by mothers may also impact children’s home environments via parenting behaviour and the couple relationship, particularly {{in the early years}} of parenting when <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>demands</b> for young children is high. Methods In order to examine these associations, while adjusting for a wide range of known covariates of parenting and relationship quality, regression models using survey data from 2151 working mothers of 4 - to 5 -year-old children are reported. Results/Conclusion Results provided partial support for the predicted independent relationships between work–family conflict, enrichment and indicators of the quality of parenting and the couple relationship...|$|R
40|$|Early onset {{dementia}} {{is defined}} as affecting someone who is {{under the age of}} 65. As this usually affects someone when they still have family and employment responsibilities this group of people have a lot of needs to be met. This condition not only impacts on someone’s mental health, well-being and meaningful occupations but also has a huge impact on their family members as they try to cope with <b>the</b> <b>caring</b> <b>demands</b> which ensue. This thesis explores young person’s experiences of having a parent with early onset dementia in Scotland. A generic qualitative design shall be used to understand the perspectives and experiences of six young people in this situation.

40|$|Objectives: {{describe}} <b>care</b> {{needs and}} <b>demands</b> {{that mark the}} discursive practices of ostomized clients and family members and discuss guidelines for a comprehensive care program to ostomized clients and their families, organized by macrosociological categories. Method: Creative and Sensitive, involving 17 ostomized subjects and family members at a municipal outpatient clinic. The ethical aspects were complied with. A characterization form was used, as well as Creativity and Sensitivity Dynamics: "speaking map", "body-knowledge" and "calendar". Critical Discourse Analysis was applied. Results: the health needs and <b>care</b> <b>demands</b> of <b>the</b> ostomized patients and their family members, in their multiple dimensions, were constituted {{in the home and}} community, outpatient and social context, implying new orientations for nursing <b>care.</b> <b>The</b> unveiling of the data brought elements that constituted guidelines, in a macrosociological approach, to achieve the expanded integrality of nursing <b>care.</b> Conclusion: <b>the</b> ostomized clients are unique in their genre/peculiar from Latin sui generis, calling for strategies that respond to and distinguish their specificities. Elaborating a Public Health Policy that improves and reorganizes <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>demands,</b> taking into account these individual biopsychosocial and spiritual aspects, is a possible and irrevocable target in the attempt to achieve better conditions of health and wellbeing...|$|R

40|$|Discussion between {{informal}} and formal caregivers of community-dwelling older adults: Current Dutch policy on long-term care {{is aimed at}} a stronger connection between formal home care and informal care. We examined if formal and informal caregivers of community-dwelling older adults discuss <b>the</b> <b>care</b> and whether this is related to characteristics of the older adult, <b>the</b> <b>care</b> network and <b>the</b> individual caregivers. Data are derived from 63 community-dwelling older adults, including their health, their perceived control of <b>the</b> <b>care</b> and their care network. In addition, 79 {{informal and}} 90 formal caregivers are interviewed on their motives and vision on caregiving. The 112 dyads between those formal and informal caregivers are the units of analysis in the current study. Bivariate analyses reveal that informal caregivers {{are more likely to}} discuss <b>the</b> <b>care</b> with formal caregivers when they are residing with the older adult, when they provide a lot of care and/or when they are strongly motivated to keep the older adult at home. This is particularly the case when <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>demands</b> are high. Characteristics of the formal caregivers were not important. In conclusion, discussion of care between non-resident informal caregivers and formal caregivers is not self-evident and requires more effort to be established. © 2014 Bohn, Stafleu van Loghum...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is about an}} exploratory, descriptive and in a qualitative approach study, which hadas its objective {{to know how the}} choice of the sick elderly peoples familial caretaker occurs and how the caretakerfeels in this role. The main caretaker was interviewed in home visits. The sample was constituted of nine familialcaretakers, mainly from the female sex: wives, daughters, daughters-in-law, granddaughters, and the husband. Forthe analysis of the data, the content analysis, following the methodological steps of Minayo, was used. Twoanalytical categories were elaborated: being a familial caretaker: is it an option or an obligation?, which shows thatthe choice of taking care is closely related to the feeling of obligation, but also to affection relations, gratitude andthe impossibility of choosing another caretaker, and being a sick elderly peoples familial caretaker that approachesfeelings of gratitude, resignation, inexperience in face of <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>demands,</b> physical and emotional tiredness, lossof freedom and solitude due to the activity in the caretaker...|$|R

40|$|Twenty-one {{district}} nurses (DNs) narrated 44 {{cases of}} elder abuse within families. A phenomenological-hermeneutical {{analysis revealed that}} the experiences were complex and often included families providing care for an elderly person. The abuse seemed {{to be related to}} the inability of one party to meet <b>the</b> <b>care</b> <b>demands</b> required <b>by</b> <b>the</b> elderly, <b>by</b> him- or herself, or <b>by</b> <b>the</b> situation. It also seemed to be related to an inhibiting dependency between the parties, a negative execution of power over the weaker party, and a history of violence. When the experiences were considered within the perspective of Lögstrup's ethics, it appeared that the DNs tried to remain neutral by not consciously reflecting on the ethical demands in the abuse situations. The findings suggest that nurses need support to enable them to decide about provision of care at home and to judge "the core" in abuse situations. They might gain this support through reflection on a meta-level, taking various perspectives into account, and thus making it possible to achieve new dimensions for decision making...|$|R
