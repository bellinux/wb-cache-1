50|$|RDF {{consists}} {{largely of}} combustible components of such wastes, as non recycable plastics (not including PVC), paper cardboard, labels, and other corrugative materials. These fractions {{are separated by}} different processing steps, such as screening, air classifiation, <b>ballistic</b> <b>separation,</b> separation of ferrous and non ferrous materials, glass, stones and other foreign materials and shredding into a uniform grain size, {{in order to produce}} a homogenous material which can be used as substitute for fossil fuels in e.g. cement plants, lime plants, coal fired power plants or as reduction Agent in Steel Furnaces. RDF can be also further specified into e.g. tyre derived fuels (TDF) from used tyres, or solid recovered fuels (SRF).|$|E
40|$|Chaotic flows drive {{mixing and}} {{efficient}} transport in fluids, {{as well as}} the associated beautiful complex patterns familiar to us from our every day life experience. Generating such flows at small scales where viscosity takes over is highly challenging from both the theoretical and engineering perspectives. This can be overcome by introducing a minuscule amount of long flexible polymers, resulting in a chaotic flow dubbed elastic turbulence. At the basis of the theoretical frameworks for its study lie the assumptions of a spatially smooth and random-in-time velocity field. Previous measurements of elastic turbulence have been limited to two-dimensions. Using a novel three-dimensional particle tracking method, we conduct a microfluidic experiment, allowing us to explore elastic turbulence from the perspective of particles moving with the flow. Our findings show that the smoothness assumption breaks already at scales smaller than a tenth of the system size. Moreover, we provide conclusive experimental evidence that <b>ballistic</b> <b>separation</b> prevails in the dynamics of pairs of tracers over long times and distances, exhibiting a memory of the initial separation velocities. The ballistic dispersion is universal, yet it has been overlooked so far in the context of small scales chaotic flows.

40|$|Adhesive {{forces are}} capable of {{deforming}} a soft elastic object when it comes in contact with a flat rigid substrate. The contact is in stable equilibrium if the total energy of the system arising from the elastic and surface forces exhibits a minimum at a zero or at a slightly negative load. However, as the system is continually unloaded, the energy barrier decreases and it eventually disappears, thus leading to a <b>ballistic</b> <b>separation</b> of the contact. While this type of contact splitting has received wide recognition, what has not been much appreciated with these types of soft adhesion problems is that rupture of a contact can also occur at any finite sub critical load {{in the presence of}} a noise. The soft contact problems are unique in that the noise can be a-thermal, whereas the metastable and stable states of the thermodynamic potential can arise from the competition of the elastic and the inter-facial energies of the system. Analysis based on activated rate theory and simulations based on stochastic dynamics show that the contact rupture dynamics is amenable to a force and noise induced escape of a particle from a potential well that is generic to various types of colloidal and macromolecular processes. These ideas are useful in understanding the results of a recent experiment involving the noise activated rolling dynamics of a rigid sphere on a surface, where it is pinned by soft micro-fibrils...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenology}} of turbulent relative dispersion is revisited. A heuristic {{scenario is}} proposed, in which pairs of tracers undergo {{a succession of}} independent <b>ballistic</b> <b>separations</b> during time intervals whose lengths fluctuate. This approach suggests that the logarithm of the distance between tracers self-averages and performs a continuous-time random walk. This leads to specific predictions for the probability distribution of separations, that differ from those obtained using scale-dependent eddy-diffusivity models (e. g. {{in the framework of}} Richardson's approach). Such predictions are tested against high-resolution simulations and shed new lights on the explosive separation between tracers. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
50|$|On March 4, 2016 the Falcon 9 flight 22 {{launched}} the 5,271 kg heavy SES-9 communications satellite,the rocket's largest payload yet targeting a highly-energetic geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). Consequently, the Falcon 9 first stage followed a <b>ballistic</b> trajectory after <b>separation</b> and re-entered {{the atmosphere at}} high velocity with very little fuel to mitigate potential aerodynamic damage.|$|R
50|$|Flight 22 was {{carrying}} a heavy payload of 5271 kg to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). This was heavier than previously advertised maximum lift capacity to GTO being made possible by going slightly subsynchronous. Following delays caused by failure of Flight 19 SpaceX agreed to provide extra thrust to the SES-9 satellite to take it supersynchronous.As {{a result of these}} factors, there was little propellant left to execute a full reentry and landing test with normal margins. Consequently the Falcon 9 first stage followed a <b>ballistic</b> trajectory after <b>separation</b> and re-entered the atmosphere at high velocity, making it less likely to land successfully. The atmospheric re-entry and controlled descent were successful despite the higher aerodynamical constraints on the first stage due to extra speed. However the rocket was moving too fast and was destroyed when it collided with the drone ship. SpaceX collected valuable data on the extended flight envelope required to recover boosters from GTO missions.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{dynamics}} of solute dispersion and mixing in unsaturated flows is analyzed from photobleaching experiments in two-dimensional porous micromodels. This technique allows producing pulse line (delta-Dirac) injections {{of a conservative}} tracer by bleaching a finite volume of fluorescent without disturbing the flow field. The temporal evolution of the concentration field and the spatial distribution {{of the air and}} water phases can be monitored at pore scale. We study the dispersion and mixing of a line of tracer under different water saturations. While dispersion in saturated porous media follows an approximately Fickian scaling, a shift to ballistic scaling is observed as soon as saturation is lowered. Hence, at the time scale of observation, dispersion in our unsaturated flows is dominated by the <b>ballistic</b> <b>separation</b> of tracer blobs within the water phase, between trapped clusters and preferential flow paths. While diffusion plays a minor role in the longitudinal dispersion during the time scale of the experiments, its interplay with fluid deformation is apparent in the {{dynamics of}} mixing. The scalar dissipation rates show an initial stretching regime, during which mixing is enhanced by fluid deformation, followed by a dissipation regime, during which diffusion overcomes compression induced by stretching. The transition between these two regimes occurs at the mixing time, when concentration gradients are maximum. We propose a predictive analytical model, based on shear-enhanced diffusion, that captures the dynamics of mixing from basic unsaturated porous media parameters, suggesting that this type of model may be a useful framework at larger scales...|$|E
40|$|The <b>ballistic</b> <b>separation</b> {{effect in}} an {{aircraft}} flowfield was predicted via the direct calculation of incremental coefficients. A highly robust flow solver, including a Chimera grid module, {{was used to}} create the trajectory of a released store and to calculate incremental coefficients. The incremental coefficients were computed according {{to the difference between}} the aerodynamic coefficients in the aircraft flowfield and in the freestream condition. Two different calculations can be executed simultaneously in a parallel computing environment. The aircraft flowfield effect was measured using the incremental coefficients. This method of direct calculation of the incremental coefficients was tested in the case of released stores in two-dimensional subsonic and supersonic flow regions. The accuracy of the unsteady trajectory calculation was verified through comparisons with the captive trajectory system data in the Eglin wing/pylon/store separation problem. The method was then applied to a generic bomb released from a full-body aircraft. The computational results show that the current method is capable of simulating the store trajectory and investigating aircraft flowfield effects.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{dynamics}} of the granular Rayleigh-Taylor is studied in a rectangular Hele-Shaw cell. The affect of the interstitial fluid properties on the mixing of the grains is studied in experiments and well matched simulations. The numerical model was modified to account for fluid compressibility fluid inertia and viscous forces which lead to a hydrodynamic particle-particle coupling and a coupling between the fluid flow and the confining plates. In addition the model also includes solid friction between the particles and the plates. To verify the numerical model and its simplifications it was compared to well matched experiments. This test showed excellent agreement between the numerical model and the experiments. In regard of the mixing the compressibility of the interstitial fluid affects the dynamical patterns and the particle mixing much less than the viscosity. Depending on the viscosity the initial dynamics could be classified into two regimes. For low viscosities a <b>ballistic</b> particle pair <b>separation</b> was measured and for high fluid viscosity turbulent-dispersive particle pair separation was observed. In a further work it will be of interest to study the dependency on system parameters of this transition from the ballistic to the turbulent-dispersive behavior...|$|R
