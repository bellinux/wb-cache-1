40|$|Abstract—The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} carefully designed and collected speech corpora opens up new {{possibilities for the}} statistical estimation of formal multivariate prosodic models. At Apple Computer, statistical prosodic modeling exploits the Vic-toria corpus, recently created to broadly support ongoing speech synthesis research and development. This corpus is composed of five constituent parts, each designed to cover a specific aspect of speech synthesis: polyphones, prosodic contexts, reiterant speech, function word sequences, and continuous speech. This paper focuses {{on the use of}} the Victoria corpus in the statistical estima-tion of duration and pitch models for Apple’s next-generation text-to-speech system in Macintosh OS X. Duration modeling relies primarily on <b>the</b> <b>subcorpus</b> of prosodic contexts, which is instrumental to uncover empirical evidence in favor of a piece-wise linear transformation in the well-known sums-of-products approach.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study investigating the hypothesis that the recurrent features, or universals, of translated language are primarily the result of a mediation process that is shared among different kinds of mediated language, rather than the particularities of bilingual language processing. The investigation made use of a comparable corpus consisting of a subcorpus of English texts translated from Afrikaans, a subcorpus of comparable edited English texts, and a subcorpus of comparable unedited (and also untranslated) English texts. The frequency and distribution of linguistic features associated with three of the universals of translated language (explicitation, normalisation/conservatism, and simplification) across <b>the</b> three <b>subcorpora</b> were analysed. <b>The</b> study was guided by the hypothesis that the frequency and distribution of linguistic features associated with the universals of translated language would demonstrate similarities in <b>the</b> two <b>subcorpora</b> of mediated text (i. e., the translated and edited subcorpus), as compared to <b>the</b> <b>subcorpus</b> of unmediated text (i. e., <b>the</b> unedited <b>subcorpus).</b> However, <b>the</b> study yields almost no evidence for a mediation effect that is shared by translated and edited language, at least not along the linguistic features investigated.

This offers some support for the hypothesis of universals of translated language that are unique to this kind of text mediation specifically. Furthermore, the findings of the study suggest that editing may involve a different kind of mediation effect altogether, which frequently remains invisible in conventional corpus-based studies comparing translated and non-translated language, and which requires further investigation.

40|$|The Louvain International Database of Spoken English Interlanguage (LINDSEI) {{contains}} informal {{interviews with}} intermediate to advanced level learners of English {{as a foreign}} language. The interviews follow the same set pattern and {{are made up of}} three main tasks: a personal narrative based on a set topic (an experience that taught them a lesson, a country that impressed them, or a film or play they liked/disliked), a free discussion mainly about university life, hobbies, foreign travel or plans for the future and a picture description. Although the interviews are all conducted in English, 'foreign' words sometimes feature in <b>both</b> <b>the</b> interviewers' and the learner interviewees' contributions. This poster sets out to examine and compare the use of foreign words in five of <b>the</b> <b>subcorpora</b> included on <b>the</b> LINDSEI CD-ROM (Gilquin et al. 2010) : interviews with Dutch-, French-, German-, Italian- and Spanish-speaking EFL learners (LINDSEI_Dutch, LINDSEI_French, LINDSEI_German, LINDSEI_Italian, LINDSEI_Spanish). These subcorpora contain between 140, 000 and 80, 000 words of interviewee and interviewer speech. Foreign words have been specially marked up in the LINDSEI corpus (WORD(S) </foreign). They were retrieved from <b>the</b> <b>subcorpora</b> using WordSmith Tools and carefully examined in context. The study investigates the extent to which foreign words are used in the five learner varieties, whether or not the majority of the learner interviewees in each subcorpus under study resort to these items, the origin of the foreign words used (do the foreign words systematically come from the learners' mother tongue or do they sometimes come from another (foreign/second) language?) and the type of gaps the foreign words help learners bridge across the three interview tasks. The analysis reveals that, besides helping learners bridge vocabulary/lexical gaps (words/expressions that appear to be unknown or inaccessible to them; e. g. 'cotizar', 'des algues', 'lasser'), the foreign words in LINDSEI very often serve as cultural/institutional bridges (e. g. 'Tour de France', 'Parco Nazionale del Gran Paradiso', 'Vlaamse Opera', 'Abitur', 'gilles de Binche') and pragmatic/discourse bridges (e. g. 'ja', 'allez', 'si', 'enfin', 'bueno'). Although the main focus of the study is on the foreign words used by the EFL learners, the analysis also explores the use of these words by the interviewers (most of whom are native speakers of English in <b>the</b> <b>subcorpora</b> under study) in the interactions: whether or not the interviewers initiate the use of some foreign words, how they react to the foreign words used by the learners, whether or not they repeat learners' foreign words {{and whether or not they}} provide the learners with any (lexical) help.

The speeches and interpretations were taken from the 'EPIC Ghent' corpus, which is in preparation at Ghent University. Three phenomena were identified as potential effects of a short EVS: syntactic transcodage (maintaining the right-branching French 'noun+de+noun' structure, not using a more natural left-branching structure, in the Dutch interpretation), use of cognates similar in sound to source language forms ('glissement phonetique'), and certain self-repairs (Barik 1973; Gile 1995). Time tags were applied to <b>both</b> <b>the</b> source and target texts, so that EVS could be measured to the nearest second from the onset of a source language item to the onset of the target language equivalent.

Central to this issue is the notion of disciplinary values, that is, qualities which define what is prized or stigmatised by different professional communities. In the present paper, the notion of disciplinary values is used to examine the way legal writers communicate meaning in different genres. To this end, six adjective/adverb sets which have a prominent place in legal discourse (“clear/ly”, “important/ly”, “reasonable/ly”, “appropriate/ly”, “correct/ly ” and “proper/ly”) are identified. Their collocates and semantic preferences are studied in four 500, 000 -word corpora consisting of texts from the area of commercial law: academic journal articles, case law, legislation, and legal documents. Although the frequency and use of “clear/ly ” and “important/ly ” appear not to differ greatly from those found in other corpora of written and academic written texts such as the British National Corpus (BNC) and the British Academic Written English corpus (BAWE), “reasonable/ly”, “appropriate/ly”, “correct/ly ” and “proper/ly ” were found to be salient in some or all of <b>the</b> <b>subcorpora.</b> <b>The</b> reasons for this are then analysed within the framework of disciplinary values.

The problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum is considered as being well-suited to creating this kind of knowledge. The facilitator {{plays a crucial role}} in establishing and maintaining the knowledge construction discourse as students interact to resolve case problems. An exploration of tutorial talk could provide opportunities to understand and improve verbal interactions of this nature. Many of the previous studies have only analysed a small amount of tutorial talks owing to methodological constraints, and the existing literature on the subject matter only scarcely touches upon the utility of lexicogrammatical methods for the development of an understanding of knowledge construction in medical PBL tutorials. In this research, a blend of corpus linguistics methodology and a lexicogrammatical approach was employed for the analysis of talk in 8 PBL tutorial groups in order to deepen our understanding of how students jointly construct knowledge and how the facilitator guides the process. Aims In this study, a corpus of 2, 37, 820 comprising eight PBL students’ and facilitators’ tutorial talk was created to achieve the following aims: I.

The principal research questions relate to whether the perceived difference between the US and UK reporting is evident in the BBC and CBS partitions of <b>the</b> TVNews <b>subcorpus.</b> <b>The</b> degree to which reporters were ‘with us or with them’ is explored, that is, whether the purported difference between the two news services can be linked to a representation of the ‘sides’- a simplistic dichotomy often found in traditional war rhetoric...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} the present thesis is a {{contrastive}} analysis of two formally similar adverbs, the English actually and the French actuellement, which despite their com- mon etymological origins nowadays render different meaning. The theoretical chapter deals with classification of the two adverbs; in particular their semantic roles and syntactic functions. The latter section of this chapter {{is concerned with the}} historical development of the semantic meaning and concentrates on the common etymological origins {{as well as on the}} possible interchangeability of the adverbs. The research part focuses on the detailed analysis of the two adverbs based on the examples excerpted from the synchronic monolingual corpora (British National Corpus for English and Lextutor-Parlé for French) and describes their semantic roles as well as syntactic functions. The second part of this chapter is an analysis of the translation equivalents of actually and actuellement. The material for this section was excerpted from the parallel corpus InterCorp (fiction Core and <b>the</b> <b>subcorpus</b> Europarl). This thesis aims to identify possible discourse functions developed in the French actuellement and explore the translation correspondences of the two adverbs. Key words: actually, actuellement, discourse functions, faux-ami...|$|R

Objective of this year is the analysis of the adapt-ability of the detection approaches when given different genres. For this purpose a corpus with four different parts (subcorpora) has been compiled: social me-dia, Twitter, blogs, and hotel reviews. The construction of <b>the</b> Twitter <b>subcorpus</b> happened in cooperation with RepLab in order to investigate also a reputational perspective. Altogether, the approaches of 10 participants are evaluated. ...|$|R
40|$|With this study, {{we aim to}} {{continue}} {{the study of the}} reformulative markers in European contemporary Portuguese (Lopes 2014). Two new discourse markers, por outras palavras and digamos, are syntactically, semantically and pragmatically described in this paper. The empirical data were colected from CETEMPúblico and <b>the</b> oral <b>subcorpus</b> of CRPC. Even though both discourse markers can be included in the paradigm of the reformulative ones, the study proves that digamos is not a prototypical member, given its productivity as a filler and a mitigation operator...|$|R
