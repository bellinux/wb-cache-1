25|$|Depending on {{the design}} of the weapon and the {{environment}} in which it is detonated the energy distributed to these categories can be increased or decreased. The <b>blast</b> <b>effect</b> is created by the coupling of immense amounts of energy, spanning the electromagnetic spectrum, with the surroundings. Locations such as submarine, ground burst, air burst, or exo-atmospheric determine how much energy is produced as blast and how much as radiation. In general, denser media around the bomb, like water, absorb more energy, and create more powerful shockwaves {{while at the same time}} limiting the area of its effect.|$|E

50|$|Assuming a {{detonation}} at optimum height, a 9 megaton blast {{would result}} in a fireball with an approximate 2.9 to 3.4 mi diameter. The radiated heat would be sufficient to cause lethal burns to any unprotected person within a 20 mi radius (1250 sq mi). <b>Blast</b> <b>effects</b> would be sufficient to collapse most residential and industrial structures within a 9 mi radius (254 sq mi); within 3.65 mi (42 sq mi) virtually all above-ground structures would be destroyed and <b>blast</b> <b>effects</b> would inflict near 100% fatalities. Within 2.25 mi a 500 rem dose of ionizing radiation would be received by the average person, sufficient to cause a 50% to 90% casualty rate independent of thermal or <b>blast</b> <b>effects</b> at this distance.|$|R
25|$|The Panzerfaust 3 {{is light}} enough to be carried and fired by one person. It can be fired from {{enclosures}} since {{it does not have}} a significant backblast; the rear of the tube, filled with plastic granulate, minimises the <b>blast</b> <b>effect</b> by the so-called recoilless countermass principle. The booster propellant for the projectile in its tube is ignited by a bolt via a spring mechanism. Once ejected from the launcher, the projectile coasts a safe distance and then the rocket motor is ignited, boosting it to its maximum speed, after which it coasts until impact. The gunner carries at least two rounds while the assistant grenadier carries an additional three rounds.|$|E
25|$|Gemini's {{emergency}} launch escape {{system did}} not use an escape tower powered by a solid-fuel rocket, but instead used aircraft-style ejection seats. The tower was heavy and complicated, and NASA engineers reasoned {{that they could do}} away with it as the Titan II's hypergolic propellants would burn immediately on contact. A Titan II booster explosion had a smaller <b>blast</b> <b>effect</b> and flame than on the cryogenically fueled Atlas and Saturn. Ejection seats were sufficient to separate the astronauts from a malfunctioning launch vehicle. At higher altitudes, where the ejection seats could not be used, the astronauts would return inside the spacecraft, which would separate from the launch vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the weapons}} were {{obsolete}} {{at the time}} of purchase, security forces found them to be successful in combat. Land mines proved to be the most lethal threat to personnel, as a number of mines were deployed against unprotected trucks and buses by the LTTE in the northern and eastern Provinces. These land mines weighed approximately 50 – 100kg, against which no armoured vehicle that the SLA possessed was able to withstand the <b>blast</b> <b>effect.</b> Consequently, Armscor Buffels - South African armoured personnel carriers constructed on a Unimog chassis - were imported in quantity. By 1987 Sri Lanka's indigenous Unicorn APC had been engineered from the Buffel, followed by the improved Unibuffel class. Both the Unicorn and the Unibuffel are assembled by the Sri Lanka Electrical & Mechanical Engineers.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} a new method {{to calculate the}} <b>blast</b> <b>effects</b> originating from an exploding vessel of liquefied gas. Adequate blast calculation requires full knowledge of the blast source characteristics, that is, the release and subsequent evaporation rate of the flashing liquid. Because the conditions that allow explosive evaporation are not entirely clear and the evaporation rate of a flashing liquid is unknown, safe assumptions have been adopted {{as the starting point}} in the modeling. The <b>blast</b> <b>effects</b> from a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) are numerically computed by imposing the vapor pressure of a flashing liquid as boundary condition for the gas dynamics of expansion. The numerical modeling is quantitatively explored just for liquefied propane. In addition, this paper demonstrates that often an estimate of BLEVE <b>blast</b> <b>effects</b> is possible with very simple acoustic volume source expressions. The modeling shows that the rupture of a pressure vessel containing a liquefied gas in free space develops a blast of significant strength only if the vessel nearly instantaneously disintegrates. Even if a rupture and the consequent release and evaporation of a liquefied gas extend over just a short period of time, the <b>blast</b> <b>effects</b> are minor. © 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers...|$|R

500|$|Macrae {{credits the}} Australian army with {{developing}} {{the technique of}} slapping a sticky bomb directly onto a tank instead of throwing it from a relatively safe distance. Since the bomb used a <b>blast</b> <b>effect,</b> {{it was safe to}} do this and walk away provided only that the bomb's handle was pointing away from the bomber – the handle would be shot away from the explosion [...] "like a bullet." [...] Macrae gives no date for the development of this tactic. Macrae confirmed that placing the bomb rather than throwing it gives better adhesion and allows thicker plates to be penetrated.|$|E
2500|$|Each [...] "Sailor Hat" [...] test at Kahoolawe {{consisted}} of a dome-stacked [...] charge of TNT high explosive detonated on the shore close to the ships under test.

The main ship used for testing was the former Cleveland-class light cruiser [...] In addition, the guided-missile destroyer leaders [...] and , the guided-missile destroyers , , and , and the Royal Canadian Navy's escort destroyer [...] all participated in the trial.

2500|$|Rocket {{development}} {{had begun}} during the 1920s and reached fruition {{in the late}} thirties. This offered the opportunity for the Nebeltruppen to deliver large quantities of poison gas or smoke simultaneously. The first weapon to be delivered to the troops was the 15cm Nebelwerfer 41 in 1940, after the Battle of France, a purpose-designed rocket with gas, smoke and high-explosive warheads. It, like virtually all German rocket designs, was spin-stabilized to increase accuracy. One very unusual feature was that the rocket motor was in the front, the exhaust venturi being about two-thirds down the body from the nose, {{with the intent to}} optimize the <b>blast</b> <b>effect</b> of the rocket as the warhead would still be above the ground when it detonated. This proved to greatly complicate manufacture for not much extra effect and it was not copied on later rocket designs. It was fired from a six-tube launcher mounted on a towed carriage adapted from that used by the 3.7 cm PaK 36 and had a range of [...] Almost five and a half million 15cm rockets and 6,000 launchers were manufactured {{over the course of the}} war.|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{building}} structures are mainly analyzed {{through the application}} of simplified methods of structural dynamics. Towards this end, analysis of an equivalent static load which causes the same effects in respect of structural elements as the dynamic load, is performed. However <b>blast</b> <b>effects</b> represent galloping and extremely nonlinear processes. In this regard, analysis of a blast load is to be performed {{through the application of}} methods of nonlinear dynamics to take account of physical, geometrical and structural nonlinearities. The problem is to be solved by motion equations in the pre-set time domain. The authors propose deterministic methods of analysis of parameters of <b>blast</b> <b>effects</b> and results of simulations generated through the employment of LS-DYNA software. Gas dynamics equations employed to solve the aforementioned problems are provided in the most convenient Eulerian formulation.

2500|$|Armour at {{the flight}} deck level would protect the hangar deck and the {{aircraft}} stored there from most bombs. The armour of the Illustrious class was intended to protect against 1,000 pound bombs. In the Illustrious class, the armoured flight deck extended for {{about two-thirds of the}} length of the ship, bounded by the two aircraft lifts (which were without the armour). The deck was closed by [...] armoured sides and bulkheads, forming an armoured box. The bulkheads had sliding armoured portals to allow access between the hangar and the aircraft lift. There were [...] lateral strakes of main deck armour that extended {{from the base of the}} hangar side-wall to the top of the main side belt. The latter protected the machinery, magazines and aircraft fuel and weaponry stores. The RN's closed and armoured hangars were capable of being environmentally sealed for protection against chemical weapon attack. The armoured design meant that it would have to be attacked with Armour Piercing (AP) bombs, which have much less <b>blast</b> <b>effect</b> than higher-capacity General Purpose (GP) bombs carrying about twice the explosive amount. GP bombs also caused severe hull damage if they exploded in the water close to the hull; AP bombs, much less so.|$|E
2500|$|Combles, Morval, Lesbœufs and Gueudecourt were {{captured}} and many casualties inflicted on the Germans. The French made slower progress near the inter-army boundary, {{due to the}} obstruction of St Pierre Vaast Wood to the French attack north towards Sailly and Sailly-Saillisel. The inter-army boundary was moved north from [...] to allow the French more room to deploy their forces but the great quantity of German artillery-fire limited the French advance. The Fourth Army advance on 25 September was its deepest since 14 July and left the Germans in severe difficulties, particularly in a salient which developed to the north-east of Combles. Tiredness and lack of reserves prevented the Fourth Army exploiting its success beyond patrolling and cavalry probes. The Reserve Army attack began on 26 September, at the Battle of Thiepval Ridge. Deteriorating weather and the shorter days, greatly increased British and French transport difficulties; rain and fog grounded aircraft and impeded artillery observation. Mud reduced the <b>blast</b> <b>effect</b> of shells and immobilised infantry, which was an advantage to the defenders. A small number of tanks joined in the battle later in the afternoon, after having been held back because of the later start and reduced a number of German strong points which had withstood earlier attacks.|$|E
