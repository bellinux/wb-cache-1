5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the <b>Blades</b> <b>of</b> Exile, {{replacing}} the <b>Blades</b> <b>of</b> Athena used in previous installments {{and the opening}} moments of this game. The weapon {{is a pair of}} blades that are attached to chains wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms, which can be swung in a number of maneuvers. During the game, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Claws of Hades, the Nemean Cestus, and the Nemesis Whip—with other combat options. The Nemean Cestus, a pair of gauntlets, and the Nemesis Whip, which is similar to the <b>Blades</b> <b>of</b> Exile, are required to advance in parts of the game; for example, the Nemean Cestus is needed to break through objects composed of onyx.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of God of War, Kratos had been serving the gods for ten years and had grown tired of his service and nightmares. When he confronted his patron Athena, she advised {{him that if he}} killed the rampaging Ares, the gods would forgive his sins. With this selfish motive, he again agreed, and after finding and using Pandora's Box, he was successful. Despite being freed of Ares' influence, {{including}} the <b>Blades</b> <b>of</b> Chaos, Kratos was forgiven but was not relieved of his nightmares. A dissatisfied and despairing Kratos tried to commit suicide but was saved by Athena, who guided him to Olympus. Awarded the <b>Blades</b> <b>of</b> Athena, Kratos became the new God of War.|$|E

5|$|Deathrow {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2219, where Blitz is the world's most popular sport. Players attempt to toss a disc through a hoop while {{avoiding}} full-contact from their opponents, including punches, kicks, throws, and stomps. Like a futuristic rugby, the sport combines elements of hockey, basketball, and full-contact American football. Critics compared the game's mechanics to Discs of Tron, Mortal Kombat, Blood Bowl, Final Fantasy Xs Blitzball, <b>Blades</b> <b>of</b> Steel, and Speedball, and its aesthetic to that of Blade Runner. The game's premise was also compared to the 1975 film Rollerball.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{falls into}} the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus; {{the souls of the}} Underworld weaken him and ruin the <b>Blades</b> <b>of</b> Athena. Climbing from the river, he is confronted by the spirit of Athena, who had {{previously}} sacrificed herself to save Zeus from Kratos. She tells Kratos that her sacrifice has brought her to a higher existence, and she now sees truths she did not see before. She states that as long as Zeus reigns, there is no hope for mankind. She gives him the <b>Blades</b> <b>of</b> Exile and says that to kill Zeus, he must quench the Flame of Olympus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos encounters the spirit of Pandora, whom he mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Refusing to help the child, he continues his quest. After encountering the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering the Blade of Olympus, he kills Hades, which releases the souls of the Underworld. When he considers searching for the soul of Calliope, Athena reminds Kratos of his quest, and he leaves the Underworld, arriving at Olympia. There he finds the wounded Gaia, who calls for help. He severs her arm, causing her to fall from Mount Olympus to her apparent death.|$|E
5|$|Kratos is {{a warrior}} who serves the Greek gods of Olympus. Flashbacks reveal {{that he was}} once a {{successful}} captain in the Spartan army and led his men to several victories before being defeated by a barbarian king. Facing death, Kratos called on the God of War, Ares, whom he promised to serve if the god would spare his men and provide the power to destroy their enemies. Ares agreed and bonded the <b>Blades</b> <b>of</b> Chaos, a pair of chained blades forged {{in the depths of}} Tartarus, to his new servant. Kratos, equipped with the blades, then decapitated the barbarian king.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to previous installments, focusing on combo-based combat with the player's main weapon—the <b>Blades</b> <b>of</b> Exile—and secondary weapons acquired during the game. It uses quick time events, where the player acts in a timed sequence to defeat strong enemies and bosses. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options, and the game features puzzles and platforming elements. Compared with previous installments, God of War III offers a revamped magic system, more onscreen enemies, new camera angles, and downloadable content.|$|E

5|$|Kratos recovers Pandora's Box from Ares, opens it, {{and uses}} {{its power to}} become godlike. Despite Ares' best efforts to destroy Kratos {{physically}} and mentally, including stripping him of the <b>Blades</b> <b>of</b> Chaos and all magic, he survives and kills Ares with the Blade of the Gods. Athens is saved, and although Athena tells Kratos his sins are forgiven, the gods refuse to rid him of his nightmares. Forsaken by the gods, he tries to commit suicide by casting himself into the Aegean Sea, but Athena intervenes and transports him to Mount Olympus. As a reward for his services to the gods, she provides Kratos with {{a new set of}} blades and the seat as the new God of War.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the <b>Blades</b> <b>of</b> Chaos, {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around his wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. A new weapons mechanic called the World Weapon system allows Kratos to pick up weapons scattered throughout game locations or to take them from defeated foes, and to use these for a limited time. There are five World Weapons (sword, club, javelin, sling, shield) that can be collected randomly, although Kratos may possess only one at any time. When a World Weapon is not equipped, Kratos may punch or kick foes {{as part of the}} new combat system. Another new mechanic is that Kratos can tether enemies, referred to as grappling; he can hold an enemy in place with one blade while he attacks other enemies with the other blade, and he can throw the tethered enemy.|$|E

Kratos only learns three magical abilities, as opposed to four in previous installments, including the Efreet, the Light of Dawn, and Charon's Wrath, giving him {{a variety of ways}} to attack and kill enemies. He acquires the relic Triton's Lance—similar to Poseidon's Trident in God of War— which allows him to breathe underwater; a necessary ability as parts of the game require long periods of time there.|$|E

5|$|On 26 February, {{an interim}} report {{published}} by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch outlined the current progress of the investigation. The report contained a single conclusion, that the immediate cause of the accident was {{the condition of the}} stretcher bar arrangement at points 2B at Lambrigg crossover, which resulted in the loss of gauge separation of the point switch blades. The stretcher bars (components that hold the moving <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> the points the correct distance apart) had been found to be disconnected or missing. Of the three bars, one was not in position, another had nuts and bolts missing, and two were fractured. The points in question were facing the direction of travel of the train.|$|E
5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a {{wind turbine}} are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E

Four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability {{can be used as}} alternative combat options, and the game features puzzles and platforming elements. Ascension is the only installment in the series to include online multiplayer features for both competitive and cooperative play. It also features a redesigned combat system, new gameplay mechanics, and downloadable content. From October 2012 to March 2013, a social experience was available online {{in the form of a}} graphic novel titled Rise of the Warrior, a prequel story that tied into the game's single-player and multiplayer modes.|$|E
