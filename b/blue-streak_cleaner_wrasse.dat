40|$|Reef sharks {{clean up}} with a novel inshore mutualistic {{interaction}} Parasite removal by cleaner fish provides significant health benefits {{to a variety of}} coral reef fish, particularly roving carnivores and herbivores (Grutter et al. 2003). For grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), however, such cleaning events are only known to occur sporadically, on exposed oceanic reefs (O’Shea et al. 2010). This is because hosts on cleaning stations must remain relatively stationary (Côte ́ et al. 1998), a behaviour which requires constant current flow for grey reef sharks. Within the central region of Ningaloo Reef (S 23. 1, E 113. 8), an 8 -m-deep lagoonal Turbinaria coral bommie provides the only reported example of grey reef sharks utilising a shallow-water inshore cleaner fish station (Fig. 1 a). Here, sharks of both sexes up to 1. 8 m total length are cleaned by <b>blue-streak</b> <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Labroides dimidiatus) and moon wrasse (Thal-assoma lunare).

40|$|The {{presence}} of bluestreak <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse,</b> Labroides dimidiatus, on coral reefs increases total abundance and biodiversity of reef fishes. The mechanism(s) that cause such shifts in population structure are unclear, {{but it is}} possible that young fish preferentially settle into microhabitats where <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse</b> are present. As a first step to investigate this possibility, we conducted aquarium experiments to examine whether settlement-stage and young juveniles of ambon damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, selected a microhabitat near a <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse</b> (adult or juvenile). Both settlement-stage (0 d post-settlement) and juvenile (~ 5  weeks post-settlement) fish spent a greater proportion of time in a microhabitat adjacent to L. dimidiatus than in one next to a control fish (a non-cleaner wrasse, Halichoeres melanurus) or one where no fish was present. This suggests that <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse</b> may serve as a positive cue during microhabitat selection. We also conducted focal observations of <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse</b> and counts of nearby damselfishes (1  m radius) to examine whether newly settled fish obtained direct benefits, in the form of cleaning services, from being near a <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse.</b> Although abundant, newly settled recruits...|$|R

40|$|Mutualisms {{affect the}} biodiversity, {{distribution}} and abundance of biological communities. However, ecological processes that drive mutualism-related shifts in population structure are often unclear {{and must be}} examined to elucidate how complex, multi-species mutualistic networks are formed and structured. In this study, we investigated how the presence of key marine mutualistic partners can drive the organisation of local communities on coral reefs. The <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse,</b> Labroides dimidiatus, removes ectoparasites and reduces stress hormones for multiple reef fish species, and their presence on coral reefs increases fish abundance and diversity. Such changes in population structure could be driven by increased recruitment of larval fish at settlement, or by post-settlement processes such as modified levels of migration or predation. We conducted a controlled field experiment to {{examine the effect of}} cleaners on recruitment processes of a common group of reef fishes, and showed that small patch reefs (61 - 285 m(2)) with <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse</b> had higher abundances of damselfish recruits than reefs from which <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse</b> had been removed over a 12 -year period.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{potential}} mimetic relationships between coral reef fishes have been described, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Similarities in colour between species have often been attributed to aggressive mimicry (where predators resemble models in order to deceive prey), however {{this has not been}} tested. The fang blenny, Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos is a specialized predator that feeds on tissues of other fishes. Some individuals appear to mimic the harmless <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse</b> Labroides dimidiatus in order to deceive fish visiting cleaning stations, thereby increasing access to food. In this study, the ecological relationship between the mimic and model was examined at Kimbe Bay (Papua New Guinea) and the hypothesis that colour similarities represent facultative aggressive mimicry was experimentally evaluated. Some juveniles exhibited a striking resemblance to the juvenile colouration of the <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse,</b> but only when in close proximity to the wrasse and only when similar in size. As predicted for mimics, P. rhinorhynchos co-occurred with L. dimidiatus, but was rare relative to the model. Among site comparisons showed that the abundance of mimetic type blennies was positively correlated with the abundance of juvenile cleaner wrasses. Approximately 50 % of all P. rhinorhynchos were found ≤ 1 m from the nearest L. dimidiatus, a distance significantly shorter than expected if they were not associated. A <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse</b> removal experiment was carried out to test whether the colour displayed by the blenny and its foraging success were contingent upon the presence of a model. In all cases, removal of the model prompted a rapid colour change to a general non-mimetic colouration in P. rhinorhynchos. Removal of L. dimidiatus also resulted in a ~ 20 % reduction in the average foraging success of the blenny compared to controls, supporting the hypothesis that the blenny is a facultative aggressive mimic of the <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The false cleanerfish {{has been}} {{observed}} to mimic the unusual “dance” of the bluestreak <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse</b> by spreading its caudal fin and oscillating its posterior end up and down. By doing so, the false cleanerfish elicits the same posing behavior in client fish, similarly to L. dimidiatus. Occasionally, however, rather than feeding on ectoparasites like the <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse,</b> the false cleanerfish will attack and attempt (and sometimes succeed) at tearing away portions of fin from the client fish. This typically occurs and is most successful with juvenile client fish, as adults have been evidenced to avoid or even indiscriminately attack cleanerfish, suggesting adult client fish remember being attacked. [...] Also, evidence indicates adult fish are able to distinguish between L. dimidiatus and A. taeniatus, and thus avoid it altogether.|$|R

40|$|Mimicry {{systems can}} be {{classified}} {{by the nature of}} fitness benefits obtained by the mimic, namely increased mating opportunities (reproductive), increased foraging potential (aggressive), or reduced predation risk (protective). However, there is increasing evidence that mimicry categories are not mutually exclusive and mimics can obtain benefits from more than 1 category. Here, I provide evidence that an aggressive mimic, the bluestriped fangblenny Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos, also benefits from reduced predation risk by resembling the juvenile <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse</b> Labroides dimidiatus, which are thought to be relatively immune from predation due to the mutualistic nature of cleanerclient interactions. Instead of removing ectoparasites from larger reef fish, bluestriped fangblennies approach and attack reef fish removing scales and dermal tissue. Fangblennies can switch between their mimic and nonmimic coloration within 510 min, depending on whether their model (the <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse)</b> is present or absent. I found that mimic fangblennies increased their risk-taking behavior toward potential predators compared with nonmimic fangblennies. Mimics {{were also more likely to}} attack other reef fish in the presence of predators compared with nonmimics. Animals should only increase risk-taking behavior when they perceive the threat of predation to be low. Therefore, this study provides important evidence that cleaner coloration provides protection from predation to both cleaner fish and their mimics, and the benefits of aggressive mimicry of <b>cleaner</b> <b>wrasse</b> have to be reevaluated in the light of these data...|$|R
