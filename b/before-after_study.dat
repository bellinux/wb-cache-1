40|$|BACKGROUND: Secondary {{prevention}} programs for patients experiencing an {{acute coronary syndrome}} {{have been shown to}} be effective in the outpatient setting. The efficacy of in-hospital prevention interventions administered soon after acute cardiac events is unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether in-hospital, patient-level interventions targeting multiple cardiovascular risk factors reduce all-cause mortality after an acute coronary syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a prespecified search strategy, we included controlled clinical trials and <b>before-after</b> <b>studies</b> of secondary prevention interventions with at least a patient-level component (ie, education, counseling, or patient-specific order sets) initiated in hospital with outcomes of mortality, readmission, or reinfarction rates in acute coronary syndrome patients. We classified the interventions as patient-level interventions with or without associated healthcare provider-level interventions and/or system-level interventions. Twenty-six studies met our inclusion criteria. The summary estimate of 14 studies revealed a relative risk of all-cause mortality of 0. 79 (95 % CI, 0. 69 to 0. 92; n= 37, 585) at 1 year. However, the apparent benefit depended on study design and level of intervention. The <b>before-after</b> <b>studies</b> suggested reduced mortality (relative risk [RR], 0. 77; 95 % CI, 0. 66 to 0. 90; n= 3680 deaths), whereas the RR was 0. 96 (95 % CI, 0. 64 to 1. 44; n= 99 deaths) among the controlled clinical trials. Only interventions including a provider- or system-level intervention suggested reduced mortality compared with patient-level-only interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for in-hospital, patient-level interventions for secondary prevention is promising but not definitive because only <b>before-after</b> <b>studies</b> suggest a significant reduction in mortality. Future research should formally test which components of interventions provide the greatest benefit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Quality {{assessment}} tools for primary studies of test accuracy are relatively well developed, although only one is validated (QUADAS), but very little {{work has been}} done to develop tools to quality-assess studies evaluating the impact of diagnostic testing on management of patients (diagnostic or therapeutic yield). The recent draft NICE Guide to the Methods of Technology Appraisal (2007) suggests QUADAS "as a useful starting point for appraising studies that evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a test" but does not mention how to quality assess diagnostic or therapeutic yield studies, in particular diagnostic <b>before-after</b> <b>studies.</b> In the context of undertaking a rapid systematic review of structural neuroimaging in psychosis for NICE, we describe the modifications that we made to QUADAS, our experience of this in practice and in relation to published theory on diagnostic or therapeutic yield studies. Methods The QUADAS tool was assessed for use in the review by two systematic reviewers with in-depth knowledge of the clinical area being reviewed and the types of studies being found in the searches that could answer the clinical question. Modifications were made following discussion as considered appropriate. Results Two QUADAS questions were removed altogether and. four additional questions were developed to capture additional quality issues not addressed by QUADAS. However, the developed checklist only partially helped to discern implications of the study designs on the results given. Conclusion The division between topic-specific and more generic quality items of relevance to diagnostic <b>before-after</b> <b>studies</b> is important. With more time, further work could have been done to create a better quality assessment tool, for example by incorporating some of the issues mentioned in previous work in this area. This paper is a discussion around quality assessment and is intended to offer insights into the types of issues that should be assessed. A quality assessment tool for diagnostic <b>before-after</b> <b>studies</b> that incorporates items from QUADAS and published theory needs to be further developed and validated. </p...|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} {{method has}} limitations, of course. Retrospective <b>before-after</b> <b>studies</b> are not randomised experiments and {{the validity of}} their results {{is based on the}} assumption that the treated and comparison sites are similar. <b>Before-after</b> <b>studies</b> based on multivariate generalised linear models make it possible to better control for the influence of differences between treated and comparison sites. But such methodologies would generally involve a thorough data collection and analysis on a large sample of sites, which seems hard to implement by practitioners in the routine situations we considered in this paper. The comparability of treated and comparison sites, however, can be checked by examining their accident history, when accident data are available for a long period before the treatment (see [23]). A Bayesian approach to this subject could be studied. Besides, other developments could contribute to extending the field of application of the proposed method: in this paper, we only dealt with the case of a single treated site (or a group of sites treated as a whole, with a focus on the overall effect of the programme of treatment), with a comparison site or group of sites. The case of multiple treated sites considered independently and with possibly different odds ratios remains to be dealt with. However, this would involve an increased complexity and more difficulties for practitioners.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Vertebroplasty is a {{promising}} but as yet unproven treatment for painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures. It involves radiographic-guided injection {{of various types}} of bone cement directly into the vertebral fracture site. Uncontrolled studies and two controlled quasi-experimental <b>before-after</b> <b>studies</b> comparing volunteers who were offered treatment to those who refused it, have suggested an early benefit including rapid pain relief and improved function. Conversely, several uncontrolled studies {{and one of the}} controlled <b>before-after</b> <b>studies</b> have also suggested that vertebroplasty may increase the risk of subsequent vertebral fractures, particularly in vertebrae adjacent to treated levels or if cement leakage into the adjacent disc has occurred. As yet, there are no completed randomised controlled trials of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The aims of this participant and outcome assessor-blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial are to i) determine the short-term efficacy and safety (3 months) of vertebroplasty for alleviating pain and improving function for painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures; and ii) determine its medium to longer-term efficacy and safety, particularly the risk of further fracture over 2 years. Design A double-blind randomised controlled trial of 200 participants with one or two recent painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures.

40|$|Background: In {{uncontrolled}} <b>before-after</b> <b>studies,</b> CONSORT {{was shown}} to improve the reporting of randomised trials. <b>Before-after</b> <b>studies</b> ignore underlying secular trends and may overestimate the impact of interventions. Our aim {{was to assess the}} impact of the 2007 STROBE statement publication on the quality of observational study reporting, using both uncontrolled before-after analyses and interrupted time series. Methods: For this quasi-experimental study, original articles reporting cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies published between 2004 and 2010 in the four dermatological journals having the highest 5 -year impact factors ($ 4) were selected. We compared the proportions of STROBE items (STROBE score) adequately reported in each article during three periods, two pre STROBE period (2004 – 2005 and 2006 – 2007) and one post STROBE period (2008 – 2010). Segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series was also performed. Results: Of the 456 included articles, 187 (41 %) reported cohort studies, 166 (36. 4 %) cross-sectional studies, and 103 (22. 6 %) case-control studies. The median STROBE score was 57 % (range, 18 %– 98 %). Before-after analysis evidenced significant STROBE score increases between the two pre-STROBE periods and between the earliest pre-STROBE period and the post-STROBE period (median score 2004 – 05 48 % versus median score 2008 – 10 58 %, p, 0. 001) but not between the immediate pre-STROBE period and the post-STROBE period (median score 2006 – 07 58 % versus median score 2008 – 10 58 %, p = 0. 42).

40|$|The <b>before-after</b> <b>study</b> {{is still}} the most popular method used by traffic {{engineers}} and transportation safety analysts for evaluating the effects of an intervention. Compared to the cross-sectional study, the <b>before-after</b> <b>study</b> has lower within-subject variability since it directly accounts for changes that have occurred at the study sites.

DESIGN: Systematic review of <b>before-after</b> <b>studies</b> or randomized controlled trials on the effect of exercise and drug therapy in urinary incontinence. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURED: Reduction of urinary accidents, patient's perception, cystometric measurement, perineometry, and side effects. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE (1966 - 2001), EMBASE (1986 - 2001), Science Citation Index (1988 - 2001), The Cochrane Library, and PiCarta were searched. RESULTS Four <b>before-after</b> <b>studies</b> and 4 randomized controlled trials were identified. Drug therapy alone: no study of sufficient quality. Drug therapy compared with behavioral therapy, 3 studies: bladder-sphincter biofeedback reduced urinary accidents in cases of urge or mixed incontinence by 80. 7 %, significantly better than oxybutynin (68. 5 %) or placebo (39. 4 %). Adding drug to behavioral treatment or behavioral to drug treatment also resulted in significant reduction in urodynamic urge incontinence (57. 5 %- 88. 5 % vs 72. 7 - 84. 3 %). Pelvic floor exercises alone reduced urinary accidents by 48 % (compared with 53 % for phenylpropanolamine) in patients with mixed or stress incontinence.

The review {{focuses on the}} most recent literature on management of sleep bruxism (SB) in adults, as diagnosed with polysomnography (PSG) with audio-video (AV) recordings, or with any other approach measuring the sleep-time masticatory muscles' activity, viz., PSG without AV recordings or electromyography (EMG) recorded with portable devices. Fourteen (N = 14) papers {{were included in the}} review, of which 12 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 2 were uncontrolled <b>before-after</b> <b>studies.</b> Structured reading of the included articles showed a high variability of topics, designs and findings. On average, the risk of bias for RCTs was low-to-unclear, whilst the <b>before-after</b> <b>studies</b> had several methodological limitations. The studies’ results suggest that (i) almost every type of oral appliance (OA) (seven papers) is somehow effective to reduce SB activity, with a potentially higher decrease for devices providing large extent of mandibular advancement; (ii) all tested pharmacological approaches [i. e. botulinum toxin (two papers), clonazepam (one paper) and clonidine (one paper) ] may reduce SB with respect to placebo; (iii) the potential benefit of biofeedback (BF) and cognitive-behavioural (CB) approaches to SB management is not fully supported (two papers); and (iv) the only investigation providing an electrical stimulus to the masseter muscle supports its effectiveness to reduce SB.
