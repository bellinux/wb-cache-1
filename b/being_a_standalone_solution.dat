40|$|Summary: Genome-wide {{association}} studies use {{hundreds of}} thousands of markers making it challenging to present and finally interpret the results. We developed a graphical, web-based solution for an interactive exploration of the results of case-control studies, with a tight integration of related gene information and tissuespecific expression data. Association results are presented as physical position-based vertical bars with known genes included as horizontal bars at their respective physical positions. The interface allows the specification of filtering criteria for the association data and highlights potentially interesting genes with user-specified terms occurring in their reports or with relevant expression patterns. Popup windows and hyperlinks provide drill-down capabilities and quick access to relevant data AssociationDB can either be used as <b>a</b> <b>standalone</b> <b>solution</b> or as <b>a</b> front-end joining association results obtained by other software with genomic information...|$|R
40|$|Recently, many {{applications}} for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) {{have been developed}} for a large variety of learning problems. However, RBMs are usually used as feature extractors for another learning algorithm or to provide a good initialization for deep feed-forward neural network classifiers, and are not considered as <b>a</b> <b>standalone</b> <b>solution</b> to classification problems. In this paper, we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear classifiers. We present an evaluation of different learning algorithms for RBMs which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve their performance as classifiers. This approach is simple in that RBMs are used directly to build a classifier, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting...|$|R
40|$|Aggression among pigs {{adversely}} affects {{economic returns}} and animal welfare in intensive pigsties. In this study, {{we developed a}} non-invasive, inexpensive, automatic monitoring prototype system that uses a Kinect depth sensor to recognize aggressive behavior in a commercial pigpen. The method begins by extracting activity features from the Kinect depth information obtained in a pigsty. The detection and classification module, which employs two binary-classifier support vector machines in a hierarchical manner, detects aggressive activity, and classifies it into aggressive sub-types such as head-to-head (or body) knocking and chasing. Our experimental results showed that this method is effective for detecting aggressive pig behaviors {{in terms of both}} cost-effectiveness (using a low-cost Kinect depth sensor) and accuracy (detection and classification accuracies over 95. 7 % and 90. 2 %, respectively), either as <b>a</b> <b>standalone</b> <b>solution</b> or to complement existing methods...|$|R

40|$|Early {{detection}} of anomalies {{is an important}} issue in the management of group-housed livestock. In particular, failure to detect oestrus in a timely and accurate way can become a limiting factor in achieving efficient reproductive performance. Although a rich variety of methods has been introduced for the {{detection of}} oestrus, a more accurate and practical method is still required. In this paper, we propose an efficient data mining solution for the detection of oestrus, using the sound data of Korean native cows (Bos taurus coreanea). In this method, we extracted the mel frequency cepstrum coefficients from sound data with a feature dimension reduction, and use the support vector data description as an early anomaly detector. Our experimental results show that this method can be used to detect oestrus both economically (even a cheap microphone) and accurately (over 94 % accuracy), either as <b>a</b> <b>standalone</b> <b>solution</b> or to complement known methods...|$|R

40|$|Automatic {{detection}} of pig wasting diseases {{is an important}} issue in the management of group-housed pigs. Further, respiratory diseases are one of the main causes of mortality among pigs and loss of productivity in intensive pig farming. In this study, we propose an efficient data mining solution for the detection and recognition of pig wasting diseases using sound data in audio surveillance systems. In this method, we extract the Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) from sound data with an automatic pig sound acquisition process, and use a hierarchical two-level structure: the Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) and the Sparse Representation Classifier (SRC) as an early anomaly detector and a respiratory disease classifier, respectively. Our experimental results show that this new method can be used to detect pig wasting diseases both economically (even a cheap microphone can be used) and accurately (94 % detection and 91 % classification accuracy), either as <b>a</b> <b>standalone</b> <b>solution</b> or to complement known methods to obtain a more accurate solution...|$|R
