25|$|Coulomb (1776) first {{studied the}} problem of lateral earth {{pressures}} on retaining structures. He used limit equilibrium theory, which considers the failing soil block as a free body {{in order to determine}} the limiting horizontal earth pressure. The limiting horizontal pressures at failure in extension or compression are used to determine the Ka and Kp respectively. Since the problem is indeterminate, a number of potential failure surfaces must be analysed to identify the critical failure surface (i.e. the surface that produces the maximum or minimum thrust on the wall). Mayniel (1908) later extended Coulomb's equations to account for wall friction, symbolized by δ.

40|$|Underground mine <b>backfilling</b> {{is a form}} {{of ground}} {{improvement}} that has to be carried out in the mine sites. The <b>backfilling</b> provides ground support and regional stability, thus facilitating ore removal from nearby regions. The large underground voids created by the ore removal are <b>backfilled</b> with the waste tailings in the form of paste fills, hydraulic fills, and others. The tailings are placed in the form of slurry that undergoes self-weight consolidation. A small dosage of binder is added to paste fill and cemented hydraulic fill to enhance strength. Considering the high cement cost, mines are using fly ash and slag to partially replace cement with blended cements. This paper gives a practical overview of underground mine <b>backfilling</b> in Australia using paste fills and hydraulic fills. The mining methods and different types of <b>backfills</b> are briefly discussed, with major focus on paste fills and hydraulic fills...|$|R

30|$|Highwall mining {{systems can}} {{sometimes}} be the final mining method used in open cut mines, or it {{can serve as a}} means of transition, with low capital cost, from surface mining to underground mining. From the results of a series of laboratory tests and numerical analyses, stability of openings/pillars in the auger mining system is higher than that in CHM. The pillar strength for circular shape openings in the auger mining system is about 1.2 – 1.3 times stronger than that of the rectangular shape openings in CHM. The pillar strength index increases with the increasing pillar width for both shapes of openings. It is also found that <b>backfilling</b> improve the pillar stability. It improves the pillar stability by, increasing its Young’s modulus, the peak stress and the residual stress. From test results using the <b>backfilled</b> fractured pillar models, fractured pillars restore their strength by <b>backfilling.</b> It means that <b>backfilling</b> improves the fractured pillar behaviour very well. However, at greater depths, the effectiveness of <b>backfilling</b> cannot be obtained well. Based on this result, the highwall mining operation can be applied even in weak geological conditions by application of the appropriate mining system and/or <b>backfilling</b> system.|$|R

25|$|Fly ash is {{also used}} as a {{component}} {{in the production of}} flowable fill (also called controlled low strength material, or CLSM), which is used as self-leveling, self-compact <b>backfill</b> material in lieu of compacted earth or granular fill. The strength of flowable fill mixes can range from 50 to 1,200 lbf/in² (0.3 to 8.3 MPa), depending on the design requirements of the project in question. Flowable fill includes mixtures of Portland cement and filler material, and can contain mineral admixtures. Fly ash can replace either the Portland cement or fine aggregate (in most cases, river sand) as a filler material. High fly ash content mixes contain nearly all fly ash, with a small percentage of Portland cement and enough water to make the mix flowable. Low fly ash content mixes contain a high percentage of filler material, and a low percentage of fly ash, Portland cement, and water. Class F fly ash is best suited for high fly ash content mixes, whereas Class C fly ash is almost always used in low fly ash content mixes.|$|E

According to Douglas, Marshall was {{successful}} in portraying the Everglades from the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes to Florida Bayincluding the atmosphere, climate, and limestoneas a single organism. Rather than remaining the preserve of conservation organizations, the cause of restoring the Everglades became a priority for politicians. Douglas observed, [...] "Marshall accomplished the extraordinary magic of taking the Everglades out of the bleeding-hearts category forever". At the insistent urging of Marshall, newly elected Governor Bob Graham announced {{the formation of the}} [...] "Save Our Everglades" [...] campaign in 1983, and in 1985 Graham lifted the first shovel of <b>backfill</b> for a portion of the C-38 canal.

40|$|Abstract: Gravity {{retaining}} walls derive {{their capacity to}} resist lateral movement through the dead weight of the wall. The design methodologies proposed by standards do {{not take into account}} the construction sequences that simulate the process by which the soil and retaining wall are brought together. However, in reality, at least during the <b>backfilling</b> process, the retaining wall undergoes many displacements that are not so far considered in the design. In this investigation, effect of construction sequences in the gravity {{retaining walls}} with different shapes is investigated with the help of finite element method. Two different construction sequences, namely the <b>backfilling</b> after wall construction and the <b>backfilling</b> parallel to wall construction, are compared for different wall shape models. Lateral displacement of the bottom and the top of the wall is plotted for each model and construction sequence with construction stages. Bearing pressure distribution, lateral earth pressure and failure wedge angle are summarized and compared with design values. Each wall showed different behaviours for each of the construction sequences. Back filling after wall construction minimizes the sliding failure and bearing pressure. Overturning failure could be reduced by <b>backfilling</b> parallel to wall construction. However, it was observed that, comparatively, <b>backfilling</b> after wall construction is effective than <b>backfilling</b> parallel to wall construction, suggesting that proper selection of construction method also may reduce negative effects on the wall stability...|$|R
