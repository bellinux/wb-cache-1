Meessen died in Opsterland on 14November 1885 after being stricken by an illness three days earlier. The incomplete school was finished by Hidde Petrus Nicolaas Halbertsma.|$|E

500|$|On April 25, 1988, {{at the age}} of 52 (and 14 {{months after}} the death of Andy Warhol), Solanas died of {{pneumonia}} at the Bristol Hotel in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco. A <b>building</b> <b>superintendent</b> at the hotel, not on duty that night, had a vague memory of Solanas: [...] "Once, he had to enter her room, and he saw her typing at her desk. There was a pile of typewritten pages beside her. What she was writing and what happened to the manuscript remain a mystery." [...] Her mother burned all her belongings posthumously.|$|E
500|$|... "The Revenge" [...] {{was first}} {{read by the}} cast of the show on February 13, 1991 and was filmed {{in front of a}} live {{audience}} on February 20, 1991. Filming of the episode had been delayed two days due to President's Day. Both Alexander and Louis-Dreyfus praised the scene in which Jerry and George discuss the types of employment George could apply for after he quit his job. Louis-Dreyfus stated she was jealous that she was not in the scene. A number of scenes in the episode were removed prior to broadcast, such as one in which George and Kramer meet in the hallway and Kramer informs George that Jerry has gone to the laundromat. The writers decided that George could just say Kramer told him Jerry was at the laundromat and, upon that addition, the scene was cut. Initially, during Jerry and George's conversation about jobs, George mentions Regis Philbin, when they discuss George being a talk show host. Additional dialogue between George and Jerry at the laundromat was also removed. Because the episode [...] "The Stranded" [...] did not air until mid season three, the few references [...] "The Revenge" [...] contained to the episode, were cut. The Newman subplot was significantly reduced; the character initially appeared in one scene, but it was never filmed. In that scene, he would have explained to Jerry and Kramer that he jumped from the roof, but an awning broke his fall, though Jerry and Kramer would remain skeptical. The episode also involved the second appearance of Harold the <b>building</b> <b>superintendent,</b> who had previously appeared in [...] "The Apartment". Harold would inform the main characters that Newman made up the story about the awning breaking his fall, though, with the reduction of the Newman subplot, the scene was removed.|$|E

Baker confronted Oswald at gunpoint. He let Oswald pass after Truly identified him as an employee. According to Baker, Oswald did not appear to be nervous or out of breath. Truly said that Oswald appeared [...] "startled" [...] when Baker aimed his gun at him. According to the Warren Commission, Oswald was next seen by a secretary as he crossed through the second-floor business office carrying a soda bottle. He left the Texas School Book Depository through its front door at approximately 12:33p.m..|$|E
