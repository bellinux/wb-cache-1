25|$|Carmina Burana (abbreviated CB) is a {{manuscript}} written in 1230 by two different scribes {{in an early}} gothic minuscule (small letters; what is today called lower-case, as opposed to majuscule – large, capital, upper-case, used in Roman manuscripts) on 119 sheets of parchment. In the 14th century, a number of free pages, cut of a slightly different size, were attached {{at the end of}} the text. At some point in the Late Middle Ages the handwritten pages were bound into a small folder, called the Codex Buranus. However, in the process of binding, the text was placed partially out of order, and some pages were most likely lost as well. The manuscript contains eight miniatures: the rota fortunae (which actually is an illustration from the songs CB 14–18, but was placed by the <b>book</b> <b>binder</b> as the cover), an imaginative forest, a pair of lovers, scenes from the story of Dido and Aeneas, a scene of drinking beer, and three scenes of playing games – dice, tables, and chess.|$|E

5000|$|Detchōsō (粘葉装), or [...] "glued books": To {{create these}} <b>books,</b> <b>binders</b> took a double-wide {{piece of paper}} and folded it {{vertically}} to create a single, connected piece of paper with four printable sides. A number of these folded pages would then be stacked and bound together by applying glue to the creased edges, the front page, and the back page, then mounting the glued surfaces with a cover made from a continuous piece of paper. This binding method was used primarily for hand-copied manuscripts.|$|R

Sudek figures symbolically in the novel; David Kozol's mother in law worked as a <b>book</b> <b>binder</b> and it was through apprenticeship to a <b>book</b> <b>binder</b> that Josef Sudek became interested in photography. The characters seem to be symbolically injured or emotionally broken like the one armed Sudek and visual imagery figures prominently.|$|E
