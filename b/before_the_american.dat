5|$|On March 16, 1861, soon <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Civil War broke out, a {{convention}} in Mesilla voted that the provisional territory should secede from the Union {{and join the}} Confederate States of America. Lewis Owings remained as territorial governor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Revolution, Hancock {{was one of}} {{the wealthiest}} men in the Thirteen Colonies, having {{inherited}} a profitable mercantile business from his uncle. He began his political career in Boston as a protégé of Samuel Adams, an influential local politician, though the two men later became estranged. Hancock used his wealth to support the colonial cause as tensions increased between colonists and Great Britain in the 1760s. He became very popular in Massachusetts, especially after British officials seized his sloop Liberty in 1768 and charged him with smuggling. Those charges were eventually dropped; he has often been described as a smuggler in historical accounts, but the accuracy of this characterization has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{was born}} in Fairview, Kentucky, to a {{moderately}} prosperous farmer, and grew up on his older brother Joseph's large cotton plantations in Mississippi and Louisiana. Joseph Davis also secured his appointment to the United States Military Academy. After graduating, Jefferson Davis served six years as a lieutenant in the United States Army. He fought in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), as the colonel of a volunteer regiment. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Civil War, he operated a large cotton plantation in Mississippi and owned as many as 74 slaves. Although he argued against secession in 1858, he believed states had an unquestionable right to leave the Union.|$|E

5|$|Higginbotham was {{involved}} in the transition to open democratic elections in South Africa. He had visited South Africa in 1982 with other black jurists and had been appalled by the racial oppression he found and analogized to <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Civil War. After apartheid's demise, Higginbotham consulted with Nelson Mandela and founded the South Africa Free Election (SAFE) Fund. He raised several million dollars to support fair elections in South Africa, and served as one of the international mediators of the first inter-racial elections in South Africa in 1994. After the election, he helped South Africa's newly elected government draft a new constitution.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{ratification}} {{and implementation of}} the United States Constitution, the thirteen sovereign states followed the Articles of Confederation, created by the Second Continental Congress and ratified in 1781. However, the national government that operated under the Articles of Confederation was too weak to adequately regulate the various conflicts that arose between the states. The Philadelphia Convention set out to correct weaknesses of the Articles that had been apparent even <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Revolutionary War had been successfully concluded.|$|E

5|$|Riverside and Avondale were {{developed}} out of former plantation land. Most {{of this area}} was part of two plantations: Dell's Bluff, granted by the Spanish Florida government in 1801, and a tract eventually known as Magnolia Plantation, granted in 1815. Both changed hands several times <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Civil War. In 1868, Dell's Bluff's then owner, Miles Price, sold off {{the southern part of}} the plantation to Florida Union editor Edward M. Cheney and Boston developer John Murray Forbes, who platted the original Riverside development. The northern part Price developed himself as Jacksonville's Brooklyn neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|The Nathaniel Backus House's namesake is its builder Nathaniel Backus, a descendent of William Backus and William Backus, Jr., two of {{the founders}} of Norwich, Connecticut.

Nathaniel Backus was also {{recorded}} to be one of six men in Norwich to own their own carriages <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Revolutionary War. Nathaniel Backus died in 1773.|$|E
5|$|The land in question, {{which had}} been part of the Seneca Nation's {{traditional}} territory for centuries <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Revolution, comprised part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase, a tract of land disputed after the war between claims of New York and Massachusetts. By a December 16, 1786 interstate compact, the states agreed that Massachusetts would retain the proprietary rights and the pre-emption rights, but New York would retain governmental rights. After the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1787, the federal government ratified their compact.|$|E

5|$|The state's five public {{universities}} are {{administered by the}} University System of New Hampshire, {{which is the largest}} provider of postsecondary education in the state. New Hampshire is also served by a network of seven public, technical community colleges. The oldest school in the state is Dartmouth College, a member of the Ivy League and the only New Hampshire institution founded <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Revolution. The newest is the University of New Hampshire at Manchester, founded as a branch campus of the University of New Hampshire in 1985. Enrollment sizes range from small, liberal arts colleges with fewer than 100 students to the flagship state school University of New Hampshire in Durham, which serves over 14,000 on-campus students.|$|E
5|$|Thom {{was born}} in Minonk, Illinois in 1872, the fifth of six boys. His parents were Angus Sutherland Thom and Louisa (Herick) Thom, Scottish/Irish farmers who had settled in Illinois shortly <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Civil War. Charles Thom {{was raised in a}} {{strongly}} religious household; his father was an elder in the Presbyterian church. Thom upheld Presbyterian values throughout his life, kept active in church affairs, and became a staunch prohibitionist. His early years spent working on his father's farm instilled the value of a strong work ethic, and first-hand knowledge of agricultural practices that would prove useful in his later career.|$|E
5|$|Though its {{predecessor}} units have lineage {{that dates back}} <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Civil War, the formation was not formally designated as the 20th Engineer Brigade until its activation on 16 August 1950, at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. Deploying overseas in November 1952, it supported construction projects in southwestern France until its return to the US on 10 September 1954.

5|$|A {{few months}} after the 1969 debut of Sesame Street on PBS in the US, {{producers}} from Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Iran and Germany requested that the organization responsible for the show's production, the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), create and produce versions of Sesame Street in those countries. Even <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> show's debut, the CTW established an international division, which oversaw its licensing in other countries. According to Gregory J. Gettas, the division immediately developed four main licensing policies: (1) Like the American version, all foreign versions had to be broadcast without commercials; (2) any changes would have to meet high production standards, which protected the CTW's proprietary interests; (3) all versions had to reflect the country's cultural values and traditions; and (4) all changes would have to be approved, initiated, and supervised by a local committee working with the CTW.|$|E
5|$|Charles A. Dibble (born 1836 in Saratoga County, New York), {{by various}} {{accounts}} a railroad man, livery stable owner, and Civil War veteran, lived in Eldon {{in the late}} nineteenth century. He and his wife, Catharine, began building the house in 1881 for themselves and their eight children. Its relatively simple board-and-batten siding, white color, and moderate size—just —were quite common in nineteenth century Iowa architecture. A similar style can be observed in the birthplace of President Herbert Hoover in West Branch, built a decade <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Gothic House, which features board-and-batten siding, a simple shingled roof, a central chimney, white color, and a moderate size as well. Unique and unusual exterior features of the house include its two Gothic windows in the gable and its steep-pitched roof. Both features would later be exaggerated by Grant Wood in American Gothic. The lower floor of the house contains three rooms and a bathroom, while the upper floor has two bedrooms. The house has been called the best-known example of a Carpenter Gothic cottage in the United States.|$|E
5|$|General Edward Braddock left Observatory Hill in Georgetown in 1755 on an {{expedition}} to capture the French Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War. Braddock's expedition was surprised on July 9 {{in the vicinity of}} present-day Braddock, Pennsylvania, in what is now known as the Battle of the Monongahela. Nearly 900 of Braddock's 1,300 men were killed or wounded, and Braddock himself killed. Since <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Civil War, witnesses say that on the anniversary of Braddock's departure they can hear shouted military orders, horses' hooves on cobblestones, the sound of men marching, and the sound of metal clanking against metal. The sounds can be heard near the old Long Bridge or near the Georgetown bluffs overlooking the Potomac River.|$|E
25|$|HMS Highflyer was {{originally}} an American privateer schooner built in 1811. As a privateer she took several British vessels as prizes. The Royal Navy captured her in 1813.

5|$|Pundits {{and fans}} who opposed Kansas' {{selection}} {{pointed to the}} Jayhawks' strength of schedule, which {{at one point during}} the season was as low as 109th out of 119Division I teams. By the time of the BCS selection, however, Kansas's strength of schedule had climbed by a small amount, reaching 88th in the Sagarin rankings and 74th in the CBS rankings. The final rankings rated Kansas' schedule as more difficult than Hawaii, which was also selected to play in the BCS. Aggravating the situation was the fact that Kansas and Missouri had one of the most intense rivalries in college football. Known as the Border War, the roots of the rivalry dated to the years <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Civil War.|$|E

The box-office performance was considered a flop with the film only earning back 54% of its budget.|$|E
5|$|The {{intersection}} of 7th Street NW and H Street NW {{is the heart}} of D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood today, but prior to the 1930s it was populated primarily by German immigrants. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Civil War, 7th Street NW was the city's primary commercial district, the street lined with three-story Federal-style townhouses with shops on the ground floor and residences above. Lincoln conspirator Mary Surratt's boarding house (604 H Street NW) has been substantially renovated through the years (and currently houses a Chinese restaurant), but it may also house Mary Surratt's ghost. From the 1870s onward, occupants of the building have claimed that Surratt's spirit is responsible for the incomprehensible mumbling and whispers, footsteps, muffled sobs, and creaking floorboards which have unnerved them.|$|E
