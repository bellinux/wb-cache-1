25|$|France {{abolished}} slavery {{within the}} French Kingdom (continental France) in 1315. In May 1787 the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade {{was formed in}} London England to end the British slave trade. Revolutionary France abolished slavery in France's colonies in 1794, although it was restored by Napoleon with the Law of 20 May 1802 {{as part of a}} program to ensure French sovereignty over its colonies. Haiti formally declared independence from France in 1804 and brought an end to slavery in its territory. The northern states in the U.S. all abolished slavery by 1804. The United Kingdom and the United States outlawed the international slave trade in 1807, after which Britain led efforts to <b>block</b> <b>slave</b> ships. Britain abolished slavery throughout the British Empire with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, the French colonies re-abolished it in 1848 and the U.S. abolished slavery in 1865 with the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E

40|$|This {{monument}} traces African-American {{history from}} the Middle Passage, to the fight for freedom in the Civil War, the struggle for civil rights and emergence into mainstream America. Among the 12 scenes are images that depict a family on the auction <b>block,</b> <b>slaves</b> working in a rice field, men and women celebrating the Emancipation proclamation, the Jim Crow era, the Northern migration, and images of African Americans today pioneering in such fields as engineering, law education, sports, politics and space exploration. At {{the base of the}} monument's obelisk are four rubbing stones from regions of Africa where slaves were captured - Senegal, Sierra Leone, the Republic of Congo and Ghana. ...|$|R

5000|$|Originally, {{the area}} was termed [...] "Pea Ridge" [...] and {{was the site of}} a slave auction. Part of the {{original}} <b>slave</b> <b>block</b> still rests directly on Rt. 738 between the Partlow Post Office and Mt. Olive Rd (Rt. 658). A tavern was established by Capt. John C. Partlow on the same corner as the <b>slave</b> <b>block</b> called [...] "The Partlow Tavern". Capt. Partlow, along with Benjamin Waller, a descendant of John Waller (founder of Waller's Church) were persecuted for their religion and briefly jailed at one point for having services in their homes.|$|R
50|$|Walking {{into the}} hotel, {{one could see}} the large auction <b>block</b> where <b>slaves</b> were sold. The auction block was under the grand rotunda of the building. Some slaves were brought in by sea from Baltimore, only {{for a number of}} them to be sold {{immediately}} upon disembarking. As for the others, they were put into slave pens in the French Quarter.|$|R

This call leads Alice to a modern slave ring headed by a group of corrupt police officers. The leader of this group turns out to be Orlando Ruiz (a man Alice has just started to date) who captures Alice. Ruiz injects Alice with heroin to keep her {{compliant}} and puts her on the <b>slave</b> <b>block.</b>|$|R
50|$|Robertsville was {{established}} in 1804 by a merchant named Collins Roberts, who received a 4000 acre land grant. The community was located on the Old Emory Coach Road, and a natural spring in Robertsville called Cross Spring was a rest stop where travelers on that road could water and rest their horses. During the 19th century, Robertsville was also {{the site of a}} <b>slave</b> <b>block.</b> During the Civil War, however, community residents generally supported the Union cause.|$|R
30|$|The Superframe {{structure}} of MAC [45] comprises of Exclusive Access Periods (EAP-I/II), and Random Access Periods (RAP-I/II) using Traffic types Type-I and Type-II. The EAP-I and EAP-II {{are used to}} transmit emergency data {{with the support of}} TYPE-I. The RAP-I and RAP-II are used to transmit normal/periodic data with the support of TYPE-II. Both Types (I, II) inform the master node to allocate the slots when each node transmits data in the pre-allocated time slot. However, the master node <b>blocks</b> other <b>slave</b> nodes during data transmission of the one node in the pre-allocated time slot which consumes a higher amount of energy of other nodes in waiting. Another drawback is that one node can upload information at a time which degrades the performance of the suggested MAC in terms of a higher delay with the higher packets drop.|$|R
50|$|In this era, the Royal Navy {{provided}} services {{around the}} world that benefited other nations, such as the suppression of piracy and <b>blocking</b> the <b>slave</b> trade. The Slave Trade Act 1807 had banned the trade across the British Empire, after which the Royal Navy established the West Africa Squadron and the government negotiated international treaties under which they could enforce the ban. Sea power, however, did not project on land. Land wars fought between the major powers include the Crimean War, the Franco-Austrian War, the Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War, as well as numerous conflicts between lesser powers. The Royal Navy prosecuted the First Opium War (18391842) and Second Opium War (18561860) against Imperial China. The Royal Navy was superior to any other two navies in the world, combined. Between 1815 and the passage of the German naval laws of 1890 and 1898, only France was a potential naval threat.|$|R
50|$|The Richmond congregation's next rector, Joshua Peterkin (1814-1892), son of {{an officer}} from Baltimore who served in both the army and navy, led the parish from 1855 until his death 37 years later, {{assisted}} by several young priests, including his son, George William Peterkin, who became the first bishop of the Diocese of West Virginia. Rev. Joshua Peterkin had been known for his solicitude toward African Americans, having first served at St. James African Church in Baltimore shortly after graduating from Virginia Theological Seminary. However, like his two predecessors, Peterkin owned slaves. This church was originally located about a <b>block</b> from Richmond's <b>slave</b> market and built a gallery for African American congregants. Nonetheless, like his Bishop William Meade, Rev. Peterkin believed in educating all races, and soon reestablished the school to teach African Americans which Dr. Empie had established in 1845.|$|R
50|$|As {{described}} in a film magazine, Sir Derek Anstruther (Roscoe) while touring Egypt meets the slave Sheka (Barriscale), who looks European. He learns {{that she has been}} reared by a native bandit since the massacre of her mother's caravan in the desert. He falls in love with her. When she is offered for sale on the <b>slave</b> <b>block,</b> he outbids the natives and George Vincent (Wheatcroft), a scion of a wealthy family. Sir Derek marries her and takes her back to England as his wife. George with the aid of Diana Vane, who had hoped to win Sir Derek's title, promote discord in the Anstruther household. Pressed for money, Sir Derek says he would trade anything for 10,000 pounds. Sheka goes to sell herself to a notorious roue who has made advances towards her, and Sir Derek learns of her intentions and follows. When he arrives they discover that the roue has cleared up the mystery of Sheka's parentage, and that she is his heir. Sheka happily returns with Sir Derek.|$|R
5000|$|According to Guillory, {{the system}} of plaçage had a basis in the {{economics}} of mixed race. The plaçage of black women with white lovers, Guillory writes, could take place {{only because of the}} socially determined value of their light skin, the same light skin that commanded a higher price on the <b>slave</b> <b>block,</b> where light skinned girls fetched much higher prices than did prime field hands. Guillory posits the quadroon balls as the best among severely limited options for these near-white women, a way for them to control their sexuality and decide the price of their own bodies. She contends, [...] "The most a mulatto mother and a quadroon daughter could hope to attain in the rigid confines of the black/white world was some semblance of economic independence and social distinction from the slaves and other blacks" [...] (83). She notes that many participants in the balls were successful in actual businesses when they could no longer rely on an income from the plaçage system. She speculates they developed business acumen from the process of marketing their own bodies.|$|R
5000|$|After Caleb is {{condemned}} to be crucified, {{his mother is}} murdered when Roman soldiers carry out Pilate's orders to have Caleb's sisters Sarah and Ruth sent to Sejanus in Rome as [...] "gifts". Caleb is rescued {{on the way to}} execution, and goes to Rome to find them. He enlists as a gladiator, takes the name [...] "Metellus", meets and falls in love with Corinna, and is trained as a retiarius. Meanwhile, Ruth, grieving, provokes a Roman soldier to kill her during the voyage to Rome, and Sarah is made a slave in Sejanus' household, until he is executed for treason, and she then becomes part of Caligula's household. Tiberius, after ordering the execution of Sejanus, was himself secretly assassinated by Caligula, who has now become Caesar. Julius Valerius, having met Sarah on Sejanus' estate, has fallen in love with her, and when she is put on the <b>slave</b> <b>block</b> to be sold as part of an imperial fund-raising effort he, with the financial help of his parents and additional funds provided by Aquilla and Priscilla, Jewish tent-makers, buys her for himself and frees her to become his wife. Caleb is informed that Sarah is alive, but he is scandalized that she has married a Roman soldier. He meets Valerius and is soon confronted {{with the fact that he}} himself loves a Roman woman, now disinherited and disowned by her father.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) {{have become}} a popular {{platform}} for testing and implementing hardware designs by increasing their capacity and cost efficiency in the competition with Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). Processors {{can be used for}} any problem but they have not been optimized for specific problems. The design of ASIC is an extremely complex task, very time consuming and expensive; they are used for mass products. FPGA is an intermediate solution between general purpose processors and ASICs. Altera Cyclone V 28 nm is a System On Chip (SoC), which integrates a Hard Processor Core (HPS), peripherals, and memory controller with the FPGA fabric. However, HPS consist of only one-directional serial data (SDA) buses and serial clock (SCL) buses and provides support for a communication link only between integrated circuits on a board. It is necessary to build an I 2 C serial bus adapter in order to communicate between HPS and other devices outside the board. I 2 C serial bus adapter is implemented and tested in this thesis. It adapts the communication from one-directional serial data line of hard processor system to bi-directional data line. In order to test the I 2 C adapter in both writing data operation and reading data operation, Signal Generator blocks to generate testing signals are implemented and I 2 C <b>Slave</b> <b>block</b> from OpenCores to detect and display data to LEDs is used. All the blocks are implemented in VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL). The verifications for I 2 C Adapter, Signal Generator and I 2 C Slave are inspected by waveforms on Modelsim SE 10. 2 c simulator. The block implementations are compiled and programmed by Quartus II 13. 1 to DE 1 -SoC FPGA development board. DE 1 -SoC board buttons and LEDs are used to test the I 2 C adapter operation by a user. The results show that the adapter works as specified...|$|R
