40|$|This paper uses a {{new data}} set on {{budgetary}} institutions in Europe {{to examine the}} impact of fiscal rules and <b>budget</b> <b>procedures</b> in EU countries on public finances. It briefly describes the main pattern of budgetary institutions and their determinants across the EU 15 member states. Empirical evidence for the time period 1985 - 2004 suggests that the centralisation of <b>budgeting</b> <b>procedures</b> restrains public debt. In countries with one-party governments or coalition governments where parties are closely aligned and where political competition among them is low, this is achieved by the delegation of decision-making power to the minister of finance. Fiscal contracts that require countries to set multi-year targets and that reinforce those targets increase fiscal discipline in countries with ideologically dispersed coalitions and where parties regularly compete against each other. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explains}} why EMU countries seem {{unable or unwilling}} to undertake structural reforms of public expenditure. One of the reasons is political. What public expenditure reforms might be pursued without changing the political system? Without political reforms, technical improvements made to increase budget transparency, such as strengthening <b>budget</b> <b>procedure,</b> integrating accrual into cash accounting, and removing accounting gimmicks, could indirectly affect reforms of public expenditure. Removing gimmicks and helping prevent the emergence of new creative accounting techniques may be a partial substitue for political reforms. Implementation of the Growth and Stability Pact should be dynamically consistent with budgetary transparency. Although other EMU countries resorted as well to budgetary gimmicks to bypass difficult fiscal constraints, the Italian case is used as a reference to clarify these issues. Transparency may help discourage the use of gim micks. ...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{arguments}} {{of this paper is}} that complexity, lack of transparency, and convoluted laws and regulations make it very difficult to handle the Italian public finances and make debt reduction policies particularly difficult. In our view, a <b>budget</b> <b>procedure</b> can do two things: (1) make it possible for responsible governments or parliaments to run fiscal policy in a clear and transparent way; (2) {{make it more difficult for}} irresponsible governments or parliaments to hide their irresponsibility. We make several proposals that aim at simplifying the preparation, presentation and discussion of the various budget documents, with the goal of making it easier to detect and allocate the blame for irresponsible fiscal behaviour. We make a second set of proposals aimed at reinforcing the role of the treasury minister within the executive, and of the executive relative to parliament, to entrust the process to the agent that normally has the best information and incentives to enforce fiscal discipline...|$|E

40|$|Most of the EU {{budget is}} spent on redistribution. Large sums of money are {{transferred}} from the member state governments to Brussels and back to these governments. Some member states end up as net receivers and some as net payers. Most economists agree that {{the resources of the}} budget should be reallocated from redistribution towards the provision of more Union-wide public goods. While such appeals have been made for years, little change has been observed. We want to explain why. We propose to distinguish two periods. In {{the early years of the}} Community, some larger member states or coalitions of member states were able to credibly threaten to terminate membership if their claims on budgetary resources were not fulfilled. Their activity has created a redistributive status quo to which, in the second period, the budgetary rules of the Treaty were applied. It is shown that the combination of the Council’s qualified majority rule on the expenditure side and the unanimity rule on the revenue side and on the programs are largely responsible for creating a deadlock in the status quo with large redistribution and few Union-wide public goods. In order to break the deadlock, a complementary <b>budget</b> <b>procedure</b> is proposed on the basis of voting by veto. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{search for}} {{political}} support leads ultimately to upward deviations from forecasted public deficits when i) <b>budget</b> <b>procedures</b> are soft, ii) breaking promises made on higher expenditures and the lowering of taxes is costly in political terms, and iii) ex-post control by voters and political opposition is imperfect. This hypothesis is tested using a data set from Spanish municipalities {{during the period}} 1985 - 1995. Econometric estimates demonstrate that single-party majority incumbents are less prone to change forecasted budgets. While their forecasted deficits tend to be higher, they have lower actual deficits, which may be interpreted as the consequence of a higher consistency in the budgetary process. Secondly, upward deviations in deficit tend to rise in election years. While forecasted deficits are not different in election years, actual deficits are. Moreover, elections cause systematic downward deviations in revenues. On the contrary, the incumbent’s ideology is not relevant when explaining deviations in deficit. Budget deficits, local governments, <b>budget</b> <b>procedures,</b> electoral promises. ...|$|R
