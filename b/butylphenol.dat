40|$|It {{has been}} known for several decades that {{cutaneous}} depigmentation, i. e., contact/occupational vitiligo, can be caused by some phenolic derivatives that have a similar structure to tyrosine. Among these phenolic depigmenting agents, 4 -tertiary <b>butylphenol</b> is the most potent. The cutaneous depigmentation induced by phenolic derivatives results from the loss of functional melanocytes. Tyrosinase is a melanocyte specific copper-containing enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of the amino acid tyrosine, through a complex series of intermediates, to melanin. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the cytotoxicity induced by 4 -tertiary <b>butylphenol</b> is mediated by tyrosinase and occurs via an apoptotic process. Melanocyte cultures derived from African-American and Caucasian donors exhibiting a 3 -fold difference in tyrosinase activity and 14 -fold difference in melanin content demonstrate comparable concentration-dependent sensitivity to 4 -tertiary <b>butylphenol.</b> In addition, cultures of dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes exhibited similar and reduced sensitivity, respectively, to 4 -tertiary <b>butylphenol</b> compared with autologous melanocytes. Two melanoma cell lines, one melanotic and one amelanotic lacking the expression of both tyrosinase protein and activity, when transfected with the tyrosinase cDNA, exhibited no alteration in its sensitivity to 4 -tertiary <b>butylphenol.</b> These data suggest that 4 -tertiary <b>butylphenol</b> cytotoxicity is not mediated via tyrosinase.

These measurements is a Swedish contribution to an “OSPAR base line one off survey” with sampling and analysis of SCCPs and 2, 4, 6 -tri-tert-butylphenol in sediments collected in Göta Älv estuary on the Swedish west coast. This sampling was planned according to the advice to the design of the one-off surveys of chemicals identified for priority actions by ICES 2005 according to points 1 - 3 : 1. The purpose of the one-off surveys is to gain a rapid overview of the occurrence of certain priority chemicals in the marine environment. This could be achieved already by small scale surveys through a limited number of samples, using one sampling type only (for example sediments) and concentrating sampling in estuaries; 2. A minimum of five samples per Contracting Party was required for a focused survey comprising one sample for reference, two samples from polluted areas and two samples from less polluted areas; 3. Sampling could be carried out for the purpose of several one-off surveys for different substances if provided in quantities of 50 - 500 g of the top centimetres of the sediments. If frozen and kept in a sample bank, the samples could be used at any time when the budget became available for their analysis and for the completion of the survey; This project was carried out in cooperation between IVL and the consultant Marine Monitoring Ltd.

40|$|Probucol is a {{cholesterol-lowering}} and antioxidant {{drug that}} {{has been shown to}} inhibit or delay the progression of athero-sclerosis. This antiatherosclerotic effect may result from the removal of oxidized cholesterol on the surface of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). To investigate whether probucol transfers oxidized cholesterol from LDL to urine, urine samples were obtained from five patients with hypercholes-terolaemia treated with 500 -mg probucol orally daily and from five healthy controls. Using gas chromatography- mass spectrometry, we identified cholesteryl- 6 -(2, 6 -di-tertiary butylphenol- 4) -thioether (CT) in the urine samples from patients with hypercholesterolaemia but not from healthy controls.

The peroxide product presents a different electroactivity to that of the phenolic compound, with the appearance of a redox process involving cathodic and anodic symmetrical peaks at − 0. 10 / 0. 15 V versus SCE, which indicates the preference of the polymer to adhere onto the electrode surface.

Patients for whom an exogenous provoking factor was recorded were sent a questionnaire. Subsequently, patients who mentioned a chemical provoking factor were contacted to elucidate the alleged causal relationship between exposure to the chemical and the onset of vitiligo.

40|$|Introduction: Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} {{is a common}} condition with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 19. 5 %. The diagnosis is confirmed by patch tests. This study aims to visualise trends and developments in patch testing over 23 years and to evaluate the influence of legal restrictions with special interest in chromate. Chromate was a notorious allergen in cement, but in 2003 the European Council issued chromate restrictions for cement, which might influence the frequency of sensitizations Methods: Retrospective study to evaluate the patch test results of the dermatology department of the University Medical Center Groningen between January 1989 and January 2012. Patch tests were performed with the extended European Baseline series according to the guidelines of the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group and results were read on day 2 and day 3 or on day 3 and day 7. Results: In 23 years 11 983 consecutive patients were patch tested with the extended European baseline series. The patch tested population became significantly older, with a growing female preponderance, but a relative stable influence of occupational factors. Overall, the three most frequent contact allergens were nickel (18. 2 %), fragrance mix I (5. 6 %) and cobalt chloride (4. 9 %). Over two decades, the prevalence of nickel, paraphenylene diamine (PPD), methylchoroisothiazolinone/ methylisothiazolinone (MCI/MI) and, paratertiary <b>butylphenol</b> formaldehyde (PTBF) sensitisations increased, while a significant decrease was observed {{in the number of}} sensitisations to fragrance mix I, colophonium, quinoline mix, formaldehyde and thiuram. The number of sensitisations to potassium dichromate did not significantly decrease since 2003; however the patient characteristics of those reacting to potassium dichromate did change. Discussion: The influence of the legal chromate restrictions was not visible in this study. Chromate might have been restricted in cement; however it is not restricted in leather, which might explain the absence of a decline in sensitisations to chromate. Furthermore, a number of patients might have been sensitised before legal restrictions were introduced. The same is true for nickel restrictions. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the patch test results of the baseline series are subject to trends and other developments over time, but respond slowly to legal restrictions...|$|E

An unusual “n-butyllithium trap“ mixed-ligand lithium aggregate, [( 3,  3 -EDBP) Li 2] 2 [( 3 -nBu) Li(0. 5 Et 2 O) ] 2 (13) is obtained from the reaction of EDBP-H 2 with 3. 6 molar equiv of nBuLi in high yield.

Also, compound 13 reacts with 2 molar equiv of bidentate ligand, 2 -ethoxyethanol to yield [( 3,  3 -EDBP) Li 2] 2 [( 3 -OCH 2 CH 2 - OEt) Li] 2 (16). Further treatment of 14 or 15 with excess THF gives penta-nuclear species [( 2,  3 -EDBP) 2 Li 4 (THF) 3][( 4 -OR) Li] (OR = OBn (17) and OnBu (18)).

In particular, experimental results show that 14 and 16 efficiently initiate the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of L-lactide in a “controlled” fashion yielding polymers with very narrow polydispersity indexes (PDIs) {{in a wide range of}} monomer to initiator ratios. More importantly, a combination of free radical polymerization and ROP of lithium alkoxide macroinitiator enables us to synthesize PS-b-PLLA copolymers in which are useful templates to nanoscale materials.
