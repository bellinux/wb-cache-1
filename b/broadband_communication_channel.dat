The reference signal-based channel estimation method has significant advantages in small error and low complexity, thus widely applied in modern wireless transmission systems. Different {{from the traditional}} channel estimation method which only considers the maximum delay in channel transmission, the compressive sensing (CS) theory-based method takes advantage of time domain sparsity of wireless <b>broadband</b> <b>communication</b> <b>channel,</b> and adopts parameterized estimation method to accomplish channel state detection through the estimation of position and gain of each transmission path, which can decrease the length of reference signal and improve the performance of channel estimation.|$|E

Natural and synthetic multimedia content can be mixed and transmitted over narrow and <b>broadband</b> <b>communication</b> <b>channels.</b> Synthetic and natural hybrid coding (SNHC) within MPEG- 4 provides tools for 3 D mesh coding (3 DMC). We investigate the robustness {{of two different}} 3 D watermarking algorithms for polygonal meshes with respect to 3 DMC.

The second algorithm is a robust non-blind one-bit watermarking scheme intended for copyright protection applications. Both algorithms have been proposed by Benedens 1, 2.

We use the 3 DMC implementation provided with the MPEG- 4 reference software and the Princeton Shape Benchmark 7 model database for our simulations. The watermarked models are sent through the 3 DMC encoder and decoder, and the watermark decoding process is performed.

Since electronic monitoring systems, including antennas implemented inside the firefighter jacket, should provide high data rates, communication over a wideband channel is required. We study an 80 -MHz-wide body-to-body channel at 3. 6 GHz between two firefighters of a Rapid Intervention Team (RIT) performing the primary search for victims, by static and dynamic channel sounder measurements. Two ultra-wideband (UWB) substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity-backed slot textile antennas were unobtrusively deployed {{in the front and}} the back sections of the firefighters' jackets, providing up to 2 x 2 MIMO communication.

40|$|Recently, OFDM {{systems have}} been {{proposed}} {{as a solution to}} solve <b>broadband</b> railway <b>communication</b> problems. <b>Channel</b> estimation and equalisation for OFDM system become challenging when the mobile terminal is moving at high speed as the OFDM subcarriers lose their orthogonality in such situations. In this paper we present a novel channel estimation algorithm based on the hyperbolic modelling of rapidly varying channels. The hyperbolic model is based on the observation of the OFDM frequency domain channel matrix provided by rapid channel simulator, and on mathematical analysis of the off-diagonal elements of the channel matrix. The hyperbolic model can be combined with an FFT interpolation technique and then used to perform an iterative least square estimation of the channel matrix even when sparse pilot distribution is used. Furthermore, a sliding window discrete optimisation procedure is introduced to improve the performance of the suboptimal Linear Minimum Mean Square (LMMSE) channel equalisation technique. Numerical results for a mobile moving at 280 km/h and under the Wide Sense Stationary Uncorrelated Scattering (WSSUS) channel assumption are reported.

30|$|Traditional least {{mean square}} (LMS) {{is one of}} the most popular {{algorithms}} for adaptive system identification [9], e.g., channel estimation. LMS-based adaptive channel estimation can be easily implemented due to its low computational complexity. In current <b>broadband</b> wireless <b>communication</b> systems, <b>channel</b> impulse response in time domain is often described by a sparse channel model, supported by a few large coefficients. The LMS-based adaptive channel estimation method never takes advantage of the channel sparse structure although its mean square error (MSE) lower bound has a direct relationship with finite impulse response (FIR) channel length. To improve the estimation performance, recently, many algorithms have been proposed to take advantage of the sparse nature of the channel. For example, based on the recent theory of compressive sensing (CS) [10, 11], various sparse channel estimation methods have been proposed in [12 – 14]. Some of these methods are known to achieve robust estimation, e.g., sparse channel estimation using least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator [15]. However, these kinds of sparse methods have two potential disadvantages: one is that computational complexity may be very high, especially for tracking fast time-variant channels; the other is that training signal matrices for these CS-based sparse channel estimation methods are required to satisfy the restricted isometry property [16]. It was well known that designing these training matrices is a non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard problem [17].|$|R

40|$|Recently, joint spatio-temporal {{equalization}} (S/T-Equalization) {{techniques have}} been recognized as potential technological basis that can achieve significant enhancement in signal transmissionperformances over <b>broadband</b> mobile <b>communication</b> <b>channels.</b> S/T-Equalization is a unified concept combining adaptive array antennas and temporal equalizer concepts. Obviously, a purpose of S/T-Equalization is to endow receivers with theimmunity against co-channel interference (CCI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI), aiming at allowing all users {{to use the same}} frequency- and time-slots without spreading their signals in the frequency domain. Various signal processing algorithms for S/T-equalizers have been proposed. Refs. [1] and [2] survey the historical background of the technology, and summarize current trends in S/T-equalizer algorithm development. Despite the volume of efforts made on algorithm development, few papers have examined in-field performance [3]-[5]. We have presented initial investigation results on the effectiveness of S/T-Equalization techniques under real mobile radio propagation environments through link-level simulations using two-dimensional channel sounding field measurement data [6], [7]. The link-level simulation focuses on analyzing/evaluating the impact of S/T-equalizer configurations, parameters, and algorithms on performance in the field. A reasonable extension of the link-level simulations is the simulations that aim to obtain system-level performance figures such as geographical distribution of signal-to-interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) in the areas of interest as well as outage probability. The main focus {{of this paper is to}} evaluate outage probabilities of a cellular communication system featuring an S/T-equalizer, taking into account the presence of multiple interferers that use the same time- and frequency-slots. Two-dimensional channel sounding field measurement data gathered in a typical urbane area of Tokyo is used in thesimulations. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes in detail the S/T-equalizer configuration investigated in this paper. The algorithm used to determine the tap weights in the S/T-equalizer is also presented in Section 2. In Section 3, the simulation methodology for evaluating system-level performance figures of theS/T-equalizer using two-dimensional channel sounding field measurement data is introduced. In section 4, uplink outage probabilities for various S/T-equalizer configurations, obtained as results of the simulations, are presented. Finally, a major conclusion of this paper is drawn in Section 5. URSI General Assembly, Maastricht, Aug. 200...|$|R
