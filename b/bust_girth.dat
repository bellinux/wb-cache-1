40|$|Independently of {{the amount}} of adipose tissue, certain {{patterns}} of fat distribution increase the risk of non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Although the ratio of waist to hip (WHR) circumferences has been consistently related to diabetes mellitus, it is possible that only two measures do not completely characterize fat topography. The current study, therefore, examines the cross-sectional relation of six girths (waist, hip, neck, bust, wrist, and ankle) to diabetes mellitus in 43, 595 women. As compared with non-diabetics, Quetelet index (kg/m 2) and all circumferences were elevated among diabetics. Stratified analyses showed that WHR, and waist, neck, and <b>bust</b> <b>girths</b> were consistently related to diabetes independently of the degree of overweight. As estimated from a logistic regression model that simultaneously controlled for age and all anthropometric variables, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was positively related to Quetelet index, and to the waist, <b>bust,</b> and neck <b>girths,</b> with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1. 4 to 2. 6. However, diabetes was inversely related to hip (OR = 0. 61) and ankle (OR = 0. 73) girths; p less than 0. 005 for each association. Although cross-sectional in nature, these results suggest that an adverse body fat distribution {{is not limited to the}} abdominal region, but that a relative preponderance of adipose tissue in various regions of the upper body is associated with diabetes mellitus in women...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{variations}} of children's body shapes and sizes in order to develop a standard sizing system for children's wear using the anthropometric data. An anthropometric survey was conducted to measure 2050 male and female children within the age group of 7 to 17. The children is a representative of major ethnic groups in Malaysia namely the Malay, Chinese and Indian from both urban and rural areas in Selangor which is one of the states of Malaysia. Multivariate statistical techniques were used to analyze the data, including principal component analysis, k-means clustering, and decision tree technique. Four key dimensions were selected based on the PCA technique namely the height, chest, <b>bust</b> and hip <b>girth</b> which were revealed as the most significant variables. Consequently, these dimensions were used to divide the sample population into homogenous groups according to upper and lower body using cluster analysis technique. The cluster groups categorized the body shapes and sizes of the sample population. These cluster groups are then verified using the decision tree technique, which gave a profile of each cluster groups. The percentage of correctness of classification for each cluster group is high ranging between 80 % to 90 %. With the classified rules obtained from the decision tree technique, eight sizing systems were developed for female and male in two age groups; 7 - 12 and 13 - 17 to fit the upper and lower body. The body sizing system successfully accommodates more than 90 % of the sample population. This body sizing system is validated using the aggregate loss of fit, which range between 2. 5 and 3. 2 cm lower than the ideal aggregate loss of 3. 6 cm. This shows that the sizing system is accurate. The total sizes for each sample group ranges between 24 and 28, which is lower as compared to sizing systems used for children in other countries such as Korea and Taiwan. This study presents a sizing model for children's wear, which is recommended to be use for the benefits of both the customers and manufacturers...|$|R

40|$|This study helps out-size {{consumers}} purchase swimsuits {{and improves}} fitness by classifying the torso of middle-aged obese women; in addition, {{it creates a}} size system based on each size interval for obese types. The criteria for {{subjects in this study}} were over 25 kg/m 2 of the BMI, over 85 cm of waist, and over 95 cm of bust; 199 females were surveyed. Three torso types were categorized by a cluster analysis into X type (the vertical size of hip girth was the biggest of the three and the waist was slender), H-O type (larger than other groups in <b>bust</b> <b>girth</b> with more fat above the circumstance of the abdomen), and Y type (the upper half of body development type and lower body fatness were between those of type X and those of type H-O).

40|$|Abstract: All the {{products}} people use or wear {{in everyday life}} should be designed by considering the users’ anthropometric features for best fit and function. This paper studied the anthropometric characteristics of middle-aged Korean women to examine wearing sensibility related to body shape. The anthropometric data included stature, chest height, waist height, hip height, crotch height, bust circumference, waist circumference, and hip circumference. Body measurements, front and side views and index values between girth measurements were used as the body shape comparison elements. The results obtained are as follows: 1) <b>Bust</b> <b>girth,</b> waist girth, and hip girth of middle-aged women showed greater values (6 %, 11. 4 %, and 3. 4 %, respectively) than in young women. 2) The drop value between hip girth and <b>bust</b> <b>girth</b> were 7. 3 cm in twenties, 3. 6 cm in thirties, 4. 2 cm in forties, 1. 5 cm in fifties, and 0. 7 cm in sixties. 3) For front and side shape examination, assuming a value of 1. 00 for the waist breadth and waist depth, the results in middle-aged women were 0. 7 and 1. 2 in bust and hip breadth, and 1. 1 and 1. 1 in bust and hip depth, respectively. The wearing sensibility related to body shape showed that abdomen, waist, and arm were most re-shaped elements by ageing. The results found from this study can be used effectively to design a better-fitted clothes and to revise standards for products and sizing system for maximizing users ’ satisfaction.

40|$|This study {{suggests}} apparel sizing systems for obese {{women in their}} twenties to fifties. Size Korea body measurement data were used for sampling the obese subjects by obesity judgment indices. A total of 7 obesity judgment indices frequently used in the clothing field were inspected and the measurement data of 499 females defined as “obese ” by over 5 obesity judgment indices were analyzed. The {{results of the study}} were as follows: A total of 2, 212 female body measurement data for the Size Korea Project were collected. These were compared with the 499 data of the obese women in the study. Except for all heights and some lengths correlating with heights, the measurements of obese women were larger than the entire group of females. <b>Bust</b> <b>girth,</b> hip girth, and height were selected as control dimensions of the outerwear covering the upper body; waist girth and hip girth were selected as control dimensions of the outerwear covering the lower body. In each crosstabulation table, 3 cm pitches and 5 cm pitches by <b>bust</b> <b>girth,</b> waist girth, and hip girth were compared in the aspects of coverage and coverage efficiency. Finally, sizing charts for outerwear covering the upper body and the lower body of obese women were established in the study through the comparison of the coverage and the coverage efficiency.

40|$|Starting from mid 2004, European clothes vendors will {{switch to}} a new {{standard}} system for designating the size of garments. This new system is defined in EN 13402 and based on body dimensions measured in centimeters. EN 13402 - 1 defines a standard list of body dimensions, namely head girth, neck girth, chest girth, <b>bust</b> <b>girth,</b> underbust girth, waist girth, hip girth, height, inside leg length, arm length, hand girth, foot length, and body mass. For each type of garment, the EN 13402 - 2 standard specifies a primary dimension, a body measurement in centimeters (or body mass in kilograms) that shall be used in designating its size. For some types of garment, where a single size is not adequate to select the right product, a secondary dimension is added. For use on language-neutral clothes labels, EN 13402 - 1 specifies a pictogram for each body dimension.

40|$|Since 1935, the bra sizing {{system has}} been based on <b>bust</b> <b>girth</b> and underbust girth. Woman's breast is however a very complex 3 D geometry, the {{existing}} sizing system based on just two girth measurements may be inappropriate in the categorization of breast sizes for bras. Through analyzing the nude breast measurements from 456 subjects aged between 20 and 39, we hereby propose a new bra sizing system for Chinese women. The new sizing system uses underbust girth and the breast depth width ratio as the classifying parameters. They were identified through principal component factor analysis and K-means cluster analysis as the two most critical parameters out of 98 measurements obtained from 3 D body scanning and 5 supplementary manual measurements as well as other relevant breast parameters including breast angles, distance, width, thickness, volume and curvature. Relevance to industry: The existing bra sizing system is inadequate in classifying breast sizes for bras. This paper presents a method for classifying nude breast shape for establishing a new bra sizing system. The application of the new sizing system will be important to improve fitting comfort in intimate apparel. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that elastic fibres (spandex and lycra) {{are used to}} impart stretch to fabrics. The amount the apparel stretches to fit depends on the elastic fibres’ characteristics and recovery properties, in providing pressure comfort and ease of movement. Made to fit, by comparison, is the construction of two-dimensional non-stretch pattern blocks using body darts to denote the 3 D form. Building patternmaking theory {{can lead to a}} better understanding of the body to garment interaction, and the fit of apparel. This investigation commences with the identification of garment block construction methods for woven and jersey apparel, and corresponding garment fit expectations, comparing two published patternmaking methods. It proposes a system of adding bust cup grading into non-stretch garment blocks. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method would be easy to implement and could generate patterns with an improved <b>bust</b> <b>girth</b> fit. The purpose of this paper is to show that a new grading system would better serve the female population than the system currently in use. This system would also be more efficient as it would reduce the consumer time spent in fit identification as labelling would also indicate bust cup sizing. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|Exploratory retail {{studies in}} South Africa {{indicate}} that plus-sized women experience problems and dissatisfaction with poorly fitting bras. The lack of 3 -D anthropometric studies for the plus-size women's bra market initiated this research. 3 -D body torso measurements {{were collected from}} {{a convenience sample of}} 176 plus-sized women in South Africa. 3 -D breast measurements extracted from the TC 2 NX 12 - 3 -D body scanner 'breast module' software were compared with traditional tape measurements. Regression equations show that the two methods of measurement were highly correlated although, on average, the bra cup size determining factor 'bust minus underbust' obtained from the 3 -D method is approximately 11 % smaller than that of the manual method. It was concluded that the total bust volume correlated with the quadrant volume (r = 0. 81), cup length, bust length and bust prominence, should be selected as the overall measure of bust size and not the traditional <b>bust</b> <b>girth</b> and the underbust measurement.

40|$|Abstract: This study helps out-size {{consumers}} purchase {{tops and}} improve the fitness of unde-weight women in their 20 s- 30 s and by {{the establishment of a}} size system. The criteria for subjects in this study were those under 18. 5 (kg/m 2 of the BMI; subsequently, a total of 233 females were enrolled. The results were: First, the nominal size for female adult formal dress suggested by the KS standard is suggested in 20 sections. The sections for underweight women are 7, (34 women who accounted for 14. 59 % out of 233 in total). The cover efficiency was 2. 08 % (which was very low). Second, tests showed that the average difference between the reference part body size of 7 sections for underweight women in the normal size section of bust cir. - hip cir. - height, and KS standard, waist cir. among reference sizes was rather small {{in the case of a}} nominal size for long height. Therefore, there is a significant difference with size in the KS standard and a sizing system proven improper for underweight woman. Third, the basic body sizes and reference body sizes were dif-ferent due to the size system establishment according to measurements of underweight subjects. The research findings suggest that it is necessary to understand underweight types according to <b>bust</b> <b>girth</b> and hip girth sizes that represent basic sizes as well as to design patterns that consider the underweight body shape characteristics when women's top...|$|E
