40|$|The routing {{problem in}} Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) is {{concerned}} with finding “good ” source-destination paths.

This paper presents the Mesh Routing Algorithm (MRA), a dynamic programming approach for computing high-capacity paths while simultaneously bounding the end-to-end delay. The proposed algorithm also provides the option for locating multiple link-disjoint paths, such {{that the amount of}} traffic through each path is proportional to its capacity.

40|$|For {{planetary}} lander missions such as {{the upcoming}} Phoenix mission to Mars, the most challenging phase of the spacecraft-to-ground communications is during the critical phase termed entry, descent, and landing (EDL). At 8. 4 GHz (X-band), the signals received by the largest Deep Space Network (DSN) antennas can be too weak for even 1 <b>bit</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (<b>bps)</b> and therefore not able to communicate critical information to Earth. Fortunately, the lander s ultra-high frequency (UHF) link to an orbiting relay can meet the EDL requirements, but the data rate needs to be low enough to fit the capability of the UHF link during {{some or all of}} EDL. On Phoenix, the minimum data rate of the as-built UHF radio is 8 kbps and requires a signal level at the Odyssey orbiter of at least - 120 dBm. For lower signaling levels, the effective data rate needs to be reduced, but without incurring the cost of rebuilding and requalifying the equipment. To address this scenario, a simple form of frequency-shift keying (FSK) has been devised by appropriately programming the data stream that is input to the UHF transceiver. This article describes this technique and provides performance estimates. Laboratory testing reveals that input signal levels at - 140 dBm and lower can routinely be demodulated with the proposed signaling scheme, thereby providing a 20 -dB and greater margin over the 8 -kbps threshold...|$|R
50|$|When used in {{the context}} of {{communication}} networks, such as Ethernet or packet radio, throughput or network throughput is the rate of successful message delivery over a communication channel. The data these messages belong to may be delivered over a physical or logical link, or it can pass through a certain network node.

40|$|The {{comparison}} between the performance of both wired and wireless networks is based on various performance parameters. The performance of the wired Ethernet is very sensitive {{to the number of}} users and the offered load. When the number of users/offered load is high then the collisions increase resulting in larger wastage of the medium and lowering overall throughput. The aim of this research is to compare the throughput of LANs using Ethernet and WiFi under three different scenarios: 25, 50 and 100 users using simulator OPNET-MODELER. By analyzing the graphs, it is concluded that throughput of Wireless LAN (WiFi) is greater than that of Ethernet with operating at transmission speed of 10 Mbps when sufficient number of users are deployed that the model can support. When the number of users is increased beyond the certain limit, throughput decreases. The throughput of Ethernet and WiFi keeps on increasing and decreasing within some specific range due to the propagation delay and overhead collisions affecting at that time. The throughput is usually measured in <b>bits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (bit/s or <b>bps)</b> or in data packets <b>per</b> <b>second</b> or data packets per time slot. II.

40|$|Modern {{multicore}} processors feature {{easily accessible}} temperature sensors that provide useful information for dynamic thermal management. These sensors were recently {{shown to be}} a potential security threat, since otherwise isolated applications can exploit them to establish a thermal covert channel and leak restricted information. Previous research showed experiments that document the feasibility of (lowrate) communication over this channel, but did not further analyze its fundamental characteristics. For this reason, the important questions of quantifying the channel capacity and achievable rates remain unanswered. To address these questions, we devise and exploit a new methodology that leverages both theoretical results from information theory and experimental data to study these thermal covert channels on modern multicores. We use spectral techniques to analyze data from two representative platforms and estimate the capacity of the channels from a source application to temperature sensors on the same or diﬀerent cores. We estimate the capacity to be in the order of 300 <b>bits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (<b>bps)</b> for the same-core channel, i. e., when reading the temperature on the same core where the source application runs, and in the order of 50 bps for the 1 hop channel, i. e., when reading the temperature of the core physically next to the one where the source application runs. Moreover, we show a communication scheme that achieves rates of more than 45 bps on the same-core channel and more than 5 bps on the 1 -hop channel, with less than 1 % error probability. The highest rate shown in previous work was 1. 33 bps on the 1 -hop channel with 11 % error probability...|$|E
40|$|American Sign Language (ASL) is a gestural {{language}} {{used by the}} hearing impaired. This paper describes experimental tests with deaf subjects that compared the most effective known methods of creating extremely compressed ASL images. The minimum requirements for intelligibility were determined for three basically different kinds of transformations: (1) gray-scale transformations that subsample the images in space and time; (2) two-level intensity quantization that converts the gray scale image into a black-and-white approximation; (3) transformations that convert the images into black and white outline drawings (cartoorzr). In Experiment 1, five subjects made quality ratings of 81 kinds of images that varied in spatial resolution, frame rate, and type of transformation. The most promising image size was 96 x 64 pixels (height X width). The 17 most promising image transformations were selected for formal intelligibility testing: 38 deaf subjects viewed 87 ASL sequences l- 2 s long of each transformation. The most effective code for gray-scale images is an analog raster code, which can produce images with 0. 86 normalized intelligibiliv (Z) at a bandwidth of 2, 880 Hz and therefore is transmittable on ordinary 3 KHz telephone circuits.

40|$|A new {{deep space}} {{transponder}} {{is being developed}} by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA. The Spacecraft Transponding Modem (STM) implements the standard transponder functions and the channel service functions that have previously resided in spacecraft Command/Data Subsystems. The STM uses custom ASICs, MMICs, and MCMs to reduce the active device parts count to 70, mass to I kg, and volume to 524 cc. The first STMs will be flown on missions launching in the 2003 time frame. The STM tracks an X-band uplink signal and provides both X-band and Ka-band downlinks, either coherent or non-coherent with the uplink. A NASA standard Command Detector Unit is integrated into the STM, along with a codeblock processor and a hardware command decoder. The decoded command codeblocks are output to the spacecraft command/data subsystem. Virtual Channel 0 (VC- 0) (hardware) commands are processed and output as critical controller (CRC) commands. Downlink telemetry is received from the spacecraft data subsystem as telemetry frames. The STM provides the following downlink coding options: the standard CCSDS (7 - 1 / 2) convolutional coding, ReedSolomon coding with interleave depths one and five, (15 - 1 / 6) convolutional coding, and Turbo coding with rates 1 / 3 and 1 / 6. The downlink symbol rates can be linearly ramped to match the G/T curve of the receiving station, providing up to a 1 dB increase in data return. Data rates range from 5 <b>bits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (<b>bps)</b> to 24 Mbps, with three modulation modes provided: modulated subcarrier (3 different frequencies provided), biphase-L modulated direct on carrier, and Offset QPSK.
