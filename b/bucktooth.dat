This work presents the first record of a feeding association between the <b>bucktooth</b> parrotfish, Sparisoma radians and the sailor's grunt Haemulon parra, on Tamandaré reefs, Southwestern Atlantic.

40|$|Parrotfishes (Labridae, Scarinae) {{comprise}} a large marine fish group of difficult identification, particularly during juvenile phase when the typical morphology and coloration of adults are absent. Therefore, {{the goal of}} this study was to test cytogenetic markers and DNA barcoding in the identification of <b>bucktooth</b> parrtotfish Sparisoma radians from the northeastern coast of Brazil. Sequencing of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) confirmed all studied samples as S. radians, and all showed high similarity (99 - 100 %) with Caribbean populations. The karyotype of this species was divergent from most marine Perciformes, being composed of 2 n = 46 chromosomes. These consisted of a large number of metacentric and submetacentric pairs with small amounts of heterochromatin and GC-rich single nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) not syntenic to 5 S rDNA clusters. These are the first data about DNA barcoding in parrotfish from the Brazilian province and the first refined chromosomal analysis in Scarinae, providing useful data to a reliable genetic identification of S. radians...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe <b>bucktooth</b> {{parrotfish}} Sparisoma radians, {{the striped}} parrotfish Scarus iseri and the bluelip parrotfish Cryptotomus roseus are three herbivorous fishes commonly found at juvenile stages in Caribbean seagrass beds. While the diet {{of the three}} species as adults is relatively well known, {{few studies have been}} conducted on the feeding patterns of juveniles. In this study, the resource use of the juveniles of three scarid species were studied using two complementary methods: gut content and stable isotope analyses (13 C: 12 C and 15 N: 14 N ratios). Bayesian mixing model approaches were used to calculate the contribution of each food item to fish diets (SIAR, mixing models). The three parrotfish species appeared to rely essentially on the consumption of fleshy macrophytes. Cryptotomus roseus consumed more benthic invertebrates and presented a higher trophic level than the two other scarid species. Scarus iseri presented a higher assimilation of benthic biofilm, in accordance with the high percentage of sediment in its gut content, and Sparisoma radians assimilated more Thalassia testudinum leaves. This research highlighted a food resources partitioning among the juveniles of the three herbivorous fishes, probably to avoid inter-specific competitive interactions for the most palatable food at a critical stage of their life...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} field {{studies suggest that}} sex change in animals may be more {{complicated}} than originally depicted by the size-advantage hypothesis. A modification of the size-advantage hypothesis, the expected reproductive success threshold model, proposes that sperm competition and size-fecundity skew can strongly affect reproductive pay-offs. Size-fecundity skew occurs if a large female's fecundity is markedly higher than the aggregate of {{the other members of}} her social group and, together with paternity dilution from sperm competition, can produce situations in which large females benefit by deferring sex change to smaller females. Deferral by large females can create sex-size distributions characterized by the presence of large females and small sex-changed males, and it is precisely these distributions that the traditional size-advantage model cannot explain. We tested the predictions of the new model with the <b>bucktooth</b> parrotfish, Sparisoma radians, on coral reefs in St. Croix, U. S. Virgin Islands. Collections and spawning observations determined that the local environmental regime of S. radians is characterized by pervasive sperm competition (accompanying 30 % of spawns) and factors that can produce substantial size-fecundity skew in social groups. Dominant male removal experiments demonstrate that the largest females in social groups often do not change sex when provided an opportunity. Instead, smaller, lower-ranking females change sex when a harem vacancy arises. This pattern of sex change is in contrast to virtually all previous studies of social control of sex change in fishes, but provides strong support for the general predictions of the expected reproductive success threshold model.
