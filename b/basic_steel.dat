Foster proposed a similar strategy, but on a much larger scale: a national campaign, led by a union council of all the craft unions and the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Tin and Steel Workers, that would organize all of <b>basic</b> <b>steel</b> simultaneously. Fitzpatrick agreed to put his name on the project and sent Foster as the CFL's delegate to the AFL's 1918 convention to present the plan.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} model based on reaction the rmodynamics {{has been developed}} to simulate <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>steel</b> making process for predicting hot metal composition inside Linz-Donawitz (LD) converter with respect to blowing time. This mode l also contributes to-wards the prediction of sloping phenomenon taken place during <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>steel</b> mak-ing process. Modelling of <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>steel</b> making process has significant utility as productivity and lining life of Basic Oxygen Steelmaking(BOS) is highly dependable upon mass, momentum, energy transfer and rigorous interaction among metal,slag and gaseous phases. Comprehensive thermodynamic model of <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>steel</b> making pro-cess has been developed to predict the bath composition and temperature as well as de-carburization rate dynamically based on relevant blowing process parameters. One of the striking features of this developed model {{is the first time}} prediction of temperature vari-ation depending on evolving bath composition and generated heat from bath composition dependent feasible reactions and their extent. Moreover, this {{numerical model}} does not require off gas analysis to maintain its dynamic nature of prediction. A true attempt for the benefit of steel industry is made for predicting slopping initiation time for particular blowing condition based on correlation with model predicted decarburization rate and critical decarburization rate for bloating of metal droplet. In connection to that, formation of foamy slag and sloping possibility have been studied using thermodynamic modelling followed by multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation technique. The CFD simulation has been carried out taking different turbulence models along with vol-ume of fluid method (VOF) using ANSYS 15. 0 software. CFD work demonstrates change in bath deformation profile during blowing period and also identifies the locations of dif-ferent vortexes formed owing to supersonic oxygen jet penetration. Dynamic mathemat-ical model of BOS has been interconnected with CFD simulation work for correlating fluid flow parameters with reaction behaviour inside BOS furnace. The results of devel-oped model has been comparedand validated with plant data.

40|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, {{specific}} primary energy {{use in the}} German steel industry has decreased by about 30 %.

In this paper, the relevance of various determinants for the diffusion of electric arc furnance steel (structural change) and for the energy-use of new technologies in the German steel industry sector is assessed econometrically. The empirical findings support the hypotheses that the diffusion of electric arc furnane steel is accelerated by enery and material input prices and dampened by path dependencies. The findings further suggest that the energy performance of new technologies is affected by energy and material input prices, by expenditures for research and development, and - for <b>basic</b> oxygen <b>steel</b> - also by industry concentration...|$|R
