500|$|On May 25, {{during a}} game against the Florida Marlins, Posey was injured during a {{collision}} with Scott Cousins at home plate as Cousins scored the eventual-winning run on a sac fly in the 12th inning of a 7–6 Giants' loss. In the aftermath, Posey suffered a fractured fibula and torn ligaments in his ankle, requiring season-ending surgery. Cousins, who was not disciplined, said he collided with Posey intentionally in order to score. [...] "If you hit them, you punish them and you punish yourself, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance of that ball coming out." [...] He expressed regret over injuring Posey, saying [...] "I certainly didn’t want him to get hurt." [...] Cousins received threats from fans, but Posey denounced them: [...] "I appreciate the continued support of Giants fans and others as I begin the process of working my way back ... But in no way do I condone threats of any kind against Scott Cousins or his family. As I said last week, I'm not out to vilify Scott." [...] In 45 games, Posey batted [...]284 with 17 runs scored, 46 hits, five doubles, four home runs, and 21 RBI.|$|E

[...] "There are lots of jazz singers, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> tear in your voice," [...] she says, offering to help with his budding career. With her help, Jack eventually gets his big break: [...] a leading part in the new musical April Follies.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{means that}} we're {{back at the}} surface all right, Perry," [...] I cried; [...] "but where, I don't know. I haven't opened her up yet. Been too busy {{reviving}} <b>you.</b> Lord, man, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> close squeak!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "So I imagined! Well, {{when you}} go too far I'll pull <b>you</b> up, <b>but</b> we needn't bother {{about it in the}} meantime. You were {{obviously}} born <b>a</b> hustler, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> ingenuousness that disarms resentment. In fact, you quite upset our views of the British character." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{the general}} said; [...] "I wish you good fortune; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> difficult, almost a desperate, service before you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Hilda, [...] "it doesn't matter, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> suspiciously complacent look. One {{could imagine}} that you felt {{satisfied}} with yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{know you}} are always in Our Lady's colours, Pauline, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pretty taste, and can {{convince}} Jane that rose colour and scarlet cannot go together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you lose, you {{and your}} friends will find the Butte pretty hot. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> feel <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance, a {{fighting}} chance, and you mean to take it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better {{think about}} the future," [...] Grahame interposed. [...] "Some people are {{practically}} immune from malaria; others get it moderately now and then, and some it breaks down for good. At first it's difficult to tell which class one belongs to, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> sharp attack. There's some risk of your spending {{the rest of your}} life as an ague-stricken invalid if you stick to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> pluck, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> chosen <b>a</b> hard {{road and}} given your friends a jar. But we are your friends; don't forget that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To my charge! to {{the charge}} of steel and gunpowder! and--well, if it must be, it must; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> tolerably good guess what's like to come of it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was lucky. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> curious temperament. When {{we began}} {{to talk of the}} accidents, you remembered the damage to Fuller's {{property}} before the risk to your life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] Jim declared. [...] "Girls of your type don't get left out. I {{dare say}} pretty girls are numerous, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> calm and a {{confidence}} that make their mark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well, Lucy; <b>but</b> if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> sick headache, <b>you</b> wouldn't like to <b>have</b> to write <b>a</b> d----d letter like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{the hurt}} is not bad, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> such <b>a</b> pretty arm for an operation; the {{pleasure}} of the thing might <b>have</b> tempted <b>a</b> novice." ...|$|R
5000|$|Zack Werner: [...] "I felt it, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> such <b>a</b> unique instrument, I {{want you}} to be as big and obnoxious as me. Or Jake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are some}} things," [...] replied the Abbot gravely, [...] "into {{which it was}} never {{intended}} that we should inquire. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> long road before you. Whither will you first turn?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Allan Quatermain, you are young, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good judgment; also, {{you are one}} of {{the very}} few who know Dingaan and can speak his language. Tell us now, what do you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your head is white, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> forked tongue. Mahtoree {{has been}} in your camp. He knows {{that you are not}} alone. Where is your young wife, and the warrior that I found upon the prairie?" ...|$|E

60|$|L. No; unless in {{the case}} of a {{transparent}} substance. <b>You</b> cannot <b>have</b> <b>a</b> transparent crystal of gold; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> perfectly pure one.|$|R
6000|$|... "At least," [...] said Father Tiebout, [...] "we both foresaw {{the result}} of it. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> long march. Is there {{anything}} I can offer you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} a fool," [...] said Osborn bitterly. [...] "You are a fool, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> vein of devilish cunning. You steal and forge; and then expect to shuffle off the {{consequences}} {{on to your}} relatives!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He laughed good-humouredly, {{and stroked}} {{one of the}} horses that turned its head to nibble affectionately at his shoulder. [...] "I'll be sorry for this by and by, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> habit of making me give myself away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, my dear Master Copperfield,' said she, 'far be {{it from my}} thoughts! <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{discretion}} {{beyond your}} years, and can render me another kind of service, if you will; and a service I will thankfully accept of.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Let me {{say again}} that the {{relationship}} is asymmetrical: there's no democracy without a market economy, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> market economy without democracy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry, blessed, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> can't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> terrace. Don't <b>you</b> {{realize that}} every brick {{would have to}} be carted two hundred miles through this wilderness?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{the first}} to admit that," [...] said the detective heartily. [...] "You get to your point, I admit; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> such <b>a</b> deuced round-the-corner way of doing it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} true--in the sense you mean. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> friend, and I have {{determined}} that you shall be comfortable in spite of yourself. When {{you get down to}} your house you will see what I have sent there for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I desire no such glory, {{and would}} wish to have no better {{lieutenant}} than you. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> subject of which you are really fond, which you are beginning to understand, and in regard to which you can make yourself useful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] said I, my head {{swimming}} {{now with}} champagne; [...] "I {{have a future}} perhaps--of a passing agreeable sort, thanks to you. I shall now have the honour of your name. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> past. Such a past as is worth all my future." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Aye, we'll have smart bidding {{amid the}} {{settlers}} for this lot. 'Cod, captain, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made <b>a</b> bargain of it! Od's bud! <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done these London fools to some purpose.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh no!' cried Rosette, 'he must be wicked, {{since he}} tried to drown me. Don't let us tell him, <b>but</b> if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> little basket give it to me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, we're {{practically}} twin souls, Mr Chalmers! Tell me, I {{know your}} game is nearly perfect, <b>but</b> if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fault, is it {{a tendency to}} putt too hard?' ...|$|R
