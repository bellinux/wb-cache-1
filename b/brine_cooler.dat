The micrographs showed changes in the protein matrix, dispersion of fat globules, and bacteria during processing. Most curd knitting occurred during the curd stirring step, particularly dry stirring. A thin (5,urn) curd skin was observed on curd particles at the end of dry stirring. Dry salting prior to stretching resulted in the rapid loss of whey from the curd particle. Protein fibers were aligned and longitudinal columns of whey and fat were formed when the cheese was stretched and molded. Bacteria were initial ly dispersed throughout the protein matrix, but after stretching, most of the bacteria were located at the fatwhey/ protein interface. <b>Brining</b> <b>cooled</b> the cheese causing the fat globules to solidify and additional whey to be expelled, resulting in fat globule indentations in the protein matrix.

40|$|AbstractThe sea ice {{microstructure}} is permeated by brine {{channels and}} pockets that contain concentrated seawater-derived <b>brine.</b> <b>Cooling</b> the sea ice results in further formation of pure ice within these pockets as thermal equilibrium is attained, {{resulting in a}} smaller volume of increasingly concentrated residual brine. The coupled changes in temperature and ionic composition result in supersaturation of the brine with respect to mirabilite (Na 2 SO 4 · 10 H 2 O) at temperatures below − 6. 38 °C, which consequently precipitates within the sea ice microstructure. Here, mirabilite solubility in natural and synthetic seawater derived brines, representative of sea ice at thermal equilibrium, has been measured in laboratory experiments between 0. 2 and − 20. 6 °C, and hence we present a detailed examination of mirabilite dynamics within the sea ice system. Below − 6. 38 °C mirabilite displays particularly large changes in solubility as the temperature decreases, and by − 20. 6 °C its precipitation results in 12. 90 % and 91. 97 % reductions in the total dissolved Na+ and SO 42 − concentrations respectively, {{compared to that of}} conservative seawater concentration. Such large non-conservative changes in brine composition could potentially impact upon the measurement of sea ice brine salinity and pH, whilst the altered osmotic conditions may create additional challenges for the sympagic organisms that inhabit the sea ice system. At temperatures above − 6. 38 °C, mirabilite again displays large changes in solubility that likely aid in impeding its identification in field samples of sea ice. Our solubility measurements display excellent agreement with that of the FREZCHEM model, which was therefore used to supplement our measurements to colder temperatures. Measured and modelled solubility data were incorporated into a 1 D model for the growth of first-year Arctic sea ice.

40|$|It is {{generally}} recognized that corrosion and scaling problems could seriously affect {{the operation and}} electric power production from a geothermal power plant. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) has sponsored a study at Battelle-Northwest (BNW) to develop a brine chemistry data base and analytical tools to analyze how corrosion and scaling affect the degradation of the power output of a geothermal plant. The GEOSCALE computer model is a steady-state thermal hydraulics code that describes the process parameters of the power plant. At present the multistage flash and binary cycle plants are being analyzed. Initially the code computes the power output from a given geothermal brine flow and provides flow rates, temperature, velocities at points {{from the bottom of}} the production wells through the plant to the waste injection system. Based on the starting brine chemistry and these process parameters, corrosion and scaling rates will be estimated at points throughout the system. The amount of scale formation in a time interval will be calculated and the impact on brine flows and heat transfer calculated, resulting in a new set of plant process parameters for the next iteration. The iterations continue until some portion of the plant is degraded to a process limit or a plant life of 20 to 30 years is reached. Obviously the most difficult part of this analysis is the lack of valid analytical expressions and supporting rate data to calculate scaling. The general approach to the scaling rate equations is that the rate of buildup is proportional to the degree of insolubility of a mineral minus the rate of mechanical removal. They are very interested in all current scaling work that could help in providing scaling kinetics data related to process parameters so they can test these analytical expressions. The program includes a computer subroutine for calculating mineral insolubilities as <b>brines</b> <b>cool,</b> a chemical and structural analysis of several actual scale samples and a laboratory experimental program to examine scaling kinetics...|$|R

A pumping equipment is driving brine with an optimal flow range in order to manage heat exchange process and creating enough pumping head to overcome all pressure losses. The maximum pressure drop is expected at the DHE section due to frictional losses associated with exchanger’s length. So, the compact DHE is an advantage.
