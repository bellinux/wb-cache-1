5|$|Traditionally, {{the arrest}} of the bishops {{has been seen as}} a turning point in Stephen's reign, and the event that turned the ecclesiastical {{hierarchy}} against him. Recent historians have held a lively debate on the issue; a few still hold to the traditional interpretation, but most have decided that reactions in the English church were more ambivalent. One modern historian, David Crouch, believes that {{the arrest of}} the bishops signalled the beginnings of the Anarchy, not <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> alienation of the church, but through court politics, where Stephen showed himself incapable of manipulating the factions of his court. The ascendency of the Beaumonts was marked by the placement of one of their protégés, Philip de Harcourt, as Chancellor.|$|E
25|$|In other words, {{according}} to Rousseau, reason, language and rational community did not arise <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> conscious decision or plan by humans or gods, nor <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> pre-existing human nature. As a result, he claimed, living together in rationally organized communities like modern humans is a development with many negative aspects {{compared to the}} original state of man as an ape. If anything is specifically human in this theory, it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans. This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution.|$|E

25|$|Some have {{suggested}} that the notion of eternal return is related to the overman, since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the overman is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or asceticism. Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the overman, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the overman in order to will the eternal recurrence; that is, only the overman will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> choice they made.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the invasion, {{it is clear that the}} Persians held most advantages. Regardless of its actual size, it is clear that the Persians had brought an overwhelming number of troops and ships to Greece. The Persians had a unified command system, and everyone was answerable to the king. They had a hugely efficient bureaucracy, which allowed them to undertake remarkable feats of planning. The Persian generals had significant experience of warfare over the 80 years in which the Persian empire had been established. Furthermore, the Persians excelled in the use of intelligence and diplomacy in warfare, as shown by their (nearly successful) attempts to divide-and-conquer the Greeks. The Greeks, by comparison, were fragmented, with only 30 or so city-states actively opposing the Persian invasion; even those were prone to quarrel with each other. They had little experience of large-scale warfare, being largely restricted to small-scale local warfare, and their commanders were chosen primarily on the basis of the political and social standing, rather than <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> experience or expertise. As Lazenby therefore asks: [...] "So why did the Persians fail?" ...|$|E
500|$|The female lead, Valeria, has her {{roots in}} two strong female {{characters}} from Howard's Conan stories.

[...] Valeria's prowess in battle matches that of Conan, and she is also depicted as his equal in capability and status. [...] The loyalty and love she displays for Conan makes her more than a companion to him; she represents his [...] "possibilities of human happiness". [...] Her sacrifice for Conan and her brief return from death act out the heroic code, illustrating that self-sacrificing heroism brings [...] "undying fame". [...] Valeria's name is not spoken in the film; the only scene where she was named, her self-introduction, was cut.|$|E
500|$|The {{classical}} Kuiper belt {{appears to}} be a composite of two separate populations. The first, known as the [...] "dynamically cold" [...] population, has orbits much like the planets; nearly circular, with an orbital eccentricity of less than 0.1, and with relatively low inclinations up to about 10° (they lie close to the plane of the Solar System rather than at an angle). The cold population also contain a concentration of objects, referred to as the kernel, with semi-major axes at 44–44.5 AU. The second, the [...] "dynamically hot" [...] population, has orbits much more inclined to the ecliptic, by up to 30°. The two populations have been named this way not <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> major difference in temperature, but from analogy to particles in a gas, which increase their relative velocity as they become heated up. Not only are the two populations in different orbits, the cold population also differs in color and albedo, being redder and brighter, has a larger fraction of binary objects, has a different size distribution, and lacks very large objects. The difference in colors may be a reflection of different compositions, which suggests they formed in different regions. The hot population is proposed to have formed near Neptune's original orbit and to have been scattered out during the migration of the giant planets. The cold population, on the other hand, has been proposed to have formed more or less in its current position because the loose binaries would be unlikely to survive encounters with Neptune. Although the Nice model {{appears to be}} able to at least partially explain a compositional difference, it has also been suggested the color difference may reflect differences in surface evolution.|$|E
