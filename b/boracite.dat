But though {{particles}} {{may thus}} be polarized {{in any direction}} {{under the influence of}} powers which are probably of extreme energy (1686.), it does not follow that each particle may not tend to polarize to a greater degree, or with more facility, in one direction than another; or that different kinds may not have specific differences in this respect, as they have differences of conducting and other powers (1296. 1326. 1395.). I sought with great anxiety for a relation of this nature; and selecting crystalline bodies as those in which all the particles are symmetrically placed, and therefore best fitted to indicate any result which might depend upon variation of the direction of the forces to the direction of the particles in which they were developed, experimented very carefully with them. I was the more strongly stimulated to this inquiry by the beautiful electrical condition of the crystalline bodies tourmaline and <b>boracite,</b> and hoped also to discover a relation between electric polarity and that of crystallization, or even of cohesion itself (1316.). My experiments have not established any connexion of the kind sought for. But as I think it of equal importance to show either that there is or is not such a relation, I shall briefly describe the results.|$|E

50|$|<b>Boracite</b> is a {{magnesium}} borate mineral with formula: Mg3B7O13Cl. It {{occurs as}} blue green, colorless, gray, yellow to white crystals in the orthorhombic - pyramidal crystal system. <b>Boracite</b> also shows pseudo-isometric cubical and octahedral forms.

50|$|The {{symmetry}} {{group of}} a crystal net {{will be a}} (group of restrictions of a) crystallographic space group, {{and many of the}} most common crystals are of very high symmetry, i.e., very few orbits. A crystal net is uninodal if it has one orbit of vertex (if the vertices were colored and the symmetries preserve colorings, this would require that a corresponding crystal have atoms of one element or molecular building blocks of one compound - but not vice versa, for it is possible to have a crystal of one element but with several orbits of vertices). Crystals with uninodal crystal nets include cubic diamond and some representations of quartz crystals. Uninodality corresponds with isogonality in geometry and vertex-transitivity in graph theory, and produces examples objective structures. A crystal net is binodal if it has two orbits of vertex; crystals with binodal crystal nets include <b>boracite</b> and anatase. It is edge-transitive or isotoxal if it has one orbit of edges; crystals with edge-transitive crystal nets include <b>boracite</b> but not anatase - which has two orbits of edges.|$|E

40|$|Multiferroics are {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} two and more switchable states, such as polarization, magnetization and strain [1 - 2]. Multiferroic materials are attractive not only due to information storage devices but also for their high electrical permittivity and high magnetic permeability. This property can be used to replace the inductor and capacitor in resonant circuits with a single component, which are further useful in miniaturizing portable cellular technologies. Strong coupling between the polarization and magnetization in multiferroics would allow these materials to be used in multistage data storage devices or switch the magnetic properties with an electric field and vice versa. In general, magnetoelectric phenomenon exhibits coupling between magnetization and electric field or polarization and magnetic field. Induction of polarization (P) by applied magnetic field (H) or vice-versa has been observed long back in 1888 in an experiment carried out by Rongten where dielectric material gets magnetized when placed in an electric field [3]. Later in 1894, Curie recommended the possibility of magnetoelectric effect in some crystals [4]. In 1961, Cr 2 O 3 was recognized as first magnetoelectric material, which has shown magnetoelectric coupling coefficient of the order of 10 - 12 s/m [5]. The first multiferroic material discovered was nickel iodine <b>boracites</b> (Ni 3 B 7 O 13 I) with magnetic ordering below TN (~ 60 K) and ferroelectric one below TC (~ 400 K) [6 - 7].
