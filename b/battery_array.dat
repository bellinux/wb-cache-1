30|$|With {{emerging}} battery {{needs for}} a vast range of applications, including electric vehicles, {{research and development}} of batteries are currently evolving at a swift pace [16, 17]. Large utility-scale batteries using lithium ion technologies have only emerged recently. They consist {{of a large number of}} battery units on racks filling large halls [18]. They are operated similar to pumped hydropower energy storage, storing energy at times of high availability, and feeding it back into the grid at times of high demand [19]. With efficiencies of over 90 % (e.g. [20, 21]), low memory effect and slow aging [22], lithium-ion batteries represent an appropriate choice for large-scale stationary applications [21, 23]. The particular type of lithium-ion technology considered here are lithium–manganese batteries. The fact that lithium-ion batteries can cope well with partial charging cycles makes them well suited for buffering energy requirements in both directions: reducing excesses and feeding into counteract shortfalls in the system [24].

In this paper, we explore how to lower electric bills without requiring consumer involvement using an intelligent charging system, called SmartCharge, and an on-site <b>battery</b> <b>array</b> to store low-cost energy for use during high-cost periods. SmartCharge’s algorithm reduces electricity costs by determining when to switch the home’s power supply between the grid and the <b>battery</b> <b>array.</b> The algorithm leverages a prediction model we develop, which forecasts future demand using statistical machine learning techniques. We evaluate SmartCharge in simulation using data from real homes to quantify its potential to lower bills {{in a range of}} scenarios. We show that typical savings to-day are 10 - 15 %, but increase linearly with rising electricity prices. We also find that SmartCharge deployed at only 22 % of 435 homes reduces the aggregate demand peak by 20 %. Finally, we analyze SmartCharge’s installation and mainte-nance costs. Our analysis shows that battery advancements, combined with an expected rise in electricity prices, have the potential to make the return on investment positive for the average home within the next few years. 1...|$|E

40|$|The use of efficient, {{innovative}} and cost effective renewable energy systems {{in order to}} produce potable water seems to be a very promising research objective for scientists, engineers and economists, since the choice of the appropriate technologies is combined with the fact that these systems should be economically feasible.

40|$|Nanostructures {{are highly}} {{attractive}} for future electrical energy storage devices because they enable {{large surface area}} and short ion transport time through thin electrode layers for high power devices. Significant enhancement in power density of batteries has been achieved by nano-engineered structures, particularly anode and cathode nanostructures spatially separated far apart by a porous membrane and/or a defined electrolyte region. A self-aligned nanostructured battery fully confined within a single nanopore presents a powerful platform to determine the rate performance and cyclability limits of nanostructured storage devices. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has enabled us to create and evaluate such structures, comprised of nanotubular electrodes and electrolyte confined within anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) nanopores. The V 2 O 5 - V 2 O 5 symmetric nanopore battery displays exceptional power-energy performance and cyclability when tested as a massively parallel device (~ 2 billion/cm 2), each with ~ 1 m 3 volume (~ 1 fL). Cycled between 0. 2 V and 1. 8 V, this full cell has capacity retention of 95 % at 5 C rate and 46 % at 150 C, with more than 1000 charge/discharge cycles. These results demonstrate the promise of ultrasmall, self-aligned/regular, densely packed nanobattery structures as a testbed to study ionics and electrodics at the nanoscale with various geometrical modifications and as a building block for high performance energy storage systems[1, 2]. Further increase of full cell output potential is also demonstrated in asymmetric full cell configurations with various low voltage anode materials. The asymmetric full cell nanopore batteries, comprised of V 2 O 5 as cathode and prelithiated SnO 2 or anatase phase TiO 2 as anode, with integrated nanotubular metal current collectors underneath each nanotubular storage electrode, also enabled by ALD. By controlling the amount of lithium ion prelithiated into SnO 2 anode, we can tune full cell output voltage {{in the range of}} 0. 3 V and 3 V. This asymmetric nanopore <b>battery</b> <b>array</b> displays exceptional rate performance and cyclability. When cycled between 1 V and 3 V, it has capacity retention of approximately 73 % at 200 C rate compared to 1 C, with only 2 % capacity loss after more than 500 charge/discharge cycles. With increased full cell output potential, the asymmetric V 2 O 5 -SnO 2 nanopore battery shows significantly improved energy and power density. This configuration presents a more realistic test - through its asymmetric (vs symmetric) configuration – of performance and cyclability in nanoconfined environment. This dissertation covers (1) Ultra small electrochemical storage platform design and fabrication, (2) Electron and ion transport in nanostructured electrodes inside a half cell configuration, (3) Ion transport between anode and cathode in confined nanochannels in symmetric full cells, (4) Scale up energy and power density with geometry optimization and low voltage anode materials in asymmetric full cell configurations.
