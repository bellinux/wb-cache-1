5|$|On March 8, it was {{announced}} that Second Sons pre-order sales had surpassed those of The Last of Us in the United Kingdom. Two special edition versions of the game were produced; pre-ordered and first-run copies of the game received the Limited Edition, which includes the Coles Legacy mission pack that explain story events between Infamous 2 and Second Son. The Collector's Edition includes a unique <b>box</b> <b>cover,</b> a replica of Delsin's beanie, eight pins from his vest, an exclusive in-game vest, and a D.U.P.-themed patch. All pre-ordered copies of the game included four in-game vests for Delsin.|$|E
5|$|Items {{from the}} TV series such as multi-perspective screens (as {{shown on the}} <b>box</b> <b>cover)</b> were popular for {{illustrating}} multiple viewpoints of an objective. The use of episode start and end graphics to mark the start and end of missions was also liked. The script was generally described as being a redeeming feature of the game, although fans of the series may find that the viewpoints, motives and reasoning of the villains isn't covered well. Cutscenes were singled out for particular praise by IGN, highlighting good use of camera angles and tight focus. Voice acting was generally popular, although some lines suffered from poor direction or emphasis. In contrast, device and ambiance sounds were well received with gunfire getting a particular mention.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{gameplay}} is {{as that of}} Ruby and Sapphire, Emerald introduces new features. The plot is modified; both Team Magma and Aqua are villains who {{are locked}} in a constant gang war and awaken Groudon and Kyogre, respectively. When the two legendary Pokémon begin to battle each other, the protagonist must unleash the legendary Pokémon Rayquaza (pictured on the <b>box</b> <b>cover)</b> to calm them. Some of the game mechanics are changed as well. Though double battles were clearly marked in Ruby and Sapphire, in Emerald, two separate trainers might unite to battle as a pair. After the Elite Four is defeated, the player may re-battle Gym Leaders in a double battle if they are called on their PokéNav. Also, Pokémon sprites are animated in battle like they were in Pokémon Crystal. Probably the most significant addition is the Battle Frontier, an expanded version of the Battle Tower in Ruby and Sapphire.|$|E

25|$|The SS service medals were {{manufactured}} by two firms Deschler of Munich and Petz & Lorenz of Unterreichenbach. The medals were die struck {{and had a}} metal composition of different alloys such as bronze, tin, copper and zinc. All levels of the long service awards were held on blue ribbons (See images).

This version includes the original retail version of the game, along with the Spec 2.0 update already installed, plus vouchers for the game's DLC that was released in 2011. This version also has an alternative box art: Instead of the Le Mans Red Mercedes SLS AMG, the same car is now painted silver, and the inside cover features two screenshots of the Red Bull X2011 Race Car (which is featured as DLC, itself being an evolved, faster form of the Red Bull X2010 featured in the game as well), which can be flipped and used as the front <b>box</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E
500|$|Barbarian {{proved to}} be a big hit, and Palace started {{planning}} to publish a line of sequels; Leinfellner said he received royalty cheques for approximately seven years, the first of which was for £20,000. [...] was released in 1988, and Barbarian III was in the works. [...] Van Wijk and Whittaker were hired again to grace the <b>box</b> <b>cover</b> and advertisements. [...] After the success with Barbarian, Palace Software began to expand its portfolio by publishing games that were created by other developers. [...] Barbarian, however, remained its most popular game, best remembered for its violent sword fights and Maria Whittaker.|$|E
500|$|As {{with its}} predecessor, Barbarian II was {{licensed}} to Epyx for release in North America. [...] The game was published there {{under the title}} Axe of Rage and included a tattoo in its packaging. [...] The North American version featured a different cover art, showing the close-up visage of [...] "a screaming berserker with homicidal tendencies". [...] Dragon magazine's reviewers found the cover ugly, and according to Computer Gaming World, a Canadian wholesaler refused to sell Axe of Rage because it considered the game's <b>box</b> <b>cover</b> art crass enough to offend customers. [...] Similarly, in the United Kingdom, pharmacy chain Boots banned displays of Barbarian II, featuring Whittaker, from their stores.|$|E

500|$|Since {{several members}} of the team enjoyed racing games and had also worked on Diddy Kong Racing, they decided to include the futuristic Ant racing {{featured}} in the campaign and the top-down arcade racing games in the multiplayer. Developers initially considered the possibility to use the 4MB Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, but the idea was eventually dropped. According to Mountain, [...] "we wanted to deliver the same experience to all players and were confident that we could do this using the standard 4MB of RAM on the console." [...] This led to some confusion as the <b>box</b> <b>cover</b> for the original release stated that it did support such a feature. Nintendo provided a quick-fix to the mislabeled covers by providing stickers declaring its Rumble Pak compatibility and fixed later printings of the boxes.|$|E
500|$|In a {{continuing}} attempt by Universal Interactive {{to take credit}} for Crash Bandicoot, Naughty Dog was told that it was not [...] "allowed" [...] to go to the first Electronic Entertainment Expo. In addition, there were leaked copies of the temporary <b>box</b> <b>cover</b> and press materials for the Electronic Entertainment Expo, upon which the Naughty Dog logo, in violation of the contract between Naughty Dog and Universal Interactive, was omitted. In response, Jason Rubin drafted and printed 1,000 copies of a document entitled [...] "Naughty Dog, creator and developer of Crash Bandicoot" [...] to hand {{out in front of the}} Crash Bandicoot display at the Electronic Entertainment Expo. Beforehand, Rubin passed out the flyers [...] "for review" [...] to Universal Interactive, angering its president. Crash Bandicoot was first shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo on May 1996 and was met with enthusiastic reactions. The game was released on September 9, 1996. This was followed by its European release on November 8, 1996.|$|E
500|$|When {{the last}} of the Ives {{brothers}} died in 1888, board game titans Charles and George Parker purchased the rights to The Mansion of Happiness. [...] In 1894, Parker Brothers republished The Mansion of Happiness in their new patented box. [...] The game came with a cover on top of a box. The game board was attached {{to the top of the}} box and a drawer was added to the box for the implements and spinner. A teetotum was no longer needed as a metal pointer could be attached to a lithographed card using a pop rivet. The pointer could then spin around to produce a random number. The game board and box top were printed using lithography, making the game look like a work of art. Some of the vice spaces were removed (those depicting women engaged in immoral acts and behaviors), and men were substituted for women in the House of Correction. The game remained in the Parker Brothers catalog for thirty years, displaying the line, [...] "The first board game ever published in America" [...] on its <b>box</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E

500|$|Each of the {{designers}} had {{a somewhat different}} style in their levels: Dailly's levels often had titles containing clues to what to do (such as [...] "It's Hero Time", suggesting that one lemming had {{to be separated from}} the crowd) and generally required the player to perform several actions at once; Gary Timmons's levels were minimalistic, with popular culture references in the titles, and Scott Johnston's (whose mother was the first voice of the lemmings) levels were generally tightly packed. Dailly was also responsible for the [...] "custom" [...] levels based on other Psygnosis and Reflections Interactive Amiga games, such as Shadow of the Beast, Menace, Awesome and Shadow of the Beast II. These [...] "crossover" [...] levels also used music from those games, though in ports these levels have been removed or altered to remove such references. After they developed most of the hard levels, they then created several simple levels either by copying the existing ones or creating new layouts; as Dailly states, [...] "This I believe is where many games fall down today, they do not spend the time making a good learning curve." [...] Timmons is credited with the official drawings of the lemmings, as necessitated by the need of Psygnosis for <b>box</b> <b>cover</b> artwork.|$|E
