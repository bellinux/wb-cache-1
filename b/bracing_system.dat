40|$|Abstract]: This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{continuum}} design domains on the layouts and performance of optimal <b>bracing</b> <b>systems</b> for multistory steel building frameworks under lateral loads using the performance-based optimization (PBO) technique. In the present method, an unbraced steel framework is initially designed for strength using standard steel sections from databases. A continuum structure is then structurally added to the framework to stiffen the framework. Based on system performance criteria, underutilized finite elements are gradually removed from the continuum design domain to obtain optimal <b>bracing</b> <b>systems</b> for the steel framework. The PBO technique is employed to generate optimal <b>bracing</b> <b>systems</b> for 12 -story steel building frameworks braced with different continuum design domains under multiple lateral loads.

40|$|The use {{of steel}} <b>bracing</b> <b>systems</b> for {{upgrading}} seismically insufficient structures is a feasible solution by enhancing the global stiffness {{and strength of}} such structures. Moreover, steel <b>bracing</b> <b>systems</b> have relatively low cost and easy construction phases. For this purpose, several configurations of steel <b>bracing</b> <b>systems</b> can be applied for upgrading the seismic behavior of the structures. The most frequently utilized systems comprise concentrically-braced frames, eccentrically-braced frames, and knee-brace frames [1]. In the last few decades, the seismic behavior and design of new steel structures with knee <b>bracing</b> <b>systems</b> has been studied extensively due to its efficiency as an earthquake resisting system [2 - 8]. Indeed, the structures with knee bracing can be designed to be stiff enough to control structural and nonstructural damage, and ductile enough to prevent sudden collapse. In order to achieve these purposes, the lateral stiffness {{is provided by the}} brace elements and ductility by the knee elements through the formation of plastic behavior for dissipation of the energy under earthquakes. In the current study, apart from the studies in the literature, the effectiveness of using different types of knee <b>bracing</b> <b>systems,</b> such as chevron, cross and diagonal knee <b>bracing</b> <b>systems</b> for enhancing the seismic response of the existing steel moment resisting frame systems were comparatively examined through nonlinear time history analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{researches}} {{have recently}} progressed toward {{the use of}} the superelastic shape memory alloys (SMAs) to develop new smart control systems that reduce permanent deformation occurring due to severe earthquake events and that automatically recover original configuration. The superelastic SMA materials are unique metallic alloys that can return to undeformed shape without additional heat treatments only after the removal of applied loads. Once the superelastic SMA materials are thus installed at the place where large deformations are likely to intensively occur, the structural system can make the best use of recentering capabilities. Therefore, this study is intended to propose new buckling-restrained braced frames (BRBFs) with superelastic SMA <b>bracing</b> <b>systems.</b> In order to verify the performance of such <b>bracing</b> <b>systems,</b> 6 -story <b>braced</b> frame buildings were designed in accordance with the current design specifications and then nonlinear dynamic analyses were performed at 2 D frame model by using seismic hazard ground motions.
