40|$|A sawmill {{operations}} were studied {{to know the}} coefficient of utilization and the dimensional quality of the timber located in the Sierra Sur of Oaxaca, Mexico. This was done during the transformation of pieces of wood in the Pinus spp. at the facilities of the Specialized Unit of Communal Forest Resources, located {{in the village of}} Santa Cruz Itundujia. A total of 101 pieces of wood were analyzed using the Samalian formula; the pieces had varied diametric measures, length of 2. 63 m, and a volume of 63. 37 and 58. 35 m 3, with and without bark. To determine the efficiency of sawed wood, the pieces of wood were classified in groups of eight diametric categories andÂ seven of conical shape. The study of time and movement included analysis of observations per sampling in intervals of two minutes to the three principal sections of the sawmill (saw, edge <b>banding</b> <b>machine,</b> and circular saw). When the pieces of wood were processed, 1875 planks were generated with a 19. 05 mm of thickness; the production was evaluated in third and fourth class which was located with the decimal metric system, symbolizing 30. 12 m 3 of sawed wood. The coefficient of progress rate was 44. 18 % with and without bark, indicating that from every 1 m 3 r without bark, 216 of sawed wood is processed and to obtain 1000 pt, 4. 62 meters m 3 r of woodrollsare is required. The study of time and movements showed that the main saw obtains a work time of 70. 63 %, the edge-banding machine 54. 21 %, and the circular saw 26. 02 %...|$|E
