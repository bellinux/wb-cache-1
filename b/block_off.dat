5|$|In Philadelphia itself, the {{combination}} of snow and sleet closed many of the schools, delayed flights, trains and buses. The school district parochial schools were closed on the 14th, as were the regional and central administrative offices. During the midday hours on the 14th, giant slabs of ice slid off tops of buildings in Center City and crashed to the ground. Chunks of ice as large as three feet wide {{made their way to}} the pavement from high up. Police started to <b>block</b> <b>off</b> areas where the ice was falling, however one man was hit in the head by the falling ice and was knocked to the ground.|$|E

25|$|A {{privately owned}} and {{operated}} building, 1237 West, was built one <b>block</b> <b>off</b> campus as a student apartment community for over 580 DePaul University students with retail businesses on the first floor. DePaul was one of seven finalists for “College of the Year” honors given by Time magazine and the Princeton Review in 1998. DePaul got the #1 ranking for Great College Town by the Princeton Review in 2008.|$|E
25|$|A door is {{a moving}} {{mechanism}} used to <b>block</b> <b>off,</b> and allow access to, an entrance to or within an enclosed space, {{such as a}} building, room or vehicle. Doors normally consist {{of one or two}} solid panels, with or without windows, that swing on hinges horizontally. These hinges are attached to the door's edge but there are also doors that slide, fold or spin. The main purpose of a door is to control physical access.|$|E
25|$|The Wendover Arm {{itself had}} a working life of 100 years. Part of its {{downfall}} {{was that some}} sections leaked. Much of it was repuddled within 10 years of its construction, {{to try to prevent}} some of the leakage. There is speculation that a section called The Narrows was lined with concrete and faced with bricks to prevent leakage into a large neighbouring property, Aston Clinton House, but this is unconfirmed. The company tried using asphalt to line the canal in 1857, but that failed after 13 years, due in part to inexperience {{in the use of the}} material. In 1897, which was drier than usual, the Grand Union company decided that the arm was leaking more water than it was supplying, and stop planks were used to <b>block</b> <b>off</b> the arm at Little Tring. The stop planks were replaced by a stop lock, which was operational by 1901.|$|E

25|$|In 1768 John Golborne {{advised the}} {{narrowing}} {{of the river}} and the increasing of the scour by the construction of rubble jetties and the dredging of sandbanks and shoals. A particular problem was the division of the river into two shallow channels by the Dumbuck shoal near Dumbarton. After James Watt's report on this in 1769, a jetty was constructed at Longhaugh Point to <b>block</b> <b>off</b> the southern channel. This being insufficient, a training wall called the Lang Dyke was built in 1773 on the Dumbuck shoal to stop water flowing over into the southern channel. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries hundreds of jetties were built out from the banks between Dumbuck and the Broomielaw quay in Glasgow itself. In some cases this resulted in an immediate deepening as the constrained water flow washed away the river bottom; in others, dredging was required.|$|E
25|$|Next, Surrey {{moved to}} <b>block</b> <b>off</b> the Scots' route north and so James {{was forced to}} move his army and {{artillery}} two miles to Branxton Hill. The Scottish artillery, as described by an English source, included five great curtals, two great culverins, four sakers, and six great serpentines. The King's secretary, Patrick Paniter {{was in charge of}} these cannon. When the armies were within three miles of each other Surrey sent the Rouge Croix pursuivant to James, who answered that he would wait till noon. At 11 o'clock, Thomas, Lord Howard's vanguard and artillery crossed the Twizel Bridge. (Pitscottie says the King would not allow the Scots artillery to fire on the vulnerable English during this manoeuvre.) The Scots army was in good order in five formations, after the Almain (German) manner. On Friday afternoon the Scots host descended without speaking any word to meet the English.|$|E
25|$|MARTA {{has had two}} fatal {{accidents}} {{which resulted}} in a formal investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. On February 25, 2000 a train near Avondale station struck two automatic train control technicians who were inspecting a relay box; one was fatally injured and the other technician suffered serious injuries. The workers had failed to apply for a safe clearance restriction for the track work. In addition, the rail system center controller, who was aware of the workers, failed to notify train drivers of the technicians' presence. A second accident occurred on April 10, 2000 when a train struck a bucket lift containing two contract workers at Lenox station; the workers were fatally injured. Although the MARTA employee who was accompanying the workers notified the rail control center of the work over the track, the control center employee failed to <b>block</b> <b>off</b> the section of the track in the automated rail control system and also failed to notify the unscheduled southbound train of the workers' presence. In 2001 MARTA settled with the families of the two killed workers for US$10.5million.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} precaution {{is to remove}} and reduce trash and rubbish from your property, such as woodpiles, boxes, plywood, tires, and trash cans—especially if they are stored {{right next to the}} house. With attached garages, <b>block</b> <b>off</b> house access by sealing cracks around doors and access holes for electrical conduits or plumbing. In the Midwest, some brown recluse bites occur when a sleeping person rolls over during the night, and the trapped spider bites. In the bedroom, move the bed away from the wall, remove any skirts or ruffles and remove all items stored under it. This minimizes chances that any spider can crawl onto the bed. Do not leave clothes and shoes on the floor, or shake them before dressing if they are left out. Apparel and equipment that is only occasionally worn should be stored in tightly closed plastic bags, especially if stored in the garage or other dark storage areas. Typically, pesticide control of spiders is difficult. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control. However, spiders' perched legs allow them to walk over most pesticides, making the use of chemicals to eradicate the spiders impractical and unnecessarily toxic. A 2014 study indicates that fumigation may be more effective than previously believed. Sticky traps placed along floor boards offer a non-insecticidal way to trap spiders as well as provide an idea of population levels in the structure.|$|E
500|$|The vast {{majority}} of the collection is dated between 1910 and 1940. Few items exist from before her marriage, when she started shopping [...] "almost every afternoon", nor from after the outbreak of World War II, when she appears to have taken on a [...] "make do and mend" [...] attitude, which remained until her death. The size of the collection caused strain between Emily and her husband, along with storage difficulties. The clothes were stored in tea chests and could be found in the couple's en-suite bathroom, the servants' quarters, and were even used to <b>block</b> <b>off</b> part of the cellar to secure other valuables.|$|E
500|$|The American plan {{relied on}} {{launching}} coordinated attacks from three directions. General John Cadwalader would launch a diversionary {{attack against the}} British garrison at Bordentown, New Jersey, to <b>block</b> <b>off</b> reinforcements from the south. General James Ewing would take 700 militia across the river at Trenton Ferry, seize the bridge over the Assunpink Creek and prevent enemy troops from escaping. The main assault force of 2,400 men would cross the river [...] north of Trenton and split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to launch a pre-dawn attack. Sullivan would attack the town from the south, and Greene from the north. Depending {{on the success of}} the operation, the Americans would possibly follow up with separate attacks on Princeton and New Brunswick.|$|E

500|$|On Queen Street, all Hessian {{attempts}} to advance {{up the street}} were repulsed by guns {{under the command of}} Thomas Forrest. [...] After firing four rounds each, two more Hessian guns were silenced. [...] One of Forrest's Howitzers was put out of action with a broken axle. [...] The Knyphausen Regiment became separated from the Lossberg and the Rall regiments. The Lossberg and the Rall fell back to a field outside town, taking heavy losses from grapeshot and musket fire. In {{the southern part of the}} town, Americans under command of Sullivan began to overwhelm the Hessians. [...] John Stark led a bayonet charge at the Knyphausen regiment, whose resistance broke because their weapons would not fire. [...] Sullivan led a column of men to <b>block</b> <b>off</b> escape of troops across the creek.|$|E
500|$|The lodge's {{structure}} {{made it a}} stronghold. [...] The lodge, {{named after}} nearby Mount Asama, was a three-story wood and concrete edifice built {{into the side of}} the hill atop an exposed base of steel-reinforced concrete. [...] The upper floor was slightly larger than the two below, giving the lodge a mushroom appearance. [...] The building towered over the steep, snow-covered slopes below and the lodge's windows had heavy outer storm shutters. The building's maze-like floor plan and narrow staircases made it easy for the defenders to <b>block</b> <b>off</b> movement inside the building. [...] The radicals would spend most of their time on the uppermost floor, which contained a kitchen, dining room, tatami-mat sleeping room, and a commanding view of the surrounding valley and hills. The radicals placed large pieces of furniture and futon bedding around the doors and windows and secured them in place with wire. [...] When Muta's husband returned and saw the barricades he realized what had happened and quickly notified police. [...] The police immediately set up roadblocks and surrounded the lodge to cut off any avenues of escape for the radicals inside.|$|E
