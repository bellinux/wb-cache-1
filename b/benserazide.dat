40|$|Binding {{of drugs}} to plasma {{proteins}} {{is an important}} determinant for their efficacy because it modulates drug availability to the intended target. Co-administered drugs may bind to the same protein site or to different functionally linked clefts following competitive and allosteric mechanisms. Here, we report a thermodynamic and computational characterization of the binding mode of apomorphine and <b>benserazide,</b> two therapeutic agents co-administered {{in the treatment of}} Parkinson's disease, to human serum albumin (HSA). Apomorphine binds to HSA with a simple equilibrium (K(d) = 3. 1 x 10 (- 6) M). Conversely, <b>benserazide</b> binds to HSA with two independent equilibria (K(d 1) < or = 10 (- 6) M and K(d 2) = 5. 0 x 10 (- 5) M). Values of K(d) and K(d 2) increase to 1. 5 x 10 (- 5) M and 5. 0 x 10 (- 4) M, respectively, in the presence of heme. Accordingly, the K(d) value for heme binding to HSA increases from 5. 0 x 10 (- 7) M to 4. 8 x 10 (- 6) M and 9. 2 x 10 (- 7) M, in the presence of saturating amounts of apomorphine and <b>benserazide,</b> respectively. The K(d 1) value for <b>benserazide</b> binding to HSA is not affected by heme binding, whereas apomorphine and <b>benserazide</b> inhibit warfarin binding to HSA, and vice versa. Therefore, apomorphine and the second <b>benserazide</b> molecule bind to the warfarin site, allosterically linked to the heme site. Simulated docking of apomorphine and <b>benserazide</b> into the warfarin site provides favorable values of intermolecular energy (- 23. 0 kJ mol(- 1) and - 15. 2 kJ mol(- 1), respectively). Considering the apomorphine, <b>benserazide,</b> and HSA-heme plasma levels and the possible co-administration of warfarin, these results appear relevant in the management of patients affected by Parkinson's disease...|$|E

Results: Treatment of rats with LD and <b>benserazide</b> significantly increased total homocysteine in plasma of the LD/Ben group when compared to the other groups. Lipid peroxidation of cerebellum increased significantly in LD-treated rats when compared to the other groups.

Studies were performed at 5 – 7 days post lesion (group 1 animals), at 21 days (group 2) when denervation supersensitivity was evident by contralateral turning to apomorphine {{and at the same}} time but following 7 days dosing with LDME plus <b>benserazide</b> (group 3). In unlesioned animals, LDME alone inhibited spontaneous firing by some 45 % over 60 [*]min including a marked but transient early phase which was still present in all lesioned animals even though the later inhibition was significantly reduced in group 1 and 3 animals. When given after <b>benserazide</b> in unlesioned animals LDME still produced a similar level of overall inhibition but without the early phase. The lesion reduced the overall inhibition, except in group 2 animals, and after chronic dosing (group 3) it was almost absent. It is proposed that since the early inhibition with LDME alone is still seen after lesion of the nigrostriatal tract but not after the PDI <b>benserazide,</b> it is caused by peripherally formed dopamine and that as the delayed inhibition with LDME alone and after <b>benserazide</b> are all reduced by nigrostriatal lesions, as is its amphetamine like ipsilateral turning, that this depends on locally (striatal) synthesized dopamine. This study also shows that chronic levodopa/PDI treatment reduces the compensating increased activity of surviving dopaminergic neurones and the functional supersensitivity to dopamine suggests that the long term administration of levodopa may reduce its own utilization and activity in the striatum and in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease...|$|E

However, long-term levodopa replacement therapy is accompanied by abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs), known as levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). Until now, the precise mechanisms of LID were only partially understood. Previous studies have shown that continuous dopamine stimulation was helpful in reducing the expression of LID. In addition to dopamine D 1 receptor, glutamatergic receptors such as &alpha;-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor also contribute to the expression of LID. The current authors have previously reported that levodopa/benserazide-loaded microspheres could ameliorate the expression of LID by reducing the protein kinase A signaling pathway in dyskinetic rats. However, whether AMPA receptor is involved in the mechanism by which levodopa/benserazide-loaded microspheres ameliorate the expression of LID in dyskinetic rats was unknown. Methods: In the present study, as reported previously, levodopa and <b>benserazide</b> were loaded by poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres, which can release levodopa and <b>benserazide</b> in a sustained manner. 6 -Hydroxydopamine was injected into the right medial forebrain bundle to produce a rat model of PD. Then valid PD rats were treated with levodopa plus <b>benserazide</b> for 3 weeks to induce a rat model of LID. Dyskinetic rats were treated with levodopa/beserazide-loaded microspheres containing levodopa (6 mg/kg) plus <b>benserazide</b> (15 mg/kg) or same dose of levodopa plus <b>benserazide.</b> Abnormal involuntary movements were measured in rats on days 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 during the treatment. The levels of GluR 1 at serine- 831 (pGluR 1 S 831) and serine- 845 (pGluR 1 S 845) were determined by Western blot. Arc and proenkephalin (Penk) levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Three-week levodopa plus <b>benserazide</b> treatment induced dyskinesia in PD rats. Levodopa/benserazide-loaded microsphere-treated dyskinetic rats showed lower AIM scores than levodopa plus benserazide-treated dyskinetic rats. Microsphere treatment downregulated the phosphrylated levels of pGluR 1 S 831 and pGluR 1 S 845 in the striatum of dyskinetic rats. In addition, microsphere treatment reduced the levels of Arc and Penk.

40|$|Background: Not all {{patients}} with Parkinson's disease (PD) respond to levodopa and others develop dyskinesias.

Objective: To examine {{the economic impact of}} reducing dyskinesias using ropinirole instead of levodopa plus <b>benserazide</b> in PD was examined. The research question addressed was: is the added cost of ropinirole offset by savings due to avoided cases of dyskinesia? Methods: A cost-minimisation analysis was performed from both the societal and Ministry of Health (MoH) of Ontario, Canada perspectives, using 5 -year data from a study of dyskinesia outcomes comparing ropinirole with levodopa plus <b>benserazide.</b> A predictive model was developed to capture resource utilisation over 5 years, such as medication costs, medical consultations, hospital admissions, nursing home admissions, caregiver time and productivity loss. The model was based on a previously reported clinical trial which determined dyskinesia rates to be 20 % for ropinirole and 45 % for levodopa. Standard costing lists were used, and costs were discounted at various rates. Constant 1999 Canadian dollars ($Can) were applied, and no increases were assumed over the time horizon of the analysis. A multivariate sensitivity analysis with changes in key parameters was also performed. Results: From a societal perspective, ropinirole was cost saving. From the MoH perspective, the analysis yielded an incremental expected daily cost/patient of $Can 4. 41 for substituting levodopa plus <b>benserazide</b> with ropinirole. Ropinirole resulted in daily savings/patient of $Can 0. 17 in non-drug healthcare costs.

40|$|Renal {{proximal}} tubular {{cells have}} been shown to express aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (L-AAAD), which converts L-dopa into dopamine and 5 -hydroxytryptophan [(OH) Trp] into 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT; serotonin). Because 5 -HT receptors have been demonstrated in proximal cells, we hypothesized that 5 -HT may act as an autocrine/paracrine modulator of proximal transport. We evaluated this possibility in opossum kidney (OK) cells, a renal epithelial cell line with a proximal phenotype expressing 5 -HT 1 B receptors, and in intact anaesthetized rats. 5 -HT synthesis by OK cells increased with incubation time and (OH) Trp concentration, and was abolished by <b>benserazide,</b> an L-AAAD inhibitor. 5 -HT reversed parathyroid hormone (PTH) -induced cAMP accumulation in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner and reduced the PTH inhibition of P(i) uptake without affecting the NaP(i) - 4 mRNA level. The effects of 5 -HT on cAMP generation and Na-P(i) co-transport were reproduced by (OH) Trp, except in the presence of <b>benserazide,</b> and by L-propranolol and dihydroergotamine, two 5 -HT 1 B receptor agonists. In rats, (OH) Trp and dihydroergotamine decreased fractional P(i) excretion. <b>Benserazide</b> abolished the effect of (OH) Trp but not that of dihydroergotamine. In conclusion: (i) locally generated 5 -HT blunts the inhibitory effect of PTH on Na-P(i) co-transport in OK cells; (ii) endogenous 5 -HT decreases P(i) excretion in rats; and (iii) 5 -HT is a paracrine modulator involved in the physiological regulation of renal P(i) transport...|$|E
