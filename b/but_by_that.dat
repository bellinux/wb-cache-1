5|$|Abdül Kadir was {{the first}} Ottoman pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} to be constructed. She was laid down in 1892 {{at the beginning of}} a small-scale expansion of the Ottoman Navy. Work slowed down considerably once she was framed. By the early 1900s the only progress that had been made was the addition of armor plating around her keel. Once that was finished, work ceased. Construction was planned to resume in 1904 <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> time her keel blocks, which were used to prevent hogging and sagging, had shifted and the ship was considered a total loss. She was scrapped on the slipway in 1914. A model of this ship exists in the Constantinople Naval Museum.|$|E
5|$|Boone {{served as}} syndic and commandant until 1804, when Missouri {{became part of}} the United States {{following}} the Louisiana Purchase. Because Boone's land grants from the Spanish government had been largely based on verbal agreements, he once again lost his land claims. In 1809, he petitioned Congress to restore his Spanish land claims, which was finally done in 1814. Boone sold most of this land to repay old Kentucky debts. When the War of 1812 came to Missouri, Boone's sons Daniel Morgan Boone and Nathan Boone took part, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> time Boone was much too old for militia duty.|$|E
5|$|By 16:00 the 1st Light Horse Brigade had {{captured}} No. 2 redoubt, and Chaytor reported capturing buildings and redoubts on the left. After {{a telephone call}} between Chauvel and Chetwode, pressure continued to be exerted and an attack by all units took place at 16:30. The Ottoman garrison held on until the dismounted attackers were within , <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> time, {{there was no doubt}} that the Ottoman garrison was losing the fight, and they began to surrender in small groups. All organised resistance ceased ten minutes later and as darkness fell, sporadic firing petered out, while prisoners were rounded up, horses collected and watered at the captured wells. Then Chauvel rode into Magdhaba and gave the order to clear the battlefield.|$|E

5|$|By 1942, M3 GMCs {{were being}} used by tank {{destroyer}} battalions in the North African Campaign, each of which consisted of 36 M3s and four 37mm M6 GMCs. The M3 GMCs, which were designed for ambushing tanks, proved to be inadequate for this task in the battles of Sidi Bou Zid and Kasserine Pass, mainly due to poor tactics. Nevertheless, the M3 was later used in the Battle of El Guettar with success, claiming 30 German tanks, including possibly two Tiger tanks, {{at the cost of}} 21 M3s. Some M3s also saw service in Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky), <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> time, the M10 tank destroyer had replaced it in the U.S. Army. A total of 1,360 M3 GMCs were also converted back into M3A1 half-tracks.|$|E
5|$|By nightfall on 18 August, the North Korean 4th Division {{had been}} annihilated; {{huge numbers of}} deserters had {{weakened}} its numbers during the fight, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> time, Obong-ni and Cloverleaf Hill had been retaken by the U.S. forces. Scattered groups of North Korean soldiers fled back across the Naktong, pursued by American planes and artillery fire. The next day, the remains of 4th Division had withdrawn across the river. In their hasty retreat, they left {{a large number of}} artillery pieces and equipment behind which the Americans later pressed into service.|$|E
5|$|From about 1790 {{textiles}} {{became the}} most important industry in the west of Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving of cotton, which flourished until in 1861 the American Civil War cut off the supplies of raw cotton. The industry never recovered, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> time Scotland had developed heavy industries based on its coal and iron resources. The invention of the hot blast for smelting iron (1828) revolutionised the Scottish iron industry. As a result, Scotland became a centre for engineering, shipbuilding {{and the production of}} locomotives. Toward the end of the 19th century, steel production largely replaced iron production.|$|E

5|$|If {{this were}} not enough, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} that simple radar reflectors could be launched along with the warhead that would be indistinguishable to Zeus' radars. This problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned Zeus' inability to discriminate targets. If the decoys spread apart further than the lethal radius of the Zeus' warhead, several interceptors {{will be required to}} guarantee that the warhead hiding among the decoys will be destroyed. Decoys are lightweight, and would slow down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered. <b>But</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> time it would be so close to the Zeus base that there might not be time for the Zeus to climb to altitude.|$|E
5|$|Several {{rumors and}} misconceptions {{have grown up}} around the film, one being that Ronald Reagan was {{originally}} chosen to play Rick. This originated in a press release issued by the studio {{early on in the}} film's development, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> time the studio already knew that he was going into the Army, and he was never seriously considered. George Raft claimed that he had turned down the lead role. Studio records make clear that Wallis was committed to Bogart from the start.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{initially}} had a garrison {{of eight}} gunners, five soldiers and a lieutenant, {{under the command}} of a captain. In the late 1540s, it was heavily armed {{by the standards of the}} time, with 36 pieces of artillery. In the 1580s, the castle caught fire and the timber needed for the repairs required 127 trees to be sent from the New Forest. The work was carried out in 1584, prompted by the threat of a Spanish invasion, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> time its garrison had shrunk to eight men.|$|E

The announcement was made earlier than planned to forestall the possibility of similar events with that discovery, when the MPC told them that their observational data was publicly accessible, and they realized that not only Haumea data <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> time their Eris data had been publicly accessed.

5|$|Virginia {{made some}} {{attempts}} {{to phase out}} slavery, and manumissions had increased {{in the first two}} decades after the war. Thomas Jefferson Randolph gained passage of an 1832 resolution for gradual abolition in the state, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> time, increased demand from development in the Deep South created a large internal market for slavery. The invention of the cotton gin in the late-eighteenth century had enabled the profitable cultivation of short-staple cotton in the uplands, which was widely used.|$|E
5|$|According to Air Chief Marshal Sir Patrick Hine, Hawker's {{interest}} {{may have}} also been stimulated {{by the presence of}} Air Staff Requirement 345, which sought a V/STOL ground attack fighter for the Royal Air Force (RAF). Aviation author Francis K. Mason expressed a contrary view, stating that Hawker's decision to proceed was independent of British government initiatives, and that the P.1127 project was primarily based upon the NATO requirement instead. Hawker had a keen ally in its development in the form of Bristol, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> point the latter was experiencing financial difficulties, and the lack of foreseeable commercial applications for the Pegasus engine in particular, coupled with refusals from HM Treasury, mean that development would have to be financed by NATO institutions instead. The close cooperation between Hawker and Bristol was viewed by project engineer Gordon Lewis as a key factors which had enabled the P.1127's development to proceed in spite of technical obstacles and political setbacks.|$|E

5|$|In Hawaii, Blaine {{worked to}} bind the kingdom {{more closely to}} the United States and to avoid its {{becoming}} a British protectorate. When the McKinley Tariff of 1890 eliminated the duty on sugar, Hawaiian sugar-growers looked {{for a way to}} retain their once-exclusive access to the American market. The Hawaiian minister to the United States, Henry A. P. Carter, tried to arrange for Hawaii have complete trade reciprocity with the United States, but Blaine proposed instead that Hawaii become an American protectorate; Carter favored the idea, but the Hawaiian king, Kalākaua, rejected the infringement on his sovereignty. Blaine next procured the appointment of his former newspaper colleague John L. Stevens as minister to Hawaii. Stevens had long believed that the United States should annex Hawaii, and as minister he co-operated with Americans living in Hawaii in their efforts to bring about annexation. Their efforts ultimately culminated in a coup d'état against Kalākaua’s successor, Liliuokalani, in 1893. Blaine’s precise involvement is undocumented, but the results of Stevens’ diplomacy were in accord with his ambitions for American power in the region. The new government petitioned the United States for annexation, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> time Blaine was no longer in office.|$|E
5|$|Singh {{enrolled}} in the British Indian Army on 20 May 1936, and {{was assigned to the}} 1st Punjab Regiment. Between 1940 and 1945, he served on the North-West Frontier and as an instructor, before deploying to Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. After independence, he took part in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, serving with the Indian Army's 6th Rajputana Rifles. During the battle, Singh was part of the leading section of a company that was assigned to capture a Pakistani post at Tithwal, in Jammu and Kashmir. Soon after their attack was launched, the company suffered heavy casualties. In time, Singh successfully occupied a Pakistani medium machine-gun post. <b>But,</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> time, the entire company lay dead or wounded. Singh was left alone to achieve the objective. He moved out and lobbed grenades at the next enemy post. Before moving to another trench, he received a mortal bullet wound to the head.|$|E

His season proceeded successfully– a new two-year contract had been discussed, and he finished as runner-up for the club's Player of the Year award– until with two games remaining he damaged his anterior cruciate ligament and was expected to be out for several months. Northampton were prepared to give him a six-month contract, albeit on reduced wages, to allow him time to recover and prove his fitness. Birmingham City allowed him to use their facilities for his rehabilitation, and he recovered sufficiently to play a couple of reserve games for Northampton, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> time new manager Colin Calderwood had other players in Gill's position and he was not offered another contract.|$|E

5|$|The {{resistance}} came to {{a climax}} in 1794. In May of that year, federal district attorney William Rawle issued subpoenas for more than 60 distillers in Pennsylvania who had not paid the excise tax. Under the law then in effect, distillers who received these writs would be obligated to travel to Philadelphia to appear in federal court. For farmers on the western frontier, such a journey was expensive, time-consuming, and beyond their means. At the urging of William Findley, Congress modified this law on June 5, 1794, allowing excise trials {{to be held in}} local state courts. <b>But</b> <b>by</b> <b>that</b> time, U.S. marshal David Lenox had already been sent to serve the writs summoning delinquent distillers to Philadelphia. Attorney General William Bradford later maintained that the writs were meant to compel compliance with the law, and that the government did not actually intend to hold trials in Philadelphia.|$|E
