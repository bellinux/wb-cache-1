500|$|Scott {{chose to}} direct American Gangster {{based on the}} {{paradoxical}} values of Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts. The film somewhat focuses on the comparatively ethical business practices of the [...] "wicked gangster" [...] and the womanizing and failed marriage of the [...] "do-gooder" [...] police detective. Washington, who was not normally a fan of gangster films, chose to portray Lucas when he saw [...] "the arc of the character" [...] had ended with prices that Lucas paid for his actions. To prepare for their roles, the actors met their real-life counterparts. Washington acquired Lucas's Southern accent, and Crowe practiced to match Roberts's manner of speaking and body language, requesting tape recordings of Roberts to assist in his preparation. The following March, the studio rehired Zaillian to rewrite the script for American Gangster. It was rumored that Washington got paid another $20million for when the project was greenlit again; that rumor proved to be false, as he signed on for his gross. The budget had escalated to $100 million, which Grazer stated was unexpected given [...] "It's not a high-concept comedy, it's not a fantasy movie, it's not a four-quadrant movie". Grazer and Scott still had {{to pay back the}} studio $3 million for a <b>budget</b> <b>overrun.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate into causes of <b>budget</b> <b>overruns</b> in execution of audit assignments and to make relevant suggestions to mitigate them. Questionnaries and interviews were used as data collection instruments necessary for collection of data. Primary and Secondary sources were both used to obtain data. The Secondary sources used by the researcher included the use of text books, internet sources and Journals. The use of literature as well as the findings obtained from data collected revealed that <b>budget</b> <b>overruns</b> were as result of boththe audit firm and the clients. The research revealed that the audit firm and their related Clients both contributed to <b>budget</b> <b>overruns</b> in some ways. It highlighted on how the clients affected the auditorâ€™s ability to complete audit assignments on time resulting in <b>budget</b> <b>overruns.</b> The use of tables, pie charts and graphs were used to display data for analysis. The data and information obtained indicated that <b>budget</b> <b>overruns</b> has some significant effects or impacts on the audit firm and its clients. This dissertation outlined the factors considered in preparing audit time budgets before the commencement of any audit work as well as their importance in the auditing field. It also examined the importance of audit procedures in improving audit efficiency as well as how they may be of use in the auditing field. The research also looked on how staffing issues in terms of numbers and experience could {{have an impact on the}} audit duration...|$|R

40|$|RESEARCH PROBLEM: Researchers {{have found}} mixed {{evidence}} of how the level of competition affects bids in auctions. According to conventional economic theory, an increase in competition should make bids more competitive. However, the winner's curse phenomenon calls for less aggressive bids in common-value auctions. Bidders may become less aggressive also due to the entry effect, since {{an increase in the}} number of potential bidders decreases the likelihood of winning the contract, yet participation costs remain constant. Rational bidders should take this into account by bidding less aggressively. Which of the effect dominates differs between different types of auctions. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: In this thesis, was empirically studied using Finnish data, how the level of competition affects bids in auctions for public construction projects. Moreover, the relation between bid prices and <b>budget</b> <b>overruns</b> was also studied. The data for studying the effect of competition on bid prices contained information of 496 auctions of various kinds of projects, whereas the data for studying <b>budget</b> <b>overruns</b> contained information of 183 auctions. The data was analyzed using statistical methods such as multivariate regression analysis. The competitiveness of bids was measured as the relation between the pre-bid cost estimation and the lowest bid. <b>Budget</b> <b>overruns</b> were measured as the difference between the final cost of the contract and the lowest bid relative to the lowest bid. If the final cost of the project was not available, the relative amount of change orders and extra works was used as a proxy for <b>budget</b> <b>overruns.</b> FINDINGS: Per each additional bid received, the lowest bid decreases significantly when compared with the pre-bid cost estimation. However, the winner's curse and the entry effect significantly impact bids upward. Two solutions were provided: the release of information about the pre-bid cost estimation and the use of the second-price sealed-bid auction method. An economic downturn was found to be associated with the higher number of bids, lower bid volatility and more competitive bids. The timing of procurement is therefore important. Larger contracts were found to be associated with more accurate pre-bid cost estimations. The costs of small contracts are estimated roughly, but conservatively to avoid <b>budget</b> <b>overruns.</b> Bids were moreover found to be negatively correlated with <b>budget</b> <b>overruns...</b>|$|R

As of 2016, however, both projects were stalled; the suburban rail service to the city (to be operated by CPTM, the São Paulo state commuter railway company) is scheduled to start operations in 2019, with a BRL 101 million <b>budget</b> <b>overrun.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The first Vice-Regal country {{residence}} {{was built}} at Government Farm, Belair in 1860.

He was instrumental in securing government expenditure, and also personally oversaw the selection of a site and directed the design process.
