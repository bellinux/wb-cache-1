40|$|The authors {{estimated}} in 1, 000 women {{the length of}} gestation using two criteria, {{the date of the}} last menstruation and the results of ultrasonic examination (ovarian sac and <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameters).</b> The women were allocated to one of four groups according to the details of their menstrual history: last periods specified precisely, 28 ± 5 days; last periods specified precisely, with longer or shorter cycles; last periods doubtful, or last periods unknown. An additional subdivision was made according to the fetal age {{at the time of the}} estimation. Statistical analysis showed that the average length of pregnancy measured by ultrasound was similar in all groups and series. Only the standard deviation increased slightly towards the end of pregnancy. The results were similar to those obtained by estimating the length of gestation from the date of ovulation.

40|$|Since {{the very}} start of using {{ultrasound}} to monitor pregnancy the information that the obstetrician has obtained from it has been great. Measuring the fetus (<b>biparietal</b> <b>diameters,</b> rump-crown length, etc.) {{makes it possible to}} check development of the fetus in the uterus, as well as to see the various organs and their position and internal structure. Real time pictures make it possible to visualise the organs precisely {{from the point of view}} of their position and their internal structures. We report 12 cases of malformations of the central nervous system which were diagnosed in utero and we point out the value of early diagnosis in pregnancy. The 12 cases we found included four of hydrocephaly, one cyst of the choroid plexus, one hydrencephaly, two cases of holoprosencephaly and four cases of anencephaly. Since these malformations may be part of generalised malformations it is important to search for them by ultrasound as well as by caryotyping and estimation of alpha-fetoprotein levels.

40|$|Background: Abdominal {{circumference}} (AC), <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameters</b> (BPD) and femoral length (FL) are now {{the main}} parameters used to obtain estimated fetal weight (EFW). Although the role of soft tissue parameters in determining fetal weight was proved but clinical attention to mid-thigh soft tissue thickness (STT) is limited. Objective: To find the impression of STT on birth weight (BW) and represent a new predictive formula. Materials and Methods: One hundred and fourteen normal singleton term (36 - 42 w) pregnancies with delivery within 72 hours were randomly selected {{to participate in this}} prospective cohort study. Variables measured by ultrasonography before birth included: AC, BPD, FL and STT. The actual neonatal BW was also measured after birth. Linear regression model was used and R square and p-value were reported. Results: The mean (SD) of BW was 3406 (405) gr. R square was best fit for the model that STT was added to AC, BPD, FL (r 2 : 0. 77). R square for the model using BPD, AC, FL and model using BPD, STT, FL was the same (r 2 : 0. 7). Best fit formula was Log (BW) = 2. 461 + 0. 003 BPD+ 0. 001 AC+ 0. 007 STT+ 0. 005 FL. AC (R: 0. 67, p< 0. 001), STT (R: 0. 50, p< 0. 001), BPD (R: 0. 59, p< 0. 001), FL (R: 0. 66, p< 0. 001) were significantly correlated with birth weight. AC had also significant correlation with STT (p= 0. 001) Conclusion: This study showed adding STT to other variables in predictive models of fetal weight would provide a nice estimation (r 2 = 0. 77) and in cases that measuring AC is suboptimal STT may be a good replacement...|$|R

50|$|Head {{entrapment}} {{is caused}} by the failure of the fetal head to negotiate the maternal midpelvis.

If the baby is preterm, it may be possible for the baby’s body to emerge while the cervix has not dilated enough for the head to emerge.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} reproducibility, {{throughout}} gestation, {{of the two}} most commonly used methods to measure fetal head (HC) and abdominal (AC) circumferences, namely fitting of an “ellipse” and measuring “two diameters”. Methods: Women participating in the INTERGROWTH- 21 st Project had serial ultrasound scans every 5 [*]±[*] 1 weeks from 9 - 14 weeks of gestation until delivery. At each visit, HC and AC were measured in triplicate in two ways: using the ellipse facility (HCellipse and ACellipse) and by measuring two perpendicular <b>diameters</b> (<b>biparietal</b> and occipitofrontal <b>diameter</b> of the head, and transverse and antero-posterior diameters of the abdomen), to calculate HCcalc and ACcalc, respectively. To assess the intra-observer reproducibility, the standard deviation (SD) for each of the triplicate measurements was compared between the two methods (paired t-test). Inter-observer reproducibility of caliper replacement was performed on a random sub-sample of 10 % of the scans. Results: A total of 20, 029 scans provided measurements using both methods. The intra-observer variability based on the triplicate measurements for the two methods was not significantly different (HCellipse vs HCcalc p[*]=[*] 0. 41; ACellipse vs ACcalc p[*]=[*] 0. 36). The mean systematic differences (95 % limits of agreement) for the inter-observer variability were all similar (HCellipse: − 2. 4 (6. 6, − 11. 5); HCcalc: − 1. 9 (7. 7, − 11. 6); ACellipse: 0. 10 (11. 6, − 11. 4); ACcalc: 0. 06 (11. 8, − 12. 0) mm). Conclusions: There are minimal differences in measurement variability between the ellipse and two diameters methods, which suggests the two methods are equally reproducible. There appears to be no advantage in using one method over the other in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Early life {{exposure}} to arsenic {{is associated with}} decreased birth weight in highly exposed populations but {{little is known about}} effects of low-level arsenic exposure on growth in utero. Methods Using a sample of 272 pregnancies from New Hampshire we obtained biometric measurements directly from fetal ultrasound reports commonly found in electronic medical records. We used information extraction methods to develop and validate an automated approach for mining biometric measurements from the text of clinical reports. As a preliminary analysis, we examined associations between in utero low-level arsenic exposure (as measured by maternal urinary arsenic concentration) and fetal growth measures (converted to Z-scores based on reference populations for estimated fetal weight, head, and other body measures) at approximately 18  weeks of gestation. Results In a preliminary cross-sectional analysis of 223 out of 272 pregnancies, maternal urinary arsenic concentration (excluding arsenobetaine) was associated with a reduction in head circumference Z-score (Spearman correlation coefficient, rs[*]=[*]- 0. 08, p-value[*]=[*] 0. 21) and a stronger association was observed among female fetuses at approximately 18  weeks of gestation (rs[*]=[*]- 0. 21, p-value[*]<[*] 0. 05). Although, associations were attenuated in adjusted analyses — among female fetuses a 1  μg/L increase in maternal urinary arsenic concentration was associated with a decrease of 0. 047 (95 % CI: - 0. 115, 0. 021) in head circumference and 0. 072 (95 % CI: - 0. 151, 0. 007) decrease in <b>biparietal</b> head <b>diameter</b> Z-score. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that useful data can be extracted directly from electronic medical records for epidemiologic research. We also found evidence that {{exposure to}} low-level arsenic may be associated with reduced head circumference in a sex dependent manner that warrants further investigation...|$|R

50|$|Ultrasound {{cephalometry}} {{is useful}} for determining baby growth in utero. Cephalometry can also determine if an unborn child will pass through the birth canal. Certain 3D imaging applications are now used in obstetric cephalometry. In 1961, Donald and Brown employed ultrasound technique for measurement of the fetal head. Other scientists tried the method {{and found that the}} ultrasound technique was 3mm different than the post-natal measurement with calipers. This method requires that the transponder be placed on the maternal abdomen over the area of the fetal head. The transponder is moved until a pair of echos are strong and equal. This indicates that the parietals are perpendicular to the transmitting beam. The distance of the reflections equal the <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter.</b> From this, the size of the head and the fetal weight can be determined with incredible accuracy. The use of ultrasound cephalometry is meant to be used in addition to other radiographic techniques. Thus far, no ill effects have been reported to the fetus or the mother using the ultrasound fetal cephalometry.|$|E
5000|$|Gestational age {{is usually}} {{determined}} by {{the date of the}} woman's last menstrual period, and assuming ovulation occurred on day fourteen of the menstrual cycle. Sometimes a woman may be uncertain of the date of her last menstrual period, or there may be reason to suspect ovulation occurred significantly earlier or later than the fourteenth day of her cycle. Ultrasound scans offer an alternative method of estimating gestational age. The most accurate measurement for dating is the crown-rump length of the fetus, which can be done between 7 and 13 weeks of gestation. After 13 weeks of gestation, the fetal age may be estimated using the <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> (the transverse diameter of the head, across the two parietal bones), the head circumference, the length of the femur, the crown-heel length (head to heel), and other fetal parameters. [...] Dating is more accurate when done earlier in the pregnancy; if a later scan gives a different estimate of gestational age, the estimated age is not normally changed but rather it is assumed the fetus is not growing at the expected rate.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} sildenafil citrate (SC) to improve placental and fetal growth in a diet-induced rabbit model of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Pregnant rabbits were fed either ad libitum (Group C) or restricted to 50 % of dietary requirements (Group R) or restricted and treated with SC (Group SC). The treatment with SC improved placental development by increasing vascularity and vessel hypertrophy in the decidua. The assessment of feto–placental haemodynamics showed higher resistance and pulsatility indices at the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in fetuses treated with SC when compared with Group R, which had increased systolic peak and time-averaged mean velocities at the MCA. Furthermore, fetuses in the SC group had significantly higher <b>biparietal</b> and thoracic <b>diameters</b> and longer crown–rump lengths than fetuses in Group R. Hence, the SC group had a reduced IUGR rate and a higher kit size at birth compared with Group R. In conclusion, SC may provide potential benefits in pregnancies with placental insufficiency and IUGR, partially counteracting {{the negative effects of}} food restriction on placental development and fetal growth.

40|$|Diagnostic {{ultrasound}} {{was introduced}} in the practice of obstetrics through its ability to measure accurately the <b>biparietal</b> (DBP) <b>diameter</b> of the foetus. The development of bidimensional and grey tone images expanded the possibility of fetal biometry. One of its most important uses is the estimation of gestational age. A knowledge of foetal age is necessary to interpret the results of most of the investigations currently performed during pregnancy. Different fetal dimensions increase with age at different rates according to the period of gestation. During the embryonic period, the crown-rump length gives a very good estimation of age within 4 - 6 days for twice the standard deviation. Later on, because of the curvature of the fetus, the age is estimated with the DBP. The accuracy diminishes with the slowing down of fetal growth, from 12 weeks onwards, when twice the standard deviation of the age estimate may be as long as 2 weeks. When DBP is no longer reliable in determining age, femur length is measured being more reliable for that purpose at least till 24 weeks. A very early assessment of foetal age reduces the risk of errors in estimating the duration of pregnancy and is important to detect early growth retardation (IUGR); this is usually symmetric, i. e. affecting all fetal parts (versus asymmetrical or late IUGR where trunk growth is first involved). Fetal weight can be estimated by fetal parts measurements. A formula was derived as long as twenty years ago but not all authorities agree on any measuring technique as evidenced by the many different formulas proposed-a sign that no very satisfactory one yet exists. Nevertheless the estimate should not exceed 15 % of the true weight. The calculation of the fetal volume should theoretically be the best method but it needs sophisticated computer and software facilities. Besides head, trunk and limbs, any other fetal structures may be measured such as adrenals, kidneys, cerebral ventricles, orbits. They contribute more particularly to the detection of fetal abnormalities. Detection of retarded fetal growth (IUGR) {{is one of the major}} goals of pregnancy surveillance by ultrasound. The authors report on a prospective study based on 2 ultrasound examinations only, the first to assess gestational age, the second fetal growth. The head, chest and abdominal diameters which were below the 20 percentile indicated the cases at risk. Later on, the precocity and accuracy of our antenatal ultrasound determination of fetal sex was an incitement to collect separate biometrial data for male and female fetuses. Their differences were statistically significant and applied therefore to a new appraisal of (IUGR) detection. The new norms brought a higher sensitivity, lower specificity and also a higher predictivity but for DBP only. © 1984. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Medicina (Pediatria), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Medicina, 2013 Preterm birth {{contributes}} {{greatly to}} infant mortality and to significant morbidity in survivors. Despite this, the progress {{made during the}} past few decades in neonatal intensive care translates into improved survival of extremely preterm infants and a good quality of life for most survivors during childhood and adulthood. Major challenges in daily practice for the neonatologist are the ability to predict longer-term outcome, to explain the complexities of these issues to parents and the targeting of appropriate rehabilitation and support for very preterm infants and their families. The greatest challenges in terms of predicting outcomes are not generally present when dealing with infants that have major lesions detected by cerebral ultrasound and possibly better defined by magnetic resonance imaging, but when counselling the parents of babies who reach the term-equivalent age with apparently “normal” brain scans, because we know that some of these infants have poor outcomes that are difficult to predict using current standards. The only brain imaging tool that is widely available to support counselling is cerebral ultrasound and {{there is no evidence to}} support the use of magnetic resonance imaging for all very preterm infants at term-equivalent age, even in high resource settings. Thus, the aim of the research project underlying this thesis is to evaluate less explored contributions of conventional cerebral ultrasound, which were either not previously described or are not used routinely, in order to maximize the information obtained for all very preterm infants. The evaluations of less well explored uses of cerebral ultrasound contained in this thesis are: I. A tridimensional model to estimate cerebral volume at term-equivalent age; II. The usefulness of cerebral ultrasound for the diagnosis of non-cystic white matter injury; III. The utility of cerebellar measurements for evaluating cerebellar growth in very preterm infants during the neonatal period; IV. The utility of cerebellar measurements for estimating gestational age in very low birth weight infants in whom gestational age is uncertain. I - Very preterm infants are at particular risk of neurodevelopmental impairments. This risk can be anticipated when major lesions are seen on cerebral ultrasound. However, most preterm infants do not have such lesions yet many have a relatively poor outcome. Our study aims to describe a tridimensional cerebral ultrasound model at term-equivalent age to help in identifying infants without cerebral ultrasound lesions but with smaller cerebral volume. We scanned a cohort of very preterm infants at term-equivalent age and term-born controls. Infants with major cerebral lesions were excluded. Measurements of intracranial <b>diameters</b> (<b>biparietal,</b> longitudinal, height), brain structures, ventricles and extracerebral space were made. A mathematical model was built to estimate from the cerebral ultrasound measurements the axial area and volumes of the cranium and brain. Clinical data were extracted from the medical records. Appropriate statistical methods were used for comparisons; p-value < 0. 05 was considered significant. We assessed 128 infants (72 preterms and 56 controls). The preterms’ head at term-equivalent age was longer (11. 5 vs. 10. 5 cm, p< 0. 001), narrower (7. 8 vs. 8. 4 cm, p< 0. 001) and taller (8. 9 vs. 8. 6 cm, p< 0. 01) than the controls and the extra-cerebral spaces and the ventricles were larger. Estimated intracranial volume was not statistically different between the groups (411 vs. 399 cm 3, NS), but the preterms had larger estimated extracerebral space volume (70 vs. 22 cm 3, p< 0. 001) and smaller estimated cerebral volume (340 vs. 377 cm 3, p< 0. 001). On bivariate analysis, significant risk factors for a smaller brain volume were lower gestational age and birth weight, being small-for-gestational age, higher CRIB score, need for invasive ventilation, chronic lung disease, hypotension and necrotizing enterocolitis, but only the CRIB score remained significant in a multivariate model. Our data suggest that even in the absence of major cerebral lesions, the average extra-uterine cerebral growth of very preterm infants is compromised. Our model can help identify those preterm infants with smaller brains. Later follow-up data will determine the neurodevelopmental outcome of these preterm infants in relation to their estimated brain volumes. II - Periventricular white matter is particularly vulnerable in very preterm infants. Nowadays cystic periventricular leukomalacia is a rare entity, and non-cystic white matter injury, known as non-cystic periventricular leukomalacia, is the commonest “lesion” affecting the preterm brain. There is no consensus about whether non-cystic periventricular leukomalacia can be reliably identified from cUS or whether there is any reliable correlate of non-cystic periventricular leukomalacia on cerebral ultrasound at term-equivalent age. We aim to compare brain volumes and linear measures at term-equivalent age in infants with and without a diagnosis of non-cystic periventricular leukomalacia. A cohort of preterm infants under 32 weeks gestational age without major lesions were serially assessed using cerebral ultrasound. Non-cystic periventricular leukomalacia was defined as periventricular white matter echogenicity comparable to the choroid plexus seen on two scans at least two weeks apart after the first post-natal week; a diagnosis was achieved by consensus. At term-equivalent age, infants were scanned for the estimation of brain volume and for measuring ventricular dimensions, corpus callosum length/thickness and central grey matter width. Head circumference was also measured. The data were compared between those with/without non-cystic periventricular leukomalacia. Observer agreement was assessed using kappa statistic. Of 63 eligible infants 29 % had non-cystic periventricular leukomalacia. Significant differences were found between those with/without non-cystic periventricular leukomalacia for 5 minute Apgar score, CRIB score, invasive ventilation rates and chronic lung disease but not other relevant clinical data. No significant differences were found for estimated brain volume, ventricular size, corpus callosum length/thickness or central grey matter width. Intra-observer reliability was moderate (kappa= 0. 51 - 0. 56) and inter-observer reliability was poor (kappa= 0. 20 - 0. 32). The results of this study indicate that cerebral ultrasound diagnosis of non-cystic periventricular leukomalacia as we defined it should not be used as a predictor of lower brain growth detectable at TEA, given that infants with this diagnosis showed identical estimated cerebral size at term-equivalent age when compared to babies with normal scans. Additionally, there was an unsatisfactory intra and inter-observer reliability, suggesting a degree of subjectivity in this cerebral ultrasound diagnosis despite the application of well-defined criteria. III - Reduced supra-tentorial brain growth has been shown in preterms by term-equivalent age, but cerebellar growth may be preserved in the absence of supra-tentorial injury. Our study aimed to compare cerebellar size assessed using cerebral ultrasound at term-equivalent age between preterm infants and term-born controls. Cerebellar dimensions (including transverse cerebellar diameter, vermis height, antero-posterior vermis diameter, cerebellar vermis area) were measured using ImageArena® software in 71 infants born at less than 32 weeks gestation and without significant scan abnormality at term-equivalent age and 58 term controls. Observer agreement was evaluated. Compared to controls, preterms at term-equivalent age had smaller transverse cerebellar diameter (4. 9 vs. 5. 2 cm; p< 0. 001) but larger cerebellar vermis area (4. 7 vs. 4. 3 cm 2; p< 0. 005) and antero-posterior vermis diameter (2. 4 vs. 2. 2 cm; p< 0. 001) but these differences were no longer seen after correcting for head shape. In very preterm infants born before 28 weeks gestation and in small-for-gestational age preterms the cerebellar vermis area measurements were statistically similar to controls, whereas transverse cerebellar diameter was still smaller. Our data support neonatal sparing of preterm cerebellar growth that is measureable using cerebral ultrasound, even in the most immature and small-for-gestational age infants. We suggest cerebral ultrasound can be used to assess cerebellar size at term-equivalent age and thus may be a useful tool for detecting infants with poorer cerebellar growth who are at increased risk of disability. IV - Clinical assessment of gestational age in newborn preterm infants can be challenging. Several cerebral ultrasound approaches for estimating gestational age using cerebellar measurements are reported, claiming to be simpler and more accurate than clinical assessment, but they are not widely used. We aimed to compare the accuracy of four previously described measurements and compare their use in preterm infants. We studied infants born at less than 32 weeks gestation defined by in-vitro fertilization date or early fetal ultrasound, excluding infants with neurological problems. Vermis anterior-posterior diameter, vermis height, and transverse cerebellar diameter via anterior and mastoid fontanelles were measured. Estimated post-menstrual age was calculated using published equations, and compared to known post-menstrual age using intraclass correlation coefficient. Intra and inter-observer reliability were determined. We studied 80 infants (mean gestation 28. 5 weeks [range 24 - 32] and mean postnatal age 5. 7 days). Intraclass correlation coefficient was 0. 761 for vermis antero-posterior diameter, 0. 632 for vermis height, 0. 115 for transverse cerebellar diameter measured via the anterior fontanelle and 0. 825 for transverse cerebellar diameter measured via the mastoid fontanelle. The equation for transverse cerebellar diameter measured via the mastoid fontanelle gave the best estimate of gestation (mean estimate - 2 days; 95 %CI± 13. 8 days). The actual measurements of transverse cerebellar diameter were similar whether they were made using the anterior and of mastoid fontanelles as was the accuracy of estimating gestational age using the equation for transverse cerebellar diameter measured via the mastoid fontanelle in both appropriately grown and small-for-gestational age infants. Inter and intra-observer reliability was very good for all measurements. We found that three of the four previously described equations for estimating gestational age from cerebellar measurements gave good estimates of gestational age in preterm infants. The equation described for the transverse cerebellar diameter measured via the mastoid fontanelle gave the narrowest 95 % confidence interval. We recommend the transverse cerebellar diameter measured via the mastoid fontanelle equation for the estimation of gestational age in very low birthweight infants but the transverse cerebellar diameter measurement itself can be performed either via the anterior or mastoid fontanelle. The contribution of some of the less explored approaches to the use of cerebral ultrasound described in this thesis may enhance the identification of very preterm infants that are most at risk of neurodevelopmental problems despite having a “normal” scan during their neonatal period and at term-equivalent age. Since the widespread use of magnetic resonance imaging at term-equivalent age for all very preterm infants is not a reality in the coming years (and the interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging findings in preterms at term-equivalent age and their significance for later outcomes still needs to be defined), improving the information obtained from cerebral ultrasound is of great value in aiding clinicians with counselling parents about their child’s outcome and for selecting the most “at risk” infants for magnetic resonance imaging and/or more intensive follow-up and intervention...|$|R

Results: The mean <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> value was 29. 4 mm at 14 weeks, 49. 4 mm at 20 weeks, 78. 4 mm at 30 weeks, 91. 5 at 37 weeks and 95. 6 mm at 40 weeks. There was {{a positive relationship between}} gestational age and <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> with correlation coefficient of R 2 = 0. 9996 (P < 0. 001), and with fetal weight. The increase in BPD with increasing age in the study population showed a curve similar to that of Europeans. Conclusions: Ultrasonographic measurement of <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> in Nigerian fetuses showed a linear correlation exists between BPD and gestational age, as well as BPD and foetal weight in normal foetuses...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted at (LATU) Large Animal Teaching Unit, Massey University, New Zealand. The study involved 23 beef cows and 60 dairy cows. The aim {{of the study was}} to test and assess the agreement between actual gestational age and that predicted using a model developed in previous studies based on placentome length (gestational age = placentome* 2. 88 - 6. 11; Adeyinka et al., (2014) and to compare this agreement with that obtained using fetal measurements of femur length and head size (<b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter).</b> The research commenced on February 2015 and July 2015 for beef and dairy cows respectively and ended June 2015 and September 2015 for beef and dairy cows respectively. Beef cows were scanned transrectally every after three (3) weeks while dairy cows were scanned every after one (1) week [...] Overall there was no evidence of bias in all the parameters studied. The strongest association (R 2 = 0. 85) was seen in dairy cattle when <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> was measured and the weakest was placentome size in dairy cattle (R 2 = 0. 39). This is the first study that has specifically focused on the agreement between estimates of gestational age from fetal size and actual gestational age. This study has shown <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> to be a better predictor of gestational age than mean placentome size across the range of gestational ages found in this study. However, because the limits-of-agreement for <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> increase as gestational age increases, by 120 days of gestation the difference between the limits-of-agreement for <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> and those for mean placentome size are much smaller than in early gestation, and the limits-of-agreement for <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> are similar to those previously reported where data from all placentomes measured were used to predict gestational age rather than just a single mean placentome size. At 120 days of gestation, placentomes can be measured in a much higher proportion of cattle than <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter,</b> and even when the latter can be measured, placentome measurements are markedly easier to obtain. Femur length was by far the most difficult parameter to measure and especially by 120 days was much less precise than mean placentome size or <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter.</b> Therefore, femur length should be restricted to use only in early gestation and then should be used alongside other parameters like <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter...</b>|$|E
40|$|Ninety eight newborn infants {{weighing}} {{less than}} 1500 g at birth and with gestational ages from 26 to 32 weeks were followed prospectively. They were grouped according to real time ultrasound scans in the neonatal period: infants in group A (n = 20) had periventricular haemorrhage (PVH) and normal ventricles; infants in group B (n = 26) had PVH and dilated ventricles (none with clinical hydrocephalus); and infants in group C, who formed {{the control group}} (n = 52), had no PVH and normal ventricles. At outpatient follow up a static image ultrasound scanner {{was used to measure}} the width of the lateral ventricles and brain hemispheres. The three groups of infants showed similar growth in occipitofrontal circumference, <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter,</b> and brain hemispheres irrespective of a history of PVH or ventricular dilatation. The relation of ventricle size to <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> was similar in those infants in groups A (PVH alone) and C (controls) who had a good outcome. About a third (n = 8) of the infants in group B had persistent ventricular dilatation in relation to <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> and a poor outcome associated with developmental delay and cerebral palsy. By contrast, the remaining two thirds (n = 18) of the infants in group B who later had smaller ventricles in relation to <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> showed fewer neurodevelopmental sequelae. It is suggested that persistent ventricular dilatation in relation to <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> at follow up carries a bad prognosis, which might be due to brain atrophy...|$|E
40|$|In {{forensic}} medicine, {{gestational age}} of fetal remains {{is a crucial}} information in several contests, but the classic methods are inadequate when early gestational age needs to be assessed. In the author's experience, the measurement of the <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> provides more accurate information for this purpose. The status of the fetal head is therefore critical. This work describes an easy technique that allows to reconstruct the cranial volume of the fetus using multipurpose silicone given both {{the flexibility of the}} fetal head structure and the inorganic nature of the silicone itself. In conclusion, the determination of the <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> achieved through the above-described technique permitted a more accurate estimation of the dating of pregnancy in judicial cases where the fetal remains were incomplete and disrupted...|$|E
40|$|Measurements on {{the growth}} process and placental {{development}} of the embryo and fetuses of Cavia porcellus were carried out using ultrasonography. Embryo, fetus, and placenta were monitored from Day 15 after mating day {{to the end of}} gestation. Based on linear and quadratic regressions, the following morphometric analysis showed a good indicator of the gestational age: placental diameter, <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter,</b> renal length, and crown rump. The embryonic cardiac beat was first detected at an average of 22. 5 days. The placental diameter showed constant increase from beginning of gestation then remained to term and presented a quadratic correlation with gestational age (r 2 = 0. 89). Mean placental diameter at the end of pregnancy was 3. 5 ± 0. 23 cm. By Day 30, it was possible to measure <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter,</b> which followed a linear pattern of increase up to the end of gestation (r 2 = 0. 95). Mean <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> in the end of pregnancy was 1. 94 ± 0. 03 cm. Kidneys were firstly observed on Day 35 as hyperechoic structures without the distinction of medullar and cortical layers, thus the regression model equation between kidney length and gestational age presents a quadratic relationship (r 2 = 0. 7). The crown rump presented a simple linear growth, starting from 15 days of gestation, displaying a high correlation with the gestational age (r 2 = 0. 9). The offspring were born after an average gestation of 61. 3 days. In this study, we conclude that <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter,</b> placental diameter, and crown rump are adequate predictive parameters of gestational age in guinea pigs because they present high correlation index.

40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} effect of glucose control on {{the rate of growth}} of fetuses in women with pregestational {{diabetes}} mellitus (Types 1 and 2). Methods All pregestational diabetic women booked at Mater Mothers’ Hospital, Brisbane, Australia, between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 2002, were included. Pregnancies with congenital fetal anomalies, multiple pregnancies, and pregnancies terminated prior to 20 weeks’ gestation were excluded. Dating scans were performed before 14 weeks’ gestation and serial scans were performed at 18, 24, 28, 32 and 36 weeks. Fetal parameters, including <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter,</b> femur length and abdominal circumference, were recorded. The daily growth rates for <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter,</b> femur length, and fetal abdominal area were calculated and compared with those in a low-risk (non-diabetic) population.

40|$|Normal {{growth of}} the lateral ventricles (LVs) was {{characterized}} three-dimensionally using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 16 human fetuses at 16 - 25 weeks of gestation. The LV was differentiated into four primary regions, the anterior horn, central parts, posterior horn, and inferior horn, at 16 weeks of gestation. The LV changed shape mainly by elongation and narrowing, which corresponded to the external and internal {{growth of the}} surrounding cerebrum. Six length parameters measured in the LV correlated with <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> by simple regression analysis (R 2 range, 0. 56 - 0. 93), which may be valuable for establishing a standardized prenatal protocol to assess fetal well-being and development across intrauterine periods.

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether fetal growth parameters in Aboriginal pregnancies are such that separate fetal growth charts are necessary for their appropriate care. We designed a prospective study of a cohort of Aboriginal women presenting for antenatal care before 20 weeks gestation (ultrasound proven) and a reference cohort of Caucasian women. Four remote North Queensland communities served by the Far North Regional Obstetric and Gynaecological Service (FROGS) and the antenatal clinic at Cairns Base Hospital {{took part in the}} survey. One hundred and four Aboriginal and 101 Caucasian women with no known medical factors affecting fetal growth or gestation were recruited, and 96 Aboriginal and 96 Caucasian women completed the study. Measurements took the form of longitudinal percentile charts of fetal <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter,</b> abdominal circumference and femur length. Ultrasound measurements of fetal <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter,</b> abdominal circumference and femur length were obtained 3 to 5 times during Aboriginal and Caucasian pregnancies, where the gestation was established by ultrasound before 20 weeks gestation, and no known medical conditions which affect fetal growth were present in the mother. There were no statistical or clinically important differences in <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter,</b> femur length and abdominal circumference of Aboriginal and Caucasian fetuses. We concluded that {{there is no reason to}} use separate fetal growth charts when examining Aboriginal fetal growt...|$|E

40|$|Ultrasonographic {{measurements}} {{were made at}} least once a month during 14 gestations in seven Tursiops truncatus and 12 gestations in five Tursiops aduncus (bottlenosed dolphins). The 121 measurements of the fetal <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> and 139 measurements of the fetal thoracic diameter in T truncatus and the 97 measurements of the <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> and 97 measurements of the thoracic diameter in T aduncus were used to establish regression lines for the increases in the diameter of the head and thorax of the fetus with time. From these relationships an easy-to-use computer program was developed to predict the date of birth of the two species of bottlenosed dolphin, and its predictions were compared with the actual dates of birth of other calves of both species. The births occurred within the range of predicted dates, and even when only a few {{measurements were}} available, the program provided accurate predictions. School of Optometr...|$|E

Objectives To assess relationship between fetal pinna length and gestation age and develop a nomogram. To assess relationship between fetal pinna length and head circumference and <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter.</b> Methods Fetal pinna measurements {{from the tip of}} helix to the end of lobe were obtained prospectively in 850 singleton pregnant women between 15 and 40 weeks ’ gestation Normal case was defined as normal sonographic findings during examination and normal infant examination at birth or both. Final study population was 787. The relationship between gestational age in weeks to pinna length in millimeters was analyzed by simple linear regression. Correlation of fetal ear length measurements with gestational age, <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> and head circumference were also obtained. Results Linear relationships were found between fetal pinna length and gestational age [Pinna Length (mm) = 1. 044 xGestational age (weeks) - 3. 857]. A nomogram of normal pinna length was obtained. High correlation was found between pinna length and gestational age (r= 0. 942; p< 0. 001), pinna length and head circumference (r= 0. 931; p< 0. 001). Significant correlation was found between pinna length and <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> (r= 0. 934; p= 0. 004) Conclusions The results of this study provide a nomogram for fetal pinna.

40|$|Background & Objectives: Estimation of {{the length}} of {{gestation}} is of paramount importance to obstetricians. The fetal cerebellum grows progressively along gestational period and transverse cerebellar diameter {{can be used as a}} new biometric parameter to assess the gestational age of fetus. This study was done to evaluate the accuracy transverse cerebellar diameter against other regularly measured parameters like <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter,</b> head circumference, abdominal circumference and femur length in pregnant women between 15 to 40 weeks of gestation. Materials & Methods: In this study of 60 pregnant women between 15 - 40 weeks of gestation, all the parameters like <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter,</b> head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length and transverse cerebellar diameter were measured with ultrasonography. The measured values were then correlated with gestational age using regression coefficient. Results: Gestational age estimated by transverse cerebellar diameter (R 2 = 0. 989; p < 0. 001) had good predictive value which was comparable to gestational age estimated by <b>biparietal</b> <b>diameter</b> (R 2 = 0. 929; P < 0. 01), head circumference (R 2 = 0. 964; P < 0. 01), abdominal circumference (R 2 = 0. 931; P < 0. 01) and fetal length (R 2 = 0. 966; P < 0. 01).   Conclusion: Transverse cerebellar diameter has a good predictive accuracy for gestational age estimation which is comparableto other routinely used parameters and can be used as an alternative parameter to predict the gestational age. </p...|$|E
