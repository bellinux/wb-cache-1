5|$|Over 300 {{species of}} birds have been sighted in the park {{including}} the calliope hummingbird, the smallest bird species in North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America's largest waterfowl. In addition to trumpeter swans, another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including blue-winged teal, common merganser, American wigeon and the colorful but reclusive harlequin duck which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon. Both bald and golden eagles and other birds of prey such as the osprey, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel and occasional sightings of peregrine falcon have been reported. Of the 14 species of owls reported, the most common is the great horned owl, though the boreal owl and great grey owl are also seen occasionally. A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported, as have a similar number of species of warblers, plovers and gulls.

50|$|Birds in a {{communal}} roost {{can reduce the}} impact of wind and cold weather by sharing body heat through huddling, which reduces the overall energy demand of thermoregulation.

2500|$|Meadow voles are an {{important}} prey for many hawks, owls, and mammalian carnivores, and they are also taken by some snakes. [...] Almost all species of raptors take microtine (Microtus spp.) rodents as prey. Birds not usually considered predators of mice do take voles; examples include gulls (Larus spp.), northern shrike (Larius borealis), <b>black-billed</b> <b>magpie</b> (Pica pica), common raven (Corvus corax), American crow (C. brachyrhynchos), great blue heron (Ardea herodias), and American bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus). In Ohio, meadow voles comprised 90% of the individual prey remains in long-eared owl (Asio otus) pellets on a relict wet prairie, and in Wisconsin, meadow voles comprised 95% of short-eared owl (A. flammeus) prey. [...] Most mammalian predators take microtine prey. The American short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) is major predator; meadow voles avoid areas frequented by short-tailed shrews. [...] Other major mammalian predators include the badger (Taxidea taxus), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), weasels (Mustela spp.), marten (Martes americana), and domestic cat (Felis catus). [...] Other animals reported to have ingested voles include trout (Salmo spp.), Pacific giant salamander (Dicampton ensatus), garter snake (Thamnophis spp.), yellow-bellied racer (Coluber constrictor flaviventris), gopher snake (Pituophis melanoleucas), rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis), and rubber boa (Charina bottae).|$|E
50|$|When Lewis and Clark first {{encountered}} magpies in 1804 in South Dakota, they reported the birds {{as being very}} bold, entering tents or taking food from the hand. Magpies formerly followed American bison herds (from which they gleaned ticks and insects), {{as well as the}} bands of Plains Indians that hunted the bison so they could scavenge carcasses. When the bison herds were devastated in the 1870s, magpies switched to cattle, and by the 1960s they had also moved into the emerging towns and cities of the North American West. Today <b>black-billed</b> <b>magpies</b> remain relatively tame in areas where they are not persecuted. However, they become very wary in areas where they are often shot at or disturbed. Especially {{during the first half of}} the 20th century, <b>black-billed</b> <b>magpies</b> were considered detrimental to game-bird populations (they sometimes steal bird eggs) and domestic stock (they sometimes peck at sores on cattle), and were systematically trapped or shot. Bounties of one cent per egg or two cents per head were offered in many states. In Idaho the death toll eventually amounted to an estimated 150,000. In 1933, 1,033 magpies were shot in Washington’s Okanogan valley by two teams of bounty hunters. Many magpies also died from eating poison set out for coyotes and other predators.|$|R

Geese nest in the park each summer, and flocks of sandhill cranes and swans pass overhead each year on their migratory flights. California quail, chukar partridges, and mourning doves are also common. Others seen near the Cant Ranch and the visitor's center include rufous hummingbirds, Say's phoebe, yellow warblers, western meadowlarks, and American goldfinches.

50|$|Predation is {{a common}} source of mortality, {{typically}} also occurring with eggs, nestlings and fledgings. Common predators at Baltimore oriole nests can include common grackles, American crows, Blue Jays, <b>black-billed</b> <b>magpies,</b> tree squirrels and domestic cats, which most commonly capture newly fledged orioles or adults engaged in brooding behavior. Rapacious birds commonly prey on both young and fully-grown orioles, the most prolific being the eastern screech owl and Cooper's and sharp-shinned hawks. Somewhat larger rapacious birds also sometimes opportunistically predate the oriole, including peregrine falcons, great horned owls, and barn owls, while merlins may do so while orioles are migrating.|$|R
2500|$|The {{predominant}} avifauna of the Aspen Parkland are {{house wren}} (Troglodytes aedon), least flycatcher ( [...] Empidonax minimus), yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia) and western kingbird (Tyrannus verticalis). Sharp-tailed grouse (Tympahuchus phasianellus), ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), <b>black-billed</b> <b>magpie</b> (Pica pica), cormorant (Phalacrocorax spp.), ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis), glaucous-winged gull (Larus glaucescens) and neotropical migrant bird species. The Aspen Parkland with its many sloughs and saline lakes provides breeding grounds for ducks and other waterfowl, black tern (Chlidonias niger), Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri), American white pelican. Typical birds of the Moist Mixed Grassland ecoregion include waterfowl around ponds and sloughs {{and the western}} meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), yellow-headed blackbird (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus), piping plover (Charadrius melodus), sharp-tailed grouse, eastern kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus), and Franklin's gull.

2500|$|Although quantitatively {{outnumbered by}} mammals, birds {{are the most}} diverse class of prey in the golden eagle's diet, as more than 200 species have been {{identified}} at eagle nests. Little analysis has gone into how regularly golden eagles will attack the nestling and fledglings of other birds, {{although it has been}} interpreted that this behavior is not uncommon, although adults {{are more likely to be}} golden eagle prey than immatures. Nestling-aged rock pigeons (Columba livia) have been observed as prey in golden eagle nests. The first record of a golden eagle eating eggs was recorded when a golden eagle was observed consuming Canada goose (Branta canadensis) eggs in eastern Idaho. After galliforms, the next most significant group of prey among birds is the corvid family, making up 4.1% of the diet from around the range. Most prevalent among these are magpies and the large-bodied Corvus (crow and raven) genus. On Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands in California, common raven became the most common prey species after feral pigs were eradicated from the latter, making up 24% of a 454 sample size from 14 nests. The raven was also the most prevalent bird prey in central Arizona, in a sampling of 1154 from 119 nests. The <b>black-billed</b> <b>magpie</b> (Pica hudsonia) was an important prey item in Washington state, making up 9.7% of the remains there, and was the most significant avian prey in Montana. In 10 studies in Europe, corvids made up more than 5% of the prey remains, usually represented by carrion crows/hooded crows (Corvus corone/cornix), rooks (Corvus frugilegus), Alpine chough (Pyrrhocorax graculus), ravens or Eurasian magpies (Pica pica). Smaller species such as jays and nutcrackers only occasionally turn up as prey, mainly in North America, though the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) has also been known as prey. The next best represented family of birds are the waterfowl, making up approximately 1.4% of the golden eagle's breeding season diet. Waterfowl of all sizes from green-winged teal (Anas crecca) to trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator), tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) and mute swans (Cygnus olor) have been successfully hunted by golden eagles. Full-grown swans can weigh well over [...] and are probably the largest birds habitually hunted by golden eagles. Moderately sized species, including larger Anas ducks such as mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and geese such as bean goose (Anser fabalis) are perhaps most often recorded. Waterfowl are mostly recorded during the nesting season in Northern Europe, comprising 15.4% of prey in Gotland and 14.4% of prey in Belarus. In some years at Malheur-Harney Lakes Basin in Oregon, Anas ducks can make up to 20% of the prey consumed by the locally nesting eagles. Mostly in the United States, wintering golden eagles may become habitually predators of wintering and migrating groups of waterfowl, with species such as Canada geese, cackling geese (Branta hutchinsii), snow geese (Chen caerulescens), and Ross's geese (Chen rossii). Since geese are found in large concentration when seasonal conditions require it, these species can be hunted with relative ease. Waterfowl are typically hunted using the “contour flight with short glide attack” technique, in order to surprise the prey before it can take flight or dive. In one case, a golden eagle was able to capture a mallard as it took off in flight. Other water birds are generally less frequent prey but may become regular in the diet in marsh-like northern regions and coastal areas. Scotland, being surrounded by coasts and possessing quite a wet climate, often hosts water birds which become prey such as colonies of petrels (largely northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis)), making up to 17% of the recorded prey in 26 nests with a 119 sample size in the Outer Hebrides, migrating throngs of sandpipers and plovers (up to 5.9% and 2.8% in 25 nest in the northern Inner Hebrides) and gulls (making up a whopping 23% of prey recorded in 25 nests in the West-Central Highlands). Among shorebirds, usually only larger types such as godwits, curlews, Tringa sp., stone-curlews and oystercatchers turn up as prey, although smaller species are probably also taken as prey since they are agile enough to catch them. Eurasian cranes (Grus grus) are regularly predated in Northern Europe, turning up at 6.8% of nests in Estonia and 5.8% of nests in southern Finland. Hooded cranes (Grus monacha) are reportedly prey for golden eagles in China. Demoiselle cranes (Anthropoides virgo) have been caught in mid-air as they migrate over the Himalayas and both sandhill (Grus canadensis) and whooping cranes (Grus americana) may be hunted in North America. The last known breeding pair of golden eagles in Maine (which did not return after 1999) were reported to hunt an unusually large number of herons, specifically great blue herons (Ardea herodias) and American bitterns (Botaurus lentiginosus). Elsewhere, herons are basically negligible in the diet. Other water birds recorded as prey include cormorants (up to 8.6% of the recorded prey in Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands), auks, grebes and loons.|$|E

40|$|<b>Black-billed</b> <b>magpies</b> (Pica pica) are {{a highly}} {{sedentary}} species {{due to their}} short and round wings, which are not adequatefor long distance flights. We investigated geographic variation in the vocal signals of magpies residing in SouthKorea and Japan (subspecies sericea). Based on the magpie’s limited dispersal ability, we predicted that the variation invocal signals of <b>black-billed</b> <b>magpies</b> {{could be explained by}} geographic barriers such as mountain ranges and straits. We analyzed four-syllable chatter calls of magpies from five localities in South Korea, which are separated by mountainranges (Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, Gwangju, and Busan), and two island localities separated from the mainland by straits(Jeju in Korea and Saga in Japan). We found significant differences in the characteristics of magpie chatter calls recordedin the seven localities, and the variation pattern was independent among the variables. Mainland-island differentiationand north-south differentiation were observed. In general, magpies on Saga were the most distinctive. North-south differentiationwas observed among the Korean mainland localities. However, the pattern was not related to the presence ofputative geographic barriers. We hypothesize that the patterns of geographic variation in the structure of magpie chattercalls residing in South Korea might have been shaped by a sudden expansion of magpies followed by low level of localisolation, which may have led to vocal differentiation. Along with elucidating the vocal environment of Korean magpiepopulations, more extensive sampling is needed to clarify the functional aspects of geographic variation in the vocalsignals of Korean magpies...|$|R
