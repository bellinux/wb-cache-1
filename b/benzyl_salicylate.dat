The relative contents of the main volatile fragrance from flowers of Chimonanthus praecox (L.) Link in various florescence were different. After analyzing the volatile compounds, multiple linear regression within Cerius(2) molecular modeling program package was used for building the regression model. Then the quantitative structure-retention relationship model was validated by predictive-ability test. The regression coefficient r (2) was 0. 972. The prediction results were in good agreement with the experimental values. The results demonstrated that headspace SPME-GC-MS is a simple, rapid and solvent-free method suitable for analysis of volatile compounds emitted from fresh flowers in various florescence. This investigation provided an effective method for predicting the retention index of new compounds {{even in the absence of}} the standard candidates.

40|$|Results of the {{investigation}} of the essential oil and glycosidically bound volatile compounds of Calamintha nepeta (L.) Savi are presented in the paper. The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and glycosides were extracted with ethyl acetate. The yield of essential oil was W = 0. 91 %. The essential oil was fractionated on a microcolumn with solvents of different polarity. One fraction of terpene hydrocarbons and four fractions of oxygenated terpene compounds were obtained. All fractions were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) on two columns with different polarity of the stationary phases. The purpose of the fractionation was to obtain a more completely analysis. In this way, sixtyfive compounds were identified. In contrast, only twenty-four compounds were identified in the essential oil without fractionation. The main components were piperitone oxide, piperitenone oxide, limonene, caryophyllene, thymol, linalool, 3 -octanol and other compounds in smaller amounts. After isolation, final purification of the glycosides by »flash« chromatography on silicagel column and enzymatic hydrolysis, the liberated aglycones were analyzed {{in the same way as}} the essential oil fractions. The content of volatile aglycones was W = 0. 00081 % or 8. 1 mg kg- 1 of the plant material. Eighteen compounds were identified. The main aglycones were eugenol, carveol, 3 -octanol, 3 -hexene- 1 -ol, 2 -butanol, 2 -phenylethanol, methyl <b>salicylate,</b> <b>benzyl</b> alcohol, acetophenone derivates, and others.

40|$|A list of 1719 {{chemical}} compounds identified from headspace samples of floral scent is presented. The list has been compiled from some 270 published papers, including analyses of 991 species of flowering plants {{and a few}} gymnosperms, a sample including seed plants from 90 families and 38 orders. The compounds belong to seven major compound classes, of which the aliphatics, the benzenoids and phenylpropanoids, and, among the terpenes, the mono- and sesquiterpenes, occur in most orders of seeds plants. C 5 -branched compounds, irregular terpenes, nitrogen-containing compounds, and a class of miscellaneous Cyclic Compounds have been recorded in {{about two-thirds of the}} orders. Sulfur-containing compounds occur in a third of the orders, whereas diterpenes have been reported from three orders only. The most common single Compounds in floral scent are the monoterpenes limonene, (E) -beta-ocimene, myrcene, linalool, alpha-and beta-pinene, and the benzenoids benzaldehyde, methyl 2 -hydroxybenzoate (methyl <b>salicylate),</b> <b>benzyl</b> alcohol, and 2 -phenyl ethanol, which occur in 54 - 71 % of the families investigated so far. The sesquiterpene caryophyllene and the irregular terpene 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one are also common and occur in more than 50 % of the families. Orchidaceae are by far the best investigated family, followed by several families known to have many species with strongly scented flowers, such as Araceae, Arecaceae, Magnoliaceac, and Rosaceae. However, the majority of angiosperm families are still poorly investigated. Relationships between floral scent and pollination, chemistry, evolution, and phylogeny are briefly discussed. It is concluded that floral scent chemistry is of little use for phylogenetic estimates above the genus level, whereas the distribution and combinations of floral scent compounds at species and subspecific levels is a promising field of investigation for the understanding of adaptations and evolutionary processes in angiosperms...|$|R

At 3 000 000 -fold molar excess, {{they were able to}} partially displace [H- 3]oestradiol from recombinant human oestrogen receptors ER alpha and ER beta, and from cytosolic ER of MCF 7 cells. At concentrations in the range of 5 x 10 (- 5) to 5 x 10 (- 4) M, they were able to increase the expression of a stably integrated oestrogen-responsive reporter gene (ERE-CAT) and of the endogenous oestrogen-responsive pS 2 gene in MCF 7 cells, albeit to a lesser extent than with 10 (- 8) M 17 beta-oestradiol. They increased the proliferation of oestrogen-dependent MCF 7 cells over 7 days, which could be inhibited by the antioestrogen fulvestrant, suggesting an ER-mediated mechanism. Although the extent of stimulation of proliferation over 7 days was lower with these compounds than with 10 (- 8) M 17 beta-oestradiol, given a longer time period of 35 days the extent of proliferation with 10 (- 4) M <b>benzyl</b> <b>salicylate,</b> {{benzyl benzoate}} or butylphenylmethylpropional increased to the same magnitude as observed with 10 (- 8) M 17 beta-oestradiol over 14 days.

To prevent the entrainment of the catalyst into outlet streams, two membranes were installed in the reactor with a lipophilic type in the upside and a hydrophilic one in the downside of the reaction zone. With 0. 025 mol of tetrabutylphosphonium bromide, 0. 125 mol of NaBr and 0. 67 M of sodium salicylate in the aqueous phase to form the third-liquid phase, the yield of <b>benzyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> in the organic outlet was 82 % at steady-state for the conditions of 0. 33 M of benzyl bromide in n-heptane, space time at 290 min, stirring speed at 300 rpm and temperature at 70 C.

This study {{investigated}} {{the ability of the}} honeybee to discriminate between six compounds previously identified as oilseed rape floral volatiles: linalool, 2 -phenylethanol, methyl <b>salicylate,</b> <b>benzyl</b> alcohol, (£) - 2 -hexenal and l-octen- 3 -ol. These components were tested individually or in a synthetic mixture for their ability to elicit the conditioned proboscis extension response. Three experiments were done: conditioning to the mixture at one concentration (1. 0, 0. 1 or 0. 01 p % per component) and testing to the individual components either at the conditioning or at the other concentrations; conditioning to individual components and testing to the mixture (1. 0 ng); conditioning and testing to the individual components (1. 0 pg). The results from the proboscis extension assay were then compared to those obtained from free-flying bees in a flight room. From the conditioned proboscis extension assay, a conditioning threshold level was found (0. 1 pg for the mixture studied) below which a reliable conditioning could not be achieved. Recognition thresholds were observed: bees responded to concentrations ten-fold higher or lower than that used for conditioning. Responses to lower concentrations were weaker, whilst responses were increased at concentrations higher than the conditioning one. A hierarchy within the compounds tested was found, with linalool, 2 -phenylethanol and methyl salicylate cueing mixture recognition more effectively than the other components. The ranking order of the six components was similar in both the conditioned proboscis extension and the conditioned foraging behaviour in flight room. When conditioned and tested to the individual components, bees discriminated a learned odour from a number of others. However, the specificity level for the recognition of dw learned odour varied according to the component, the most clearly discriminated being the compounds which were used by the bee in mixture recognition...|$|R

Sequence analysis of a fragment amplified by polymerase chain reaction located the inaA 1 ::lac fusion joint within an open reading frame 311 nucleotides downstream of nrdB, transcribed in the opposite direction, encoding a 168 -amino-acid polypeptide. Constitutive mutant strains identified on lactose MacConkey revealed a novel regulatory locus unlinked to inaA, which mapped at 34 min (designated inaR). Expression of inaA 1 ::lac increased slightly with external acidification; the presence of benzoate, a membrane-permeant weak acid, greatly increased the acid effect. The expression at various combinations of benzoate and external pH correlated with the decrease in intracellular pH. The uncouplers salicylate and dinitrophenol also caused acid-dependent induction of inaA, but substantial induction was seen at external pH values higher than the internal pH; this effect cannot be caused by internal acidification. Nondissociating analogs of benzoate and <b>salicylate,</b> <b>benzyl</b> alcohol and salicyl alcohol, did not induce inaA. Expression of inaA was inversely related to growth temperature over the range of 30 to 45 degrees C.

The product yield above 98 % was achieved within 1 h at 70 degreesC by using tetra-n-butylammonium bromide as the catalyst. A kinetic model was developed for the solid-liquid reaction. The overall reaction can be described by pseudo-first-order kinetics with the apparent activation energy in chlorobenzene to be 62. 52 kJ mol(- 1). (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, {{and primary}} liver cancer. Despite 130 million people being at risk worldwide, no vaccine exists, and {{effective}} therapy {{is limited by}} drug resistance, toxicity, and high costs. The tetraspanin CD 81 is an essential entry-level receptor required for HCV infection of hepatocytes and represents a critical target for intervention. In this study, we report the first structural characterization of the large extracellular loop of CD 81, expressed in mammalian cells and studied in physiological solutions. The HCV E 2 glycoprotein recognizes CD 81 through a dynamic loop on the helical bun-dle, which was shown by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to adopt a conformation distinct from that seen in crystals. A novel membrane binding interface was revealed adjacent to the exposed HCV interaction site in the extracellular loop of CD 81. The binding pockets for two proposed inhibitors of the CD 81 -HCV interaction, namely, <b>benzyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> and fexofena-dine, were shown to overlap the HCV andmembrane interaction sites. Although the dynamic loop region targeted by these com-pounds presents challenges for structure-based design, the NMR assignments enable realistic screening and validation of li-gands. Together, these data provide an improved avenue for developing potent agents that specifically block CD 81 -HCV interaction and also pave a way for elucidating the recognition mechanisms of diverse tetraspanins. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global public healthproblem, with symptoms including chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (36). HCV encodes two envelope glycoproteins, E 1 and E 2, that interact to form an E 1 E...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of esterification {{of sodium}} salicylate with benzyl bromide to produce <b>benzyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> was investigated via third-liquid phase-transfer catalysis. The {{formation of the}} third-liquid phase from the interaction of aqueous reactant, inorganic salts, organic solvent, and catalyst was investigated to find the characteristics of catalytic intermediate in the tri-liquid system. The minimum quantity of tetra-n-butylphosphonium bromide (TBPB) required to form the third-liquid phase was affected {{by the addition of}} NaBr, but the variation was insignificant with greater amount of TBPB. The volume of third-liquid increased with increasing amount of TBPB, and using 20 - 70 cm(3) of water for 30 cm(3) of n-heptane solvent favors the formation of the third-liquid phase. The interfacial tension between the aqueous and the third-liquid phases was 1 - 3 mN/m, much less than 9 - 12 mN/m for the third-liquid/heptane interface, indicating that the mass transfer resistance dominates in the heptane side. The product can be present in both organic and third-liquid phases, and above 85 % of the product yield in the organic phase can be obtained using 0. 006 mol of TBPB to form the third-liquid phase. The distribution of the catalytic intermediate between the aqueous and the third-liquid phases was measured, and above 86 % of catalyst in the third-liquid phase {{is in the form of}} catalytic intermediate. The reaction mechanism and kinetic model were proposed and the pseudo-first-order kinetics was successfully applied, the apparent activation energy in heptane being 73. 94 kJ/mol when TBPB was used as the catalyst.

40|$|In {{moderately}} colored guinea-pig skin, UVB, PUVA (psoralen plus UVA), and allergic {{contact dermatitis}} were shown to induce visibly well-defined hyperpigmentation that resembled the pigmentary changes observed in Mongoloid human skin. To clarify mechanisms of allergen-induced hyperpigmentation, we compared the effects of {{allergic contact dermatitis}} on pigmentation by using 6 different allergens: dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), 1 -phenylazo- 2 -naphthol (PAN), <b>benzyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> (BS), jasmine oil (JO), hydroxycitronella (HC), and ylang ylang oil (YYO). The PAN-, JO-, HG-, and YYO-induced allergic reactions caused a definite visible hyperpigmentation that began to appear within 14 days, reaching maximum intensity about 40 days after the induction of the allergic reaction. These hyperpigmentations were accompanied by {{a significant increase in}} the population of dopa-positive melanocytes on day 24 following allergic reactions. In contrast, BS- and DNCB-induced allergic reactions did not give rise to visibly distinct hyperpigmentation in spite of the intensive allergic reactions following their challenge application. In a nonsensitized group, primary irritant reactions were induced by the application of 100 % JO, but no distinctive hyperpigmentation was found 40 days after the last application. Quantitative analysis of the number of melanophages in the dermis showed that there was a marked increase in the number of melanophages in PAN, YYO, and HC allergy-induced hyperpigmented areas, with PAN showing a significant increase compared with those in non- treated areas of the same animals, whereas JO was associated with no such increase in hyperpigmented area, despite the stimulated pigmentation. In the case of the lack of induced hyperpigmentation, as seen in BS and DNCB allergy and JO irritation, there was also no substantial increase in the number of melanophages. Our findings indicate that allergic contact dermatitis is a unique melanogenic stimulant different from UV irradiation...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to analyze the bioactive compounds in three natural sources: kombucha tea, Cryptocarya massoy, and Rollinia emarginata. Bioactive constituents were isolated in pure form using bioactivity-directed fractionation and assayed by the brine shrimp lethality test. Pure compounds were tested further in vitro using a panel of six tumor cell lines derived from human solid tumors. The only agent in kombucha tea that was found to be cytotoxic was caffeine, which was isolated from the bacterial mat, not the beverage, the only part consumed. It is unlikely that kombucha tea is effective as an anticancer agent, although tests were not done in animals. Consumption of kombucha tea has been associated with a number of cases of toxic reactions, either through contamination of the beverage or the bacterial mat or through physiological problems related to acidosis. Kombucha tea therefore has no proven effectiveness as an anticancer agent and actually might be unsafe. Cryptocarya massoy (Oken) Kosterm is a tree that has been used in traditional medicine to treat fevers and is known to resist insect and fungal predation. Benzyl benzoate, <b>benzyl</b> <b>salicylate,</b> goniothalamin, heptyl-lactone, and nonyllactone were found to be the active compounds in C. massoy. Although some of these compounds showed good cytotoxic activity, they can be found in other species. Because C. massoy is endangered in the wild, its collection should be limited. Rollinia emarginata Schlecht. is in the family Annonaceae. The following bioactive compounds were found in R. emarginata: the already known bullatacin, sylvaticin, and rollinicin, and three new acetogenins: remargin, (2, 4 -cis and trans) sylvaticinones, and emarginatin. This species could be a rapidly growing domestic source for bullatacin, which was originally isolated from Annona bullata, a native of Cuba that is therefore unavailable in the United States. ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{novel and}} {{efficient}} method based on headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME), followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), {{was developed for}} the analysis of propolis volatile compounds. The HS-SPME procedure, whose experimental parameters were properly optimized, was carried out using a 100. μm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber. The GC-MS analyses were performed on a HP- 5 MS cross-linked 5 % diphenyl- 95 % dimethyl polysiloxane capillary column (30 m × 0. 25 mm I. D., 1. 00 μm film thickness), under programmed-temperature elution. Ninety-nine constituents were identified using this technique in the samples of raw propolis collected from different Italian regions. The main compounds detected include benzoic acid (0. 87 - 30. 13 %) and its esters, such as benzyl benzoate (0. 16 - 13. 05 %), <b>benzyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> (0. 34 - 1. 90 %) and benzyl cinnamate (0. 34 - 3. 20 %). Vanillin was detected in most of the samples analyzed in this study (0. 07 - 5. 44 %). Another relevant class of volatile constituents is represented by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, such as δ-cadinene (1. 29 - 13. 31 %), γ-cadinene (1. 36 - 8. 85 %) and α-muurolene (0. 78 - 6. 59 %), and oxygenated sesquiterpenes, such as β-eudesmol (2. 33 - 12. 83 %), T-cadinol (2. 73 - 9. 95 %) and α-cadinol (4. 84 - 9. 74 %). Regarding monoterpene hydrocarbons, they were found to be present at low level in the samples analyzed in this study, {{with the exception of one}} sample from Southern Italy, where α-pinene was the most abundant constituent (13. 19 %). The results obtained by HS-SPME-GC-MS were also compared with those of hydrodistillation (HD) coupled with GC-MS. The HS-SPME-GC-MS method developed in this study allowed us to determine the chemical fingerprint of propolis volatile constituents, thus providing a new and reliable tool for the complete characterization of this biologically active apiary product...|$|E
40|$|The first {{objective}} of this thesis was to investigate effects of endocrine disruptors on the developing brain and gonads of bird embryos. The substances studied were the insecticide methoxychlor, and nine UV-filters (3 -benzylidene camphor (3 BC), 4 methyl benzylidene camphor (4 MBC), benzophenone (BP) 1, 2 and 3, 4 hydroxy benzophenone (4 HB), 4 dihydroxy benzophenone (4 DHB), <b>benzyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> (BS), and ethyl- 4 -aminobenzoate Et-PABA)), commonly used in cosmetic products. Some of these substances have no estrogenic effect in vitro, but {{have been shown to}} be estrogenic in vivo. The PCB-mixture Clophen A 50 is a well-known inducer of biotransformation enzymes and was co-administered with methoxychlor and the UV-filters 3 BC and 4 MBC. Exposure to 3 BC or 4 MBC caused ovotestis formation and malformations of the Müllerian ducts in Japanese quail embryos. Co-exposure to one of these compounds and Clophen A 50 enhanced the effects, indicating that Clophen A 50 potentiates the effects of the UV-filters. Embryonic co-exposure to Clophen A 50 and methoxychlor caused a disturbed male sexual behaviour. The metabolites of methoxychlor are estrogen receptor (ER) α-selective, which indicates that the effects on behaviour following embryonic treatment were mediated by ERα. Another objective in this thesis was to localize estrogen receptors (ERs) in the brain of adult and embryonic Japanese quail. The ER localization provides a basis for mechanistic studies on effects of endocrine disruptors, by the identification of estrogen-responsive areas in the brain. We found that ERβ, not previously implicated in sex-differentiation of the brain, was the only ER-subtype present in a sexually dimorphic brain area during differentiation. In conclusion, the estrogenic effects of 3 BC, 4 MBC and methoxychlor were increased by co-exposure to PCB. These results raise concern since many wildlife species, as well as humans, carry large body burdens of persistent organic pollutants like PCBs, which potentially can interact and enhance the effects of other endocrine disruptors...|$|E
