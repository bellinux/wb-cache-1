25|$|A sample {{containing}} {{inorganic cyanide}} is purged with air from a boiling acid solution into a basic absorber solution.

The cyanogen chloride formed couples pyridine with <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> to form a strongly colored red dye that {{is proportional to the}} cyanide concentration. This colorimetric method following distillation is the basis for most regulatory methods (for instance EPA 335.4) used to analyze cyanide in water, wastewater, and contaminated soils. Distillation followed by colorimetric methods, however, {{have been found to be}} prone to interferences from thiocyanate, nitrate, thiosulfate, sulfite, and sulfide that can result in both positive and negative bias.

2500|$|In the United States, [...] the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 {{classified}} most barbiturates as controlled substances—and {{they remain}} so [...] Barbital, methylphenobarbital (also known as mephobarbital), and phenobarbital are designated schedule IV drugs, and [...] "Any substance which contains any quantity of a derivative of <b>barbituric</b> <b>acid,</b> or any salt of a derivative of barbituric acid" [...] (all other barbiturates) were designated as schedule III.

2500|$|<b>Barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} November 27, 1864, by German chemist Adolf von Baeyer. This {{was done by}} condensing urea (an animal waste product) with diethyl malonate (an ester derived from the acid of apples). There are several stories about how the substance got its name. The most likely story is that Baeyer and his colleagues went to celebrate their discovery in a tavern where the town's artillery garrison were also celebrating the feast of Saint Barbara– {{the patron saint of}} artillerymen. An artillery officer is said to have christened the new substance by amalgamating Barbara with urea. [...] Another story holds that Baeyer synthesized the substance from the collected urine of a Munich waitress named Barbara. No substance of medical value was discovered, however, until 1903 when two German scientists working at Bayer, Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering, discovered that barbital was very effective in putting dogs to sleep. Barbital was then marketed by Bayer under the trade name Veronal. It is said that Mering proposed this name because the most peaceful place he knew was the Italian city of Verona.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Barbituric</b> <b>acid</b> {{itself does}} not have any direct effect on the central nervous system and chemists have derived over 2,500 {{compounds}} from it that possess pharmacologically active qualities. The broad class of barbiturates is further broken down and classified according to speed of onset and duration of action. [...] Ultrashort-acting barbiturates are commonly used for anesthesia because their extremely short duration of action allows for greater control. [...] These properties allow doctors to rapidly put a patient [...] "under" [...] in emergency surgery situations. [...] Doctors can also bring a patient out of anesthesia just as quickly, should complications arise during surgery. [...] The middle two classes of barbiturates are often combined under the title [...] "short/intermediate-acting." [...] These barbiturates are also employed for anesthetic purposes, and are also sometimes prescribed for anxiety or insomnia. [...] This is not a common practice anymore, however, owing to the dangers of long-term use of barbiturates; they have been replaced by the benzodiazepines for these purposes. [...] The final class of barbiturates are known as long-acting barbiturates (the most notable one being phenobarbital, which has a half-life of roughly 92 hours). [...] This class of barbiturates is used almost exclusively as anticonvulsants, although on rare occasions they are prescribed for daytime sedation. [...] Barbiturates in this class are not used for insomnia, because, owing to their extremely long half-life, patients would awake with a residual [...] "hang-over" [...] effect and feel groggy.|$|E

40|$|Our {{previous}} studies (1) {{have shown that}} demethylation is an important mechanism in the in vivo inactivation of 1 -methyl- 5, 5 -diethyl-barbituric acid. Since the higher N-alkyl derivatives of barbital are also quite active as narcotics and since the anesthesia is of relatively short duration, it was of interest to investigate {{the extent to which}} dealkylation was responsible for this short action. We have been able to find no reports of studies of the metabolic fate of any N-substituted <b>barbituric</b> <b>acids</b> other than the N-methyl compounds. Some of the simpler N-substituted barbitals have been prepared by Dox and lljort (2) and by Hjort and Dox (3). These included the methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, and phenyl derivatives.

40|$|The {{coordination}} chemistry of arylhydrazones of <b>barbituric</b> <b>acids</b> (AHBAs) {{is still a}} little explored area of research, notwithstanding their interesting chemical and structural features. Thus, these compounds have several coordination modes with a high flexibility, can exist in various tautomeric forms involving hydrogen bonds and potentially {{can be used as}} a useful tool for the construction of supramolecular architectures. Coordination compounds with such ligands are known, most of them being copper complexes and a zinc complex.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{the current}} study was to compare the {{predictive}} performance of a mechanistically based model and an empirical artificial neural network (ANN) model to describe the relationship between the tissue-to-unbound plasma concentration ratios (Kpu's) of 14 rat tissues and the lipophilicity (LogP) of a series of nine 5 -nalkyl- 5 -ethyl <b>barbituric</b> <b>acids.</b> The mechanistic model comprised the water content, binding capacity, number of the binding sites, and binding association constant of each tissue. A backpropagation ANN with 2 hidden layers (33 neurons in the first layer, 9 neurons in the second) was used for the comparison. The network was trained by an algorithm with adaptive momentum and learning rate, programmed using the ANN Toolbox of MATLAB. The predictive performance of both models was evaluated using a leave-one-out procedure and computation of both the mean prediction error (ME, showing the prediction bias) and the mean squared prediction error (MSE, showing the prediction accuracy). The ME of the mechanistic model was 18 % (range, 20 to 57 %), indicating a tendency for overprediction; the MSE is 32 % (range, 6 to 104 %). The ANN had almost no bias: the ME was 2 % (range, 36 to 64 %) and had greater precision than the mechanistic model, MSE 18 % (range, 4 to 70 %).
