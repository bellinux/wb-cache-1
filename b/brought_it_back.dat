5|$|Following {{his death}} (which {{according}} to persistent but unfounded legend {{was caused by}} a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected, supported by only a few musicians including Ferruccio Busoni, Egon Petri and Kaikhosru Sorabji. From the late 1960s onwards, led by Raymond Lewenthal and Ronald Smith, many pianists have recorded his music and <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> into the repertoire.|$|E
5|$|When Hudson {{returned}} to Cleaveland, he found few settlers and no food to spare. He continued east on Lake Erie {{to the mouth}} of Cattaraugus Creek, a stream in Western New York. There, Hudson obtained food and <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to the settlement.|$|E
5|$|Ealdred had {{returned}} to England by 1055, and brought with him {{a copy of the}} Pontificale Romano-Germanicum, a set of liturgies, with him. An extant copy of this work, currently manuscript Cotton Vitellus E xii, has been identified as a copy owned by Ealdred. It appears likely that the Rule of Chrodegang, a continental set of ordinances for the communal life of secular canons, was introduced into England by Ealdred sometime before 1059. Probably he <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> from Germany, possibly in concert with Harold.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1917, the Argentines had to sharply curtail Rivadavias {{activities}} {{because of}} a fuel shortage, but they voyaged to the United States with the Argentine ambassador in 1918. Rivadavia then took on a load of gold bullion and <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to Argentina, docking in Puerto Belgrano on 23 September 1918. In December 1920, Rivadavia participated in ceremonies that marked the 400th anniversary {{of the discovery of}} the Strait of Magellan. On the 2nd, the ship called on Valparaíso in Chile; 25 days later, it took part in an international naval review. Two years later, Rivadavia was placed into reserve.|$|E
5|$|Raucher's novelization of his {{screenplay}} of {{the same}} name was released prior to the film's release and became a runaway bestseller, to the point that audiences lost {{sight of the fact that}} the book was based on the film and not vice versa. Though a pop culture phenomenon in the first half of the 1970s, the novelization went out of print and slipped into obscurity throughout the next two decades until a Broadway adaptation in 2001 <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> into the public light and prompted Barnes & Noble to acquire the publishing rights to the book.|$|E
5|$|The few {{men who had}} {{not been}} wounded because they were manning the ships during the battle were {{reinforced}} with three men who had suffered relatively minor wounds; they put ashore at a remote beach to dig for water. They found some and <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to the ships, although it sickened those who drank it. The two ships sailed through a storm for two days and nights; Alaminos, the pilot, then steered a course for Florida, where they found good drinking water, although they lost one man to the local Indians and another drank so much water that he died. The ships finally made port in Cuba, where Hernández de Cordóba wrote a report to Governor Velázquez describing the voyage, the cities, the plantations, and, most importantly, the discovery of gold. Hernández died soon after from his wounds. The two captured Maya survived the voyage to Cuba and were interrogated; they swore that there was abundant gold in Yucatán.|$|E

5|$|The {{issue of}} {{improving}} navigation along the Kentucky River was raised numerous times by Representative James Blue during the 1876 legislative session. Despite Blue's promises of manifold {{benefits to the}} state from such an investment, parsimonious legislators defeated a bill allocating funds for the improvements. The issue gained traction with some voters during the biennial legislative elections, however, which <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> {{to the floor in}} the 1878 session. Prompted by recommendations from the Kentucky River Navigation Convention in 1877, McCreary abandoned his typical fiscal conservatism and joined the calls for improvements along the river. In response, legislators passed a largely ineffective bill providing that, if funds could be raised through special taxes in districts along the river, the state would provide the funds to maintain the improvements.|$|E
5|$|The sailor {{offers to}} pay a reward, but Dupin is {{interested}} only in learning the circumstances behind the two murders. The sailor explains that he captured the orangutan while in Borneo and <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to Paris, but had trouble keeping it under control. When he saw the orangutan attempting to shave its face with his straight razor, imitating his morning grooming, it fled into the streets and reached the Rue Morgue, where it climbed up and into the house. The orangutan seized the mother by the hair and was waving the razor, imitating a barber; when she screamed in fear, it flew into a rage, ripped her hair out, slashed her throat, and strangled the daughter. The sailor climbed up the lightning rod {{in an attempt to}} catch the animal, and the two voices heard by witnesses belonged to it and to him. Fearing punishment by its master, the orangutan threw the mother's body out the window and stuffed the daughter into the chimney before fleeing.|$|E
5|$|Brun soon {{sold the}} team on, {{this time to}} Swiss {{financier}} Joachim Luhti, who <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> into Formula One for the 1989 season. The new Brabham BT58, powered by a Judd V8 engine (originally another of Jack Brabham's companies), was produced for the 1989 season. Italian driver Stefano Modena, who had driven for the team in the 1987 Australian Grand Prix in a one off drive for the team, drove alongside the more experienced Martin Brundle who was returning to Formula One after spending 1988 winning the World Sportscar Championship for Jaguar. Modena took the team's last podium: a third place at the Monaco Grand Prix (Brundle, who had only just scraped through pre-qualifying by 0.021 seconds before qualifying a brilliant 4th, had been running third but was forced to stop to replace a flat battery, finally finishing sixth). The team also {{failed to make the}} grid sometimes: Brundle failed to prequalify at the Canadian Grand Prix and the French Grand Prix. The team finished 9th in the Constructors' Championship {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

25|$|The Colt SAA {{has been}} offered in over 30 {{different}} calibers and various barrel lengths. Its overall appearance has remained consistent since 1873.

The revolver was popular with ranchers, lawmen, and outlaws alike, but as of the early 21st century, models are mostly bought by collectors and re-enactors. Its design has influenced the production of numerous other models from other companies.|$|E

25|$|The {{prototype}} {{was used}} by the Norwegian Army fighting German forces in the Norwegian Campaign in 1940. This specific weapon was issued to Sergeant Håkon Lunde on 14 April 1940 when he was mobilized at Raufoss, and he carried it for several days before hiding it in Oslo.

25|$|In December 629, {{on the eve}} of the Conquest of Mecca, Muhammad sent Al-Zubayr and Ali to {{intercept}} a spy who was carrying a letter to the Quraysh.

The spy then produced the letter, which she had hidden in her hair, and Al-Zubayr and Ali <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to Muhammad, confident that the Muslims would now take Mecca by surprise.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, Pavlo Virsky and Mykola Bolotov {{founded the}} State Folk Dance Ensemble of the Ukrainian SSR, {{with the goal}} of {{elevating}} folk-stage dance to its highest artistic level, and solidifying it as a viable stage art form. Although the group was disbanded during the Second World War, Lydia Chereshnova (who had directed the Ukrainian Song and Dance Ensemble entertaining troops during the war) <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> into existence in 1951. After Vakhtang Vronsky of the Odessa Opera Theatre directed for a few seasons, Pavlo Virsky returned as artistic director of the State Folk Dance Ensemble of the Ukrainian SSR from 1955 until his death in 1975. During this twenty-year period, Pavlo Virsky demonstrated tremendous creativity in his choreography and propelled Ukrainian Folk-Stage Dance to a world-renowned level.|$|E

25|$|C/N 4519 - {{to display}} by the Amicale du Super Constellation {{located at the}} Nantes Airport in Nantes, France. It was {{delivered}} to Air France on November 2, 1953, and was upgraded to a L-1049 G in 1956, serving until August 8, 1967, having totaled 24,284 hours under Air France's colors. After retirement, it was sent to Spain, to be registered EC-BEN, briefly flying humanitarian and medevac missions in Biafra. Aero Fret bought it in 1968, <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> home to France, registered it as F-BRAD, and operated it on cargo hauls until 1974. When the Constellation landed in Nantes one last time to be scrapped, it was ultimately saved by Mr. Gaborit, who revamped it somewhat by his own modest means to finally park it near the terminal, accessible to visitors for a few years, until the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Nantes-Atlantique Airport bought it, to contract the Amicale du Super Constellation to undergo a complete restoration of the old aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In the Postclassic Popul Vuh of the K'iche' Maya of {{highland}} Guatemala, {{dogs and}} turkeys killed {{the people of}} the second age in retaliation for the people beating them. The people who escaped this fate were transformed into monkeys. Another account in the Popol Vuh describes the Hero twins sacrificing a dog that belonged to the Lords of the Underworld, also known as Xibalba. After the dog was dead, the Hero Twins <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to life. The Lords were so impressed that they asked the twins to sacrifice and resurrect them. In the end, the Hero Twins sacrificed the Lords of Xibalba and did not follow through on bringing them back to life. This made it possible for humans to live on earth. The story linked dogs with renewal and human life. Dogs are associated with death and have the job of leading people into the Underworld. They represent fire and are protectors of the hearth, two components of Maya life.|$|E
25|$|In that version, Set held {{a banquet}} for Osiris {{in which he}} brought in a {{beautiful}} box and said that whoever could fit in the box perfectly would get to keep it.

Once it was Osiris's turn to see if he could fit in the box, Set closed the lid on him so that the box was now a coffin for Osiris. Set flung the box in the Nile so that it would drift far away. Isis went looking for the box so that Osiris could have a proper burial. She found the box in a tree in Byblos, a city along the Phoenician coast, and <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> to Egypt, hiding it in a swamp. But Set went hunting that night and found the box. Enraged, Set chopped Osiris's body into fourteen pieces and scattered them all over Egypt to ensure that Isis could never find Osiris again for a proper burial.|$|E
