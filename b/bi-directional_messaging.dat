50|$|FOX {{offers a}} {{transparent}} <b>bi-directional</b> <b>messaging</b> system. Each widget sends its message {{to a certain}} target. Each message is composed by a selector that identifies its kind and an id that is unique and provided by the widget's enumeration. The advantage is that each widget can call a target widget's method in a transparent manner, even if the method does not exist. Vice versa, {{in the implementation of}} the individual message handler, since the sender is known, the target can also dispatch a message to the sender. This is a particularly important feature in component oriented software, where components may be written by different people, or even different organizations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{diagnose}} hypertension, multiple {{blood pressure}} (BP) measurements are recommended. We randomized patients into three groups: EMR–only (patients recorded BP measurements in an {{electronic medical record}} [EMR] web portal), EMR + reminders (patients were sent text message reminders to record their BP measurements in the EMR), and <b>bi–directional</b> text <b>messaging</b> (patients were sent a text message asking them to respond with their current BP). Subjects {{were asked to complete}} 14 measurements. Automated messages were sent to each patient in the <b>bi–directional</b> text <b>messaging</b> and EMR + reminder groups twice daily. Among 121 patients, those in the <b>bi–directional</b> text <b>messaging</b> group reported the full 14 measurements more often than both the EMR–only group (P < . 001) and the EMR + reminders group (P = . 038). Also, the EMR + reminders group outperformed the EMR–only group (P < . 001). <b>Bi–directional</b> automated text <b>messaging</b> is an effective way to gather patient BP data. Text–message–based reminders alone are an effective way to encourage patients to record BP measurements...|$|R
40|$|Haptic {{interfaces}} {{have been}} recently introduced in interaction systems, given the technological advances of haptic devices {{in the last}} decade. In haptic communication the user and the system exchange <b>bi-directional</b> <b>messages</b> perceived and generated by the human as continuous, while the system develops its processes on an event based, discrete in time mechanism. In this paper, we describe our study aiming at defining a model considering and coordinating both human continuity and machine discreteness. Haptic messages are in se very poor. Some experiments suggest their use combined with visual messages. To this end, we extend a recently proposed model for visual HCI to encompass haptic interaction as a primary channel of communication, used in parallel to the visual one. We also derive some hypotheses on how to explore the communication capabilities of coordinated visual and haptic technologies...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronic}} transfer {{of public health}} data involves the ability to securely and automatically send and receive information between computer systems, to achieve a 2 ̆ 01 clive 2 ̆ 01 d network for data exchange between partners in public health, i. e. the Public Health Information Network (PHIN). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advanced a standards-based approach to secure, reliable, <b>bi-directional</b> <b>message</b> transport across the Internet. The resulting Public Health Information Network (PHIN) specification calls for ebXML messaging on top of SOAP web services, XML Encryption, XML Digital Signature, and SSL authentication using client side certificates and/or passwords. The use of these industry standard specifications ensures that public health data is securely, reliably and automatically sent and received between health data systems. To effectively exchange information, both sending and receiving parties must adhere to the same specifications. This provides guidance of how to implement systems that securely send and receive public health data. OtherCurren...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we derive the {{capacity}} of the de-terministic relay networks with relay messages. We consider a network which consists of five nodes, four of which can only communicate via the fifth one. However, the fifth node is not merely a relay as it may exchange private messages with the other network nodes. First, we develop an upper bound on {{the capacity}} region based on the notion of a single sided genie. In the course of the achievability proof, we also derive the deterministic capacity of a 4 -user relay network (without private messages at the relay). The capacity achieving schemes use a combination of two network coding techniques: the Simple Ordering Scheme (SOS) and Detour Schemes (DS). In the SOS, we order the transmitted bits at each user such that the <b>bi-directional</b> <b>messages</b> will be received at the same channel level at the relay, while the basic idea behind the DS is that some parts of the message follow an indirect path to their respective destinations. This paper, therefore, serves to show that user cooperation and network coding can enhance throughput, even when the users are not directly connected to each other.

40|$|In {{broadcast}} environments, maintaining global serializability for all {{transactions in}} mobile clients and database server is expensive and inefficient. On the one hand, not all mobile commerce applications require {{such a high}} degree of data consistency as serializability. On the other hand, the mechanism of conventional concurrency control protocols designed for distributed database systems need a significant amount of bandwidth for <b>bi-directional</b> <b>message</b> passing. This kind of message passing is not desirable in the broadcast environment where communication between mobile clients and the server is asymmetric. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to processing mobile read-only transactions (ROTs) in the broadcast environment by using separate algorithms for ROTs and allowing non-serializable schedules. Firstly, the NRS-Algorithm is proposed to relax the serializability for a single mobile read-only transaction with respect to update transactions executing concurrently at the server. Then two different views of data consistency are introduced and the NRS-Algorithm is extended to two new algorithms for processing ROTs separately under these two views. Update Consistency View allows non-serializable schedules for ROTs, but requires them to perceive the same serializable view produced by update transactions at the server. Global Serializable View allows only serializable schedules as required by the serializability. The performance of both algorithms was examined through a series of simulation experiments. The results showed that the proposed algorithms are effective...|$|R
40|$|Mobile phone {{technology}} (mHealth) is {{a promising}} tool {{that has been}} used to improve HIV care in high-riskpopulations worldwide. Understanding patient perspectives of newly diagnosed {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) in Lima, Peru during linkage and engagement in the HIV care continuum can help close the gaps in care following initial HIV diagnosis and ensure retention in continuous care. From June 2015 to March 2016, as part of a randomized controlled trial, 40 MSM participants were linked to care with an mHealth intervention within 3 months of HIV diagnosis at Via Libre clinic. For 12 weeks, participants agreed to receive weekly predetermined, standardized short message service (SMS), WhatsApp, and/or Facebook messages from an assigned HIV counselor. Text <b>messaging</b> was <b>bi-directional,</b> meaning participants could also send messages to their counselor at any time. In this qualitative study, we coded and thematically analyzed 947 SMS, 918 WhatsApp, and 2, 694 Facebook <b>bi-directional</b> <b>messages.</b> Mean age of participants was 29. 8 years (20 – 50); with 70 percent reporting some post-high school education and 73 percent self-identifying as homosexual. We identified six recurring themes that emerged from the data: (a) mental health symptoms; (b) coping behaviors; (c) interpersonal support; (d) physical symptoms; (e) HIV knowledge; and (f) care coordination. Participants sent text messages describing depressive symptoms and seeking mental health services during this initial stage of HIV care. For newly diagnosed MSM entering the HIV care continuum, a bi-directional mHealth intervention provided support to facilitate care while eliciting deeply personal mental and emotional states. Future interventions could benefit from using mHealth interventions as ancillary support for clinicians...|$|R
40|$|In {{wireless}} communication systems, relays {{are widely used}} to extend coverage. Over the past years, relays have evolved from simple repeaters to more sophisticated units that perform signal processing to improve signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) or throughput (or both) at the destination receiver. There are various types of relays such as amplify and forward (AF), decode and forward (DF), and compress and forward (CF) (or estimate and forward (EF)) relays. In addition, recently {{there has been a}} growing interest in two-way relays (TWR). By utilizing the concept of analog network coding (ANC), TWRs can improve the throughput of a wireless sys- tem by reducing the number of time slots needed to complete a <b>bi-directional</b> <b>message</b> exchange between two destination nodes. It?s well known that the performance of a TWR system greatly depends on its ability to apply signal processing techniques to effectively mitigate the self-interference and noise accumulation, thereby improving the SINR. We study a TWR system that is equipped with multiple antennas at the relay node and a single antenna at the two destination nodes. Different from traditional work on TWR, we focus on the case with imperfect knowledge of channel state information (CSI). For such a TWR, we formulate a robust optimization problem that takes into ac- count norm-bounded estimation errors in CSI and designs an optimal beamforming matrix. Realizing the fact that this problem is extremely hard to solve globally, we derive two different methods to obtain either optimal or efficient suboptimal beam- forming matrix solutions. The first method involves solving the robust optimization problem using the S-procedure and semidefinite programming (SDP) with rank-one relaxation. This method provides an optimal solution when the rank-one relaxation condition for the SDP is satisfied. In cases where the rank-one condition cannot be satisfied, it?s necessary to resort to sub-optimal techniques. The second approach presented here reformulates the robust non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) into a robust linear programming (LP) problem by using first-order perturbation of the optimal non-robust beamforming solution (which assumes no channel estimation error). Finally, we view the TWR robust beamforming problem from a practical standpoint and develop a set of iterative algorithms based on Newton?s method or the steepest descent method that are practical for hardware implementation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} obstacles Web Services have to overcome in the attempt to exploit the true potential of the World Wide Web is heterogeneity. Caused {{by the nature of the}} Web itself, heterogeneity problems occur both at data level as well as at behavioral level of business logics, message exchange protocol and Web Service invocation. Process mediation is one of the crucial points on the road towards establishing new, ad-hoc cooperation on the web between various business partners. If semantic enhanced data enables dynamic solutions for coping with data heterogeneity, semantically enhanced Web Services can do the same for behavioral heterogeneity. Based on Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO) specifications that offers support in semantically describing Web Services, we propose a solution that acts on these semantic descriptions and offers the means for defining of what we call a Process Mediator. Such a mediator acts on the public processes (represented as WSMO choreographies) of the parties involved in a communication and adjust the <b>bi-directional</b> flow of <b>messages</b> to suit the requested/expected behavior of each party. ...|$|R
