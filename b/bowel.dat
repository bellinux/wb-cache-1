5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is defined}} as {{vomiting}} or diarrhea due to infection of the small or large <b>bowel.</b> The changes in the small <b>bowel</b> are typically noninflammatory, while {{the ones in the}} large <b>bowel</b> are inflammatory. The number of pathogens required to cause an infection varies from as few as one (for Cryptosporidium) to as many as 108 (for Vibrio cholerae).|$|E
5|$|Another {{common and}} {{potentially}} fatal complication of doxorubicin is typhlitis, an acute life-threatening {{infection of the}} <b>bowel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Crohn's {{disease is}} a type of {{inflammatory}} <b>bowel</b> disease (IBD) that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Signs and symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever, and weight loss. Other complications may occur outside the gastrointestinal tract and include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and tiredness. The skin rashes may be due to infections as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. <b>Bowel</b> obstruction also commonly occurs and those with the disease are at greater risk of <b>bowel</b> cancer.|$|E

5|$|Other {{potential}} {{causes of}} {{signs and symptoms}} that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis {{that need to be}} ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory <b>bowel</b> disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus. Pancreatic insufficiency, short <b>bowel</b> syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered. The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).|$|E
5|$|Bowel: <b>bowel</b> {{problems}} affect around 70% of {{the patients}}, with around 50% {{of the patients}} suffering from constipation and up to 30% from fecal incontinence. Cause of <b>bowel</b> impairments in MS patients is usually either a reduced gut motility or an impairment in neurological control of defecation. The former is commonly related to inmobility or secondary effects from drugs used {{in the treatment of}} the disease. Pain or problems with defecation can be helped with a diet change which includes among other changes an increased fluid intake, oral laxatives or suppositories and enemas when habit changes and oral measures are not enough to control the problems.|$|E
5|$|Lactulose and {{lactitol}} are disaccharides {{that are}} not absorbed from the digestive tract. They are thought to decrease the generation of ammonia by bacteria, render the ammonia inabsorbable by converting it to ammonium (NH4+) ions, and increase transit of <b>bowel</b> content through the gut. Doses of 15-30ml are administered three times a day; the result is aimed to be 3–5 soft stools a day, or (in some settings) a stool pH of <6.0. Lactulose may also be given by enema, especially if encephalopathy is severe. More commonly, phosphate enemas are used. This may relieve constipation, one {{of the causes of}} encephalopathy, and increase <b>bowel</b> transit.|$|E
50|$|When {{made into}} a tea with {{horsetail}} (Equisetum hyemale), it is claimed {{to be good for}} bleeding or ulcers of <b>bowels,</b> or for tumors and inflammation of the <b>bowels.</b> It {{has been used as a}} quick relief for nose bleeds and sore eyes. The fresh roots or leaves are simmered in milk; or the juice of the plant infused in apple cider; and these treatments are used for dropsy, hiccups, vomiting and bleeding of the <b>bowels.</b> Misuse may cause nausea or even vomiting.|$|R

5|$|Nonpathogenic E. coli strain Nissle 1917, {{also known}} as Mutaflor, and E. coli O83:K24:H31 (known as Colinfant) are used as {{probiotic}} agents in medicine, mainly {{for the treatment of}} various gastroenterological diseases, including inflammatory <b>bowel</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|People with {{schizophrenia}} {{may have}} {{a high rate of}} irritable <b>bowel</b> syndrome but they often do not mention it unless specifically asked. Psychogenic polydipsia, or excessive fluid intake in the absence of physiological reasons to drink, is relatively common in people with schizophrenia.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. <b>Bowel</b> and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the <b>bowel</b> and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of {{bacteria in the}} stomach may be beneficial, reducing the prevalence of asthma, rhinitis, dermatitis, inflammatory <b>bowel</b> disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and esophageal cancer by influencing systemic immune responses.|$|E
5|$|A {{concern for}} sexual {{activity}} that is not dangerous but that can be upsetting for both partners is bladder or <b>bowel</b> leakage due to urinary or fecal incontinence. Couples can prepare for sex by draining the bladder using intermittent catheterization or placing towels down in advance. People with indwelling urinary catheters must take special care with them, removing them or taping {{them out of the}} way.|$|E

5|$|Due to the breed's {{elongated}} body, {{there can}} be back problems within the breed, specifically with intervertebral discs in the dog's back. These discs can sometimes slip out of place, resulting in spinal disc herniation. Symptoms depend on {{what part of the}} dog's back is affected; they can include paralysis with loss of bladder and <b>bowel</b> control in the worst cases.|$|E

He accepts that {{he is not going to}} get a haircut, but also abandons all of his meticulous planning (for example, his <b>bowel</b> chart spreadsheet), realizing it has been a waste of time.|$|E
5|$|Surgery may {{be useful}} in those with a herniated disc that is causing {{significant}} pain radiating into the leg, significant leg weakness, bladder problems, or loss of <b>bowel</b> control. It may also be useful in those with spinal stenosis. In the absence of these issues, there is no clear evidence of a benefit from surgery.|$|E

5|$|The study {{demonstrated}} that two bacterial divisions, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, constitute over 90% {{of the known}} phylogenetic categories that dominate distal gut bacteria. Using the relative gene frequencies found within the gut these researchers identified 1,244 metagenomic clusters that are critically important {{for the health of}} the intestinal tract. There are two types of functions in these range clusters: housekeeping and those specific to the intestine. The housekeeping gene clusters are required in all bacteria and are often major players in the main metabolic pathways including central carbon metabolism and amino acid synthesis. The gut-specific functions include adhesion to host proteins and the harvesting of sugars from globoseries glycolipids. Patients with irritable <b>bowel</b> syndrome were shown to exhibit 25% fewer genes and lower bacterial diversity than individuals not suffering from irritable <b>bowel</b> syndrome indicating that changes in patients’ gut biome diversity may be associated with this condition.|$|E
5|$|Transient {{increased}} <b>bowel</b> frequency, diarrhoea, constipation or minor rectal bleeding, {{may also}} occur. Acute and subacute side effects usually resolve over {{a matter of}} days or a few weeks. In the case of permanent (seed) brachytherapy for prostate cancer, there is a small chance that some seeds may migrate out of the treatment region into the bladder or urethra and be passed in the urine.|$|E
25|$|Causes of <b>bowel</b> {{obstruction}} include adhesions, hernias, volvulus, endometriosis, inflammatory <b>bowel</b> disease, appendicitis, tumors, diverticulitis, ischemic <b>bowel,</b> tuberculosis, and intussusception. Small <b>bowel</b> obstructions {{are most}} often due to adhesions and hernias while large <b>bowel</b> obstructions {{are most often}} due to tumors and volvulus. The diagnosis may be made on plain X-rays; however, CT scan is more accurate. Ultrasound or MRI may help in the diagnosis of children or pregnant women.|$|E
