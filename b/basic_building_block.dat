Periphyton is the <b>basic</b> <b>building</b> <b>block</b> of marl, a calcitic mud. In areas with hydroperiods of longer than nine months, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Peat and marl are considered nutrient-poor soils that foster the growth of specialized vegetation depending on the length of the regional hydroperiod.|$|E

Nearly all life forms in the ocean depend on the photosynthetic activities of phytoplankton and other marine plants to convert carbon dioxide into organic carbon, which is the <b>basic</b> <b>building</b> <b>block</b> of organic matter. Photosynthesis in turn requires energy from sunlight to drive the chemical reactions that produce organic carbon.|$|E

It is also the <b>basic</b> <b>building</b> <b>block</b> of steroid hormones, including neurosteroids. In Niemann–Pick type C, large amounts of free or unesterified cholesterol accumulate in lysosomes, and leads to relative deficiency of this molecule in multiple membranes and for steroid synthesis. The accumulation of glycosphingolipids in the nervous system has been linked to structural changes, namely ectopic dendritogenesis and meganeurite formation, and has been targeted therapeutically.|$|E
