40|$|Abstract: Theoretical {{analysis}} of vibrations {{of a system}} in which the mass is connected with the support in series of more than one elastic element had shown that there is possibility to provoke additional resonances. Condition of it is change of damping values of the system near the supposed resonance frequency defined calculations. Feed mechanism of cylindrical grinding machine of older design was researched from that point of view. The mechanism consists of chain of elastic elements in series connecting the wheelhead with the <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> <b>machine.</b> Large friction forces exist in the chains of elements and in the wheelhead ways. Analysis results are presented in the paper...|$|E

40|$|The current {{trend in}} the machine tools market is to produce <b>machines</b> capable <b>of</b> faster cutting speeds. The level of {{vibration}} in a machine tool has always influenced the accuracy, both dimensional and geometrical, <b>of</b> the product <b>machined.</b> Increasing structural stiffness could help in avoiding these problems. Alternate materials which could increase the structural stiffness while enhancing other characteristics including damping simultaneously {{should be used for}} machine tool structures. On the other hand, epoxy composite has exceptional damping characteristics. In this work, the <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> the Vertical <b>Machining</b> Center was considered for modifications to enhance both its stiffness and damping characteristics. Finite element analysis (FEA) was also carried out for standard dimensions of hybrid samples of different steel face thicknesses. Static and modal analysis were carried out for the hybrid samples. From the results of the analysis the optimum thickness of the steel face for the bed is determined as 1. 5 mm. The <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> Vertical <b>Machining</b> Center (VMC) was modeled using Pro/E and the finite element analysis <b>of</b> the <b>bed</b> was carried out. Static and modal analyses <b>of</b> the <b>bed</b> were carried out using ANSYS. The hybrid samples containing epoxy concrete core and steel face were fabricated. From the experimental results the damping factor of hybrid samples is calculated as 0. 45 which is higher than the damping factor of cast iron (damping factor = 0. 2) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{presser foot}} is an {{attachment}} used with sewing machines to hold fabric flat {{as it is}} fed through the machine and stitched. Sewing machines have feed dogs in the <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>machine</b> to provide traction and move the fabric as it is fed through the machine, while the sewer provides extra support for the fabric by guiding it with one hand. A presser foot keeps the fabric flat {{so that it does}} not rise and fall with the needle and pucker as it is stitched. When especially thick workpieces are to be sewn, such as quilts, a specialized attachment called a walking foot is often used rather than a presser foot.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} basic types of bending on a press brake, each {{is defined by}} the {{relationship}} of the end tool position to the thickness of the material. These three are Air Bending, Bottoming and Coining. The configuration of the tools for these three types of bending are nearly identical. A die with a long rail form tool with a radiused tip that locates the inside profile of the bend is called a punch. Punches are usually attached to the ram <b>of</b> the <b>machine</b> by clamps and move to produce the bending force. A die with a long rail form tool that has concave or V shaped lengthwise channel that locate the outside profile of the form is called a die. Dies are usually stationary and located under the material on the <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>machine.</b> Note that some locations do not differentiate between the two different kinds of dies (punches and dies.) The other types of bending listed use specially designed tools or machines to perform the work.|$|R

The knitted fabrics developed have a relatively large thickness {{in relation to the}} needle pitch and distance between the needle <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> the knitting <b>machine</b> on which they were formed. The effect described was obtained by combining three knitted layers with the use of different reports and the number of monofilament threads knitted-in, and by modifying the knitted layers with elastomer threads. The distance knitted fabrics designed and produced for potential use as preforms for composites and parts protecting against an impact were tested and analysed with respect to their structural parameters...|$|R

The mole stretches out several hundred yards {{on that side of the}} entrance of the port which is next the sea. Here signals are regularly made to acquaint vessels in the offing with the precise number of feet that can be brought into the port. These signals are changed at the rise or fall of every foot, according to a graduated scale which is near the signal pole. At dead low water the entrance to the harbour, and the outer harbour itself, are merely <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> soft mud. <b>Machines</b> are kept constantly at work to deepen them.|$|R
40|$|Inaccuracies in the {{selective}} laser sintering (SLS) process using polymer materials are typically caused by inhomogeneous shrinkage due to inhomogeneous temperature distribution in the powder <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> the SLS <b>machine.</b> These shrinking effects lead to stress in the sintered parts, causing the part to distort. The inhomogeneous shrinkage of benchmark parts has been compensated empirically in a former work. The results cannot been transferred to all geometries, because each geometry requires a specific temperature for laser sintering and, thus, has its own related shrinkage distribution. In a new theoretical approach, shrinkage behavior is to be integrated in a thermal simulation of the SLS process and the thermal shrinkage calculated prior to the building process. In the following, experimental data of the temperature- and pressure-dependent shrinkage of laser-sintered powder samples is presented. Possible theories for a physical model of thermal shrinkage are discussed. In particular, these models have to consider granular characteristics such as internal friction, particle sliding, and powder compaction...|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of a series <b>of</b> packed <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> non-equilateral cylindrical particles has been investigated and compared with those <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> spheres and equilateral cylinders of similar dimensions. It is found that the mean voidage <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> equilateral cylinders is consistently lower than the corresponding values for <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> spheres and non-equilateral cylinders of aspect ratios 0. 25, 0. 5, 2 and 3. End effects {{do not appear to}} be present in <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> cylinders of aspect ratios of 0. 25 and 0. 5 and generally, both wall and end effects are significantly weaker than corresponding effects in <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> spheres and equilateral cylinders. This suggests that chanelling is reduced in <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> non-equilateral cylindrical pellets. Whilst the axial voidage distribution <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> non-equilateral cylinders appears to be almost uniform, the radial voidage distribution bears the effect of confining walls and an oscillatory profile is observed in most cases, but is seen to be irregular for aspect ratios 0. 25 and 0. 5. The orientation effect of particles of aspect ratio 0. 25 in adjacent layers causes an irregular pattern in the axially averaged radial voidage distribution. Observed axially averaged radial voidage profiles suggest that a uniform structure may be achieved by modifying the basic cylindrical shape. 1...|$|R
