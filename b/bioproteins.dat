40|$|Abstract: <b>Bioprotein</b> {{production}} {{is one of}} the most promising breakthroughs of biotechnological innovations. Due to its increasing demand, the efficient strains, substrate and method must be used for high yield product. In this study, screening of five different cerivisiea, Mucor hiemalis and Thricoderma harzianum, was done for <b>bioprotein</b> production by liquid state bioconversion of wheat flour as a cheaper carbon source. Bioconversion was done with fixed wheat flour concentration of 2 % (w/v) at a temperature 27 °C, agitation of 150 rpm with 2 % inoculum (106 spores mL¯ 1). Biomass production was recorded continuously for six days and the protein content was also determined every day. From the observed results, Mucor hiemalis was found to be the most potential strain with biomass of about 11. 48 g L¯ 1 on the fourth day of treatment. With this promising result, the amount of <b>bioprotein</b> was further increased to 21. 89 g L¯ 1 by optimizing few process factors. Further optimization developments are in progress.

STAT- 3 is a transcription factor associated with cell proliferation. We hypothesized that silencing of STAT- 3 by siRNA will inhibit proliferation of VSMCs and attenuate intimal thickening. Methods: Rat VSMCs were isolated and cultured in vitro by applying tissue piece inoculation methods. VSMCs were transfected with STAT 3 siRNA using lipofectamine 2000. In vitro proliferation of VSMC was quantified by the MTT assay, while in vivo assessment was performed in a venous transplantation model.

Although the fastest decomposition of white KB biomass occurs at about 300  °C (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1), but a temperature of 350  °C {{was chosen as the}} first-step carbonization temperature in order to exceed the decomposition temperature of tyrosine (344  °C), the highest among the amino acids in <b>bioprotein.</b> KB 350 and zinc chloride (ZnCl 2) were mechanically mixed by ball-milling at 500  rpm according to mass ratio of 1 : 1.

40|$|A {{strain of}} a novel mucoralean fungus was {{isolated}} from a nest of the invasive paper wasp, Polistes dominulus. Phylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and 5. 8 S rRNA gene sequences, along with physiological tests, revealed that this strain represents a novel species within the genus Mucor. The novel species also includes a representative {{that had previously been}} characterized as part of the Mucor hiemalis complex. Unlike the type strain of M. hiemalis, these two strains can grow at 37 6 C and sporulate at 35 6 C. Here, we present a partial resolution of the M. hiemalis species complex and propose the novel species Mucor nidicola sp. nov. to accommodate the isolate; the type strain of M. nidicola is F 53 T (5 NRRL 54520 T 5 UAMH 11442 T 5 CBS 130359 T). Paper wasps are nearly globally distributed insects that create nests of macerated cellulose pulp, foraged by wasps from leaves, grass, cardboard and decomposing plant matter (Evans & West-Eberhard, 1970). Because of the ubiquity of fungal saprophytes in decomposing plant matter (reviewed by Ribes et al., 2000), {{it is not surprising that}} multipleMucor species have been isolated in the few mycobiota assessments conducted on paper wasp nest material (Jayaprakash & Ebenezer, 2010; Fouillaud &Morel, 1995).

Workers in this industry suffer frequently from pulmonary and systemic symptoms which may be induced by an inflammatory reaction. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the effect of BSCP on inflammation in vitro as evaluated by complement activation and cytokine production. Human serum was incubated with BSCP and complement activation products specific for all pathways were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Human whole blood anti-coagulated with lepirudin was incubated with BSCP and a panel of 27 biological mediators was measured using multiplex technology. BSCP induced a dose-dependent complement activation as revealed by a pronounced increase in alternative and terminal pathway activation (fivefold and 20 -fold, respectively) at doses from 1 µg BSCP/ml serum and a similar, but less extensive (two- to fourfold) increase in activation of the lectin and classical pathways at doses from 100 and 1000 µg BSCP/ml serum, respectively. Similarly, BSCP induced a dose-dependent production of a number of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in human whole blood. At doses as low as 0 · 05 – 0 · 5 µg BSCP/ml blood a substantial increase was seen for tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -α, interleukin (IL) - 1 -β, IL- 6, interferon (IFN) -γ, IL- 8, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) - 1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) - 1 α, MIP- 1 β, IL- 4, IL- 9, IL- 17, IL- 1 Ra, granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
