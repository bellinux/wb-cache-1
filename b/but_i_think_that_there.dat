60|$|In this a great {{subject is}} {{discussed}} {{which would be}} too long for these pages; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> now exists a feeling that literature can herself, for herself, produce a rank as effective as any that a Queen's minister can bestow.

And as for pay and pension, the less the better of it for any profession, unless so far as it may be payment made for work done. Then the higher the payment the better, in literature as in all other trades. It may be doubted even whether a special rank of its own be good for literature, such as that which is achieved by the happy possessors of the forty chairs of the Academy in France. Even though they had an angel to make the choice,--which they have not,--that angel would do more harm to the excluded than good to the selected.|$|E
6000|$|We {{descended from}} Mount Tabor, crossed a deep ravine, {{followed}} a hilly, rocky road to Nazareth--distant two hours. All distances in the East are measured by hours, not miles. A good horse will walk three {{miles an hour}} over nearly {{any kind of a}} road; therefore, an hour, here, always stands for three miles. This method of computation is bothersome and annoying; and until one gets thoroughly accustomed to it, it carries no intelligence to his mind until he has stopped and translated the pagan hours into Christian miles, just as people do with the spoken words of a foreign language they are acquainted with, but not familiarly enough to catch the meaning in a moment. Distances traveled by human feet are also estimated by hours and minutes, though I do not know what the base of the calculation is. In Constantinople you ask, [...] "How far is it to the Consulate?" [...] and they answer, [...] "About ten minutes." [...] "How far is it to the Lloyds' Agency?" [...] "Quarter of an hour." [...] "How far is it to the lower bridge?" [...] "Four minutes." [...] I can not be positive about it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there,</b> when a man orders a pair of pantaloons, he says he wants them a quarter of a minute in the legs and nine seconds around the waist.|$|E

Wood is an awful price here, and all that is used has to be brought up from the coast. I think therefore of planting trees. The climate is magnificent, and their growth will be rapid. They will of course require fencing to keep out the cattle, but I shall do that, as I am doing the orchard, with wire fencing and light iron-uprights. Labour is plentiful, and there are large nurseries near Pieter-Maritzburg, where I can procure any number of young trees; so I mean to plant 200 acres a year--in ten years the whole farm will be planted, and the loppings for poles and firewood will {{in a very short time}} after planting begin to pay well. In fifteen years the first 200 acres will be fit to fell, and the property will be worth a very large sum of money. Of course we can sell out before that if we like. But at the present price of wood up here, or even should it fall to a quarter of its present price, the value of the 2000 acres of wood will in twenty years be extremely large." ...|$|E
60|$|I fancy {{that the}} author rather dislikes Candida {{because it is so}} {{generally}} liked. I give my own feeling for what it is worth (a foolish phrase), <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were only two moments when this powerful writer was truly, in the ancient and popular sense, inspired; that is, breathing from a bigger self and telling more truth than he knew. One is that scene in a later play where after the secrets and revenges of Egypt have rioted and rotted all round him, the colossal sanity of CÃ¦sar is suddenly acclaimed with swords. The other is that great last scene in Candida where the wife, stung into final speech, declared her purpose of remaining with the strong man because he is the weak man. The wife is asked to decide between two men, one a strenuous self-confident popular preacher, her husband, the other a wild and weak young poet, logically futile and physically timid, her lover; and she chooses the former because he has more weakness and more need of her. Even among the plain and ringing paradoxes of the Shaw play {{this is one of the}} best reversals or turnovers ever effected. A paradoxical writer like Bernard Shaw is perpetually and tiresomely told that he stands on his head. But all romance and all religion consist in making the whole universe stand on its head. That reversal is the whole idea of virtue; that the last shall be first and the first last. Considered as a pure piece of Shaw therefore, the thing is of the best. But it is also something much better than Shaw. The writer touches certain realities commonly outside his scope; especially the reality of the normal wife's attitude to the normal husband, an attitude which is not romantic but which is yet quite quixotic; which is insanely unselfish and yet quite cynically clear-sighted. It involves human sacrifice without in the least involving idolatry.|$|E
60|$|I {{am afraid}} {{it was late}} before Mrs. Ray went to sleep that night, and I almost doubt whether Rachel slept at all. It {{seemed to her that}} in the present {{condition}} of her life sleep could hardly be necessary. During the last month past she had envied those who slept while she was kept awake by her sorrow. She had often struggled to sleep as she sat in her chair, so that she might escape for a few moments from the torture of her waking thoughts. But why need she sleep now that every thought was a new pleasure? There was no moment that she had ever passed with him that had not to be recalled. There was no word of his that had not to be re-weighed. She remembered, or fancied that she remembered, her idea of the man when her eye first fell upon his outside form. She would have sworn that her first glance of him had conveyed to her far more than had ever come to her from many a day's casual looking at any other man. She could almost believe that he had been specially made and destined for her behoof. She blushed even while lying in bed as she remembered how the gait of the man, and the tone of his voice, had taken possession of her eyes and ears from the first day on which she had met him. When she had gone to Mrs. Tappitt's party, so consciously alive {{to the fact that he}} was to be there, she had told herself that she was sure she thought no more of him than of any other man that she might meet; but she now declared to herself that she had been a weak fool in thus attempting to deceive herself; that she had loved him from the first,--or at any rate from that evening when he had told her of the beauty of the clouds; and that from that day to the present hour there had been no other chance of happiness to her but that chance which had now been so wondrously decided in her favour. When she came down to breakfast on the next morning she was very quiet,--so quiet that her sister almost thought she was frightened at her future prospects; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no such fear. She was so happy that she could afford to be tranquil in her happiness.|$|E

5000|$|Joe Boyd, {{responsible}} for the sound mixing at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, {{said in an interview}} with Richie Unterberger in 2007: [...] "I think there were a lot of people who were upset about the rock band, but I think it was pretty split.

40|$|A. Uncertainty: The {{requirements}} {{to characterize the}} key uncertainties and to perform quantitative probabilistic uncertainty analysis of rules involving costs over $ 1 billion are welcome. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is more {{that needs to be}} said here. Specifically, I recommend that you add a paragraph explicitly criticizing the practice of combining two or more conservative assumptions in the calculation of an âAlternative Estimateâof benefits, as has been done by EPA, for example in its economic assessment of the Clean Skies Initiative. By incorporating at least three conservative assumptions in one calculation, the Agency has produced an estimate of benefits that has a very low probability of being true. Or to put it differently, the Agency has focused on the uncertainties on the down side to the virtual exclusion of the uncertainties on the upside, thus producing a biased picture of the true uncertainty in the estimation of benefits. A formal probabilistic analysis of the uncertainties in the Base Estimate would almost certainly result in an upper bound that is higher than the Alternative Estimate. The Guidelines should explicitly rule out this approach to characterizing uncertainties. B.

40|$|I {{would like}} to take up Anna Gelpernâs {{invitation}} to define the study of Law and Development broadly and to reject the presumption that the inquiry will focus narrowly on the law-related projects of bilateral aid agencies and international organizations. I am interested in the relationship between law on the one hand and, on the other hand, development (however defined), and it is not clear to me that externally directed âLaw and Developmentâ projects are always central to understanding that relationship. (Isnât that a reasonable inference to draw from all of the studies that question the impact of those projects?) Donât get me wrong, I think it is often crucially important to take foreign actors into account when trying to understand where the âlawâ part of the equation comes from, as well as what factors besides law might be influencing development. But I am skeptical of the notion that foreign actors are always central to the story, especially in some of the larger developing countries; do we really understand the legal systems of Brazil, India, and China best by focusing on the components influenced by the World Bank and the IMF? As far as the future of Law and Development is concerned, I believe that it will and should involve becoming even more of a social science. I also believe, however, that the contributions to this Symposium have identified many of the pitfalls that lie in that direction. To begin with, there are obviously methodological questions about what empirical methods are best suited to uncovering the kinds of causal relationships between law and social outcomes we are looking for and theoretical questions about what legal and social variables ought to be measured. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are even more profound questions to be asked about the entire enterprise, especially if the purpose is to give policymakers insights into âwhat works. ...|$|E
40|$|What is {{the place}} of social and {{economic}} guarantees in a democratic constitutional order? Do such guarantees place a special strain on the judiciary? Do they help poor people? What is the relationship between such guarantees and doctrines involving state action and the horizontal application of constitutional norms? Mark Tushnet does not attempt to answer these questions directly. But he casts new light on them by analyzing a number of cases in which courts have, or have not, taken their constitutions to alter background rules of property, contract, and tort. Tushnet contends that the rise of the activist state, understood as some form of social democracy, unsettles preexisting understandings of the relationship between constitutional norms and the private sector. In the classical liberal state, the constitution does not apply horizontally; there are no economic guarantees; and what counts as state action is relatively clear. But once the state assumes 2 Ì 2 affirmative obligations, 2 Ì 2 constitutional norms might well be triggered, and the state 2 Ì 7 s failure to alter the background rules of property and contract law might well raise serious constitutional problems. To borrow from Tushnet 2 Ì 7 s summary of his complex account: In a 2 Ì 2 thin social democratic nation, 2 Ì 2 such as Canada, courts are placed in a new and extremely difficult position, being forced either to 2 Ì 2 enforce obviously arbitrary lines between what they treat as state action and what they do not, 2 Ì 2 or to work out 2 Ì 2 the set of entitlements people should have in a thicker social democracy. 2 Ì 2 Much of what Tushnet says is highly illuminating, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are several gaps in his discussion. I emphasize two points here. First, the classical liberal state assumes affirmative obligations, and does so no less than the social democratic state. The obligations are different, but they are not less affirmative. The widespread neglect of this point, within the legal and political culture, has led to serious failures in analysis, and the failures are not innocuous. Second, state action is always present. The constitutional question, in any system that has a state action requirement, is not whether there is state action, but whether the relevant state action is unconstitutional. That is a hard question on the merits, {{but it is not a}} hard state action question. A thin social democracy may struggle with constitutional issues, but by virtue of its status as a thin social democracy, it ought not to have any special struggle with questions involving state action or horizontal effect. A nation that currently embraces social democracy might create, at the constitutional level, social and economic rights, or it might not. A nation that currently rejects social democracy might offer, at the constitutional level, social and economic rights, or it might not. The legal questions involve the merits. [CONT...|$|E
40|$|Using modern {{information}} and communication technologies Suggested introduction: When did you last use a computer? What were you using it for? Maybe you have never used one and don?t feel you need to. For most people who have started using computers in the last ten years, probably the most popular service that computers offer is email. For sending messages to family, friends and colleagues, email can be the quickest and most reliable method. Computers can also be a valuable source of information, allowing users to search for up-to-date news, weather reports, health or even market information, through the internet. Interestingly however, research suggests that far fewer people use computers as a source of information, certainly compared to the number who use email. The reason? Perhaps the expense of paying for time online, or not knowing how to search for the right information. And many of us are simply unaware of what useful information might be available, and continue to rely on other sources, such as TV, radio, newspapers and friends. Faye Durrant, Professor of Library and Information studies at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica believes strongly that computer-based technologies have a lot to offer, not just to highly skilled professionals, but also to rural people making a living from agriculture and other local industries. At a recent conference in Belize, she, and other participants, discussed the power of these technologies for rural development; afterwards, they spoke to Susanna Thorp about their own experiences. IN:		?Well certainly in terms of the uptake? OUT:	?the information that they require. DUR?N		 5 ? 59 ? Back announcement: Thomas Burton ending that report on the current usage of ICTs - Information and Communication Technologies - for rural development in the Caribbean. Transcript Durrant	Well certainly in terms of the uptake of the Internet that is increasing daily. So I think {{that is one of the}} ways in which we can get a large region like this, one point on the Internet can be accessible to everybody in the whole region. Thorp	But for vulnerable groups this presumably is not something that they necessarily can access particularly on an individual level? Durrant	What has been happening and certainly in Jamaica is the development of tele centres via the public library system where there are public access computers which people can go in and use for this kind of information without having to have their own dedicated computer. Thorp	And what about the introduction of these things, these technologies in schools that the children are learning at the new generation? Durrant	Yes certainly that is where the children are catching on very fast to the whole facility of email and searching for information on the web. What we want to ensure is that when they search they can find a spot where they have reliable information that will give them the basis for long term decision making on their diet and the way in which they develop their own personal nutrition strategies. Thorp	Because there isn?t a lack of information, it is actually people knowing where to go to find it? Durrant	Exactly and even having it in the form because now children want multimedia, they don?t want any ten pages of text telling them something. They want something that jumps out at them and says, ?Look at me!? So it is also the way in which information might be packaged for them at that age and stage. NARR	It is not only in Jamaica that the use of computers is growing. Andrea Robbin, Head of the Nutrition Unit within the Ministry of Health and the Environment told me about the situation in St Vincent and the Grenadines. Robbin	I think that the youth are embracing, for example, computer based technologies and older persons maybe a little more tentative and sometimes the policymakers are the older persons. But in St Vincent and the Grenadines we have a government Internet, a website and government Intranet as well as government email. So those are opportunities for sharing information that we really want to use and our nutrition unit in the Ministry of Health and Environment is already submitting information to the St Vincent and the Grenadines government website in terms of the newspaper articles and some of the radio scripts that we produce. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a need for access for the consumers in terms of Internet access to that website and to maybe other websites related to food and nutrition security. Hardware in terms of actual computers. I think the government has programmes to introduce computers to maybe community resource centres and learning centres, but I do not know in terms of how far it reaches. Thorp	So that people could go to that community resource centre and download information that they needed on recipes or good nutrition or breastfeeding for instance? Robbin	Absolutely or backyard gardening best practices, or other aspects of food and nutrition security whether it is from an agricultural perspective, health perspective, nutrition perspective. NARR	And while the use of computers to access information is starting to grow, they also have other uses. Thomas Burton, from Jamaica?s Rural Agricultural Development Authority, RADA, explains how his organisation is using them to record and analyse information, as well as provide it. Burton	Well at the moment RADA is trying to implement an ICT based information system, which will benefit both the extension officers and the farmers. We are at the moment carrying out a national registration programme for all farmers, so that we can know the numbers with whom we are interacting and can make plans to satisfy their various demands. This information that is garnered will also give the size of the holdings that they are operating, their locations, what they are planting at the various times and what is expected, times of harvesting and output possible. It will also give a possibility on projected price so the farmers will know how much they can expect to earn from a given unit area of production. The extension officer will input this data on his computer system and then farmers can also come to the office and get information from him on what has been required in the different market centres at different times. Thorp	And how do farmers feel, do you think farmers are willing to embrace new technologies in order to get the information that they require? Burton	They are willing to embrace the technology but the older farmers are at a disadvantage in that they have not been trained in how to use these devices. So what we are hoping is that the children who are currently in school and are being afforded the opportunity to learn how to use the computers for example can now pass on information to their parents. The problem also is that many of these resource deficient farmers are not able to buy computer equipment so they will have to probably depend on what is at the library or what is in the community centre and this can slow down the process. So we are hoping that as the price of the equipment gets lower, then more persons will be able to access this. However if they cannot access it in their own homes we have 60 extension offices across the island which are being equipped with computers so the farmers can go to these centres and get the information that they require.
