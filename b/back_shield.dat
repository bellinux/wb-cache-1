40|$|The {{work of this}} PhD {{thesis is}} focused on the {{processing}} and characterisation of ZrB 2 /SiC based multilayer materials, produced by tape casting and sintered without pressure assistance for aerospace applications. The multilayer components were processed in order to be used as external part of a thermal protection system; because of they directly face the atmosphere, in order to withstand high temperature, high heat fluxes and oxidizing environment, they have to show good oxidation and thermal shock resistance, high emissivity, thermal management capability, suitable strength, stiffness and hardness. The development of materials was directed along three main concepts: SiC based multilayer system was developed for the <b>back</b> <b>shield</b> part of the re-entry vehicle which was moderately loaded; ZrB 2 /SiC composite multilayers showing different ZrB 2 :SiC ratio were mainly designed for the front shield where the operating condition should be more severe (that means both higher temperature and thermal loads respect to those expected for the <b>back</b> <b>shield).</b> Moreover, in the context of development of reusable TPS to be used for consecutive missions, hybrid multilayer with ZrB 2 /SiC composite layers in between SiC ones have been prepared: the aim was provide for the degradation of SiC/SiO 2 external part inserting an underlying material showing good mechanical and thermal properties at the higher temperature (over 1700 °C). These three kinds of ceramic multilayer were processed and characterized from mechanical point of view; short and long term oxidation resistance have been detailed investigated. Tests under re-entry conditions have been performe...|$|E

40|$|A {{solar cell}} {{degradation}} model {{developed for the}} SECKSPOT trajectory optimization code is presented. The model is based on two analytic expressions, one describing solar cell power degradation {{as a function of}} 1 MeV equivalent fluence and cell base resistivity and thickness, and one describing a spatial field of 1 MeV equivalent electron flux. The model extends the latitude range, provides a continuous and smooth representation of the flux field, and provides for changing the cell characteristics. Construction of a 1 MeV electron flux model and of a power loss model are described. It is shown that modeling the 1 MeV flux field as a separate entity allows simple consideration of both front and <b>back</b> <b>shielding,</b> and that the coefficients relating to specific cell damage data can be simply updated using the latest cell damage data once the general analytical characteristics of the model have been established...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} lightning arrester energy due to <b>back</b> flashover and <b>shielding</b> failure phenomena in a 132 kV transmission line in Malaysia. The transmission line, towers and surge arresters were modeled using PSCAD/EMTDC software. The model {{has been used to}} simulate the discharged energy from lightning arresters that were installed on the tower in the event of <b>back</b> flashover and <b>shielding</b> failure. The arrester was modeled based on the IEEE frequency dependent model. Comparison between the simulation results and values calculated theoretically was performed to validate the model that has been developed. The results show that both are in reasonable agreement with each other. The maximum calculated and simulated energy discharged by the arrester is found to be less than 5. 1 kJ/kV, which is the rating of arresters installed in the actual 132 kV transmission lines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{electromagnetic}} shielding effectiveness (SE) of cement based composites filled with carbon black and carbon fiber were {{discussed in this}} paper.

Adding carbon black and carbon fiber, SE of the cement based materials get more upward gradient, the maximum SE reached 27 dB in tested frequency range...|$|R
50|$|In July 1995, units 318254 and 318262 were {{operating}} a Glasgow Central to Largs service when a braking system failure {{resulted in the}} train overshooting {{the end of the}} platform at Largs railway station.

5000|$|Effectiveness of {{cathodic}} protection (CP) systems on steel pipelines can be impaired {{by the use}} of solid film backed dielectric coatings such as polyethylene tapes, shrinkable pipeline sleeves, and factory applied single or multiple solid film coatings. This phenomenon occurs because of the high electrical resistivity of these film backings. [...] Protective electric current from the {{cathodic protection}} system is blocked or shielded from reaching the underlying metal by the highly resistive film <b>backing.</b> Cathodic <b>shielding</b> was first defined in the 1980s as being a problem, and technical papers on the subject have been regularly published since then.|$|R
50|$|Successful {{orbital welding}} is also {{dependent}} upon having a reasonably clean source of Argon for <b>backing</b> and <b>shielding</b> gas. Minimum purity would be 99.995% for typical industrial applications. For some applications {{it is necessary}} to use ultra high purity argon, 99.9998% purity and such applications requires the use of all high purity purge equipment (valves, regulators and flow control). Typically, no rubber components can be used for purge gas apparatus since the rubber absorbs and releases moisture and oxygen into the argon stream. Moisture and oxygen (in Argon) are contaminants detrimental to a successful automatic orbital weld.|$|R

40|$|A debris-flow {{catastrophe}} hit {{the city}} of Zhouqu, Gansu Province, western China, at midnight on 7 August 2010 following a local extreme rainfall of 77. 3 mm h− 1 in the Sanyanyu and Luojiayu ravines, which are located {{to the north of}} the urban area. Eight buildings damaged in the event were investigated in detail to study the characteristics and patterns of damage to buildings by debris flows. It was found that major structural damage was caused by the frontal impact of proximal debris flows, while non-structural damage was caused by lateral accumulation and abrasion of sediment. The impact had a boundary decreasing effect when debris flows encountered a series of obstacles, and the inter-positioning of buildings produced so-called <b>back</b> <b>shielding</b> effects on the damage. Impact, accumulation, and abrasion were the three main patterns of damage to buildings in this event. The damage scale depended not only on the flow properties, such as density, velocity, and depth, but also on the structural strength of buildings, material, orientation, and geometry. Reinforced concrete-framed structures can effectively resist a much higher debris-flow impact than brick-concrete structures. With respect to the two typical types of structure, a classification scheme to assess building damage is proposed by referring to the Chinese Classification System of Earthquake Damage to Buildings. Furthermore, three damage scales (major structural, minor structural, and non-structural damage) are defined by critical values of impact pressure. Finally, five countermeasures for effectively mitigating the damage are proposed according to the on-site investigation...|$|R
