500|$|In 1901, {{the newly}} created American League had {{attracted}} several of the top players in the competing National League to join its ranks. Rogers declined Lajoie's request {{for an increase in}} salary and as a result, Lajoie jumped to the crosstown Philadelphia Athletics, owned by former Phillies' part-owner Benjamin Shibe and managed by Connie Mack. Frank Hough offered Lajoie the contract on behalf of Mack. [...] "Hough offered me $24,000 ($ in current dollar terms) for four years. You can <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> signed in a hurry", Lajoie said. Lajoie was considered [...] "the first superstar" [...] to join the newly formed AL. He was also the first player whose yearly salary was for $4,000 ($ in current dollar terms). [...] "The Phillies opened their season and drew 6,000 fans. A week later, when we opened, there were 16,000 in the stands. The American League was here to stay", Lajoie later said. Lajoie's batting average that year was [...]426 (it was originally recorded at [...]405, later changed to [...]422 before finally revised again to [...]426). The batting average mark became the all-time AL record after the number was revised. Previously, Ty Cobb and George Sisler had been credited with having the AL's all-time mark. That same year in a game against the Chicago White Sox' Clark Griffith, Lajoie became the second Major Leaguer to be intentionally walked with the bases loaded in an 117 game after Abner Dalrymple in 1881. For the 1901 season, Lajoie led the majors in doubles (48), and led the majors in hits (232), batting average (.426), runs (145), on-base (.463) and slugging percentage (.643), and total bases (350). His 125 RBIs led the AL and his 14 home runs were a career-best and his 48 doubles are a Philadelphia Athletics' record. Mack said of Lajoie, [...] "He plays so naturally and so easily it looks like lack of effort." [...] Author Robert Kelly writes: ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2013, it was {{revealed}} that due to the success of Texas Chainsaw 3D, Millennium Films began planning a sequel film to be called Texas Chainsaw 4 which was expected to begin filming later in 2013 in the state of Louisiana. Millennium Films Chairman Avi Lerner stated that the project was brought to him by Christa Campbell and Lati Grobman and that Millennium had signed on to produce, with Lionsgate distributing the finished product. Executive producer Mark Burg clarified that the sequel was prematurely announced and had not been authorised, [...] "The rights are controlled by Carl [...] and Main Line Pictures, no matter what Millennium says. Millennium simply sold the foreign rights and they will not tell us when a sequel is ready to be made. The script was developed by Carl, myself and writer/director John Luessenhop. Maybe they're looking for something to sell at Berlin, but they have no right to announce this sequel." [...] The idea for a prequel came when Seth M. Sherwood was given the chance to pitch the film to the studio. Dissatisfied with the inconsistencies of the franchise's continuity, he opted to make a Chainsaw film that wasn't just another sequel to the original: [...] "My pitch was always about doing it completely out of left field and making it different. The first thing I said to Millennium was 'I <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> can tell you what everybody else is pitching you and it’s X-Y-Z, but I want to do 1-2-3', and luckily, that's the direction they were interested in going as well." [...] The script was approached as a story of identity, based on the statements given by Tobe Hooper and Gunnar Hansen on how the character Leatherface is entirely devoid of personality beyond the masks he wears and what his family commands him to do. Sherwood chose not to have Leatherface be born as intellectually disabled, finding the story of a functional person that has their mental capabilities reduced to be more fascinating. Producer Les Whedon detailed the reasoning behind accepting Sherwood's pitch: [...] "What interested and enticed us about this production was {{the fact that we were}} presented with an opportunity to re-invent the franchise. It was the opportunity to almost go behind-the-scenes into the beginning of how Leatherface was created. What happened? Who is Leatherface and how did the whole character come to be?" [...] Despite the film's explanatory premise, co-director Julien Maury found it important to maintain some of the lead character's mystique, referring the project simply as [...] "moments from his young years." ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Type I allergy {{represents}} a severe health problem in industrialized countries where up to 20 % {{of the population}} suffer from allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis and allergic asthma bronchiale and in severe cases from anaphylaxis, leading to death. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate recombinant <b>Bet</b> v <b>I,</b> the major birch pollen allergen for in vivo and in vitro diagnosis of birch pollen allergy. METHODS: A group of 51 birch pollen allergic patients and eight non-allergic control individuals were tested for birch pollen allergy by skin-prick and intradermal testing, comparing commercial birch pollen extracts with recombinant <b>Bet</b> v <b>I.</b> Quantitative and qualitative serological testing was done with natural and recombinant allergens by radioallergosorbent test (RAST), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting. RESULTS: Recombinant <b>Bet</b> v <b>I</b> allowed accurate in vivo and in vitro diagnosis of tree pollen allergy in 49 / 51 patients tested. No false positive results were obtained in any in vitro assay system (ELISA, Western blot) or by skin testing (skin-prick, intradermal test) with recombinant <b>Bet</b> v <b>I.</b> CONCLUSION: Our results document that recombinant <b>Bet</b> v <b>I</b> produced in bacterial expression systems allows accurate in vitro and in vivo diagnosis of birch pollen allergy in > 95 % of birch pollen allergic patients...|$|R

40|$|A {{generalized}} weak dominance {{approach is}} {{used to test the}} documented preference reversal (PR) phenomenon. This approach simply models risky choice behavior in PR as a choice between the best possible outcomes or a choice between the worst possible outcomes by equating smaller paired outcome difference between bets. The preference reversals are therefore seen {{as a consequence of the}} fact that gamble parameters are designed to encourage individuals to differentiate the difference between the worst possible outcomes of the two <b>bets</b> (<b>i.</b> e., to avoid the worse possible outcome of $ bet) rather than to differentiate the difference between the best possible outcomes of the two <b>bets</b> (<b>i.</b> e., to seek the better outcome of $ bet on which people tend to put a higher price). A "matching" task as well as a "pricing" task was designed to examine whether the knowledge of the value difference of the paired possible outcomes will permit prediction of preferential choice. The overall test results favor the equate-to-differentiate explanation. The present data suggest that the anomaly may be not in individuals' inconsistent preferences but rather in our inadequate knowledge of what it is that is being preferred when a question about preference is posed.
