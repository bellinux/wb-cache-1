25|$|Arsenic is a neurotoxin {{commonly}} found concentrated in areas exposed to agricultural runoff, mining, and smelting sites (Martinez-Finley 2011). One {{of the effects}} of arsenic ingestion during the development of the nervous system is the inhibition of neurite growth which can occur both in PNS and the CNS. This neurite growth inhibition can often lead to defects in neural migration, and significant morphological changes of neurons during development,) often leading to neural tube defects in neonates. As a metabolite of arsenic, arsenite is formed after ingestion of arsenic and has shown significant toxicity to neurons within about 24 hours of exposure. The mechanism of this cytotoxicity functions through arsenite-induced increases in intracellular calcium ion levels within neurons, which may subsequently reduce mitochondrial transmembrane potential which activates caspases, triggering cell death. Another known function of arsenite is its destructive nature towards the cytoskeleton through inhibition of neurofilament transport. This is particularly destructive as neurofilaments are used in <b>basic</b> <b>cell</b> structure and support. Lithium administration has shown promise, however, in restoring some of the lost neurofilament motility. Additionally, similar to other neurotoxin treatments, the administration of certain antioxidants has shown some promise in reducing neurotoxicity of ingested arsenic.|$|E

The concept of switching cells in power electronic circuits started in the late 1970 ’s. The <b>basic</b> <b>cells</b> {{presented in this paper}} have one switching element (transistor) and one diode. The P-cell is the mirror circuit of the N-cell and vice-versa, and this paper suggests that (1) most power electronic circuits can be analyzed and re-constructed using these <b>basic</b> switching <b>cells,</b> (2) single, dual, and 6 -pack switching modules should be configured and laid-out according to the <b>basic</b> switching <b>cells</b> and not necessarily the conventional way used by industry, and (3) many benefits such as minimal parasitic inductance and dead-time elimination or minimization may come about.

With its intrinsic digital logic driven by quantised flux {{it has also}} {{the advantage of a}} very low power consumption. In connection with Josephson-Junctions of High-Temperature-Superconductors (HTS) with a high energy gap operation speed is expected to get even higher and temperatures above conventional Low-Temperature-Superconductors (LTS) are useable. So far HTS-RSFQ-circuits has been developed to demonstrate their function and investigate their order of working. Development of new technology to give designers the facility to compose such circuits out of <b>basic</b> <b>cells</b> has been an important and difficult task during the last years, because of the complexity of getting a suitable technology which guarantees a high quality for all epitaxially grown thin film-layers. An efficient process has to fulfill high demands on technology and design issues. To allow HTSL-RSFQ-circuits to work at higher temperatures the thermal noise has to be considerated. Especially for temperatures above twenty Kelvin thermal noise has high influence on the switching behaviour of the gates. Therefore <b>basic</b> <b>cells</b> with high immunity towards noise had been developed in cooperation with TU-Ilmenau. One major challenge on technology included the ability to get low inductances for superconductive loops. Their inductance value has to be about five picohenry at temperatures around fifty Kelvin. Demands on technology had been accomplished by a multilayer technology which includes a groundplane to allow the use of microstiplines to get low inductance values which are necessary for the immunity of <b>basic</b> <b>cells</b> towards noise. To get high flexibility for design a new fabrication process to make the use of small vias had been included in the fabrication process. After optimisation of all components the multilayer technology with designrules was practicable and investigations of fabricated <b>basic</b> <b>cells</b> could prove the utilisability of the developed technology. In addition there are indications for the operation of RSFQ in the gigahertz range even above the temperature of fifty Kelvin which is demonstated by the measurement of a circuit with a Toggle-Flip-Flop (TFF) ...|$|R

40|$|State-of-the art {{electronic}} systems include ever more features and gather mixed-signal subsystems, possibly from different physical domains. At the same time, cost and development time are reduced; stressing {{the need for}} an efficient design flow for fast and reliable design. The present thesis contributes to the construction of an improved design flow supported by mixed-signal hardware description languages (HDL-AMS). In a hierarchical view, the {{electronic systems}} are recursively divided into subsystems, down to <b>basic</b> <b>cells</b> and transistor level. The typical design flow results of a top-down synthesis, from the system specifications to the physical realizations, and of a bottom-up validation, from the test of the <b>basic</b> <b>cells</b> up to the test of the system. To improve the link between the technological level and the <b>basic</b> <b>cells,</b> we develop a measurement-based analog ID card which aims to optimize the analog performance and the reliability at high temperature by enabling the choice of optimal process (bulk vs. partially-depleted silicon-on-insulator (SOI) vs. fully-depleted SOI), optimal devices (e. g. multi-threshold voltages process) and optimal bias (weak vs. moderate vs. strong inversion). In the present thesis, we deal with the following analog performance parameters: gain, gain-bandwidth product, MOSFET mismatch in weak inversion and harmonic distortion of MOSFETs in triode regime. We show that SOI transistors are still advantageous over bulk in deep-submicron CMOS technologies and that short-channel SOI transistors can safely be used for mixed-signal operation up to 250 °C. The analog ID card can be included in the design flow supported by HDL-AMS. Behavioral models for the <b>basic</b> <b>cells</b> are developed using such languages and further assembled into a ÄÓ modulator with continuous-time integrators as it is a good candidate for low-power consumption and operation at high temperature. The related design issues are assessed using the behavioral models and a design optimization method is presented for a key building block, an active RC integrator with passive resistors.
