40|$|A major hexosamine, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), exists <b>in</b> <b>polymeric</b> <b>form</b> <b>in</b> chitin, a {{component}} of fungal cell walls and the exoskeletons of crustaceans, in heteropolysaccharides of mammalian proteoglycan, and in the peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell walls (Kent et al. 1953). Derived from GlcNAc, the nucleotide sugar uridine 5 -diphospho-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is prerequisite for biosyntheses of GlcNAc-containing polymers and glycoproteins, which have important cellular functions. Although higher plants are devoid of GlcNAc <b>in</b> <b>polymeric</b> <b>form,</b> GlcNAc is activated into UDP-GlcNAc; then it is transferred into carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins in plant cells, as it is as in mammalian cells. L-Glutamine D-fructose- 6 -phosphate amidotrans-ferase (GFAT) catalyzes the following reaction irreversibly: D-fructose- 6 PL-GlutamineD-gluco-samine- 6 PL-glutamate. This {{is the first step}} in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, and a key step leading to formation of UDP-GlcNAc. The mammalian, yeast, and bacterial enzymes and genes encoding the enzymes have been well characterized (Milewski 2002). The presence of GFAT in higher plants was demonstrated (Hassid et al. 1959) and partially purified enzyme fractions were characterized (Vessal and Hassid 1972). Although the genes which were putatively assigned as GFAT genes are found in the Arabidopsis genome sequence (Kaneko et al. 2000), the catalytic activity of the proteins encoded by the genes remains unclear. We describe the identification of an Arabidopsis GFAT gene by measuring the enzymatic activity of the protein encoded by the gene, and metabolic engineering of hexosamines using a viral GFAT gene in plant cells. To express the protein encoded by the Arabidopsis gene (accession no. AT 3 g 24090), a cDNA clone was isolated from 1 -week-old-seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana.

The inhibitory factor directly interacted with DC-SIGN and prevented the HIV- 1 gp 120 envelope protein from binding to the receptor.

Here, concentrations of solvent-extractable anhydrosugars and methoxyphenols are compared to the yields of polymeric lignin oxidation products (LOPs) during a smoke plume event in Houston, Texas. Downwind aerosol samples (PM 2. 5) were collected surrounding a two-day wildfire in the McFaddin National Wildlife Refuge, 125 km southeast of Houston, which was 12 – 16 h directly downwind during {{the peak of the}} burn. Concentrations of all organic markers, potassium, and calcium increased by a factor of 2 – 13 within 1 – 2 days of the start of the fire and dropped to prefire levels 3 days after the peak event. Source signatures of anhydrosugars and methoxyphenols during the peak of the plume were identical to those of grass charcoals collected from the site, confirming the use of charcoals as end-members for source input reconstruction during atmospheric transport. An enrichment factor of 20 in the anhydrosugar to methoxyphenol ratio of aerosols versus charcoals can be explained partially by differences in degradation rate constants between the biomarker groups.

Decades-old experiments in the model Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus subtilis 168, using phage-resistant mutants implicated tagE (also called gtaA and rodD) as the gene coding for the wall teichoic acid glycosyltransferase. This study and others have provided only indirect evidence to support a role for TagE in wall teichoic acid glycosylation. In this work, we showed that deletion of tagE resulted in the loss of α-glucose at the C- 2 position of glycerol in the poly(glycerol phosphate) polymer backbone.

(2) Rabbit platelets adhered to a monomeric collagen extracted without pepsin by a process that was cation-independent; human platelet adhesion to this collagen exhibited a cation-independent element. (3) Human platelet adhesion to polymeric collagens, including intact native fibres and those reconstituted from pepsin-extracted monomeric collagens, exhibited appreciable cation-independence; adhesion of rabbit platelets to these collagens occurred only by a cation-independent process; pepsin treatment of the intact fibres caused a reduction in cation-independent binding. Two mechanisms of adhesion can therefore be distinguished, one Mg 2 (+) -dependent, expressed by human, but not rabbit, platelets, the other cation-independent and exhibited by platelets of both species. Mg 2 (+) -dependent and cation-independent adhesion sites are located within the triple helix of collagen, but the latter sites are only expressed <b>in</b> collagen <b>in</b> <b>polymeric</b> <b>form.</b> <b>In</b> neither case is the helical conformation of the sites essential for their binding activity.

We show here that succination of protein is also increased in epididymal, mesenteric, and subcutaneous adipose tissue of diabetic (db/db) mice and that adiponectin is a major target for succination in both adipocytes and adipose tissue. Cys- 39, which is involved in cross-linking of adiponectin monomers to form trimers, {{was identified as a}} key site of succination of adiponectin in adipocytes. 2 SC was detected on two of seven monomeric forms of adiponectin immunoprecipitated from adipocytes and epididymal adipose tissue.

We {{have studied the}} interaction of monoclonal IgA antibodies directed against specific enteric viruses, or the hapten trinitrophenyl (TNP), with M cells. To produce monospecific IgA antibodies against mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and reovirus type 1, Peyer's patch cells from mucosally immunized mice were fused with myeloma cells, generating hybridomas that secreted virus-specific IgA antibodies <b>in</b> monomeric and <b>polymeric</b> <b>forms.</b> One of two anti-MMT...|$|R
40|$|Tritiated aqueous waste {{can be used}} to hydrate {{hydraulic}} cement producing a concrete that contains a network of interconnected porosity. Such a product is subject to water intrusion and subsequent tritium loss by leaching and exchange. Techniques have been developed to impregnate this porosity with styrene monomer which is then polymerized in situ, resulting in a concrete that is essentially impermeable while its strength, durability, and resistance to chemical attack are significantly improved. Tritium bulk leach rates as low as 1. 68 x 10 $sup - 4 $ g/(cm$sup 2 $-day) have been measured for polymer-impregnated concrete in water. An adsorbent additive can be incorporated to increase the specific tritiated waste loading of the concrete. Depending upon the formulations, these composites incorporate 5. 8 to 8. 3 liters HTO per cubic foot. Tritiated aqueous waste can also be fixed <b>in</b> <b>polymeric</b> <b>form</b> as polyacetylene through reaction with calcium carbide to form tritiated acetylene which is subsequently polymerized. Acetylene polymerization is accomplished by either $sup 60 $Co gamma irradiation or thermal catalysis over cupric oxide. The tritiated polyacetylene produced can contain up to 50 atomic percent tritium and is essentially non-leachable, insoluble, thermally stable to 325 $sup 0 $C, and chemically inert. The bulk leach rate of tritiated polyacetylene was determined to be of the order of 1. 8 x 10 $sup - 8 $ g/(cm$sup 2 $-day). Radiolysis by $sup 60 $Co gamma irradiation results in a G value for hydrogen production of 0. 15 molecules/ 100 eV. Tritiated polyacetylene can be incorporated as an aggregate in concrete, polymer concrete, or polymer impregnated concrete to form a monolithic solid. (auth...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} in fission yeast two DNA {{fragments}} at the silent P mating type locus provide plasmids with the capability of autonomous replication. Bacterial vectors containing these sequences replicate <b>in</b> a <b>polymeric</b> <b>form</b> <b>in</b> fission yeast very much like plasmids with the commonly used replication sequence ars 1, do. There are, however, several {{differences between the two}} new ars sequences. The percentage of cells containing the plasmid during selection, the plasmid copy number and the plasmid segregation during mitosis are all dependent on the choice of the ars sequence. A DNA fragment with ars activity from {{the left side of the}} silent P cassette represses the expression of the marker gene, ura 4 +, at least three hundred fold compared to plasmids containing only the other new ars sequence or only ars 1. The importance of replication in this promoter independent transcriptional regulation is further substantiated by the fact that the repression is partially released in the presence of ars 1 on the same plasmid...|$|R

This element is highly depleted on interstellar grains in dense sources but in an unobserved form. We have started to develop new clues regarding {{the form of the}} depleted sulphur using detailed modelling of the sulphur chemistry and comparisons with observations (Wakelam et al. 2004). This previous study underlined the possibility for sulphur to be depleted on grains <b>in</b> a <b>polymeric</b> <b>form</b> from S to S 8 in complexity. Some of the lines of these species can be observed with ALMA and will require the high ALMA sensitivity and spatial resolution to be detected. In this contribution we discuss how possible ALMA observations could help to give constraints on the abundance of S-polymers. Finding these species would be an important step inthe understanding of the chemistry in both molecular clouds and protostars...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantity}} and subclass distribution of IgA {{produced by the}} human uterine cervix may {{have a significant impact}} on the defence against sexually transmitted diseases as well as the regulation of fertility. Cervical mucus was obtained from 15 normal ovulating women around the time of ovulation. The total amounts of secreted IgA (including IgA 1 and IgA 2), IgG, and IgM were determined by ELISA. IgA was detected at high levels in all samples of cervical mucus. When ovulation was ascertained by daily urinary luteinizing hormone testing, IgA production was maximal 2 – 3 days before ovulation. Equal proportions of IgA 1 and IgA 2 were detected in cervical mucus, and 80 % of the IgA occurred <b>in</b> the <b>polymeric</b> <b>forms.</b> The increased levels of IgA, the ratios of IgA 1 to IgA 2, and the predominance of polymeric IgA indicate that much of the IgA in human uterine cervical fluid originates from local production...|$|R
