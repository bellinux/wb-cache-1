50|$|Gulf darters are {{classified}} as insectivores, feeding on small invertebrates, including black flies, mayflies, and dragonflies. One studied found larval dipterans {{are the most important}} food items in fish of all sizes, in which chironomids were found in 71-100% of the stomachs examined. The primary predators of the gulf darter probably are larger freshwater fish, such as <b>burbots</b> (Lota lota), stonecats (Noturus flavus), and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu). The gulf darter, like many other darter species, have the ability to maintain position on the substrate in flowing water.

50|$|Fishermen {{say that}} the {{underwater}} world of Lake Brosno has a structure of several levels. From time to time, <b>burbots</b> and yellow perch {{can be found in}} the lake. For example, herring can be found in a lake in Peno District in the Tver Region. Some consider it strange that sea fish may live in the lake at all. Smelt shoals can be found in Lake Brosno as well. The phenomenon of Brosnya can be explained from the physical point of view: huge smelt shoals are reflected on the water surface through refraction of light and produces the effect of a huge reptile head. Physicists say that any mirage appears in hot weather. Indeed, witnesses {{say that the}}y came across Brosnya in summer. However, the origin of the rumors of this strange monster remain a mystery.|$|R
50|$|Johnny darters prefer {{clear water}} with sandy and gravelly bottoms. They like slow-moving water, {{but can be}} found in {{moderately}} cloudy, moving water, as well. They are bottom dwellers and stay on rocks at the bottoms of small ponds and streams with their heads facing into the current. Of all the darter species, the johnny darter is the most tolerant of diverse conditions. Since this darter is a benthic, its mouth is a subterminal where the nose is only slightly beyond the mouth and is situated in an inferior position that makes it easy for it to eat and catch food. Its diet is varied, but as young fish, it tends to eat copepods, small crustaceans, and waterfleas. As it grows, the fish start eating larger waterfleas, different types of larvae, including midges, mayflies, and caddisflies, and the occasional sideswimmer.These darters are generally eaten by larger predatory fish, such as <b>burbots,</b> lake trout, smallmouth bass, walleyes, and yellow perch.|$|R
25|$|The Smith River is an {{excellent}} sport fishery. Sport fish include brown trout, rainbow trout, and whitefish. Other species widely fished in the area include brook trout, <b>burbot</b> (also known as ling), and cutthroat trout. Non-game fish which may also be caught include longnose dace, longnose sucker, mottled sculpin, mountain sucker, stonecat, and white sucker. Nonnative carp were present as late as 1995, but have been removed as of 2009.|$|E
25|$|The Yup'ik {{region is}} rich with waterfowl, fish, and sea and land mammals.

Even the endangered otter and kingfisher live here.Salmon fishing in the Örtze had been recorded since 1766, but the last salmon was caught in 1935. Since 1982 {{attempts have been made}} to re-introduce salmon by stocking the river. The weir at Wolthausen is, however, an obstacle to fish swimming upstream. From the 16th century until 1960 the Örtze drove the water wheel of a corn mill here. Today by contrast it powers a turbine next to the water wheel to generate electricity. A fish pass (a fish ladder with eight steps and suitable for invertebrates) is being planned.|$|R
50|$|Piusa Ancient Valley Holiday Complex is {{situated}} in the former place of Väiko-Härma mill. Väiko-Härma mill was established by Aleksander Laanberg (later changed to Laanemäe through Estonianization) around the 1930s, he attained the building site on the right bank of the river. He made a contract with Voldemar Vider, {{the owner of the}} left bank to use the bank, by paying 20 poods of rye a year. The mill had two sets of stones. One set of stones was able to grind 300-400 kilos of dry grains in an hour. Besides milling, the following services were provided: spalting - that kept the roofs in the neighbourhood in order, a circular saw made it able to manufacture shingles and fence rails, a planer was used for making smaller woodwork. The mill lake had pikes, perches, <b>burbots,</b> roaches, brown trouts and crayfish in it. In 1963, the mill belonged to “Võidu” sovkhoz, the miller was Kusta Klaas, who, as a knowledgeable expert, fixed up the mill. The mill ran until 1972. In 1946, a new house was built near the mill (the current holiday house), where Laanemäe family lived until 1961. After that the building was empty.|$|R
50|$|This darter's {{habitat is}} highly {{specialized}} and dependent on {{water quality and}} stream velocity. These habitats are located in eddies and riffles behind boulders in large to moderately sized, gravel-bottomed streams. More specifically, populations often exist in the benthopelagic regions in the water column, ranging from depths of 10 to 30 cm. Its diet typically consists of insect (e.g. dipteran) larvae due mostly to morphological restraints, including an average gape size of around 8 mm. Temperature ranges year-round are unknown, but spawning water temperatures range from 10 to 24°C. Predators for this particular species are not clear, but data on a sister species, the rainbow darter (E. caeruleum), suggest larger freshwater fish, such as <b>burbots</b> (Lota lota), stonecats (Noturus flavus), and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) {{have been known to}} prey on darters. Although data are largely unknown, predation effects on the bluebreast darter are thought to be relatively low due to the small, localized habitats of this species in riffles and eddies behind boulders that prevent larger pelagic fish from exploiting them. Typical anthropogenic effects detrimental to their ecology include strip mining, mica shale siltation, impoundments (dams), and agricultural drainage runoff.|$|R
25|$|An {{unintended}} {{benefit of}} the round goby's introduction is that the Lake Erie watersnake, once listed as a threatened species, has found the goby to be a tasty addition to its diet. A recent study found the introduced fish now accounts for up to 90% of the snake's diet. The new food supply means that the water snake is now staging a comeback. Round gobies also serve as food {{for a variety of}} predatory fishes in the Great Lakes, including bass, lake trout, lake whitefish, <b>burbot,</b> and walleye.|$|E

In addition, many fish species have been either intentionally or accidentally introduced to Lake Superior: Atlantic salmon, brown trout, carp, chinook salmon, coho salmon, freshwater drum, pink salmon, rainbow smelt, rainbow trout, round goby, ruffe, sea lamprey and white perch.|$|E
25|$|The most commons {{species of}} fish in the river are Coregonus lavaretus, European perch and {{northern}} pike, all three which have been the basis for sustenance fishing. Less commons species include <b>burbot,</b> grayling and brown trout. Five thousand trouts are set out each year to sustain the population. Especially the lake Kaskamajärvi has a large trout population. The lower portion of the river previously had some Atlantic salmon, but these have all but disappeared since the hydroelectric stations were installed. Uncommon fish species include European river lamprey, three-spined stickleback, nine-spined stickleback and common minnow. Vendace is an introduced species in Lake Inari and has spread to the reserve.|$|E
5000|$|The rainbow darter is {{classified}} as insectivorous, feeding on small invertebrates such as insects and crayfish, {{but it has also}} been known to feed on some fish larvae. In Four-Mile Creek in Ohio, the rainbow darter lives primarily on trichopterans (i.e. caddisflies), having two feeding peaks: one in the morning and a second in the late afternoon or early evening.The primary predators of the rainbow darter are larger freshwater fish, such as <b>burbots</b> (Lota lota), stonecats (Noturus flavus), and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu). Like many other darter species, it has the ability to maintain position on the substrate in flowing water. This unique characteristic {{plays a key role in}} its microhabitat preference. E. caeruleum has been shown to prefer creeks and rivers with rocky substrates and swift-moving riffles. This microhabitat preference has been suggested to be due to oxygen levels in the water during season changes or other factors, such as feeding or shelter-related habitat preferences. [...] Because E. caeruleum has such a low tolerance for brackish water, human-induced changes such as pollution or sewer drainage has the potential to cause a significant negative impact on its abundance.|$|R
50|$|Parker {{returned}} to England for a year, living in Chichester in Sussex {{where he worked}} at the Chichester Rubber Glove Factory.By 1971, he had left England again and spent time in Paris right {{at the time of the}} Free Angela Davis march through the city. From France, Parker hitchhiked through Spain to Morocco, where he traveled around for a year before moving to Gibraltar. In Gibraltar he worked on the docks unloading frozen foods, which he then helped deliver to supermarkets.His guitar playing and writing skills were improving, and after playing songs to a few locals in a bar, he found himself on an afternoon show on Gibraltar television where he performed two or three of his own songs. At that time, a strongly psychedelic influenced band named Pegasus often played in the same bar and asked Parker to join them. With Parker in the band playing a borrowed electric guitar, Pegasus played one show in Gibraltar before going to Tangier, Morocco, where they briefly performed in a nightclub. Parker, however, was growing out of the hippie trappings and decided the band needed to learn a few songs that involved major keys (all the songs they played were in A minor) and so taught the members some of the soul numbers he had loved as a youth, including Wilson Pickett’s In The Midnight Hour. He also tired of the band's hippie name and renamed them Terry <b>Burbot’s</b> Magic Mud.|$|R
40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} (POPs) {{have been widely}} distributed throughout the world for decades and while the use of some have been phased out, others are still being utilised and their levels are rising in biota. Levels detected in tissue and blood samples have caused for {{a growing concern for}} their potential effects on humans and wildlife and many effects studies have been performed. Focus for research has, however, mainly been on high concentrations of single compounds, although it is the realistic levels of real life mixtures of compounds found in the environment that may possess such a threat. In this study, we have investigated the long term effects of environmentally relevant levels of real life mixtures of POPs using the zebrafish as a biomonitor organism. <b>Burbots</b> (Lota lota) from two sites within the same freshwater system in Norway, Lake Mjøsa and Lake Losna, with different history of pollution, were captured and POPs extracted from the liver oil. Zebrafish were exposed indirectly, by exposing their live-food, from start of feeding and until sexual maturation to either the Losna mixture or to one of three dose levels of the Mjøsa mixture. Survival was monitored throughout the experiment while other demographic variables such as growth and sex ratio were evaluated at the time of sexual maturity. Traditional (protein) biomarkers for EROD activity and vitellogenin induction were also measured in addition to organ-specific differences in gene expression pattern using microarray analysis. Exposure resulted in significant lower survival rate and increased growth of the fish, while a small but significant induction was observed in the EROD activity. Analysis of gene expression patterns revealed small changes in mRNA levels though differences were clearly seen. The microarray assay indicated oestrogenic effects of both of the mixtures, in addition to other endocrine disrupting effects related to the steroid- and thyroid hormones. We conclude that long term exposure to real life mixtures of POPs caused direct morphological and phenotypic changes and effects systems related to development and reproduction even at low levels found in the environment, and thus may pose a potential health risk for humans and wildlife living in exposed areas or in other ways being frequently exposed to such mixtures of toxins...|$|R

25|$|The Nivkh had {{a diverse}} diet being semi-sedentary before colonization. Fish {{was the main}} source of food for the Nivkh, {{including}} pink, Pacific, and chum salmon as well as trout, Red Eye, <b>burbot</b> and pike found in rivers and streams. Salt water fishing provided saffron cod, flatfish, and marine goby caught in the littoral coasts of the Strait of Tartary, Sea of Okhotsk, and the Pacific Ocean, though over fishing by Russian and Japanese trawlers have depleted many of these fish stocks. Additionally, industrial pollution such as phenols and heavy metals in the Amur River have devastated fish stocks and damaged the soil of the estuaries. A traditional preservation process called Yukola, involving slicing the fish in a particular way and drying the strips by hanging them in the frigid air, without salt, was used before foreign influences. The preservation process created a lot of dried fish waste, unpalatable for human consumption but utilized for dog food. Pulverizing dried fish and mixing it with fish skins, water, seal fat, and berries until the mixture had a sour cream consistency is a favorite Nivkh dish called mos. Nivkhs would hunt seal (Larha, Reinged, Reibbon, Sea-lions), duck, sable, and otters. They would gather various berries, wild leeks, lilybulbs, and nuts. Contacts with the Chinese, Manchu, and Japanese from the 12th century on introduced new foods incorporated in the Nivkhs diet such as salt, sugar, rice, millet, legumes and tea. Russian 19th century colonisation introduced flour, bread, potatoes, vodka, tobacco, butter, canned vegetables and fruits, and other meats.|$|E
