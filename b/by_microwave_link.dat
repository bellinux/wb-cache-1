Symbol stream combining (SSC) has some advantages and some disadvantages over baseband combining (BBC). The SSC suffers almost no loss in combining the digital data and no loss due to the transmission of the digital data <b>by</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>links</b> between the stations.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1985 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaIt is {{difficult}} to transmit directly the data circulating on a 1553 -B bus <b>by</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> during a missile test, given {{that it is not}} a synchronous message. For the ANS missile the AEROSPATIALE tactical missile division has decided to include the 1553 message in a PCM message to IRIG standards. In view of the asynchronism between the traditional telemetering data and the bus message it has been necessary to develop a specific controller providing the interface between the bus and the IRIG PCM. This controller performs the functions of synchronization, encoding, structural analysis of message, adaptatin of the input speed to the PCM rate and also dating of the data. Moreover, during tests on the missile, it is necessary to process the bus data on the ground. A conventional decommutator, although suitable for the usual analog channels, cannot be used in real time. It is therefore been necessary to develop equipment providing on the ground the reconstitution of a 1553 bus that can be processed by ordinary standard equipment. After synchronizing and sorting the data in the IRIG format the equipment creates three types of messages corresponding: to the missile message, to the dating and to the message found erroneous during acquisition on board...|$|E

As these antennas become redundant, the possibility exists to convert them for radio astronomy at a cost of roughly one tenth that of a new antenna of similar size.

40|$|The {{average annual}} rain {{attenuation}} statistics experienced <b>by</b> individual <b>microwave</b> <b>links</b> are well understood. ITU-R models {{exist for the}} prediction of these statistics and {{they are used to}} assign power levels to links to achieve the desired availability. The performance of networks such as mulit-hop links or links utilising route, frequency or time diversity, is considerably more complex and only superficial guidance is available for their design. The complexity arises from the correlation of rain attenuation experienced by the various individual links in the network. To understand and predict the performance of these networks it is necessary to understand the spatial and temporal correlation of rain intensity. This paper introduces a model for the high-resolution spatial and temporal variation of rain intensity proposed by Paulson [2001]. This model allows the direct calculation of all the first and second order, temporal, statistics of rain attenuation experienced <b>by</b> pairs of <b>microwave</b> <b>links,</b> when the link system is covered by single rain events. The model is used to develop expressions for the joint rain attenuation distribution for pairs of links and hence expressions for diversity improvement.

40|$|Accurate {{rainfall}} observations {{with high}} {{spatial and temporal}} resolutions are needed for many applications, for instance, as input for hydrological models. Weather radars often provide data with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution, but usually need adjustment. In general, only few rain gauge measurements are available to adjust the radar data in real-time, for example, each hour. Physically based methods, such as a Vertical Profile of Reflectivity (VPR) correction, can be valuable and hold a promise. However, they are not always performed in real-time yet and {{can be difficult to}} implement. The estimation of rainfall using <b>microwave</b> <b>links</b> from commercial cellular telephone networks is a new and potentially valuable source of information. Such networks cover large parts of the land surface of the earth and have a high density. The data produced <b>by</b> the <b>microwave</b> <b>links</b> in such networks is essentially a by-product of the communication between mobile telephones. Rainfall attenuates the electromagnetic signals transmitted from one telephone tower to another. By measuring the received power at one end of a <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> as a function of time, the path-integrated attenuation due to rainfall can be calculated. Previous studies have shown that average rainfall intensities over the length of a link can be derived from the pathintegrated attenuation. A recent study of us shows that urban rainfall can be estimated from commercial <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> data for the Rotterdam region, a densely-populated delta city in the Netherlands. A data set from a commercial <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> network over the Netherlands is analyzed, containing approximately 1500 links covering the land surface of the Netherlands (35500 km 2). This data set consists of several days with extreme rainfall in June, July and August 2011. A methodology is presented to derive rainfall intensities and daily rainfall depths from the <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> data, which have a temporal resolution of 15 min. The magnitude and dynamics of these rainfall intensities is compared with those obtained from weather radar. Rainfall maps are derived from the <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> data and are verified against rainfall maps based on gaugeadjusted weather radar data. Although much more work needs to be done, the first results look promising. Since cellular telephone networks are used worldwide, data from such networks could also become a valuable source of rainfall information in countries which do not have continuously operating weather radars, and no or few rain gauges. Apart from rainfall maps which are solely based on <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> data, a preliminary analysis will be presented to assess whether commercial <b>microwave</b> <b>link</b> data can be used to adjust radar rainfall accumulations...|$|R

40|$|Future {{planetary}} campaigns, including human missions, {{will require}} data rates difficult to realize <b>by</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>links.</b> Optical channels not only provide {{an abundance of}} bandwidth, they also allow for significant size, weight, and power reduction. Moreover, optical-based tracking may enhance spacecraft navigation with respect to microwave-based tracking. With all its advantages, optical communications from deep space {{is not without its}} challenges. Due to the extreme distance between the two ends of the link, specialized technologies are needed to enable communications in the deep space environment. Although some of the relevant technologies have been developed in the last decade, they remain to be validated in an appropriate domain. The required assets include efficient pulsed laser sources, modulators, transmitters, receivers, detectors, channel encoders, precise beam pointing technologies for the flight transceiver and large apertures for the ground receiver. Clearly, space qualification is required for the systems that are installed on a deep space probe. Another challenge is atmospheric effects on the optical beam. Typical candidate locations on the ground have a cloud-free line of sight only on the order of 60 - 70 % of the time. Furthermore, atmospheric losses and background light can be problematic even during cloud-free periods. Lastly, operational methodologies are needed for efficient and cost effective management of optical links. For more than a decade, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has invested in relevant technologies and procedures to enable deep space optical communications capable of providing robust links with rates in the order of 1 Gb/s from Mars distance. A recent publication indicates that potential exists for 30 -dB improvement in performance through technology development with respect to the state-of-the-art {{in the early years of}} this decade.

40|$|Abstract—Numerous {{applications}} demand communication {{schemes that}} minimize the transmission delay while achieving a given level of reliability. An extreme case is high-frequency trading whereby saving {{a fraction of}} millisecond over a route between Chicago and New York can be a game-changer. While such communications are often carried <b>by</b> fiber, <b>microwave</b> <b>links</b> can reduce transmission delays over large distances due to more direct routes and faster wave propagation. In order to bridge large distances, information is sent over a multihop relay network. Motivated by these applications, this papers present an information-theoretic approach {{to the design of}} optimal multihop microwave networks that minimizes end-to-end transmission delay. To characterize the delay introduced by coding, we derive error exponents achievable in multihop networks. We formulate and solve an optimization problem that determines optimal selection of amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relays. We present the optimal solution for several examples of networks. We prove that in high SNR the optimum transmission scheme is for all relays to perform amplify-and-forward.
