5|$|Upon {{commissioning}} in 1932–33, the D class {{formed the}} 1st Destroyer Flotilla {{assigned to the}} Mediterranean Fleet. The flotilla toured the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea in September–November 1933. After refitting in the UK during 1934, the flotilla {{was transferred to the}} China Station, arriving at Hong Kong in January 1935 and renumbered as the 8th Destroyer Flotilla. Most of the flotilla was sent to the Red Sea during the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935–36. They returned to the Hong Kong in mid-1936 and remained there until World War II began. Diamond {{was in the midst of}} a refit that lasted until November, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the flotilla was immediately transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet. Daring was kept in the Red Sea for escort duties until November, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the flotilla was used on contraband patrol duties upon arrival. They all needed repairs which were made before the end of the year.|$|E
5|$|Following relegation in 1980, Bolton signed former Manchester United European Cup winning striker Brian Kidd from Everton for £150,000 as they {{prepared}} to challenge {{for a quick}} return to the First Division. Kidd scored a hat-trick in his third game for Bolton, a 4–0 win over Newcastle United in the league, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the season was a struggle as Bolton finished close to the relegation places. By {{the end of the}} 1981–82 season, Bolton were no closer to promotion and had lost several key players including Peter Reid and Neil Whatmore. The following season Bolton were relegated to the Third Division after losing 4–1 at Charlton Athletic on the final day.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the confusion and loss of leadership aboard the American vessel, the British boarding party was being effectively organised. A number of small-arms men rushed aboard Chesapeake, led by Broke, including the purser, Mr G. Aldham, and the clerk, Mr John Dunn. Aldham and Dunn were killed as they crossed the gangway, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the party made it onto Chesapeake. Captain Broke, {{at the head of}} not more than twenty men, stepped from the rail of the waist-hammock netting onto the muzzle of the after-carronade of Chesapeake, and from there he jumped down to her quarterdeck. As the British boarded there were no American officers left on the quarterdeck to organise resistance.|$|E

In the Cayman Islands, rain flooded roads and there were high waves along the coast, but no deaths or serious injuries were reported. There were localized power outages and the water supply was shut off briefly, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the island's infrastructure was unaffected.

5|$|St Paul's, {{commonly}} known as the Actors' Church, was built in 1633, at a cost of £4,000, though was not consecrated until 1638. In 1645 Covent Garden was made a separate parish and the church was dedicated to St Paul. How much of Jones's original building is left is unclear, as the church was damaged by fire in 1795 during restoration work by Thomas Hardwick; the columns are thought to be original <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> is mostly Georgian or Victorian reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|Swedbank Stadion has {{an overall}} {{capacity}} of 24,000 spectators. It comprises four stands: the Western Stand; the Eastern Stand and the Southern Stand, {{both of which}} have two tiers; and the Northern Stand, which is terraced. The lower-right part of the Southern Stand also features terracing for away supporters, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the stand is seated. The lower tier has 10,000 seats, and the upper tier has 8,000 seats. The Northern Stand has a capacity of 6,000 standing supporters, which can be transformed into an all-seated section with a capacity of 3,000 if required. This is done for matches played by Malmö FF in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Changes in intragastric {{pressure}} after dorsal truncal vagotomy, {{investigated by}} {{stimulation of the}} surviving vagal branches and by step inflation of the stomach, were divided into an early phase lasting five days, and a late phase continuing {{for at least three}} months. During the early phase the amplitude of vagal evoked contraction was diminished <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> pressure and <b>the</b> response to gastric inflation were increased. After the fifth day vagal evoked contractions doubled in amplitude <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> pressure and <b>the</b> response to step inflation of the stomach returned to control levels. Ventral vagotomy did not produce any substantial changes. Alterations to gastric and body weight, or to <b>the</b> relation between <b>resting</b> pressure and evoked contraction and relaxation were excluded as causes of the enhanced vagal effectiveness. Sprouting of axons into denervated territory occurred too late to explain <b>the</b> changes, <b>but</b> an increase in synaptic density within the innervated territory has not been ruled out...|$|R

5|$|The 16th-century English Reformation, {{during which}} the Church of England {{broke away from the}} {{authority}} of the pope and the Catholic Church, split the Southworth family of Samlesbury Hall. Sir John Southworth, head of the family, was a leading recusant who had been arrested several times for refusing to abandon his Catholic faith. His eldest son, also called John, did convert to the Church of England, for which he was disinherited, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the family remained staunchly Catholic.|$|E
5|$|The Anglican Church of St John the Baptist has a tower {{dating from}} the 15th century, {{although}} the upper stages are from the 17th century, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> was rebuilt in Gothic Revival style by John Pinch the younger in 1830–1831 and was extended in the 20th century with new chancel and lady chapel. It is a grade II* listed building. The churchyard includes a memorial to the 12 miners killed in 1839 when their rope was severed. St. John's {{is part of the}} Diocese of Bath and Wells.

5|$|The papal {{election}} of February 14, 1130 was convoked {{after the death}} of Pope Honorius II and resulted in a double election.

Although Anacletus had the support {{of the majority of the}} cardinals, the Catholic Church considers Innocent II as the legitimate Pope, and Anacletus II as Antipope.|$|E

5|$|The {{territory}} {{which today}} makes up Lycoming County was purchased from the Iroquois in two treaties signed at Fort Stanwix in New York: the first treaty was in 1768, {{and the second}} treaty was in 1784. The county was formed on April 13, 1795 from part of Northumberland County. The county originally contained seven townships when formed: Lower Bald Eagle, Loyalsock, Lycoming, Muncy, Nippenose, Pine Creek, and Washington. Today Pine Creek is part of Clinton County and Lower Bald Eagle is part of both Centre and Clinton counties, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> are still in Lycoming County, although many other municipalities have been formed from these since.|$|E
5|$|The tunnels were {{enlarged}} {{by removing}} {{several of the}} cast iron segments from each tunnel ring, excavating a void behind to the required new diameter and reinstalling the segments with additional packing spacers. The northern section of the C between Euston and Moorgate was closed from 8 August 1922, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the line remained open with enlargement works taking place at night. A collapse on 27 November 1923 caused when a train hit temporary shoring on the incomplete excavations near Elephant & Castle station filled the tunnel with soil. The line was briefly operated in two parts, but was completely closed on 28 November 1923.|$|E
5|$|Villa Real was now {{surrounded}} by hostile territory, and any Spanish help {{was too far}} away to be of value. The colonists quickly ran short of food and responded by taking up arms and riding against the Indians in search of food and slaves. The Indians abandoned their towns and hid their women and children in caves. The rebellious populations concentrated themselves on easily defended mountaintops. At Quetzaltepeque a lengthy battle was fought between the Tzeltal Maya and the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of a number of Spanish. The battle lasted several days, and the Spanish were supported by indigenous warriors from central Mexico. The battle eventually resulted in a Spanish victory, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the province of Chiapa remained rebellious.|$|E

5|$|Among the Democrats, Samuel J. Tilden was {{the initial}} front-runner, having been the party's nominee in the contested {{election}} of 1876. After Tilden declined a nomination {{due to his}} poor health, his supporters shifted to several other contenders. Cleveland was among the leaders in early support, and Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware, Allen G. Thurman of Ohio, Samuel Freeman Miller of Iowa, and Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts also had considerable followings, along with various favorite sons. Each {{of the other candidates}} had hindrances to his nomination: Bayard had spoken in favor of secession in 1861, making him unacceptable to Northerners; Butler, conversely, was reviled throughout the South for his actions during the Civil War; Thurman was generally well liked, but was growing old and infirm, and his views on the silver question were uncertain. Cleveland, too, had detractors—Tammany remained opposed to him—but the nature of his enemies made him still more friends. Cleveland led on the first ballot, with 392 votes out of 820. On the second ballot, Tammany threw its support behind Butler, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the delegates shifted to Cleveland, who won. Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana was selected as his running mate.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the main German units retreated through Lyon. On 2September the 36thInfantry Division arrived at Lyon {{to find the}} Maquis {{fighting}} the Milice {{with much of the}} factory areas on fire. The next day, Lyon was liberated and 2,000 Germans were captured, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> had already continued their retreat north. Lyon celebrated for two days with the Americans. The Allies made a last-ditch attempt to cut off the Germans with an offensive towards Bourg-en-Bresse by the 45thDivision and the 117thCavalry Squadron from the original Taskforce Butler. However, the 45thDivision was not able to overcome the German defenses near the town. The 117thCavalry Squadron had more success, bypassing Bourg-en-Bresse and taking Montreval and Marboz north of Bourg-en-Bresse instead. By 3September Montreval was secure, but the squadron soon found itself trapped by units from the 11thPanzer Division, which surrounded the town. As a result, the squadron was almost annihilated, and the German escape route was again open. The American units then retired to Marboz.|$|E
