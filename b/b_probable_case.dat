Aims & Objectives: This study {{was done to}} compare the severity of hypercholesterolemia and risk of CVD in classical and <b>probable</b> <b>cases</b> of heterozygous {{familial hypercholesterolemia}} in tertiary care hospitals of Karachi. This was a case-series done from June 2008 to July 2010 at Dr Ziauddin Hospital and National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi, Pakistan. Methods: Out of more than 240 patients with dyslipidemia or premature coronary artery diseases 120 patients who had primary hypercholesterolemia and {{were found to have}} total cholesterol > 230 mg/dL and LDL-C > 160 mg/dL were included in the study. All these cases had premature coronary artery diseases or had a family history of coronary artery diseases. They were grouped as classical or <b>probable</b> <b>cases</b> depending on raised LDL-C, xanthelasmas, xanthoma, premature coronary artery diseases and LDL-R gene mutations. Their blood samples were collected after twelve hours fasting. PCR was done for mutation specific primers for exons 3, 4, 9 and 14. Results: Out of these 120 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, classical cases with LDL-receptor gene mutation were 42 (35 %) and <b>probable</b> <b>cases</b> without LDL-receptor gene mutations were 78 (65 %). Eleven (27 %) of these classical cases had severe hypercholesterolemia having total cholesterol (> 290 mg/dL) and LDL-C (> 200 mg/dL) and were found to have xanthelasmas, xanthomas and arcus cornealis. Discussion/Conclusions: Amongst the HeFH patients from the tertiary care hospitals of Karachi, classical cases with tendon xanthomas and LDL receptor gene mutations had severe hypercholesterolemia with greater risk of CVD, they required more aggressive treatment. <b>Probable</b> <b>cases</b> were also at risk of CVD and needed statin therapy...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{association}} between psychobiological stress reactivity during healthy pregnancy and depressive symptoms in the early puerperium. METHODS: A sample of healthy nulliparous pregnant women (N = 57) between the ages of 21 and 35 years underwent a standardized psychosocial stress test during pregnancy. Within an average of 13 days after delivery, postpartum depressive symptoms were assessed using the German version of the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS). The sample was divided into a group with <b>probable</b> <b>cases</b> (EPDS score > 9, N = 16) and a group with probable noncases (EPDS score < or = 9, N = 41). RESULTS: The <b>probable</b> <b>case</b> group showed significantly higher cortisol responses to the stress test compared with the probable noncase group, whereas baseline levels did not differ. Additionally, women in the <b>probable</b> <b>case</b> group showed significantly higher state anxiety and lower mood state throughout the experiment. Furthermore, the <b>probable</b> <b>case</b> group showed higher stress susceptibility, higher trait anxiety, and higher levels in the Symptom Checklist. No differences were found for prior episodes of psychiatric disorders, obstetrical complications, birth weight, or mode of delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that healthy pregnant women developing postpartum depressive symptoms might already be identified during pregnancy by means of their higher cortisol reactivity and their higher psychological reactivity in response to psychosocial stress. Further investigations are required to explore whether higher psychobiological stress responses not only precede depressive symptoms within 2 weeks after birth, but might also predict postpartum major depression...|$|R

METHODS: A survey was conducted among a sample of 176 randomly selected detainees. A menu-assisted dietary recall method was used to obtain diet information from nine hospitalized detainees. A <b>probable</b> <b>case</b> patient was defined as an individual who had {{at least two of}} the following characteristics: leg edema, weakness of the extremities, poor appetite, and dyspnea. Possible case patients were those who had only one of these characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 176 survey respondents, 19 % were classified as <b>probable</b> <b>case</b> patients and 40 % as possible case patients. The mortality rate based on <b>probable</b> <b>cases</b> was 1. 1 %. Body Mass Index (BMI) was negatively associated with illness (p < 0. 0001), and length of stay in the detention center was independently positively associated with illness (p < 0. 05). The average intake of dietary thiamine among the nine hospitalized case patients who completed three-day dietary recall surveys was 0. 49 +/- 0. 1 mg/day.
