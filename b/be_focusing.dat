5|$|The {{committee}} was reliant on public donations and realised {{that it was}} unlikely to raise a large sum of money as communities across Devon would <b>be</b> <b>focusing</b> on their own commemorations and commissioning individual war memorials. Despite this, the {{committee was}} determined to erect some sort of memorial to the county's war dead, and as a compromise sought a simple but elegant monument. They commissioned Lutyens in 1920 and opted for his War Cross design. The committee considered several potential sites, including Cawsand Beacon on Dartmoor and the Haldon Hills in south Devon, but the committee's preferred location was the cathedral close of Exeter, Devon's county town. The specific site was chosen so that the memorial would be visible from the High Street and Broadgate. With its remaining funds, the Devon County War Memorial Committee supported {{the construction of a}} battlefield memorial at La Ville-aux-Bois-lès-Pontavert in France to honour the 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment, who endured particularly heavy fighting at Bois des Buttes during the Third Battle of the Aisne.|$|E

Leo responds by sitting her out for the next press briefing, and she reacts by offering her resignation. Yet she is eventually persuaded to stay by the president's heartfelt assurance that he considers her a vital member of the administration.|$|E

While he was giving evidence to the inquiry, 20,000 people took part in a demonstration demanding his return to Sierra Leone, and upon his arrival at Lungi airport, he was appointed an honorary Paramount Chief—becoming only the third person to be granted the honour since Sierra Leone's independence—and was greeted by large crowds. Shortly after his return, Penfold was again summoned back to London to face an investigation by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee. He gave evidence in a televised session in which he stated his belief that the Sandline controversy was a peripheral issue and that the FCO should <b>be</b> <b>focusing</b> on supporting the newly restored Kabbah government. The committee's report expressed concern about Penfold's role with regard to Sandline, but believed he [...] "acted as he thought was {{in the best interests of}} the United Kingdom and of Sierra Leone, and that he did not consider that his actions went beyond government policy". Penfold stated after his retirement that he felt Sierra Leone became a [...] "political football" [...] in the UK and that, had the FCO's focus not been distracted by the Sandline issue, later problems in Sierra Leone might have been avoided.|$|E
