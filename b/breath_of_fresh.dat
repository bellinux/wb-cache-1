25|$|During {{the time}} Burial was released, Extol was {{described}} as Norway's second best band by the Norwegian magazine Scream. The album was considered a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air in the death metal genre that had run stale for years. It received good reviews from the secular metal press.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile Valdobrev {{attended}} the High School for Foreign Languages in Stara Zagora. For a Communist country behind the Iron Curtain which Bulgaria {{was at that}} time, this school was like a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air – with a discipline not so strict and teachers being lenient and having a personal approach {{to each of the}} students. They soon noticed Valdobrev's wandering mind and lack of concentration in class and created a system which tried to help him study the English language better. They gave him constant tasks to listen to and write down lyrics of new songs, perform them with his guitar in the lessons and translate the words for his classmates. These everyday concerts were the real productive education for him and later, when he was traveling over the Black Sea resorts and Germany as a street musician, he already had a set-list of 300 prepared and well-rehearsed world hit songs of any genre.|$|E
500|$|The review {{aggregator}} website Rotten Tomatoes {{reported a}} 73% approval rating {{with an average}} rating of 6.5/10 based on 278 reviews.

[...] Metacritic gave the film 57/100 based on a normalized rating of 40 reviews.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{its release}} in the United States Variety praised {{the film as}} an [...] "extravagant piece of science fiction. Despite its obvious horror angles, {{production}} is crammed with incident and suspense".

The incomes obtained from the privatisation processes represented real <b>breaths</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air for the economy. Today we notice the existence of hundreds of minority interests that are still waiting for a method of trading. The goal of the present study is to substantiate a solution to capitalize these minority packages of shares interests starting with the analysis of the current situation. The idea we try to develop refers to an indirect privatisation by creating a company listed on a regulated market, which will manage and trade the minoritypackages of shares in a transparent and competitive way, thus bringing added value in the economy...|$|R

60|$|James {{had gone}} out. He wandered along the silent roads, taking in large <b>breaths</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fresh</b> air, for his home {{affected}} {{him like a}} hot-house.

He felt sometimes as though a weight were placed upon his head, that pressed him down, and pressed him down till he seemed almost forced to his knees.|$|R

500|$|McCartney's {{refusal to}} have the release of his eponymous first solo album delayed until after Let It Be led to him announcing his {{departure}} from the band on 9 April 1970, and to Harrison finally deciding to make an album of his many unused songs from the Beatles' later years. He subsequently described the process of recording his songs with outside musicians as [...] "a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air". Shortly before starting work on the album, Harrison gave a radio interview to Village Voice reporter Howard Smith, and explained that, although he had some ideological differences with Lennon, his objection to any possible Beatles reunion was based solely on his musical differences with McCartney.|$|E
500|$|The most {{discussed}} {{track of}} the album among reviewers was [...] "Impossible Soul", which at 25 minutes in length comprises {{a third of the}} overall album. Pitchforks reviewer Ryan Dombal described the track as having [...] "more engaging ideas than most artists could muster in a career", although No Ripcord reviewer Alan Shulman criticized the middle sections as being an [...] "epic train wreck", saying that the closing minutes come as [...] "a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air". One Thirty BPM reviewer Rob Hakimian was mixed in his reception of the track, and commented that it would [...] "make or break" [...] the album for listeners, describing it as a successful [...] "proclamation of love", but also [...] "bloated" [...] and [...] "way over the top".|$|E
60|$|That was {{a remarkably}} big desert. There {{was nothing to}} relieve the monotony of view and every minute seemed an hour and every hour a day. Disagreeable fumes and gases rose from the sands, {{which would have been}} deadly to the {{travelers}} had they not been so high in the air. As it was, Trot was beginning to feel sick, when a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresher</b> air filled her nostrils and on looking ahead she saw a great cloud of pink-tinted mist. Even while she wondered what it could be, the Ork plunged boldly into the mist and the other birds followed. She could see nothing for a time, nor could the bird which carried her see where the Ork had gone, but it kept flying as sturdily as ever and in a few moments the mist was passed and the girl saw a most beautiful landscape spread out below her, extending as far as her eye could reach.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked around}} upon the green {{fields and the}} waving grain, and drew in deep <b>breaths</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fresh</b> country air, and was happy for almost {{the first time in}} her little life. By and by she lay back upon the straw and fell asleep; and the farmer, who did not know she was in his cart, drove on for many miles, until at last he stopped at a small wooden farmhouse, and jumped to the ground.|$|R
60|$|She wandered {{somewhat}} aimlessly {{through the}} halls, {{for the great}} lords were {{not yet ready to}} appear before her, and as she crossed the atrium and went into the peristylium, looking with somewhat wistful longing toward the open portals of the vestibule and the vista of open air and sky from whence a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> pure <b>fresh</b> air struck pleasingly on her nostrils, she saw that in spite of the early hour a large number of the poorer clients, suppliants {{at the door of the}} great Augusta, had already assembled there.|$|R
500|$|More recently, Clayson has {{described}} [...] "Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp" [...] as [...] "ouched in mediaeval expression" [...] {{and the most}} [...] "Beatle-esque" [...] of all the songs found on All Things Must Pass, featuring an arrangement that is [...] "a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air". Former Mojo editor Mat Snow also acknowledges the cryptic quality of the lyrics – [...] "unless one happened to know that George and Pattie had just moved to... a magnificent Gothic pile near Henley-on-Thames" [...] – and considers the song [...] "hauntingly beautiful". Less impressed, in The Rough Guide to the Beatles, Chris Ingham deems the track [...] "drearily whimsical" [...] and {{an example of how}} [...] "the main song set [...] dips in the middle".|$|E
500|$|Released on November 16, 2012, Omen {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics. They highlighted the drumming on the album, remarking on how Børven {{was able to}} match the skill and intensity of Blomberg. Steven Ecott of Cross Rhythms praised the drumming, guitar work, and harsh vocals. He concluded that [...] "'Omen' is a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air in the rather stale and stuffy room that black metal finds itself resting." [...] Scott Waters of HM wrote that [...] "the musicianship is beyond reproach. To simply play that fast and accurate, even for four-minute spurts, requires more than just talent. It requires skill and endurance. Much of the music on Omen display that skill and endurance and definitely accomplishes what it set out to do." ...|$|E
500|$|The combat {{mechanics}} of the game received praise. Daniel Hindes of GameSpot felt that the intensity and variety of the combat in the game has granted the series [...] "a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air", and believes that it managed to fulfill his nostalgic expectations from the series. Metros David Jenkins said that the combat in the game is the [...] "real deal", naming {{it one of the}} best recent single-player shooter games, while Ryan Taljonick of GamesRadar called it [...] "satisfying". Simon Miller of VideoGamer.com lauded the game's shooting and stealth mechanics, naming the former as [...] "solid". Similarly, GameSpot's Hindes noted that the stealth was [...] "simple but effective", and named it {{one of the best things}} about the game. Steve Boxer of The Guardian also called out the stealth, calling it [...] "decent".|$|E
6000|$|The fog {{drove down}} on each laboring crew, Veiled each from each {{and the sky}} and shore: There was not a sound but the breath they drew, And the lap of water and creak of oar; [...] And they felt the <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> the downs, <b>fresh</b> blown [...] O'er leagues of clover and cold gray stone, [...] But not from the lips that had gone before.|$|R
60|$|Grace {{met him at}} {{a little}} {{distance}} from the house, whither she had walked with Bella, for a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fresh</b> air after her long day in the sick-room, and did not find him the boisterous and jovial Hoosier she had imagined him. It was, in fact, hardly the moment {{for the expression of}} Western humor. He arrived a sleep-broken, travel-creased figure, with more than the Western man's usual indifference to dress; with sad, dull eyes, and an untrimmed beard that hung in points and tags, and thinly hid the corners of a large mouth. He took her hand laxly in his, and bowing over her from his lank height listened to her report of his wife's state, while he held his little girl on his left arm, and the child fondly pressed her cheek against his bearded face, to which he had quietly lifted her as soon as he alighted from Libby's buggy.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{too much}} change {{for some of the}} audience. She had a New Zealand accent in an era when BBC style {{received}} pronunciation was compulsory for New Zealand television presenters, and they were required to attend elocution lessons. She either refused to attend, or was let off. Hay was the first New Zealand television presenter to speak with a New Zealand accent. Journalist Veronica Schmidt recalled that “although the BBC plum was no longer stuffed in every announcer’s mouth, appearing with an entirely raw Kiwi accent was still unheard of”. Listener writer Diana Wichtel remembered her unreconstructed Kiwi vowels as [...] "depending on your point of view, the end of civilization as we knew it or a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> indigenous <b>fresh</b> air". For her part, Hay was unrepentant, telling the New Zealand Listener “I’m a New Zealander. I’m not ashamed of my New Zealand accent.”. [...] Her stint with Radio with Pictures ran for five years. She left in 1986, later recalling that, “Being a TV personality or whatever, celebrity just wasn’t me in a way…I didn’t want to be stuck.” ...|$|R
500|$|Matt Mitovich of TV Guide {{noted that}} Robbins [...] "quickly {{established}} {{herself as a}} fan favorite", describing her as: [...] "a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air in the often angsty halls of Seattle Grace." [...] Chris Monfette for IGN has opinionated that the fifth season of Grey's Anatomy was an improvement on the previous two seasons, attributing this {{in part to the}} introduction of [...] "fresh, new characters" [...] Robbins and Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). Monfette wrote that Arizona's ultimate contribution to the season was [...] "introducing the element of childcare to Seattle Grace", which in turn gave Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) [...] "a great arc". Jennifer Godwin for E! Online approved of Arizona's season six promotion to a series regular, particularly as it meant the continuation of her relationship with Callie.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} met with mostly {{favorable}} reviews. [...] On Metacritic, it was given a score of 72 out of 100 based on 21 reviews. Thom Jurek of AllMusic hailed the album as [...] "raging, forward-thinking heavy metal melding with hardcore thrash", and wrote that Christ Illusion marked a return to [...] "what made them such a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air in the first place." [...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times described the album as possessing [...] "a kind of demented gravity, and the music bears it out: {{it is the most}} concentrated, focused Slayer record in 20 years." [...] PopMatters critic Adrien Begrand called it [...] "Slayer's best album in sixteen years and their most thought-provoking work to date", and the album was placed at number 15 on PopMatters' list of The Best Metal Albums of 2006.|$|E
500|$|The Chase was {{generally}} well received by critics. Michael Tyminski of Manhattan Digest reviewed the series positively, calling it [...] "a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> air" [...] and praising Burns and Labbett {{in their respective}} roles. Tyminski added that while each question's level of difficulty is not always on par with those on other quiz shows such as Jeopardy!, the show avoids a [...] "painfully slow pace". Similarly, John Teti of The A.V. Club called the show a [...] "pretty good adaptation" [...] of its UK counterpart. While he preferred the British version of the show, saying that it had [...] "a more varied cast and stronger production values", Teti felt that the American version [...] "still holds its own." [...] The Chase was also ranked ninth on Douglas Pucci's (of TV Media Insights) list of best new television shows of 2013.|$|E
5000|$|The {{exhibition}} was reviewed favorably in several major international art publications, covered by news outlets, and {{regarded as an}} important showcase for emerging international art talents. Writing in l'Humanite, Anne Charlotte Hinet said, [...] "The real originality of 'I Dream' is to enable the gathering of all these cultures and these experiences. You would think this might create a cacophony, but it does not. The exhibition is a <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> a <b>fresh</b> air. The designer Mathieu Lehanneur has used the space in a clever and sophisticated fashion, bringing these artists {{to work together in}} respect for their world." [...] Vincent Vella remarked, [...] "Their exhibition is a reflection of our modern-day world, in which the boundaries between disciplines are breaking down. 'J'en Reve' embraces contemporary art in all forms, in all styles. Here it means everything, including painting, video, installations, photography and fashion, proposing a vision that is global, nonexclusive, unprejudiced. The work selected shows the vitality, talent and spirit of youth. It shows how an artist living in Buenos Aires, New-York, Tokyo, or Paris perceives the world by our times." ...|$|R
60|$|Burton slept {{that night}} under a gorse bush. He was no sooner {{alone on the}} great unlit Common with its vast sense of spaciousness, its cool silence, its splendid dome of starlit sky, than all his anger and {{disappointment}} seemed to pass away. The white, threatening faces of the professor and Mr. Bomford no longer haunted him. Even the memory of Edith herself tugged no longer at his heartstrings. He slept almost like a child, and awoke to look out upon a million points of sunlight sparkling in the dewdrops. A delicious west wind was blowing. Little piled-up masses of white cloud had been scattered across the blue sky. Even the gorse bushes creaked and quivered. The fir trees in a little spinney close at hand were twisted into all manners of shapes. Burton listened to their music for a few minutes, and exchanged civilities with a dapple-breasted thrush seated on a clump of heather a few yards away. Then he rose to his feet, took in a long <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fresh</b> morning air, and started briskly across the Common towards the nearest railway station.|$|R
60|$|He {{saw before}} {{him a great}} walled {{enclosure}} roofed by a lofty azure dome, and beyond the walls the tops of green trees swaying gently in the soft breezes. His nostrils tasted the incense <b>of</b> <b>fresh</b> earth and growing things. For {{the first time he}} felt the <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> Nature, free and unconfined, upon his brow.|$|R
