Conversely, if the A-REIT traded at a discount to its NTA, it was considered to be trading at a discount to the realisable value of its underlying assets.

40|$|Economic {{recession}} {{has led to}} the worsening of financial results of many Lat-vian companies. In this situation, cash flows from the use of assets in economic activities turn out to be insufficient to recover the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>value</b> of those as-sets. The laws and accounting standards of Latvia do not provide sufficient guid-ance on how the decrease in value should be calculated because cash flows gener-ated by individual items of fixed assets cannot be estimated reliably in most cases. In the present economic situation it seems reasonable to follow the rule that when the market value of assets is lower than their <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>value</b> it is necessary to recognize an impairment loss or to carry out their revaluation, which will allow their true value to be calculated. Annual revaluation is necessary for those items whose true value is changeable. For items whose values change rarely revaluation can be done less frequently. In the economic situation of Latvia almost every com-pany, excepting only some production areas, is facing a high risk of decrease in the value of its assets.

Methodology/methods This study used the quantitative case study approach, financial statement (data) analysis, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, the Mann-Whitney test, and the monographic method.

A current revaluation is likely to reflect a large increase in value. The increase would be added to a {{revaluation reserve}}.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, Shaista and Sara (2014), {{evaluated}} {{and found a}} positive correlation between CSR and organizational performance. Evidence from research indicates that CSR is associated with profitability, and contributes to employee commitment and customer loyalty (Fraedrich and Ferrell 2008; Friday 2015). This profitability can be measured in terms of financial performance and non-financial performance. While financial performance calculates only financial measures; non-financial performance tries to measure the intangible benefits for the company such as corporate reputation and image (Schwaiger 2004) increased employee motivation (Epstein and Roy 2001), improved brand image (Heal 2005) and the like (Mishra and Suar 2010). Today, business performance is no longer measured only in terms of the <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>value,</b> but by the positive impact of business on the shareholders and other relevant publics (Friday 2015). Infact, there has been an abundance of management accounting literature highlighting the inadequacies of relying primarily on financial performance measures for performance measurement and evaluation (e.g., Kaplan 1984; Bromwich and Bhimani 1994; Abdel-Maksoud et al. 2005; Lau and Martin-Sardesai 2012). By filling in the gaps left by financial accounting, nonfinancial measures promise to complete the picture of a company’s performance (Ittner and Larcker 2003).|$|E
40|$|We use the British {{real estate}} and {{investment}} fund industries as experimental settings where historic cost (HC) and fair value accounting (FVA) can be compared. Both industries have {{the majority of their}} assets marked to market and hence {{the difference between the two}} accounting systems is profound. However, as the valuation of real estate is arguably more subjective than that of investment funds, we are able to contrast fair value accounting in a near ideal setting with one where it remains important, but where valuation difficulties may permit bias. As this distinction is incorporated in the recently issued SFAS 157, which also formed the basis of the IASB's relevant discussion document, the results of our study may be particularly timely. As expected, we find that fair value income is considerably more value relevant than historic cost income. However, in the presence of changes in FVA <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>values,</b> income measures become largely irrelevant. This implies that there is no obvious advantage from adopting FVA income accounting if FVA <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>values</b> are available to the user. Furthermore, FVA for our real estate sample is considerably less value relevant than for the investment companies and the evidence for this sample, if not conclusive, is consistent with earnings management. We interpret these results as confirming that fair values are highly relevant and largely unbiased where the values are unambiguous. Where valuation is ambiguous, which will normally be the case, value relevance will be lower and biased accounting may be revealed. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} detection, {{processes}} and capital market impact of corporate fraud in China. Three specific issues are researched in the Chinese context through three interconnected essays: {{the identification of}} fraudulent financial statements; the measurement of illegal tunnelling of company funds by controlling shareholders; {{the evaluation of the}} stock market response to the public exposure of firm fraud violations. First, the link between accounting <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>values</b> and the exposure of fraudulent activities in Chinese firms is investigated. Other receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses, employee benefits payables and long-term payables are found to be important indicators of fraudulent Chinese financial statements. The findings from previous studies that document asset accounts that are associated with fraudulent financial statements are confirmed, but previous evidence that overstates the value of total liabilities is challenged. A new model applied to all Chinese listed firms correctly predicts the absence of fraud approximately 81 % of the time. <b>Balance</b> <b>sheet</b> accounting <b>values</b> scaled by total assets or sales are found to provide valuable information to predict fraudulent financial statements. Next, valuable insights are provided into the factors and processes surrounding cash tunnelling, a form of embezzlement by controlling shareholders, in firms accused of fraud. The controlling shareholder‘s financial motivation for tunnelling is found to be negatively related to the percentage of shareholdings of the top owner, the profitability of the firm, and the costs of tunnelling. A new theoretical model of cash tunnelling is developed, through which the process of tunnelling in the Chinese market is revealed. The overall tunnelling loss in the sample of fraudulent firms is about 5. 54 times that of net income. Lastly, long-term market responses surrounding announcements of firm fraud are investigated. Although fraudulent firms are shown to display worse operating performance, lower dividends and higher other equity distributions than matching firms, long-term abnormal stock returns following the fraud announcements are insignificant. This is consistent with a view that stock market prices in China do not fully reflect the losses incurred by fraudulent firms and that in this regard, the stock market in China is not fully efficient...|$|R
