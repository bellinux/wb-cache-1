5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula aromatic peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in <b>biocatalysis.</b> In general, enzymes that catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catechol, and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme has other potential for use as a biosensor for aromatic substances in environmental analysis and drug monitoring.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{the enzyme}} furfural/HMF {{oxidoreductase}} was {{isolated from the}} bacterium Cupriavidus basilensis HMF14. This enzyme is able to convert HMF to FDCA using molecular oxygen. A Pseudomonas putida strain that was genetically engineered to express this enzyme can completely and selectively convert HMF to FDCA. This <b>biocatalysis</b> is performed in water, at ambient temperature and pressure, without toxic or polluting chemicals, making it very environmentally friendly.|$|E

He donated over £5m since 2001. In 2006, the Department of Drama completed a major renovation with the construction {{of the state of the}} art Alexander Building, named after the university's former Chancellor Lord Alexander. The Department of Biosciences is based in three buildings on the Streatham Campus: Geoffrey Pope, the Henry Wellcome building for <b>Biocatalysis</b> and the Hatherly Laboratories. The department has recently received significant investment to further develop its facilities, particularly with improvements to the Geoffrey Pope building.|$|E
25|$|Ionic liquids {{are often}} {{moderate}} to poor conductors of electricity, non-ionizing (e.g., non-polar), highly viscous and frequently exhibit low vapor pressure. Their other properties are diverse: many have low combustibility, are thermally stable, with wide liquid regions, and favorable solvating properties {{for a range}} of polar and non-polar compounds. Many classes of chemical reactions, such as Diels-Alder reactions and Friedel-Crafts reactions, can be performed using ionic liquids as solvents. IL's can serve as solvents for <b>biocatalysis.</b> The miscibility of ionic liquids with water or organic solvents varies with side chain lengths on the cation and with choice of anion. They can be functionalized to act as acids, bases, or ligands, and are precursors salts in the preparation of stable carbenes. They have recently been found to hydrolyse, affording acidic or basic media in the aqueous milieu. Because of their distinctive properties, ionic liquids are attracting increasing attention in many fields, including organic chemistry, electrochemistry, catalysis, physical chemistry, and engineering; see for instance magnetic ionic liquid.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} recent of Rensselaer's {{research}} centers is the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies, a 218,000 square-foot research facility and a national pacesetter for fundamental and applied research in biotechnology. The primary target of the research center is biologics, a research priority based on data-driven understanding of proteomics, protein regulation, and gene regulation. It involves using <b>biocatalysis</b> and synthetic biology tools to block or supplement the actions of specific cells or proteins in the immune system. Over the past decade, CBIS has produced over 2,000 peer-reviewed publications with over 30,000 citations and currently employs over 200 scientists and engineers. The center is also used primarily to train undergraduate and graduate students, with over 1,000 undergraduates and 200 doctoral students trained. The center also has numerous academic and industry partners including the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. These partnerships have resulted in numerous advances over the last decade through new commercial developments in diagnostics, therapeutics, medical devices, and regenerative medicine which are a direct result of research at the center. Examples of advancements include the creation of synthetic heparin, antimicrobial coatings, detoxification chemotherapy, on-demand bio-medicine, implantable sensors, and 3D cellular array chips.|$|E
