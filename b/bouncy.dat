5|$|Pathan gained {{selection}} for the 2007–08 tour of Australia, {{but did not}} play {{in the first two}} Tests with only two pacemen chosen. Zaheer and Singh were the first-choice pace duo before the former was injured and replaced by Ishant, who had taken five wickets in the first innings of the Bangalore Test. With the Third Test held on the <b>bouncy</b> WACA Ground in Perth, Pathan replaced second spinner Harbhajan Singh. He batted well with scores of 28 and 46 respectively. His second innings performance came as a nightwatchman in order to shield other batsmen from the new ball late in the second day. After entering at the fall of the first wicket, he batted {{for more than two hours}} and was the sixth man to fall. Pathan rediscovered his ability to swing the ball, taking 2/63 and 3/54, including both Australian openers in each innings, having the hosts two wickets down in both innings before 50 runs had been scored. He had four of his victims caught behind the wicket off an edge and trapped Chris Rogers lbw. India won by 72 runs and Pathan was recognised with the man of the match award.|$|E

50|$|Spanish Archer {{was heavily}} criticised, {{along with other}} L!ve TV shows such as Topless Darts and Britain's <b>Bounciest</b> Weather, as being an extreme example of dumbed-down or tabloid television. Despite that it gained a huge cult following.|$|R
25|$|Mohinder {{made his}} first test century at Perth at the WACA (the fastest and <b>bounciest</b> wicket in the world) batting against Jeff Thomson at his fastest. He {{followed}} this test century with another 10 more against top class fast bowling.|$|R
50|$|The first {{movement}} is in sonata form. This movement {{has one of}} the <b>bounciest,</b> happiest melodies to be found in his violin sonatas. The second {{movement is}} in a theme and variations form. This movement is more somber than the opening movement, being at a slower tempo and having a more subdued melody.|$|R
5|$|Starting {{with a free}} plot {{of land in the}} United Kingdom and {{few hundred}} {{thousand}} pounds, the player must build a profitable amusement park. Money is spent on building rides, shops, and staff, and earned through sale of entry tickets, merchandise, and refreshments. Shops available include those selling foodstuff (such as ice creams) or soft drinks, and games such as coconut shies and arcades. Their attributes can be customised, which may affect customers' behaviour: for example, affecting the flavour of foods (e.g. by altering the amount of sugar and ice cream contains) may affect customers' enticements to return. Facilities such as toilets, and items that enhance the park's scenery (such as trees and fountains) can be purchased. Over thirty attractions, ranging in complexity from the <b>bouncy</b> castle and tree house to more complicated and expensive rides such as the roller coaster and Ferris wheel are available. Also available as rides are shows (called 'acts') with themes such as clowns and mediaeval. Certain rides, such as roller coasters, require a track to be laid out. The ride complement varies between platforms: for example, the PlayStation version is missing the mediaeval and dolphin shows. Rides require regular maintenance: if neglected for too long they will explode. Depending on the platform, it is possible to tour the park or the rides.|$|E
25|$|Dracula was {{performed}} entirely on a <b>Bouncy</b> Castle at the 2008 Edinburgh Fringe Festival. <b>Bouncy</b> Castle Dracula {{was produced by}} The Strolling Theatricals, the company behind íts 'Bouncy Castle Hamlet and <b>Bouncy</b> Castle Macbeth, which featured on ITV's 'Britain's Got Talent'.|$|E
25|$|Not to be {{confused}} with <b>bouncy</b> house / donk.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{commonly}} found in its four-chord version (including the chord in parentheses). [...] This {{may be perceived as}} a, [...] "harder, <b>bouncier</b> sounding progression," [...] than the diatonic vi-ii-V7-I (in C: Am-Dm-G7-C). [...] The three-chord version (II-V-I) is [...] "related to the cadential progression IV-V-I...in which the V is tonicized and stabilized by means of II with a raised third." ...|$|R
5000|$|A notable {{coincidence}} {{occurred in}} which, at {{around the same}} time, the British art rock group Roxy Music released an unrelated song named [...] "Angel Eyes". That track was composed by musicians Bryan Ferry and Andy Mackay. The two songs possess some lyrical similarities although the Roxy Music piece features a <b>bouncier,</b> more upbeat reminiscent of contemporary pop rock; both ended up becoming major UK hits almost contemporaneously.|$|R
25|$|The pitch at the WACA is {{regarded}} as one of the quickest and <b>bounciest</b> in the world. These characteristics, in combination with the afternoon sea-breezes which regularly pass the ground (the Fremantle Doctor), have historically made the ground an attractive place for pace and swing bowlers. The outfield is exceptionally fast, contributing to the ground seeing some very fast scoring – as of February 2016, four of the nine fastest Test centuries have been scored at the WACA.|$|R
25|$|<b>Bouncy</b> techno {{had already}} been {{supported}} in small numbers at raves in England by the like of DJs Brisk, Chris C and Ramos.|$|E
25|$|Several happy breakbeat labels created offshoots {{dedicated}} to <b>bouncy</b> techno, such as Bounce! Records from Happy Vibes Recordings in late 1995. These labels would quickly become redundant as happy breakbeat itself {{developed in a}} similar light.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, {{during summer}} festivals and {{religious}} holidays (ennichi), a traditional game called goldfish scooping is played, {{in which a}} player scoops goldfish from a basin with a special scooper. Sometimes <b>bouncy</b> balls are substituted for goldfish.|$|E
50|$|Britain's <b>Bounciest</b> Weather is {{a weather}} {{forecast}} segment that appeared on British cable television channel L!VE TV from 1995 to 1999. The weather forecast was presented by dwarf actor and entertainer Rusty Goffe, bouncing on a trampoline {{next to the}} weather map: for weather in the more northerly {{parts of the country}} he had to bounce higher to point to the relevant part of the map. The segment was shown at weekends as an alternative to The Weather in Norwegian on weekdays.|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} of bowing a Hardingfele also {{differs from that}} used with a violin. It's a smoother, <b>bouncier</b> style of bowing, with a lighter touch. The player usually bows {{on two of the}} upper strings at a time, and sometimes three. This is made easy by the relative flatness of the bridge, unlike the more curved bridge on a violin. The strings of the fiddle are slimmer than those of the violin, resembling the strings of violins from the baroque period.|$|R
5000|$|Consequence of Sound {{wrote that}} the album was [...] "more {{deliberately}} articulated" [...] than previous releases, comparing the style to The New Pornographers and Interpol. The reviewer for Under the Radar found Days of Abandon to be remiscent of 1980s jangle pop [...] "somewhere between The Smiths and The Cure's <b>bouncier</b> hits." [...] In a joint review by 10 Sonic Seducer writers, the critics compared the album to The Cure, The Smiths and New Order but also criticised it for being too shallow.|$|R
25|$|Brighton, February 14, 1996. Protest publicised {{in part by}} Justice? & SchNEWS closes {{a section}} of the North Laine area of Brighton. A <b>bouncy</b> castle is erected in a {{crossing}} and traffic is stopped for most of the afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Throwback {{events had}} also {{appeared}} in the 2000s such as Back to the Future and Fantazia in Scotland, and Happy Hardcore in Netherlands. Kutski dedicated several sets to <b>bouncy</b> techno on his BBC Radio 1 show, like the Rezerection Free Range Mix in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Producers {{picked up}} on Brown's lead, as others had done in the past. In the early 2000s, labels that {{included}} Quosh Records and Higher Order Recordings would release music with a <b>bouncy</b> techno influence. These would be subsumed into what became generically known as UK hardcore.|$|E
5000|$|The album {{received}} a favourable {{review in the}} now defunct music paper Superpop, stating: [...] "The group are at their best on the <b>bouncier</b> numbers and [...] "Willie", [...] "Got a Funny Feeling" [...] and [...] "Andy McDougal" [...] are the pick of this platter. The only criticism I have of Singing a Song is that on several numbers the group sound stilted - a fault that is not evident in their very entertaining live show or any of their past single smashes".|$|R
5000|$|... 'Can't Say No' is {{more than}} likely to set the Brighton-born lad down a similar path Justin Bieber. [...] "Some girls are naughty, some girls are sweet/ One thing they got in common, they all got a hold on me," [...] he croons over buzzing bass and crisp beats, before things tumble into an ear-grabbing chorus <b>bouncier</b> than an {{inflatable}} castle. In fact, the final result is much the same; it's playful, fun and immediately leaves you wanting another go[...]|$|R
5000|$|By 1980 Mark Seymour, on lead guitar, was {{a member}} of The Jetsonnes, a post-punk pop group formed in Melbourne, with John Archer on bass guitar; Doug Falconer on drums; Margot O'Neill on lead vocals; and Ray Tosti-Gueira on guitar. Clinton Walker {{described}} the group as [...] "lighter, <b>bouncier</b> (rather than funkier) and more infectious than other like-minded bands such as Models". They issued a split single, [...] "Newspaper", with the other side, [...] "Miniskirts in Moscow", by fellow pop group, International Exiles. The Jetsonnes, Models, and International Exiles were [...] "the first bands to rise out of Melbourne's hothouse punk, new wave explosion playing an exuberant brand of neo-pop".|$|R
25|$|Another type of urbanlining is streetlining, which {{combines}} street workout power moves with the slackline's dynamic, shaky, <b>bouncy</b> feeling. Main focus are static handstands, super splits— {{hands and feet}} together, planche, front lever, back lever, one arm handstand and other interesting extreme moves that are evolving in street workout culture.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Binney & Smith {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} Silly Putty, a stretchy <b>bouncy</b> toy. Crayola markers were introduced in 1978 {{to coincide with the}} 75th anniversary of Crayola crayons. In 1984, the company was acquired by Hallmark Cards, a privately held corporation. Colored pencils and a line of washable markers were added in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Polissian Dances, {{representing}} {{the culture and}} traditions of Polissia. The steps of Polissian dance as depicted by Ukrainian dancers are characteristically very <b>bouncy</b> and with emphasis on high knee movement. The costumes often incorporate white, red, and beige as the main colors, and girls often wear aprons. A popular Polissian dance is called mazurochky.|$|E
5000|$|Yong Peng {{is known}} for its Fuzhou (福州) style cuisine. This would include HockChew Chow Mien (handmade noodles that are first boiled, then stir fried); HockChew Egg Soup; HockChew FishBall (one of the <b>bounciest</b> fishballs; with fish on the outside and pork on the inside); Fermented Red Rice Wine Chicken; Fermented Red Rice Wine Noodles; HockChew Square Bread (typically pork fat or meat is added as filling); and HockChew plain bread (also known as Yong Peng bread - round shaped yeast bread that is {{available}} as plain with sesame seed, sweet or salted; no fillings within). The aforesaid are all classically unique food only available in Yong Peng.|$|R
2500|$|A special {{characteristic}} of slacklining is {{the ease with}} which the dynamics of the practice can be altered. Using narrow (...) webbing will result in a stretchier slackline. This allows for more sway in the line and can make a short line feel substantially longer. Wider webbing (...) is much more rigid, often creating a <b>bouncier</b> slackline optimal for aerial tricks. The tension of the line will also increase or decrease the sway of the line. Weight due to the different methods of tensioning will also vary the performance of a slackline. A comealong and a ratchet will both add enough weight to allow the feedback from quick movements on shorter slacklines to be felt.|$|R
2500|$|A {{more ambitious}} band, The Jetsonnes, {{followed}} in September 1979, {{with the addition}} of Ray Tosti-Gueira on guitar and backing vocals. According to music journalist, Clinton Walker, The Jetsonnes had a [...] "clever post-punk pop sound was lighter, <b>bouncier</b> (rather than funkier) and more infectious than other like-minded bands". Their only released track is [...] "Newspaper" [...] which was one side of a gig give away split single in June 1980 with [...] "Miniskirts in Moscow" [...] by fellow pop group, International Exiles, as the other. By September that year The Jetsonnes had disbanded but Archer, Falconer, Miles, Seymour and Tosti-Gueira decided to continue with new members, Geoff Crosby on keyboards and Greg Perano (ex-True Wheels) on percussion to form a new band.|$|R
