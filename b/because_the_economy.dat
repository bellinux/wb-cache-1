2500|$|Some {{believed}} {{it was a bad}} time to demand a wage hike, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> hadn't yet fully recovered from the downturn. One mine owner claimed [...] "we have not made a dollar in two years." [...] But others observed that by 1895, Leadville mines posted their largest combined output since 1889, and that Leadville was then Colorado's most productive mine camp, producing almost 9.5 million ounces of silver. The mine owners [...] "were doing a lot better than they wanted anyone to know." [...] Mine owners Eben Smith and John F. Campion were writing letters discussing mine expansions and upgrading operations, such that [...] "both men seemed, in their writing at least, to remain remarkably unconcerned about their overall financial prospects." [...] Campion was attempting to purchase Italian marble, and other luxuries for his home during the strike.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Qing dynasty {{established}} by the Manchus had quickly seized Beijing in 1644, hostile regimes still existed {{in other parts of}} China, and it would take the Qing a few decades to take control of all of China. During this period, especially in the 1640s and 1650s, people died of starvation and disease, which resulted in a decline in population. In 1661, facing attacks by overseas Ming loyalist forces, the Qing government adopted a policy of clearing the shore line, which ordered all people residing along the coast of Zhejiang to the border with Vietnam to move [...] inland and guards were positioned on the coast to prevent anyone from living there. Thus, until 1685 few people engaged in coastal and foreign trade. During these decades, although grain harvests improved, few participated in the market <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> had contracted and local prices hit bottom. Tang Chen, a retired Chinese scholar and failed merchant described a dismal picture of the market economy of the preceding decades in his writing in the early 1690s.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{development}} of railways in the Province of Canada, {{which consisted of}} Lower Canada (Quebec) and Upper Canada (Ontario), was delayed by lack of capital and industrial infrastructure. The first major national railway development was {{the construction of the}} Grand Trunk Railway of Canada on a gauge of [...] from Portland, Maine to Sarnia, Canada West via Montreal and Toronto, with a branch from Richmond to Levis near Quebec City. Investment funds for railways were scarce in the Dominion of Canada <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> was mainly agricultural, and most capital was tied up in land. The line was constructed by the English contractors Peto, Brassey and Betts, who undertook to raise the capital required in London if they obtained the contract. As a result of the exorbitant cost of land and charters, overbuilding stone bridges and stations to English standards, and initial lack of traffic to support the capital cost.... the line was soon insolvent. This failure together with a severe recession, and the US Civil War meant that no more capital could be raised and almost no railways were built in Canada during the 1860s.|$|E

50|$|Primitive socialist {{accumulation}} (sometimes socialist accumulation) was {{a concept}} put {{forth in the}} early Soviet Union {{during the period of}} the New Economic Policy. It was developed as a counterpart to the process of the primitive accumulation of capital that took place during the early stages and development of capitalist <b>economies.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> Soviet <b>economy</b> was underdeveloped and largely agrarian in nature, the Soviet state would have to be the agent of primitive capital accumulation to rapidly develop <b>the</b> Soviet <b>economy.</b> <b>The</b> concept was proposed as a means to industrialize <b>the</b> Russian <b>economy</b> of <b>the</b> era through state capitalism, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Russian <b>economy</b> was too underdeveloped to implement socialism at the time.|$|R

50|$|Economic aspects are clearest, perhaps <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> is {{most easily}} {{associated}} with capitalism.

50|$|A persistent, large {{output gap}} has severe {{consequences}} for, among other things, a country's labor market, a country's long-run economic potential, and a country's public finances. First, {{the longer the}} output gap persists, the longer the labor market will underperform, as output gaps indicate that workers {{who would like to}} work are instead idled <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> is not producing to capacity.
