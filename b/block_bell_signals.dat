5000|$|After an interval, {{the train}} will arrive and pass B; {{as it does}} so, B sends [...] "Train Entering Section" [...] on the <b>block</b> <b>bell</b> to C. Then C {{acknowledges}} the <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> and places the block instrument to [...] "Train On Line". As the train passes, he restores his signals to danger, and when {{the whole of the}} train passes B complete with tail lamp attached, B sends the [...] "Train Out Of Section" [...] <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> (2-1) to A and when A acknowledges it, he places his block indicator to [...] "Normal". The block section between A and B is now normal and A can offer B another train, if he has one.|$|R
50|$|The railway <b>block</b> <b>signalling</b> <b>bell</b> code is {{a system}} of bell rings used in Great Britain to {{communicate}} between manually operated Signal Boxes (the system is not used in modern power signal boxes, unless it is a fringe box to an older signalbox). Each signal box would have a bell circuit to the box {{on either side of}} it along the line. The equipment would consist of a plunger or tapper (rather like a Morse key) which if pressed, rings the bell in the neighbouring box. The neighbouring box would have a key for communicating back, therefore each box has a key which rings the bell in the other box. Where a signal box communicates with more than one other box (in either direction along the line, and possibly along a branch line too), each bell would have a different tone, so that the signalman could tell them apart by ear.|$|R
50|$|The <b>signalling</b> <b>bell,</b> {{also known}} as a <b>block</b> <b>bell,</b> is used in {{conjunction}} with the block instruments if the bell is not integrated with them. It is a single stroke design and relays the codes from adjacent <b>signal</b> boxes. Each <b>bell</b> has its own distinctive sound to alert the signalman which instrument needs to be attended to.|$|R

5000|$|The {{signalman}} at Pouparts Junction (T. P. G. Hillman) then {{offered the}} Coulsdon train forward. He {{should not have}} done this until he had received the [...] "Train out of Section" [...] <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> for the London Bridge train, which Childs denied strongly that he had sent. The enquiry made no definite ruling on this point - {{it was possible that}} Hillman had mistaken another <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> relating to a down train for the [...] "Train out of Section" [...] signal. However, Childs' fifth and fatal mistake then occurred. He pressed the plunger to accept the Coulsdon train, and, as the enquiry ruled, sent the acceptance <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> to Hillman. Hillman cleared his signals, and the Coulsdon train entered the occupied section at approximately 40 mph.|$|R

50|$|Several {{advances}} in the technology of fog signals were made during the 1850s. In 1851, an experimental air fog whistle and reed horn was installed at Beavertail Lighthouse {{at the entrance to}} Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. At first this sound signal was powered by a horse-operated treadmill and later by an internal combustion steam engine. Around 1851, mechanically rung fog bells were introduced. The striking mechanism was governed by a weight attached to a flywheel, and later internally run by clockworks. The strokes of the fog signals were timed deliberately to afford each signal a unique sound characteristic. The <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> was gradually replaced by three variations of that instrument. The first was an ordinary locomotive whistle, enlarged and modified and blown by steam from a high-pressured tubular boiler. The second was a reed-trumpet, and in 1866 the third variation, a siren-trumpet. Although the fog <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> was still used for warning vessels over short distances, other fog signals started to supersede the smaller <b>bell</b> <b>signal.</b> <b>Bells</b> were also used on buoys; later whistling buoys were invented by J. M. Courtenay and were first in use in 1876. The first gas-lighted buoy was installed in 1882. The gong buoy was invented in 1923.|$|R
50|$|Before Hayes {{could reach}} the signal box, the {{signalman}} at Winwick Quay to the south rang Call attention for an express train from Euston to Blackpool. As the Regulations did not permit him to send the Is Line Clear? <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> until he had received Train Out of Section for the local train, he intended to send the <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> Shunt engine for following train to pass upon acknowledgment of Call attention, i.e. he expected Bloor to switch the local train temporarily to another running line and halt it while the express passed. However, Bloor forgot that the local train was standing at his signals, and {{thought that he had}} failed to clear his block instruments after a preceding train. He gave the reply, Train out of section and cleared his signals.|$|R
50|$|Reversers {{have been}} used in New South Wales {{especially}} to put starting signals to stop. When the signal was put back to stop, the system automatically sent the train on line <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> (two <b>bells)</b> to the station in advance. This equipment would have helped prevent the Hawes Junction rail crash.|$|R

2500|$|The Gotthardbahn {{employed}} <b>signal</b> <b>bells</b> {{within its}} stations {{and along the}} line to signal any approaching train. An alarm was triggered once a train had left a neighbouring station or <b>block</b> station. These <b>signal</b> <b>bells</b> were partly installed along the line and signalled any construction worker an approaching train. In addition, any railway watchman's house and railroad crossing would be equipped with a <b>signal</b> <b>bell.</b> Southbound trains were signalled by 3 triple chimes, northbound trains by two double chimes. The signalling mechanism at each <b>signal</b> <b>bell</b> had to be manually wound up every day by station employees and railway watchmen. Part of the mechanism was a weight having to be raised by help of a pulley. The electric signal triggering the alarm operated a relay, activating the bell's hammer through force of the aforementioned weight. Each <b>signal</b> <b>bell</b> within the Gotthard railway's network is marked on the graphic timetable. The railway watchman's house number159 (Casello159) <b>signal</b> <b>bell</b> on the Monte Ceneri line between Giubiasco and Rivera-Bironico is shown as an example in the [...] A southbound train departing Giubiasco for Rivera-Bironico would trigger alarms of eleven different <b>signal</b> <b>bells</b> on its 11 kilometres long journey.
