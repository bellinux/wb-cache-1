Women were still highly employed as textile workers and domestic servants, but the clerical and service field greatly expanded. This tertiary sector was more socially acceptable and many more educated women entered. Wages were low, averaging roughly 60% of men’s and there was little room for advancement.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new version}} of the Spanish quarterly macroeconometric model. The previous version [see Willman and Estrada (2002) ] evidenced a number of shortcomings, some of which are redressed here. In particular, the model now uses seasonally and working days adjusted time series; it considers a <b>breakdown</b> <b>by</b> <b>sector</b> (government and private sectors), by external trade (euro area and rest of the world) and by investment (residential and productive); and finally, it includes wealth evaluated at market prices. While the long run properties of the old model have not changed substantially, in the short run different simulation exercises show that the new model provides stronger responses in the first two years and a prompter and faster return to the baseline values.

Then, VAR models are used—similar to those of previous studies—to analyze impulse-response functions. Finally, a comparative analysis is made on the impact of monetary policy on various productive sectors, for which output and price variables are incorporated into the traditional VAR model. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{numbers of}} {{teachers}} {{employed in the}} compulsory sector of education are declining and most reasonable assumptions expect this decline to continue beyond {{the end of the}} decade. What are the consequences of this decline for the quality of educational provision, process and performance? Moreover, are there alternatives available to existing policies for the management of this contraction which, if adopted, might assist in maintaining and improving these dimensions of educational quality? This paper will briefly describe the management processes for reducing the total stock of teachers and its distribution between sectors and schools and then use a human capital framework to analyse the consequences of the changing characteristics of the teaching force for educational outcomes. The analysis has a strong policy orientation: the management of contraction has been with us long enough to begin an evaluation of practice; but it will also be with us for several more years and there is still time to adapt existing policies as well as to adopt new ones.

40|$|Using {{the main}} {{features}} of the patent, namely the exclusion (taking place when {{the property of the}} patent is granted to a single individual or entity) and the dissemination of knowledge (when {{it is a question of}} providing information on the state of knowledge in a particular area), our aim in this study is to examine the ability of the Tunisian firms to invent and innovate in comparison to their competitors. Firstly, we point out the qualities and loopholes of the patent as an indicator of inventive and innovative activity through a review of the literature relevant to this field. We then proceed to a technological classification of the patents deposited in Tunisia, a task which has not been previously carried out, by using the databanks of the INNORPI (National Institute of Standardization and Intellectual Property). Considering patents as a stock of knowledge at the disposal of the economy, we move on to elaborate a <b>breakdown</b> <b>by</b> <b>sector</b> and product, different from the WIPO one, of patents deposited in Tunisia as of 1984. Thus we set up for the first time in Tunisia, a matrix describing the sectors source of innovation. Thirdly we exploit the findings obtained taking advantage of one of the functions of the patent, namely as an indicator of inventive and innovative activity in order t...|$|E

Furthermore, 90 % of the establishments in Medellin have less than 10 employees, and 8 % have between 11 and 50 employees.

Vaz said that “The context in which the companies implicated by Soca’s information have acted is crucial for us to understand their motives.” The bodies contacted included the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, the Law Society, the Office of Fair Trading, the Office of Rail Regulation and the Financial Conduct Authority.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a short-term projection model for French economic activity, OPTIM, {{the aim of}} which is twofold. First it gives an early estimate of real GDP growth for the previous quarter, when no figure has yet been released by Insee, the French National Statistical Institute, along with flash estimates for main GDP components (consumption, investment, inventories and external trade) together with a <b>breakdown</b> <b>by</b> <b>sectors</b> (services, manufacturing, construction, equipment, agri-food). This appears particularly useful for the short-run analysis. In this respect OPTIM may {{be considered as a}} traditional bridge equation model since it links a particular indicator available generally ahead of the release of the quarterly national accounts with a quarterly aggregate like GDP, consumption…. Second, this tool supplies also estimates for GDP growth and its main components for the current quarter and for the next quarter (i. e two and three quarters respectively following the latest reference period of Insee's GDP data release). A pool of (mainly) monthly variables is used, which are, sometimes, directly introduced in the specification but, more often, summarised by the implementation of a principal component analysis (PCA). The largest part of the set of indicators comprises survey data together with monthly traditional indicators (industrial production, consumption in manufactured goods…). But other data (in particular financial data) are also introduced. The outcomes of OPTIM rely on a relatively complex procedure involving about twenty equations and mixing two alternative approaches: a supply approach consisting in a direct modelling of GDP and a demand approach where GDP is the sum of consumption, investment, changes in stocks and net trade (exports minus imports). The discrepancy between these two estimates is distributed according to an original method, yielding a unique GDP estimation. The paper is organised as follows. Section 1 presents the main features of OPTIM. Section 2 deals with data description while section 3 addresses the data assessment's issue. In section 4, the main equations are described. Section 5 presents a general assessment of OPTIM in terms of forecasting record. Finally section 6 concludes and proposes some avenues for further developments. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{working paper}} summarises the main {{findings}} of a data collection exercise documenting {{the size of the}} national state-owned enterprise (SOE) sectors in OECD countries (in terms of number, employment and economic value of enterprises), and provides a <b>breakdown</b> <b>by</b> main <b>sectors</b> and types of incorporation. The data is based on questionnaire responses from national governments, covering the years 2008 and 2009. Twenty-seven of the Organisation. s 34 member countries have contributed to date. Employment in SOEs across the OECD area exceeds 6 million people, and that the value of all SOEs combined is close to US$ 2 trillion. In addition to this, the State in many countries holds minority stakes in listed enterprises that are large enough to confer effective control. These enterprises employ a further 3 million people and are valued at close to US$ 1 trillion. Hence, while state ownership of enterprises has declined in recent decades, SOEs and similar entities continue to account for {{a significant part of the}} corporate economy in many countries. Following decades of privatisation, the remaining SOEs have a strong sectoral concentration. Around half (in value terms) of all SOEs in OECD countries are located in the network sectors, mostly transportation, power generation and other energy. A further fourth of total valuation is accounted for by financial institutions. In addition, among the partly state-owned listed companies there are many partly privatised telecommunications companies. In other words, not only do state-invested enterprises remain significant, they are also increasingly concentrated in a few ¡°strategic¡± sectors of great importance to the competitiveness of the rest of the business sector. privatisation, state-owned enterprises, corporate governance...|$|R
