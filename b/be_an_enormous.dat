5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, heart disease had surpassed {{infectious}} disease as {{the leading cause of death}} in the United States, and it is currently the leading cause of deaths worldwide. Since 1948, the ongoing Framingham Heart Study has shed light on the effects of various influences on the heart, including diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin. Although the introduction of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers has improved the management of chronic heart failure, the disease continues to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> medical and societal burden, with 30 to 40% of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Mortal Kombat II {{proved to}} <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> {{commercial}} success {{and even a}} cultural phenomenon. WMS Industries, owner of Midway at the time, reported its 1993 sales in the quarter ending December 31 rose to $101 million from $86 million and said much of its revenue gain {{was related to the}} sale of the arcade version of MKII. By 1996, the number of arcade machines sold approached 25,000 units; at that time, arcade games that sold 5,000 units were considered strong titles (Midway printed special T-shirts to celebrate 300 machines being manufactured in one day) and an arcade cabinet cost $3,0004,000. MKII was considered an arcade game of the year, taking over from the original Mortal Kombat.|$|E

25|$|The foreign {{borrowings}} of Irish banks {{rose from}} €15 billion to €110 billion in 2004-08. Much {{of this was}} borrowed on a three-month rollover basis to fund building projects {{that would not be}} sold for several years. When the properties could not be sold due to oversupply, the result was a classic asset–liability mismatch. At the time of the bank guarantee the banks were said to be illiquid (but not insolvent) by €4 billion; this turned out to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> underestimate.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of this}} project, {{the known}} mineral and {{potential}} oil and gas deposits in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago were considered for development. Shipping the products proved to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> problem; the sea lanes were ice-free {{for only a few}} months a year, and building a railhead to even the closest suitable shore point would still require hundreds of miles of rail to be laid over tundra. A pipeline would have to cross both land and water, and was likewise considered extremely difficult to build.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish crown {{at first}} {{controlled}} the local governments indirectly, but centralized procedures {{as the time}} went on. At first, Viceroy Francisco de Toledo confirmed the rights of local nobles and guaranteed them local autonomy. But the crown eventually came to employ Spanish officials, corregidores de indios, to collect tribute and taxes from the Indians. Corregidores de indios also imported goods and forced the Indians to buy them, a widely abused practice that proved to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> source of wealth for these officials but caused much resentment among the Indian population.|$|E
25|$|Through Commodus, Marcus met Apollonius of Chalcedon, a Stoic philosopher. Apollonius {{had taught}} Commodus, and would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> impact on Marcus, {{who would later}} study with him regularly. He {{is one of only}} three people Marcus thanks the gods for having met. At about this time, Marcus' younger sister, Annia Cornificia, married Ummidius Quadratus, her first cousin. Domitia Lucilla asked Marcus to give part of his father's {{inheritance}} to his sister. He agreed to give her all of it, content as he was with his grandfather's estate.|$|E
25|$|Gutenberg greatly {{improved}} {{the process by}} treating typesetting and printing as two separate work steps. A goldsmith by profession, he created his type pieces from a lead-based alloy which suited printing purposes so well {{that it is still}} used today. The mass production of metal letters was achieved by his key invention of a special hand mould, the matrix. The Latin alphabet proved to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> advantage in the process because, in contrast to logographic writing systems, it allowed the type-setter to represent any text with a theoretical minimum of only around two dozen different letters.|$|E

25|$|She {{was born}} Hattie L. Hapgood in Los Angeles in 1916, and {{was raised in}} the Boyle Heights area by her parents who had {{migrated}} to California from the South. Her mother, Goldie Wright, was a doctor and her father, John Hapgood, a deputy sheriff. Her grandfather, Samuel Alexander Hapgood (October 22, 1857 – November 30, 1944), moved to California from Atlanta, Georgia, and proved to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> influence on Brooks. He introduced her to theater and the operatic voices of Amelita Galli-Curci and Enrico Caruso. In her youth she formally studied classical music with an Italian piano instructor, Florence Bruni, with whom she trained for twenty years.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{a radical}} {{decision}} {{to retreat to}} the south, avoiding contact, could probably have saved most of the mechanized and motorized divisions, including the BEF. However, that would have meant leaving about thirty infantry divisions to their fate. The loss of Belgium alone would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> political blow. Besides, the Allies were uncertain about German intentions. They threatened in four directions: to the north, to attack the allied main force directly; to the west, to cut it off; to the south, to occupy Paris and even to the east, to move behind the Maginot Line. The French decided {{to create a new}} reserve, among which a reconstituted 7th Army, under General Touchon, using every unit they could safely pull out of the Maginot Line to block the way to Paris.|$|E
25|$|The {{extensive}} {{gardens and}} buildings opened on 27 July 1896, {{with the introduction}} of Herr Meyer Lutz's Grand Band and under the astute management of Henry Hague, proved to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> success, with the Spa Theatre and the glass dome for ballroom dancing being the jewels in the crown. People could stay all day for sixpence. On the evening of 20 October 1906, at around 9p.m. a fire broke out. The fire spread rapidly and the building was engulfed by the time the horse-drawn fire engine arrived from its depot in Ashville Street. The fire crew, led by Chief Captain Rennard, managed to save the famous glass dome adjoining the northern end of the theatre. Plans were drawn up for a replacement by Messers Whittaker Bros and the New Spa Company, under the guidance of the architect, Mr W. S. Walker.|$|E

Kong carries her off into the jungle as the Venture crew, alerted to Ann's abduction, arrive. They open the gate and Denham, Driscoll and some volunteers enter the jungle in hopes of rescuing Ann. They soon {{discover}} that Kong {{is far from the}} only giant prehistoric creature on the island when they are charged by a Stegosaurus, which they manage to kill. After constructing a raft in order to cross a swamp, a Brontosaurus capsizes their supplies, killing several of the men. Fleeing through the jungle, they soon encounter Kong, who tries to stop them from crossing a ravine by shaking them off a fallen tree that bridges it. Only Driscoll and Denham, on opposite sides, survive.|$|E
