5|$|Nearly 4,000 {{species of}} fungi, {{including}} lichen-forming {{species have been}} recorded from Malaysia. Of the two fungal groups with {{the largest number of}} species in Malaysia, the Ascomycota and their asexual states have been surveyed in some habitats (decaying wood, marine and freshwater ecosystems, as parasites of some plants, and as agents of biodegradation), but have not been or have been only poorly surveyed in other habitats (as endobionts, in soils, on dung, as human and animal pathogens); the Basidiomycota are only partly surveyed: <b>bracket</b> <b>fungi,</b> and mushrooms and toadstools have been studied, but Malaysian rust and smut fungi remain very poorly known. Without doubt, many more fungal species in Malaysia have not yet been recorded, and it is likely that many of those, when found, will be new to science.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} species of fungi {{including}} lichen-forming species, and the mycobiota is less poorly known than in {{many other parts of}} the world. The most recent checklist of Basidiomycota (<b>bracket</b> <b>fungi,</b> jelly fungi, mushrooms and toadstools, puffballs, rusts and smuts), published in 2005, accepts over 3600 species. The most recent checklist of Ascomycota (cup fungi and their allies, including most lichen-forming fungi), published in 1985, accepts another 5100 species. These two lists did not include conidial fungi (fungi mostly with affinities in the Ascomycota but known only in their asexual state) {{or any of the other}} main fungal groups (Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota and Zygomycota). The number of fungal species known very probably exceeds 10,000. There is widespread agreement among mycologists that many others are yet to be discovered.|$|E
25|$|Some fairyflies possess {{slightly}} reduced (brachypterous) {{to greatly}} reduced (micropterous) wings, while others {{may even be}} completely wingless (apterous). Wing reduction or absence are usually exhibited {{by at least one}} sex (usually the females) of species which search for host eggs in confined areas (like leaf litter, soil, or the tubules of <b>bracket</b> <b>fungi).</b> They are also exhibited by species which inhabit windy habitats like oceanic islands or in high elevations, particularly endemic species which are found in isolated habitats or are located far from the nearest mainland. In these habitats, wings would only be a hindrance to the fairyflies, so are strongly selected against in evolution. For example, the three known species of fairyflies found in the far southern islands of Campbell and Auckland of the southwestern Pacific and South Georgia of the southern Atlantic, as well as 20% of the fairyfly fauna in the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands, Norfolk Island, and Lord Howe Island, are all wingless or short-winged. While wingless and short-winged species may also be found in islands near continents and in continental habitats, they usually constitute {{only a small percentage of}} the overall number of species.|$|E

500|$|A {{saprobic}} species, {{it grows}} generally in subalpine regions, fruiting on rotten wood and damp soil, {{and can also}} sometimes be found on ashes, wet leaves or <b>bracket</b> <b>fungi.</b> In Alaska {{it has been found}} growing on humus in the tundra. A six-year study of the succession of fungal flora appearing on freshly cut stumps of Poplar trees (Populus canadensis) showed that S.scutellata appeared roughly {{in the middle of the}} fungal succession (about 24 years after the tree had been cut), along with the species Ascocoryne sarcoides, Scutellinia cervorum, and Lasiosphaeria spermoides. When growing on wood, it is often obscured by surrounding moss. Though sometimes found alone, they typically fruit in groups, sometimes forming dense clusters on rotting wood or other plant detritus. Due to its small size, it is often overlooked, but mycologist Vera Evenson has observed that [...] "the discovery of the Eyelash Cup is always a great pleasure", due to [...] "the beauty of the eyelashes". Vera McKnight describes it as [...] "a most attractive little fungus", and claims it is easy to notice due to its bright colouration.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{mushrooms}} are not gilled, so the term [...] "mushroom" [...] is loosely used, and giving a full {{account of their}} classifications is difficult. Some have pores underneath (and are usually called boletes), others have spines, such as the hedgehog mushroom and other tooth fungi, and so on. [...] "Mushroom" [...] {{has been used for}} polypores, puffballs, jelly fungi, coral fungi, <b>bracket</b> <b>fungi,</b> stinkhorns, and cup fungi. Thus, the term is more one of common application to macroscopic fungal fruiting bodies than one having precise taxonomic meaning. Approximately 14,000 species of {{mushrooms are}} described.|$|E
