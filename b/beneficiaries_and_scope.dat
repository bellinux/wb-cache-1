40|$|Summary: The {{right to}} free {{movement}} of EC nationals encompasses their right {{to be joined by}} family members and the right of these family members to be integrated into the host Member State by being granted certain rights, such as the right to obtain employment. This paper discusses the nature, <b>beneficiaries,</b> legal bases <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of the right to family reunification. The discussion offers a detailed analysis of current developments in this area, and provides answers to a number of issues raised by existing Community legislation and case law. Recent trends promulgated by the ECJ’s case law show signs of a changing approach towards family reunification, leading to an acknowledgement of the right to family life as the legal basis for family reunification in cases where movement has occurred, but cannot be used as a basis for applying Community law...|$|R
40|$|In view of {{the recent}} {{evidence}} {{that the impact of}} microfinance is being overstated, this study assesses the causal link between receiving credit from a microfinance institution and poverty reduction among rural households in the Upper East Region of Ghana. Using consumption expenditure as the outcome variable, we test the hypothesis that receiving credit has a poverty reducing effect. Treatment effect estimation technique is used to examine data on 250 <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>and</b> 250 non-beneficiaries from five Districts in the Region. Although the method of study is based on a quasi-experimental approach, the process of selecting the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>and</b> non-beneficiary sample cautiously made an attempt to minimize the potential problems that will arise from contamination, spill-over effects and programme and self-exclusion selection biases. The results support the hypothesis that microfinance has 0. 12 % poverty reducing effect. Premised on this, we conclude that even in very poor areas microfinance is capable of reducing poverty. Therefore microfinance investment is recommended to broaden the scale <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of <b>beneficiaries</b> reached <b>and</b> improve delivery strategies to suite context specific characteristics.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Promoting {{the social}} value of global health {{research}} undertaken in resource poor settings {{has become a}} key concern in global research ethics. The consideration for benefit sharing, which concerns the elucidation of what if anything, is owed to participants, their communities and host nations that take part in such research, and the obligations of researchers involved, {{is one of the}} main strategies used for promoting social value of research. In the last decade however, there has been intense debate within academic bioethics literature seeking to define the benefits, the <b>beneficiaries,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>scope</b> of obligations for providing these benefits. Although this debate may be indicative of willingness at the international level to engage with the responsibilities of researchers involved in global health research, it remains unclear which forms of benefits or beneficiaries should be considered. International and local research ethics guidelines are reviewed here to delineate the guidance they provide. Methods We reviewed documents selected from the international compilation of research ethics guidelines by the Office for Human Research Protections under the US Department of Health and Human Services. Results Access to interventions being researched, the provision of unavailable health care, capacity building for individuals and institutions, support to health care systems and access to medical and public health interventions proven effective, are the commonly recommended forms of benefits. The beneficiaries are volunteers, disease or illness affected communities and the population in general. Interestingly however, there is a divide between "global opinion" and the views of particular countries within resource poor settings as made explicit by differences in emphasis regarding the potential benefits <b>and</b> the <b>beneficiaries.</b> Conclusion Although in theory benefit sharing is widely accepted as one of the means for promoting the social value of international collaborative health research, there is less agreement amongst major guidelines on the specific responsibilities of researchers over what is ethical in promoting the social value of research. Lack of consensus might have practical implications for efforts aimed at enhancing the social value of global health research undertaken in resource poor settings. Further developments in global research ethics require more reflection, paying attention to the practical realities of implementing the ethical principles in real world context. </p...|$|R
