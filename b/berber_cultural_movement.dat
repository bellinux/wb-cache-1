50|$|Others {{argue that}} the Berber {{language}} and traditions are {{deeply rooted in the}} North African cultural mosaic; for centuries, Berber culture has survived conquests, repression, and exclusion from different invaders: Romans, Arabs, and French. Hence, believing that its identity and specificity were threatened, the Berbers took note of the political and ideological implications of Arabism as defended by successive governments. Gradual radicalization and Anti-Arab sentiments began to emerge in Algeria and among {{the hundreds of thousands of}} Berbers in France who had been in the forefront of the <b>Berber</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
50|$|While the Berber Spring {{was in the}} end violently {{suppressed}} by the Algerian authorities, it created a lasting legacy for Kabylie and the Berbers across North Africa.

The Spring was also an important event for Algeria's nascent human rights community, including outside Berber circles.|$|E
