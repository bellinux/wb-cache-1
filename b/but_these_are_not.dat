5|$|Both {{bacteria}} and eukaryotes, but not archaea, make spores. Some species of Haloarchaea undergo phenotypic switching and grow as several different cell types, including thick-walled structures that {{are resistant to}} osmotic shock and allow the archaea to survive in water at low salt concentrations, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> reproductive structures and may instead help them reach new habitats.|$|E
5|$|Canada's federal {{structure}} divides government responsibilities {{between the}} federal government and the ten provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons. Canada's three territories also have legislatures, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces. The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Phagocytes {{can also}} kill {{microbes}} by oxygen-independent methods, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{as effective as}} the oxygen-dependent ones. There are four main types. The first uses electrically charged proteins that damage the bacterium's membrane. The second type uses lysozymes; these enzymes break down the bacterial cell wall. The third type uses lactoferrins, which are present in neutrophil granules and remove essential iron from bacteria. The fourth type uses proteases and hydrolytic enzymes; these enzymes are used to digest the proteins of destroyed bacteria.|$|E

5|$|The Cape sparrow mostly eats seeds, {{foraging}} {{in trees}} {{and on the}} ground. The larger seeds of cereals, wild grasses, and other small plants are preferred, with wheat and khakiweed (Alternanthera caracasana) being favourites. Buds and soft fruits are also taken, causing considerable damage to agriculture. Insects are eaten, and nestlings seem to be fed exclusively on caterpillars. The Cape sparrow eats the soft shoots of plants, and probes in aloes for nectar, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> important sources of food.|$|E
5|$|The low {{concentration}} of calcium in the cytosol allows calcium ions {{to function as}} a second messenger in calcium signaling. Here, a signal such as a hormone or an action potential opens calcium channels so that calcium floods into the cytosol. This sudden increase in cytosolic calcium activates other signalling molecules, such as calmodulin and protein kinase C. Other ions such as chloride and potassium may also have signaling functions in the cytosol, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> well understood.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are {{omnivorous}} and forage in {{wetlands and}} saltwater marshes. They tear up {{the ground with}} their powerful beaks in search of bulbs and edible roots. Northern populations mainly eat tubers of the bulkuru sedge (Eleocharis dulcis) which they extract by digging holes in the mud, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> available south of Brisbane. They also eat the shoots and leaves of wetland and upland plants, cereal grains, seeds, insects, mollusks, crustaceans, frogs and lizards. In saltwater marshes they may drink saline water and they have glands near their eyes through which they can excrete excess salt.|$|E

These coins are legal tender throughout the eurozone. Collector coins with various other denominations have been issued as well, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> intended for general circulation, and they are legal tender only in the member state that issued them.|$|E
5|$|Factory-based {{industry}} {{accounted for}} an estimated 29.7% of GDP in 2009. More than 75% of Cameroon's industrial strength is located in Douala and Bonabéri. Cameroon possesses substantial mineral resources, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> extensively mined (see Mining in Cameroon). Petroleum exploitation has fallen since 1986, but {{this is still a}} substantial sector such that dips in prices have a strong effect on the economy. Rapids and waterfalls obstruct the southern rivers, but these sites offer opportunities for hydroelectric development and supply most of Cameroon's energy. The Sanaga River powers the largest hydroelectric station, located at Edéa. The rest of Cameroon's energy comes from oil-powered thermal engines. Much of the country remains without reliable power supplies.|$|E
5|$|In {{its native}} range, the {{sycamore}} {{is associated with}} a biodiverse range of invertebrates and fungi, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> always present in areas to which it has been introduced. It is sometimes planted in urban areas for its value as an amenity tree and produces a hard-wearing, creamy-white close-grained timber that is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, wood flooring and kitchen utensils. It also makes good firewood. The rising sap in spring has been used to extract sugar and make alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, and honey is made by bees collecting the nectar.|$|E

5|$|Many {{crocodilians}} are {{hunted for}} their skins, {{but this is}} not the case with the Cuvier's dwarf caiman. This may be because the ventral skin in this species is too heavily armoured to make it easy to tan. Some individuals are killed by indigenous peoples for food and others, particularly in Guyana, are collected for the pet trade; but there is no evidence that populations are dwindling as a result. There are some threats to this species from habitat destruction, including the mining of gold, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> thought to be of great significance. The estimated total population is over one million individuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the body has no cuticle but consists of a ciliated and glandular epithelium containing rhabdites, which form the mucus in which the cilia glide. Each ciliated cell has many cilia and microvilli. The outermost layer rests on a thickened basement membrane, the dermis. Next to the dermis {{are at least three}} layers of muscles, some circular and some longitudinal. The combinations of muscle types vary between the different classes, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> associated with differences in movement. Nemerteans also have dorso-ventral muscles, which flatten the animals, especially in the larger species. Inside the concentric tubes of these layers is mesenchyme, a kind of connective tissue. In pelagic species this tissue is gelatinous and buoyant.|$|E

However, players can gain access to unique units and improvements by forming an alliance with the tribes by building a trading post at their camps. The native tribes featured are the Aztec, Carib, Cherokee, Comanche, Cree, Inca, Iroquois, Lakota, Maya, Nootka, Seminole, and Tupi. Three of these tribes were made playable in the expansion pack : the Iroquois, Lakota (under the name Sioux) and Aztecs. These civilizations were removed as the smaller, alliance based tribes and were replaced by the Huron, Cheyenne, and Zapotec, respectively. In The Asian Dynasties another three civilizations were added, along with several new native tribes. The civilizations are the Indian, the Japanese, and the Chinese.|$|E

5|$|A later, ground-attack variant, this is {{displayed}} at the Royal Air Force Museum in London; it was captured by British forces at Eggebek, Schleswig-Holstein in May 1945. It {{is thought to have}} been built in 1943–1944 as a D-5 before being rebuilt as a G-2 variant, possibly by fitting G-2 outer wings to a D-5 airframe. The wings have the hard-points for Bordkanone BK 3,7 gun-pods, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> fitted. It was one of 12 captured German aircraft selected by the British for museum preservation and assigned to the Air Historical Branch. The aircraft was stored and displayed at various RAF sites until 1978, when it was moved to the RAF Museum. In 1967, permission was given to use the aircraft in the film Battle of Britain and it was repainted and modified to resemble a 1940 variant of the Ju 87. The engine was found to be in excellent condition and there was little difficulty in starting it, but returning the aircraft to airworthiness was considered too costly for the filmmakers, and ultimately, models were used in the film to represent Stukas. In 1998, the film modifications were removed, and the aircraft returned to the original G-2 configuration.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius sanguifluus, {{commonly}} known as the bloody milk cap, is a species of fungus in the family Russulaceae. First described from France in 1811, the species was given its current name by Elias Fries in 1838 when he transferred it to Lactarius. Found in Asia, Mediterranean Africa, and Europe, fruit bodies (mushrooms) grow scattered or in groups on the ground under conifers, especially Douglas fir. When bruised or cut, the fruit bodies ooze a blood-red to purple latex that slowly turns greenish upon exposure to air. The caps are orangish to reddish-brown, and become funnel-shaped with age. The gills are pinkish to purplish. Different forms have been described from Italy, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> universally accepted as distinct. L.sanguifluus mushrooms are edible, and sold in rural markets of Europe and Asia. Fruit bodies grown in polluted soil, including roadsides subject to heavy traffic, can bioaccumulate toxic heavy metals. Several sterols and pigment have been isolated and identified from the mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestic}} cat {{was first}} classified as Felis catus by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th {{edition of his}} Systema Naturae published in 1758. Because of modern phylogenetics, domestic cats are usually regarded as another subspecies of the wildcat, F. silvestris. This has resulted in mixed usage of the terms, as the domestic cat can be called by its subspecies name, Felis silvestris catus. Wildcats have also {{been referred to as}} various subspecies of F. catus, but in 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature fixed the name for wildcats as F. silvestris. The most common name in use for the domestic cat remains F. catus. Sometimes, the domestic cat has been called Felis domesticus as proposed by German naturalist J.C.P. Erxleben in 1777, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> valid taxonomic names and have been used only rarely in scientific literature. A population of Transcaucasian black feral cats was once classified as Felis daemon (Satunin 1904) but now this population {{is considered to be a}} part of domestic cat.|$|E
