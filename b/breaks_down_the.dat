The youngest of three children in her family, she studied in Ai Tong Primary School and Bendemeer Secondary School, then graduated from Republic Polytechnic as back-up valedictorian and, as of 2012, is studying social science at Singapore Management University.|$|E
5|$|Although {{classified}} as poisonous, reports of human deaths resulting from its ingestion are extremely rare. After parboiling—which weakens its toxicity and <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> mushroom's psychoactive substances—it is eaten {{in parts of}} Europe, Asia, and North America. Amanita muscaria is noted for its hallucinogenic properties, with its main psychoactive constituent being the compound muscimol. The mushroom {{was used as an}} intoxicant and entheogen by the peoples of Siberia, and has a religious significance in these cultures. There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as the Middle East, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.|$|E

5|$|Weather {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} processes that shape the Earth. The process of weathering <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rocks and soils into smaller fragments and then into their constituent substances. During rains precipitation, the water droplets absorb and dissolve carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic, which aids the erosive properties of water. The released sediment and chemicals are then free to take part in chemical reactions that can affect the surface further (such as acid rain), and sodium and chloride ions (salt) deposited in the seas/oceans. The sediment may reform in time and by geological forces into other rocks and soils. In this way, weather {{plays a major role in}} erosion of the surface.|$|E

When she learns the truth about the shagreen and her role in Raphaël's demise, she is horrified. Raphaël cannot control his desire for her and she rushes into an adjoining room to escape him and so save his life. He pounds on the door and declares both his love and his desire to die in her arms. She, meanwhile, is trying to kill herself to free him from his desire. He <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> door, they consummate their love in a fiery moment of passion, and he dies.|$|E
5|$|Desperate, they free Chris, who {{reveals that}} Claire is his sister, and the prison has an armored car {{they can use}} to escape. However, a giant axe-wielding monster begins {{breaking}} down the gate. Alice, Chris and Crystal go to the basement armory to get more guns; however, zombies kill Crystal en route. Luther and Claire reinforce the gate. Angel informs Bennett and Yong the car is missing its engine, {{and it would take}} a week to fix. Bennett shoots Angel and heads for Arcadia in Alice's airplane. The Axeman <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> gate, allowing the zombies into the prison. The group decides to use the zombie-dug tunnels to escape into the sewers. Kim Yong is slashed in half by the Axeman, while Alice is knocked out. Claire successfully defends Alice, manages to defeat the Axeman and disorienting it, after which Alice kills it by firing at its head. Unfortunately, Luther is dragged back into the tunnels by a zombie.|$|E

5|$|Termites are detritivores, {{consuming}} dead {{plants at}} any level of decomposition. They also {{play a vital role}} in the ecosystem by recycling waste material such as dead wood, faeces and plants. Many species eat cellulose, having a specialised midgut that <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> fibre. Termites are considered to be a major source (11%) of atmospheric methane, one of the prime greenhouse gases, produced from the breakdown of cellulose. Termites rely primarily upon symbiotic protozoa (metamonads) and other microbes such as flagellate protists in their guts to digest the cellulose for them, allowing them to absorb the end products for their own use. Gut protozoa, such as Trichonympha, in turn, rely on symbiotic bacteria embedded on their surfaces to produce some of the necessary digestive enzymes. Most higher termites, especially in the family Termitidae, can produce their own cellulase enzymes, but they rely primarily upon the bacteria. The flagellates have been lost in Termitidae. Scientists' understanding of the relationship between the termite digestive tract and the microbial endosymbionts is still rudimentary; what is true in all termite species, however, is that the workers feed the other members of the colony with substances derived from the digestion of plant material, either from the mouth or anus. Judging from closely related bacterial species, it is strongly presumed that the termites' and cockroach's gut microbiota derives from their dictyopteran ancestors.|$|E
5|$|While Shekhar {{is off to}} Darjeeling on a {{business}} trip, Naveen Roy violently thunders at Lalita {{about the loss of}} his hotel project, embarrassing and humiliating her. Roy gets a wall built between his and Gurcharan’s house symbolising the end of their association. Gurcharan, unable to digest this, suffers a heart attack. Upon Shekhar’s return, Roy informs him of the ill-health of his mother and Gurcharan and viciously adds a note of Lalita and Girish’s marriage. Shekhar is disgusted to hear of the marriage and in his anger he scowls at Lalita, humiliating her like his father. Meanwhile, Girish assists Gurcharan's family and takes them to London for the heart treatment. Misunderstandings follow and upon the family’s return from London, Shekhar assumes that Girish and Lalita are married and agrees to marry Gayatri. The film returns to the night of Shekhar’s marriage when Girish hands him the ownership papers of Gurcharan’s haveli. He shocks Shekhar by telling him that he got married to Koel because Lalita denied his marriage proposal. As a conclusion, Shekhar confronts his father and symbolically <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> wall separating the two families. He then brings Lalita to his home as his bride much to the delight of his mother.|$|E

25|$|Casu marzu {{is created}} by leaving whole {{pecorino}} cheeses outside with part of the rind removed to allow the eggs of the cheese fly Piophila casei to be laid in the cheese.

25|$|Phages may be {{released}} via cell lysis, by extrusion, or, {{in a few}} cases, by budding. Lysis, by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called endolysin, which attacks and <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> cell wall peptidoglycan. An altogether different phage type, the filamentous phages, make the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain Mycoplasma phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a lysogenic cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as prophage.|$|E
50|$|For the {{production}} process of enzymatic HVP, enzymes are used to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> proteins. To <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> protein to amino acids, proteases {{are added to the}} mixture of defatted protein and water. Since no salt is formed during {{the production}} process, it is common practice to add salt as an ingredient to meet the criteria as described in the European Code of Practice for Bouillons and Consommés. Due to the sensitivity of enzymes to a specific pH, either an acid or a base is added to match the optimum pH. Depending on the activity of the enzymes it, up to 24 hours are needed to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> proteins. The mixture is heated to inactivate the enzymes and then filtered to remove the insoluble humic acid.|$|R
