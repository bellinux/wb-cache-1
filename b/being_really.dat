He {{attended}} the Pembroke Grammar School, came {{under the influence of}} George Whitefield, probably in the latter's first tour of Wales in 1741, and became one of his preachers. His first station was at Rhyddlangwraig near Narbeth; and in 1747 he made a report of a missionary tour to Bristol, Bath, Gloucestershire, and Birmingham. He broke, however, with Whitefield on doctrinal grounds - his views on the certainty of salvation being regarded as antinomian - and is known to have been in controversy with John Wesley in 1756. In that year, at Carrickfergus, he delivered, in opposition to Wesley, a 'pointless harangue about hirelings and false prophets'. On 2 April 1761 Wesley writes of him and others as 'wretches' who 'call themselves Methodists' <b>being</b> <b>really</b> antinomian.|$|E

[...] "Waiting for the Sun" [...] was written by Fanning as a devotional, gospel style song.

Lawrence stated that it took a considerable length of time to lay on the foundation of Cougar Town; [...] "And once we did and once it was clicking, I think {{that not only did}} Courteney feel comfortable talking to Jen about doing it, but comfortable in how funny she thinks the show is and that Jen would like it and fit into this world really well." [...] He added: [...] "It starts and ends with Courteney and Jennifer <b>being</b> <b>really</b> great friends and excited to work together again—especially doing comedy together.

Seattle [...] "...was a remote and provincial city" [...] in the 1980s; Bruce Pavitt states that the city was [...] "...very working class", a place of [...] "deprivation", and so the scene's [...] "...whole aesthetic – work clothes, thriftstore truckers’ hats, pawnshop guitars" [...] was not just a style, it was done because Seattle [...] "...was very poor."

500|$|At the Paley Festival Glee {{panel in}} March 2010, Murphy stated that Brittany and Santana {{would be seen}} to make out during the show's first season. Morris and Rivera only became aware of this after reading a Paley Festival report online. When they asked Murphy about the development, {{he claimed to have}} made the {{statement}} [...] "to get a kick" [...] out of the [...] "dirty guy" [...] asking about them. Murphy told Morris and Rivera that Glee would not push relationships to appease the show's fans, but would only pursue those which were [...] "organic and natural." [...] While there are moments on the show which depict Brittany and Santana as being very close to one another, Morris attributes these to her close relationship with Rivera: [...] "that is just Naya and I joking around with each other and <b>being</b> <b>really</b> close. It's always her and I just messing around and they end up using it." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{resistance}} to the character, Bungie staff defended the character's introduction. [...] "I'd much rather experiment and do something surprising, and not have everybody appreciate it, than just turn the crank and do another alien war movie with a space marine," [...] said Halo 2 design lead Jaime Griesemer. Community lead Brian Jarrard attributed some of the fan backlash to a discord between the game's marketing and the actual gameplay. [...] "I think, {{even more so than}} playing as the Arbiter, the thing that people were disappointed with and angry about is that they were promised this experience, through the marketing, of <b>being</b> <b>really</b> backs against the wall, Earth's under siege, we're going to do all we can to save our home planet... In reality, the game only had two missions that actually did that." [...] Referring to Halo 2s cliffhanger ending, Griesemer said, [...] "I think if we'd been able to finish that last couple of missions and get you properly back on Earth, a lot of the reaction would have been placated." ...|$|E
500|$|The group's primary musical {{influences}} {{came from}} bands such as Buzzcocks, The Jam, Madness and The Kinks. Supergrass took this contemporary music and mixed it with pop punk's characteristic fast, three-chord, guitar-based, catchy tunes {{to produce a}} sound uniquely their own; [...] "we were just {{the three of us}} in my bedroom or someone's house, just making... we played really hard and just made loads of noise. Most of our early songs were just three chord grooves and stuff that was fun to play. So that's why the first album sounded so 'punky', I think... it's just 'cause we were all used to playing in this small room and it <b>being</b> <b>really</b> loud, so we just made the album sound like that." [...] Songs for Beginners by Graham Nash was another possible influence on I Should Coco. Gaz Coombes told The Guardian in 2003, [...] "We used to listen to it a lot when we lived in Cowley Road in Oxford in 1994, just when the band were getting big." ...|$|E

500|$|Rachel's characterization, {{especially}} her Christmas greed {{even though}} she is Jewish, was singled out for criticism in many reviews. VanDerWerff wrote that the episode [...] " [...] Rachel <b>being</b> <b>really</b> excited about {{what she was going to}} get for Christmas, {{even though she}}'s Jewish", and her end-of episode shout of [...] "Happy Hanukah" [...] a [...] "last minute patch job" [...] to [...] "stay true to the characters as they were at one time". Sullivan also discussed her characterization and noted that she was [...] "a character who makes a point of her Jewish heritage often". He added, [...] "she was basically horrible and played against character the entire episode, so she could eventually realize that she was awful and change her ways." [...] Bell criticized Rachel's list of gifts, such as [...] "spray tan and teeth whitening", as [...] "back to square one" [...] after her nose-job storyline in the second season.

5000|$|Eudaimonia {{depends on}} {{all the things that}} would make us happy if we knew of their existence, but quite {{independently}} of whether we do know about them. Ascribing eudaimonia to a person, then, may include ascribing such things as being virtuous, being loved and having good friends. But these are all objective judgments about someone's life: they concern a person's <b>really</b> <b>being</b> virtuous, <b>really</b> <b>being</b> loved, and <b>really</b> having fine friends. This implies that a person who has evil sons and daughters will not be judged to be eudaimonic even if he or she does not know that they are evil and feels pleased and contented with the way they have turned out (happy). Conversely, being loved by your children would not count towards your happiness if you did not know that they loved you (and perhaps thought that they did not), but it would count towards your eudaimonia. So eudaimonia corresponds to the idea of having an objectively good or desirable life, to some extent independently of whether one knows that certain things exist or not. It includes conscious experiences of well being, success, and failure, but also a whole lot more. (See Aristotle's discussion: Nicomachean Ethics, book 1.10-1.11.) ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} released to minimal press.
