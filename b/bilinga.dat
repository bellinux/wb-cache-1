There was also an allegation that Mr Leigh boarded the Lodestar and only left when chased off by the pilot. This may have been significant to the investigation of the crash if an argument so distracted the pilots that they omitted to properly set the elevator trim prior to take-off. Mr Leigh told the inquest that when he learned Captain Keegan was travelling {{with his wife and two}} children he changed his decision and allowed Captain Keegan to accompany his family. [...] He said he decided to return to Brisbane by train. Another witness also denied there had been an argument between Mr Leigh and the pilot.|$|E
