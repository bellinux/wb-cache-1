For cross-field injection and beam densities much greater than the ambient plasma density, the <b>beam</b> <b>splits</b> into two approximately charge-neutral beams: a H(+) -e(-) beam that propagates down the field lines and a H(+) -H(-) beam that propagates at nearly the initial beam velocity on time scales less than the ion gyroperiod. Because of this splitting, space-charge oscillations are induced in the H(+) -H(-) component, which lead to its breakup. At lower beam densities, particularly when the beam electron density is less than about the density of the ambient plasma, the ambient plasma response reduces the space-charge fields as the <b>beam</b> <b>splits</b> and the space-charge oscillations are suppressed...|$|R

The FOG was first proposed by Vali and Shorthill in 1976.

50|$|For {{interference}} lithography to be successful, coherence requirements must be met. First, a spatially {{coherent light}} source must be used. This is effectively a point light source {{in combination with}} a collimating lens. A laser or synchrotron beam are also often used directly without additional collimation. The spatial coherence guarantees a uniform wavefront prior to <b>beam</b> <b>splitting.</b> Second, it is preferred to use a monochromatic or temporally coherent light source. This is readily achieved with a laser but broadband sources would require a filter. The monochromatic requirement can be lifted if a diffraction grating {{is used as a}} beam splitter, since different wavelengths would diffract into different angles but eventually recombine anyway. Even in this case, spatial coherence and normal incidence would still be required.|$|E
50|$|Axion-like bosons {{could have}} a {{signature}} in astrophysical settings. In particular, several recent works have proposed axion-like particles {{as a solution to}} the apparent transparency of the Universe to TeV photons. It has also been demonstrated in a few recent works that, in the large magnetic fields threading the atmospheres of compact astrophysical objects (e.g., magnetars), photons will convert much more efficiently. This would in turn give rise to distinct absorption-like features in the spectra detectable by current telescopes. A new promising means is looking for quasi-particle refraction in systems with strong magnetic gradients. In particular, the refraction will lead to <b>beam</b> <b>splitting</b> in the radio light curves of highly magnetized pulsars and allow much greater sensitivities than currently achievable. The International Axion Observatory (IAXO) is a proposed fourth generation helioscope.|$|E
