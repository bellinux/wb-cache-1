Creeping discharge or surface discharge is considered as a serious fault condition that can lead to catastrophic failure under normal operating conditions. The studies on this fault condition are normally on the inception and extinction voltage under AC voltages. Recently, there are interest on the white marks formation and leakage current during the surface discharges.
