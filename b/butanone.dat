25|$|Ketones {{have been}} found to act as {{promoters}} for formation of the active cobalt(III) catalyst. In particular, ketones with a-methylene groups oxidize to hydroperoxides that are known to oxidize cobalt(II). Viable ketones were <b>butanone,</b> triacetylmethane (TAM), 2,3-pentanedione (2,3-PD), and acetylacetone; all of which can stabilize radical formation through resonance.|$|E
25|$|Mobil Chemicals in US with above {{processes}} used cobalt catalyst with {{acetic acid}} solvent and <b>butanone</b> as activator. After reaction, crude TPA was leached by adding pure acetic acid and at high temperature to achieve partial solubility.

25|$|The {{haloform}} reaction {{can also}} occur inadvertently in domestic settings. Bleaching with hypochlorite generates halogenated compounds in side reactions; chloroform {{is the main}} byproduct. Sodium hypochlorite solution (chlorine bleach) mixed with common household liquids such as acetone, <b>butanone,</b> methyl ethyl ketone, ethanol, or isopropyl alcohol can produce some chloroform, {{in addition to other}} compounds such as chloroacetone or dichloroacetone.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to sodium chloride and potassium chloride, caesium chloride readily dissolves in concentrated hydrochloric acid. Caesium chloride has also {{a relatively high}} solubility in formic acid (1077 g/L at 18°C) and hydrazine; medium solubility in methanol (31.7 g/L at 25°C) and low solubility in ethanol (7.6 g/L at 25°C), sulfur dioxide (2.95 g/L at 25°C), ammonia (3.8 g/L at 0°C), acetone (0.004% at 18°С), acetonitrile (0.083 g/L at 18°С), ethylacetates and other complex ethers, <b>butanone,</b> acetophenone, pyridine and chlorobenzene.|$|E
500|$|The typical {{reaction}} is conducted at temperatures and pressures {{designed to be}} as hot as possible while still keeping the butane a liquid. Typical reaction conditions are [...] and 55atm. Side-products may also form, including <b>butanone,</b> ethyl acetate, formic acid, and propionic acid. These side-products are also commercially valuable, and the reaction conditions may be altered to produce more of them where needed. However, the separation of acetic acid from these by-products adds {{to the cost of}} the process.|$|E
50|$|Emission of <b>butanone</b> was {{regulated}} in the US as {{a hazardous}} air pollutant, {{because it is}} a volatile organic compound contributing to the formation of tropospheric (ground-level) ozone.

50|$|<b>Butanone</b> {{can react}} with most {{oxidizing}} materials, and can produce fires. It is moderately explosive; it requires {{only a small}} flame or spark to cause a vigorous reaction. <b>Butanone</b> fires should be extinguished with carbon dioxide, dry agents, or alcohol-resistant foam.

5000|$|An {{experiment}} by Turin filmed by the 1995 BBC Horizon documentary [...] "A Code in the Nose" [...] {{consisted of}} mixing the mint isomer with <b>butanone,</b> {{on the theory}} that the shape of the G-protein-coupled receptor prevented the carbonyl group in the mint isomer from being detected by the [...] "biological spectroscope". The experiment succeeded with the trained perfumers used as subjects, who perceived that a mixture of 60% <b>butanone</b> and 40% mint carvone smelled like caraway.|$|E
50|$|<b>Butanone</b> is the {{precursor}} to {{methyl ethyl ketone}} peroxide, which is a catalyst for some polymerization reactions such as crosslinking of unsaturated polyester resins.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Butanone</b> is a {{constituent}} of tobacco smoke. It is an irritant, causing irritation {{to the eyes}} and nose of humans. [...] Serious health effects in animals have been seen only at very high levels. These included skeletal birth defects and low birth weight in mice, when they inhaled it at the highest dose tested (3000 ppm for 7 hours/day). There are no long-term studies with animals breathing or drinking it, and no studies for carcinogenicity in animals breathing or drinking it.There {{is some evidence that}} <b>butanone</b> can potentiate the toxicity of other solvents, in contrast to the calculation of mixed solvent exposures by simple addition of exposures.|$|E
50|$|<b>Butanone</b> is an {{effective}} and common solvent and is used in processes involving gums, resins, cellulose acetate and nitrocellulose coatings and in vinyl films. For this reason it finds use {{in the manufacture of}} plastics, textiles, in the production of paraffin wax, and in household products such as lacquer, varnishes, paint remover, a denaturing agent for denatured alcohol, glues, and as a cleaning agent. It has similar solvent properties to acetone but boils at a higher temperature and has a significantly slower evaporation rate. Unlike acetone, it forms an azeotrope with water, making it useful for azeotropic distillation of moisture in certain applications. <b>Butanone</b> is also used in dry erase markers as the solvent of the erasable dye.|$|E
50|$|Apremilast is a {{phthalimide}} derivative. It is a {{white to}} pale yellow, non-hygroscopic powder that is practically insoluble in water and buffer solutions in a wide pH range, but is soluble in lipophilic solvents such as acetone, acetonitrile, <b>butanone,</b> dichloromethane, and tetrahydrofuran.|$|E
50|$|By contrast, {{substances}} {{are said}} to be immiscible if a significant proportion does not form a solution. Otherwise, the substances are considered miscible. For example, <b>butanone</b> is significantly soluble in water, but these two solvents are not miscible because they are not soluble in all proportions.|$|E
50|$|It is a petrochemical, {{produced}} by the catalytic cracking of crude oil or the dimerization of ethylene.

50|$|Although some 2-butanol {{is used as}} a solvent, it {{is mainly}} {{converted}} to <b>butanone</b> ("MEK"), which is an important industrial solvent and found in many domestic cleaning agents and paint removers. Volatile esters of 2-butanol have pleasant aromas and are used in small amounts as perfumes or in artificial flavors.|$|E

50|$|<b>Butanone,</b> {{also known}} as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), is an organic {{compound}} with the formula CH3C(O)CH2CH3. This colorless liquid ketone has a sharp, sweet odor reminiscent of butterscotch and acetone. It is produced industrially on a large scale, and also occurs in trace amounts in nature. It is soluble in water and is commonly used as an industrial solvent.|$|E

50|$|Drug {{overdose}} {{is often}} caused by combining {{two or more}} depressant drugs, although overdose is certainly possible by consuming a large dose of one depressant drug. CNS depression can also be caused by the accidental or intentional inhalation or ingestion of certain volatile chemicals such as <b>Butanone</b> (contained in Plastic Cement) or Isopropyl Alcohol. Other causes of CNS depression are metabolic disturbances such as hypoglycaemia.|$|E
