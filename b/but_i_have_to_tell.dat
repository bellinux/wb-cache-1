When I was told of the characterization of ‘Kalabhairava’, I had an impression of a young, passionate soldier and naturally it had to have a great body and an authoritative voice.

Before {{beginning}} {{to write the}} life of the blessed Hilarion, I invoke the Holy Spirit which dwelt in him, that, as he largely bestowed virtues on Hilarion, he may give to me speech wherewith to relate them; so that his deeds may be equalled by my language. For those who (as Crispus says) [...] "have wrought virtues" [...] are held to have been worthily praised in proportion to the words in which famous intellects have been able to extol them. Alexander the Great, the Macedonian (whom Daniel calls either the brass, or the leopard, or the he-goat), on coming to the tomb of Achilles, [...] "Happy art thou, youth," [...] he said, [...] "who hast been blest with a great herald of thy worth"--meaning Homer. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the conversation and life of such and so great a man, that even Homer, were he here, would either envy my matter, or succumb under it.|$|E
60|$|But as I stood {{one morning}} on the steps before the hotel, bethinking myself that my throat was as well as ever I remembered it to be, I was {{suddenly}} slapped on the back. Never in my life did I feel a more pleasant sensation, or turn round with more unaffected delight to return a friend's greeting. It was as though {{a cup of water}} had been handed to me in the desert. I knew that a cargo of passengers for Australia had reached Cairo that morning, and were to be passed on to Suez as soon as the railway would take them, and did not therefore expect that the greeting had come from any sojourner in Egypt. I should perhaps have explained that the even tenor of our life at the hotel was disturbed some four times a month by a flight through Cairo of a flock of travellers, who like locusts eat up all that there was eatable at the Inn for the day. They sat down at the same tables with us, never mixing with us, having their separate interests and hopes, and being often, as I thought, somewhat loud and almost selfish in the expression of them. These flocks consisted of passengers passing and repassing by the overland route to and from India and Australia; and had I nothing else to tell, I should delight to describe all that I watched of their habits and manners--the outward bound being so different in their traits from their brethren on their return. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> of my own triumph at Suez, and must therefore hasten on to say that on turning round quickly with my outstretched hand, I found it clasped by John Robinson.|$|E

40|$|Thank you. This is {{the third}} time I’ve spoken in Portland in the past 14 months, and it’s always a {{pleasure}} to be here. <b>But,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, if I come here any more often, I may have to buy Timbers season tickets and climb Mt. Hood. And that’s something I need to think about. Of course, you don’t need to hear about local culture from me. So I’ll segue to my reason for being here today, which is to talk about the U. S. economy and what the Federal Reserve is doing to support the recovery. I’ll start {{with a look at the}} national economy, which continues to make forward progress, despite a number of strong crosscurrents. I’ll then offer my forecasts for growth, unemployment, and inflation. And I’ll wind up by discussing how the Fed is pursuing the goals Congress has set for us of maximum employment and stable prices. In that regard, the question I get asked constantly these days is, when will the Fed begin cutting back on our current program of large-scale purchases of Treasury and mortgage securities? Later in my talk, I’ll lay out for you my perspective on this important question. But, before I do, I should stress that my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.
