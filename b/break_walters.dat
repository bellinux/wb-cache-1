5000|$|Michigan's defense {{played a}} strong game, and its line was {{described}} as [...] "a veritable stone wall." [...] Throughout the game, both teams played a kicking game, punting on second or third down and hoping for a <b>break.</b> <b>Walter</b> Eckersall described {{the pattern of the}} game as follows:Each team would make two attempts to gain. The referee would then charge time out to himself so the centers could wipe off the ball before punting. The ball would be kicked, permitted to hit the ground, and be declared dead by the referee. This was the procedure throughout practically the entire game." ...|$|R

'Toto' Schillaci scored yet again to put Italy ahead in the 17th minute, but Claudio Caniggia equalised midway through the second half, <b>breaking</b> <b>Walter</b> Zenga's clean sheet streak throughout the tournament. There were no more goals in the 90 minutes or in extra time despite Maradona (who played for Naples in Serie A at the time) showing glimpses of magic, {{but there was a}} sending-off: Ricardo Giusti of Argentina was shown the red card in the 13th minute of extra time. Argentina went through on penalties, winning the shoot-out 4-3 after more heroics from Goycochea.|$|R
5000|$|Matt O'Dwyer (born September 1, 1972) is {{a former}} American {{football}} player who played in the National Football League from 1995 to 2005. A 6-foot-4, 315-pound lineman out of Northwestern University, O'Dwyer played for the New York Jets (1995-1998), the Cincinnati Bengals (1999-2003), and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2004). He blocked on lines that produced a 1,000-yard rusher in seven of his 10 NFL seasons (Adrian Murrell 1996-1997, Curtis Martin 1998 and Corey Dillon 1999-2002). He also helped Dillon to <b>break</b> <b>Walter</b> Payton's single-game NFL record, a 278-yard performance vs. Denver, October 22, 2000 (since surpassed by Jamal Lewis in 2003 and Adrian Peterson in 2007).|$|R

2500|$|The Bears {{held the}} Buccaneers to a season-low 92 yards of total offense. Tampa Bay {{repeatedly}} failed to score, despite getting {{the ball with}} good field position. Mike Rae was sacked seven times in his first 11 pass attempts. The Bears controlled the ball for 22:26 of the second half, consistently <b>breaking</b> <b>Walter</b> Payton and Roland Harper for short gains. Payton finished the day with 105 yards rushing and Harper 144, {{the first time the}} Buccaneers had allowed two 100-yard rushers in a single game. It was {{only the second time in}} history that the Bears had two backs each rush for 100 yards. McKay declined to give the Bears much credit, saying that [...] "they had a lot of success running and holding at the same time".|$|R
500|$|The {{scene when}} Walter pleads with Gus {{demonstrates}} the paternal sense of protectiveness Walter has developed for Jesse. During that scene, Walter tells Gus, [...] "You kill me, you have nothing. You kill Jesse, you don't have me." [...] Jesse is visibly {{moved by the}} statement, which Aaron Paul described as [...] "the first moment that Jesse realizes that Walt's loyalty is to Jesse." [...] "Box Cutter" [...] also illustrated Skyler's growing involvement in Walter's illegal activities through the subplot in which she lies to a locksmith to <b>break</b> into <b>Walter's</b> house, {{going so far as}} to use her baby as a prop in her facade. After Skyler <b>breaks</b> into <b>Walter's</b> apartment, she finds the plastic eyeball of a teddy bear that has been part of the series since the second season. The eye has long been used as a symbol to identify Walter's gradual descent into a life of crime, and Skyler's discovery of it symbolizes her own similar descent.|$|R
2500|$|Jesse follows Walter's {{instructions}} and murders Gale. Gus decides to discipline the two by enforcing stricter policies at the lab. He also tries to <b>break</b> <b>Walter</b> and Jesse's friendship by assigning them to separate work details. While Walter {{works in the}} meth lab, Jesse escorts Mike (Jonathan Banks), one of Gus' enforcers, to retrieve payments and provide back-up. Walter and Jesse become increasingly distant from, and hostile to, each other. Meanwhile, Hank, who has been recovering from his last engagement with the cartel, finds evidence linking Gale to Gus. He believes Gus is a major drug distributor and starts looking for tangible evidence to file charges. Gus realizes Walter's close ties with Hank could jeopardize his entire operation. Gus fires Walter and informs him Hank will be killed. He also warns Walter that if he intervenes his entire family will be murdered. Jesse and Walter put their differences aside and agree to murder Gus, convincing former cartel enforcer Hector Salamanca to detonate a suicide bomb; Hector succeeds in this endeavor, killing himself, Gus, and Tyrus, Gus' henchman. Walter and Jesse then destroy the meth lab and Walter declares to his wife, [...] "I won." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Cincinnati Bengals {{selected}} Dillon in {{the second}} round of the 1997 NFL Draft, the 43rd overall pick and the fifth running back. During his first season in 1997, Dillon rushed 39 times for 246 yards and 4 touchdowns in a 41-14 win over the Tennessee Oilers breaking Jim Brown's rookie single game record that had stood for 40 years and remains a Bengals rookie record for carries, yards, and touchdowns, and franchise record for touchdowns. His 1,129 yards that season is also still a Bengals rookie record. For six seasons, Dillon was one of the few bright spots on an otherwise horrible Bengals team. After a 2001 game, Dillon said “we will never win with the Brown family in Cincinnati." [...] From 1997 to 2002, he rushed for over 1,000 yards each year, and made the Pro Bowl 3 times (1999-2001). On October 22, 2000, Dillon set an NFL record for most yards rushed in one game (278 yards) against the Denver Broncos, <b>breaking</b> <b>Walter</b> Payton’s single-game mark of 275 yards set on November 20, 1977. The record has since been broken by Jamal Lewis (295 yards) on September 14, 2003, and Adrian Peterson (296 yards) on November 4, 2007; it remains a franchise record for yards and yards-per-carry (12.64).|$|R

The Fringe team considers <b>breaking</b> into <b>Walter's</b> old lab at Harvard, which has been taken over as an Observer base. Using old service tunnels to avoid detection, they arrive at the lab, finding half of it encased in amber. Walter spots a video camera embedded at {{the epicenter of the}} amber encasement, and suspects that he has recorded the plan on it. They work to assemble a laser to cut out the camera from spare lab parts, but know they will likely need power from the science building.|$|R
50|$|Larry Walters, {{without any}} prior {{ballooning}} experience, attached 42 helium-filled weather balloons to {{a lawn chair}} and lifted off in 1982. In defending against charges later filed against him by the FAA, he stated {{that he intended to}} rise just a few hundred feet (about 100 metres), but underestimated helium's lifting power, causing his tethering strap to <b>break</b> prematurely. <b>Walters</b> quickly rose to nearly 3 mi, over 50 times his intended maximum altitude. Walters reportedly had planned to control his altitude by using a pellet gun to selectively pop some of the balloons. However, he was initially hesitant to shoot any balloons, as he was concerned about falling out due to a loss of stability. Reaching a high altitude and seeing no other way of getting down, he eventually shot several of the balloons, initiating his descent.|$|R
5000|$|Back {{on campus}} after the <b>break,</b> Alison and <b>Walter</b> are {{obviously}} uncomfortable around each other.

As a result, Vernon has a playmate in the holidays and the two start to make a circle of acquaintances. One of them, Nell Vereker, is a thin girl who cannot keep up with Vernon and Joe in their games. The local village is aghast when the property adjoining Abbots Puisannts is bought by a rich Jewish family called the Levinnes and, although held at arm's length at first, gradually the family come {{to be held in}} a grudging acceptance. Vernon and Joe also make friends with the son of the family - Sebastian, who is {{about the same age as}} them. A few weeks before the end of the war, Walter Deyre is killed in action and Vernon inherits Abbots Puisannts, though as he is not of age so it is held in trust for him. A shortage of money means that Myra and her son have to move, and they rent the house out while they move to Birmingham to be near Uncle Sydney.|$|R

50|$|On January 11, 1858, {{at about}} 10:00pm, the Dickson {{homestead}} {{was approached by}} three men, searching for a stray cow. Walter Dickson and his son-in-law, Frederick Steinbeck, informed the men that the cow was not on their property. Within an hour, the men had returned demanding to be let onto the premises, bringing with them an additional 2 men. Walter Dickson fired a warning shot, and retired to bed.
