5|$|Harlan argued to Goebbels that Söderbaum, {{having just}} given birth, {{was too weak}} to take on the role. Goebbels countered that a special room could <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> as a nursery and that a wet-nurse could be hired to care for the infant. He further offered to halt {{shooting}} if Söderbaum became ill. Harlan later reported that Söderbaum was so upset by the entire affair that she considered fleeing back to her native Sweden to avoid having to play the part of Dorothea. In the end, however, she decided to stay and performed the role.|$|E
5|$|In 1574, Queen Elizabeth I {{promoted}} {{the restoration of}} the church, to serve as the grand parish church of Bath. She ordered that a national fund should <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> to finance the work, and in 1583 decreed that it should become the parish church of Bath. James Montague, the Bishop of Bath and Wells from 1608–1616, paid £1,000 for a new nave roof of timber lath construction; according to the inscription on his tomb, this was prompted after seeking shelter in the roofless nave during a thunderstorm.

5|$|In addition, land {{availability}} {{has a large}} {{effect on}} the available solar energy because solar panels can only <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels.

Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Puerto Escondido, they {{continued}} {{up the coast}} to Loreto, where they restocked their supplies. They then visited the Coronado Islands, Concepcíon Bay and San Lucas Cove, collecting specimens at each stop. The work was exhausting; Steinbeck wrote in his letters that he had little time for sleep because the collecting and preparation took so long. In the cramped quarters of the boat, all the equipment had to <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> and stowed each time the boat {{moved to a new}} anchorage, which made the work of cataloguing and processing the specimens doubly arduous.|$|E
5|$|Since {{this was}} to be a {{full-scale}} invasion, it required long-term planning, stock-piling and conscription. It was decided that Xerxes' Pontoon Bridges were to <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> to allow his army to cross the Hellespont to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC). These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any contemporary state. However, the campaign was delayed one year because of another revolt in Egypt and Babylonia.|$|E

5|$|Aerial robots must be {{unmanned}} and autonomous, {{and must}} compete {{based on their}} ability to sense the semi-structured environment of the competition arena. They may be intelligent or preprogrammed, but they must not be controlled by a remote human operator. Computational power need not be carried on the air vehicle itself. Computers operating from standard commercial power may <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> outside the competition arena boundary and uni- or bi-directional data may be transmitted to/from the vehicles in the arena. Size or weight constraints are normally placed on the aerial robots, which must be equipped with a method of manually activated remote override of the primary propulsion system.|$|E

5|$|As {{time went}} on, their props and stage {{equipment}} became increasingly sophisticated. When {{they started to}} fill stadium sized venues and bigger, they ran into {{the problem of the}} audience no longer being able to see them due to the increased seating capacity – this problem was especially clear in their free 2006 concert in Rio de Janeiro on the A Bigger Bang tour, which used over 500 lights, hundreds of speakers, and a video screen almost 13 metres in length. Due to the vast size of the beach which the Stones performed on (2.5km), sound systems had to <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> in a relay pattern {{down the length of the}} beach, in order to keep the sound in sync with music from the stage; for every 340 metres of beach, the sound had to be delayed an additional second.|$|E

Such a legal entity had also been suggested to the authorities previously by local cultural organizations for several years, but they had been largely ignored. On 20 November 2008, fourteen local organizations, including the Tourism Chamber of Pichilemu, the Agrupación Ciudadana por un Pichilemu Limpio (Citizens Group for a Clean Pichilemu), and Canal 3 Pichilemu, {{sent a letter to the}} Pichilemu City Council requesting the creation of the Corporación Cultural de Pichilemu (Pichilemu Cultural Corporation) for the third time.|$|E
5|$|Metro {{awarded a}} $44.1 million {{contract}} {{to a joint}} venture of Atkinson and Dillingham companies to build the tunnel's 3rd Avenue segment as well as Pioneer Square station. Excavation of the station from street level began in March 1987, and the project's twin tunnel boring machines reached James Street from Union Station in September. In June 1987, Atkinson-Dillingham and Metro were fined $80,000 after drilling at the station severed three electric power transmission lines, causing a day-long power outage in downtown Seattle, affecting the City Hall and Public Safety Building. Work in the tunnel station was also blamed for shaking in the City Hall and Public Safety Building, requiring monitoring equipment to <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> by Metro.|$|E

5|$|New Caledonia was {{annexed to}} France in 1853, {{and became an}} {{overseas}} territory of France in 1956. An independence movement led to a failed revolt in 1967, and was restarted in 1984, pursuing total independence status from the French rule. When the 1988 Matignon agreements were signed between the representatives of France and New Caledonia to decide on holding the referendum for independence, Jean-Marie Tjibaou, the Kanak leader of the independence movement, had mooted a proposal {{to set up an}} Agency for the Development of Kanak Culture (ADCK). After Tjibaou's assassination in 1989, the French President François Mitterrand ordered that a cultural centre on the lines suggested by Tjibaou <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> in Nouméa, the capital of New Caledonia; it was to be the last of Mitterrand's Grands Projets. The Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre was formally established in May 1998.|$|E
5|$|The 400-page report made 108 {{recommendations}} in child protection reform. Regional and local committees {{for children and}} families are to <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>up,</b> with members from all groups involved in child protection. Previously each local authority managed their own child protection register, a list of children believed to be at risk, and no national register existed; this, combined with local authorities' tendency to suppress information about child abuse cases, led to the implementation of the child database. Two organisations to improve the care of children, the General Social Care Council and the Social Care Institute for Excellence, had already been set up by the time the report was published.|$|E
