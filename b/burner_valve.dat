50|$|Snap action {{thermostats}} are {{the most}} common control used in heavy duty commercial griddles with medium-to-heavy production demands. These controls are called “snap action” because the control mechanism will turn the <b>burner</b> <b>valve</b> or electrical element fully on or completely off, with no modulation or intermediate heat source operation - effectively ‘snapping’ the heat source on or off. While not as responsive as solid state controls, snap action controls can maintain a griddle surface temperature within +/- 15°F (8°C) of set point if the thermostat bulb is embedded assuming a 1-inch (25mm) thick steel plate. This operating temperature range may be pushed to +/- 20 to 25°F (10°C to 13°C) if the probe is bottom mounted due to the additional thermal hysteresis introduced by the plate material.|$|E
50|$|With {{the pilot}} still burning, the main <b>burner</b> <b>valves</b> are {{opened and the}} main flame is lit. The flame {{detection}} device here will also shut-down or close all the fuel valves if the flame is extinguished.|$|R
50|$|Many {{gas grill}} {{components}} {{can be replaced}} with new parts, adding to the useful life of the grill. Though charcoal grills can sometimes require new cooking grids and charcoal grates, gas grills are much more complex, and require additional components such as <b>burners,</b> <b>valves,</b> and heat shields.|$|R
50|$|Commercial griddles {{are often}} {{required}} to have pilot protection (also known as “flame safety”) to prevent the unregulated flow of gas if the griddle pilot burners are somehow extinguished. This protection system can be electro-mechanical in nature, electrical, or electronic. All of these systems detect {{the presence of a}} pilot flame through a proximity sensor, which then allows or disallows gas flow to the <b>burner</b> <b>valves</b> based on the signal. Valves cannot then allow gas to flow to the burners if there is no pilot burner to ignite the gas, mitigating a safety hazard.|$|R
5000|$|Stoves {{feature a}} neoprene-insulated pot (billycan), {{corrugated}} metal heat exchanger (burner) and <b>burner</b> adjustment <b>valve</b> [...] - [...] with ignition via either an outside source or integral push-button electric igniter, {{depending on the}} model.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of <b>burners,</b> high {{temperature}} <b>valves</b> and gas ducts, oxides of CMCs are used. Components of slide bearings for providing corrosion resistance and wear resistance.|$|R
50|$|The {{design was}} based on the HeS 30 not only to make parts more readily {{available}} as well as to make direct comparisons between the two easier. The main changes were to reduce the compression ratio of the compressor to about 2:1 (from 2.8:1), and add the new combustion chambers. The new chambers were considerably larger than the originals, forcing a reduction in the number from ten to six <b>burners.</b> The <b>valve</b> stems projected forward into streamlined fairings in the intake area behind the compressor.|$|R
50|$|Valves {{can wear}} out or become rusted and too {{difficult}} to operate requiring replacement. A valve is unlike a <b>burner,</b> a replacement <b>valve</b> usually must be an exact match to the original in order to fit properly. As a consequence, many grills are disposed of when valves fail {{due to a lack}} of available replacements.|$|R

The air inlet on this particular model is adjusted by rotating the barrel, thus opening or closing the vertical baffles at the base.|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to estimate the test section noise levels and the outside noise radiation patterns of blowdown wind tunnels. Included are considerations of noise generation by control <b>valves,</b> <b>burners,</b> turbulent boundary layers, and exhaust jets as appropriate. Sample test section and radiation field noise estimates are presented. The external estimates are noted to be in good agreement with the limited amount of available measurements...|$|R
50|$|The {{direction}} of flight {{depends on the}} wind, but the altitude of the balloon can be controlled by changing {{the temperature of the}} air inside the envelope. The pilot may open one or more <b>burner</b> blast <b>valves</b> to increase the temperature inside the envelope, thereby increasing lift, and thus ascend or slow or stop a descent. The pilot may also open a vent, if the envelope is so equipped, to let hot air escape, decreasing the temperature inside the envelope, thereby decreasing lift, and thus descend or slow or stop an ascent. Unless the pilot intervenes, the air inside the envelope will slowly cool, by seepage or by contact with cooler outside air, and slowly provide less lift.|$|R
40|$|Noise {{tests of}} NASA Lewis Research Center's Powered Lift Facility (PLF) were {{performed}} to determine the frequency content of the internally generated noise that reaches the far field. The sources of the internally generated noise are the <b>burner,</b> elbows, <b>valves,</b> and flow turbulence. Tests over a range of nozzle pressure ratios from 1. 2 to 3. 5 using coherence analysis revealed that low frequency noise below 1200 Hz is transmitted through the nozzle. Broad banded peaks at 240 and 640 Hz {{were found in the}} transmitted noise. Aeroacoustic excitation effects are possible in this frequency range. The internal noise creates a noise floor that limits the amount of jet noise suppression that can be measured on the PLF and similar facilities...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the tricks}} {{involved}} in flying a balloon {{is learning to}} deal with the delayed response. To slow or stop a descent requires the pilot to open a <b>burner</b> blast <b>valve.</b> This sends hot combustion exhaust through the mouth into the envelope where it expands and forces some cooler air out of the mouth. This lightens the total weight of the system and increases its buoyancy, but not immediately. From the time that the burner is lit until the balloon slows or stops its descent can take 30 seconds or more, depending on its rate of descent, how cold it has become, and how powerful the burner. This delay requires a great deal of anticipation {{on the part of the}} pilot.|$|R
50|$|The gas {{industry}} market structure was dramatically altered {{by the discovery}} of massive natural gas fields throughout the American Southwest beginning in 1918. The fuel was cleaner than manufactured gas and less expensive to produce. While natural gas sources were abundant in Southern California, no economical sources were available in Northern California. In 1929, PG&E constructed a 300-mile pipeline from the Kettleman oil field to bring natural gas to San Francisco. The city became the first major urban area to switch from manufactured gas to natural gas. The transition required the adjustment of <b>burners</b> and airflow <b>valves</b> on 1.75 million appliances. In 1936, PG&E expanded distribution with an additional 45-mile pipeline from Milpitas. PG&E gradually retired its gas manufacturing facilities, although some plants were kept on standby.|$|R

25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both {{open and close}} the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main <b>burner</b> gas supply <b>valve</b> should that not happen.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this DOE sponsored project was to successfully fire coal-water slurry in a fire-tube boiler that was designed for oil/gas firing and establish a data base that will be relevant to {{a large number of}} existing installations. Firing slurry in a fire-tube configuration is a very demanding application because of the extremely high heat release rates and the correspondingly low furnace volume where combustion can be completed. Recognizing that combustion efficiency is the major obstacle when firing slurry in a fire-tube boiler, the program was focused on innovative approaches for improving carbon burnout without major modifications to the boiler. The boiler system was successfully designed and operated to fire coal-water slurry for extended periods of time with few slurry related operational problems. The host facility was a 3. 8 million Btu/hr Cleaver-Brooks fire-tube boiler located on the University of Alabama Campus. A slurry atomizer was designed that provided outstanding atomization and was not susceptible to pluggage. The boiler was operated for over 1000 hours and 12 shipments of slurry were delivered. The new equipment engineered for the coal-water slurry system consisted of the following: combustion air and slurry heaters; cyclone; baghouse; fly ash reinjection system; new control system; air compressor; CWS/gas <b>burner</b> and gas <b>valve</b> train; and storage tank and slurry handling system...|$|R
40|$|When an {{acoustic}} wave {{is present in}} a solid propellant combustion environment, the mass flux from the combustion zone oscillates at the same frequency as the acoustics. The acoustic wave is either amplified or attenuated by {{the response of the}} combustion to the acoustic disturbance. When the acoustic wave is amplified, this process is called combustion instability. The amplification is quantitatively measured by a response function. The ability to predict combustion stability for a solid propellant formulation is essential to the formulator to prevent or minimize the effects of instabilities, such as an oscillatory thrust. Unfortunately, the prediction of response values for a particular propellant remains a technical challenge. Most predictions of the response of propellants are based on test data, but {{there are a number of}} questions about the reliability of the standard test method, the T-burner. Alternate methods have been developed to measure the response of a propellant, including the ultrasound burner, the magnetic flowmeter and the rotating <b>valve</b> <b>burner,</b> but there are still inconsistencies between the results obtained by these different methods. Aside from the experimental differences, the values of the pressure-coupled responses obtained by different researchers are often compared erroneously, for the simple reason that inconsistencies in the definitions of the responses and admittances are not considered. The use of different definitions has led to substantial confusion since the first theoretical treatments of the problem by Hart and McClure in 1959. The definitions and relations derived here seek to alleviate this problem...|$|R
