40|$|In {{this paper}} we perform a {{mathematical}} analyse of {{profits and losses}} in direct and full costing. They are compared in different situations, mainly the utilisation of productive capacity {{and the existence of}} <b>beginning</b> <b>inventories.</b> Direct costing was conceived as a system of cost accounting which would show profits as a function of sales. In full costing profits depend on available combinations of sales, production, costs of <b>beginning</b> <b>inventories,</b> etc., and information displayed in financial statements display appears incongruent. Differences in profits with full and direct costing increase when full costing allocates fixed costs according to normal production, in some cases differences, and financial statements would show more incongruent performance. It is concluded about the importance that profit and loss statement expresses profits in both costing systems.

50|$|From a {{financial}} accounting perspective, backflushing {{is a technique}} of the perpetual inventory system. Small businesses which have a rather modest variety of items in their inventory still use periodic inventory management. A periodic inventory system does not require day-to-day tracking of physical inventory. Purchases, cost of goods sold, and inventory on hand cannot be tracked {{until the end of}} the accounting time period when a physical inventory is performed and ending inventory is compared against the sum of <b>beginning</b> <b>inventory</b> and purchases. Cost of ending inventory can be calculated by using the LIFO or FIFO inventory accounting methods, or other less common methods. The end of the accounting period is considered usually the end of each month because otherwise some taxes like the VAT (value added tax) cannot be charged. The monthly stock-taking is the main disadvantage of the periodic inventory system. Another disadvantage is that it requires also monthly a reconciliation between the records of the management accounting and the financial accounting.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{structure}} of the optimal ordering policies for several inventory models with multiple order opportunities. The inventory models that are examined in this thesis are: (1) the newsvendor model with a second order opportunity; (2) the stochastic multi-period inventory model with limited order opportunities; and (3) the stochastic multi-period inventory model with two supply modes. ^ For (1), we develop three models (Models I, II, and III) that differ in the timing of the second order. In all three models, the first order is placed for delivery {{at the beginning of the}} season. In Model I, the second order quantity is determined at the beginning of the season for delivery at a pre-specified time. In Model II, the second order quantity is determined at some pre-specified time that can be any where during the season. In Model III, both the timing and quantity of the second order are determined dynamically. ^ For Model III, we establish for the first time that under appropriate conditions, the decision to place a second order is characterized by a time-dependent (s,S) policy. A counterexample is presented that suggests that the policy structure under more general conditions would likely be more complex. Model II is a generalization of the model of Fisher et al. (2001). We show that under mild regularity conditions, this problem has sufficient structure to reduce to a sequential search of two programs, each of which has at most one local minimum. For Model I, we establish robust conditions under which the optimization behaves well. ^ For (2), we examine a model under the assumptions that shortages are backordered, demand density functions fall in PF 2 family and unit purchase cost is non-decreasing as we get closer to the end of the problem horizon. We show that a time varying (s,S) policy is the optimal decision rule for this model. ^ For (3), the two supply modes differ in their delivery leadtimes. The chapter contributes by showing that there are unique 2 ̆ 2 order up to 2 ̆ 2 levels to determine the order quantities from these two suppliers. We identify conditions when it is optimal to order from just one supplier or from both. In case it is optimal to order from both in a period, we show that at the beginning of the period, if the <b>beginning</b> <b>inventory</b> level is between a certain pair of points, then it is optimal to raise the inventory position to the higher point through a slow order. However, if the <b>beginning</b> <b>inventory</b> position is lower than the lower point, then the inventory level is first raised up to this point through a fast order and then the inventory position is raised up to the higher point through a slow order. If the <b>beginning</b> <b>inventory</b> is higher than the higher point, no order needs to be placed. The optimal policies in this chapter are supported by the property that the cost is unimodal in the <b>beginning</b> <b>inventory</b> position and convex in the <b>beginning</b> <b>inventory</b> level. We need the PF 2 density assumption to prove this property. ...|$|E
