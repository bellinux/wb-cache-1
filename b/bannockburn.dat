5|$|Lincolnshire lies {{on three}} {{arterial}} roads: Illinois Route 22, {{which is known}} as Half Day Road in this area; Milwaukee Avenue, which appears as Illinois Route 21/U.S. Route 45; and Aptakisic Road, which meets Milwaukee in the southern region of Lincolnshire. Lincolnshire shares its eastern border with the village of <b>Bannockburn</b> at Interstate 94 (where it is {{a portion of the}} Tri-State Tollway). Route 22 crosses the Des Plaines River before bridging <b>Bannockburn</b> and Lincolnshire by arching over Interstate Highway 94.|$|E
5|$|Balfours {{had fought}} with Robert the Bruce at the Battle of <b>Bannockburn</b> in 1314, and a {{pedigree}} written {{under the authority}} of the Lord Lyon King of Arms traced James Balfour's descent in a direct line from King Robert II, son-in-law of Robert the Bruce.|$|E
5|$|There was {{one final}} {{widening}} project that was worked on in 2005, this time located mostly in <b>Bannockburn.</b> East of Illinois 43 {{for about a}} half mile, Illinois 22 was widened to four lanes while in the process a nearby bridge was replaced.|$|E
5|$|Lincolnshire {{is located}} at 42°11′47″ North and 87°55′2″ West, and shares a border with the villages of Vernon Hills to the northwest, Buffalo Grove to the southwest, <b>Bannockburn</b> to the east, and Riverwoods to the southeast. The city of Lake Forest is located to the {{northeast}} of the village, while the unincorporated community of Prairie View borders the village directly to the west.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years Pembroke {{worked closely with the}} King. He was appointed the King’s lieutenant in Scotland in 1314, and was present at the disastrous English defeat at the Battle of <b>Bannockburn,</b> where he helped lead Edward away from the field of battle. In 1317, however, while returning from a papal embassy to Avignon, he was captured by a Jean de Lamouilly, and held for ransom in Germany. The ransom of £10,400 was to cause Pembroke significant financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.|$|E
5|$|Robert died {{fighting}} the Scots {{at the battle}} of <b>Bannockburn</b> and the region around the castle was attacked in 1314 and 1319, causing significant damage to neighbouring Church Brough. Around this time the village of Market Brough was established along the road overlooked by the castle, in an attempt by the Cliffords to maximise the possibilities for profits from trade along the valley. Market Brough acquired a royal charter in 1330 and seems to have rapidly overtaken Church Brough as the main settlement in the area.|$|E
5|$|When Gaveston {{returned}} to England in 1312contrary to the rulings of the Ordinanceshe {{was taken into}} custody by Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke. Warwick abducted Gaveston and, together with Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, had him executed. The act garnered sympathy and support for the king, but Warwick and Lancaster nevertheless managed to negotiate a royal pardon for their actions. After the disastrous defeat at the Battle of <b>Bannockburn</b> in 1314, King Edward's authority was once more weakened, and the rebellious barons took over control of government. For Warwick the triumph was brief; he died the next year.|$|E
5|$|After the fiasco of <b>Bannockburn,</b> the earls of Lancaster and Warwick {{saw their}} {{political}} influence increase, and they pressured Edward to re-implement the Ordinances of 1311. Lancaster became {{the head of}} the royal council in 1316, promising to take forward the Ordinances through a new reform commission, but he appears to have abandoned this role soon afterwards, partially because of disagreements with the other barons, and possibly because of ill-health. Lancaster refused to meet with Edward in parliament for the next two years, bringing effective governance to a standstill. This stymied any hopes for a fresh campaign into Scotland and raised fears of civil war. After much negotiation, once again involving the Earl of Pembroke, Edward and Lancaster finally agreed to the Treaty of Leake in August 1318, which pardoned Lancaster and his faction and established a new royal council, temporarily averting conflict.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the end of}} the year, Gaveston had {{returned}} to England, and civil war appeared imminent. In May 1312, Gaveston was taken captive by the Earl of Pembroke, but Warwick and Lancaster had him abducted and executed after a mock trial. This affront to Pembroke’s honour drove him irrevocably into the camp of the king, and thereby split the opposition. The brutality of the act initially drove Lancaster and his adherents away from the centre of power, but the Battle of <b>Bannockburn,</b> in June 1314, returned the initiative. Edward was humiliated by his disastrous defeat, while Lancaster and Warwick had not taken part in the campaign, claiming that it was carried out without the consent of the baronage, and as such in defiance of the Ordinances.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 14th century, before the {{outbreak}} of the Black Death, the town of Clare had a population of around 600. The de Clares continued to own estates across England, but in Suffolk their possessions were concentrated in estates clustered around Clare Castle. The castle was passed through the de Clare line until Gilbert de Clare died at the battle of <b>Bannockburn</b> in 1314, when the estate passed onto his sisters. Elizabeth de Clare, whose husband John de Burgh had died the previous year, acquired the castle; the combined estates made Elizabeth one of the wealthiest women in England. Elizabeth used the castle as her main residence between 1322 and 1360.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the fourteenth century, in {{addition}} to forces raised on the basis of common service and feudal obligations, money contracts of bonds or bands of manrent, similar to English indentures of the same period, were being used to retain more professional troops, particular men-at-arms and archers. In practice, forms of service tended to blur and overlap, and several major Scottish lords brought contingents from their kindred. These systems produced relatively large numbers of poorly armoured infantry, usually armed with 12–14 foot spears. They often formed the large close order defensive formations of shiltrons, able to counter mounted knights as they did at <b>Bannockburn,</b> or infantry assault as at Otterburn in 1388, but vulnerable to arrows (and later artillery fire) and relatively immobile, as they proved at Halidon Hill in 1333 and Humbleton Hill in 1402.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's son, {{also called}} Gilbert de Clare, {{inherited}} the castle, but he died fighting {{at the battle}} of <b>Bannockburn</b> in 1314 while still quite young. The family's lands were initially placed {{under the control of the}} Crown, but before any decision could be taken on the inheritance, a revolt broke out in Glamorgan. Anger over the actions of the royal administrators caused Llywelyn Bren to rise up in January 1316, attacking Caerphilly Castle with a large force of men. The castle withstood the attack, but the town was destroyed and the rebellion spread. A royal army was despatched to deal with the situation, defeating Bren in a battle at Caerphilly Mountain and breaking the Welsh siege of the castle.|$|E
5|$|Goronwy ap Tudur Hen (died 1331), {{also known}} as Goronwy ap Tudur or Goronwy Fychan, was a Welsh aristocrat and Lord of Penmynydd. He {{was a member of}} the Tudor family of Penmynydd, Anglesey, North Wales, and a direct {{ancestor}} of Owen Tudor and thereby the Royal House of Tudor. He was a soldier for the English crown, who fought in the First War of Scottish Independence, including in the English invasion which led to the Battle of <b>Bannockburn.</b> He remained loyal to King Edward II of England until the king's death, and was both a yeoman and forester of Snowdon. After his death in 1331, his body was interned in Llanfaes Friary, near Bangor, Gwynedd.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Robert the Bruce {{exploited}} {{his victory}} at <b>Bannockburn</b> to raid northern England, initially attacking Carlisle and Berwick, and then reaching further south into Lancashire and Yorkshire, even threatening York itself. Edward undertook an expensive but unsuccessful campaign {{to stem the}} advance in 1319, but the famine made {{it increasingly difficult to}} keep his garrisons supplied with food. Meanwhile, a Scottish expedition led by Robert's brother successfully invaded Ireland in 1315, where Edward Bruce declared himself the King of Ireland. He was finally defeated in 1318 by Edward II's Irish justiciar, Edmund Butler, at the Battle of Faughart, and Edward Bruce's severed head was sent back to the King. Revolts also broke out in Lancashire and Bristol in 1315, and in Glamorgan in Wales in 1316, but were suppressed.|$|E
5|$|On 14 October 1322, the English {{army was}} routed by the Scots, {{under the command}} of Robert the Bruce, at the Battle of Old Byland in Yorkshire. The English commander, John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond, was taken prisoner, while the king himself barely escaped capture. It was the worst defeat the English had {{suffered}} in the wars since the Battle of <b>Bannockburn</b> in 1314. Harclay had received a summons to join the royal army, but {{had not been able to}} bring his troops south in time to come to the king's rescue. The event convinced him that the war against Scotland could not be won under the leadership of the present king. Instead he entered into direct negotiations with the Scots, without the king's sanction. On 3 January 1323, he signed a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce at Lochmaben.|$|E
5|$|The English {{enjoyed a}} marked superiority over the Scots in cavalry, {{particularly}} with the resurgence of heavy cavalry with their use of demi-lancers. The feudal heavy cavalry had begun to disappear from Scottish armies after <b>Bannockburn</b> in 1314. It was limited by the shortage of suitable horses. James V imported great horses and mares from Denmark {{in an attempt to}} improve the quality of Scottish breading stock. In the mid-sixteenth century the Scots still lacked sufficient heavy cavalry. In their place they fielded relatively large numbers of light horse, often drawn from the Borders and usually wearing jacks of leather or mail, mounted on small horses and using light lances. As firearms became available they began to field relatively large numbers of mounted arquebusiers.|$|E
5|$|The Ordainers {{once more}} sent Gaveston into exile in 1311, but by 1312 he was back. Now the king's {{favourite}} was officially an outlaw, and Arundel {{was among the}} earls who swore to hunt him down. The leader of the oppositionafter Lincoln's death the year beforewas now Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. In June 1312 Gaveston was captured, tried before Lancaster, Arundel and the earls of Warwick and Hereford, and executed. A reconciliation was achieved between the king and the offending magnates, and Arundel and the others received pardons, but animosity prevailed. In 1314 Arundel was among the magnates who refused to assist Edward in a campaign against the Scots, contributing to the disastrous English defeat at the Battle of <b>Bannockburn.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although ostracised {{because of}} the murder of Gaveston, Thomas of Lancaster had regained virtual control of royal {{government}} in the period after England's defeat at <b>Bannockburn.</b> Proving himself as incapable to rule as Edward, however, he soon grew unpopular. Pembroke was one of the magnates who in the years 1316-18 tried to prevent civil war from breaking out between the supporters of Edward and those of Lancaster, and he helped negotiate the Treaty of Leake in 1318, restoring Edward to power. Peace did not last long, however, as the King by now had taken on Hugh Despenser the younger as another favourite, in much the same position as Gaveston. Pembroke's attempts at reconciliation eventually failed, and civil war broke out in 1321. In 1322 Lancaster was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and executed. Pembroke was among the Earls behind the conviction. Also in 1322, Pembroke founded a leper hospital in Gravesend.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of <b>Bannockburn,</b> however, Arundel's loyalty began to shift back towards the king. Edward's {{rapprochement}} towards the earl had in fact started earlier, when on 2 November 1313, the king pardoned Arundel's royal debts. The most significant factor in this process though, was the marriage alliance between Arundel and the king's new favourites, the Despensers. Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father Hugh Despenser the elder were gradually taking {{over control of the}} government, and using their power to enrich themselves. While this alienated most of the nobility, Arundel's situation was different. At some point in 1314–1315, his son Richard was betrothed to Isabel, daughter of Hugh Despenser the Younger. Now that he found himself back in royal favour, Arundel started receiving rewards in the form of official appointments. In 1317 he was appointed Warden of the Marches of Scotland, and in August 1318, he helped negotiate the Treaty of Leake, which temporarily reconciled the king with Thomas of Lancaster.|$|E
5|$|Earl Thomas, {{with other}} barons, {{captured}} King Edward's favourite, Piers Gaveston, {{and killed him}} in 1312. Nevertheless, the King stayed at Melbourne in 1314. For a time, after Edward's defeat at <b>Bannockburn,</b> the earl, {{a friend of the}} Scots, controlled most of England, but by 1321 Edward had raised an army and driven Thomas from the Midlands. The Lancastrian castles at Melbourne and Tutbury were left deserted and looted by the local populace. Earl Thomas was finally defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322. He was swiftly executed, and Robert de Holland was beheaded in 1328. The King sent a garrison to Melbourne and appointed a steward, Ralph Basset, to replace the incumbent, John de Hardedeshull. In March, those who had stolen from the castle were arrested, and by April Edward had withdrawn his troops. He appointed Robert Tocher and Roger de Beler in 1323 to help administer his possessions in Melbourne using money obtained from confiscations of rebel property in Staffordshire. Edward stayed at Melbourne again in 1325, and while there he issued a right to collect tolls to the men of nearby Swarkestone to repair the bridge over the Trent.|$|E
5|$|Edward had a {{close and}} {{controversial}} relationship with Piers Gaveston, who had joined his household in 1300. The precise nature of Edward and Gaveston's relationship is uncertain; {{they may have been}} friends, lovers or sworn brothers. Gaveston's arrogance and power as Edward's favourite provoked discontent both among the barons and the French royal family, and Edward was forced to exile him. On Gaveston's return, the barons pressured the King into agreeing to wide-ranging reforms called the Ordinances of 1311. The newly empowered barons banished Gaveston, to which Edward responded by revoking the reforms and recalling his favourite. Led by Edward's cousin, the Earl of Lancaster, a group of the barons seized and executed Gaveston in 1312, beginning several years of armed confrontation. English forces were pushed back in Scotland, where Edward was decisively defeated by Robert the Bruce at the Battle of <b>Bannockburn</b> in 1314. Widespread famine followed, and criticism of the King's reign mounted.|$|E
5|$|English naval {{power was}} vital to Edward I's {{successful}} campaigns in Scotland from 1296, using largely merchant ships from England, Ireland {{and his allies}} in the Islands to transport and supply his armies. Part {{of the reason for}} Robert I's success was his ability to call on naval forces from the Islands. As a result of the expulsion of the Flemings from England in 1303, he gained the support of a major naval power in the North Sea. The development of naval power allowed Robert to successfully defeat English attempts to capture him in the Highlands and Islands and to blockade major English controlled fortresses at Perth and Stirling, the last forcing Edward II to attempt the relief that resulted at English defeat at <b>Bannockburn</b> in 1314. Scottish naval forces allowed invasions of the Isle of Man in 1313 and 1317 and Ireland in 1315. They were also crucial in the blockade of Berwick, which led to its fall in 1318.|$|E
5|$|Goronwy ap Tudur Hen was Lord of Penmynydd and {{a soldier}} {{in the service of the}} English crown. He joined King Edward II of England for his {{invasion}} of Scotland in 1314 as part of the First War of Scottish Independence, which included service at the Battle of <b>Bannockburn</b> in June of that year. In 1316, a rebellion took place in Glamorgan under the leadership of Llywelyn Bren, at the same time Edward was campaigning in Scotland. Despite this there was little concern that it would spread to North Wales, with the royal officials instead concerned with the threat of invasion from Ireland. Some 1,500 troops were summoned from the area to support the King, and among those leading those troops were Iorweth ap Gruffudd, Gruffudd Llwyd and his cousin Goronwy ap Tudur Hen. After these troops, under the command of Gruffudd Llwyd, moved to Chester, they were dismissed on 4 August 1316 to return to North Wales in order to protect the area from the Irish threat.|$|E
5|$|Locating the armillary {{building}} in Egypt {{with the three}} stone keys, George and Nico sneak into the building, only to see Susarro forcing Bruno to activate the armillary. As it powers up, George and Nico subdue Susarro, just before Petra arrives with a hooded man seen twice before during their adventure, who proceeds to kill Susarro with supernatural powers. The figure {{turns out to be}} the Grand Master of the Neo-Templars, thought to have been killed back in <b>Bannockburn,</b> but had survived, having Petra work with Susarro until he learnt what the Grand Master needed. With the armillary active and the location of a large power site displayed, the Grand Master sets off dynamite in the building as he escapes with Petra, trapping George, Nico, and Bruno inside and killing Flap. The group find the only way for them to escape is for one of them to sacrifice themselves in one of the puzzle rooms, forcing Bruno to take the responsibility, hoping to atone for past sins so that George and Nico can stop the Grand Master.|$|E
5|$|Now one of Edward's strongest supporters, he {{accompanied}} the king {{on a campaign}} to Scotland in 1314, when several other nobles refused. He was killed at the Battle of <b>Bannockburn</b> on 24June, under somewhat unclear circumstances. Gloucester was {{the most prominent of}} the casualties of the battle, which ended in a humiliating defeat for England. As he had no issue, his death marked the end of the prominent de Clare family. His estates were divided between his three sisters, one of whom was married to the king's new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger. Despenser's ruthless expansion of the de Clare lordship of Glamorgan in Wales led directly to the troubles of EdwardII's later reign, including a rebellion in the Welsh Marches, the defeat of the Earl of Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and eventually the deposition of the king by Roger Mortimer and Queen Isabella in 1326.|$|E
5|$|Redback spiders {{are also}} found in small colonies in areas of New Zealand. They are {{frequently}} intercepted by quarantine authorities, often among steel or car shipments. They were introduced into New Zealand in the early 1980s and now are found around Central Otago (including Alexandra, <b>Bannockburn</b> and near Wanaka) in the South Island and New Plymouth in the North Island. Authorities in the United Arab Emirates warn residents and visitors of redback spiders, which have been present since 1990. Colonies have also been established in greenhouses in Belgium, and isolated observations indicate possible presence in New Guinea, the Philippines, and India. Some redbacks were found in Preston, Lancashire, England, after a container of parts arrived from Australia; some may have escaped into the countryside before pest controllers could destroy them. One redback {{was found in a}} back garden in Dartford in Kent. Two females were discovered in the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Richard's grandson, Gilbert de Clare, {{the last}} male de Clare, {{died at the}} battle of <b>Bannockburn</b> in 1314 and the castle was given to Hugh Despenser the Younger, the {{controversial}} favourite of Edward II. Poor harvests and harsh governance by the Despenser family encouraged a Welsh rebellion under Llywelyn Bren in 1316; this was crushed and Llywelyn was hanged, drawn and quartered in Cardiff Castle in 1318 on Hugh's orders. The execution attracted much criticism from across both the English and Welsh communities, and in 1321 Hugh arrested Sir William Fleminge as a scapegoat for the incident, first detaining him in the Black Tower and then executing him in the castle grounds. Conflict between the Despensers and the other Marcher Lords broke out soon after, leading to the castle being sacked in 1321 during the Despenser War. The Despensers recovered the castle and retained {{it for the rest of}} the century, despite the execution of Hugh Despenser for treason in 1326. Under a 1340 charter granted by the Despensers, the castle's constable was made the de facto mayor of Cardiff, controlling the local courts.|$|E
5|$|Rivals John Comyn and Robert the Bruce, {{grandson}} of the claimant Robert Bruce of Annandale, were appointed as joint guardians in Wallace's place. On 10 February 1306, Bruce {{participated in the}} murder of Comyn, at Greyfriars Kirk in Dumfries. Less than seven weeks later, on 25 March Bruce was crowned as king Robert I at Scone. However, Edward's forces overran the country after defeating Bruce's small army at the Battle of Methven. Despite the excommunication of Bruce and his followers by Pope Clement V, his support grew; and by 1314, with the help of leading nobles such as Sir James Douglas and the Earl of Moray, only the castles at Bothwell and Stirling remained under English control. Edward I had died in 1307 and his heir Edward II moved an army north to break the siege of Stirling Castle and reassert control. They were defeated by forces under Robert I at the Battle of <b>Bannockburn</b> in 1314, securing de facto independence.|$|E
5|$|The {{brutality}} and questionable {{legality of the}} earls' actions helped win political sympathy for the king. Pembroke was particularly offended, {{as he had been}} made to break his promise of safety to Gaveston, and his chivalric honour had been damaged. From this point on Pembroke sided firmly with King Edward in the political conflict. The king himself swore vengeance on his enemies, but found himself unable to move against them immediately, partly because they were in possession of a number of highly valuable royal jewels taken from Gaveston. A settlement was reached in October, whereby the rebellious barons and their retainers received a pardon. The king nevertheless emerged strengthened from the events, while Warwick and Lancaster were largely marginalised. This all changed in 1314, when the king decided to stage his first major campaign against the Scots. Warwick and Lancaster refused to participate and the campaign ended in a humiliating English defeat at the Battle of <b>Bannockburn</b> on 24 June. This led to another political reversal and Edward was forced to reconfirm the Ordinances, and submit to the leadership of the rebellious barons.|$|E
5|$|The most {{detailed}} account of the Earl of Gloucester's death at the Battle of <b>Bannockburn</b> is the chronicle Vita Edwardi Secundi. This account is written as a moral tale, expounding on the earl's heroism and the cowardly conduct of his companions. For this reason, its historical accuracy must be taken with some caution. According to some accounts, Gloucester rushed headfirst into battle {{in the pursuit of}} glory, and fell victim to his own foolishness. The Vita, on the other hand, claimed that, as the earl was vigorously trying to fend off the Scottish attacks, he was knocked off his horse, and killed when his own men failed to come to his rescue. It is also likely that the quarrels between Gloucester and Hereford over precedence could have contributed to the chaotic situation. According to one account, Gloucester rushed into battle without a distinguishing coat of arms, exposing himself to the Scottish soldiers, who otherwise would have been eager to secure a valuable ransom.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{struggle}} changed significantly when Robert the Bruce, Earl of Carrick, killed his rival John Comyn on 10 February 1306 at Greyfriars Kirk in Dumfries. He was crowned king (as Robert I) less than seven weeks later. Robert I battled to restore Scottish Independence as King for over 20 years, beginning by winning Scotland back from the Norman English invaders piece by piece. Victory at the Battle of <b>Bannockburn</b> in 1314 proved the Scots had regained control of their kingdom. In 1315, Edward Bruce, brother of the King, was briefly appointed High King of Ireland during an ultimately unsuccessful Scottish invasion of Ireland aimed at strengthening Scotland's position in its wars against England. In 1320 the world's first documented declaration of independence, the Declaration of Arbroath, won the support of Pope John XXII, leading to the legal recognition of Scottish sovereignty by the English Crown.|$|E
5|$|These systems {{produced}} {{relatively large}} numbers of poorly armoured infantry, often armed with 12–14 foot spears. They often formed the large close order defensive formations of shiltrons, able to counter mounted knights as they did at <b>Bannockburn,</b> but vulnerable to arrows (and later artillery fire) and relatively immobile, as they proved at Halidon Hill. There were attempts to replace spears with longer pikes of 15½ to 18½ feet in the later 15th century, in emulation of successes over mounted troops in the Netherlands and Switzerland, {{but this does not}} appear to have been successful until the eve of the Flodden campaign in early 16th century. There were smaller numbers of archers and men-at-arms, which were often outnumbered when facing the English on the battlefield. Archers became much sought after as mercenaries in French armies of the 15th century to help counter the English superiority in this arm, becoming a major element of the French royal guards as the Garde Écossaise. Scottish men-at-arms often dismounted to fight beside the infantry, with perhaps a small mounted reserve, and it has been suggested that these tactics were copied and refined by the English, leading to their successes in the Hundred Years' War.|$|E
5|$|Thomas and {{his younger}} brother Henry served in the {{coronation}} of their cousin King Edward II of England on 25 February 1308; Thomas carried Curtana, the Sword of Mercy, and Henry carried the royal sceptre. After initially supporting Edward, Thomas became one of the Lords Ordainers, who demanded the banishment of Piers Gaveston and the governance of the realm by a baronial council. After Gaveston was captured, Thomas took the lead in his trial and execution at Warwick in 1312. Edward's authority was weakened by poor governance and defeat by the Scots at the Battle of <b>Bannockburn.</b> This allowed Thomas to restrain Edward's power by republishing the Ordinances of 1311. Following this achievement Thomas took little part in the governance of the realm and instead retreated to Pontefract Castle. This allowed Edward to regroup and re-arm, leading to a fragile peace in August 1318 with the Treaty of Leake. In 1321 Edward's rule again collapsed into civil war. Thomas raised a northern army but was defeated and captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge. He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered but because he was Edward's cousin he was given a quicker death by beheading.|$|E
5|$|Andre {{reveals that}} an idol of Baphomet has been {{discovered}} in Paris, and George gains access to the excavation. Using the chalice, he discovers {{an image of a}} church with a square tower. George returns to the Countess, and he discovers that the biblical references show a secret area inside a well containing a chessboard mural with a river running through it. Compiling their clues, George, Nicole and Andre decide that the Templars are going to <b>Bannockburn,</b> Scotland. George and Nicole board a train, but she and an old woman in their compartment soon go missing. He reaches the conductor's carriage, where the old woman, Khan in disguise, throws Flap out of the carriage. However, Khan is shot and killed by another man. George and Nicole reach the church {{in time to see the}} Grand Master of the Templars acquire a power from two huge Baphomet idols—the Sword of Baphomet, or the Broken Sword. After trying to tempt George to join their ranks, the Grand Master orders the couple to be killed, but they escape with the aid of explosives. The church explodes, killing Guido, the Templars and—presumably—the Grand Master. The game ends with George and Nico on their last date on the Eiffel Tower.|$|E
5|$|Late Medieval {{religion}} had {{its political}} aspects. Robert I carried the brecbennoch (or Monymusk reliquary), {{said to contain}} the remains of St. Columba, into battle at <b>Bannockburn.</b> In the Papal Schism (1378–1417), the Scottish church and crown sided with the Avignon Popes, beginning with Clement VII, along with France and other countries, while nations including England and the Holy Roman Empire sided with the Roman popes beginning with Urban VI. In 1383, Clement VII appointed Scotland's first cardinal, Walter Wardlaw, Bishop of Glasgow. The withdrawal of France from support of Clement's successor Benedict XIII created problems for Scottish clergy attending French universities and necessitated the creation of Scotland's first university at St. Andrews from 1411–13. Scotland {{was one of the}} last churches to abandon Benedict in favour of the compromise pope, Martin V, proposed by the Council of Constance (1414–28). In the subsequent debates over Conciliarism and the authority of the pope, between those who backed the church council as the ultimate authority in the Church, and those that backed the papacy, divisions in loyalty mirrored political divisions in the country and Church. King James I and his chancellor John Cameron, Archbishop of Glasgow, became conciliarists and William Croyser, Archdeacon of Teviotdale, the leading opponent of Cameron, became a papalist. After his accession, James II backed the Pope, while the Douglases, who had dominated politics in the years after James I's death, backed the conciliar movement.|$|E
5|$|Rivals John Comyn and Robert the Bruce, {{grandson}} of the claimant, were appointed as joint guardians in his place. On 10 February 1306, Bruce {{participated in the}} murder of Comyn, at Greyfriars Kirk in Dumfries. Less than seven weeks later, on 25 March, Bruce was crowned as king. However, Edward's forces overran the country after defeating Bruce's small army at the Battle of Methven. Despite the excommunication of Bruce and his followers by Pope Clement V, his support slowly strengthened; and by 1314 with the help of leading nobles such as Sir James Douglas and Thomas Randolph only the castles at Bothwell and Stirling remained under English control. Edward I had died in 1307. His heir Edward II moved an army north to break the siege of Stirling Castle and reassert control. Robert defeated that army at the Battle of <b>Bannockburn</b> in 1314, securing de facto independence. In 1320 the Declaration of Arbroath, a remonstrance to the pope from the nobles of Scotland, helped convince Pope John XXII to overturn the earlier excommunication and nullify the various acts of submission by Scottish kings to English ones so that Scotland's sovereignty could be recognised by the major European dynasties. The declaration has also been seen {{as one of the most}} important documents in the development of a Scottish national identity.|$|E
