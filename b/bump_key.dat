50|$|Lock bumping is a lock picking {{technique}} for opening a pin tumbler lock using a specially crafted <b>bump</b> <b>key,</b> rapping key or a 999 key. A <b>bump</b> <b>key</b> must {{correspond to the}} target lock in order to function correctly.|$|E
50|$|Creating a <b>bump</b> <b>key</b> {{does require}} the key {{being able to}} set pins to the proper rotation, so one <b>bump</b> <b>key</b> could not work for all locks. The Security.org team has shown that a {{relatively}} small number of keys (see above) could be used to do this.|$|E

50|$|Forced entry {{involves}} the use of tools such as hammers, bolt cutters, chisels, and drills; consequently, forced entry attacks exhibit obvious signs of entry. Surreptitious attacks involve picks, <b>bump</b> <b>keys,</b> shims, unauthorized key duplication, and other bypass techniques that, when employed, do not show obvious signs of compromise.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, two {{secondary}} school students Lau Tak Kin and Lau Tak Shing (not related) were awarded {{second place in the}} Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) for their invention of an [...] "anti-bump lock" [...] that can counter <b>bump</b> <b>keys.</b> Two minor planets (25065 and 25073) were named in their honour. In 2014, another student Kan Wing Yi was awarded second place in the Intel ISEF for her invention of biodegradable bandages that are breathable and do not cause allergies. A minor planet (31313) was named in her honour.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011 Troemel began {{a series}} of {{exhibitions}} with his use of Bitcoin and the Silk Road black market. For the exhibition [...] "The Social Life of Things" [...] in Rotterdam, Troemel used a number of objects from the marketplace including a Fake ID containing his real details and picture, <b>bump</b> <b>keys</b> and psychedelic drug seeds which were presented in an installation. Those objects were presented for free to be further used by visitors and Troemel himself used Silk Road-purchased identification to travel from New York to Rotterdam for the exhibition.|$|R
50|$|Locks {{that have}} trap pins that engage when a pin {{does not support}} them will jam a lock's cylinder. Another {{countermeasure}} is shallow drilling, in which {{one or more of}} the pin stacks is drilled slightly shallower than the others. If an attempt is made on a lock that has shallow drilled pin stacks, the <b>bump</b> <b>key</b> will be unable to bump the shallow drilled pins because they are too high for the <b>bump</b> <b>key</b> to engage.|$|E
50|$|Because a <b>bump</b> <b>key</b> must {{only have}} the same blank profile as the lock it is made to open, {{restricted}} or registered key profiles are not any safer from bumping. While the correct key blanks cannot be obtained legally without permission or registration with relevant locksmith associations, regular keys can be filed down to act as bump keys.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{pin tumbler}} lock alone is {{vulnerable}} to several lock picking methods and attacks, the most common being lock bumping and snap guns. To combat this, many higher security cylinders incorporate the use of specialised pins known as security pins which are designed to catch in the lock cylinder if a snap gun or <b>bump</b> <b>key</b> is used.|$|E
50|$|The manual pick gun (or snap gun) {{was invented}} by Ely Epstein. It usually has a trigger that creates a {{movement}} which (like <b>bump</b> <b>keys)</b> transfers sudden energy to the key pins which communicate this to the driver pins causing those pins only to jump, allowing the cylinder to turn freely for a brief moment, until the pin springs return the pins to their locking position. Electric versions are now also common, where by simply pressing a button the pins are vibrated while the normal torsion wrench is being used.|$|R

50|$|A US patent first {{appears in}} 1928 by H. R. Simpson called a rapping key. In the 1970s, locksmiths in Denmark shared a {{technique}} for knocking on a lock cylinder while applying slight {{pressure to the}} back of the lock plug. When the pins would jump the inside of the cylinder, the plug would be able to slide out freely, thus enabling the locksmith to disassemble the lock quickly. The use of a <b>bump</b> <b>key</b> was not introduced until some time later and was first recognized as a potential security problem around 2002 - 2003 by Klaus Noch, who brought it to the attention of the German media. After further examination of the procedure, a white paper was drafted in 2005 by Barry Wels & Rop Gonggrijp of The Open Organization Of Lockpickers (TOOOL) detailing the method and its applicability. A patent exists for a lock device following the same principle as the <b>bump</b> <b>key</b> from 1926 - 1928.|$|E

He studies escape routes, prison routines and buys a handgun. Struggling to obtain fake IDs, he loses much of his money. He sells his furniture and belongings. John is almost caught testing a <b>bump</b> <b>key</b> inside Lara's current jail.|$|E
5000|$|When bumping a lock, {{the key is}} {{initially}} inserted into the key way one notch (pin) short of full insertion. Bumping the key inward forces it deeper into the key way. The specially designed teeth of the <b>bump</b> <b>key</b> transmit a slight impact force {{to all of the}} bottom pins in the lock. The key pins transmit this force to the driver pins; the key pins stay in place. This physics action can be visualized by observing the same effect on the desktop toy: Newton's cradle. Because the pin movements are highly elastic, the driver pins [...] "jump" [...] from the key pins for a fraction of a second, moving higher than the cylinder (shear line of the tumbler), then are pushed normally back by the spring to sit against the key pins once again. Even though this separation only lasts a split second, if a light rotational force is continuously applied to the key during the slight impact, the cylinder will turn during the short separation time of the key and driver pins, and the lock can be opened while the driver pins are elevated above the key way. Lock bumping takes only an instant to open the lock. The lock is not visibly damaged, although the force of the bump can leave an indentation {{on the front of the}} cylinder. Certain clicking and vibrating tools designed for bumping can also be used. These allow for rapid repetition of bumping against locks that have advertised [...] "bump proof" [...] features. Only a rare few key-pin locks cannot be bumped.|$|E
5000|$|The Flexon's {{spring tongue}} had two advantages; the {{application}} of force was progressive, and the boot returned to its neutral position when the force was released in a smoothly controlled or [...] "dampened" [...] manner (this characteristic would endear the boot to downhill racers, who didn't want to be surprised by a lively return when encountering <b>bumps).</b> The <b>key</b> was {{to ensure that the}} flexing force remained under control even with extreme bending. The result was a smooth flex that started off soft and progressively stiffened, which also eliminated Lange-bang.|$|R
30|$|All events {{except for}} the November 2004 event display an {{increase}} in solar wind density almost simultaneously {{with an increase in}} the solar wind speed and a decrease in IMF Bz. The enhanced density reduced down to the pre-event level in 12 to 24 h, that is, when or before the IMF Bz negative excursion recovers to the pre-event level. These features indicate enhanced density in the magnetic cloud generated by a CME event. Such a density <b>bump</b> plays the <b>key</b> role in the extended model producing rapid recovery.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We analyze {{radially}} symmetric {{bumps in}} a two-dimensional piecewise-smooth neural field model with synaptic depression. The continuum dynamics {{is described in}} terms of a nonlocal integrodifferential equation, in which the integral kernel represents the spatial distribution of synaptic weights between populations of neurons whose mean firing rate is taken to be a Heaviside function of local activity. Synaptic depression dynamically reduces the strength of synaptic weights in response to increases in activity. We show {{that in the case of}} a Mexican hat weight distribution, sufficiently strong synaptic depression can destabilize a stationary bump solution that would be stable in the absence of depression. Numerically it is found that the resulting instability leads to the formation of a traveling spot. The local stability of a bump is determined by solutions to a system of pseudolinear equations that take into account the sign of perturbations around the circular <b>bump</b> boundary. <b>Key</b> words. neural fields, synaptic depression, piecewise-smooth dynamic...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we look at}} Henrik Ibsen’s Ghosts {{through a}} postmodernist window. In addition, a modest attempt {{has been made to}} analyze the {{theories}} of postmodernist literature in the play. In Ghosts there are both modern and postmodern characters as well as those oscillating between them. Using Derrida’s Deconstruction, religious ideas, dead beliefs and old traditions Ghosts can profit new looks from different angles. Sense of non-ending and sense of displacement are also spread all over the play. By the same token, fall of the grand-narratives, as an important postmodern element, is very tangible in the play. The importance of fall of the grand-narratives as a <b>bump</b> <b>key,</b> which opens the complicated locks of the play, persuades us to delve into Ghosts within postmodern bedrock...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{discusses}} whether elastic {{and plastic}} impacts and scratches caused by applied forces (e. g., car <b>bump,</b> <b>key</b> scratch etc.) to a parked vehicle {{can be distinguished}} by an autonomous system. The authors assume that a force impact to a vehicle stimulates characteristic frequencies in the vehicle body shell components {{that can be used}} to distinguish the given damages. Eight piezoelectric film sensors made of polyvinylidene fluoride mounted at the inside of the vehicle body shell components doors, bumpers, bonnet, and tailgate are used as the sensing element. An experimental modal analysis of several vehicle components is performed to identify characteristic frequencies. The results are used to compute the best sensor position in order to detect all considered eigenfrequencies of the component. A con-structed model set up for force generation was used to record reference data. Derived features of the reference signals are computed and assessed to their relevance of distinguishing the damages on the vehicle...|$|E
50|$|One {{interesting}} {{variation on}} double-hashing collision resolution is Robin Hood hashing. The {{idea is that}} a new key may displace a key already inserted, if its probe count is larger {{than that of the}} key at the current position. The net effect of this is that it reduces worst case search times in the table. This is similar to ordered hash tables except that the criterion for <b>bumping</b> a <b>key</b> does not depend on a direct relationship between the keys. Since both the worst case and the variation in the number of probes is reduced dramatically, an interesting variation is to probe the table starting at the expected successful probe value and then expand from that position in both directions.External Robin Hood hashing is an extension of this algorithm where the table is stored in an external file and each table position corresponds to a fixed-sized page or bucket with B records.|$|R
40|$|There {{are various}} {{techniques}} for defeating locks based on exploiting vibration. In recent years, {{one of these}} techniques for manipulating cylinder locks, called "bumping", has become widespread. The problem is that a large variety of mechanical locks can be opened quickly, in a non-‐destructive manner by using simple attack tools. We studied the physical phenomena responsible for the vibration techniques of lock opening. We considered {{the period of time}} during which the pins of a cylinder lock remain separated as a function of natural frequency, damping properties, and lock design parameters. On the basis of this analysis, we suggest some changes to lock design and assembly that can enhance the security of the lock and resist <b>bumping</b> attacks. <b>Key</b> words: locks, security lock, lock picking, bumping, design of secure locks Pin Tumbler Cylinder When people talk about "the cylinder lock " or “the pin tumbler cylinder”, they have in mind the classic locking mechanism invented by Linus Yale in 1861.

40|$|Shock control bumps are a {{promising}} device {{for improving the}} aerodynamic efficiency of high subsonic aircraft. From the previous research, the peak location and bump height are the most sensitive parameters, therefore the deployment position {{and size of the}} shock control <b>bump</b> are <b>key</b> factors. However, the position and size of shock control bumps are based on the designer’s experience and their view of shock location. In this paper, the mesh adjoint approach is employed to identify the sensitive areas on the wing surface in terms of the drag coefficient. An array of shock control bumps are then deployed in this areas and optimized. Moreover, a new shock control bump function is proposed based on the Class/Shape Transformation Methods (CST) to provide more flexibility of the design space and improved geometric continuity to satisfy C 2 condition {{at the edge of the}} bumps. The results show that the mesh adjoint approach successfully identifies the drag sensitive areas on the upper wing and assist in the deployment of the shock control bump quickly, and the CST bump provides a highly flexible design space to achieve an optimal solution...|$|R
40|$|Shock control bumps are a {{promising}} device {{for improving the}} aerodynamic efficiency of transonic aircraft. From the literature, the peak location and bump height are the most sensitive parameters, therefore the deployment position {{and size of the}} shock control <b>bump</b> are <b>key</b> factors. When placing a flow control device it is highly dependent on the designers’ experience and their view of the area where the device will be most effective. In this paper, the mesh adjoint approach is employed to identify the regions where the drag coefficient is sensitive to a change of the wing surface. An array of shock control bumps are then deployed in the areas of sensitivity and optimized using a gradient based approach. In addition to the sensitivity in the shock regions a non-shock region is identified using the sensitivity map on the wing. This region is not identified in other plots such as pressure or skin friction and could be overlooked by a designer without the sensitivity map. The results show that the mesh adjoint approach successfully identifies the drag sensitive areas on the upper wing and assists in the deployment of the bump arrays quickly, and the class/shape function transformation (CST) bump provides a highly flexible design space, with a large number of design variables, to achieve an optimal solution...|$|R
40|$|Flip chip {{technology}} is a key driver for new complex system architectures and high-density packaging, e. g. sensor or pixel devices. <b>Bumped</b> wafers/dice as <b>key</b> elements become very {{important in terms of}} general availability at low cost, high yield and quality level.

40|$|The blue-shifted broad {{emission}} lines and/or broad {{absorption lines}} seen in many luminous quasars are striking {{evidence for a}} broad line region in which radiation driving plays an important role. We consider {{the case for a}} similar role for radiation driving beyond the dust sublimation radius by focussing on the infrared regime where the relationship between luminosity and the prominence of the 3 - 5 micron <b>bump</b> may be <b>key.</b> To investigate this further, we apply the 3 D hydrodynamic wind model of Everett (2005) to predict the infrared spectral energy distributions of quasars.

40|$|There is {{a steady}} trend to ultra-thin microelectronic devices. Especially for future {{particle}} detector systems a reduced readout chip thickness {{is required to}} limit the loss of tracking precision due to scattering. The reduction of silicon thickness is performed at wafer level in a two-step thinning process. To {{minimize the risk of}} wafer breakage the thinned wafer needs to be handled by a carrier during the whole process chain of wafer <b>bumping.</b> Another <b>key</b> process is the flip chip assembly of thinned readout chips onto thin sensor tiles. Besides the prevention of silicon breakage the minimization of chip warpage is one additional task for a high yield and reliable flip chip process. A new technology using glass carrier wafer will be described in detail. The main advantage of this technology is the combination of a carrier support during wafer processing and the chip support during flip chip assembly. For that a glass wafer is glue-bonded onto the backside of the thinned readout chip wafer. After the bump deposition process the glass-readout chip stack is diced in one step. Finally the glass carrier chip is released by laser illumination after flip chip assembly of the readout chip onto sensor tile. The results of the flip chip assembly process development for the ATLAS IBL upgrade are described more in detail. The new ATLAS FEI 4 B chip with a size of 20 × 19 mm 2 is flip chip bonded with a thickness of only 150 m, but the capability of this technology has been demonstrated on hybrid modules with a reduced readout chip thickness of down to 50 m which is a major step for ultra-thin electronic systems...|$|R
40|$|These days, it’s inevitable: {{writing and}} {{composition}} teachers are becom-ing media literacy teachers. As the Internet and computing technologies have created {{new forms of}} expression and communication that are multivocal, multimodal, collaborative, public, instantaneously accessible, and sometimes anonymously authored, anyone {{in the business of}} helping students develop the capacity for self-expression and communication <b>bumps</b> into <b>key</b> concepts of media literacy education. As Brian Morrison (qtd. in Yancey, 2004) pointed out, in the 21 st century, composition is “the thoughtful gathering, construction or reconstruction of a literate act in any given media ” (p. 315). Writing teachers, typically tuned in to issues of identity, voice, and power, require sensitivity to how form and content interact when symbolic forms include not only printed language, but also sound, including the spoken word and music to name only a few, and still and moving images. These messages come to us through diverse forms that are variously commodified or non-commodified in an increasingly dense digital environment where economic, political, and social contexts shape both the creation and reception of messages. Composition educators recognize the rapidly shifting tectonic plates we are now facing in education. Kathleen Yancey (2004) recommended that writing and composition educators must develop a new curriculum for the 21 st cen-tury, one that expands beyond its roots in the intense and personal tutorial relationship between the teacher and the writer. According to Yancey, students need to consider how their compositions relate to “real world ” genres; what the best medium and best delivery might be and so create and share different forms of communication via different media to divergent audiences; and how to adapt ideas across different media genres and technological forms.

40|$|Inkjet {{printing}} technology has merits such as simple manufacturing process, low cost, small pollution source and high productivity. It is utilized {{in the production}} of printed electronics, Radio Frequency (RF) devices and flexible displays [1 - 2]. A new application includes bump fabrication to electrically connect chip and substrate on semiconductor packages. In practice, wire bonding technology has been mainly used for these electrical connections, which can be bonded at a low price. At higher frequencies, however, the wire bonding technique reaches the limit for RF applications, because the bonding wire generates a parasitic inductance that degrades the transmission characteristics. On the other hand, flip chip bonding technology has been developed to overcome the disadvantages of wire bonding [3]. Although flip chip bonding technology can be performed minimizing the distance between chip and substrate, the bump fabrication process is very complex. To solve the disadvantage of flip-chip bonding, we propose a new technique, using inkjet-printed <b>bump</b> technology. The <b>key</b> of this technology is to make bumps using inkjet {{printing technology}}, which is cheaper and simpler when compared to the flip chip bonding method. This paper presents a transmission line for direct current (DC T-line) bonded using inkjet-printed bumps.
