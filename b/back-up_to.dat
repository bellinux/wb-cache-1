5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2005–06 season, Emery had won nine-straight games during the regular season as the <b>back-up</b> <b>to</b> Dominik Hašek. When Hašek injured his groin during the 2006 Winter Olympics, Emery became the team's de facto starter, with Mike Morrison, claimed off of waivers from the Edmonton Oilers, as Emery's backup. Emery would be the starting goaltender {{for the rest of the}} season, leading the Senators to the second round of the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs.|$|E

5|$|Hextall's first {{international}} recognition {{came when he}} was named as part of Team Canada's squad for the 1987 Canada Cup. During a practice session, he chopped Sylvain Turgeon's arm with his stick during a scrimmage, claiming that the left wing {{was too close to}} the goal. Turgeon missed the tournament with a fractured arm; Hextall was <b>back-up</b> <b>to</b> Grant Fuhr and did not play a single game. He later represented Canada in the 1992 World Championships, playing five games to record one win and a GAA of 2.86 as Canada were eliminated in the quarter-finals.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Chappuis {{played for}} the Chicago Hornets, also of the AAFC, but saw only limited playing time as a <b>back-up</b> <b>to</b> Hoernschemeyer and Johnny Clement {{on a team that}} went 4–10. When the AAFC went out of {{existence}} after the 1949 season, Chappuis retired from football. In announcing his retirement in June 1950, Chappuis said he was through with professional football and that his ambition then was to enjoy a more leisurely lifestyle {{and to be able to}} visit Ann Arbor for those fall football games.|$|E
5|$|Lucasfilm Games re-submitted the edited {{version of}} Maniac Mansion to Nintendo, which then {{manufactured}} 250,000 cartridges. Each cartridge was {{fitted with a}} battery-powered <b>back-up</b> <b>to</b> save data. Nintendo announced the port through its official magazine in early 1990, and it provided further coverage later that year. The ability to microwave a hamster remained in the game, which Crockford cited {{as an example of}} the censors' contradictory criteria. However, Nintendo later noticed it, and after the first batch of cartridges was sold, Jaleco was forced to remove the content from future shipments.|$|E
5|$|When {{profiling}} Kane in February 2013, Talksport {{said that}} he was best as a second striker, despite also having ability as a centre forward or in a wide position. They wrote that he preferred to place his shots, although he could also score from distance. The report also noted that he had good pace, but was weak in the air and had not scored on his loan at Norwich. Initially a <b>back-up</b> <b>to</b> £26million Spanish import Roberto Soldado and frequently loaned out, Kane was eventually made Tottenham's starting forward by manager Mauricio Pochettino.|$|E

5|$|Columbus also traded {{former first}} round draft pick Nikita Filatov to the Ottawa Senators for a third-round {{pick in the}} 2011 Draft. Filatov had {{failed to live up}} to {{expectations}} in Columbus, playing in only 44 games over three seasons scoring six goals. Prior to the start of the season, the Blue Jackets were questioned for not signing a veteran <b>back-up</b> <b>to</b> starting goaltender Steve Mason, as the former Calder Memorial Trophy winner had struggled in consecutive seasons. The Blue Jackets signed Mark Dekanich as the back-up who had only 50 minutes of NHL experience prior to the start of the season. Columbus did sign a veteran Curtis Sanford to be their third string goaltender and to start for their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Falcons. Sanford had not played in the NHL since 2009. During training camp, Dekanich suffered a high ankle sprain that was expected to keep him out of the line-up for a month. Additionally, Sanford suffered a groin injury, leaving Allen York as the back-up. York had only played four professional games, all in the AHL, entering the season.|$|E
5|$|Hasselbaink {{came to the}} {{attention}} of Netherlands manager Guus Hiddink whilst playing in England for Leeds United, and made his international debut on 27 May 1998 in a 0–0 draw in a friendly with Cameroon at the GelreDome in Arnhem; he came on as a 61st-minute substitute for Marc Overmars. On 1 June he scored his first goal in a 5–1 friendly victory over Paraguay, and a few days later scored his second goal in another 5–1 friendly victory over Nigeria. He was part of the Dutch squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, as <b>back-up</b> <b>to</b> established international strikers Patrick Kluivert, Dennis Bergkamp and Pierre van Hooijdonk and wingers Boudewijn Zenden and Marc Overmars. With other strikers not fully fit, Hasselbaink started the opening game against Belgium at the Stade de France, but missed a scoring opportunity in the 0–0 draw and was taken off for Bergkamp after 65 minutes. Kluivert was sent off in the match but Bergkamp was played as the only striker in the next game against South Korea, and van Hooijdonk was taken off the bench to replace him. In the third group game against Mexico at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard Hasselbaink came on for Bergkamp after 78 minutes, which was to be his last appearance at the tournament as Kluivert returned from suspension to leave Hasselbaink as Hiddink's fourth choice forward; Netherlands ended the tournament in fourth place.|$|E

The old generators have remained offline (1920kW) but are available as <b>back-up</b> <b>to</b> the main system.

25|$|With a {{contract}} signed in 1991, AECL, {{in partnership with}} MDS Nordion, began construction of the MAPLE dedicated isotope-production facility. Constructed on-site at AECL's Chalk River Laboratories this facility will house two reactors and an isotope processing facility. Each reactor {{is designed to be}} able to produce at least 100% of the world's medical isotopes, meaning that the second reactor will be used as a <b>back-up</b> <b>to</b> ensure an uninterruptible supply. The first reactor was started but did not satisfy some safety requirements. AECL halted the project in 2008 because the design was flawed.|$|E

25|$|He {{was only}} briefly a regular first-choice player for the side, as a left-back in 2000 under Kevin Keegan's management. He later {{struggled}} to make the squad with players such as Wayne Bridge being preferred as <b>back-up</b> <b>to</b> Ashley Cole. He, nonetheless, once briefly captained the side in a friendly match (a game in which England fielded four different captains). Despite having been in the England squad at the 1996, 2000 and 2004 European Championships, and having 59 England caps (23 as a substitute), Neville was never in an England World Cup squad.|$|E

To offset those losses, Burke signed forward Todd Bertuzzi and defenseman Mathieu Schneider. During the season, Burke put goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov on waivers, where he was picked-up by the Phoenix Coyotes. Free agent signee Jonas Hiller then became the <b>back-up</b> <b>to</b> starter Jean-Sebastien Giguere. Both Selanne and Niedermayer would {{ultimately}} return and the team finished with a 47–27–8 record, good enough to earn home ice advantage {{in the first round}} of the playoffs finishing as the fourth seed in the Western Conference.
