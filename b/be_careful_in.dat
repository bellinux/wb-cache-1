Some detractors argue {{that one must}} <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> interpreting the operation of dedicated or segregated bikeways/cycle facilities across different designs and contexts; what works for the Netherlands won't necessarily work elsewhere. Proponents argue that dedicated bike lanes have been implemented in many cities and are both popular and safe.|$|E
25|$|Some people, of course, {{have gone}} {{overboard}} with this search, and caution must be employed; otherwise, {{it is possible}} to find chiasmus in the telephone book, and the effort becomes meaningless …. One must <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> this quest, however, to avoid the problems of the 'hammer syndrome'—to the person holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail. To the person who knows only chiasmus and no other form of literary composition, everything may start looking like a chiasm.|$|E

During that time, {{when he went to the}} Café for a coffee, he met an {{acquaintance}} who told him to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> the war, to which Batra replied: I'll either come back after raising the Indian flag in victory or return wrapped in it.

25|$|Finally, an {{individual}} strand may exhibit a mixed bonding pattern, with a parallel strand {{on one side}} and an antiparallel strand on the other. Such arrangements are less common than a random distribution of orientations would suggest, suggesting that this pattern is less stable than the anti-parallel arrangement, however bioinformatic analysis always struggles with extracting structural thermodynamics since there are always numerous other structural features present in whole proteins. Also proteins are inherently constrained by folding kinetics as well as folding thermodynamics, so one must always <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> concluding stability from bioinformatic analysis.|$|E
25|$|If {{the best}} hand {{is shared by}} more than one player, then the pot is split equally among them, with any extra chips going to the first players after the button in {{clockwise}} order. It is common for players to have closely valued, but not identically ranked hands. Nevertheless, one must <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> determining the best hand; if the hand involves fewer than five cards, (such as two pair or three of a kind), then kickers are used to settle ties (see the second example below). The card's numerical rank is of sole importance; suit values are irrelevant in hold 'em.|$|E
25|$|In {{discussing}} {{myths about}} Janus, one should <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> distinguishing {{those which are}} ancient and originally Latin and those others which were later attributed to him by Greek mythographers. In the Fasti Ovid relates only the myths that associate Janus with Saturn, whom he welcomed as a guest and with whom he eventually shared his kingdom in reward for teaching the art of agriculture, and to the nymph Crane Grane or Carna, whom Janus raped and made the goddess of hinges as Cardea, while in the Metamorphoses he records his fathering with Venilia the nymph Canens, loved by Picus, first legendary king of the Aborigines.|$|E

He warns {{that he is in}} for the most dangerous night of his life and for the guests to <b>be</b> <b>careful.</b> <b>In</b> this scene, a series of synchronized effects are used to simulate Spider-Man jumping on the Scoop. Nearly missing a trash truck driven by a Stan Lee cameo, the guests enter a warehouse where the Sinister Syndicate are holding the Statue of Liberty hostage. Once spotted, Electro, Scream, and Doctor Octopus attack and hurl the Scoop into the sewer, where Spider-Man is waiting. After he fends off Hydro-Man and Doctor Octopus there, the guests escape narrowly to the river where Hobgoblin attacks with exploding pumpkins and sends guests into the streets.|$|E
500|$|After Early and Breckinridge (who was {{now able}} to ride a horse) chased Hunter more than sixty {{miles away from the}} city, Lee ordered them to clear the Union forces from the Shenandoah Valley, then cross into Maryland and probe the {{defenses}} of Washington, D.C. Union forces' only serious attempt to turn back the expedition came at the Battle of Monocacy on July 9. Confederate troops were delayed, but ultimately prevailed and continued toward Washington. They were defeated at the Battle of Fort Stevens on July 11–12, partially with reinforcements brought in by the United States Government with the time gained from the Battle of Monocacy. Since Lincoln was watching the fight from the ramparts of Fort Stevens, this marked only time in American history in which two former opponents in a presidential election faced one another across battle lines. Following the battle, Early decided to withdraw rather than assault the well-fortified federal capital. Early and Breckinridge were able to hold the Shenandoah Valley through July and August, but on September 19, 1864, Philip Sheridan forced their retreat at the Third Battle of Winchester. Responding to General John Brown Gordon's admonition to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> the fight, Breckinridge responded, [...] "Well, general, there is little left for me if our cause is to fail." ...|$|E
500|$|The 150-person team {{consisted}} {{mainly of}} first-person shooter veterans or longtime Rainbow Six players. Despite having prior knowledge on how {{these types of}} games work, the team decided to study historic examples of counter-terrorist operations, including 1980's London Iranian Embassy siege, 1997's Lufthansa Flight 181 hijacking, and 2002's Moscow theater hostage crisis {{to ensure that the}} portrayal of these operations was accurate and appropriate. The team also consulted counter-terrorism units, such as the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group (GIGN), for their opinions on how they would react during a hostage rescue situation. According to Xavier Marquis, the game's creative director, having a hostage rescue mission in the game helped create an immersive story. By allowing players to assume control of an operator tasked with saving innocents, it gives them an objective and a priority. They must <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> dealing with the situation and try their best not to hurt the hostage. This further promotes teamwork between players and prompts them to plan before attacking, and further makes the game more realistic, tense and immersive. To make the game feel more realistic, the team introduced a mechanic called [...] "living hostage" [...] to govern the hostage character's behavior – e.g., coughing if there is dust in the air or shielding herself if there is nearby gunfire.|$|E

Besides this, the police printed 10,000 wanted posters and 75,000 pamphlets with different photographic profiles of Jaishankar, in 5 languages: Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu. Besides Karnataka, these posters and pamphlets were distributed across Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Maharashtra.|$|E
2500|$|It {{became a}} vehicle for evangelization of students, {{as well as the}} {{recruiting}} and training of native men to the Catholic clergy; it was a {{center for the study of}} native languages, especially Nahuatl. The college contributed to the establishment of Catholic Christianity in New Spain and became an important institution for cultural exchange. Sahagún taught Latin and other subjects during its initial years. Other friars taught grammar, history, religion, scripture, and philosophy. Native leaders were recruited to teach about native history and traditions, leading to controversy among colonial officials who were concerned with controlling the indigenous populations. [...] During this period, Franciscans who affirmed the full humanity and capacity of indigenous people were perceived as suspect by colonial officials and the Dominican Order. Some of the latter competitors hinted that the Friars were endorsing idolatry. The friars had to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> pursuing and defining their interactions with indigenous people.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} reagents {{which can be used}} to label terminal amino acids. They all react with amine groups and will therefore also bind to amine groups in the side chains of amino acids such as lysine - for this reason it is necessary to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> interpreting chromatograms to ensure that the right spot is chosen. Two of the more common reagents are Sanger's reagent (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) and dansyl derivatives such as dansyl chloride. Phenylisothiocyanate, the reagent for the Edman degradation, can also be used. The same questions apply here as in the determination of amino acid composition, with the exception that no stain is needed, as the reagents produce coloured derivatives and only qualitative analysis is required. [...] So the amino acid {{does not have to be}} eluted from the chromatography column, just compared with a standard. Another consideration to take into account is that, since any amine groups will have reacted with the labelling reagent, ion exchange chromatography cannot be used, and thin layer chromatography or high-pressure liquid chromatography should be used instead.|$|E

Several of his friends commented on the picture, and one advised him to <b>be</b> <b>careful.</b> <b>In</b> 2013, he posted a picture on his Instagram of a tattoo displaying a figure with a gas mask. In the description, Tobares stated that the tattoo was a gift from a [...] "man who [...] of key importance in Culiacán, Sinaloa", but the text was part of a narcocorrido, a Mexican drug ballad. On YouTube, he posted videos of his travels through Jalisco's towns and highways.|$|E
2500|$|An {{introductory}} paragraph {{added to}} the Book of Mormon in the LDS Church's 1981 edition stated in part: [...] "After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, {{and they are the}} principal ancestors of the American Indians." [...] In a 2006 edition, the statement was altered to indicate that [...] "the Lamanites ... are among the ancestors of the American Indians." [...] This change, church leaders said, was in harmony with the claims of the Book of Mormon itself, and what some Latter-day Saints had long perceived. For instance, in 1929 Anthony W. Ivins, of the LDS Church's First Presidency, cautioned church members: “We must <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> the conclusions that we reach. The Book of Mormon teaches the history of three distinct peoples … who came from the old world to this continent. It does not tell us that there was no one here before them. It does not tell us that people did not come after. And so if discoveries are made which suggest differences in race origins, it can very easily be accounted for, and reasonably, for we do believe that other people came to this continent. A thousand years had elapsed from the time the Book of Mormon closed until the discovery of America, and we know that other people came to America during that period.” ...|$|E
