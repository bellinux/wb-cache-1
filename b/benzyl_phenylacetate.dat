40|$|Dibenzyl {{carbonate}} (DBzlC) {{has been}} used to benzylate phenylacetonitrile, <b>benzyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> and phenol. In refluxing N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent, and in the presence of K,C 03 phenol yielded benzyl phenyl ether and phenylacetonitrile the monobenzylated compound 2, 3 -diphenylpropionitrile. Likewise, in refluxing N,N-diethylformamide (DEF), benzyl phenyl acetate gave the benzyl 2, 3 -diphenylpropionate. Selectivity in mono-C-benzyl derivatives was 98 - 99...|$|E
40|$|Singlet and triplet benzyl radical pairs {{have been}} {{generated}} on silica gel by photolysis of a <b>benzyl</b> <b>phenylacetate,</b> a dibenzyl ketone, and a dibenzyl sulfone. The extent of geminate radical recombination has been measured and requires that translational motion of radicals {{occur on the}} silica gel surface. This motion was affected by the radical pair multiplicity and the photolysis temperature, but was relatively insensitive {{to the state of}} hydration of the silica gel and the presence of coadsorbates. The presence of certain rearranged starting materials, which are not formed in solution, amongst the products from photolysis of both dibenzyl ketone and dibenzyl sulfone on silica gel indicates the restrictions on radical movement on the surface on the shorter timescale of the benzyl and benzyl benzyl sulfonyl radical pairs.

40|$|A toluene-degrading sulfate-reducing bacterium, strain Tol 2, was {{isolated}} from marine sediment under strictly anoxic conditions. Toluene was toxic if applied {{directly to the}} medium at concentrations higher than 0. 5 mM. To provide toluene continuously at a nontoxic concentration, it was supplied in an inert hydrophobic carrier phase. The isolate had oval, sometimes motile cells (1. 2 to 1. 4 by 1. 2 to 2. 0 microns). The doubling time was 27 h. Toluene was completely oxidized to CO 2, as demonstrated by measurement of the degradation balance. The presence of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase indicated a terminal oxidation of acetyl coenzyme A via the CO dehydrogenase pathway. The use of hypothetical intermediates of toluene degradation was tested in growth experiments and adaptation studies with dense cell suspensions. Results do not support a degradation of toluene via one of the cresols or methylbenzoates, <b>benzyl</b> alcohol, or <b>phenylacetate</b> as free intermediate. Benzyl alcohol did not serve as growth substrate; moreover, it was a strong, specific inhibitor of toluene degradation, whereas benzoate utilization was not affected by benzyl alcohol. Sequencing of 16 S rRNA revealed a relationship to the metabolically dissimilar genus Desulfobacter and on a deeper level to the genus Desulfobacterium. The new genus and species Desulfobacula toluolica is proposed...|$|R
