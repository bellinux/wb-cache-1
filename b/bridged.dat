5|$|An {{area the}} Reform Act {{did not address}} was the issue of {{municipal}} and regional government. As a result of archaic traditions, many English counties had enclaves and exclaves, which were mostly abolished in the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844. Furthermore, many new conurbations and economic areas <b>bridged</b> traditional county boundaries by having been formed in previously obscure areas: the West Midlands conurbation <b>bridged</b> Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire, Manchester and Liverpool both had hinterlands in Cheshire but city centres in Lancashire, while in the south Oxford's developing southern suburbs were in Berkshire and London was expanding into Essex, Surrey and Middlesex. This led to further acts to reorganise county boundaries {{in the late nineteenth}} and twentieth centuries.|$|E

5|$|The final {{song of the}} Bat trilogy is a {{short one}} written by Steinman. A few lyrics of Cry to Heaven begin rather sweet, but turning rather bitter: (Cry baby cry/Cry, cry to heaven/If that doesn't do it for you/Go ahead and cry like hell.) The two parts are <b>bridged</b> by an {{instrumental}} dominated by an Irish flute.|$|E
5|$|Athens was {{prevented}} from sending more effective aid by events on Euboea in 348 BC. A pre-eminent politician from Chalcis, Callias, sought {{to unite the}} cities of Euboea in a new confederation, inevitably meaning {{the end of the}} hitherto strong Athenian presence on the island. Strategically, this was unacceptable for the Athenians. In 410 BC, the strait between Euboea and the mainland, the Euripos, had been narrowed, and then <b>bridged</b> at Chalcis. If Euboea, and in particular Chalcis, was no longer controlled by Athens then Philip could potentially cross into Euboea from Thessaly, and then cross back into Boeotia via the bridge at Chalcis, thus outflanking Thermopylae. The whole Athenian strategy in the years after 352 BC therefore required that they hold Euboea.|$|E
5|$|In April 1901, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad {{announced}} track {{depression and}} raising throughout {{portions of the}} line through Newark and the Oranges. Although the depression went into Newark, most {{of the debate over}} localities of stations was basically into the Oranges. In 1903, the track depression reached the Roseville Avenue Station, and the lines were depressed through Roseville. The new station built during the track depression was of similar style, with the station {{in the middle of the}} five-track interlocking, with one platform servicing the Montclair Branch's two tracks and one for the Main Line's two tracks. Rather than crossing at-grade, Roseville Avenue was <b>bridged</b> over the tracks with a brand new street-level interlocking tower present at the intersection of Roseville and Seventh Avenues.|$|E

5|$|In August 1956 Atrash married teacher Hind al-Shuwayri, an Christian and the {{daughter}} of Yusuf al-Shuwayri, Sultan's partner in the grain trade, who was based in al-Midan and owned a house in al-Qurayya. Atrash had a son named Tha'er and a daughter named Rim. Because Atrash's wife was not from the Druze community, the marriage caused a temporary schism between Atrash and his father. Eventually the two <b>bridged</b> their differences. Following Sultan's death in 1982, Mansur gained the latter's role as the major spokesman for the al-Atrash clan.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth was a {{significant}} settlement in Roman Britain, as the border fort of Blestium and as an important centre for ironworking. It is possible the Romans <b>bridged</b> the River Wye during their occupation, but the Monnow appears not {{to have had a}} crossing until after the Norman invasion. The Norman lord William FitzOsbern built a castle near the confluence of the two rivers in around 1070. The following two centuries saw the establishment of the Benedictine Priory and the development of the town as a defensive location on the Welsh Marches.|$|E
5|$|The confessional {{conflicts}} {{that dominated the}} relations between the ruling city authorities were only secondary to the peasants of the Huttwil league. The peasant alliance <b>bridged</b> the confessional divide, uniting Catholic people from the Entlebuch and from Solothurn with Protestant peasants from the Emmental and from Basel. The treaty of Huttwil explicitly recognized this biconfessionalism. The cities remained in all their manoeuvring and negotiations for military support within their respective confessional spheres: Catholic Lucerne had requested mediation and then military help from the Catholic central Swiss cantons, while Protestant Bern had turned to Protestant Zürich for help. The distrust between the authorities of the Catholic and Protestant cantons was so deep that none would allow troops of the other confession to operate on their territories.|$|E

5|$|The first {{railroad}} in Indiana {{was built}} in Shelbyville in the late 1830s. The first major line was completed in 1847, connecting Madison with Indianapolis. By the 1850s, the railroad began to become popular in Indiana. The railroad brought major changes to Indiana and enhanced the state's economic growth. Although Indiana's natural waterways connected it to the South via cities such as St. Louis and New Orleans, the new rail lines ran East-West, and connected Indiana with the economies of the northern states. As late as mid-1859, no rail line yet <b>bridged</b> the Ohio or Mississippi rivers. Because of an increased demand on the state's resources and the embargo against the Confederacy, the rail system was mostly completed {{by the end of}} the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The peak {{years of}} {{psychedelic}} rock were between 1966 and 1969, with milestone events including the 1967 Summer of Love and the 1969 Woodstock Rock Festival, becoming an international musical movement {{associated with a}} widespread counterculture before beginning a decline as changing attitudes, the loss of some key individuals and a back-to-basics movement, led surviving performers to move into new musical areas. The genre <b>bridged</b> the transition from early blues and folk-based rock to progressive rock and hard rock, {{and as a result}} contributed to the development of sub-genres such as heavy metal. Since the late 1970s it has been revived in various forms of neo-psychedelia.|$|E
5|$|The town's heyday as a {{seaside resort}} {{was during the}} late Victorian era; the {{population}} nearly doubled from 4,410 to 8,442 between 1881 and 1901. Much of the resulting late Victorian seafront architecture is still in existence today. In 1910, a pavilion {{was added to the}} landward end of the pier. By 1931, the town's population had grown to 14,533. At the beginning of World War II, the army cut two gaps between the landward end of the pier and the seaward terminal as a counter-invasion measure. The pier's two gaps were <b>bridged</b> for pedestrians however after the war.|$|E

5|$|As the Giro left Austria, {{the race}} began {{to enter the}} Dolomites during stage fourteen. The {{eventual}} stage winner Marco Pantani was in a chasing group on the final climb of the stage, the Passo di Monte Giovo. He attacked, <b>bridged</b> the gap to the leading group, and left them behind to claim his first professional victory of his career. The next stage saw Pantani win again after he rode away from the attack group on the last climb of the Valico di Santa Cristina and he then soloed to the finish in Stradella. Pantani's efforts on the day moved him up to second overall in the race. The race's sixteenth stage took {{a break from the}} mountains with the stage being primarily fled, which ultimately led to the sprint finish that was won by Italian Maximilian Sciandri. Ján Svorada won the next day's stage after attacking from the breakaway group in the closing seconds.|$|E
5|$|Between 1928 {{until his}} death, al-Qassam {{served as the}} {{president}} of the Young Men's Muslim Association (YMMA) in Haifa. While he focused his activism with the lower classes, his position in the YMMA afforded him access with the middle and educated classes of the city who were attracted to Hizb al-Istiqlal (Independence Party), an Arab nationalist political party. In particular, he developed a strong relationship with leading local party member Rashid al-Hajj Ibrahim, the previous president of the Haifa YMMA. A wide ideological gap between the secularist al-Istiqlal and al-Qassam was <b>bridged</b> by a convergence in the view that the struggle against Zionist expansion in Palestine was inseparable from active opposition to British rule. This view separated al-Qassam and al-Istiqlal from the mainstream political forces in Palestine at the time. While men from al-Istiqlal and the YMMA generally refrained from joining al-Qassam's cause, his association with them helped protect him from political figures who opposed his activism. His activities were also financed by several well-off businessmen associated with al-Istiqlal due to his spreading reputation.|$|E
5|$|Darius {{therefore}} began {{raising a}} huge new army {{with which he}} meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece. Since {{this was to be}} a full-scale invasion, it required long-term planning, stock-piling and conscription. Xerxes decided that the Hellespont would be <b>bridged</b> to allow his army to cross to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC). These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any contemporary state. By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army Xerxes had mustered at Sardis marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges.|$|E
