2500|$|Double wire, twin loop, or Wire-O binding {{is a type}} of binding that is {{used for}} books that will be viewed or read in an office or home type environment. The binding {{involves}} the use of a [...] "C" [...] shaped wire spine that is squeezed into a round shape using a wire closing device. Double wire binding allows books to have smooth crossover and is affordable in many colors. This binding is great for annual reports, owners manuals and software manuals. Wire bound books are made of individual sheets, each punched with a line of round or square holes on the <b>binding</b> <b>edge.</b> This type of binding uses either a 3:1 pitch hole pattern with three holes per inch or a 2:1 pitch hole pattern with two holes per inch. The three to one hole pattern is used for smaller books that are up to 9/16" [...] in diameter while the 2:1 pattern is normally used for thicker books as the holes are slightly bigger to accommodate slightly thicker, stronger wire. Once punched, the back cover is then placed on to the front cover ready for the wire binding elements (double loop wire) to be inserted. The wire is then placed through the holes. The next step involves the binder holding the book by its pages and inserting the wire into a [...] "closer" [...] which is basically a vise that crimps the wire closed and into its round shape. The back page can then be turned back to its correct position, thus hiding the spine of the book.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} hole pattern used with coil binding is a 4:1 pitch hole pattern (6 mm outside the US), which has four holes per inch along the <b>binding</b> <b>edge</b> of the sheets of paper. The holes for this style are usually either round or oval shaped and {{depending}} on the size and spacing of the hole pattern, there will be 43 or 44 holes on an eleven-inch <b>binding</b> <b>edge.</b> Supplies for binding documents with 4:1 pitch spiral coil are available in sizes ranging from 6 mm up to 50 mm in diameter. This allows for binding documents that are up to two inches thick.|$|E

40|$|We {{show how}} a {{sinusoidal}} fringe pattern {{can be obtained}} by using a single cube beam splitter based on the Gates’ interferometer configuration. When an expanded and collimated laser beam hits the <b>binding</b> <b>edge</b> of a nonpolarizing cube beam splitter parallel to the splitter coating, it generates interference fringes at the exit due to the internal reflections and refractions of the laser beam passing through the cube. Unlike common digital projection systems, the proposed optical arrangement generates a perfectly sinusoidal and continuous fringe pattern, minimizing the problems associated with the discretization of a synthetic digital signal. The fast Fourier transform and phase-shifting techniques are used to demodulate the captured fringe patterns. Experimental results are presented for the three-dimensional shape reconstruction of the relief of a coin and of a spherical indentation on a piece of aluminum with a maximum height of about 150 μm.

40|$|XQBE (XQuery By Example) is {{a visual}} dialect of XQuery which, coherently with the XML data model, uses hierar-chical {{structures}} to express transformations between XML documents. These structures are annotated to express se-lection predicates; explicit <b>binding</b> <b>edges</b> connect the nodes of such structures {{to visualize the}} input/output mappings. XSLT, the standard transformation language for XML, is increasingly popular among programmers and Web devel-opers for separating the application and presentation lay-ers of Web applications.

40|$|XQuery, the {{standard}} query language for XML, is increasingly popular among computer scientists with SQL background, since XQuery and SQL require comparable skills. However, these experts {{are limited in}} number, {{and the availability of}} easier XQuery “dialects” could be extremely valuable. With this motivation in mind, we designed XQBE, a visual dialect of XQuery inspired by the QBE language (Query by Example). Coherent with the hierarchical nature of XML, XQBE uses one or more hierarchical structures to denote the input documents and one structure to denote the document produced in output. These structures are annotated to express selection predicates; explicit <b>binding</b> <b>edges</b> connecting the nodes of these structures visualize the input/output mappings. This paper presents XQBE through several examples and describes the main features of our implementation of the language, a visual editor coupled with an XQBE-to-XQuery translator. Indeed, the XQBE front-end is a general purpose user-friendly visual query interface, capable of providing access to any data storage system that exposes XQuery APIs. Available schema information can be exploited to guide users in querying data sets they are not familiar with. Also, switching between the visual and textual versions of the same query could be helpful for XQuery learners...|$|R

40|$|Utilizing negative-stain {{electron}} microscopy in which similar concentrations of reovirus types 1 and 3 are incubated with a carbon support film containing chick brain, rabbit brain, or HeLa cell microtubules, 81 % {{of the type}} 1 and 56 % of type 3 exhibited an association with the apparent "edge" of the microtubule. This implies {{that there is a}} high level of specific affinity for type 1 but not for type 3 to microtubules, since it has previously been determined that only 50 % of randomly associated particles would be associated with the edge. The high <b>edge</b> <b>binding</b> of reovirus type 1 is virtually independent of the origin of microtubule, or of whether microtubules or virus has been initially adhered to the support film. On the other hand, reovirus type 1 -specific antiserum reduced the <b>edge</b> <b>binding</b> or reovirus type 1 to 45 %, whereas type 3 specific antiserum caused no less (within the variability of the assay) of the <b>edge</b> <b>binding</b> of reovirus type 1 to microtubules (76 % edge bound). High <b>edge</b> <b>binding</b> of reovirus type 1 to microtubules is correlated with the presence of type 1 or sigma 1 polypeptide. This minor outer capsid polypeptide is encoded in the S 1 double-stranded RNA segment and is the viral hemagglutinin and neutralization antigen. Recombinant reovirus clones containing the S 1 double-stranded RNA segment of type 1 (80 and 802) show about 85 % <b>edge</b> <b>binding,</b> as compared to a value of 42 % for clones and the S 1 gene of type 3 (204. Electron microscopy of purified reovirus types 1 and 3 by negative staining reveals that type 1 and 802 capsomers are distinctly visualized, whereas those of type 3 and 204 appear diffuse. Thus, the greater in vitro binding of type 1 to microtubules may reflect an increased accessibility of certain of its outer capsomers, and thereby, sigma 1 polypeptides to microtubules. Examination of its outer sections of reovirus type 1 - and 3 -infected cells at 24 to 48 h postinfection at 31 degrees C showed that about eight times as many viral factoris in type 1 -infected cells exhibited an extensive association of virus particles with microtubules, as compared to viral factories of type 3 -infected cells. Thus, both in vivo and in vitro {{there appears to be a}} greater specificity for the association of reovirus type 1 particles with microtubules, as compared to reovirus type 3 particles...|$|R

40|$|Although path {{expressions}} in object-oriented query languages have materialized {{the capability}} of concisely manipulating the nested structures, their presence in query expressions require complex semantic considerations. However, none of currently existing visual query languages models such complex query expressions in a concise and intuitive way partly due to either the lackofwell-defined syntax and semantics of languages or improper representation of visual constructs for path expressions. In this paper, we present visual modeling of path expressions in a visual object-oriented database query language called Visual Object Query Language (VOQL) and proper modeling of the key features related to multi-valued path expressions. VOQL directly specifies the semantics of multi-valued path expressions by employing the visual notation capable of representing a set inclusion in addition to functional relationships. Specifically, the basic visual constructs called blobs, nested blobs, <b>binding</b> <b>edges,</b> and flattening edges are introduced. Blobs and nestedblobsare used to denote sets of objects that path expressions represent. Binding edges and flattening edges are designed to visually simulate the notion of variable binding {{and the notion of}} dot functions in path expressions. The grammar of these constructs defines the syntactic components suchasVOQL terms, VOQL formulas, and VOQL query expressions in a way as in tuple relational calculus. Their semantics are provided bysyntax directed translation to corresponding counterparts in Object-Oriented Predicate Calculus (OOPC). Also, in combination with a visual scoping box for universal quantification, the constructs allow explicit visual scoping and expressing the queries with nested quantification and recursion with [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Pictorial cues, {{together}} with motion and stereoscopic depth fields, {{can be used}} for perception and constitute ‘three kinds’ of vision. Edges in images are important features and can be created in either of these attributes. Are local edge and global shape detection processes attribute-specific? Three visual phenomena, believed to be due to low-level visual processes, were used as probes to address these issues. (1) Tilt illusions (misperceived orientation of a bar caused by an inducing grating) were used to investigate possible <b>binding</b> of <b>edges</b> across attributes. Double dissociation of tilt repulsion illusions (obtained with small orientation differences between inducer and bar) and attraction illusions (obtained with large orientation differences) suggest different mechanisms for their origins. Repulsion effects are believed to be due to processes in striate cortex and attraction because of higher level processing. The double dissociation was reproduced irrespective of the attributes used to create the inducing grating and the test-bar, suggesting that the detection and <b>binding</b> of <b>edges</b> across attributes take place in striate cortex. (2) Luminance-based illusory contour perception is another phenomenon believed to be mediated by processes in early visual cortical areas. Illusory contours can be cued by other attributes as well. Detection facilitation of a near-threshold luminous line occurred when it was superimposed on illusory contours irrespective of the attributes used as inducers. The result suggests attribute-independent activation of edge detectors, responding to real as well as illusory contours. (3) The performance in detecting snake-like shapes composed of aligned oriented elements embedded in randomly oriented noise elements was similar irrespective of the attributes used to create the elements. Performance when the attributes alternated along the path was superior to that predicted with an independent channel model. These results are discussed in terms of binding across attributes by feed-forward activation of orientation selective attribute-invariant cells (conjunction cells) in early stages of processing and contextual modulation and binding across visual space mediated by lateral and/or feedback signals from higher areas (dynamic binding) ...|$|R
