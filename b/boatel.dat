Captains Drive, {{originally}} a welcome center which featured gift shops, an Olympic-sized saltwater {{swimming pool and}} marina. The building was eventually turned into a restaurant called the [...] "Mystic Island Casino", which burned down in the 1970s, and opened in a new building on Mathistown Road, which still operates to this day. The original site is now home to condominiums, the residents of which have exclusive rights to use the former marina.|$|E
50|$|Punggol {{was also}} known for its sumptuous seafood and <b>boatels</b> that {{provided}} services like docking and renting of boats for boating, water skiing and skindiving lessons. These seafood restaurants and <b>boatels</b> have since been relocated in the mid-1990s to facilitate land reclamation works. Poultry and pig farms were also gradually phased out when redevelopment commenced in the 1970s. The last pig farm closed down in 1990. Land vacated by resettled farmers were then tendered out on short term leases for non-pollutive agricultural activities, which included hydroponic non-pollutive vegetable and orchid farms that used to flourish along the Cheng Lim Farmways and Buangkok Farmways. These farms existed along with old kampongs and low-rise residential areas. Most of these farms {{have given way to}} the high-rise HDB flats of Sengkang New Town and Punggol New Town.|$|R
