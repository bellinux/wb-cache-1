50|$|The {{formerly}} named <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>motmot</b> {{has been}} split into several species.|$|E
50|$|Noteworthy birds include <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>motmot,</b> yellow-eared parrot, Fuertes's parrot, rufous-fronted parakeet, Andean condor, brown-banded antpitta and ruddy duck. The bearded helmetcrest hummingbird is {{endemic to}} the region. Noteworthy mammals include the {{mountain}} tapir, spectacled bear, northern pudú, oncilla, cougar and white-eared opossum.|$|E
50|$|Protected species include white-necked hawk (Buteogallus lacernulatus), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), black-cheeked gnateater (Conopophaga melanops), rufous gnateater (Conopophaga lineata), buff-throated purpletuft (Iodopleura pipra), <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>motmot</b> (Momotus momota), {{scalloped}} antbird (Myrmeciza ruficauda), spot-winged wood quail (Odontophorus capueira), {{rusty-margined guan}} (Penelope superciliaris), golden-spangled piculet (Picumnus exilis), white-throated spadebill (Platyrinchus mystaceus) and plain xenops (Xenops minutus).|$|E
40|$|In wild birds, {{relatively}} {{little is known}} about intra- or interspecific variation in immunological capabilities, and even less is known about the effects of stress on immune function. Immunological assays adaptable to field settings and suitable {{for a wide variety of}} taxa will prove most useful for addressing these issues. We describe a novel application of an in vitro technique that measures the intrinsic bacteria-killing abilities of blood. We assessed the capacities of whole blood and plasma from free-living individuals of five tropical bird species to kill a nonpathogenic strain of E. coli before and after the birds experienced an acute stress. Killing invasive bacteria is a fundamental immune function, and the bacteria-killing assay measures constitutive, innate immunity integrated across circulating cell and protein components. Killing ability varied significantly across species, with common ground doves exhibiting the lowest levels and <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>motmots</b> exhibiting the highest levels. Across species, plasma killed bacteria as effectively as whole blood, and higher concentrations of plasma killed significantly better. One hour of acute stress reduced killing ability by up to 40 %. This assay is expected to be useful in evolutionary and ecological studies dealing with physiological and immunological differences in birds. ...|$|R
50|$|The blue-capped motmot or <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>motmot</b> (Momotus coeruliceps) is a {{colorful}} near-passerine bird found in forests and woodlands of eastern Mexico. This species and the Lesson's Motmot, Whooping Motmot, Trinidad Motmot, Amazonian Motmot, and Andean Motmot were all considered conspecific. The IUCN uses blue-crowned as their identifier for this species, however {{it was also}} the name used for the prior species complex.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2009 the Biological Reserve was a [...] "strict nature reserve" [...] under IUCN {{protected}} area category Ia, with a terrestrial area of 548 ha.Protected species include oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), the shrimp Atya scabra, {{and the birds}} Willis's antbird (Cercomacroides laeta), white-eyed foliage-gleaner (Automolus leucophthalmus), black-cheeked gnateater (Conopophaga melanops), rufous gnateater (Conopophaga lineata), <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>motmot</b> (Momotus momota), scalloped antbird (Myrmeciza ruficauda), great-billed hermit (phaethornis malaris), white-shouldered antshrike (Thamnophilus aethiops) and long-tailed woodnymph (Thalurania watertonii).|$|E
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{whether the}} tail wagging {{displayed in the}} family Momotidae serves as a signal directed towards predators to deter pursuit, as supported by previous research on the turquoise-browed motmot (Eumomota superciliosa). The <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>motmot</b> (Momotus momota) demonstrates several characteristics: territoriality, high site fidelity, impaired flight performance, and sedentary habits that could make the bird more vulnerable to prey-stalking and ambushing predators. Like other motmots, the <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>motmot</b> performs an exaggerated tail-wagging motion when presented with a potential predator. I studied the different reactions elicited by four treatments to examine if tail wagging was directed towards a predator that had been visually located by the displaying motmot. I presented either an avian predator or non-predator model or played back an avian call from a predator or a non-predator to motmots, and observed behaviors. Motmots {{were significantly more likely}} to wag-display (p = 0. 0009) upon seeing an ambush predator model (a perched bird of prey), more likely to not interrupt normal behavior like foraging when presented with a non-predatory control call, and subjects never approached either of the predator stimulus trials. Despite the more disturbed study site and niche differences between the <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>motmot</b> and the turquoise-browed motmot, my results in M. momota are consistent with, and corroborate, previous research on the latter species, suggesting that motmots may use the wag-display as a pursuit-deterrent signal to advertise awareness of the predator. In the <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>motmot,</b> because the visual signal of the wag-display draws attention to the bird, it is presumably more advantageous to signal to a predator that has been sighted rather than to a predator of uncertain location. Additionally, I observed captive motmots and noted an alternate tail display that was associated with more aggressive behavior...|$|E
