5|$|The Texas League, a {{baseball}} league, {{was founded in}} the 1800s, temporarily discontinued, and then restarted in the early 1900s evolving into a minor league. During the 1930s investors in Galveston, particularly Shearn Moody, established the Galveston Buccaneers baseball team, a successor to the former Galveston Pirates. The Buccaneers won the league championship in 1934 <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> was sold in 1937 after Moody's death. After the war, the new Gulf Coast League was established and the Galveston White Caps team was created. Galveston won the championship in 1953 <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> then faded and was disbanded in 1955 {{as the rest of}} Galveston's economy was collapsing.|$|E

5|$|After the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona {{signed the}} English top-scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> could not achieve success, as Schuster was {{excluded}} from the team. Terry Venables was subsequently fired {{at the beginning of}} the 1987–88 season and replaced with Luis Aragonés. The season finished with the players rebelling against president Núñez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1–0 victory at the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.|$|E
5|$|Andretti {{found little}} success after 1978 in Formula One– {{he failed to}} win another grand prix. He had a {{difficult}} year in 1979, as the new Lotus 80 was not competitive, and the team {{had to rely on}} the Lotus 79 which had been overtaken by the second generation of ground effect cars. In 1980, he was paired with the young Italian Elio de Angelis, and briefly with test driver Nigel Mansell, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> was again unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|Early exits in Europe {{continued}} as the decade progressed. Borussia Dortmund eliminated Celtic {{in the first}} round of the UEFA Cup in 1987, while Werder Bremen eliminated Celtic from the European Cup at the second round stage in 1988. In September 1989, Celtic's new Polish striker Dariusz Dziekanowski scored four goals at Parkhead in the second leg of a first round European Cup Winners Cup encounter with Partizan Belgrade, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> still went out of the competition under the away goals rule.|$|E
5|$|For 2009, Pierre Bruneau {{joined the}} team, {{and as a}} result, the team {{became known as the}} Bruichladdich-Bruneau Team, with the team {{continuing}} to use the AER-engined Radical SR9. The opening round of the season, which was the 1000km of Catalunya, saw Bruneau, partnered by Moseley and Nigel Greensall, finishing tenth overall, and fourth in the LM P2 category. At the 1000km of Spa, Tim Greaves and Jonathon Coleman replaced Moseley and Greensall, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> were disqualified from the event for an unspecified technical infringement. Rostan partnered Greaves and Bruneau at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, but retired from the race after just over fourteen and a half hours, having completed 91 laps. At the 1000 km of Algarve, Greaves and Bruneau were partnered by Francesco Sini, but could only finish 25th overall, and tenth in class. Michael Vergers replaced Greaves at the 1000km of Nürburgring, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> retired after 114 laps. Greaves returned for the 1000km of Silverstone, the season finale; the team finished 16th overall, and sixth in class. The team were classified seventh in the LM P2 standings, with eight points.|$|E
5|$|Graham {{announced}} in 1953 {{that the following}} season would be his last. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> won the championship in 1954 in a rematch against the Lions, and Brown convinced Graham to come back. Cleveland finished 1955 with a 9–2–1 record, reaching the championship game again. The Browns beat the Rams for their second straight championship, and Graham retired after the season.|$|E

5|$|In 1893, the Australian team {{stopped by}} Philadelphia {{on its way}} home from a tour of England.

5|$|In 1966, Ellis {{played for}} the Asheville Tourists of the Class AA Southern League, {{pitching}} to a 10–9 win–loss record, a 2.77 earned run average (ERA), and an All-Star Game appearance.

5|$|In the {{shortened}} 2011–12 NBA season, the Blazers {{got off to}} a 7–2 start. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> quickly {{began to}} collapse, as starting point guard Raymond Felton, among others, struggled with McMillan's new approach to a running-style offense. The team gained some notability as Aldridge was named to his first All-Star Game. Despite Aldridge's performance, {{the rest of the team}} became more inconsistent.|$|E
50|$|Thiry {{would finish}} {{the season with}} two more points than his more illustrious {{teammate}} Biasion, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>team's</b> combined performance would leave them third in the championship behind Japanese rivals, Toyota and Subaru.|$|R

5|$|Johnson was {{selected}} by the Detroit Lions {{in the first round}} as the second pick overall in the 2007 NFL Draft. This is the highest a Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket has ever been drafted.

The next day, the Detroit Tigers invited him to throw out the ceremonial first pitch.|$|E
5|$|Lighting and {{its effect}} on characters' skin was of {{particular}} importance to the Business Division 2 team, with a lot of work going into making sure shading and transparency fitted with each character's position in a scene in relation to its lighting. Previsualization was initially going to be done entirely in-house, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> eventually decided to bring in The Third Floor, an external company specializing in previsualization. The Third Floor ended up handling around 40% of the work. The animation was also supposed to be handled in-house using the V-Ray software, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> found it difficult to adapt the software to their needs. As Nozue wanted to use the experience and technology of Visual Works to create Kingsglaive, they decided to bring in experienced and dedicated outside help to handle V-Ray. This resulted in the cooperation with Digic Pictures, which included former staff from Square Enix's North American branch and were highly skilled in the creation of high-quality cutscenes. For procedural environmental elements such as falling rubble, they used the Houdini animation software.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma has {{teams in}} basketball, football, arena football, baseball, soccer, hockey, and wrestling in Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Enid, Norman, and Lawton. The Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association (NBA) is the state's only major league sports franchise.

5|$|On 3 May 2016, Müller had {{a penalty}} kick saved by Jan Oblak in the Champions League semi-final second leg {{at home to}} Atlético Madrid. The match ended in a 2–1 win for Bayern <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> was knocked out on the away goals rule.|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{experienced}} major offensive {{problems at}} the start of the season, resulting in the team's worst 17-game start in eight years. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> saw more success as the season progressed, including a seven-game road winning streak from November 28 to January 11, and a seven-game point streak from January 26 to February 15. The Bears participated in the 2013 AHL Outdoor Classic, but lost to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{game was}} prototyped {{in a single}} night, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> spent over half a year iterating through {{variations}} on the idea with visual themes such as sushi and chess.
