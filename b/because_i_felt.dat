The actor revealed to a BBC journalist that he had really wanted the part and was excited by the challenge of the character. Stevens became ill with tonsillitis during the shoot, and quipped that there are very few shots of him in full health still in the series.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Disney {{began to}} {{consider}} producing a sequel, {{but rather than}} using stop motion, Disney wanted to use computer animation. Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea. [...] "I was always very protective of Nightmare not to do sequels or things of that kind," [...] Burton explained. [...] "You know, 'Jack visits Thanksgiving world' or other kinds of things just <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the movie had a purity to it {{and the people that}} like it...

[...] The 2004 video game [...] did serve as a sequel of the film, with Capcom's crew of developers going after Burton for advice, and having the collaboration of the film's art director, Deane Taylor.

Both Gonzalez and Benigno gave it an [...] "A−", while Berk gave it all five stars. Berk also gave five stars to [...] "Songbird", which Gonzalez again gave an [...] "A−", while Benigno was slightly less generous with a [...] "B+". Futterman described Santana's vocals as [...] "raw and restrained", and called her rendition of the song a [...] "heartbreaking performance", but while Semigran called it [...] "sweet enough", she also wrote [...] "Rivera's voice doesn't pack quite the punch the tune requires". Kubicek, however, said it was [...] "easily the best song from the episode".|$|E

500|$|In 1999, {{after her}} {{marriage}} with Ajay Devgn, Kajol {{featured in a}} supporting role alongside him and Mahima Chaudhry in Prakash Jha's drama Dil Kya Kare. She played Nandita Rai, the other woman {{in the life of}} Anant Kishore, played by Devgn. In an interview with Filmfare she explained, [...] "The only reason, I agreed to play my character was because it had shades of grey. I would have probably refused the wife's role. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it had nothing for me to do." [...] Upon release, the film met with largely negative reviews. Critic Sharmila Taliculam, however, described Kajol as [...] "the only person who gives her role a semblance of sanity". Commercially too, the film failed to do well. However, her next release, Satish Kaushik's woman's film, the drama Hum Aapke Dil Mein Rehte Hain, emerged as a critical and commercial success. Starring alongside Anil Kapoor, Kajol received another Best Actress nomination at the Filmfare ceremony for her portrayal of Megha, the deceived wife of Kapoor's character. The film met with wide media coverage for being one of the few woman-centered films to emerge as a commercial success in India.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{began writing}} [...] "Fifteen" [...] with the lyric [...] "And Abigail gave {{everything}} she had to a boy/ Who changed his mind/ We both cried", which eventually became the song's bridge, and continued writing everything else in a backwards manner. The song was written about Swift's freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, where she met her best friend Abigail Anderson. [...] "I just decided I really wanted to tell that story about our first year of high school <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in my freshman year, I grew up more than any year in my life so far", Swift stated. The events it focused on were how both Swift and Anderson fell in love for the first time, but both suffered of heartbreaks. Aside from reminiscing on the events she and Anderson experienced, Swift wrote cautionary lyrics, intended to target teenage girls entering or already in their freshman year of high school. She described it as incorporating things she wished someone would have told her in a song when she was younger. [...] "The thing about high school, you don't know anything. You don't know anything, but you think you know everything", Swift said.|$|E

After the move was made official, head coach Ed DeChellis said, [...] "We are very excited to have Tim join our program. He is a very fast, quick player with tremendous speed in the backcourt and a good shooter. He possesses the kind of athleticism that Stanley Pringle does. He can get in the lane and find open guys and is a great drive and kick passer and he can score.

500|$|Dunglass {{had shown}} little {{interest}} in politics while at Eton or Oxford. He had not joined the Oxford Union as budding politicians usually did. However, as heir to the family estates he was doubtful {{about the prospect of}} life as a country gentleman: [...] "I was always rather discontented with this role and felt it wasn't going to be enough." [...] His biographer David Dutton believes that Dunglass became interested in politics because of the widespread unemployment and poverty in the Scottish lowlands where his family lived. Later in his career, when he had become Prime Minister, Dunglass (by then Sir Alec Douglas-Home) wrote in a memorandum: [...] "I went into politics <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that it was a form of public service and that as nearly a generation of politicians had been cut down in the first war those who had anything to give in the way of leadership ought to do so." [...] His political thinking was influenced by that of Noel Skelton, a member of the Unionist party (as the Conservatives were called in Scotland between 1912 and 1965). Skelton advocated [...] "a property-owning democracy", based on share-options for workers and industrial democracy. Dunglass was not persuaded by the socialist ideal of public ownership. He shared Skelton's view that [...] "what everybody owns nobody owns".|$|E
500|$|The {{dramatic}} {{feature film}} Rosewood (1997), directed by John Singleton, {{was based on}} these historic events. Minnie Lee Langley served {{as a source for}} the set designers, and Arnett Doctor was hired as a consultant. Recreated forms of the towns of Rosewood and Sumner were built in Central Florida, far away from Levy County. The film version, written by screenwriter Gregory Poirier, created a character named Mann, who enters Rosewood as a type of reluctant Western-style hero. Composites of historic figures were used as characters, and the film offers the possibility of a happy ending. E.R. Shipp in The New York Times suggests that Singleton's youth and his background in California contributed to his willingness to take on the story of Rosewood. She notes Singleton's rejection of the image of black people as victims and portrayal of [...] "an idyllic past in which black families are intact, loving and prosperous, and a black superhero who changes the course of history when he escapes the noose, takes on the mob with double-barreled ferocity and saves many women and children from death". Singleton has offered his view: [...] "I had a very deep—I wouldn't call it fear—but a deep contempt for the South <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that so much of the horror and evil that black people have faced in this country is rooted here... So in some ways this is my way of dealing with the whole thing." ...|$|E

After seeking psychological help, he experienced catharsis when he scored Spain's match-winning goal in the 2010 FIFA World Cup final, which he dedicated to Jarque by revealing the message [...] "Dani Jarque, always with us" [...] written on his undershirt.

The Bears then had three {{straight}} losses, including their sole home loss of the season. They were able to get four more wins, improving to a 7-5 mark following the first losing season in Tedford's tenure as head coach. This was Cal's third Holiday Bowl, the most recent being in 2006, and their prior record was 1-1. Coincidentally they had faced Texas teams in all of their Holiday Bowl matchups, with Texas Tech in 2004 and Texas A&M in 2006. Notably, the 2004 appearance resulted after Texas head coach Mack Brown had lobbied for an invitation to the Rose Bowl over Cal. Tedford said the incident [...] "was a long time ago. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> bad for our team <b>because</b> <b>I</b> really <b>felt</b> like we deserved to be in the Rose Bowl that year, but we're in 2011 now and it is a whole different situation."

His themes often reflected his social conscience and he was attracted by heroic acts committed by everyday people in the struggle to achieve dignity, freedom, and human rights.|$|R
