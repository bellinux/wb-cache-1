40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: The article {{explores the}} life and work of the Slovenian author Lojze Novak {{in order to get}} more {{recognition}} of the author in Slovenia. The article initially deals with the publishing activities of Argentina's diaspora. Methodology/approach : In order to create the bibliography the following bibliographic methods were used: searching and collecting the Novak´s works, bibliographic description as well as the arrangement of his opus. Novak´s works were obtained from Argentina, specifically from the Tine Debeljak legacy, Novak’s descendants, his contemporaries, friends and acquaintances, and from the National and University Library (NUK). Bibliographic descriptions are based on the primary documents therefore the data are accurate and verified. Bibliographic descriptions follow the Guidelines for the application of the ISBDs to the description of component parts (1998). Novak's personal bibliography includes 60 units arranged into published (52) and unpublished (8) works. Published works which consist of works of fiction (46) and nonfiction (6) are arranged chronologically by the publication year whereas within each year they are organised alphabetically. Novak´s <b>biobibliography</b> which includes 6 works and is arranged chronologically has also been produced through this process. Results: Since the author Lojze Novak has not won recognition in Slovenia yet, he has been introduced to our country by the personal bibliography and <b>biobibliography</b> that resulted from this research. Originality/practical implications: By doing the research into Novak´s opus eight of his unpublished works in manuscript form were discovered and included in his primary personal bibliography. It is therefore a comprehensive bibliography in the field. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLittle {{is known}} of George Campbell except for his 1728 paper on “impossible” roots of requations, which preceded one by Colin Maclaurin on the same subject. Maclaurin privately accused Campbell of plagiarism, which soon {{thereafter}} led to a public priority dispute. This paper discusses two mathematical works by Campbell which have not been previously reported: a manuscript volume of lecture notes, apparently from {{a time when he}} was a private tutor at the University of Edinburgh, and a published paper in which he produced a new result regarding complex roots of equations almost thirty years before its apparent rediscovery by Edward Waring.

40|$|An {{efficient}} and simple iterative synthesis {{has been successfully}} developed for systematically producing supramolecular extenders with multiple hydrogen-bonding sites at room temperature under catalyst-free condition. The novel strategy provided a rapid route to prepare the repeating units of amine extenders with precise chain lengths. The method was also characterized by the high yield and the ease of purifications with little by-products. The new dual functional building intermediate, 4 -(3, 3 -diethyl- 2, 4 -dioxoazetidin- 1 -yl) benzoyl chloride (DEDA-BC), was synthesized from readily available chemicals such as 4 -isocyanatobenzoyl chloride or p-tolyl isocyanate as the starting materials. In the iterative syntheses, the highly reactive acid chloride of DEDA-BC first reacted with aniline or 4, 4 '-MDA to form {{the first generation of}} azetidien- 2, 4 -dione intermediate. The latter was then reacted with 4 -(aminomethyl) benzenamine at the more selective azetidine- 2, 4 -dione group of DEDA-BC to form the first generation of amine extender with 4 -(aminomethyl) benzenamine at benzyl amine side. With this alternative method, the supramolecular extenders with various chain lengths (n = 1 to n = 3) were systematically prepared without tedious purification steps such as column chromatography. The mono- and di-amine extenders with repeating units from n = 1 to n = 3 were precisely synthesized via new iterative synthetic scheme. These prepared amine extenders had distinctive characteristics of multiple hydrogen bondings and narrow molecular-weight distributions. The molecular weights and hydrogen bonding sites of the prepared amine extenders increased at the fixed precise increments. Thus, the well-defined extenders were utilized in preparing polyurethanes for elucidating the structure-property relationships of the polyurethanes. The prepared extenders and the corresponding intermediates had high glass transition temperatures (well over 71 oC) and remarkable thermostabilities of some with the maxima of Td at 356 oC. The amine extenders were amorphous on DSC and WAXS analysis. Gelation tests were carried out within THF to study the association ability, and it was found that high generation of amine extenders could gel THF solution rapidly via hydrogen bonding interactions. These amine extenders underwent supramolecular assembling after gelation evident from their SAX analyses. Due to the precise chain-length extenders added, elastomeric polyurethanes prepared in this research had excellent thermostabilities of over 300 oC. The optimum molecular weights of extenders, confirmed by the mechanical tests, were 1188 -g/mol for the multiple-hydrogen-bonding-terminated polyurethanes and 928 -g/mol for the thermal plastic. The SAXS results revealed the morphology that there existed well-defined micro-domains in the multiple-hydrogen-bonding-terminated polyurethanes. The study presented a new ground for producing narrow-distribution extenders with variable chain lengths and to critically assess the structure-property relationships of hard-segment chain lengths for polyurethane materials.
