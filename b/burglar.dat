5|$|A {{number of}} burglaries by a cat <b>burglar</b> {{take place in}} Springfield, even {{striking}} the Simpsons' house. Among the stolen items include Lisa's saxophone, Marge's pearl necklace, Bart's stamp collection, and the handheld television. In response, the residents of Springfield arm themselves and install security devices. A neighborhood watch group is formed, and the members elect Homer as their leader. The group patrols the streets, but its members only end up violating laws further than catching criminals, turning into vigilantes. When Homer is interviewed on news anchor Kent Brockman's Smartline, the cat <b>burglar</b> calls the show and informs Homer that he will steal the world's largest cubic zirconia from the Springfield museum.|$|E
5|$|Across the Way is a 1915 American silent {{short film}} {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company under the Princess brand. The comedy-drama involves a man named Sparks playing a trick on his friend to make him question his sanity. The trick involves the friend's love interest being attacked by an assailant which works, but then a <b>burglar</b> attacks her a few days later. The friend saves his love interest from the <b>burglar</b> and later marries him instead of Sparks. The Princess comedy-dramas were not well-received {{and it was not}} long after the film's release that Edwin Thanhouser took a personal interest in the productions at the New Rochelle studio. Soon thereafter, the Princess brand was discontinued and replaced by the Falstaff brand. The film is presumed to be lost.|$|E
40|$|Burglary {{continues}} to yield low detection rates, {{and although the}} characteristics of how burglaries are committed has been investigated in some detail, less is known about how <b>burglars</b> avoid detection generally {{and in particular the}} activities of non-apprehended <b>burglars.</b> To investigate this issue, one can at least in principle investigate the special case of <b>burglars</b> who claim to have avoided apprehension {{in spite of the fact}} that they have committed a large number of burglaries over time. The approach taken here was to thematically analyze the interview data from a previous study comparing the crime scene movements of a small group of non-apprehended <b>burglars</b> with experienced but apprehended <b>burglars.</b> The results here from a thematic analysis of that previous study revealed marked differences in the rationales between the experienced, apprehended <b>burglars</b> and the experienced non-apprehended <b>burglars</b> when implementing different crime scene behaviors. A series of techniques and strategies emerges, which appear to aid in avoiding detection around the burglary scene and are summarized with implications discussed...|$|R
40|$|Not {{all those}} who commit {{burglary}} offenses do so {{for the same reasons}} – some are deliberate, planning their actions, while others are more impulsive. In new research on patterns of opportunism among <b>burglars,</b> Amber N. Sanders, Joseph B. Kuhns, and Kristie R. Blevins find that deliberate <b>burglars</b> are more motivated by money, while impulsive <b>burglars</b> were motivated by drugs and/or money. They suggest that <b>burglars</b> of both types may be dissuaded by crime prevention measures which might make their actions riskier...|$|R
40|$|In {{examining}} home {{addresses of}} <b>burglars</b> and the addresses of their targets, Jerry Ratcliffe found that <b>burglars</b> did not, as expected, {{work in their}} own neighbourhood. Most <b>burglars</b> (77 per cent) travelled away from their home suburb to do their work, travelling an average of five kilometres to their target. There {{was no evidence that}} physical boundaries separating suburbs, such as carriageways and parkland, acted as barriers inhibiting <b>burglars</b> 2 ̆ 7 movement. This has important implications for both urban design and crime prevention...|$|R
5|$|Homer and {{his group}} begin {{guarding}} the museum. Grampa and his friends from the retirement home volunteer to help, but Homer tells them to leave because they are too old. A few minutes later, Homer sees a group of teenagers drinking beer. He leaves his post to intervene and catch them, but immediately ends up getting drunk with them instead. While Homer's guard is down, the cat <b>burglar</b> sneaks past and steals the zirconia. Homer is blamed and pelted with vegetables by the unforgiving townspeople. Later that day, Grampa stops by the Simpsons' house and tells everybody that he knows who the cat <b>burglar</b> is: a resident in the local retirement home named Molloy.|$|E

Black and Bletcher review security camera footage of the crime, which leads to them discovering half a playing card—the Jack of Spades—at the scene.

5|$|Theodore Robert Bundy (born Theodore Robert Cowell; November 24, 1946– January 24, 1989) was an American serial killer, kidnapper, rapist, <b>burglar</b> and necrophile who {{assaulted}} {{and murdered}} numerous {{young women and}} girls during the 1970s, and possibly earlier. Shortly before his execution—after {{more than a decade}} of denials—he confessed to 30 homicides committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978.

5|$|Jealous of Kim's {{attraction}} to Edward, Jim suggests Edward pick {{the lock on}} his parents' home to obtain a van for Jim and Kim. Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock, a <b>burglar</b> alarm is triggered. Jim flees and Edward is arrested. The police determine that his period of isolation has left Edward without any sense of reality or common sense. Edward takes responsibility for the robbery, telling a surprised Kim he did it because she asked him to. Edward is shunned by the neighborhood except for the Boggs.|$|E
40|$|Car key {{burglary}} {{has recently}} {{become the focus}} of empirical investigation as offenders, no longer able to steal vehicles without first obtaining their keys, resort to "burgling" target properties. Research surrounding the modus operandi of these offenses is beginning to emerge; however, little {{attention has been paid to}} investigating the characteristics of car key burglary offenders. Challenging the assumption that car key burglary offenses are perpetrated by regular <b>burglars,</b> this study aims to differentiate between offenders. Logistic regression analysis of 110 car key and 110 regular burglary offenders revealed that car key <b>burglars</b> are more likely to have previous vehicle theft convictions and are also more likely to be detected on information supplied to the police than regular <b>burglars.</b> Regular <b>burglars</b> are more likely to have previous shoplifting convictions. It was concluded that car key <b>burglars</b> are a distinct sample of offenders and the implications of these findings are discussed. 10718...|$|R

40|$|Gaining the {{offender}} perspective {{is central to}} understanding domestic burglary, and is well documented. This article presents findings from 30 semi-structured interviews with convicted domestic <b>burglars</b> conducted in Greater Manchester, UK. The findings support the dominant supposition that domestic <b>burglars</b> operate within a bounded rationality, broadly calculating reward and risk in the commission of their offences. In addition, {{it was found that}} a sense of abstracted morality impacted on decision making. <b>Burglars</b> used cognitive ‘codes of practice’ which influenced target appraisal, shaped modus operandi, guided the search process and impacted on items stolen. The findings suggest that the role of neutralization techniques and morality should be (re) incorporated into the understanding of domestic <b>burglars</b> as rational offenders...|$|R

The Doctor studies the wormhole and determines that the bus protected them from its effects like a Faraday cage, and is too late from stopping the driver from stepping back through. When the driver's skeleton appears on Earth, UNIT forces are alerted, led by Captain Erisa Magambo and aided by scientific adviser Malcolm Taylor.|$|E

5|$|Bioluminescence {{has several}} {{functions}} in different taxa. Haddock et al. (2010) list as {{more or less}} definite functions in marine organisms the following: defensive functions of startle, counterillumination (camouflage), misdirection (smoke screen), distractive body parts, <b>burglar</b> alarm (making predators easier for higher predators to see), and warning to deter settlers; offensive functions of lure, stun or confuse prey, illuminate prey, and mate attraction/recognition. It is much easier for researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light than to analyse the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light serves. In some cases the function is unknown, as with species in three families of earthworm (Oligochaeta), such as Diplocardia longa where the coelomic fluid produces light when the animal moves. The following functions are reasonably well established in the named organisms.|$|E
