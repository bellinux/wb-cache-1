5|$|Aspects of Raonic's game {{which have}} been criticized include his return of serve, quickness and mobility, backhand, short game, {{and the use of}} <b>backspin</b> or sidespin. His above-average height—196cm (6ft 5in)—is linked to his strong serve, but is said to limit his {{movement}} around the court.|$|E
25|$|In cricket, {{a slider}} {{is a type}} of {{delivery}} bowled by a wrist spin bowler. Whereas a topspinner is released with the thumb facing the batsman, a slider is bowled in a similar manner to a legbreak, but instead of imparting sidespin with the third finger, the bowler allows his fingers to roll down the back of the ball, providing a mixture of sidespin and <b>backspin.</b> Whereas a topspinner tends to dip more quickly and bounce higher than a normal delivery, a slider does the opposite: it carries to a fuller length and bounces less than the batsman might expect. The sliders will typically head towards the batsman with a scrambled seam (with the ball not spinning {{in the direction of the}} seam, so the seam direction is not constant, unlike in conventional spin bowling). This has less effect on the flight and bounce but absence of leg spin may deceive the batsman. Frequently the slider is bowled with a mixture of side spin and <b>backspin.</b> This has the effect of making the ball harder to differentiate from the leg break for the batsmen without reducing the mechanical effects caused by the <b>backspin.</b> This delivery may skid straight on or it may turn a small amount.|$|E
25|$|Finger spin bowlers {{commonly}} bowl an exactly equivalent ball, {{which comes}} out of the front of the hand with <b>backspin</b> present. However the name slider has not passed over into common parlance for its offspin cousin, and the terms arm ball, backspinner or, more recently, teesra are used instead.|$|E

50|$|Back Spin - A spin on {{the upper}} back. The legs are often tucked into the chest and the move is often linked with windmills. The current record holder for most <b>backspins</b> is Bboy rhythm {{with a total of}} 52 spins.|$|R
25|$|By putting <b>backspin</b> on {{the ball}} the Magnus effect results in air {{travelling}} {{over the top of}} the ball quickly and cleanly whilst air travelling under the ball is turbulent. The lift produced means that the ball drops slower and travels further than a normal delivery. The slower descent also results in the ball bouncing lower.|$|E
25|$|If a ball is {{propelled}} {{forward with}} <b>backspin,</b> the translational and rotational friction will {{act in the}} same directions. The ball's angular velocity will be reduced after impact, as will its horizontal velocity, and the ball is propelled upwards, possibly even exceeding its original height. It is also possible for the ball to start spinning in the opposite direction, and even bounce backwards.|$|E
25|$|In sports like tennis or volleyball, {{the player}} {{can use the}} Magnus effect to control the ball's {{trajectory}} (e.g. via topspin or <b>backspin)</b> during flight. In golf, the effect is responsible for slicing and hooking which are usually a detriment to the golfer, but also helps with increasing the range of a drive and other shots. In baseball, pitchers use the effect to create curveballs and other special pitches.|$|E

40|$|Techniques for {{determining}} and correcting threaded part alignment using force and angular position data are developed to augment currently limited techniques for align- ing threaded parts. These new techniques {{are based on}} <b>backspinning</b> a nut {{with respect to a}} bolt and measuring the force change that occurs when the bolt "falls" into the nut. Kinematic models that describe the relationship between threaded parts during <b>backspinning</b> are introduced and are used to show how angular alignment may be determined. The models indicate how to distinguish between the aligned and misaligned cases of a bolt and a nut connection by using axial force data only. In addition, by tracking the in-plane relative attitude of the bolt during spinning, data can be obtained on the direction of the angular misalignment which, in turn, is used to correct the misalignment. Results from experiments using a bolt held in a specialized fixture and a three fingers Stanford/JPL hand are presented...|$|R
50|$|Beat juggling is {{the act of}} {{manipulating}} two or more samples (e.g. drum beats, or vocal phrases), {{in order}} to create a unique composition, using multiple turntables and one or more mixers. This can involve pauses, scratching, <b>backspins</b> and delays. It could be seen as fingertip sampling, and the turntable and mixer combination could be seen as an instrument from which sounds are made, from the sounds of other instruments (samples).|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the stock delivery, an arm ball is delivered with rolling the fingers {{down the back of}} the ball on release. This means the ball has <b>backspin</b> on it, and it does not turn appreciably off the pitch. Instead, it travels straight on {{in the direction of the}} arm, from which it derives its name. However, by keeping the seam upright, the bowler can also hope to obtain some outswing away from the right-handed batsman, thereby confusing the batsman who expects the ball to turn.|$|E
25|$|Table Tennis {{takes place}} at the Blade Center. Players are {{required}} to reach to their left or right to pick up a paddle before serving, and can then incorporate topspin, <b>backspin</b> and smash shots. Single player, local multiplayer and online multiplayer game modes are available. Table Tennis mini games include Paddle Panic, in which the player must take up a paddle in each hand and return as many balls as possible within a fixed time limit, and Rally Tally, where the player is challenged to maintain a single rally for as long as possible.|$|E
25|$|Two hands {{give the}} player more control, while one hand can {{generate}} a slice shot, applying <b>backspin</b> {{on the ball}} to produce a low trajectory bounce. Reach is also limited with the two-handed shot. The player long considered {{to have had the}} best backhand of all time, Don Budge, had a powerful one-handed stroke in the 1930s and 1940s that imparted topspin onto the ball. Ken Rosewall, another player noted for his one-handed backhand, used a very accurate slice backhand through the 1950s and 1960s. A small number of players, notably Monica Seles, use two hands on both the backhand and forehand sides.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of digital {{sampling}} and music editing on the computer, breakbeats have become much easier to create and use. Now, instead of cutting and splicing tape sections or constantly <b>backspinning</b> two records at the same time, a computer program {{can be used to}} cut, paste, and loop breakbeats endlessly. Digital effects like filters, reverb, reversing, time stretching and pitch shifting can be added to the beat, and even to individual sounds by themselves. Individual instruments from within a breakbeat can be sampled and combined with others, thereby creating wholly new breakbeat patterns.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} academic studies of turntablism (White 1996) argued for its designation as a legitimate electronic musical instrument—a manual analog sampler—and described turntable techniques such as <b>backspinning,</b> cutting, scratching and blending as basic tools for most hip hop DJs. White's study suggests the proficient hip-hop DJ must possess similar kinds of skills as those required by trained musicians, not limited {{to a sense of}} timing, hand-eye coordination, technical competence and musical creativity. By the year 2000, turntablism and turntablists had become widely publicized and accepted in the mainstream and within hip hop as valid artists. Through this recognition came further evolution.|$|R
25|$|DJ turntablism has {{origins in}} the {{invention}} of direct-drive turntables. Early belt-drive turntables were unsuitable for turntablism and mixing, since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear-and-tear and breakage, as the belt would break from <b>backspinning</b> or scratching. The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic), based in Osaka, Japan. It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests. In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable on the market, and the first in their influential Technics series of turntables.|$|R

Westwood attempted to follow him in close to the hole but got too much <b>backspin</b> on his pitch and the ball spun back into the water hazard. Westwood eventually chipped up from the drop zone and went on to make double bogey. Donald then holed his birdie putt to win the championship and in the process became the new world number one.|$|E

25|$|Typically, {{a player}} faces the basket {{with both feet}} facing the basket. A player will rest {{the ball on the}} {{fingertips}} of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand supporting the side of the ball. The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm. The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist fully bent, is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a follow-through. Players often try to put a steady <b>backspin</b> on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial, but generally a proper arc is recommended. Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.|$|E
50|$|In a {{direct-drive}} turntable {{the motor}} is located {{directly under the}} center of the platter and is connected to the platter directly. It is a significant advancement over older belt-drive turntables, which are unsuitable for turntablism, since they have a slow start-up time, and are prone to wear-and-tear and breakage, as the belt would break from <b>backspinning</b> or scratching. A direct-drive turntable eliminates belts, and instead employs a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests. This makes scratching possible, as the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggles the record {{back and forth on the}} platter.|$|R

25|$|The flipper is bowled on the {{opposite}} side to a slider, much {{in the same way that}} the top-spinner is bowled. On release, the bowler 'pinches' or clicks the thumb and forefinger, causing the ball to come out underneath the hand. There must be sufficient tension in the wrist and fingers to impart a good helping of <b>backspin</b> or underspin. In doing so the flipper will float on towards the batsman and land on a fuller length than he anticipated, often leaving him caught on the back foot when he wrongly assumes it to be a pullable or a cuttable ball. The back spin or underspin will cause the ball to hurry on at great pace with very little bounce, though this may be harder to achieve on softer wickets. A series of normal leg spinners or topspinners, with their dropping looping flight, will have the batsman used to the ball pitching on a shorter length. The batsman may wrongly assume that the flipper will drop and loop like a normal overspinning delivery, resulting in the ball pitching under the bat and going on to either hit the stumps or result in leg before wicket.|$|E
500|$|Bagwell's power hike piqued {{the curiosity}} of many {{baseball}} observers.

[...] With 15 HR {{in his first year}} in Houston, that average shrunk to 36.9. [...] He also exhibited extraordinary plate discipline for a rookie: while ranking tenth in the league in walks with 75, his OBP placed fifth at [...]387. [...] Of the power surge, commented Bagwell to hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo, [...] "That's awesome", to which he reacted, [...] "Awesome? [...] We can get more out of you than that." [...] By altering an approach to contact the pitch with topspin as he did when he arriving to Houston, Jaramillo taught Bagwell to hit with <b>backspin,</b> resulting in a soaring trajectory rather than nose diving. [...] He also habituated Bagwell to manipulate the count, waiting for a pitch to drive instead of indiscriminately swinging at any pitch that appeared to be a strike. [...] Accounted Bagwell of the newfound advantage, [...] "I didn’t hit many home runs in the minor leagues, but when I hit one, when I got <b>backspin</b> on it, it went a long way." ...|$|E

Early belt-drive turntables were unsuitable for turntablism, since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear-and-tear and breakage, as the belt would break from <b>backspinning</b> or scratching. In 1972, Technics started making their SL-1200 turntable, which became the most popular turntable for DJs due to its high torque direct-drive design. Hip hop DJs began using the Technics SL-1200s as musical instruments to manipulate records with turntablism techniques such as scratching and beat juggling rather than merely mixing records. In 1975, hip-hop DJ Grand Wizard Theodore invented the scratching technique by accident. He developed the technique while experimenting with a Technics SL-1200 turntable, finding that its direct-drive motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record {{back and forth on}} the platter. Although Technics stopped producing the SL-1200 in 2010, they remain the most popular DJ turntable due to their high build quality and durability. The SL-1200 evolved into the SL-1200 MK2 in 1979—which, as of the early-2010s, remains an industry standard for DJing.|$|R

In two experiments, one group of participants was instructed to focus on their movement pattern, i. e., <b>backspins</b> and racket-ball contact point (internal focus of attention), while the other group was instructed to focus on the effect of their movements, i. e., the arc of the ball and landing point (external focus of attention). Experiment 1 showed that the external focus condition produced higher accuracy scores in acquisition, retention, and transfer. In Experiment 2, movement form was evaluated in addition to the accuracy of the shots. We also examined the effects of attentional focus on individuals that were determined to be field-independent versus individuals that were field-dependent. The external focus participants again demonstrated more effective learning with regard to movement accuracy than the internal focus participants. Furthermore, movement form was similar for both groups indicating that the benefits of an external attentional focus were not achieved at the expense of movement form. These results extend previous findings showing learning advantages of focusing on the movement effects rather than the movements themselves (e. g., Wulf, Hoss, & Prinz, 1998) by demonstrating that corresponding instructions can have a significant influence on the learning of complex sport skills.
