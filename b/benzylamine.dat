40|$|Structure−activity {{correlations}} {{have been}} employed previously in the mechanistic interpretation of TTQ-dependent amine dehydrogenases using {{a series of}} para-substituted <b>benzylamines.</b> However, by combining the use of kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) and crystallographic analysis, in conjunction with structure−reactivity correlation studies, we show that para-substituted <b>benzylamines</b> are poor reactivity probes for TTQ-dependent aromatic amine dehydrogenase (AADH). Stopped-flow kinetic studies of the reductive half-reaction, with para-substituted <b>benzylamines</b> and their dideuterated counterparts, demonstrate that C−H or C−D bond breakage is not fully rate limiting (KIEs ∼ unity). Contrary to previous reports, Hammett plots exhibit a poor correlation of structure−reactivity data with electronic substituent effects for para-substituted <b>benzylamines</b> and phenylethylamines. Crystallographic studies of enzyme−substrate complexes reveal that the observed structure−reactivity correlations are not attributed to distinct binding modes for para-substituted <b>benzylamines</b> in the active site, although two binding sites for p-nitrobenzylamine are identified. We identify structural rearrangements, prior to the H-transfer step, which are likely to limit the rate of TTQ reduction by <b>benzylamines.</b> This work emphasizes (i) the need for caution when applying structure−activity correlations to enzyme-catalyzed reactions and (ii) {{the added benefit of}} using both isotope effects and structural analysis, in conjunction with structure−reactivity relationships, to study chemical steps in enzyme reaction cycles...|$|R
40|$|Para-substituted <b>benzylamines</b> {{are poor}} {{reactivity}} probes for structure-reactivity studies with TTQ-dependent aromatic amine dehydrogenase (AADH). In this study, we combine kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) with structure-reactivity studies {{to show that}} para-substituted <b>benzylamines</b> are good reactivity probes of TTQ mechanism with the isolated TTQ-containing subunit of AADH. Contrary to the TTQ-containing subunit of methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH), which is catalytically inactive, the small subunit of AADH catalyzes the oxidative deamination {{of a variety of}} amine substrates. Observed rate constants are second order with respect to substrate and inhibitor (phenylhydrazine) concentration. Kinetic studies with para-substituted <b>benzylamines</b> and their dideuterated counterparts reveal KIEs (> 6) larger than those observed with native AADH (KIEs approximately unity). This is attributed to formation of the benzylamine-derived iminoquinone requiring structural rearrangement of the benzyl side chain in the active site of the native enzyme. This structural reorganization requires motions from the side chains of adjacent residues (which are absent in the isolated small subunit). The position of Phealpha 97 in particular is responsible for the conformational gating (and hence deflated KIEs) observed with para-substituted <b>benzylamines</b> in the native enzyme. Hammett plots for the small subunit exhibit a strong correlation of structure-reactivity data with electronic substituent effects for para-substituted <b>benzylamines</b> and phenethylamines, unlike native AADH for which a poor correlation is observed. TTQ reduction in the isolated subunit is enhanced by electron withdrawing substituents, contrary to structure-reactivity studies reported for synthetic TTQ model compounds in which rate constants are enhanced by electron donating substituents. We infer that para-substituted <b>benzylamines</b> are good reactivity probes of TTQ mechanism with the isolated small subunit. This is attributed to the absence of structural rearrangement prior to H-transfer that limits the rate of TTQ reduction by para-substituted <b>benzylamines</b> in native enzyme. 1136...|$|R
