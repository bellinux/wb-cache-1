40|$|Music has a {{very unique}} and special place in everyone's life. The pleasurable sound is nothing but the proper {{arrangement}} of tones harmonic with each other. Making a musical instrument is therefore difficult and challenging work. This paper purely contends {{with the idea that}} a simple musical instrument like <b>bell</b> <b>plate</b> reaches to the hands of a commoner, making the design process simple and economical. This focused on attaining some simple music accustoming bell plates. For this purpose some methods of physics of vibration were used and nodal patterns were analyzed. The FEM software SolidWorks Simulation™ was used to simulate the vibration modes. Using sound analysis software sound spectrum was viewed to find fundamental pitch. Bell plates were tuned to desired pitch and finally melody of 'Jingle-bells' was played on bell plates successfully...|$|E

50|$|<b>Bell</b> <b>plates</b> can {{be played}} while {{suspended}} from a stand or while held in one hand of the performer depending {{of the number of}} different plates needed for a specific performance. If only one plate is needed, then the performer will simply hold that specific plate with one hand and strike it with the other. This plate can be kept on a table covered with a towel or carpet square while not being played. If the performance requires several plates to be played in succession, then the plates should be suspended from a stand. The player then strikes the plates with a wooden, hard plastic, or metal mallet which can be covered in varying thicknesses of felt to create a variety of sounds. A softer mallet, which has a thicker felt covering, can achieve a greater sounding of the fundamental pitch of the plate, while a harder mallet with a thinner covering of felt will produce stronger overtones and possibly overshadow the fundamental pitch of the plate. The sound can also be manipulated by striking different areas of the plate. Greater volume can be achieved by striking the center of the lower or upper third of the instrument, and a clearer pitch can be produced by striking the plate at the center or near the bottom edge. The <b>Bell</b> <b>Plates</b> may be dampened with the player's hand or with the mallet to quicken or immediately cut off the decay of the sound after striking.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Bell</b> <b>plates</b> are {{polygonal}} plates which, when held in {{the hand}} and struck with a beater, produce an initial transient followed by a sustained, pure tone. The presence of the sustained tone depends sensitively on the shape. This paper addresses the question: why does a particular shape ring so well, while slightly different shapes do not? We show that, in the standard ringing shape, the nodal lines {{of one of the}} lowest modes of vibration fuse in the handle to produce a region that exerts neither vibrational force nor torque on the hand, and therefore does not transfer vibrational energy to the hand. 1...|$|R

40|$|This article {{deals with}} applied emblems found in open Vilnius churches, {{decorated}} in the 16 th– 18 th centuries. There are twenty–seven decorative emblems {{placed on the}} ceilings and arches of the churches. The verbal part of these emblems, called inscriptio or lemma, {{is the object of}} the article. In the 16 th century when European literature was enriched with a new genre of emblem, the artists and craftsmen began to use these emblems as a decorative element in their works such as jewelry, armours, carpets, <b>bells,</b> <b>plates,</b> furniture etc. The same phenomenon is seen in the decoration of Vilnius churches. Our research proved that people who worked out the idea of the decoration of the church used two sources for decorative emblems – the Bible (a short quotation from the Bible was used as an inscription) and well-known literary emblems. Speaking about the latter source, some decorative emblems are exact copies of the works of famous 16 th century writers, where inscription, icon and concept are taken without any changes. Others show variations on popular literary emblems of that time. Modifications could appear both in verbal and in visual part, thus entirely changing the idea of the emblem...|$|R
