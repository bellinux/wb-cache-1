40|$|In a bolted joint, it {{is known}} that {{failures}} usually happen {{at the root of the}} first <b>bolt</b> <b>thread</b> where the maximum stress concentration occurs. Previously several methods were proposed to reduce the stress concentration through improving bolts and nuts profile. Among those methods, tapering threads have been widely used in mechanical structures. Those types of threads are called CD bolts, which were proposed by Nishida as an effective method for stress reduction. Several experimental studies indicated that CD bolts have higher fatigue strength although little FEM analyses is available. In this study, therefore, the bolted joint with tapered threads is analyzed with the finite element method, and stress reduction effect of CD bolts is discussed with varying geometrical conditions. The reduction of the stress concentration is realized by tapering <b>bolt</b> <b>thread.</b> Then, it is found that the stress reduction is notable when the height of bolt threads is reduced significantly near the bolt heat and the nut is closer to the bolt head. According to those results, optimum conditions for stress reduction are discussed. Then, it is shown that the maximum stress can be decreased by 20 % compared with the cases of standard bolts and nuts...|$|E

40|$|Following STS- 107, the External Tank (ET) Project {{implemented}} {{corrective actions}} and configuration {{changes at the}} ET bipod fitting. Among the corrective actions, the existing bolt lock wire which provided resistance to potential bolt rotation was removed. The lock wire removal was because of concerns with creating voids during foam application and potential for lock wire to become debris. The bolts had been previously lubricated to facilitate assembly but, because of elimination of the lock wire, the ET Project wanted to enable the locking feature of the insert. Thus, the lubrication was removed from <b>bolt</b> <b>threads</b> and instead applied to the washer under the bolt head. Lubrication is necessary to maximize joint pre-load while remaining within the bolt torque specification. The locking feature is implemented by thread crimping in at four places in the insert.

Here, we consider that the nut pitch is a few microns larger than the bolt pitch. Fatigue experiments are conducted for three kinds of specimens with different levels of pitch differences. The obtained S-N curves show that the fatigue life is extended to about 1. 5 times by introducing a suitable pitch difference. According to the detailed investigation on the fractured specimens, it is found that the fractured positions and the crack configuration are totally different depending on the pitch difference.

A total of 100 coupons (for 20 batches of five) were immersed in distilled water for three and six months at a constant temperature of 40 °C. Subsequently, they were load tested using stainless steel ‘pins’ of M 10 and M 20 sizes with material orientations of 0 o, 45 o and 90 o to the direction of pultrusion. Furthermore, this test series considered the effect of loading with and without <b>bolt</b> <b>thread</b> in the bearing zone. Testing employed a non-standard set-up that accommodates smaller test coupons, allowing material to be sourced from the web and flange of a 254 × 254 × 9. 53 mm wide flange shape.

40|$|Fine {{screw threads}} {{are widely used}} for the bolted joints under severe running conditions. It {{is well known that}} they are {{effective}} to prevent thread loosening due to fine pitch. As for other mechanical characteristics, it has been reported in the previous paper using complex stress functions that the stress concentration at <b>bolt</b> <b>thread</b> root is higher than coarse screw threads and the fatigue strength of threaded fasteners shows a minimum value for varying pitch. However, the latter is questionable since the calculations were conducted under lots of hypotheses. In this study, stress concentration and stress amplitude along thread root are evaluated by three-dimensional finite element analysis, in which numerical models of the bolted joints are constructed so as to accurately represent the effect of thread helical geometry. It is shown that the stress concentration at thread root of fine screw threads is higher than that of coarse screw threads, and the maximum stress amplitude is likely to be lower on the contrary. Meanwhile, it is sometimes recognized that clamping forces of fine screw threads are smaller comparing to those of coarse screw threads when tightened with same torque. To clarify this contradictory phenomenon, tightening experiments are conducted, and it is found that the difference of the energy needed for tightening screw threads is found to be the major cause. 1...|$|E
50|$|In normal use, a nut-and-bolt joint holds {{together}} because the bolt {{is under a}} constant tensile stress called the preload. The preload pulls the nut <b>threads</b> against the <b>bolt</b> <b>threads,</b> and the nut face against the bearing surface, with a constant force, so that the nut cannot rotate without overcoming the friction between these surfaces. If the joint is subjected to vibration, however, the preload increases and decreases with each cycle of movement. If the minimum preload during the vibration cycle {{is not enough to}} hold the nut firmly in contact with the bolt and the bearing surface, then the nut is likely to become loose.|$|R
50|$|Typical {{drilling}} and milling operations, {{as well as}} manufacturing practices for <b>bolt</b> <b>threads,</b> introduce mechanical play proportional {{to the size of}} the fasteners. For example, bolts up to 10 mm in diameter typically have play on the order of 0.2 mm. When dowels are used in addition to bolts, however, the tighter dimensional tolerances of dowels and their mating holes—typically 0.01 mm—result in significantly less play, on the order of 0.02 mm. Manufacturing costs are inversely proportional to mechanical tolerances and, as a result, engineers must balance the need for mechanical precision against cost as well as other factors such as manufacturability and serviceability.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behaviour}} of bolted steel connections subjected to tension. Quasi-static conditions have been considered. By performing laboratory tests on single bolts and simple T-stub connections the failure modes of the bolts have been examined. Finite element models are created and validated to represent the behaviour observed in the laboratory. Different grip length configurations have been tested for a single bolt and nut assembly subjected to pure tension. Both partially and fully <b>threaded</b> <b>bolts</b> have been considered. It was found that partially <b>threaded</b> <b>bolts</b> with three <b>threads</b> between the unthreaded part of the shank and the bearing surface of the nut experienced thread stripping. This is inconsistent with the recommendations given in NS-EN 1090 - 2, which states that one full thread is sufficient to avoid thread stripping. Finite element models are able to recreate the behaviour of all configurations tested with acceptable accuracy. In addition to the grip length, the material properties and geometry of the threads are identified as the crucial factors for the failure modes of the bolts. Simple T-stub connections with one bolt in each flange have been tested to examine the behaviour of the bolts when they are subjected {{to a combination of}} tension and bending. The center distance between the bolts was varied to examine the behaviour when subjected to increased bending effects. Connections with partially <b>threaded</b> <b>bolts</b> all failed due to thread stripping. The fully <b>threaded</b> <b>bolts</b> experienced both <b>thread</b> stripping and <b>bolt</b> failure. The complexity of the stress distribution when large bending effects are present was difficult to recreate with a simplified finite element model.

Four {{of these models}} had modifications to the threads at the load bearing end of the nut. These modifications included tapered truncation of the thread crests and taper of the whole thread form {{for a portion of}} the nut length. The maximum stress in the bolt always occurred within one pitch of the load bearing face of the nut. Truncating threads increased the maximum bolt stresses. Tapering the whole thread form reduced the maximum stress and produced a more uniform load distribution in the bolt. The conditions at the load bearing face of the nut were found to influence the load distribution in the <b>bolt</b> <b>threads</b> more than the stress concentrations in the bolt. ...|$|R
