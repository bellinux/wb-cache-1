5|$|In February 2008, Barkley {{announced}} that he would be running for Governor of Alabama in 2014 as an Independent. On October 27, 2008, he officially announced his candidacy for Governor of Alabama in an interview with CNN, stating that he planned to run in the 2014 election cycle, but he began to <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> idea in a November 24, 2009 interview on The Jay Leno Show. In 2010, he confirmed that he was not running in 2014. In 2016, Barkley once more turned Republican, when he endorsed John Kasich for the office of President in the 2016 election.|$|E
5|$|The {{first chance}} {{of the match}} was for Borussia; Rainer Bonhof saw his shot come <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> post. In the 24th minute, Borussia player Herbert Wimmer {{suffered}} an injury {{and had to be}} replaced by Christian Kulik. Three minutes later Ian Callaghan won the ball in midfield and passed to Steve Heighway on the right wing. Heighway cut inside from a wing and passed into space for Terry McDermott who scored the opening goal of the match. Borussia began to exert more of an influence on the game after Liverpool's goal, however they were unable to equalise {{before the end of the}} first half.|$|E
5|$|Low {{challenged}} the Prime Minister over the Suez issue, {{accusing him of}} sending a threatening telegram that caused British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> invasion and so gave the Soviets {{the opportunity for a}} military buildup in Egypt. St. Laurent angrily denied the charge and offered to open his correspondence to any of the fifty privy councillors who could then announce whether St. Laurent was telling the truth. Low took St. Laurent up on his challenge, and selected the only living former Prime Minister, Tory Arthur Meighen, but the matter was not resolved before the election, and Meighen was not called upon to examine the correspondence in the election's aftermath.|$|E

25|$|Ellerbe <b>backed</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> plan in late December 2012. Ellerbe {{altered the}} plan so that five rather than zero {{advanced}} life support ambulances would remain on duty between 1:00 A.M. and 7:00 A.M.|$|R
5|$|Responding to the Japanese {{capture of}} part of the ridgeline, Major Odell M. Conoley—Hanneken's {{battalion}} executive officer—quickly gathered a counterattack unit of 17 men, including communications specialists, messmen, a cook, and a bandsman. Conoley's scratch force was joined by elements of Hanneken's Company G, Company C, and a few unwounded survivors from Company F and attacked the Japanese before they could consolidate their positions {{on top of the}} ridge. By 06:00, Conoley's force had pushed the Japanese <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ridge, effectively ending Oka's attack. The Marines counted 98 Japanese bodies on the ridge and 200 more in the ravine in front of it. Hanneken's unit suffered 14 killed and 32 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The Australians on 400 Plateau had {{for some}} time been {{subjected}} to sniping and artillery fire and could see Turkish troops digging in on Gun Ridge. Around 13:00 a column of Turkish reinforcements from the 27th Infantry Regiment, in at least battalion strength, were observed moving along the ridge-line from the south. The Turks then turned towards 400 Plateau and advanced in extended order. The Turkish counter-attack soon forced the advanced Australian troops to withdraw, and their machine-gun fire caused them heavy casualties. It {{was not long before}} the attack had forced a wedge between the Australians on Baby 700 and those on 400 Plateau. The heavy Turkish fire onto Lone Pine forced the survivors to withdraw back to the western slope of 400 Plateau. At 14:25 Turkish artillery and small arms fire was so heavy that the Indian artillerymen were forced to push their guns <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> plateau by hand, and they reformed on the beach.|$|E
5|$|United {{then went}} back downfield and Ronaldo took on Lauren, who dared not dive in for a tackle and risk a second yellow card. Ronaldo got past the Cameroonian full-back and then chipped a cross into the penalty area, but Van Nistelrooy was unable to make enough contact with the ball to force his header on target. A minute later, Silvestre found Rooney with another {{diagonal}} pass; Rooney attempted to drive in a low cross, but it ended up heading towards goal and came <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> foot of the post. Fletcher was first to the ball but he fired a shot {{across the face of}} the goal and out for a goal kick. With their very next attack, United sent Ronaldo away down the left wing again; he sent over another cross, but it was again too far in front of Van Nistelrooy.|$|E

50|$|Monongahela and Kineo were {{next in the}} column, and, also {{blinded by}} smoke, ran aground on the western shore. The impact {{separated}} the two ships. <b>The</b> stress of <b>backing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> shore disabled Monongahelas engine, and a thirty-two-pounder (14.5 kg) round shot split Kineos rudder post, disabling her steering. Both ships drifted downriver.|$|R
5|$|The first Allied {{landings}} on {{the beach}} occurred on 9 September, with two regiments of Middleton's 45th Infantry Division, the 157th and 179th Infantry, landing the following day. The other regiment of the division, the 180th, would land at a different point and be held in reserve by Clark. Middleton was responsible for ten miles of beachhead between the British X Corps and the U.S. 36th Infantry Division. The German defensive positions pounded the Allies, who gained little ground {{in the first few}} days of the operation. Lieutenant General Clark, the Fifth Army commander, faltered and sent around a confidential memo indicating that he was contemplating taking the troops <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> beaches. Middleton, telling his staff that they were not leaving, spread around the word to his troops that it was a good time to do some hard fighting. On the morning of 14 September units of the Forty-fifth did some particularly hard fighting at a large tobacco factory, consisting of five imposing stone buildings in a somewhat circular pattern. The Germans were dug in here, and repulsed the Americans initially, but with the aid of some naval gun fire, the Germans were eventually pushed back. Clark visited the front later that day, and was convinced that his army was going to stay.|$|E
5|$|The German team {{started the}} second half in a more {{positive}} mood with Jancker forcing a save from Schmeichel in the first minute of the restart. Basler was proving to be Bayern's most dangerous player, first firing a 30-yard shot towards goal and then setting up a header for Markus Babbel, who missed the ball entirely. United put together an attack when, after a healthy period of possession, Giggs sent in a cross towards Jesper Blomqvist who could only knock the ball over the bar after a desperate stretch. Another chance for Basler prompted Alex Ferguson to bring on striker Teddy Sheringham. Ottmar Hitzfeld responded with a substitution of his own, bringing on Mehmet Scholl, who immediately set up Stefan Effenberg for a long-range shot which went narrowly wide. Schmeichel kept his side in the game when tipping another Effenberg shot over the bar after 75 minutes. Scholl then almost scored from a delicate 20-yard chip after a run from Basler, but the ball bounced <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> post and {{into the arms of}} a relieved Schmeichel. With the game seemingly drifting away from the English side, Ferguson introduced striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær with 10 minutes remaining. The substitute immediately forced Kahn into a diving save with a header; it was the closest United had come to scoring all game. A minute later, Bayern missed a chance to secure the trophy when an overhead kick from Jancker came off the crossbar. As the game crept into the last five minutes, United's two substitutes forced Kahn into more saves, firstly through a Sheringham volley and then from another Solskjær header.|$|E
25|$|Then, as Hmong probes {{tested for}} {{weaknesses}} in PAVN Group 766's defenses, the weather went bad. Two days of cloudy weather stifled air {{support for the}} Hmong. Then, as flying weather improved and air support once again increased, on 18 December the Hmong renewed their attack up Phou Pha Thi. As they reached the top, they ran into a heavy machine gun that drove them <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> summit.|$|E

50|$|In {{the fall}} of 2014, Richman moved down to the bantamweight division. He debuted at 135 against Ed West at Bellator 126 on September 26, 2014.

He also made his signature 'walk-off knockout', where he <b>backs</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> fighter before referee called stoppage on the fight.|$|R
5|$|Captain Salmond rushed on {{deck and}} ordered the anchor to be dropped, the quarter-boats to be lowered, and a turn astern to be given by the engines. However, as <b>the</b> ship <b>backed</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> rock, the sea rushed into the large hole made by the {{collision}} and the ship struck again, buckling the plates of the forward bilge and ripping open the bulkheads. Shortly, the forward compartments and the engine rooms were flooded, and over 100 soldiers were drowned in their berths.|$|R
25|$|On September 1, {{his first}} day <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> DL, Sweeney pinch-hit {{in the bottom of}} the 9th and hit a bloop base hit that broke up Minnesota Twins {{starting}} pitcher Scott Baker's no-hitter. Baker had gone eight perfect innings before he walked Royals catcher John Buck at the beginning of the ninth. With two outs to go, Royals manager Buddy Bell pinch-hit Sweeney for Tony Peña Jr. and Sweeney ended the no-hitter.|$|E
25|$|On 12 August 1952, McDermut {{once again}} joined U.N. naval forces off the Korean coast, {{reporting}} to the bombardment group in the Wonsan-Songjin-Yang-do area on the 13 August. In mid-September she steamed to Japan for escort and plane guard duty with carriers conducting training exercises, followed by duty with the Taiwan patrol. By 26 December she was <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> east coast of Korea for flight operations screening duty with TF77. On 29 January 1953 she departed for San Diego, arriving 16 February.|$|E
25|$|In partial {{suspension}} {{the person}} is bound {{in a way that}} part of their body weight is held by suspension ropes, cables or chains.

A person lying on their upper back with legs tied upwards to a suspension point to pull their lower <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground would also qualify as partial suspension.|$|E
25|$|There was a sandbar at {{the mouth}} of the Wood River, and the steamer used its paddle wheel to wash out the sand to create a channel deep enough to allow the steamer to pass. This took 24hours, and the sand washed away {{accumulated}} under the hull of the boat, so that the vessel could not move forward <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> bar. In <b>backing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bar, the hull became permanently hogged, that is, flexed so that the middle part of the boat was raised and the bow and the stern drooped lower into the water.|$|R

25|$|Home ported at Sasebo, Japan this {{landing ship}} {{spent much of}} her time {{unloading}} supplies, especially cement, along the central coast of South Vietnam. In February 1967, new orders directed the ship to Pusan, South Korea. There she decommissioned on 27 February, and was turned over to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) in whose service she continued to sail during 1969. On 13 January 1970, while <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Vietnamese coast, she was damaged by an underwater explosion. She was subsequently towed to Da Nang for repairs.|$|E

25|$|The {{colleges with}} the most players {{selected}} in the draft were Florida, Miami and Tennessee which each had eight players chosen. Meanwhile, Penn State and Miami each had four student-athletes selected in the first round. Eleven defensive linemen were selected in round one, eclipsing the previous record of nine, set in 2001. Ten underclassmen were taken in the first round, including three of the first four overall selections. The first round lasted nearly five hours. The Buffalo Bills selection of Miami's Willis McGahee as the first running <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> board was notable because he was recovering from a career-threatening injury he suffered in the Fiesta Bowl which it was believed could have caused him to miss the upcoming season.|$|E

25|$|After an {{extensive}} shakedown cruise – which included operations off Mexico, in Hawaiian waters, off Washington and British Columbia, and a voyage to the Panama Canal Zone — the cruiser {{returned to the}} Mare Island Navy Yard. Gunnery installation and conversion to a flagship took her into 1935. In February, she joined Cruiser Division 6 (Crudiv 6) at San Diego. In May, she moved north and participated in Fleet Problem XVI, then returned to southern California. A few weeks later, she was <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> northwest coast for fleet tactics, and in July, she steamed farther north to Alaska. In August, she returned to California and, {{through the end of}} 1938, San Francisco continued to range the eastern Pacific, cruising from the state of Washington to Peru and from California to Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|The return {{game against}} was played {{a week later}} on 17 March 2016 at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium. Defender Adil Rami opened the scoring as he stooped to head a José Antonio Reyes corner in off the post. The match then slipped out of Basel's reach inside two minutes {{at the end of}} the first half. Reyes danced through the Basel defence and his low cross gave Kévin Gameiro an easy finish from close range. A minute later, Michael Krohn-Dehli {{advanced}} with a quick run and was the provider of the cross that found Gameiro. The striker's header came <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> underside of the crossbar and bounced in off his leg to make it 3–0 at half-time. Basel showed only small signs of a fightback. Luca Zuffi's effort from 25 yards out was still rising as it flew over the crossbar. Breel Embolo missed two chances late in the game as the Swiss side were dumped out of the competition. The result extended Sevilla's run of Europa League home wins to 11 – the longest in the competition's history and put a dent in Basel's impressive away record in Europe this season.|$|E
25|$|As Phoenix sprawled north, {{developers}} found {{plenty of}} available land on Central Avenue and began {{capitalizing on the}} cachet of the youthful city's signature boulevard. Local steakhouse legend Durant's (2611 N) opened in 1950 and has changed little other than that patrons today enter the restaurant through the <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> parking lot as celebrities and other socialites once did back then. Park Central Mall (3110 N) replaced a dairy farm in the middle part of the decade, signaling the beginning of downtown's long decline as retail stores and malls opened {{away from the city}} center. America's second McDonald's restaurant was built near Indian School Road in 1953. It was the first McDonald's franchise, the first to feature the Golden Arches, and served as a model for Ray Kroc's Illinois store. These early commercial developments foreshadowed the trend towards autocentrism on Central Avenue and indeed the rest of the city. The first major high-rise built on Central Avenue outside of downtown was the Phoenix Towers (2201 N), erected in 1957. The Phoenix Art Museum moved to Central Avenue in 1959. Phoenix fully annexed Sunnyslope, at Central's north terminus, that year. Central Avenue to its southern terminus, South Mountain, where minorities had been historically redlined, was annexed a year later.|$|E
