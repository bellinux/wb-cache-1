25|$|The crowd {{began to}} attack Black {{areas of the}} city, moving to the Levee (Seventh and Washington), a {{predominantly}} <b>Black</b> <b>business</b> area. It included dives and saloons {{as well as some}} official businesses. First, the mob attacked the pawnshop of John Olberman, who was Jewish, and stole guns and ammunition. Then, they destroyed a total of 35 other Black-owned businesses, and shattered windows and storefronts all along Washington Street. Among the businesses destroyed were saloons owned by two <b>Black</b> <b>business</b> and political leaders, one an active Republican and the other a Democrat. Three White men were shot in the conflict, allegedly by Blacks defending their businesses on Washington Street.

Otherwise, about half of the reported casualties were from gunfire and about a quarter from bricks hurled into the crowd.|$|E
