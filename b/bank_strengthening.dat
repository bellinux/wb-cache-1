A diversification of Asian central bank reserves from dollar into euro would weaken the dollar against both other currencies. Thus, such a di-versification would be incompatible with Asian currency pegs.

40|$|Unfortunately, Japan has had {{first-hand}} experience to confirm thatan inflation accommodating policy assists self-deterioration in an economy. Unlike previous contributions, {{we find that}} the Bank of Japan waspoorly committed to inflation stabilization for our full sample period of 1979 - 97. Although the Bank had aggressively stabilized inflation duringthe period of Governor Maekawa(1979 - 84), it accommodated inflationin a short-sighted manner and emphasized output control after 1985. In particular, we identify that the <b>Bank</b> <b>strengthened</b> its accommodativepolicy stance during the bubble period(1987 - 89) and thedeflation period(1993 - 97). We present empirical evidence that suchan accommodative policy regime could be a sustainable force of theboom-bust cycle in the late 1980 s and the successive persistent deflation. We believe that the experience of the Bank of Japan has importantimplications for other contemporary central banks. 野村芳正先生退職記念...|$|R

40|$|First {{established}} {{during the}} 1830 's, the Enskilda banks {{were characterized by}} unlimited liability {{and the right to}} issue bank notes.

This paper utilizes new data to revise this picture. Instead of diminishing in importance due to the possibility to establish limited liability banks the Enskilda <b>banks</b> <b>strengthened</b> their position due to the often overlooked Enskilda Banking Act of 1864. This Banking Act permitted freer establishment and automatic prolongation of the charters for such banks. The note issuance was of importance to overcome shortages of liquidity due to both seasonal and regional variations in demand. The Enskilda banks made an important contribution to the development of liquid capital markets and for economic growth also after 1864...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} informational content of {{unconventional}} monetary policies {{and its effect}} on commodity markets, adopting a nonlinear approach for modeling volatility. The main question addressed is how the Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and European Central Bank's (ECB's) announcements concerning monetary easing affect two major commodities: gold and silver. Our empirical evidence based on daily and high-frequency data suggests that relevant information causes ambiguous valuation adjustments as well as stabilization or destabilization effects. Specifically, there is strong evidence that the Japanese Central <b>Bank</b> <b>strengthens</b> the precious metal markets by increasing their returns and by causing stabilization effects, in contrast to the ECB, which has opposite results, mainly due to the heterogeneous expectations of investors within these markets. These asymmetries across central banks' effects on gold and silver risk–return profile imply that the ECB unconventional monetary easing informational content opposes its stated mission, adding uncertainty in precious metals markets...|$|R

50|$|Around year 2005 <b>banks</b> <b>strengthened</b> {{their routine}} to issue {{identity}} cards, so only near relatives verifiable by the banks, in reality only parents or adult children, could guarantee {{the identity of}} some who had no valid identity document. This other person needed a valid Swedish identity document. The reason was the existence of identity fraud, and that banks had to pay compensation to people affected. The cashier service owned by the postal service followed this rule in 2007. There was no law about these rules or saying that banks or the cashier service had to issue these cards. As a consequence, everyone {{who did not have}} any Swedish parent or adult child could not get an identity document. Swedish citizens could get a passport, but not citizens of other countries resident in Sweden. In e.g. Norway and Denmark, immigrants could get a bank id card based on the residence permit and foreign passport, but not in Sweden, since no rule regulated it and the Swedish Migration Board did also not want to guarantee the identity.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{theory of}} {{financial}} intermediation highlights various channels through which capital and liquidity are interrelated. Using a simultaneous equations framework, we investigate {{the relationship between}} bank regulatory capital and bank liquidity measured from on-balance sheet positions for European and U. S. publicly traded commercial banks. Previous research studying the determinants of bank capital buffer has neglected the role of liquidity. On the whole, we find that banks decrease their regulatory capital ratios when they face higher illiquidity as defined in the Basel III accords or when they create more liquidity as measured by Berger and Bouwman (2009). However, considering other measures of illiquidity that focus more closely on core deposits in the United States, our results show that small <b>banks</b> <b>strengthen</b> their solvency standards when {{they are exposed to}} higher illiquidity. Our empirical investigation supports the need to implement minimum liquidity ratios concomitant to capital ratios, as stressed by the Basel Committee; however, our findings also shed light on the need to further clarify how to define and measure illiquidity and also on how to regulate large banking institutions, which behave differently than smaller ones...|$|R
