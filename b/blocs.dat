5|$|The terms First World, Second World, and Third World were {{originally}} used {{to divide the}} world's nations into three categories. The model did not emerge to its end state all at once. The complete overthrow of the pre–World War II status quo, known as the Cold War, left two superpowers (the United States and the Soviet Union) vying for ultimate global supremacy. They created two camps, known as <b>blocs.</b> These <b>blocs</b> {{formed the basis of}} the concepts of the First and Second Worlds.|$|E

50|$|However, it {{was with}} the <b>Bloc</b> Québécois that women {{candidates}} had the highest chance of winning: nearly three quarters of female <b>Bloc</b> candidates were elected. (As the <b>Bloc</b> runs candidates only in Quebec, the election of 50 <b>Bloc</b> MPs meant that any <b>Bloc</b> candidate had a 66.6% chance of winning.) 26.6% of female MPs are Bloquistes, while the <b>Bloc</b> holds only 16.2% of the seats.|$|R
50|$|The Hope and Labour <b>Bloc</b> (كتلة الأمل والعمل) was a {{candidature}} {{list that}} contested the May 2005 municipal elections in Bethlehem, the West Bank.

5|$|As {{is common}} in Northern Ireland, most of the schools in Lurgan are {{attended}} mainly by children from one or other of the two main ethno-religious <b>blocs,</b> reflecting the existence of deep-seated ethnic, sectarian and political divisions in society. Some schools are in the Catholic 'maintained' sector, i.e. maintained by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, and others are controlled directly by the state. Directly-controlled state schools generally have a predominantly Protestant intake.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the 1960s and 1970s, Cold War {{participants}} struggled to adjust to a new, more complicated pattern of international relations in which the world was no longer divided into two clearly opposed <b>blocs.</b> From the beginning of the post-war period, Western Europe and Japan rapidly recovered from the destruction of World War II and sustained strong economic growth through the 1950s and 1960s, with per capita GDPs approaching those of the United States, while Eastern Bloc economies stagnated.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} comprises three subdivisions: Suri Sadar, Bolpur and Rampurhat. Suri is {{the district}} headquarters.

50|$|Tamil Nadu Forward <b>Bloc</b> was a {{political}} party in Tamil Nadu, India. The party was founded in 1981 through the merger of National Forward <b>Bloc</b> and Pasumpon Forward <b>Bloc.</b> by C. Ayyanan Ambalam, following a split from the National Forward <b>Bloc</b> (NFB).|$|R

5|$|Assemblies and councils {{operated}} {{according to}} established procedures {{overseen by the}} augurs. They could only be convened by magistrates, and citizens only voted on matters proposed by the presiding magistrate. Over the years, laws were passed which mandated a written ballot, attempted to reduce voter intimidation, and established procedures to watch over voting and prevent voter fraud. For elections, {{it was not a}} matter of who received the most votes, but rather who could first be approved by a majority of the voting <b>blocs.</b> All votes had to be completed within a single day and had to be done again if interrupted or abandoned.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of December 3, 2006, Chick-fil-A Bowl representatives {{selected}} Virginia Tech to represent the ACC in the 2006Chick-fil-A Bowl.

Two days after the selections were announced, the game was declared sold out, the 10th consecutive sellout in the combined history of the Peach and Chick-fil-A Bowls. Georgia and Virginia Tech each were assigned initial allocations of 18,500tickets for distribution, and following the quick sales of those ticket <b>blocs,</b> each asked for and received additional tickets to distribute.|$|E
5|$|The James Bond {{character}} and related media have triggered {{a number of}} criticisms and reactions across the political spectrum, and are still highly debated in popular culture studies. Some observers accuse Bond novels and films of misogyny and sexism. Geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in {{the dynamics of the}} Cold War, with power struggles among <b>blocs</b> playing out in the peripheral areas. Other critics claim that 21st century Bond movies reflect imperial nostalgia. American conservative critics, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s, saw Bond as a nihilistic, hedonistic, and amoral character that challenged family values.|$|E

5|$|The border was a {{physical}} manifestation of Winston Churchill's metaphorical Iron Curtain {{that separated the}} Soviet and Western <b>blocs</b> during the Cold War. It marked the boundary between two ideological systems– capitalism and communism. Built by East Germany in phases from 1952 to the late 1980s, the fortifications were constructed to stop the large-scale emigration of East German citizens to the West, about 1,000 of whom {{are said to have}} died trying to cross it during its 45-year existence. It caused widespread economic and social disruption on both sides; East Germans living in the region suffered especially draconian restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The early republican {{constitution}} {{was dominated by}} the patricians, who monopolised all control of the magistracies, the Senate, and the voting <b>blocs</b> of the assemblies. Generally, it slowly developed with a tendency towards greater popular representation {{at the expense of}} the patrician class. The main historical sources for the origins of the Roman political system, Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, relied heavily on the Roman annalists, who supplemented what little written history existed with oral history. This lack of evidence poses problems for the reliability of the traditional account of the republic's origins.|$|E
5|$|Patton's opponent, Republican Larry Forgy, {{hurt his}} {{campaign}} by aligning {{himself with the}} Christian right, alienating moderates in both parties, particularly in Louisville. He also openly opposed the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA), passed in 1990 during the administration of Wallace G. Wilkinson. Republican supporters of education reform deserted his campaign and helped form a bi-partisan coalition supporting KERA. Traditional Democratic voting <b>blocs</b> such as organized labor and African-Americans turned out in force for Patton. To further undermine Forgy, Patton reminded voters of the budget cuts by Congressional Republicans to programs affecting the elderly. These issues ultimately delivered a Patton victory of 500,787votes to 479,227. It was the closest Kentucky gubernatorial election in 32years, and {{marked the first time}} an eastern Kentuckian had won the governorship since Bert T. Combs in 1959.|$|E

5|$|The Diet was {{initially}} dominated by Polish nobles, but in time, it saw {{the emergence of}} a strong peasant faction. Another notable change over time included {{the emergence of a}} Ruthenian (modern Ukrainian) bloc, changing the balance of power within the body. Overall, the Diet preserved the Polish parliamentary tradition during a time in which it waned in the Prussian Partition and the Russian Partition, and saw the emergence of the major political parties and groupings that were to dominate the political life of the Second Polish Republic after World War I. The leader of the Polish peasant movement in the Second Polish Republic, Wincenty Witos, gained his experience in the Diet, elected {{for the first time in}} 1908. Similarly, the National Democrats, and the Polish socialists, had their political <b>blocs</b> in the diet around that time.|$|E
5|$|Uruguay had a {{very low}} {{population}} density and a weak government. Ordinary citizens were compelled by circumstances to seek the protection of local caudillos—landlords who were either Colorados or Blancos and who used their workers, mostly gaucho horsemen, as private armies. The civil wars between the two factions were brutal. Harsh tactics produced ever-increasing alienation between the groups, and included seizure of land, confiscation of livestock and executions. The antagonism caused by atrocities, along with family loyalties and political ties, made reconciliation unthinkable. European immigrants, who came in great numbers during {{the latter half of}} the nineteenth century, were drawn into one party or the other; both parties had liberal and conservative wings, so the social and political views of newcomers could be reconciled with either. The feuding <b>blocs</b> impeded development of a broadly supported central national administration.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{the world}} {{split into two}} large geopolitical <b>blocs,</b> {{separating}} into spheres of communism and capitalism. This led to the Cold War, during which the term First World was often used because of its political, social, and economic relevance. The term itself was first introduced in the late 1940s by the United Nations. Today, the First World is slightly outdated and has no official definition, however, it is generally {{thought of as the}} capitalist, industrial, wealthy and developed countries. This definition includes Australia & New Zealand, the developed countries of Asia (South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore) and the wealthy countries of North America and Europe, particularly Western Europe. In contemporary society, the First World is viewed as countries that have the most advanced economies, the greatest influence, the highest standards of living, and the greatest technology. After the Cold War, these countries of the First World included member states of NATO, U.S.-aligned states, neutral countries that were developed and industrialized, and the former British Colonies that were considered developed. It can be defined succinctly as Europe, plus the richer countries of the former British Empire (USA, Canada, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand), Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.|$|E

5|$|Tensions {{between the}} EEU and the European Union (EU) {{occurred}} as both {{have sought to}} deepen their ties with several former Soviet republics. The EU has signed free trade agreements with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. However, separatists in all three countries back closer ties with Russia. Russia and the EU both pressured Ukraine to join their respective economic <b>blocs</b> {{to the exclusion of}} the other, which ultimately led to Ukraine being torn in two, with the EU supporting the unwilling departure of the elected president, and Russia then annexing the Crimean peninsula (following a referendum) and supporting separatists in Eastern Ukraine. In response, some member states of the European Union have sought to find alternatives to Russian gas, while others have voiced their support for the construction of the South Stream pipeline which circumvents Ukraine. Later the already started construction of the pipeline, under US sanctions on Russia and pressure on EU, the project was abandoned. Analysts believe Russia backs the Eurasian Economic Union in order to limit western influence in the region.|$|E
