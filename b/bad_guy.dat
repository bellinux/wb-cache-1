25|$|Chad Michael Murray was {{the first}} person to be cast for One Tree Hill. The {{producers}} were originally unsure as to who Murray would play. Series creator Mark Schwahn wanted him to play the character of Nathan Scott since Murray had played a <b>bad</b> <b>guy</b> several times before, and he felt it was only natural to give him this role. Murray, however, wanted to portray Lucas due to a connection he felt with the character. He felt that he could inhabit the character as the two share several similarities. Murray's mother left him when he was young, and Lucas was abandoned by his father. Murray's passion for the role led the producers to cast him as Lucas. Murray had turned down the lead role of Ryan Atwood in The O.C. to accept the role as Lucas Scott.|$|E

25|$|Self-important, romantic, {{and nearly}} always wrong, Barney dreamed {{of the day}} he could use the one bullet Andy had issued to him, though he did fire his gun on a few occasions. He always fired his pistol accidentally while still in his holster or in the ceiling of the court house, at which point he would sadly hand his pistol to Andy. This is why Barney kept his one very shiny bullet in his shirt pocket. In episode #196, Andy gave Barney more bullets so that he would have a loaded gun to go after a <b>bad</b> <b>guy</b> that Barney unintentionally helped escape. While Barney was forever {{frustrated}} that Mayberry was too small for the delusional ideas he had of himself, viewers got the sense that he couldn't have survived anywhere else. Don Knotts played the comic and pathetic sides of the character with equal aplomb and he received three Emmy Awards during the show's first five seasons.|$|E
25|$|After the UWA closed {{he began}} working for Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA, later known as Lucha Libre AAA World Wide).

25|$|However, {{he later}} {{wrote in his}} report that he blamed Pakistan's poor {{performance}} in the matches on player Shahid Afridi. Younis submitted the report to the PCB where it was somehow leaked to the media. He expressed his anger {{and said that the}} report was confidential – it caused fans, on social media sites, to express disappointment in him to see him shifting the blame onto Afridi. Younis, in the report, accused Afridi of being 'non-serious' during the matches and said Mohammad Hafeez hid his knee injury as well, which also affected their performance. He also said Afridi either performed poorly himself, or that other players did not listen to him as a captain. Regarding the report, he said the PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board) were painting him as the <b>bad</b> <b>guy</b> and skipped meeting with him regarding the issue later on as it is most likely that they leaked the report. He then also scrapped plans of retirement and said he wanted to focus on the leak, despite his contract as coach ending in June 2016.|$|E

25|$|In late 2005 Konnan {{returned}} to AAA, bringing {{a contingent of}} Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) wrestlers with him, forming La Legión Extranjera, the new top Rudo (Heel or <b>bad</b> <b>guy)</b> faction of AAA. The appearance of La Legión actually caused La Parka and Cibernético to form a temporary alliance, fighting La Legión in the main event of Guerra de Titanes 2004, defeating Konnan and Rikishi. The Cibernético / La Parka alliance {{did not last long}} as Cibernético formed La Secta Cibernetica in early 2005, siding with Konnan's La Legión. On March 11, 2005 La Parka won his third Rey de Reyes, winning a seven-way elimination match over Latin Lover, Abismo Negro, Chessman, Jeff Jarrett, Konnan and Cibernético. With the victory La Parka became the only wrestler to ever win three Rey de Reyes tournaments. La Parka's run as the top tecnico of AAA continued, main eventing Triplemania XIII alongside Latin Lover and Octagón, defeating Cibernético, Chessman and Fuerza Guerrera. In early 2006 La Secta de Cibernetica brought in Muerta Cibernetica to strengthen the group, often replacing Cibernético because of various minor injuries. At the 2006 Rey de Reyes La Parka, Vampiro and Octagón represented AAA in a four way trios match against La Secta, Team TNA and Los Guapos for the Rey de Reyes trophy. While La Parka did not win he did help his teammate Vampiro win it. At Triplemania XIV La Parka faced off against Muerta Cibernetica in a Luchas de Apuesta. In a move that mirrored Triplemania XII La Parka won, unmasking Muerta Cibernetica. The Legión Extranjera storyline saw La Parka face off against TNA wrestlers such as Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Elix Skipper and Hotstuff Hernandez.|$|E
