50|$|In {{architecture}} {{the term}} is frequently used to denote any boxed in beam or other downstand from a ceiling and by extension even the vertical downstand face of an area of lower ceiling beyond. This usage presumably derives from experience on boats where to maintain the structural function personnel openings through bulkheads always retain {{a portion of the}} <b>bulkhead</b> <b>crossing</b> the head of the opening. Head strikes on these downstand elements are commonplace hence in architecture any overhead downstand element comes to be referred to as a bulkhead.|$|E
5000|$|... 1897,Cleveland [...] "The Capricornian" [...] 18 May 1897. The {{suction dredge}} {{to the order}} of Messrs. Brand and Drybrough, of Townsville. The hull is of steel, 80 ft. long, 26 ft. abeam, and 3 ft. deep, with steel deck and both {{longitudinal}} and <b>cross</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> dividing the craft into a number of compartments, and giving great strength.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{cause of}} bulk carrier loss is ingress of sea water owing to {{cracks in the}} side shell {{as a consequence of}} main frame deterioration and the subsequent failure of transverse bulkheads adjacent to the flooded hold. When the hold is flooded the stresses in the bulkhead are known to exceed yield and the bulkhead to have undergone slight distortion. The vertical bulkheads are corrugated and have upper support from cross deck strips. Typical initial damages are cracks in the joint between bulkhead corrugations and deck plating due partly to corrosion. These can lead to portions of the cross deck strip becoming detached from the bulkhead. Pressure on the ship sides can then cause the <b>bulkhead</b> and <b>cross</b> deck strip to buckle, with minor and local buckles on the bulkhead leading to shear buckling of the whole structure. The purpose of the Study Group will be an investigation of this cracking and buckling process...|$|R
60|$|He led Jimmy into a {{handsome}} teak deckhouse between the masts, {{and opened a}} door into the owner’s cabin, which occupied the full width of the house. Two electric lamps were burning, rich curtains were drawn across the windows to shut out the foggy light, and a fire burned cheerfully in an open-fronted stove, encased in decorated tiles. Its pipe was of polished brass; {{the walls and the}} ceiling were enameled a spotless white, with the moldings of the beams picked out in harmonious color; two good marine pictures hung on the <b>cross</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> The place struck Jimmy as being strangely luxurious after the cramped, damp cabin of the sloop; but he soon forgot his surroundings when his eyes rested on the figure lying in the corner-berth.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{automotive}} industry, {{thin walled}} beam {{is widely used}} to build vehicles structure. Vehicle structure is built by joining thin walled beams using various welding techniques. The usage of thin walled structure in automotive is important to improve vehicle performance by offering better strength-to-weight ratio. However the application of thin walled structure will cause few drawbacks to vehicle structure. When thin walled beam or structure is loaded with compression load, at certain limit it will undergo local or global buckling. Another problem is when thin walled beam is joined to other thin walled beams, it will show unexpected deformation which called joint flexibility. Both phenomena will cause numerical and analytical model to predict stiffness of structure tend to deviate from experimental result. In vehicle structure fabrication 3 D space frame is used a lot. As a case study for this application, area around car <b>bulkhead</b> where <b>cross</b> member, side sill and A pillar are connected to each other at right angle is studied. The intention of this research work is to produce validated finite element model to predict equivalent stiffness of 3 D space frame structural joint. Finite element, shell element is most common technique used to model the joined structure. However {{it is known that}} shell model cannot produce good result. In this result work, modelling of equivalent stiffness for 3 D space frame structural joint is presented. The result shows, using this model the accuracy is about 65 %. New modelling technique is proposed to increase the accuracy based on solid model. By introducing circular beam elements at welding area, it is found that accuracy improves up to 90 %...|$|R
