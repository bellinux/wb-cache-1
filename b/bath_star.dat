50|$|The rank {{badge of}} a chief {{inspector}} is three <b>Bath</b> <b>stars</b> ("pips") worn on the epaulettes. This {{is the same}} badge as a captain in the British Army. Until 1953, chief inspectors in the Metropolitan Police wore a crown on their epaulettes instead.|$|R

50|$|The rank badge worn by a DCC {{consists}} of a <b>bath</b> <b>star</b> ("pip") over crossed tipstaves within a wreath, similar to the insignia of a major-general in the British Army.|$|E
5000|$|The epaulettes of uniformed inspectors, {{unlike those}} of constables and sergeants, {{do not show}} a divisional or {{personal}} identification number. Instead they feature Order of the <b>Bath</b> <b>stars,</b> informally known as [...] "pips", being the same insignia as those of a lieutenant in the British Army.|$|R
5000|$|Rank was {{indicated}} {{by a number}} of diamond-shaped <b>Bath</b> <b>Stars</b> (or [...] "pips") that were worn on either the standing collar or the epaulettes. A single star was worn from 1880 to 1922, two stars from 1922 to 1941, and three stars from 1941 to 1949.|$|R
50|$|Principal {{officer is}} a rank used in HM Prison Service, the Scottish Prison Service and the Northern Ireland Prison Service, {{as well as}} other prison {{services}} around the world. It is the highest uniformed rank, above senior officer and below the grades of governor. A principal officer traditionally headed each wing of a prison. Their rank badge is two <b>Bath</b> <b>stars</b> ("pips") on each epaulette.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: John Smyth {{features}} {{in this group}} portrait of the Dilettanti Society. The others are: Sir William Hamilton, Stephen Payne-Gallwey, Walter Spencer-Stanhope, Sir John Taylor, Bart., Richard Thompson and Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn. Hamilton (centre, with his Order of the <b>Bath</b> <b>star</b> visible) is showing the vase to Smyth on the right.|$|E
50|$|Senior {{officer is}} a rank used in HM Prison Service, the Scottish Prison Service and the Northern Ireland Prison Service, {{as well as}} other prison {{services}} around the world. It is senior to an ordinary prison officer, but junior to a principal officer. Senior officers traditionally headed shifts in each wing of a prison. Their rank badge is a single <b>Bath</b> <b>star</b> ("pip") on each epaulette.|$|E
50|$|The rank badge, worn on the epaulettes, is a <b>bath</b> <b>star</b> ("pip") below a crown, {{the same}} rank badge worn by a {{lieutenant-colonel}} in the British Army. Metropolitan Police chief superintendents wore a crown over two stars until {{the abolition of}} the rank of superintendent grade I in 1974, when they changed to the latter's rank badge, which was already worn by chief superintendents elsewhere in the country.|$|E
50|$|Epaulettes of the {{military}} branch were gold throughout with silver devices, while those of the civil branches had a silver edging and gold devices. Instead of the baton and sword or foul anchor, civil branch epaulettes substituted a star. Navigating branch epaulettes {{were the same as}} {{the military}} branch, but with crossed plain anchors in place of the foul anchor. The epaulette stars had eight points, quite unlike the Order of the <b>Bath</b> <b>stars</b> worn by army officers.|$|R
50|$|In Australia, {{commander}} is a rank {{used by the}} Victorian, Tasmanian, Western Australian, South Australian, and Australian Federal police forces. The insignia {{consists of}} a crown over three <b>bath</b> <b>stars</b> in a triangular formation, equivalent to a brigadier in the army. In all four forces, it is junior {{to the rank of}} assistant commissioner, and senior to the rank of chief superintendent, with the exception of Western Australia and Victoria where it is senior to the rank of superintendent.|$|R
5000|$|The rank of admiral {{itself is}} shown in its sleeve lace by a broad band with three {{narrower}} bands. Since the mid-1990s, the insignia of a Royal Australian Navy admiral is the crown of St. Edward above a crossed sword and baton, above four silver stars, above the word AUSTRALIA. [...] Note that unlike other Commonwealth countries, the sword is a naval cutlass, with a closed handle. The stars have eight points, like the Royal Navy insignia and unlike the four pointed Order of the <b>Bath</b> <b>stars</b> used by the army.|$|R
50|$|The rank {{of second}} {{lieutenant}} (2Lt; colloquially {{known as a}} one-pip) was introduced throughout the British Army in 1877 to replace the short-lived rank of sub-lieutenant, although it had long {{been used in the}} Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, Fusilier and Rifle regiments. At first the rank bore no distinct insignia. In 1902, a single <b>Bath</b> <b>star</b> (now commonly referred to as a pip) was introduced; the ranks of lieutenant and captain had their number of stars increased by one to (respectively) two and three. The rank is also used by the Royal Marines.|$|E
5000|$|Until 26 January 1950, when India {{became a}} republic, the Indian Army {{utilised}} the British-pattern rank badges of the British Indian Army. Upon independence in 1947, India became a dominion within the British Commonwealth of Nations, {{but the old}} rank insignia, incorporating the Tudor Crown and four-pointed <b>Bath</b> <b>Star</b> ("pip"), was retained, as George VI remained Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Armed Forces. After 26 January 1950, when India became a republic, the President of India became Commander-in-Chief, and the Ashoka Lion replaced the crown, with a five-pointed star being substituted for the [...] "pip." ...|$|E
50|$|The DMP was {{modelled}} {{closely on}} London's Metropolitan Police. Not {{only were the}} uniforms of the two forces almost indistinguishable, especially after the helmet and <b>Bath</b> <b>Star</b> were adopted, but the two forces also had a similar organisational structure; rather than a Chief Constable, they were commanded by a Commissioner, {{who was not a}} police officer, but a magistrate holding a Commission of the Peace. This was descended from the 18th century system of controlling parish constables, and was a sop to the public's fears about the danger of a standing police force under government control.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, a chief {{superintendent}} is senior {{to the rank}} of superintendent in all the Australian police forces excepting the Western Australia Police, where the rank of assistant commissioner is used in the place of {{chief superintendent}}; it is junior {{to the rank of}} commander (Victoria Police, South Australia Police) and the rank of assistant commissioner (New South Wales Police, Queensland Police). Officers wear the insignia of a crown over two <b>Bath</b> <b>Stars</b> (or {{in the case of the}} New South Wales Police, a crown over two stars) the same as a Colonel in the army.|$|R
5000|$|Since the mid-1990s, the {{insignia}} of a Royal Australian Navy {{rear admiral}} is the Crown of St. Edward above a crossed sword and baton, above two silver stars, above the word [...] "Australia". Like the Royal Navy version, the sword {{is a traditional}} naval cutlass. The stars have eight points, unlike the four pointed Order of the <b>Bath</b> <b>stars</b> used by the army (which are {{often referred to as}} [...] "pips"). Prior to 1995, the RAN shoulder board was identical to the Royal Navy shoulder board. The Royal Navy shoulder board changed again in 2001 and the Australian and UK shoulder boards are now identical except for the word [...] "Australia".|$|R

5000|$|The {{insignia}} of rank is a crown above a <b>Bath</b> <b>Star,</b> {{known as}} [...] "pips", above crossed tipstaves within a wreath, {{very similar to}} the insignia worn by a full general in the British Army. This badge is all but unique within the British police, shared only with the Commissioner of the City of London Police, the smallest territorial police force, and HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary. Like all chief officer ranks in the British police, commissioners wear gorget patches on the collars of their tunics. The gorget patches are similar to those worn by generals, aside from being of silver-on-black instead of the Army's gold-on-red.|$|E
5000|$|On April 1, 2016 the Canadian Army {{announced}} that it will begin using the Maple Leaf ranks for Generals as well as reinstating gold sleeve braids on an officer's tunic cuffs. The insignia, however, will use metal pin-ons instead of the unification cloth badges. To honor the centennial of the Battle of Vimy Ridge on 1 April 2017, the Vimy Star, composed of a red maple leaf within a diamond and surrounded by the latin motto [...] "VIGILAMUS PRO TE" [...] (we stand on guard for thee, based on the lyrics of the National Anthem O Canada), replaced the <b>Bath</b> <b>Star</b> in officer shoulder boards.|$|E
50|$|On {{ceremonial}} occasions the Life Guards wear {{a scarlet}} tunic, a metal cuirass and a matching helmet {{with a white}} plume worn bound on the top into an 'onion' shape; the exceptions to this are the regiment's trumpeters, who wear a red plume, and farriers, who wear blue tunics and have a black plume. In addition, the Life Guards wear their chin strap below their lower lip, {{as opposed to the}} Blues and Royals who wear it under their chin. On service dress the Life Guards Officers and Warrant Officer Class Ones wear a red lanyard on the right shoulder, as well as a Sam Browne belt. The Life Guards, as part of the Household Division, does not use the Order of the <b>Bath</b> <b>Star</b> for its officer rank 'pips', but rather the Order of the Garter Star.|$|E

Also {{in the same}} year, she appeared in the Diane Cornell directed short See Me which also starred Tina Cole.|$|R
5000|$|Kundalkar {{directed}} short {{films and}} worked in theatre before entering the mainstream cinema. His first short film, Out of the Box, was made {{while he was still}} a student at FTII. His 2005 documentary short film The <b>Bath,</b> <b>starring</b> Rajat Kapoor, is based on an explicit gay theme. The film won 2nd prize in the Short Fiction category presented by the Indian Documentary Producers' Association (IDPA) for [...] "its sensitive depiction of issues of male sexuality" [...] and was also screened at the 30th San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival. Kundalkar has also portrayed homosexual characters in his Marathi plays Chotyasha Suteet (literally meaning In the Short Break) and Poornaviram (literally meaning Fullstop). These plays have also been staged in Hindi and English. Chotyasha Suteet has been staged as On Vacation for English audiences.|$|R
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I, German-language operetta lost its popularity. After that, Hood supplied lyrics for individual numbers for some musicals, and a revue, Bric-a-Brac with Lionel Monckton and Arthur Wimperis, and some non-musical plays. In {{the early days of}} the war, he took up a post with the Cryptography Division of the War Office. Despite the heavy demands of his wartime work, he wrote a patriotic light opera, Young England, with music by G. H. Clutsam and Hubert <b>Bath,</b> <b>starring</b> Walter Passmore, which ran at Daly's Theatre and then the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1916–17 before going on tour. In his final years, Hood developed an obsession with Shakespeare's Hamlet, which he believed contained a cryptogram that he worked to decipher. His companion of later years was Doris Armine Ashworth; she died about 1958.|$|R
5000|$|On {{ceremonial}} occasions, the Blues and Royals wear a blue tunic (inherited {{from the}} Royal Horse Guards, {{also known as}} [...] "the Blues"), a metal cuirass, and a matching helmet with a red plume worn unbound, and against popular belief the regiment's farriers wear a red plume {{like the rest of}} the regiment but do not wear the metal cuirass. In addition, the Blues and Royals wear their chin strap under their chin, as opposed to the Life Guards, who wear it below their lower lip. On service dress, the Blues and Royals wear a blue lanyard on the left shoulder, as well as a Sam Browne belt containing a whistle. In most dress orders, the Waterloo Eagle is worn on the left arm as part of dress traditions. The Blues and Royals, as part of the Household Division, does not use the Order of the <b>Bath</b> <b>Star</b> for its officer rank 'pips,' but rather the Order of the Garter Star.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} regalia of the Sovereign {{were only}} slightly more opulent than the insignia of an ordinary Knight Member of the Order. These were replaced in 1831 by new ones presented by William IV {{as part of a}} revision of the Order's structure, and containing 394 precious stones taken from the English Crown Jewels of Queen Charlotte and the Order of the <b>Bath</b> <b>star</b> of her husband George III. [...] On the badge of Saint Patrick's blue enamel, the green shamrock was of emeralds and the red Saint Patrick's Saltire of rubies; the motto of the Order was in pink diamonds and the encrustation was of Brazilian diamonds of the first water. Notices issued after the theft described the jewels thus: [...] A Diamond Star of the Grand Master of the Order of St. Patrick composed of brilliants (Brazilian stones) of the purest water, [...] by [...] inches, consisting of eight points, four greater and four lesser, issuing from a centre enclosing a cross of rubies and a trefoil of emeralds surrounding a sky blue enamel circle with words, [...] "Quis Separabit MDCCLXXXIII."

50|$|Ornithogalum pyrenaicum, {{also called}} Prussian asparagus, wild asparagus, <b>Bath</b> asparagus, Pyrenees <b>star</b> of Bethlehem, or spiked star of Bethlehem, is a plant whose young flower shoots may be eaten as a vegetable, similar to asparagus.|$|R
50|$|Launched in Bath and North East Somerset as 107.9 Bath FM {{from its}} Bathampton Down {{transmitter}} in November 1999 {{and was a}} rival station to GWR-FM Bath (now Heart). It had several ownerships such as The Local Radio Group in February 2006, Laser Broadcasting from June 2008 {{and later in the}} same year as South West Radio Ltd in October. Bath FM relaunched as Total <b>Star</b> <b>Bath</b> in August 2010 after Total Star Gloucestershire company Storm Radio Ltd teamed up with One Gold Radio Ltd (now More Radio Ltd), but the two companies soon had separated in 2011 and Total <b>Star</b> <b>Bath</b> along with two other Total Star stations in Swindon and Warminster had changed the name to More Radio in June 2011. More Radio has recently been relaunched in Bath as The Breeze in September 2011 after being bought by Celador.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, {{the play}} was revived in the UK by Theatre Royal <b>Bath,</b> <b>starring</b> Lenny Henry as Troy Maxson and {{directed}} by Paulette Randall. This production transferred to the Duchess Theatre in London's West End for a run that lasted between June and September 2013. Henry's performance attracted wide acclaim. Giles Broadbent from the Wharf said, “Lenny Henry is immense.” Charles Spencer from The Telegraph said of Henry, [...] "He is, and I don’t use the word lightly, magnificent." [...] Jane Shilling, also from the Telegraph said: [...] "What you don’t expect is to find Henry entirely unrecognisable in the physically and morally immense character he embodies." [...] Best of Theatre said: [...] "You may love or loathe his comedy but {{it is impossible to}} deny Lenny Henry’s determination to become a serious actor of some note." [...] Paul Taylor from The Independent said, “the performance cements Henry's status as a serious actor.” Henry Hitchings from the London Evening Standard said, [...] "He’s on superb form". Simon Edge from the Express said, [...] "Henry gives a perfectly controlled performance, combining physical poise with an armoury of carefully judged vocal ticks and facial mannerisms." [...] Of the production as a whole, Hitchings commented that [...] "Fences is dense and unsettling. It’s brave to programme such a meaty, daunting piece during the summer months". Camilla Gurlter from A Younger Theatre described it as “very heavy and with its nearly three hours of lost hope and broken dreams it can feel long and depressing".|$|R
