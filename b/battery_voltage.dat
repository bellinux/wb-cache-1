5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, <b>battery</b> <b>voltage,</b> oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E
25|$|One other notable change {{occurred}} during the 1916 modifications. The high voltage propulsion control was replaced with a safer low voltage propulsion control, which utilized <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> (32 volts) to control the train's motors. This <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> was what would pass through the motorman's control stand and between cars. Tractive effort throughout the train was synchronized by the <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> in this way. Meanwhile, each car would respond individually to the <b>battery</b> <b>voltage,</b> by moving its own 600 volt contacts to direct power obtained locally by each car directly from the third rail toward the motors. Using 32 volts to control the propulsion in this way was a much safer proposition for trainmen and shop personnel than the 600 volts associated with the older high voltage setup.|$|E
25|$|The points {{allow the}} coil {{magnetic}} field to build. When the points open by a cam arrangement, {{the magnetic field}} collapses inducing an EMF in the primary that is {{much larger than the}} <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> and the transformer action produces a large output voltage (20 kV or greater) from the secondary.|$|E

In connection with future missions involving an employment of high-power high voltage power subsystems and/or autonomous power subsystem management for unattended operation, {{it will be}} necessary to utilize <b>battery</b> cell <b>voltage</b> scanners to provide <b>battery</b> cell <b>voltage</b> information for early detection of impending battery cell degradation/failures. In preparation for such missions, a novel <b>battery</b> cell <b>voltage</b> scanner design has been developed. The novel design makes use of low voltage circuit modules which can be applied to high <b>voltage</b> <b>batteries</b> in a building block fashion. A description is presented of the design concept and test results of the high <b>voltage</b> <b>battery</b> cell scanner, and its operation with an autonomously managed power subsystem is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Inductively Coupled Power Transfer (ICPT) {{systems are}} {{designed}} to deliver power efficiently from a stationary primary source to movable secondary loads over air gaps via magnetic coupling. Present vehicle chargers are wired. Corrosion of connectors {{is a very serious}} problem. Frequent replacement and maintenance are needed for proper operation. For charging different vehicles with different <b>battery</b> <b>voltages</b> we have to modify the charger to suit the <b>battery</b> <b>voltages</b> that will affect the charger efficiency. This work proposes a design for practical electric vehicle charger suitable for any power vehicles (two wheelers, four wheelers, heavy motor). LCPT vehicle chargers are wireless and there is no contact problems and maintenance so it is a maintenance free charger. LCPT can charge different vehicles with different <b>battery</b> <b>voltages</b> without making any changes in the charger so the efficiency does not affect. Only the number of turns of the pickup coil (secondary coil) has to be adjusted at the time of manufacturing of the vehicles. This same concept can be used in traction system by neglecting the battery...|$|R
25|$|With the {{universal}} adoption of electrical starting for automobiles, {{and the availability}} of a large battery to provide a constant source of electricity, magneto systems were abandoned for systems which interrupted current at <b>battery</b> <b>voltage,</b> using an ignition coil to step the voltage up {{to the needs of the}} ignition, and a distributor to route the ensuing pulse to the correct spark plug at the correct time.|$|E
25|$|Mirror-image {{insertion}} protection {{means that}} a regulator is designed for use when a voltage, usually not higher than the maximum input voltage of the regulator, is applied to its output pin while its input terminal is at a low voltage, volt-free or grounded. Some regulators can continuously withstand this situation. Others might only manage it for a limited time such as 60 seconds (usually specified in the data sheet). For instance, this situation can occur when a three terminal regulator is incorrectly mounted on a PCB, with the output terminal connected to the unregulated DC input and the input connected to the load. Mirror-image insertion protection is also important when a regulator circuit is used in battery charging circuits, when external power fails or is not turned on and the output terminal remains at <b>battery</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Red {{or yellow}} LEDs {{suitable}} for use as rear lights have been available for many years. Recently, white LEDs which satisfy the requirements for a front light have come on the market, and some jurisdictions have made or are considering making these legally acceptable. [...] Very high-power LEDs are sensitive to overheating and over-driving if the enclosure or driving electronics are poorly designed. Both of these conditions can significantly shorten the LED's lifespan, causing them to dim or completely burn out. Most LEDs have a higher luminous efficacy than halogen lights, but poorly designed driving electronics can negate the advantage. Electronics are needed for battery-powered LEDs to keep light high while <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> declines, and to provide flashing and dimming.|$|E

2500|$|These {{consisted}} of a resonant reed, vibrated by an alternating magnetic field created by an AC electromagnet, with contacts that reversed {{the direction of the}} current on the negative half cycles. [...] They were used in low power devices, such as battery chargers, to rectify the low voltage produced by a step-down transformer. [...] Another use was in battery power supplies for portable vacuum tube radios, to provide the high DC voltage for the tubes. [...] These operated as a mechanical version of modern solid state switching inverters, with a transformer to step the <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> up, and a set of vibrator contacts on the transformer core, operated by its magnetic field, to repeatedly break the DC battery current to create a pulsing AC to power the transformer. [...] Then a second set of rectifier contacts on the vibrator rectified the high AC voltage from the transformer secondary to DC.|$|E
2500|$|Di Grassi {{narrowed the}} gap to Buemi {{to half a}} second with six laps remaining. Wwhile {{thinking}} about an overtaking attempt on Buemi, both men were delayed by slower traffic, causing di Grassi to drop back. Buemi had less available electrical energy than di Grassi which allowed his rival to run close behind him. Although di Grassi {{had been unable to}} use FanBoost because of <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> limitations, he was able to draw closer to Buemi on the final lap. He forced Buemi to defend his position at the Swimming Pool complex and La Rascasse corner, but could not find the space to get ahead as run to the start/finish line was not long enough, allowing Buemi to fend him off and win the race. Di Grassi finished 0.320 seconds adrift in second with Heidfeld clinching third. Heidfeld thus became the first driver to stand on the Monaco podium in both Formula One and Formula E. Piquet, Engel, Rosenqvist and Abt all finished close behind each other in positions four to seven. with Gutiérrez, Prost and Evans rounding out the top ten points-scoring finishers. Félix da Costa was adjudged to have been unsafely released from his garage and was handed a 33-second time penalty which demoted him from ninth to 11th. His teammate Frijns was running in eighth in the closing stages but lost all electrical energy on the final lap and fell to 12th. Turvey, Carroll and Sarrazin were the last of the classified finishers. It was Buemi's fourth victory of the season, his second consecutive in Monaco, and the tenth of his career. Of the other retirements, d'Ambrosio and Duval returned to the track but both retired with the former suffering from a powertrain malfunction and the latter was affected by regenerative braking problems, and both Virgin cars were not classified in the final results.|$|E

Each individual Smartphone component is held in a specific state for a significant period of time and the change in battery state of discharge is captured using built-in <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> sensors. The first challenging idea is to convert <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> readings into power consumption.

40|$|Solar energy, {{despite being}} inexhaustible, {{has a major}} shortcoming; it is intermittent. As a result, there's a need {{for it to be}} stored for later use. The widely used energy storage in {{photovoltaic}} system applications is the lead-acid battery and the knowledge of its state-of-charge (SOC) is important in effecting efficient control and energy management. However, SOC cannot be measured while the battery is connected to the system. This study adjusts and validates two estimation models: battery state-of-charge model using ampere-hour counting method and <b>battery</b> charge <b>voltage</b> model. For the battery state-of-charge model, the SOC is estimated by integrating the charge/discharge current over time while the <b>battery</b> charge <b>voltage</b> characteristic response is modelled by using the equation-fit method which expresses the <b>battery</b> charge <b>voltage</b> variations by a 5 th order polynomial in terms of the state-of-charge and current.
