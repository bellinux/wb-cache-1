25|$|The curved-tube chassis was {{the more}} {{controversial}} of the two novel ideas. The existing Cooper 500 chassis design process {{had been one of}} evolution since the earliest production 500s rolled out of the Surbiton works in 1947, and had been based on simple, traditional twin longitudinal box-section ladder frame. With the introduction of the Mark V in 1950 this was augmented by a beefed-up and stiffened <b>body</b> <b>support</b> structure, creating a semi-space frame chassis. This was refined further over the next two years, with the Mark VI marking a switch to equally sized tubular upper and lower longerons, and the Mark VIIA introducing tubular upright sections as well. However, for 1953's Mark VIII the Coopers decided to start afresh with a completely new chassis design.|$|E

40|$|Background: Lower body {{positive}} pressure (LBPP) treadmills {{can be used}} {{in rehabilitation}} programs and/or to supplement run mileage in healthy runners by reducing the effective body weight and impact associated with running. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine if <b>body</b> weight <b>support</b> influences the stride length (SL) –velocity as well as leg impact acceleration relationship during running. Methods: Subjects (n =  10, 21. 4  ±  2. 0 years, 72. 4  ±  10. 3  kg, 1. 76  ±  0. 09  m) completed 16 run conditions consisting of specific <b>body</b> weight <b>support</b> and velocity combinations. Velocities tested were 100 %, 110 %, 120 %, and 130 % of the preferred velocity (2. 75  ±  0. 36  m/s). <b>Body</b> weight <b>support</b> conditions consisted of 0, 60 %, 70 %, and 80 % <b>body</b> weight <b>support.</b> SL and leg impact accelerations were determined using a light-weight accelerometer mounted on the surface of the anterior-distal aspect of the tibia. A 4  ×  4 (velocity × body weight support) repeated measures ANOVA was used for each dependent variable (α =  0. 05). Results: Neither SL nor leg impact acceleration were influenced by the interaction of <b>body</b> weight <b>support</b> and velocity (p >  0. 05). SL was least during no <b>body</b> weight <b>support</b> (p    0. 05). Leg impact acceleration was greatest during no <b>body</b> weight <b>support</b> (p    0. 05). SL and leg impact accelerations increased with velocity regardless of support (p <  0. 05). Conclusion: The relationships between SL and leg impact accelerations with velocity were not influenced by <b>body</b> weight <b>support...</b>|$|R
