50|$|One of the {{concerns}} with inshore aquaculture is that discarded nutrients and feces can settle below the farm on the seafloor and damage the <b>benthic</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> According to its proponents, the wastes from aquaculture that has been moved offshore tend to be swept away from the site and diluted. Moving aquaculture offshore also provides more space where aquaculture production can expand to meet the increasing demands for fish. It avoids many of the conflicts that occur with other marine resource users in the more crowded inshore waters, though there can still be user conflicts offshore. Critics are concerned about {{issues such as the}} ongoing consequences of using antibiotics and other drugs and the possibilities of cultured fish escaping and spreading disease among wild fish.|$|E

Research has shown that areas dominated by xenophyophores have 3-4 times the number of benthic crustaceans, echinoderms, and molluscs than equivalent areas that lack xenophyophores. The xenophyophores themselves also play commensal host to a number of organisms - such as isopods (e.g., genus Hebefustis), sipunculan and polychaete worms, nematodes, and harpacticoid copepods - some of which may take up semi-permanent residence within a xenophyophore's test.

40|$|The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) shelf is {{deep and}} detritus-based (i. e., it {{is fueled by}} organic {{material}} sinking from intense seasonal cycles of primary production in the water column), leading to pelagic-benthic coupling. The WAP is warming rapidly, yielding increases in seawater temperatures and reductions in sea ice that may fundamentally alter pelagic-benthic coupling and shelf benthic ecosystems. RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer and ARSV Laurence M. Gould have provided year-round access to the WAP sea ice zone, facilitating studies of pelagic-benthic coupling and climate change. In the Food for Benthos along the Antarctic Continental Shelf (FOODBANCS) Project, we conducted a 15 -month field program to evaluate <b>benthic</b> <b>ecosystem</b> function across the mid-WAP shelf, testing the hypothesis that "phytodetrital material deposited from the summer bloom provides a sustained source of food for benthic detritivores during winter months, when organic-matter flux from the water column is extremely low. " We found that the intense seasonality in primary production and food availability in the WAP water column is heavily dampened at the shelf floor {{by the presence of}} a "food bank" that sustains <b>benthic</b> <b>ecosystem</b> functions (including sediment-community respiration, deposit feeding, vitellogenesis, spawning, and recruitment of benthos) over the winter; this food bank also influences community structure and life-history strategies of the WAP benthos. The persistence of the food bank may be mediated by low bottom-water temperatures, with the consequence that climate warming might reduce food availability in shelf communities. During the FOODBANCS 2 Project, we studied the <b>benthic</b> <b>ecosystem</b> response to the strong latitudinal sea ice gradient along the WAP to explore the ecosystem consequences of sea ice loss from climate change. We found that some aspects of <b>benthic</b> <b>ecosystem</b> structure (e. g., macrofaunal dominance by the polychaete Aurospio foodbancsia) covaried with sea ice duration and are likely to be sensitive to sea ice loss. Other benthic parameters (e. g., the standing crop of macro- and megabenthos) exhibited nonlinear responses, with evidence of resilience along much of the sea ice gradient and abrupt change near one end. Still other benthic parameters (e. g., sediment community respiration) changed very little with sea ice duration. We also found that climate warming is facilitating invasion of the WAP shelf by predacious king crabs, with dramatic reduction in benthic biodiversity and altered ecosystem function. In summary, some important <b>benthic</b> <b>ecosystem</b> parameters along the WAP may be resilient to climate-induced changes in pelagic-benthic coupling, while many others may be highly sensitive, responding nonlinearly to sea ice loss. Incorporation of climate change effects into WAP <b>benthic</b> <b>ecosystem</b> models, including the effects of invasive species, will be challenging until mechanisms, nonlinearities, synergies, and tipping points of climate change effects are better understood. - See more at: [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Aquatic sediments are {{of major}} {{importance}} for the cycling of environmental pollutants, acting as both sinks and secondary sources of contaminants to the ecosystem. Sediment-living organisms can affect the fate and transport of contaminants through activities like feeding and burrowing, collectively called bioturbation. Apart from high contaminant levels, the Baltic <b>benthic</b> <b>ecosystem</b> is affected by stressors such as eutrophication-induced anoxic conditions and invading alien species. The main objectives of this thesis were {{to determine the effects}} of bioturbation on contaminant fluxes in Baltic Sea sediments and to increase the understanding of how these other stressors act together upon contaminant fate in the <b>benthic</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> Bioturbation affected contaminants in a species-specific way. The native species Monoporeia affinis and Macoma balthica increased the incorporation of BDE- 99 and Cd deposited on the sediment surface, enhancing their retention in the sediment. The invasive polychaete Marenzelleria sp. did not contribute to the incorporation of surface-deposited contaminants, however, significantly increased the release of contaminants back to the water column. Reoxygenation of anoxic laminated sediments and bioturbation by Marenzelleria increased the sediment-to-water flux of dissolved organic contaminants. When the bioturbation-driven release of PCB was compared to the release caused by physical sediment resuspension, results indicated that the continuous activities of benthic infauna can be just as, or even more, important than physical disturbance for the remobilization of sediment-bound contaminants. Bioaccumulation was significantly higher when contaminants were deposited associated to phytoplankton compared to lignin or sediment, suggesting that there are likely seasonal differences in the mobilization of contaminants in the <b>benthic</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> In summary, bioturbation is an important process influencing contaminant fate in Baltic Sea sediments, and the risk of remobilization of historically buried contaminants may increase with improved benthic redox conditions and the invasion of new deeper-digging species, such as Marenzelleria...|$|E

Therefore, the AMBI, an existing marine biotic index already applied to detect impacts along European Coasts but never for the evaluation of the effects of aquaculture in the Mediterranean Sea, was developed and tested in four cases study: two off-shore fish farms, one in Sardinia and another one in Cyprus and two land-based fish farms in Tuscany. Assigning the macrobenthic species to one of the five Ecological Groups defined by this index, related to species sensitivity to disturbance, the AMBI gives back a classification of the site based on the benthic community “health status”. Thus, for each fish farm, samples of sediment were collected and chemical (total nitrogen, total carbon, organic matter, water content), physical (granulometry) and biological analysis (quantitative and qualitative indices calculation) were carried out.

However, the benthic habitats investigated so far are mainly found at very shallow water (less than or equal to 5 m depth) and therefore are not representative of the broad range of continental shelf habitats. Here, we show that a decrease from pH 8. 1 to 7. 9 observed in a CO 2 vent system at 40 m depth leads to a dramatic shift in highly diverse and structurally complex habitats. Forests of the kelp Laminaria rodriguezii usually found at larger depths (greater than 65 m) replace the otherwise dominant habitats (i. e. coralligenous outcrops and rhodolith beds), which are mainly characterized by calcifying organisms. Only the aragonite-calcifying algae are able to survive in acidified waters, while high-magnesium-calcite organisms are almost completely absent. Although a long-term survey of the venting area would be necessary to fully understand the effects of the variability of pH and other carbonate parameters over the structure and functioning of the investigated mesophotic habitats, our results suggest that in addition of significant changes at species level, moderate ocean acidification may entail major shifts in the distribution and dominance of key <b>benthic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> at regional scale, which could have broad ecological and socio-economic implication...|$|R
