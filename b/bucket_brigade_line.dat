40|$|A natural {{extension}} of the <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> model of manufacturing is capable of chaotic behavior in which the product intercompletion times are, in effect, random, even though the model is completely deterministic. This is, we believe, the first proven instance of chaos in discrete manufacturing. Chaotic behavior represents a new challenge to the traditional tools of engineering management to reduce variability in production lines. Fortunately, if configured correctly, a <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> assembly <b>line</b> can avoid such pathologies. ...|$|R
40|$|One way to {{organize}} workers that lies between traditional assembly lines, where workers are specialists, and craft assembly, where workers are generalists, are "bucket brigades. " We describe how one firm used <b>bucket</b> <b>brigades</b> {{as an intermediate}} strategy to migrate from craft assembly to assembly lines. The adoption of <b>bucket</b> <b>brigades</b> led to a narrowing of tasks for each worker and thus accelerated learning. The increased production more than compensated for the time lost when workers walk back to get more work, which was significant in this implementation. To understand the trade-offs in migrating from craft to assembly lines, we extend the standard model of <b>bucket</b> <b>brigades</b> to capture hand-off and walk-back times. <b>bucket</b> <b>brigades,</b> assembly <b>line,</b> work sharing, dynamical system, self-organizing system...|$|R
40|$|A {{fascinating}} {{feature of}} <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> assembly <b>lines</b> is that work load on workers is balanced spontaneously as workers follow some simple {{rules in the}} assembly process. This self-organizing property significantly reduces the management effort on an assembly line. We generalize this idea in several directions. These include an adapted <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> protocol for complex assembly networks, a generalized model that permits chaotic behavior, and a more detailed model for a flow line in which jobs arrive arbitrarily in time and are introduced into the system at several points on the line.

50|$|In the 16th century, {{syringes}} {{were also}} used as firefighting tools, the larger ones being mounted on wheels. Another traditional method that survived was the <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade,</b> involving two <b>lines</b> of people formed between the water source and the fire. Typically, men {{in one of the}} lines would pass along the full buckets of water toward the fire while in the other line women and children would pass back the empty buckets to be refilled.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the advent}} of the regular fire department, fire alarms were sounded by church bells and <b>bucket</b> <b>brigades</b> formed <b>lines</b> from the nearest pump to the fire. Baden's first engine house was built about 1897 just north of the {{location}} of the present fire station, which was erected in 1909. In 1919 the fire company was fully motorized, replacing the colorful horse-drawn fire apparatus. The greatest fire to occur in the area happened when the St. Louis Car Company shops burned for several days in October 1920. Baden's first regular police station was a branch of the old Mounted District in Forest Park. It was located at 8316 North Broadway and was opened in 1899. This was closed in 1928, at which time it was leased for a public library branch.|$|R

The Juno-106 also contains 128 internal memory slots for patch storage as well as surprisingly complete MIDI implementation - a rarity for any synthesizers of the time, let alone analogue ones. Compared to the 60 and 6 juno models the editing controls (sliders and buttons) on the synthesizer are capable of transmitting and receiving MIDI SysEx commands, allowing complete control and more advanced MIDI based modulation of the instrument via a sequencer or computer.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{all possible}} asymptotic behavior of "bucket <b>brigade</b> " production <b>lines</b> wilh {{two or three}} workers, each characterized by a constant work velocity. The results suggest wariness in interpreting simulation results. They also suggest a strategy for partitioning a workforce into effective teams to staff the lines. B ucket b/igade production {{is a way of}} organizing work-ers on a flow line, in which there are fewer workers than stations. Eaeh worker carries a single item from sta-tion to station, waiting if necessary for that station to be-come available (workers are not allowed to pass eaeh other). When the last worker completes an item, he walks back to take over the item of his predecessor, who relin-quishes it and walks back to take over the item of his predecessor, and so on until the first worker walks back to start a new item. <b>Bucket</b> <b>brigades</b> are in use in at least two commercial environments: apparel manufacturing (Bartholdi and Eisenstein 1996) and distribution warehousing (Barthoidi et ai. 1999). In both environments, two- and three-worker teams are common. Figure 1 summarizes all asymptotic (stable) behavior of a <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> flow <b>line</b> with three workers. By "stable behavior " we mean qualitative structure that persists, even in the presence of perturbations. This is the behavior that will assert itself in praetice. Most of the behavior we char-acterize is distinctive and can be easily recognized on the shop floor. This categorization of behavior is based on the model of Theorem 3 of Barthoidi and Eisenstein (1996) in which the work to assemble an item is deterministic and is spread continuously and uniformly over a line (rather than con-centrated at work stations). TTiis model has several important properties. • It is simple enough to analyze. • The behavior of this model underlies natural generaliza-tions, such as when the amount of work within an inter-val of space is random and independent from that within disjoint intervals. In such cases the dynamics due to random work are merely superimposed upon the de-terministic dynamics. (See, for example, Barthoidi et al...|$|R
40|$|A {{cellular}} <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> {{is a way}} {{to coordinate}} workers along an aisle with work content on both sides. Each worker in a cellular <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> works {{on one side of the}} aisle when he proceeds in one direction, and he works on the other side when he proceeds in the reverse direction. Although the cellular <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> eliminates the unproductive walk-back, it requires more hand-offs to assemble a product than a traditional (serial) <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade.</b> These hand-offs may waste significant production capacity as each of them requires an exchange of work, which can be complicated and time-consuming in practice. This motivates us to investigate the impact of hand-off times on the cellular <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> 2 ̆ 7 s performance. We identify sufficient conditions to ensure no workers are idle in the long run and for the system to self-balance in a model with hand-off times.

It is shown that, if {{the rules of}} the <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> system allow a re-ordering of its workers then the <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> production system is very robust and will typically rebalance to a self-organizing optimal production arrangement. As workers learn only those parts of the production line that they work on, the stationary velocity distribution for the workers of a stable <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> is non-uniform over the production line.

40|$|One way to {{coordinate}} the efforts of workers along an assembly line that has fewer workers than work stations is to form a <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade.</b> Each worker in a <b>bucket</b> <b>brigade</b> simultaneously assembles a single item (an instance of the product) along the line.
