40|$|Screening {{results of}} 488 {{pregnant}} women aged 15 – 44 years whose blood samples had been tested on-site, using First Response® HIV 1 / 2, and confirmed with INNO-LIA™ HIV I/II Score were used.

5|$|A {{physical}} examination and medical history {{are generally not}} enough to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious bursitis; aspiration of the bursal fluid is often required for this, along with a cell culture and Gram stain of the aspirated fluid. Septic prepatellar bursitis may be diagnosed if the fluid is {{found to have a}} neutrophil count above 1500 per microliter, a threshold significantly lower than that of septic arthritis (50,000 cells per microliter). A tuberculosis infection can <b>be</b> <b>confirmed</b> using a roentgenogram and urinalysis.|$|E

A second competition, in 1926, produced 18 entries, out of which the design by the architectural firm Woods, Bagot, Jory & Laybourne-Smith was selected as the winner.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is due to}} {{elevated}} levels of uric acid in the blood. This occurs due {{to a combination of}} diet and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who eat a lot of meat, drink a lot of beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may <b>be</b> <b>confirmed</b> by seeing the crystals in joint fluid or tophus. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack.|$|E

5|$|Long-range atomic {{exchange}} {{is a process}} involving an adatom inserting into the surface as in the normal atomic exchange mechanism, but instead of a nearest-neighbor atom it is an atom some distance further from the initial adatom that emerges.

In spite of this long range atomic exchange, as well as a variety of other exotic diffusion mechanisms, are anticipated to contribute substantially at temperatures currently too high for direct observation.|$|E
5|$|Morphological and {{allozyme}} analyses {{have agreed}} that the common thresher is basal to the clade formed by the bigeye thresher and the pelagic thresher (A. pelagicus).

5|$|Ruth Bader Ginsburg (born Joan Ruth Bader; March 15, 1933) is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Ginsburg was {{appointed}} by President Bill Clinton and took {{the oath of office}} on August 10, 1993. She is the second female justice to <b>be</b> <b>confirmed</b> to the Court (after Sandra Day O'Connor), and one of four female justices to <b>be</b> <b>confirmed</b> (with Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, who are still serving). Following Justice O'Connor's retirement, and prior to Justice Sotomayor joining the Court, Ginsburg was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, noted by legal observers and in popular culture. She is generally viewed as belonging to the liberal wing of the Court. Notable majority opinions Ginsburg has authored include United States v. Virginia, Olmstead v. L.C., and Friends of the Earth Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.|$|E
