The lower wings were attached directly to the fuselage, touching the water when afloat, improving water-borne stability.

Incidence of the upper wing was adjustable by altering the length of the forward N-strut tubes.|$|E
40|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} in crane runway girders to place a channel, open-side down, over the top flange of a W- or S-section. The built-up WC (W-section with Channel) or SC (S-section with Channel) section has been proven to be efficient and economical. However, the theoretical moment calculation for WC/SC section is not a tough task and the difficulty comes from the evaluation of torsional properties including warping constant (Cw), monosymmetric parameter (βx), and torsional constant (J). The AISC specification provides the approximate formulas which are derived from singly symmetric I-shaped sections. Results from this study show that these formulas underestimate the elastic moment strength of WC/SC girders. This paper furnish the formulas for the torsional properties (Cw, βx, J) of WC/SC sections. The moment design parameters and torsional properties of WC/SC girders evaluated based on the theory and AISC are provided in tabular forms. The provided tables are to assist practicing engineers to approach the <b>built-up</b> <b>girder</b> design in a simplified but rational way...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{light gauge}} cold-formed steel {{members have been}} used {{extensively}} in low and mid- rise residential building construction. In cold-formed steel design there are several applications where built-up box girders are used to resist load induced in a structure when a single section {{is not sufficient to}} carry the design load. The cold-formed steel box girders may be subjected to eccentric loading when the web of one of the sections receives the load and transfers it through the connection to another section. There may be an unequal distribution of load in <b>built-up</b> <b>girder</b> assemblies loaded from one side. In the current North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members (CSA-S 136 - 01, 2001), there is no guideline or design equation to calculate the flexural capacity of this type of section. AISI cold-formed steel framing design guide (2002) has recommended that the moment of resistance and inertia of the built-up section are the simple addition of the component parts, based on deflection compatibility of the two sections. However, this design approximation has not been justified by any experimental or numerical study. Very little information was found in literature about this topic. The objective of this study is the investigation of the flexural behaviour of built-up box girders assembled from cold-formed stud and track sections when subjected to eccentric loading. Finite element analysis is conducted for this purpose, being much more economical than expensive experimental testing. Detailed parametric studies are carried out to identify the factors affecting the flexural capacity of built-up cold-formed steel sections. The parametric results are used to develop a design equation for calculating the flexural capacity of built-up cold-formed steel sections...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{large number}} of bridges in the {{inventory}} having built-up steel construction. The majority of these bridges were constructed prior to the 1960 s. This means that most of these bridges are approaching, or have surpassed, their original design life. It is widely accepted in the engineering community that built-up members possess internal member-level redundancy due to the number of different load paths created by the fastening of multiple components together with rivets or high-strength bolts. However, there is very little experimental research which addresses the capacity of <b>built-up</b> <b>girders</b> after a component failure. ^ The purpose of this research was to describe the behavior of mechanically fastened <b>built-up</b> <b>girders</b> in a partially failed condition. This was achieved by testing large-scale riveted and high-strength bolted built-up specimens to determine their fracture resilience at low temperatures and their fatigue capacity after a single component was failed. Additionally, a finite element parametric study was performed to understand the behavior of <b>built-up</b> <b>girders</b> and to better describe the load distribution that occurs locally in the region adjacent to a failed component. ^ The results of this research program indicate that the redundant load paths within mechanically fastened girders allows the girders to resist catastrophic fracture of an entire member in the event that a single component fractured. Additionally, it is illustrated that a conservative lower bounding of the fatigue data is represented by the AASHTO Category D fatigue curve. Finally, the results of the parametric study are used to determine factors affecting the calculated stresses which can be used to determine the remaining fatigue life of <b>built-up</b> <b>girders</b> with a component failure. ...|$|R
5000|$|The hulls had a Zeppelin-type {{structure}} comprising seven 20-sided main rings, three intermediate rings between {{each pair of}} main rings, and wire bracing; however, the structural members were of Duralumin tubing, rather than the <b>built-up</b> <b>girders</b> of earlier rigids. The structure was described as [...] "half as heavy and twice {{as strong as the}} structural material in the ill-fated Hindenburg." [...] The hulls were enclosed by a double-layer outer cover, comprising an outer Tedlar layer and an inner layer of ripstop nylon treated with dope. The gas cells were also made of Tedlar. The fins were of sheet Duralumin on frames of the same material, joined primarily with epoxy resin rather than by riveting.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years there has been {{sustainable}} development in the steel and composite construction technology. One of the recent additions to such developments is the I-girders with corrugated web beams. The use of these new generation beams results in a range of benefits, including flexible, free internal spaces and reduced foundation costs. Corrugated web beams are <b>built-up</b> <b>girders</b> with a thin-walled, corrugated web and wide plate flanges. The thin corrugated web affords a significant weight reduction of these beams, compared with hot-rolled or welded ones. In this paper, optimum design of corrugated composite beams is presented. A recent stochastic optimization algorithm coded that is based on hunting search is used for obtaining the solution of the design problem. In the optimisation process, besides the thickness of concrete slab and studs, web height and thickness, distance between the peaks of the two curves, the width and thickness of flange are considered as design variables. The design constraints are respectively implemented from BS EN 1993 - 1 : 2005 (Annex-D, Eurocode 3) BS- 8110 and DIN 18 - 800 Teil- 1. Furthermore, these selections are also carried out such that the design limitations are satisfied and the weight of the composite corrugated web beam is the minimum. ...|$|R

Masonry buildings supported their internal floors through their walls, but the taller the building, the thicker the walls had to become, particularly at the base. In the 1860s, French engineers experimented with using <b>built-up</b> plate <b>girders</b> made of wrought iron to construct buildings supported by internal metal frames. These frames were stronger than traditional masonry and permitted much thinner walls. The methodology was extensively described in engineering journals and was initially used to build warehouses.|$|R

40|$|The Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) has {{implemented}} {{the use of}} precast concrete panels for bridge deck construction. A bridge utilizing these panels as a reconstruction method was decommissioned {{three years after the}} new deck installation, due to unrelated matters. Two sections of this bridge were salvaged and sent to Utah State University (USU) for destructive testing. Each bridge section consisted of two <b>built-up</b> steel plate <b>girders</b> intact with the precast concrete deck panels. The precast panels were designed and constructed to achieve full composite action between the deck and <b>built-up</b> steel plate <b>girders</b> through the use of Nelson shear studs. Additionally, the precast panels span the transverse direction and as such have a transverse joint. Historic data has shown the transverse joint to be an area of concern for the functionality of the structural system. Flexure, beam shear, and punching shear of the deck ultimate capacities were compared to those calculated in accordance to the AASTHO Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Bridge Design Specifications. Various experimental tests considered the affects of the transverse joint on the elastic and plastic capacities and code adherence. Nine destructive tests were performed. The Nelson shear studs were found to be capable of achieving the ultimate capacities of all three types of performed tests and therefore a significant level composite action was attained throughout the experimental tests. The transverse joints show a slight decrease in flexural elastic capacity, no measurable influence on flexural plastic capacity and beam shear ultimate capacity, and a 40 % decrease to ultimate punching shear capacity to the deck compared to punching shear capacity without a transverse joint...|$|R
40|$|Mechanically {{fastened}} built-up steel {{members have}} long been known to possess internal member redundancy and, as a result, multiple load paths which can be exploited to increase their functional life. Internal redundancy provides the ability to resist total member failure {{in the event of}} a fracture of an individual component. However, there is little experimental data in the literature regarding post-fracture capacity in terms of strength and subsequent fatigue life. The experimental study currently underway will provide needed information on parameters that affect the ability of built- up members to arrest a fracture as well as the available remaining fatigue life. Additionally, further information concerning load redistribution and energy release during a fracture is being studied. Test specimens consist of both existing riveted and new high-strength bolted large-scale <b>built-up</b> plate <b>girders.</b> The results from this study will be used to develop recommended design and assessment procedures for both types of members in the as-fractured condition. The potential exists to remove the fracture critical classification from existing and new bridges in which built-up members are utilized. In cases where sufficient capacity exists and the fracture critical designation can be removed, rational in- service inspection procedures will also be developed. This presentation will report on the research results obtained to date. Considering the large number of riveted fracture critical bridges in the inventory, many agencies will benefit through implementation of more rational based inspection frequencies resulting from this study. Further, new members utilizing high-strength bolted built-up members could also be used without the penalty of being classified as fracture critical in terms of inspection...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of elastic moment for <b>built-up</b> crane runway <b>girders</b> {{is not an}} easy task as the difficulty involves the calculation of torsional properties including warping constant, the coefficient of monosymmetry, and torsion constant. To date, all AISC specifications offer no specific formulas for determining the elastic critical moment for WC (W-shape with Cap channel) or SC (S-shape with Cap Channel) girders. They provide only the approximate formulas which were derived from singly symmetric I-sections. Based on this study, the AISC approximate formulas would underestimate the elastic critical moment of WC/SC girders by 6 – 25 % depending upon the unbraced length. This paper first summarizes the theoretical and AISC formulas for WC/SC girders. Theoretical torsional properties and relevant design parameters for WC/SC girders are computed and arranged in tabular form for design purposes. With these design values made available, engineers can perform more rational {{evaluation of}} WC/SC girders more conveniently. Lastly, a simplified but rational design approach is proposed for all available WC and SC girders listed in the AISC design manuals...|$|R
40|$|Parameters (Lp and Lr) for LRFD (1993, 1999) and AISC (2005, 2010) {{have been}} studied. This study has {{explored}} major fundamental equations {{regarding to the}} flexural design of steel beam based on the AISC (2005, 2010). Various beam sections, which are double symmetric I-shaped with compact webs and noncompact or slender flanges, and other I-shaped members with compact or noncompact webs, were investigated. The various failure modes involved in beams were discussed. They are elastic, inelastic and plastic modes for the lateral-torsional buckling of beams. The current AISC specifications provide no theoretical formulas for the elastic critical moment of WC section, but do give the approximate formulas which were actually derived from a singly symmetric I-shaped section as briefly described in this study. Based on this study, the AISC approximate formulas underestimate the elastic critical moments of WC section. It again thoroughly discusses of theoretical elastic moment for <b>built-up</b> crane runway <b>girders.</b> The difficulty comes {{from some of the}} evaluation of torsion properties including the warping constant (Cw) and coefficient of monosymmetry (βx), the torsion constant (J). This new set of design parameters and properties for WC section will enable practicing engineers to perform more in-depth evaluation in their routine deigns. The formulas for beam webs and flanges with concentrated loads are also introduced and investigated in this study. These include the flange local bending, the web local yielding, the web crippling, and the web sidesway buckling. 本研究比較撓曲設計參數（Lp, Lr）在LRFD (1993, 1999) 與AISC (2005, 2010) 之間的差異。整合介紹AISC (2005, 2010) 之鋼樑構件撓曲設計之方程式和基本背景:包含有雙對稱I-型結實斷面、非結實斷面與細長斷面，其它I-型結實斷面與非結實斷面。在側向扭曲挫曲的情況下，提出雙對稱I-型結實斷面與非結實斷面的例子，分析彈性、非彈性與塑性的行為。 因為現有設計規範沒有提供適當公式作為計算彎矩強度，僅以雙對稱I-型樑以及單對稱I-型樑相關之簡化公式評估單對稱斷面之彈性彎矩強度。所以進一步探討單對稱鋼樑斷面的彎矩強度，評估WC斷面理論強度時，必須計算翹曲常數Cw、單對稱係數以及扭力常數J。因為翹曲常數Cw、單對稱係數以及扭力常數J等牽涉到複雜積分運算。所以本研究提供常見WC 斷面之翹曲常數Cw、單對稱係數、扭力常數J以及設計相關表值。進而評估現有規範與理論值之差異。最後在針對集中荷重在梁的翼板與腹板時，分別有flange local bending、web local yielding、web crippling與web sidesway buckling四種狀態下分別進行討論，並整理相關規範與例題。Table of Contents Abstract………………………………………………………………… [...] .
