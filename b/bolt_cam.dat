50|$|The Weatherby Mark V action uses an {{interrupted}} screw breech as used on many artillery pieces. The nine lugs {{are actually}} sections of a screw thread. The <b>bolt</b> <b>cams</b> forward slightly as the bolt is closed following the pitch {{angle of the}} screw thread.Weatherby designed the action type with nine locking lugs arranged in three rows. It was determined early on that these lugs would not protrude outside the bolt but would be of the same diameter as the bolt body itself. Such a design would be conducive to a smooth fluid movement of the bolt through its feeding and extraction cycles.|$|R

50|$|The FNC is a {{selective}} fire weapon {{that uses a}} gas-operated long-stroke piston system and a rotating bolt locking mechanism equipped with two locking lugs that engage corresponding recesses in the barrel extension. The bolt is rotated and unlocked by {{the interaction of the}} <b>bolt's</b> <b>cam</b> pin with a camming guide contained in the bolt carrier. Overall, the mechanism strongly resembles that of Kalashnikov rifles, but adapted to more advanced design and production methods. The rear part of the cocking handle slot, cut in the upper receiver for the cocking handle, is covered by a spring-loaded cover which automatically opens by the handle when it goes back and automatically closes the opening when the cocking handle returns forward.|$|R

25|$|The CPW weighs only 1.5kg empty/dry (2kg with a {{fully loaded}} 30-round 9mm magazine) {{and uses a}} unique <b>bolt</b> lever <b>cam</b> recoil {{mitigation}} system to control recoil and muzzle rise to increase target hits. Full-auto cyclic rate of fire is a relatively high 900 to 1100rpm.|$|R
50|$|Although {{formally}} classed as {{a delayed}} blowback, the delay is minimal and certainly had little practical effect {{as seen by}} {{the high rate of}} fire. The mechanism is the usual one of bolt and return spring, but the bolt is controlled by a track in the receiver body that causes the bolt to rotate 45 degrees as it closes. The striker carries a lug bearing on the receiver track that also bears on a cam face on the bolt, so that the firing pin, driven by the return spring, cannot go forward to fire the cartridge until the bolt has rotated. When the gun is fired, recoil of the cartridge case moves the bolt back, causing it to rotate to the unlocked position, during which movement the pin is withdrawn by the action of the <b>bolt's</b> <b>cam</b> surface. Once unlocked the bolt is free to recoil and complete the firing cycle.|$|R
50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of direct impingement {{is that the}} breech of the firearm's firing mechanism becomes fouled more quickly due to being exposed to the propellants of the cartridge. This is caused by solids from the high-temperature gas condensing on the bolt face and primary operating mechanism. The combustion gases contain vaporized metals, carbon, and impurities in a gaseous state until they contact cooler operating parts. The deposits increase friction on the <b>bolt's</b> <b>camming</b> system leading to malfunctions, so that thorough and frequent cleaning is required to ensure reliability. The amount of fouling depends upon the rifle's design {{as well as the}} type of propellant powder used. For example, the French MAS 44 and MAS 49 series of rifles was known to have been successfully operated for years with corrosive-primed ammunition using ordinary field cleaning expedients such as gasoline (as solvent) and straight-grade motor oil (as lubricant)..|$|R
5000|$|Climbing {{protection}} is {{any of a}} variety of devices employed to reduce risk and protect others while climbing rock and ice. [...] It includes such items as nylon webbing and metal nuts, <b>cams,</b> <b>bolts,</b> and pitons.|$|R
50|$|After the breech is exposed, an odd lever-type extractor/ejector, mounted {{under the}} barrel, pivots to the rear, {{extracts}} the empty case, and ejects {{it through the}} bottom of the receiver. The <b>bolt's</b> operating <b>cam</b> then forces the bolt face to pivot downward, aligning a cartridge feed groove in {{the left side of the}} bolt with the chamber. While the bolt and barrel are returning forward, a cartridge-rammer lever, mounted on the barrel extension, pivots forward, loading a fresh cartridge.|$|R
50|$|The Stoner 63 {{series of}} weapons are gas-operated, air-cooled, belt or magazine-fed and in rifle and carbine configuration, fire from a closed bolt to ensure maximum accuracy, or in machine gun mode, {{fire from the}} open bolt {{position}} to prevent cook-offs and enhance cooling. The weapon has a rotary bolt locking mechanism with 7 radially symmetrical locking lugs that engage a series of recesses in the barrel extension, and is actuated by a conventional long-stroke piston. The radial arrangement of locking lugs distributes the firing load evenly around the bolt head and barrel socket, reducing stress and increasing the longevity of these critical components. Attached to the piston extension is the bolt carrier which {{is equipped with a}} curved cam track that guides the <b>bolt's</b> <b>cam</b> pin (retained by the firing pin) and rotates the bolt 22.5° during the movement of the piston to either lock or unlock the bolt from behind the abutments in the barrel socket. Incorporated into the bolt carrier/piston group is an anti-bounce device, consisting of a 4 in carbide rod that rides within the piston extension’s hollow interior and moves back and forth during the recoil and counter-recoil cycles, reducing bolt bounce and preventing the possibility of firing out of battery during closed bolt firing (in the Rifle/Carbine models).|$|R
50|$|The modern stud type {{follower}} {{was invented}} and patented in 1937 by Thomas L. Robinson of the McGill Manufacturing Company. It replaced using a standard bearing and <b>bolt.</b> The new <b>cam</b> followers were {{easier to use}} because the stud was already included and they could also handle higher loads.|$|R
50|$|The Roth-Steyr pistol fires from {{an unusual}} style of locked breech. The bolt is very long. Its rear end is solid, {{except for a}} sleeve for the striker, but its front part is hollow and fits tightly over the barrel. The {{interior}} of the <b>bolt</b> has <b>cam</b> grooves cut into it, and the barrel has studs which fit into the grooves. When the pistol is fired, the barrel and bolt recoil together within the hollow receiver for about 0.5 inch. During this operation, the helical grooves in the muzzle bush cause the barrel to turn 90 degrees clockwise, after which it is held while the unlocked bolt continues to the rear, cocking the action as it does so. For safety with intended use by mounted cavalry, the pistol has a heavy trigger pull against the firing striker spring, similar to a hammerless revolver.|$|R
50|$|The locked-breech {{blowback}} system mirrored that of John Pedersen's Remington Model 51 {{only with a}} locking recess above rather than below the bolt. When the firearm is in battery, the breech block rests slightly forward of the locking shoulder in the frame. When the cartridge is fired, the breech block and bolt carrier move together a short distance rearward powered by {{the energy of the}} cartridge as in a standard {{blowback system}}. When the breech block contacts the locking shoulder, it stops, locking the breech. The bolt carrier continues rearward with the momentum it acquired in the initial phase. This delay allows chamber pressure to drop to safe levels while the breech is locked and the cartridge slightly extracted. Once the bullet leaves the barrel and pressure drops, the continuing motion of the <b>bolt</b> carrier <b>cams</b> the breech block from its locking recess, continuing the operating cycle.|$|R
5000|$|... "U-brakes" [...] (also {{known by}} the trademarked term [...] "990-style") are {{essentially}} the same design as the centre-pull caliper brake. The {{difference is that the}} two arm pivots attach directly to the frame or fork while those of the centre-pull caliper brake attach to an integral bridge frame that mounts to the frame or fork by a single <b>bolt.</b> Like roller <b>cam</b> brakes, this is a caliper design with pivots located above the rim. Thus U-brakes are often interchangeable with, and have the same maintenance issues as, roller cam brakes.|$|R
5000|$|The Madsen has {{a rather}} {{sophisticated}} and unique operating cycle. The machine gun uses a mixed recoil-operated locking {{system with a}} hinged bolt that is patterned after the lever-action Peabody Martini breechblock. The recoil operation is part short and part long recoil. After firing a round to start the open bolt firing cycle, the initial recoil impulse drives the barrel, barrel extension, and bolt to the rear. A pin {{on the right side}} of the bolt moves backward in grooves in an operating cam plate mounted to the right side of the receiver. After 12.7 mm of travel, the <b>bolt</b> is <b>cammed</b> upward, away from the breech (the [...] "short" [...] portion of the recoil system). The barrel and barrel extension continue to move rearward to a point slightly exceeding the combined overall length of the cartridge case and projectile (the long portion of the recoil system, responsible for the weapon's low rate of fire).|$|R
5000|$|The Model L is a {{selective}} fire, roller-delayed blowback firearm. The weapon features a semi-rigid two-piece bolt mechanism {{that consists of}} a bolt head and a supporting angular locking piece. During the [...] "unlocking" [...] sequence, the two cylindrical rollers contained in the <b>bolt</b> head are <b>cammed</b> inward against inclined flanks of the barrel extension and act upon the locking piece and bolt carrier, propelling it rearward at a velocity {{greater than that of}} the bolt, which remains closed until the fired bullet has left the barrel and pressures inside the bore have been reduced to a safe level before withdrawing together with the bolt carrier.|$|R
50|$|A typical trapped-key {{interlock}} device {{consists of a}} lock cylinder which operates a sliding <b>bolt</b> through a <b>cam.</b> The assembly is contained in a housing, which is made in different styles to accommodate different applications. The sliding bolt, when extended, mechanically prevents operation of a switch, valve, gate, or other device. Many variations exist, with different shapes of interlock bolt and multiple lock cylinders on an interlock. A significant feature of the interlock is that the key is held or trapped in one position of the lock. Releasing the key indicates that the interlocked device has been made safe; the interlocked device cannot be re-energized until the key has been returned and operated to retract the bolt.|$|R
5000|$|.....I {{had in mind}} to {{have both}} an {{internal}} and an external brake on both wheels - hence the sixth hole just above the <b>cam</b> <b>bolt</b> hole. After giving the external brakes a good trial, I found the internal ones did all the work I required them to do; so I just cut out the external ones altogether, and connected the foot brake pedal {{to one side and}} the side brake lever to the other side, which means you only brake on one wheel. But this does not matter at all as owing to the axle being solid and both wheels and brake drums being keyed solid to it you get no skidding effect whatever.|$|R
50|$|The HK33 is a {{selective}} fire weapon with Heckler & Koch's roller-delayed blowback system of operation. It employs a two-piece bolt {{consisting of a}} bolt head {{with a pair of}} rollers and bolt carrier. Upon firing, the two cylindrical rollers in the <b>bolt</b> head are <b>cammed</b> inward by inclined surfaces of the barrel extension and impart a rearward motion on the locking piece, which also propels the bolt carrier rearward. This built-in mechanical disadvantage delays the movement of the bolt head relative to the bolt carrier which is withdrawing at four times the velocity of the bolt. The rollers soon compress entirely into the bolt head, clearing the locking recesses of the barrel extension, and both parts now continue rearward together, opening the breech and actuating the extraction and feeding cycles. The chamber is opened under very high pressure, thus the chamber received a series of flutes in order to increase extraction reliability and prevent sticking of the spent casing to the chamber walls.|$|R
5000|$|Since its introduction, the M855A1 {{has been}} criticized for its St. Mark’s SMP842 {{propellant}} causing increased fouling of the gun barrel. Post-combat surveys have reported no issues with the EPR in combat. A series of tests found no significant difference in fouling between the old M855 and the M855A1. However, manufacturers have reported [...] "severe degradation" [...] to barrels of their rifles using the M855A1 in tests. The Army attributes pressure and wear issues with the M855A1 to problems with the primer, which they claim to have addressed with a newly designed primer. It uses a modified four-pronged primer anvil for more reliable powder ignition, with a stab crimp rather than a circumferential crimp to better withstand the new load’s higher chamber pressure, increased from [...] to [...] During Army carbine testing, the round caused [...] "accelerated bolt wear" [...] from higher chamber pressure and increased bore temperatures. Special Operator testing saw cracks appear on locking lugs and <b>bolts</b> at <b>cam</b> pin holes on average at 6,000 rounds, but sometimes as few as 3,000 rounds during intense automatic firing. Firing several thousand rounds with such high chamber pressures can lead to degraded accuracy over time as parts wear out; these effects can be mitigated through a round counter to keep track of part service life. Weapons with barrel lengths shorter than the M4 firing the M855A1 also experience 50 percent higher pressures than a full-length M16 rifle barrel, which can cause port erosion that can boost the automatic fire rate, increasing the likelihood of jams.|$|R
50|$|Dismantling the md. 63/65 is {{identical}} to dismantling the AKM and it involves the operator depressing the magazine catch and removing the magazine. The charging handle is pulled to the rear and the operator inspects the chamber to verify the weapon is unloaded. The operator presses forward on the retainer button {{at the rear of}} the receiver cover while simultaneously lifting up on the rear of the cover to remove it. The operator then pushes the spring assembly forward and lifts it from its raceway, withdrawing it out of the bolt carrier and to the rear. The operator must then pull the carrier assembly all the way to the rear, lift it, and then pull it away. The operator removes the bolt by pushing it to the rear of the bolt carrier; rotating the <b>bolt</b> so the <b>camming</b> lug clears the raceway on the underside of the bolt carrier and then pulls it forward and free. When cleaning, the operator will pay special attention to the barrel, bolt face, and gas piston, then oil lightly and reassemble.|$|R
50|$|The M1941 rifle {{used the}} energy from recoil {{to operate the}} rifle. As the bullet and {{propellant}} gases moved down the barrel, they imparted a force on the bolt head that was locked to the barrel. The barrel, together with the bolt, moved a short distance rearward until the bullet left the barrel and pressure in the bore had dropped to safe levels. The barrel then stopped against a shoulder allowing the bolt carrier to continue rearward under the momentum imparted by the initial recoil stage. The rotating bolt, which had eight locking lugs, would then lock the <b>bolt.</b> Following, a <b>cam</b> arrangement then rotated and unlocked the bolt to continue the operating cycle. One disadvantage of this design was {{its impact on the}} use of a bayonet, as the complex movements of the barrel would be subject to unacceptable stress when a bayonet thrust was used. The Johnson rifle utilized a unique 10-round rotary magazine and a two-piece stock, the weapon using the same 5 round stripper clips used by the M1903 Rifle.|$|R
5000|$|After a six-stage zinc {{phosphate}} rustproofing process and two minutes submerged in a [...] electrophoretic painting vat (Fisher Body Division’s [...] "Elpo" [...] electrophoretic deposition of polymers process) to prime and further {{protect them from}} rust, assembled bodies were dried, wet-sanded, sealer-coated, sprayed with acrylic lacquer and baked in a [...] degree oven. Fisher's rustproofing was faulty. Failure to penetrate a gap between front fenders and cowl allowed moist debris and salt to rust the untreated steel, and trapped air prevented coating inside {{the tops of the}} front fenders, which on early Vegas had no protective liners. The finance department had rejected liners as they would have added a $2.28 unit cost. After GM spent millions replacing thousands of corroded fenders under warranty, Chevrolet installed stopgap plastic deflectors in late 1973 and full plastic liners in 1974. Rust also damaged the rocker panels and door bottoms, the area beneath the windshield, and the body above the rockers. It sometimes seized the front suspension <b>cam</b> <b>bolts,</b> preventing alignment work, necessitating removal with a cutting torch and replacement by all-new parts.|$|R
