5|$|Menzies became prime {{minister}} again in December 1949, and he resolved that Blamey should <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> {{to the rank}} of field marshal, something that had been mooted in 1945. The recommendation went via the Governor-General, William McKell, to the War Office in London, which replied that a dominion officer could not <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> to the rank. Menzies pointed out that Jan Smuts already had. The War Office then claimed that Blamey could not <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> to field marshal because he was a retired officer, which was not true. Menzies then restored Blamey to active duty. Blamey was duly promoted to field marshal in the King's Birthday Honours of 8 June 1950.|$|E
5|$|A report {{commissioned}} by the Ministry of Defence in 1995 {{made a number of}} recommendations for financial savings in the armed forces' budget, one of which was the abolition of the five-star ranks. Part of the rationale was that these ranks were disproportionate {{to the size of the}} forces commanded by these officers and that none of the United Kingdom's close allies, such as the United States (which reserves the rank of general of the army for officers who have commanded large armies in major wars), used such ranks. The recommendation was not taken up in full, but the practice of promoting service chiefs to five-star ranks was stopped and the ranks are now reserved for special circumstances. Sir Peter Inge was, in 1994, the last active officer to <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> to the rank. Inge relinquished the post of Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) in 1997 and his successor, Sir Charles Guthrie, was the first officer not to <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> upon appointment as CDS.|$|E

5|$|When a pawn {{advances}} to the eighth rank, {{as a part}} of the move it is promoted and must be exchanged for the player's choice of queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. Usually, the pawn is chosen to <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> to a queen, but in some cases another piece is chosen; this is called underpromotion. In the animated diagram, the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> to an allowed piece. There is no restriction placed on the piece that is chosen on promotion, so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game (for example, two queens).|$|E

In the lead-up to the 2002 season Hall played in all three of Essendon's pre-season matches, of which the Bombers lost every game.

5|$|Another reason exports cannot <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> {{is because}} in all likelihood, an {{underdeveloped}} country {{may only be}} skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods, say agricultural goods. However, since such commodities face inelastic demand, {{the extent to which}} they will sell in the market is limited. Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E
