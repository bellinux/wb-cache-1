5|$|In 1985, few {{countries}} had women's national football teams. While the sport gained popularity worldwide {{in the ensuing}} years, Guinea-Bissau's team only began play {{more than two decades}} later. By the end of 2006, the team had played in two FIFA-recognised matches. The first was on 28 October 2006 against Guinea in <b>Bissau,</b> which ended in a 1-1 tie after Guinea-Bissau led 1-0 at half-time. On 12 November 2006, the team played in their second FIFA-recognised match in Conakry, where Guinea-Bissau lost to Guinea 1-3. At the time, the team held three training sessions a week. The team has not participated in some of the major international and regional football competitions, including the Women's World Cup, the 2010 African Women's Championship and the 2011 All-Africa Games.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April, gunfire {{was heard}} between 19:00 and 21:00, as mutinous troops {{attempted}} {{to overthrow the}} government by seizing control of the centre of the capital <b>Bissau.</b> Initial reports by diplomats in the country said presidential candidate Carlos Gomes Júnior and interim President Raimundo Pereira were missing. The mutineers seized control of the offices of the incumbent African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) and radio stations. They also fought police officers loyal to the government, forcing them to retreat after coming under fire from RPGs. The soldiers blocked the roads {{into and out of the}} capital city and the national radio and television was taken off-air at 20:00.|$|E

5|$|There is {{a sizable}} Serbian American {{diaspora}} in the United States; in 2007 {{a total of}} 172,834 people of Serbian nationality or descent were recorded to be inhabiting the U.S. The first documented wave of Serbian immigrants to the United States was recorded in the 1970s when many Serbian factory workers emigrated to Detroit to manufacture automobiles for Ford. In 2011, Serbia was ranked second in the world (after Guinea <b>Bissau)</b> in human capital flight according to USAID. Brain drain to the United States and Canada has been cited as a chronic phenomenon in Serbia, especially from 1990 to 2000 during the decade of UN sanctions and war.|$|E
5|$|Days {{before the}} coup, fellow Lusophone country Angola {{announced}} its forces would be ending the two-year-old Angolan Military Mission in Guinea <b>Bissau</b> (MISSANG) that followed a similar failed {{effort by the}} European Union {{as part of the}} United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS). State-owned Angolan news agency ANGOP said that the Angolan troops were sent to Guinea-Bissau in March 2011 in accordance with a bilateral military agreement to reform the armed forces. On 16 April, Guinea-Bissau Defense Minister Jorge Tolentino Araújo was scheduled to arrive in Angola to meet his counterpart Cândido Pereira dos Santos Van-Dúnem and the Army Chief-of-Staff Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda. He was also expected to visit the Higher Warfare School (ESG) and the Higher Technical Military Institute (ISTM). The same day as the coup, the two Lusophone countries of Angola and Cape Verde agreed to review their defense cooperation agreements. Presidential candidate and former Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Júnior was also unpopular with the army for his attempts to reform the institution.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Gulf War in 1990–91, {{when the}} Intifada's {{intensity}} began to wear down, Arafat supported Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and opposed the US-led coalition attack on Iraq. He made this decision {{without the consent}} of other leading members of Fatah and the PLO. Arafat's top aide Abu Iyad vowed to stay neutral and opposed an alliance with Saddam; On 17 January 1991, Abu Iyad was assassinated by the Abu Nidal Organization. Arafat's decision also severed relations with Egypt and many of the oil-producing Arab states that supported the US-led coalition. Many in the US also used Arafat's position as a reason to disregard his claims to being a partner for peace. After the end of hostilities, many Arab states that backed the coalition cut off funds to the PLO and began providing financial support for the organization's rival Hamas and other Islamist groups. Arafat narrowly escaped death again on 7 April 1992, when an Air <b>Bissau</b> aircraft he was a passenger on crash-landed in the Libyan Desert during a sandstorm. Two pilots and an engineer were killed; Arafat was bruised and shaken.|$|E
5|$|During late August {{and into}} early September 1961, an unusual series of {{low-level}} disturbances developed over Central and West Africa {{and into the}} eastern Atlantic Ocean. One of these systems, that probably formed over Central Africa {{at the end of}} August, became increasingly organized as it moved over Nigeria on September1. As the disturbance travelled steadily westward, its mid-level circulation became well defined, and the accompanying low-level centre gradually followed suit. An upper-level anticyclone accompanied the storm during this entire period, providing a favorable upper-air regime for strengthening. According to a post-storm study in 1962, all the necessary environmental ingredients were available to the disturbance while it was over land; the only factor inhibiting earlier development was a lack of access to the warm waters. Around 1200UTC on September5, the low emerged off the coast of Senegal as a strong tropical depression or tropical storm. By this time, the system had a central pressure below 1006mbar (hPa; 29.71inHg), and sustained winds of 35mph (55km/h) were reported in <b>Bissau,</b> Guinea-Bissau. As the system neared Cape Verde, it continued to intensify and by the evening of September6, reports from the nearby Danish tanker Charlotte Maersk indicated that the system was already at or near hurricane intensity.|$|E

25|$|Guinea-Bissau {{was once}} part {{of the kingdom of}} Gabu, as well as part of the Mali Empire. Parts of this kingdom persisted until the 18th century, while a few others were under some rule by the Portuguese Empire since the 16th century. In the 15th century, it was colonized as Portuguese Guinea. Upon independence, {{declared}} in 1973 and recognised in 1974, the name of its capital, <b>Bissau,</b> was added to the country's name to prevent confusion with Guinea (formerly French Guinea). Guinea-Bissau has a history of political instability since independence, and no elected president has successfully served a full five-year term.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the rivers}} and coast of this area {{were among the first}} places colonized by the Portuguese, who set up trading posts in the 16th century, they did not explore the {{interior}} until the 19th century. The local African rulers in Guinea, some of whom prospered greatly from the slave trade, controlled the inland trade and did not allow the Europeans into the interior. They kept them in the fortified coastal settlements where the trading took place. African communities that fought back against slave traders also distrusted European adventurers and would-be settlers. The Portuguese in Guinea were largely restricted to the ports of <b>Bissau</b> and Cacheu. A small number of European settlers established isolated farms along Bissau's inland rivers.|$|E

500|$|People {{began to}} venture {{out of their}} homes at dawn and there {{appeared}} to be little to no presence of soldiers on the streets and no messages over radio or television from either the government or the coup leaders. There was an [...] "unusual" [...] quiet in <b>Bissau,</b> although photographs showed a big hole in Gomes Júnior's residence {{as a result of the}} attack. Soldiers were seen standing guard outside radio and television stations, including the state-run television office, and the presidential offices in <b>Bissau.</b> An overnight curfew was imposed the following day with orders for the members of the civilian government to turn themselves over to the army. Private radio stations were also shut. On 14 April, some businesses started to reopen but they closed early in accordance with the curfew.|$|E
500|$|There {{were some}} small protests {{supporting}} Gomes Junior in downtown <b>Bissau,</b> although, according to Peter Thompson, soldiers arrested {{several of the}} protesters and put roadblocks on the streets. PAIGC, commenting on the transitional government, said that it [...] "rejects any anti-constitutional or anti-democratic proposal of {{a solution to the}} crisis," [...] while also calling for the release of those detained. Tensions mounted within PAIGC between factions supporting Gomes Junior and Nhamadjo. On 15 April, a demonstration of about 30 people at the National Assembly, where talks on a transition government were ongoing, was dispersed by soldiers. The National Union of Workers of Guinea-Bissau, which has a membership of about 8,000 mostly civil servants, called for a general strike the next day.|$|E
500|$|On 9 June, {{the last}} police and armed forces {{personnel}} of the MISSANG mission left the country. In late August, the Commissioner for Natural resources, Environment and Rural Development Ibraima Dieme announced the Union had approved a loan of 15 billion CFA francs {{to the country}} for security system reforms. However, the spokesman of the transitional government, Fernando Vaz, also announced that an agreement with Angola Bauxite to build a deepwater port so as to export bauxite {{would need to be}} renegotiated as [...] "the agreement signed in 2007 by the government of Carlos Gomes Junior is not fair...As a result, the terms of the agreement must be reviewed. The transitional government will not accept that <b>Bissau</b> receives 10 percent [...] while Angola Bauxite takes 90 percent." [...] The project, which had been inaugurated in July 2011, had previously stalled prior to the coup as a result of concern over political instability and an environmental impact study that had not yet been published despite passing the deadline. If completed the port at Buba would have a capacity to host three 70-tonne vessels at any given time, while the project as a whole would also lead {{to the creation of a}} three million tonne-a-year mine in Boe.|$|E

Anybody who has the proof, present it! We ask the international community to give us the means to fight drugs." [...] Gonzalez-Ducay then responded: [...] "I can't believe that the one who controls the drug trafficking is going to fight the drug trafficking." [...] The U.S. State Department's Foreign Service Officer for Guinea-Bissau Russell Hanks, who is not present in the country following the U.S. shutting its embassy during the Bissau-Guinean Civil War in 1998, said: [...] "You will only have an impact on this transition by engagement, not by isolation. These are the people who came in {{to pick up the pieces}} after the coup." [...] His staff pointed to photographs of newly created stretches of road in a remote rural area near the Senegal border that had space for small planes to land and they suggested was under the supervision of the armed forces. Chief of Guinea-Bissau's judicial police João Biague reported on a dubious aircraft landing months before the coup near Indjai's farm. He also added that [...] "The traffickers know [...] can't do much. The agents we have in the field want to give up because they have nothing to eat." [...] Guinea-Bissau's former prosecutor general added: [...] "A country that’s not capable of discussing its own problems — it's not a country, it's not a state." ...|$|E
