40|$|For masonry loaded in compression, the {{interaction}} between brick and mortar is of main interest. Tests showed that the deformation-properties of the mortar itself could be measured with ESPI. With the usual measuring techniques this {{turns out to be}} difficult as only small gauge lengths are applicable. This paper discusses the ESPI measuring technique and shows some of the effects of joint imperfections on the behaviour of masonry loaded in compression. Precise quantitative information about the deformation of brick and mortar separately was obtained. It may be concluded that the load is mainly transmitted through the central 60 to 70 mm of the specimen. ESPI measurements under various stages of testing confirm the linear behaviour of the specimen up to 80 % of failure load. The <b>bottom</b> <b>load</b> platen of the used moving seating arrangement had too much freedom of movement in relation to the bending stiffness of the specimen around the weak axes and caused unintended deformations.

30|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to build a chair resistant to force from front to back. To achieve this goal, poplar wood was treated with heat and steam, and then curved at an angle of 90 °. Curved frame was used for manufacturing chairs. In this study, three different designs of chairs were used. Control sample is a chair of custom type. The first design was a chair with a curved frame forming the structure back down to bottom (one-piece type) and the second design with two curved parts (two-piece type). Front to back load tests were conducted by mechanical universal testing machine in accordance with DIN EN 1729 - 2 standard. For each design, the test was repeated three times. The results of the experiment showed that differences between the designs were significant. The full type chairs were broken at the load about 1725  N, but the partial type chairs at about 1421  N. For the top to <b>bottom</b> <b>load</b> test, the full type chairs were broken at about 1052  N, other chairs were more resistant. In general, by introducing a design using the curved frame made of treated poplar, the resistance of chairs is improved.|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{pressure}} drop {{refers to the}} calculation of instantaneous {{pressure drop}} at each point through the crank rotation. The horsepower cost is computed by integrating the instantaneous pressure drop over a cylinder cycle. If the instantaneous velocity across a square law restriction {{is much higher than}} the mean velocity, then the cycle integrated horsepower cost will be much higher than the horsepower cost estimated by mean flow estimates. Field analyses have documented instances where dynamic pressure drop effects have incurred hundreds of excess horsepower and, in some cases, were so high as to inhibit full load operations. In one such case, strong cylinder interactions combined with a significant pressure drop restriction downstream of the compressor cylinder valves resulted in excessive horsepower losses. This paper presents a case study of a low-speed reciprocating compressor unit installed in a natural gas transmission service. On-site testing following start-up indicated total losses of approximately 55 percent of the indicated horsepower while operating on the <b>bottom</b> <b>load</b> step at rated speed.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the biomechanical effects of locking reconstruction plate positioning on the osteosynthesis of clavicle midshaft simulated transverse fractures. Material and Methods. Twelve synthetic clavicles with simulated midshaft transverse fractures were repaired with a 3. 5 -mm locking reconstruction plate in the anteroinferior or the superior position. The clavicles were randomly assigned to 2 groups (6 per group). Each repaired clavicle was tested in cantilever bending by using the universal testing machine. The maximal load and the displacement of the specimens at a load of 40 N were recorded for each group. Results. The anteroinferior plating osteosynthesis with a 3. 5 -mm locking reconstruction plate could bear an average maximal load of 183. 3 N (SD, 11. 3); the corresponding load for the superior plating osteosynthesis with the identical implants was 444. 8 N (SD, 102. 3), and the mean displacement was 1. 5 mm (SD, 0. 5) and 0. 7 mm (SD, 0. 2), respectively. Conclusions. The superior plating osteosynthesis of simulated midshaft transverse clavicle fractures with the 7 -hole 3. 5 -mm locking reconstruction plate had a significantly higher bending (from top to <b>bottom)</b> <b>load</b> to failure in comparison with the anteroinferior plating osteosynthesis of the clavicle with the identical implants.

40|$|Magellan spehrical {{harmonic}} {{gravity and}} topography models {{are used to}} estimate lithospheric properties at Alta Regio, Venus, a proposed hotspot with dynamic support from mantle plume(s). Global spherical harmonic and local representations of the gravity field share common properties in the Atla region interms of their spectral behavior over a wavelength band from approximately 2100 to approximately 700 km. The estimated free-air admittance spectrum displays a rather featureless long-wavelength portion followed by a sharp rise at wavelengths shorter than about 1000 km. This sharp rise requires significant flexural support of short-wavelength structures. The Bouguer coherence also displays {{a sharp drop in}} this wavelength band, indicating a finite flexural rigidity of the lithosphere. A simple model for lithospheric loading from above and below is introduced (D. W. Forsyth, 1985) with four parameters: f, the ratio of <b>bottom</b> <b>loading</b> to top loading; z(sub m), crustal thickness; z(sub l) depth to <b>bottom</b> <b>loading</b> source; and T(sub e) elastic lithosphere thickness. A dual-mode compensation model is introduced in which the shorter wavelengths (lambda approximately less than 1000 km) might be explained best by a predominance of top loading by the large shield volcanoes Maat Mons, Ozza Mons, and Sapas Mons, and the longer wavelengths (lambda approximately greater than 1500 km) might be explained best by a deep depth of compensation, possibly representing <b>bottom</b> <b>loading</b> by a dynamic source. A Monte Carlo inversion technique is introduced to thoroughly search out the four-space of the model parameters and to examine parameter correlation in the solutions.

40|$|The {{influence}} on soil erosion by different bedrock bareness ratios, different rainfall intensities, different underground pore fissure degrees and rainfall duration are researched through manual simulation of microrelief characteristics of karst bare slopes and underground karst crack construction {{in combination with}} artificial simulation of rainfall experiment. The results show that firstly, when the rainfall intensity is small (30 and 50 mm h − 1), no <b>bottom</b> <b>load</b> loss is produced on the surface, and surface runoff, underground runoff and sediment production are increased with the increasing of rainfall intensity. Secondly, surface runoff and sediment production reduced with increased underground pore fissure degree, while underground runoff and sediment production increased. Thirdly, raindrops hit the surface, forming a crust with rainfall duration. The formation of crusts increases surface runoff erosion and reduces soil infiltration rate. This formation also increases surface-runoff-erosion-damaged crust and increased soil seepage rate. Raindrops continued to hit the surface, leading the formation of crust. Soil permeability showed volatility which was from reduction to increases, reduction, and so on. Surface and subsurface runoff were volatile with rainfall duration. Fourthly, when rock bareness ratio is 50 % and rainfall intensities are 30 and 50 mm h − 1, runoff is not produced on the surface, and the slope runoff and sediment production present a fluctuating change with increased rock bareness ratio. Fifthly, the correlation degree between the slope runoff and sediment production and all factors are as follows: rainfall intensity-rainfall duration-underground pore fissure degree–bedrock bareness ratio...|$|E
40|$|Localized {{spectral}} admittances of {{the large}} Martian volcanoes are modeled by assuming that surface and subsurface loads are elastically supported by the lithosphere. In order to model the case where the load density {{differs from that of}} the crust, a new method for calculating gravity anomalies and lithospheric deflections is developed. The modeled gravity anomalies depend upon the elastic thickness, crustal thickness, load density, and crustal density, and these parameters were exhaustively sampled in order to determine their effect on the misfit between the observed and modeled admittance function. We find that the densities of the Martian volcanoes are generally well constrained with values of 3200 ± 100 kg m − 3, which is considerably greater than those reported previously. These higher densities are consistent with those of the Martian basaltic meteorites, which are believed to originate from the Tharsis and Elysium volcanic provinces. The crustal density is constrained only beneath the Elysium rise to be 3270 ± 150 kg m − 3. If this value is representative of the northern lowlands, then Pratt compensation is likely responsible for the approximately 6 -km elevation difference between the northern and southern hemispheres. The elastic thicknesses of the major Martian volcanoes (when subsurface loads are ignored) are found to be the following: Elysium rise (56 ± 20 km), Olympus Mons (93 ± 40 km), Alba Patera (66 ± 20 km), and Ascraeus Mons (105 ± 40 km). We have also investigated the effects of subsurface loads, allowing the <b>bottom</b> <b>load</b> to be located either in the crust as dense intrusive material or in the mantle as less dense material. We found that all volcanoes except Pavonis are better modeled with the presence of less dense material in the upper mantle, which is indicative of either a mantle plume or a depleted mantle composition. An active plume beneath the major volcanoes is consistent with recent analyses of cratering statistics on Olympus Mons and the Elysium rise, which indicate that some lava flows are as young as 10 – 30 Myr, {{as well as with the}} crystallization ages of the Shergottites, of which some are as young as 180 Myr...|$|E

The occupational hygiene measurements were made in two depots (one in northern Finland and the other in southern Finland) and in 11 service stations of a Finnish oil company during the loading and delivery of road tankers. Of the 21 measurements made, four were taken during top submerged loading of the road tankers and six during <b>bottom</b> <b>loading</b> at the depot. Eleven measurements were made during delivery at service stations. The duration of measurements varied from 10 to 44 min. The exposure of road tanker drivers to C 3 -C 11 hydrocarbons of gasoline was under 300 mg m~ 3 during <b>bottom</b> <b>loading</b> measurements and during top loading exceeded 300 mg m~ 3 two measurements (50 %). During delivery at service stations the exposure to C 3 -Cn hydrocarbons of gasoline exceeded 300 mg m~ 3 in four measurements (36 %).
