5|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{found that}} psychological therapy {{is effective in}} reducing self-harm. The proportion of the adolescents who self-harmed over the follow-up period was lower in the intervention groups (28%) than in controls (33%). Psychological therapies with the largest effect sizes were dialectical <b>behaviour</b> <b>therapy</b> (DBT), cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), and mentalization-based therapy (MBT).|$|E
5|$|There is no {{well-established}} {{treatment for}} self-injurious behaviour in children or adolescents. Cognitive behavioural therapy {{may also be}} used to assist those with Axis I diagnoses, such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Dialectical <b>behaviour</b> <b>therapy</b> (DBT) can be successful for those individuals exhibiting a personality disorder, and could potentially be used for those with other mental disorders who exhibit self-harming behaviour. Diagnosis and treatment of the causes of self-harm is thought {{by many to be the}} best approach to treating self-harm. But in some cases, particularly in people with a personality disorder, this is not very effective, so more clinicians are starting to take a DBT approach in order to reduce the behaviour itself. People who rely on habitual self-harm are sometimes hospitalised, based on their stability, their ability and especially their willingness to get help. In adolescents multisystem therapy shows promise. Treatments such as CBT, family intervention, interpersonal therapy, and various psychodynamic therapies were all shown to be possibly effective in treating self-injurious behaviour in children and adolescents.|$|E

40|$|Mental Retardation is a {{state of}} {{developmental}} deficit, beginning in childhood, resulting insignificant limitation of intellect or cognition and poor adaptation to the demands of everyday life. It is not always a disease but the consequence of some pathogenic process, resulting in a lifelong disability. Abundant research works are going on around the globe and a multidisciplinary approach incorporating different level of management strategies including the parent and the society is the primary option nowadays. Ayurvedic parlance is really a treasure of several therapeutic combinations advisable in conditions like Mental Retardation. Many drugs are being handled in clinical practise with positive claims. <b>Behaviour</b> modification <b>therapy</b> is a proven method capable of improving the overall performance of children with mental sub normalities, if performed with professional excellence. Ashtamangala gritha mentioned in baalaroga chikitsa in Bhaishajya ratnavali had been selected as study drug for this Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT). <b>Behaviour</b> modification <b>therapy</b> had been tried against its efficacy with the selected gritha as it is a proven therapy. The study was conducted with 40 subjects. The study group with Ashtamangala gritha along with <b>Behaviour</b> modification <b>therapy</b> was tried against the control with only <b>Behaviour</b> modification <b>therapy.</b> Assessment was done before treatment, after 30 days of treatment and after 30 days of follow up. The assessment was done using the Malin’s IQ Scale and Madras Development Programming System (MDPS) scoring. It was observed that Ashtamangala gritha has significant effect in the improving the IQ of children with Mental Retardation...|$|R

5000|$|Several concerns, both {{theoretical}} and empirical, have arisen {{in response to}} the ascendancy of ACT. One major theoretical concern is that the primary authors of ACT and of the corresponding theories of human behavior, relational frame theory (RFT) and functional contextualism (FC), recommend their approach as the proverbial holy grail of psychological therapies. Psychologist James C. Coyne, in a discussion of [...] "disappointments and embarrassments in the branding of psychotherapies as evidence supported", said: [...] "Whether or not ACT is more efficacious than other therapies, as its proponents sometimes claim, or whether it is efficacious for psychosis, is debatable". The textbook Systems of Psychotherapy: A Transtheoretical Analysis provides criticisms of third-wave <b>behaviour</b> <b>therapies</b> including ACT from the perspectives of other systems of psychotherapy.|$|R
25|$|By using CBT people record {{how much}} food they eat and periods of {{vomiting}} {{with the purpose}} of identifying and avoiding emotional fluctuations that bring on episodes of bulimia on a regular basis. Barker (2003) states that research has found 40–60% of people using cognitive <b>behaviour</b> <b>therapy</b> to become symptom free. He states in order for the therapy to work, all parties must work together to discuss, record and develop coping strategies. Barker (2003) claims by making people aware of their actions they will think of alternatives. People undergoing CBT who exhibit early behavioral changes are most likely to achieve the best treatment outcomes in the long run. Researchers have also reported some positive outcomes for interpersonal psychotherapy and dialectical behavior therapy.|$|E

2500|$|Individual {{therapy with}} the child seeks to {{identify}} and resolve underlying factors, including familial factors; encourage identification by sex assigned at birth; and encourage same-sex friendships. Parent counseling involves setting limits on the child's cross-gender behavior; encouraging gender-neutral or sex-typical activities; examining familial factors; and examining parental factors such as psychopathology. Longtime researchers of gender identity disorder, Kenneth Zucker and Susan Bradley, state {{that it has been}} found that boys with gender identity disorder often have mothers who to an extent reinforced behavior more stereotypical of young girls. They also note that children with gender identity disorder tend to come from families where cross-gender role behavior was not explicitly discouraged. However, they also acknowledge that one could view these findings as merely indicative of the fact that parents who were more accepting of their child's cross-gender role behavior {{are also more likely to}} bring their children to a clinical psychiatrist as opposed to parents who are less accepting of cross-gender role behavior in their children (Bradley, Zucker, 1997). [...] " [...] Proponents acknowledge limited data on GIDC: [...] "apart from a series of intrasubject <b>behaviour</b> <b>therapy</b> case reports from the 1970s, one will find not a single randomized controlled treatment trial in the literature" [...] (Zucker 2001). Psychiatrist Domenico Di Ceglie opines that for therapeutic intervention, [...] "efficacy is unclear," [...] and psychologist Bernadette Wren says, [...] "There is little evidence, however, that any psychological treatments have much effect in changing gender identity although some treatment centres continue to promote this as an aim (e.g. Zucker, & Bradley, 1995)." [...] Zucker has stated that [...] "the therapist must rely on the 'clinical wisdom' that has accumulated and to utilize largely untested case formulation conceptual models to inform treatment approaches and decisions." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Behaviour</b> <b>therapy</b> {{is a broad}} term {{referring}} to psychotherapy, behaviour analytical, {{or a combination of}} the two therapies. In its broadest sense, the methods focus on either just behaviours or in combination with thoughts and feelings that might be causing them. Those who practice <b>behaviour</b> <b>therapy</b> tend to look more at specific, learned behaviours and how the environment influences those behaviours. Those who practice <b>behaviour</b> <b>therapy</b> are called behaviourists. They tend to look for treatment outcomes that are objectively measurable. <b>Behaviour</b> <b>therapy</b> does not involve one specific method but it has a wide range of techniques that can be used to treat a person's psychological problems. <b>Behaviour</b> <b>therapy</b> breaks down into four disciplines: applied behaviour analysis (ABA), the teaching-family model (TFM), positive behavior support (PBS) and cognitive <b>behaviour</b> <b>therapy</b> (CBT). ABA focuses on the application of learning theory to assess potential behaviour-change procedures and CBT focuses on the thoughts and feelings behind mental health conditions with treatment plans in psychotherapy to lessen the issue.|$|E

For performing this study, 20 students with test anxiety have been chosen by cluster sampling method after a diagnostic test(Test Anxiety Inventory, TAI). Then, they have assigned to experiment and control group equally (10 person). The experiment group received cognitive behaviour modification for 8 sessions, but the control group didn’t. The data was analyzed by Quvariance test. Results: Results show that the test anxiety symptoms reduced significantly in experiment group in comparison to control group.
