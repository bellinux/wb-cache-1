5|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} quality and craft {{that went into the}} compilation's design. Jaz Rignall (USgamer) was {{impressed}} by the compilation's presentation and balance between frills and efficiency, and Dan Whitehead (Eurogamer) felt that the theatrical theme fit Rare's character. Reviewers considered Rare Replay a high-water mark for video game compilations—Kotaku called it the best since Valve's The Orange <b>Box.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, Jeremy Parish (USgamer) found the contemporaneous Mega Man Legacy Collection Criterion Collection-style presentation to be a more authentic appreciation of its original material. Chris Plante (The Verge) saw Rare Replay slight hardware improvements and added touches as a viable model for putting retrogames back on the market and slowing the tide of unlicensed downloads.|$|E
5|$|The {{gear and}} dial {{in the bottom}} left of the game screen {{is related to the}} Kotarou's Rewrite ability. The dial moves forward {{whenever}} this ability is used, and the outcome of certain scenes is determined by how much the dial has moved.

5|$|This is {{the first}} series to feature Matt Smith as the {{eleventh}} incarnation of the Doctor, an alien Time Lord who travels through time and space in his TARDIS, {{which appears to be}} a British police <b>box</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside. Karen Gillan is also introduced as the Doctor's new companion Amy Pond, with her fiancé Rory Williams portrayed by Arthur Darvill, who is in seven episodes, and travels with the Doctor and Amy and is also a regular in the next series. Alex Kingston returns as River Song, a mysterious woman from the Doctor's future who summons the Doctor twice in this series. The main story arc concerns a pattern of cracks in the universe which appear over several episodes, sometimes going unnoticed by the characters. It is discovered that they have the power to erase things from existence, and this happens to Rory, causing Amy to forget him. In the series finale it is revealed that the cracks were caused by the TARDIS exploding and the Doctor is forced to reboot the universe to the state which it was in without the cracks.|$|E
