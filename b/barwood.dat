Real-life ARP technician Phil Dodds cameos as the operator of the ARP 2500 synthesizer communicating with the alien ship. Musician Jerry Garcia also makes an {{appearance in}} the crowd scene.

5|$|Lamhamedi also {{competed in}} the slalom on 22 February. In his first run, he {{finished}} in 51st position {{with a time of}} 54.47 seconds, directly behind Adam <b>Barwood</b> from New Zealand (54.21 seconds) and ahead of Bosnia and Herzegovina's Igor Laikert (54.68 seconds). However, Lamhamedi failed to complete his second run, and so ended the slalom competition without a final position.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of the game, a story for a {{supposed}} successor in the adventure genre was conceived by Joe Pinney, Hal <b>Barwood,</b> Bill Stoneham, and Aric Wilmunder. Titled Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix, it was set after World War II and featured Nazis seeking refuge in Bolivia, trying to resurrect Adolf Hitler with the philosophers' stone. The game was in development for 15 months before it was showcased at the European Computer Trade Show.|$|E
500|$|The package {{illustration}} for Fate of Atlantis {{was inspired}} by the Indiana Jones movie posters of Drew Struzan. It was drawn by Eaken within three days, following disagreements with the marketing department and an external art director over which concept to use. Clint Bajakian, Peter McConnell and Michael Land created the soundtrack for the game, arranging John Williams' main theme [...] "The Raiders March" [...] for a variety of compositions. The DOS version uses sequenced music played back by either an internal speaker, the FM synthesis of an AdLib or Sound Blaster sound card, or the sample-based synthesis of a Roland MT-32 sound module. During development of the game, William Messner-Loebs and Dan Barry wrote a Dark Horse Comics series based on <b>Barwood's</b> and Falstein's story, then titled Indiana Jones and the Keys to Atlantis. In an interview, Eaken mentioned hour-long meetings of the development team {{trying to come up with}} a better title than Fate of Atlantis, though the staff members could never think of one and always ended up with names such as [...] "Indiana Jones Does Atlantis". The final title was <b>Barwood's</b> idea, who first had to convince the company's management and the marketing team not to simply call the game [...] "Indy's Next Adventure".|$|R
5|$|However, {{when the}} German coordinators {{discovered}} how extensively the game dealt with Neo-Nazism, they informed LucasArts {{about the difficulty}} of marketing the game in their country. As Germany was an important overseas market for adventure games, LucasArts feared that the lower revenues would not recoup development costs, and subsequently canceled the game. The plot was later adapted into a four-part Dark Horse Comics series by Lee Marrs, published monthly from December 1994 to March 1995. In an interview, <b>Barwood</b> commented that the development team should have thought about the story more thoroughly beforehand, calling it insensitive and not regretting the cancellation of the title.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} Indiana Jones {{universe}} and revolves around the eponymous protagonist's global search for the legendary sunken city of Atlantis. Sophia Hapgood, an old co-worker of Indiana Jones who gave up her archaeological career to become a psychic, supports him along the journey. The two partners are pursued by the Nazis who seek to use the power of Atlantis for warfare, and serve as the adventure's antagonists. The story was written by Hal <b>Barwood</b> and Noah Falstein, the game's designers, who had rejected the original plan to base it on an unused movie script. They came up with the final concept while researching real-world sources for a suitable plot device.|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{features}} a four-minute long animated opening credit sequence, the first LucasArts game to have such. Ahern noted that their previous games would run the credits over primarily still shots which would only {{last for a}} few minutes, but with Tentacle, the team had grown so large that they worried this approach would be boring to players. They assigned Kyle Balda, an intern at CalArts, to create the animated sequence, with Chan helping to create minimalist backgrounds {{to aid in the}} animation. Originally this sequence was around seven minutes long, and included the three characters arriving at the mansion and releasing Purple Tentacle. Another LucasArts designer, Hal <b>Barwood,</b> suggested they cut it in half, leading to the shortened version as in the released game, and having the player take over when they arrive at the mansion.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Streisand's <b>Barwood</b> Films, Gary Smith, and Sonny Murray {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} Simon Mawer's book Mendel's Dwarf. In December 2008, she stated that she was considering directing an adaptation of Larry Kramer's play The Normal Heart, a project she has worked on since the mid-1990s.|$|E
25|$|Following this, {{the games}} {{branched}} off into original storylines with Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb and Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings. Emperor's Tomb sets up Jones's companion Wu Han {{and the search}} for Nurhaci's ashes seen at the beginning of Temple of Doom. The first two games were developed by Hal <b>Barwood</b> and starred Doug Lee as the voice of Indiana Jones; Emperor's Tomb had David Esch fill the role and Staff of Kings starred John Armstrong.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{three groups of}} movie makers were {{developing}} Pollock biographical projects, each based on a different source. The project that at first seemed most advanced was {{a joint venture between}} Barbra Streisand's <b>Barwood</b> Films and Robert De Niro's TriBeCa Productions (De Niro's parents were friends of Krasner and Pollock). The script, by Christopher Cleveland, was to be based on Jeffrey Potter's 1985 oral biography, To a Violent Grave, a collection of reminiscences by Pollock's friends. Streisand was {{to play the role of}} Lee Krasner, and De Niro was to portray Pollock. A second was to be based on Love Affair (1974), a memoir by Ruth Kligman, who was Pollock's lover in the six months before his death. This was to be directed by Harold Becker, with Al Pacino playing Pollock.|$|E
500|$|Once <b>Barwood</b> and Falstein {{completed}} the rough {{outline of the}} story, <b>Barwood</b> wrote the actual script, and the team began to conceive the puzzles and to design the environments. The Atlantean artifacts and architecture devised by lead artist William Eaken were made to resemble those of the Minoan civilization, while the game in turn implies that the Minoans were inspired by Atlantis. <b>Barwood</b> intended for the Atlantean art to have an [...] "alien" [...] feel to it, with the machines seemingly operating on as yet unknown physics rather than on magic. The majority of the 256-color backgrounds in the game were mostly mouse-drawn with Deluxe Paint, though roughly ten percent were paintings scanned {{at the end of}} the development cycle. As a consequence of regular design changes, the images often had to be revised by the artists. Character animations were fully rotoscoped with video footage of Steve Purcell for Indiana's and Collette Michaud for Sophia's motions. The main art team that consisted of Eaken, James Dollar and Avril Harrison was sometimes consulted by <b>Barwood</b> to help out with the more graphical puzzles in the game, such as a broken robot in Atlantis.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} a sequel to [...] was decided, most of the staff of Lucasfilm Games was {{occupied}} with other projects such as The Secret of Monkey Island and The Dig. Designer Hal <b>Barwood</b> had only created two computer games on his own before, but {{was put in charge}} of the project because of his experience as a producer and writer of feature films. The company originally wanted him to create a game based on Indiana Jones and the Monkey King/Garden of Life, a rejected script written by Chris Columbus for the third movie that would have seen Indiana looking for Chinese artifacts in Africa. However, after reading the script <b>Barwood</b> decided that the idea was substandard, and requested to create an original story for the game instead. Along with co-worker Noah Falstein, he visited the library of George Lucas' workplace Skywalker Ranch to look for possible plot devices. They eventually decided upon Atlantis when they looked at a diagram in [...] "some cheap coffee-table book on the world's unsolved mysteries", which depicted the city as built in three concentric circles. Falstein and <b>Barwood</b> originally considered the mythical sword Excalibur as the story's plot device, but the idea was scrapped because it wouldn't have easily given Indiana Jones a reason to go anywhere except England.|$|E
500|$|Close Encounters was a long-cherished {{project for}} Spielberg. In late 1973, he {{developed}} a deal with Columbia Pictures for a science fiction film. Though Spielberg received sole credit for the script, he was assisted by Paul Schrader, John Hill, David Giler, Hal <b>Barwood,</b> Matthew Robbins, and Jerry Belson, all of whom contributed to the screenplay in varying degrees. The title is derived from Ufologist J. Allen Hynek's classification of close encounters with aliens, in which the third kind denotes human observations of aliens or [...] "animate beings." [...] Douglas Trumbull served as the visual effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi designed the aliens.|$|E
500|$|While {{the deal}} was {{initially}} for a [...] "one-week dialogue polish", Gottlieb eventually became the primary screenwriter, rewriting the entire script during a nine-week period of principal photography. The script for each scene was typically finished the night before it was shot, after Gottlieb had dinner with Spielberg {{and members of the}} cast and crew to decide what would go into the film. Many pieces of dialogue originated from the actors' improvisations during these meals; a few were created on set, most notably Roy Scheider's ad-lib of the line [...] "You're gonna need a bigger boat." [...] John Milius contributed dialogue polishes, and Sugarland Express writers Matthew Robbins and Hal <b>Barwood</b> also made uncredited contributions. Spielberg has claimed that he prepared his own draft, although it is unclear to what degree the other screenwriters drew on his material. One specific alteration he called for in the story was to change the cause of the shark's death from extensive wounds to a scuba tank explosion, as he felt audiences would respond better to a [...] "big rousing ending". The director estimated the final script had a total of 27 scenes that were not in the book.|$|E
500|$|The {{addition}} {{of three different}} paths was suggested by Falstein and added about six more months of development time, mainly {{because of all the}} extra dialogue that had to be implemented for the interaction between Indiana and Sophia. Altogether, the game took around two years to finish, starting in early 1990, and lasting up to the floppy disk release in June 1992. The only aspect <b>Barwood</b> was not involved in at all was the production of voices for the enhanced [...] "talkie" [...] edition released on CD-ROM in May 1993, which was instead handled by Tamlynn Barra. The voice-over recordings for the approximately 8000 lines of dialogue took about four weeks, and were done with actors from the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. Harrison Ford was not available to record Indiana Jones's voice, so a substitute actor Doug Lee was used. The [...] "talkie" [...] version was later included as an extra game mode in the Wii version of the 2009 action game Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings, and distributed via the digital content delivery software Steam as a port for Windows XP, Windows Vista and Mac OS X that same year. The versions on the Wii and available on Steam have improved MIDI versions of the soundtrack, along with both voices and text.|$|E
500|$|David Giler {{performed}} a rewrite; Hal <b>Barwood</b> and Matthew Robbins, friends of Spielberg, suggested the plot device of a kidnapped child. Spielberg {{then began to}} write the script. The song [...] "When You Wish upon a Star" [...] from Pinocchio influenced Spielberg's writing style. [...] "I hung my story on the mood the song created, the way it affected me personally." [...] Jerry Belson and Spielberg wrote the shooting script together. In the end, Spielberg was given solo writing credit. During pre-production, the title was changed from Kingdom Come to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. J. Allen Hynek, who worked with the United States Air Force on Project Blue Book, {{was hired as a}} scientific consultant. Hynek felt [...] "even though the film is fiction, it's based for the most part on the known facts of the UFO mystery, and it certainly catches the flavor of the phenomenon. Spielberg was under enormous pressure to make another blockbuster after Jaws, but he decided to make a UFO movie. He put his career on the line." [...] USAF and NASA declined to cooperate on the film. In fact, NASA reportedly sent a 20-page letter to Spielberg, telling him that releasing the film was dangerous. In an interview, he said: [...] "I really found my faith when I heard that the Government was opposed to the film. If NASA took the time to write me a 20-page letter, then I knew there must be something happening." ...|$|E
2500|$|Streisand {{produced}} {{a number of}} her own films, setting up <b>Barwood</b> Films in 1972. For Yentl (1983), she was producer, director, and star, an experience she repeated for The Prince of Tides (1991) and The Mirror Has Two Faces (1996). There was controversy when Yentl received five Academy Award nominations, but none for the major categories of Best Picture, Actress, or Director. The Prince of Tides received even more Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Screenplay, although not for director. Upon completion of the film, its screenwriter, Pat Conroy, who also authored the novel, called Streisand [...] "a goddess who walks upon the earth." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Lucas {{recruited}} many conceptual designers, including Colin Cantwell, {{who worked}} on [...] (1968), to conceptualize the initial spacecraft models; Alex Tavoularis to create the preliminary conceptual storyboard sketches of early scripts; and Ralph McQuarrie to visualize the characters, costumes, props and scenery. McQuarrie's pre-production paintings of certain scenes from Lucas's early screenplay drafts helped 20th Century Fox visualize the film, which positively influenced their decision to fund the project. After McQuarrie's drawings for Lucas's colleagues Hal <b>Barwood</b> and Matthew Robbins (who were collaborating for a film) caught his interest, Lucas met with McQuarrie to discuss {{his plans for the}} then-untitled space fantasy film he wanted to make. Two years later, after completing American Graffiti, Lucas approached McQuarrie and asked him if he would be interested [...] "in doing something for Star Wars." [...] McQuarrie produced a series of artworks from simple sketches; these set a visual tone for the film, {{and for the rest of}} the original trilogy.|$|E
6000|$|The Gaboon {{trade is}} chronicled by John Barbot, Agent-General of the French West African Company, [...] "Description of the Coast of South Guinea," [...] Churchill, vol. v. book iv. chap. 9; {{and the chief}} items were, and still are, ivory and beeswax. Of the former, 90,000 lbs. may be {{exported}} when the home prices are good, and sometimes the total has reached 100 tons. Hippopotamus tusks are dying out, being now worth only 2s. per lb. Other exports are caoutchouc, ebony (of which the best comes from the Congo), and camwood or <b>barwood</b> (a Tephrosia). M. du Chaillu calls it the [...] "Ego-tree;" [...] the natives (Mpongwe) name the tree Igo, and the billet Ezígo.|$|E
60|$|The {{natives of}} Africa have a {{singular}} and very bad style of carrying on {{trade with the}} white men who visit their shores. The traffic consists chiefly of ivory, <b>barwood</b> (a wood much used in dyeing), and indiarubber. The natives of the far interior {{are not allowed to}} convey these commodities directly to the coast, but by {{the law of the land}} (which means the law of the strongest, for they are absolute savages) are obliged to deliver their goods to the care of the tribe next to them; these pass them on to the next tribe; and so on they go from tribe to tribe till they reach the coast, where they are sold by the tribe there. The price obtained, which usually consists of guns, powder and shot, looking-glasses, cloth, and sundry other articles and trinkets useful to men in a savage state, is returned to the owners in the far interior through the same channel; but as each tribe deducts a percentage for its trouble, the price dwindles down as it goes, until a mere trifle, sometimes nothing at all, remains to be handed over to the unfortunate people of the tribe who originally sent off the goods for sale. Of course, such a system almost paralyses trade. But the intermediate tribes between the coast and the interior being the gainers by this system, are exceedingly jealous of anything like an attempt to carry on direct trade. They are ready to go to war with the tribes of the interior, should they attempt it, and they throw all the opposition they can in the way of the few white men who ever penetrate the interior for such a purpose.|$|E
50|$|After Close Encounters, <b>Barwood</b> and Robbins collaborated {{again for}} the fantasy film Dragonslayer, {{starring}} Peter MacNicol, in which <b>Barwood</b> not only co-wrote. Dragonslayer was released in 1981 and received good reviews and despite its mediocre box office performance, it has became a cult classic.|$|E

50|$|Infernal Machine project leader, {{designer}} and writer Hal <b>Barwood</b> {{always thought of}} Indiana Jones as an action hero. Based on this notion, he decided for the game to be an action-adventure, as he was particularly fond of the genre and its use of 3D worlds. <b>Barwood</b> also considered the Nazis to be overused as villains in the series and so instead set the title in the Cold War era with Russians as the antagonists. Originally, UFOs were planned {{to be used as}} a plot device, though George Lucas vetoed the idea, still reserving it for a then undeveloped fourth movie. In lieu thereof, <b>Barwood</b> became interested in ancient technology like the Antikythera mechanism, conceived the Infernal Machine as the MacGuffin, and placed it in the biblical Tower of Babel, which is believed to be identical with the Etemenanki, a temple dedicated to the god Marduk.|$|E

After Yoda Stories, <b>Barwood</b> returned to make another Indiana Jones game. His original idea was to use the Roswell UFO incident as the story's plot device, but George Lucas prevented him from doing this, so he opted to make a new story. The game became Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, in which Indiana Jones, along with Sophia Hapgood, want to find the Infernal Machine, a mythological Babylonian power source, before the Soviets could do it. Infernal Machine, as being the series' first 3D installment video game, was released in 1999 and became a success like Fate of Atlantis.
