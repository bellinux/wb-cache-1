50|$|Non-performing assets {{had been}} the single largest cause of {{irritation}} of the banking sector of India. Earlier the Narasimham Committee-I had broadly concluded that {{the main reason for}} the reduced profitability of the commercial banks in India was the priority sector lending. The committee had highlighted that 'priority sector lending' was leading to the buildup of non-performing assets of the banks and thus it recommended it to be phased out. Subsequently, the Narasimham Committee-II also highlighted the need for 'zero' non-performing assets for all Indian banks with International presence. The 1998 report further blamed poor credit decisions, behest-lending and cyclical economic factors among other reasons for the buildup of the non-performing assets of these banks to uncomfortably high levels. The Committee recommended creation of Asset Reconstruction Funds or Asset Reconstruction Companies to take over the bad debts of banks, allowing them to start on a clean-slate. The option of recapitalisation through <b>budgetary</b> <b>provisions</b> was ruled out. Overall the committee wanted a proper system to identify and classify NPAs, NPAs to be brought down to 3% by 2002 and for an independent loan review meachnism for improved management of loan portfolios.The committee's recommendations let to introduction of a new legislation which was subsequently implemented as the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 and came into force with effect from 21 June 2002.|$|E

30|$|The {{approach}} to strategy and external threats is to stage internal workshops, use embedded expertise in scenario analysis, ‘stress test’ the plans {{not only in}} the business-as-usual context but also for when things are unusual, and supplement with independent review. Strategy and external threats are poorly quantifiable, so they are uncertainties rather than risks. On most projects the ESIAs, environmental authorizations, ESMPs and day-to-day management poorly cover strategy and external threats. Managing the project affected people on LHWP is an exception. Hundreds of households were relocated, water and sanitation programs instituted, living standards maintained, and advice given on investing compensation payments, not without shortcomings and failings, but with policy formulation, planning, <b>budgetary</b> <b>provision,</b> diligent implementation and learning from experience. On other projects, building a fish barrier is done better than relocating displaced land dwellers, culvert design for a new road takes precedence over possible destroyed livelihoods that the road could cause, and a behind-schedule project does not have time to take flood protection precautions and so slips further when flood occurs.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the factors that}} influence whether strategies for preventing and treating malaria in pregnancy are successfully translated into national policy and programme implementation, and identifies key operational research issues. Countries require guidance on how to assess the effectiveness of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in the context of increasing sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. At the same time, data on the safety and efficacy of alternatives to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for prevention and treatment are urgently needed. Systematic examination of the cultural and operational constraints to delivery and uptake of IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and use of insecticide-treated nets would provide a rational basis for strategies aimed at improving coverage. Standardised methodology must be used to monitor IPTp coverage and to compare different approaches for scaling-up the delivery of insecticide-treated nets to pregnant women. Adequate <b>budgetary</b> <b>provision</b> for the implementation of policy and for operational research to improve programme delivery should be included in national applications to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The provision of clear policy guidance on malaria in pregnancy and its translation into evidence-based guidelines that are made widely available at a country level are central to improving malaria control in this particularly vulnerable group...|$|R

When records are poorly managed, much time is involved in sorting and locating needed information from large volumes of records. The rate of records misplaced or lost from which useful information for decision making is usually obtained makes it difficult to provide concise and up-to-date records of both past and present operations, raising the challenge of effective record-keeping. Thus this study examined records management practices in selected local government councils in Ogun State, Nigeria, adopting the descriptive survey research method using questionnaires for data collection. Its population comprised 415 records of personnel in the selected councils, of which 208 were sampled using simple random technique. From the 208 copies of the questionnaire administered on the registry personnel, 150 copies were useable, with a 72. 12 % response rate. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis. The results indicated a prevalence of paper as the dominant medium for recording/conveying information in the councils with most of these being either in active state, semi-active, and vital and were kept and maintained in the registry, while in-active records were kept in the records store.
