She pretends to be a child, but others notice that she is different. The Bene Gesserit are eventually outraged and horrified by Alia's existence, but she is out of their control. Mohiam says, [...] "I've said too much, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> <b>that</b> this child {{who is not a}} child must be destroyed. Long were we warned against such a one and how to prevent such a birth, but one of our own has betrayed us." [...] In Children of Dune, an adult Alia eventually succumbs to the ancestral ego of her grandfather, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, who wants nothing more than the destruction of the Atreides, and is given another opportunity, from the inside, to realize it.|$|E
2500|$|At present reuse {{of urine}} as a {{fertilizer}} in the United States {{is still in}} the conceptual phase. Studies into its feasibility are currently underway in Brattleboro, Vermont, and are being conducted by the not-for-profit Rich Earth Institute. Perhaps accordingly, a quick review of the pertinent regulations in existence in several different states turns up zero mentions of [...] "urine diversion" [...] and zero mentions of urine specifically as a standalone material which requires distinct oversight. Instead, when it is mentioned, it is always in conjunction with feces (as in the contents of a composting toilet or other non-source separating dry toilet type.

2500|$|In 2015, a Tumblr post from user virjn {{generated}} media controversy, as it claimed Green is [...] "a creep who panders to {{teenage girls}} {{so that he}} can amass some weird cult-like following." [...] Other users commented on the post, criticizing his writing and tagging Green to bring the post to his attention. Green responded to the post, defending himself, stating, [...] "Throwing that kind of accusation around is sick and libelous and most importantly damages the discourse around the actual sexual abuse of children." [...] Green added that he would use the social media website less often, stating, [...] "I'm not angry or anything like that. I just need some distance for my well-being." [...] Fellow young-adult authors, Rainbow Rowell and Maggie Stiefvater came to Green's defense. Stiefvater wrote on Tumblr, [...] "You can have your own opinions on Green's books and Internet presence, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> <b>that</b> he is a very real positive influence on thousands of teens. You're not just making sure you can't have nice things. You're taking away other people's nice things." [...] In a subsequent email to USA Today, Stiefvater stated, [...] "I had to say something.

2500|$|Wanrong wore a mask in {{accordance}} with Chinese tradition and Puyi, who knew nothing of women, remembered: [...] "I hardly thought about marriage and family. It was only when the Empress came into my field of vision with a crimson satin cloth embroidered with a dragon and a phoenix over her head that I felt at all curious about what she looked like." [...] After the wedding was complete, Puyi, Wanrong, and his secondary consort Wenxiu (whom he married the same night) went to the Palace of Earthly Tranquility, where everything was red [...] the color of love and sex in China [...] and where emperors had traditionally consummated their marriages. Puyi, who was sexually inexperienced and timid, fled from the bridal chamber, leaving his wives {{to sleep in the}} Dragon Bed by themselves. About Puyi's failure to consummate his marriage on his wedding night, Behr wrote:It was perhaps too much to expect an adolescent, permanently surrounded by eunuchs to show the sexual maturity of a normal seventeen year-old. Neither the Dowager consorts nor Johnston himself had given him any advice on sexual matters [...] this sort of thing simply was not done, where emperors were concerned: It would have been an appalling breach of protocol. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> <b>that</b> a totally inexperienced, over-sheltered adolescent, if normal, could hardly have failed to be aroused by Wan Jung's [...] unusual, sensual beauty.

40|$|The role {{of women}} in African economies is more {{emphasised}} in recent years by ensuring gender equality and women empowerment. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> as women have less access to resources, education and health facilities in most of the developing countries.

The picture is same in Eritrea, which became independence recently, with low levels of women education and their participation in the economy. An attempt is made in this paper to analyse women participation in economic activities in Africa in general and Eritrea in particular. The paper also provides some policy measures seeking higher participation of women in Eritrean economy. ...|$|R
