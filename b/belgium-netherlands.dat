40|$|Eutrophication of {{the coastal}} waters results in algal blooms which may be harmful to the marine {{ecosystem}} and coastal economy. The main sources of nutrients are the rivers but an unquantified amount of nitrogen is also transported from ground sources via the atmosphere and deposited to the sea directly by rain and turbulent diffusion. A Lagrangian Particle Dispersion (LPD) model based on the open source code FLEXPART ([URL] is described that quantifies the dissolved nitrogen coming from {{the air in the}} English Channel and Southern North Sea (the ‘ 2 Seas’ geographical region). The model uses meteorological records, emissions data and LPD computations to simulate the motion and deposition of nitrogen compounds. The emission sources contributing to the deposition are individually identified, and calculated concentrations are compared with ground measurements in selected locations. The highest calculated atmospheric depositions to the sea in the considered region are found to be along the <b>Belgium–Netherlands</b> coast...|$|E
40|$|The tidally {{resolved}} mass {{conservation equation}} of solutes in a Eulerian reference frame is transformed {{to a new}} reference frame, which oscillates with the tide so as to maintain constant upstream volume. This transformation is mathematically transparent and removes almost all the tidal harmonics, which {{are present in the}} original solution. Tidal harmonics make the direct time integration in a Eulerian frame difficult. In contrast, after coordinate transformation, it is straightforward to derive an approximate time-average solute equation through the application of a time-smoothing operator. Using a simple model, it is demonstrated that the transient solute dynamics in the new, oscillating reference frame is a smooth function of time. As a result, the Reynolds rules for time averaging can readily be applied in the new frame and it is shown that the resulting solute equation, which describes the long-term solute dynamics, is indeed a very good approximation to the instantaneous, tidally resolved, mass conservation equation. The practical implementation of the time-smoothing operator is illustrated {{in the case of a}} real estuary, the Western Scheldt (<b>Belgium-Netherlands)</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Estuaries are obligate {{pathways}} for {{the transfer}} of dissolved and particulate material from the continent to the marine system. The tidal regime of some estuaries leads to an increased residence time of the freshwater in the estuarine mixing zone and pronounced changes in the speciation of elements. European estuaries are subject to intense anthropogenic disturbance reflected in elevated loading of detrital organic matter, which induce high respiration rates {{and the production of}} large quantities of dissolved CO 2. The Scheldt basin covers one of the most populated and industrialised areas of Europe and its tributaries drain an area of about 21, 860 km 2. The amounts of nutrients discharged by the Scheldt increased considerably during the past 20 years. Due to the dilution and metabolic processes of the downstream river flow in the estuary, an important variability of several parameters can be observed amongst which phytoplankton species and concentration, particulate organic matter, colour dissolved organic matter and suspended matter. In the present days, researches on the functioning of estuarine and coastal ecosystems are based on highly time consuming, costly sea campaigns and laboratory analyses. Although optical spaceborne remote sensing already proved useful in such coastal ecosystems studies, hyperspectroscopy opened a new dimension by allowing improved distinction of various biogeochemical compounds through characteristic spectral signature identification. The goal of this research is to explore the potential of CASI-SWIR airborne hyperspectroscopy in retrieving some of the biogeochemical parameters of interest in the Schedlt estuary and plume (<b>Belgium-Netherlands</b> coastal zone). A 13 sampling stations field survey was realised in order to cover as quickly as possible the wide range of water quality encountered {{from the mouth of the}} estuary to the outer limit of the plume. The numerous parameters and spectrum measured in each station were used for further remote sensing analysis, as well as to complete the interpretation of the observed environmental processes. Correlation was searched between classical ground truth measurements and the rich information provided by numerous CASI-SWIR spectral bands carefully chosen. These relations were used as an attempt to derive synoptic view of the spatial distribution of various biogeochemical parameters in the Scheldt estuary and plume. Synthesis of these hyperspectral-mapping products with other complementary satellite maps and ground data set may allow ocean scientists to derive substantial information about ecosystem processes in the Scheldt estuary and adjacent coast...|$|E
40|$|Preface: Technology on October 29 and 30, 2009, {{under the}} auspices of the <b>Belgium-Netherlands</b> Association for Artificial Intelligence (BNVKI) and the Dutch Research School for Information and Knowledge Systems (SIKS). The term 2 ̆ 2 Artificial Intelligence 2 ̆ 2 dates back to 1956 when John McCarthy defined it as 2 ̆ 2 the science and {{engineering}} of making intelligent machines. 2 ̆ 2 Even though nowadays we are still far from building machines that can pass the infamous Turing test (Turing, Mind, 59 (236), 1950), Artificial intelligence is a very lively research area in the Benelux, with a lot of internationally active and renown research groups in, among others, multi-agent systems and simulation, games, logics in AI, machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, semantic web, evolutionary computing. The main goals of BNAIC are two-fold: on the one hand to bring together AI researchers in the Benelux to meet and present research activities with oral and poster presentations, and on the other hand to present high-quality research results, possibly already published in international conferences or journals, complemented with renown international keynote speakers. The format of BNAIC is therefore a mixture of a meeting place and a forum for high-quality research results, forming a balance that has proven to be a successful formula throughout the past 21 editions. This year the program consisted of a research track, an industry track and three invited keynote talks; two in the research track and one in the industry track. Prof. Wolfram Burgard (University of Freiburg) gave the first invited talk in the research track on 2 ̆ 2 Reliable Life-long Navigation for Mobile Robots. 2 ̆ 2, and prof. Peter Flach (University of Bristol) the second one on 2 ̆ 2 Machine Learning: Unity in Diversity. 2 ̆ 2 The invited talk in the industry track was given by Peter van der Putten on 2 ̆ 2 AI in the Wild: Decisioning, Predictive Analytics and Simulation for Customer Experience Optimization. 2 ̆ 2 Authors could submit in three paper categories: A-type papers presenting new original work, B-type papers summarizing the main results of papers accepted after June 1 st, 2008 for AI-related refereed conferences or journals, and C-type papers proposing for demonstrations. In total we received 117 submissions, of which 105 in the research track (45 of type A, 54 of type B and 6 Demos) and 12 in the industry track (6 of type A, 4 of type B and 2 Demos).
