The intention of this combined device is to decrease maintenance and increase availability and reliability.

40|$|A {{high-voltage}} {{circuit breaker}} is an indispensable {{piece of equipment}} in the electric transmission and distribution systems. Transonic flow typically occurs inside <b>breaking</b> <b>chamber</b> during the current interruption, which determines the insulating characteristics of gas. Therefore, accurate compressible flow simulations are required to improve the prediction of the breakdown voltages in various test duties of high-voltage circuit breakers. In this work, investigation {{of the impact of}} the solvers on the prediction capability of the breakdown voltages in capacitive switching is presented. For this purpose, a number of compressible nozzle flow validation cases have been presented. The investigation is then further extended for a real high-voltage circuit breaker geometry. The correlation between the flow prediction accuracy and the breakdown voltage prediction capability is identified...|$|E
40|$|Simulations {{for both}} {{multiphase}} flows and supersonic single phased flows are well known, however the combination {{is a less}} investigated area of research, as the two basic approaches of CFD, the pressure and the density based approach, each describe one of the phases {{in a better way}} than the other one. In this paper, we systematically investigate the solver quality of the open source CFD code OpenFOAM in handling transonic flow phenomena that typically occur inside the <b>breaking</b> <b>chamber</b> of high voltage circuit breakers, during contact separation. The solver quality is then compared with that of chosen commercial CFD tools. The main advantage of OpenFOAM is that, contrary to most of the commercial simulation tools, it is license fee free and allows access to the source code. This means that complicated multi physics phenomena inside the arcing chamber can be directly modeled into the code by users, which opens an opportunity to remove limitations of commercial CFD tools. Particularly, the shock capturing capability of OpenFOAM will be evaluated for the transonic internal flow which typically occurs in high voltage circuit breakers. Overall, Open-FOAM shows acceptable shock capturing capabilities in the performed verification and validation studies, with the solver quality comparable to some of the tested commercial CFD tools. There is still room for further solver quality improvements in OpenFOAM by implementing better shock capturing schemes such as a density-based flux-difference-splitting scheme or by writing better physical modeling of the shock/boundary layer interaction into the open architecture of OpenFOAM...|$|E

40|$|Circuit {{breakers}} for UHV (Ultra High Voltage, {{rated voltage}} ?? 800 kV) are required especially for various large-scale transmission projects, China (1100 kV) {{being the most}} recent focal point but India to follow soon with 1200 kV. The testing of these apparatus is a challenge in itself. Having experience {{with a large number}} of EHV breakers, among which 550 kV types including single break, KEMA now has developed test installations for high-power testing EHV and UHV switchgear. Given the fact that these breakers consist normally of at leat two <b>breaking</b> <b>chambers,</b> a part of the test that have to verify the (fault) current interruption capability, can be performed using only half (or a quarter) of the breaker. For livetank breakers equipped with grading capacitors this is generally true. However, {{in order to meet the}} requirements for metal enclosed switchgear (as laid down in IEC 61633) of having the correct dielectric stresses between live parts and enclosure also during the interruption process, tests other than on the complete circuit breaker are technically incorrect. This resulted in the design, realization and testing of new circuits for UHV. Key feature is the use of a double stage synthetic circuit, one stage of which is placed in the vicinity of the testobject. This has the advantage that the test-object's enclosure can remain on ground potential. Various full-scale tests have now proved this principle to be effective for 800 kV and 1100 / 1200 kV on a full-pole basis. Examples of tests are demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} the clinical effect of scleral buckling with nondrainage of subretinal fluid {{in the treatment}} of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. METHODS: A total of 111 patients(113 eyes) with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in our hospital from January 2012 to January 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. All the patients were identified as fulfilling the criteria of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Localization and scleral cryotherapy of retinal breaks with binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy in all eyes were performed during the operations. Simple scleral pressure were performed in 98 eyes. Intravitreal injection of sterile air were performed in 15 eyes. Scleral cryotherapy were performed in all cases with retinal degeneration and <b>breaks.</b> Anterior <b>chamber</b> puncture were performed before ligation suture. The final retinal reattachment rate, best corrected vision acuity, intraocular pressure and complications were observed. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 6 mo after operation. The final retinal reattachment rate at 6 mo was 97. 4 %. There were 91 eyes(80. 5 %) with improved visual acuity after operation. High intraocular pressure can be controlled after operation.

5000|$|One {{possibility}} that was feared {{at this point}} was that of <b>breaking</b> into the <b>chamber</b> too quickly, resulting in {{the water in the}} mine rushing upward and drowning the miners. An additional and possibly fatal danger was that of the miners being afflicted with decompression sickness, due to their breathing air which was at a higher pressure than the surface pressure, due to the pressure of the surrounding water.

A so-called cabinet noir was established by King Henry IV of France in 1590 as part of the Poste aux Lettres. Its mission was to open, read and reseal letters, and great expertise was developed in the restoration of broken seals. In the knowledge that mail was being opened, correspondents began to develop systems to encrypt and decrypt their letters.

30|$|The role {{of surface}} {{diffusivity}} of Ag adatoms {{in the formation}} of islands and then grains was demonstrated by Jing et al. in STM measurements, where with increasing layer thickness the silver clusters were more and more pronounced [14]. The same authors observed that deposition of 12 monolayers of silver at 190  K results in an increase of island densities by 4 orders of magnitude in comparison to that obtained at RT. At the same time, silver atom clusters were at least 1 order of magnitude smaller. The diffusivity of Ag adatoms is reduced with an amorphous 1 -nm Ge interlayer [15 – 17], 5 -nm layer of chromium [18], or 1 -nm film of Ti [19]. A 2 -nm nickel layer is nearly as efficient in metal layer smoothing as germanium, which moreover enhances the surface plasmon resonance sensitivity of the Ag layer [20]. Recently, a 1 -nm-thick copper seed layer was also reported to be effective in smoothing silver nanolayers [21]. When a continuous 6 -nm Ag layer on 1  nm of Ge is sequentially deposited on fused silica substrate without <b>breaking</b> the <b>chamber</b> vacuum, a silver surface roughness of root-mean-square (RMS)[*]=[*] 0.6  nm is achievable [22]. In Ag/MgF 2 /Ag on quartz with a Ge seed growth layer, the roughness of the silver surface considerably modifies the reflectance spectra [11]. In our recent paper [19], we proved that the smoothness of Ag/Ge, Ag/Ni, and Ag/Ti films - that is, reduction of losses on scattering - is achieved at the cost of increased specific resistance - that is, increase of ohmic losses in the skin depth-thick layer of silver.|$|R

In the procedure's current setup, the contaminant conduction hole ("lid") is initially open and a vacuum <b>chamber</b> <b>break</b> must occur between the bakeout and certification phases to close the box from the vacuum chamber. This exposure is necessary to allow the outgassed contaminants to escape the box's volume rapidly during bakeout phase, but payload certification isn't usually performed while the lid is still open, because it exposes the payload, TQCM, and box volume to chamber contaminants.

The antennas must survive all ground operations plus the nominal 670 -Martian-day mission that includes summer and winter seasons of the Mars environment. Successful development of processes established coaxial cable hardware fatigue limits, which were well beyond the expected in-flight exposures. In keeping with traditional qualification philosophy, this was accomplished by subjecting flight-representative coaxial cables to temperature cycling of the same depth as expected in-flight, but for three times the expected number of in-flight thermal cycles. Insertion loss and return loss tests were performed on the coaxial cables during the thermal <b>chamber</b> <b>breaks.</b> A vector network analyzer was calibrated and operated over the operational frequency range 7. 145 to 8. 450 GHz.
