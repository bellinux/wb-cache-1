5|$|Hordern's London debut came in January 1937, as an {{understudy}} to Bernard Lee in {{the play}} Night Sky at the Savoy Theatre. On nights {{when he was not}} required, Hordern would <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> undertake the duties of assistant stage manager, for which he was paid £2.10s a week. In March, Daltry, who had since formed his own company, Westminster Productions, cast Hordern as Ludovico in Othello.|$|E
5|$|The 87th Division {{returned}} to the United States in July 1945 expecting to <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> {{play a role in}} the defeat of the Japanese, but the sudden termination of the war in the Pacific while the division was reassembling at Fort Benning changed the future of the 87th. The Division was inactivated on 21 September 1945. The 87th Reconnaissance Troop was deactivated on the same day.|$|E
5|$|The Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy (MCPON) is {{the senior}} enlisted person in the Navy, {{appointed}} by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) {{to serve as a}} spokesperson to address the issues of enlisted personnel to the highest positions in the Navy. The MCPON {{is the senior}} enlisted advisor to the Chief of Naval Operations and Chief of Naval Personnel. Exact duties vary, depending on the CNO, though the duties generally include traveling throughout the Navy, observing training and talking to sailors and their families. The MCPON serves on several boards concerned with enlisted members, represents the Department of the Navy at special events, and may <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> testify before Congress regarding enlisted personnel issues.|$|E

5|$|The {{committee}} {{found that}} the CMF was a hollow shell of its former self, depleted in numbers and in equipment and unable to adequately fulfil its tasks. However, it still {{found that the}}re was a role for the CMF to play in the strategic environment that existed at the time, although it would no longer <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> provide the base upon which mobilisation {{in a time of war}} would be built, instead it would be used to augment the Regular Army. This was the first step in creating the concept of a total force, in which the differing virtues of the citizen soldier and the regular soldier would be used to complement each other, and in this vein the Millar Report recommended that the name be changed from the CMF to the Australian Army Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Rogers {{outlined}} {{the request for}} the establishment of the commission, with four members to be appointed by each house of Congress and three by President Calvin Coolidge. Rodgers and Dallinger wanted $10,000 for the commission, and for Congress to authorize the issuance of commemorative coins and stamps. Rogers told the committee that the language for the legislative provisions for the coin had been borrowed from the bill for the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar (1920–1921), and reminded them of other commemorative coins that had been issued. At the time, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. A maximum of 300,000 coins was requested. Dallinger noted that the government would incur no cost from the commemorative half dollars: it would profit from the seignorage and would never <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> redeem them, as they would be retained by collectors. After the two congressmen appeared, Chairman Luce introduced a letter from the Senate Majority Leader, Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, indicating his support for the bill. Luce reported his own version of the resolution the following day, with his committee's recommendation that it pass.|$|E
5|$|The USPTO will {{contact the}} senior {{registrant}} to inform that {{party of the}} claim against their mark. The proceeding in which the respective rights of the parties are determined is like a trial in which the applicant must submit evidence showing that the applicant had adopted the mark in good faith, that the applicant had adopted the mark prior to the senior registrant's date of registration, and that the confusion is not likely. The senior registrant may present evidence to the contrary, {{in order to prevent}} the loss of control over the use of the registered mark in the applicant's claimed territory. Both parties may take discovery in the form of requests for admission, interrogatories, requests for production, and depositions. As with a regular trial, the TTAB may <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> resolve disputes over whether discovery requests are overbroad, and whether discovery responses are inadequate.|$|E

5|$|To assist {{command and}} control of the new {{divisions}}, two field armies were formed— the Northern Army and the Southern Army. The Northern Army had five divisions and three brigades and was responsible for the North West Frontier to Bengal while the Southern Army, which had four divisions in India and two formations outside the subcontinent, was responsible for Baluchistan to southern India. The regiments and battalions of the new organisation would be numbered in a single sequence and the old titles of the Bombay, Madras and the Bengal Armies would be discontinued. The new regiments and battalions, instead of remaining at their home base, could now all <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> serve anywhere in the country, and a tour of duty on the North West Frontier would be an established posting. One change that was not accepted was the formation of all-British or all-Indian brigades and the system of having one British regiment or battalion in each brigade remained.|$|E
5|$|With Japan's {{entry into}} the war {{following}} the attacks on Pearl Harbor and Malaya, it became {{more likely that the}} division would <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> undertake active service overseas, and the division was mobilised for war. In early January 1942, Major General Stanley Savige, an experienced officer who had commanded the 17th Brigade in combat against the Germans in the Middle East earlier in the war, took over command of the division. Savige set about the task of preparing the division for combat and he began by removing officers that he did not think were physically fit enough or competent to lead in battle and replacing them with men who had gained experience in AIF units. A comprehensive training program was established and in April 1942 the division was assigned to the Australian I Corps, and in order to enable divisional exercises to begin, the 3rd Division moved to Bonegilla, Victoria. In order to toughen the men up, Savige decided that they would march on foot to the new camp.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of agnatic kinship and the feudal system, which formalised mutual obligations {{of service and}} protection, organised through heritable jurisdictions, {{has been seen as}} creating the Highland clan system. The head of a clan was usually the eldest son of the last chief of the most powerful sept or branch. The leading families of a clan formed the fine, often seen as equivalent to Lowland lairds, providing council in peace and leadership in war, and below them were the daoine usisle (in Gaelic) or tacksmen (in Scots), who managed the clan lands and collected the rents. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan heads and could <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> act as soldiers when needed. In the early modern era they usually took the clan name as their surname, turning it into a massive, if often fictive, kin group. Economic change and the imposition of royal justice had begun to undermine the clan system before the eighteenth century, but the process was accelerated after the Jacobite rising of 1745. Highland dress was banned, clansmen were forcible disarmed, there was the compulsory purchase of heritable jurisdictions, many chiefs were exiled and ordinary clansmen were sent to the colonies as indentured labourers. Within a generation, these factors reduced most clan leaders to the status of simple landholders, without independent military power.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of the 163d, this was already the case in the F-4 and even in the F-100 days. In the early days of F-16 {{operations}} the emphasis was more on air defense than on the attack role. With the absence of modern targeting pods the deployment of air-to-ground weapons was somewhat hampered since other units had to <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> perform the target designation.|$|E

25|$|Alternative (“alternate”) tuning {{refers to}} any open-string note {{arrangement}} other than standard tuning.
