5|$|Deep-fried <b>butter</b> <b>is</b> a snack food {{comprising}} butter that is {{coated with}} a batter or breading and then deep-fried. The dish has been served at several fairs in the United States; among them, the State Fair of Texas in Dallas, Texas, and the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, Iowa; {{and now it is}} served worldwide.

40|$|There {{is a clear}} {{consumer}} need for new textures and for natural and food inspired ingredients in cosmetics. Natural <b>butters</b> <b>are</b> fully in line with these trends. As a result, more and more products containing <b>butters</b> <b>are</b> launched on the European cosmetic market. They are found mainly in skincare and colour cosmetic products. <b>Butters</b> <b>are</b> used as emollients, texturing agents or to perfume finished products.

25|$|The {{two main}} types of peanut <b>butter</b> <b>are</b> crunchy (or chunky) and smooth. In crunchy peanut butter, some coarsely-ground peanut {{fragments}} are included to give extra texture.

5|$|The {{marginal}} rate {{of transformation}} {{can be expressed}} in terms of either commodity. The marginal opportunity costs of guns in terms of <b>butter</b> <b>is</b> simply the reciprocal of the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms of guns. If, for example, the (absolute) slope at point BB in the diagram is equal to 2, to produce one more packet of butter, the production of 2 guns must be sacrificed. If at AA, the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms of guns is equal to 0.25, the sacrifice of one gun could produce four packets of butter, and the opportunity cost of guns in terms of <b>butter</b> <b>is</b> 4.|$|E

5000|$|John Hoffman was {{the owner}} of the bakery where the mistake was made. The real story is there were two types of butter [...] "smears" [...] used in his bakery: a gooey butter and a deep butter. The deep <b>butter</b> <b>was</b> used for deep butter coffee cakes. The gooey <b>butter</b> <b>was</b> used as an {{adhesive}} for things like Danish rolls and stollens. The gooey <b>butter</b> <b>was</b> smeared across the surface, then the item was placed in coconut, hazelnuts, peanuts, crumbs or whatever was desired so they would stick to the product.|$|R

5|$|For example, if {{one assumes}} that the economy's {{available}} quantities of factors of production do not change over time and that technological progress does not occur, if the economy is operating on the PPF, production of guns {{would need to be}} sacrificed to produce more butter. If production is efficient, the economy can choose between combinations (points) on the PPF: B if guns are of interest, C if more <b>butter</b> <b>is</b> needed, D if an equal mix of butter and guns is required.|$|E
5|$|Fried <b>butter</b> <b>is</b> {{a similar}} dish, for which recipes exist {{dating to the}} 17th century. The first known recipe for fried butter dates to 1615. Fried butter was {{documented}} in the cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy in 1747. The recipe entailed soaking butter in salted water for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and roasting it under a low fire while continuously covering it with egg yolks and additional bread crumbs. Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E

Whole milk, butter and cream have high levels of saturated fat. <b>Butter</b> <b>is</b> a good source of Vitamin A.|$|E

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the year 1903 an educational <b>butter</b> contest <b>was</b> instituted by the Dairy Department, at Ames, Iowa. The co-operation of the State Dairy Commissioner, H. R. Wright, was secured throughout the test. Each exhibitor sent a thirty pound tub of butter to Ames every other month, thus making six exhibits during the year. The <b>butter</b> <b>was</b> scored at Ames by Prof. G. L. McKay, and P. H. Kiefier, Assistant State Commissioner, acted as expert. As soon as the <b>butter</b> <b>was</b> scored a sample for chemical analysis was taken from each tub. The <b>butter</b> <b>was</b> then sent to New York to be re-scored by Mr. W. H. Healy. The average of the two scores at Ames and New York constituted the real basis upon which the final decision was rendered...|$|R

25|$|Commercial <b>butter</b> <b>is</b> about 80% {{butterfat}} and 15% water; traditionally made butter {{may have}} {{as little as}} 65% fat and 30% water. Butterfat {{is a mixture of}} triglyceride, a triester derived from glycerol and three of any of several fatty acid groups. Butter becomes rancid when these chains break down into smaller components, like butyric acid and diacetyl. The density of <b>butter</b> <b>is</b> 0.911g/cm3 (0.527oz/in3), about the same as ice.|$|E
25|$|Clarified <b>butter</b> <b>is</b> {{butter with}} {{almost all of}} its water and milk solids removed, leaving almost-pure butterfat. Clarified <b>butter</b> <b>is</b> made by heating butter to its melting point and then {{allowing}} it to cool; after settling, the remaining components separate by density. At the top, whey proteins form a skin, which is removed. The resulting butterfat is then poured off from the mixture of water and casein proteins that settle to the bottom.|$|E
25|$|<b>Butter</b> <b>is</b> a water-in-oil {{emulsion}} resulting from an inversion of the cream; in a {{water-in-oil emulsion}}, the milk proteins are the emulsifiers. Butter remains a solid when refrigerated, but softens to a spreadable consistency at room temperature, and melts to a thin liquid consistency at 32–35°C (90–95°F). The density of <b>butter</b> <b>is</b> 911g/L (0.950 lb per US pint). It generally has a pale yellow color, but varies from deep yellow to nearly white. Its unmodified color {{is dependent on}} the animals' feed and genetics but is commonly manipulated with food colorings in the commercial manufacturing process, most commonly annatto or carotene.|$|E
