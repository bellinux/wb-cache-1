50|$|Aluminium {{smelting}} via the Hall-Héroult process produces {{carbon dioxide}} as a by-product. The <b>basic</b> <b>reaction</b> is Al2O3 → 2Al + 3O; {{if all the}} oxygen at the red-hot carbon anode becomes carbon monoxide (that subsequently becomes carbon dioxide) then for one tonne of aluminium, 1.55 tonnes of CO would result, becoming 2.4 tonnes of CO2. However, if all the oxygen went directly to CO2, then 1.56 tonnes of CO2 would result. At the stated rate of 1.97 tonnes of carbon dioxide per tonne of aluminium, the production of 272,000 tonnes of aluminium in a year would emit 535,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. In 2007, Tom Campbell, {{the chief executive of}} majority owner Rio Tinto Aluminium NZ, said that the smelter was among the top 5% of the world's 250 aluminium smelters in terms of low emissions. Metal produced by Tiwai Point is marketed under the RenewAl brand, which guarantees that less than four tonnes of CO2 is emitted for every tonne of aluminium produced.|$|E
50|$|A ketone {{group is}} polar, as oxygen is more {{electronegative}} than carbon. Therefore, the carbonyl atom of the ketone group is electron deficient, thus electrophilic, and can easily react with nucleophiles. However, {{it does not}} undergo substitution reactions, as the attached molecule is a too strong base to be eliminated. As a result of this, irreversible nucleophilic addition reactions are possible: a nucleophile can add to the carbonyl carbon, but {{due to the lack}} of a good leaving group, no base is eliminated. This intermediate molecule takes up a proton, so a hydroxyl group is formed. When there is sufficient acid present, the hydroxyl group can be protonated further, making it a good leaving group. This functional group will then react as an alcohol group. As described above is the <b>basic</b> <b>reaction</b> mechanism of ketones. In this way ketones can undergo several organic reactions, reacting with compounds like grignard reagents, acetylide, cyanide, and hydride ions, amines, water, alcohols and peroxyacids.|$|E
