40|$|Demand side {{management}} (DSM) {{is a key}} {{solution for}} reducing the peak-time power consumption in smart grids. To provide incentives for consumers to shift their consumption to off-peak times, the utility company charges consumers differential pricing for using power {{at different times of}} the day. Consumers take into account these differential prices when deciding when and how much power to consume daily. Importantly, while consumers enjoy lower <b>billing</b> <b>costs</b> when shifting their power usage to off-peak times, they also incur discomfort costs due to the altering of their power consumption patterns. Existing works propose stationary strategies for the myopic consumers to minimize their short-term billing and discomfort costs. In contrast, we model the interaction emerging among self-interested, foresighted consumers as a repeated energy scheduling game and prove that the stationary strategies are suboptimal in terms of long-term total billing and discomfort costs. Subsequently, we propose a novel framework for determining optimal nonstationary DSM strategies, in which consumers can choose different daily power consumption patterns depending on their preferences, routines, and needs. As a direct consequence of the nonstationary DSM policy, different subsets of consumers are allowed to use power in peak times at a low price. The subset of consumers that are selected daily to have their joint discomfort and <b>billing</b> <b>costs</b> minimized is determined based on the consumers' power consumption preferences {{as well as on the}} past history of which consumers have shifted their usage previously. Importantly, we show that the proposed strategies are incentive-compatible. Simulations confirm that, given the same peak-to-average ratio, the proposed strategy can reduce the total cost (billing and discomfort costs) by up to 50 % compared to existing DSM strategies...|$|E

30|$|The second {{category}} assumed {{that consumers are}} myopic and price-anticipating, meaning that they take into account how their consumption will affect the prices. In this case, each consumer’s electricity usage affects the other consumers’ <b>billing</b> <b>costs.</b> These works [3, 17, 18] model the interaction emerging among myopic consumers as one-shot games and studied the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the emerging game. In this paper, we also model the consumers as price-anticipating. However, consumers {{interact with each other}} repeatedly and are foresighted, thereby engaging in a repeated game. It is well-known that the Nash equilibrium in one-shot games with myopic players is often inefficient. In this paper, we design a novel class of incentive protocols based on review strategies in order to achieve the socially optimal load scheduling in smart grid systems. Prior work [19] also studied DSM in a repeated game setting. However, that work assumes that each individual consumer’s action can be perfectly observed, while in this work, only the aggregate scheduling of a set of participating consumers can be observed with noise.|$|E
40|$|A {{substantial}} portion of resource costs incurred by data centers relate to en-ergy costs, with cooling energy and equipment powering energy accounting for a major fraction. Other major costs incurred by data centers, is due to huge data transmission volume and resultant network bandwidth consumption. In this disser-tation, we study problems inspired by the needs to reduce energy consumption and network bandwidth <b>billing</b> <b>costs</b> in data centers. A significant amount of data center cooling energy is wasted due to thermal imbalance and hot spots. In order to prevent hot spots, it is desirable to schedule the workload in a data center in a thermally aware manner, assigning jobs to machines not just based on local load of the machines, but based on the overall thermal pro-file of the data center. This is challenging because of the spatial cross-interference between machines, where a job assigned to a machine may impact not only that ma-chine’s temperature, but also nearby machines due to directional cooling mechanisms currently used in most data centers and subsequent hot air recirculation effects. We define the notion of effective load of a machine, that captures this effect and analyz...|$|E

The financing of financial institutions by means of orders requires the manufacturing companies to provide transaction data, but because of the competitive relationship between manufacturing companies, there is a need for transaction privacy protection. On the one hand, the transaction price between competitors needs to be kept secret; on the other hand, the trading behavior of special industries requires privacy protection, such as military units.|$|E
40|$|Background: Hypofractionated {{prostate}} radiation reduces treatment duration with outcomes {{comparable to}} conventional radiation, but little data exist {{that supports the}} persistent value of hypofractionated radiation after taking into account costs associated with management of late radiation toxicity. We report a cost minimization comparison of conventional intensity modulated radiation (CIMRT) to dose-escalated hypofractionated intensity modulated radiation (HIMRT), taking into account management of late radiation toxicity, to determine if long-term cost efficiency persists. ^ Patients and Methods: A decision tree was used to model probabilities of maximum late bowel and urinary toxicities from a randomized trial. Men with organ-confined prostate cancer were treated with 75. 6 Gy in 1. 8 Gy fractions or 72 Gy in 2. 4 Gy fractions. Costs were estimated from an institutional healthcare perspective, using 2014 national payment rates for healthcare services utilized from trial report and chart review. Estimates were verified with patient level <b>billing</b> <b>costs,</b> adjusted to 2014 US dollars. Sensitivity analysis assessed model uncertainty. ^ Results: The expected cost for HIMRT and late toxicity management was 22, 957, with a cost savings benefit of approximately 7, 000 compared to CIMRT (30, 241). CIMRT was the common factor among the 5 most influential parameters contributing to total costs of radiotherapy and toxicity management. Late toxicity comprises a small part (3 ̆c 10...|$|E

Finland is one of the European countries who are far ahead in the field of electronic invoices and more and more Finnish companies are moving over to it. However, often it is the larger companies that have the expertise and resources to implement such invoicing systems while smaller companies are more cautious with the adoption of new systems or standards. So how much does it take for a small company to develop and implement their own Finvoice B 2 C billing solution? Most well known billing software providers in Finland are already providing Finvoice invoice support with their software. Some banks are even offering online portals for companies to send electronic bills. However, all these products and services come with a price. This thesis will look further into the Finvoice billing standard and the effort needed to develop a Finvoice invoicing solution for a small company. This will be carried out with the goal of gaining knowledge in the field of electronic invoicing and investigating the requirements to develop a cost efficient billing solution for a small size company. A prototype of a Finvoice billing solution has been developed and handed over to Unihost, a Finnish webhosting company, which allows the company to browse, filter, search, view, and generate Finvoice invoices from their bills while cutting costs, {{and with the help of}} some added modules to the system, they will have close to a fully automated e-billing solution.

40|$|BackgroundCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt {{infection}} {{is a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality in the treatment of hydrocephalus and is associated with significant medical cost. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of antibiotic-impregnated (AI) shunt catheters in reducing CSF shunt infection; however, providers remain reluctant to adopt AI catheters into practice because of the increased upfront cost. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if the use of AI catheters provided cost savings in a large nationwide database. MethodsHospital discharge and billing records from the Premier Perspective Database from 2003 – 2009 were retrospectively reviewed to identify all adult and pediatric patients undergoing de novo ventricular shunt placement. The incidence of shunt infection within 1 year of implantation was determined. Shunt infection–related cost was defined as all inpatient <b>billing</b> <b>costs</b> incurred during hospitalization for treatment of shunt infection. ResultsIn 287 U. S. hospitals, 10, 819 adult (AI catheters, 963; standard catheters, 9856) and 1770 pediatric (AI catheters, 229; standard catheters, 1541) patients underwent ventricular shunt placement. AI catheters were associated with significant reduction in infection for both adult (2. 2 % vs. 3. 6 %, P = 0. 02) and pediatric (2. 6 % vs. 7. 1 %, P < 0. 01) patients. Total infection-related costs were $ 17, 371, 320 ($ 45, 714 ± $ 49, 745 per shunt infection) for adult patients and $ 6, 508, 064 ($ 56, 104 ± $ 65, 746 per shunt infection) for pediatric patients. Infection-related cost per 100 de novo shunts placed was $ 120, 534 for AI catheters and $ 162, 659 for standard catheters in adult patients and $ 165, 087 for AI catheters and $ 395, 477 for standard catheters in pediatric patients. ConclusionsIn analysis of this large, nationwide database, AI catheters were found to be associated with a significant reduction in infection incidence, resulting in tremendous cost savings. AI catheters were associated with a cost savings of $ 42, 125 and $ 230, 390 per 100 de novo shunts placed in adult and pediatric patients, respectively...|$|E

Design A randomized retrospective chart review from 1 / 1 / 03 to 5 / 1 / 04 comparing the reimbursement rates of private insurance, government insurance, and a fee-at-time-of service plan considering overhead <b>billing</b> <b>costs.</b> Setting The study {{will take place at}} Family Tree Healthcare, a rural family practice clinic in Carlton, Oregon, where many patients, mostly uninsured, use the fee-at-time-of-service plan. Patients and other Participants Those patients seen from 1 / 1 / 03 to 5 / 1 / 04, randomly selected, having either an ICD- 9 code of 845. 0, 465. 9, 461. 0, 724. 5 or diagnoses in the chart of sprain/strain, upper respiratory infection/pharyngitis, back pain, or sinusitis. Main outcome Measures Reimbursement rates of fee-at-time-of-service visits compared to private and government insurance reimbursements. Results Although reimbursement rates were higher per service from the private insurance, FATOS patients out-paid public insurance by an average of $ 4. 72 for a 99213 code. The average payment for a 456. 9 /URI code was $ 58. 31 for private insurance, $ 33. 28 for public insurance, and $ 38. 00 for FATOS patients. For a code of 845. 0 /sprain-strain average payment was $ 60. 83 for private insurance, $ 33. 28 for public insurance, and $ 38. 00 for FATOS patients. Payment for 461. 0 /sinusitis code averaged $ 57. 45 from private insurance, $ 33. 28 from public insurance, and $ 38. 00 from FATOS patients. Payment for 724. 5 /back pain was $ 63. 53 from private insurance, $ 33. 28 from public insurance, and $ 38. 00 from FATOS patients.
