These individual governments rejected the potent combination of enticing promises and subtle (or outright) threats Bismarck {{used to try to}} gain their support against the Habsburgs. The Prussian war cabinet understood that its only supporters among the German states against the Habsburgs were two small principalities <b>bordering</b> <b>on</b> Brandenburg that had little military strength or political clout: the Grand Duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

A series of cross-border raids and skirmishes began on the frontier between Libya and Egypt. On 13 September 1940, an Italian force advanced across the frontier into Egypt, reaching Sidi Barrani on 16 September, where the advance was halted until logistical difficulties could be overcome.|$|E

5|$|The smooth toadfish {{is found}} along Australia's eastern and {{southeast}} coast, from Moreton Bay in southeastern Queensland to Port Lincoln in South Australia {{as well as}} Kangaroo Island and Tasmania. It {{is one of the}} most abundant fishes in the muddy areas of Port Philip Bay. It generally lives in shallow water less than 3m (10ft) deep, often over mudflats in estuaries. In areas of seagrass beds, smooth toadfish are more commonly found in sand areas <b>bordering</b> <b>on</b> the seagrass patches. They are more commonly found in seagrass patches in water less than 1.5m (5ft) deep rather than deeper water of 3.5–6m (11–20ft). A South Australian field study on wrack and associated fauna found that the smooth toadfish was associated with larger volumes and aggregations containing green algae.|$|E

He develops a talent for intrigue, which irritates Sir Magnus to the extent that Widmerpool is asked to leave the organisation. He joins a City firm of bill-brokers and still under the age of 30, becomes an influential and respected figure in the financial world. By the late 1930s, Widmerpool is advising Donners-Brebner again. Just before the outbreak of war in September 1939, he oversees a scheme on behalf of Donners to corner the Turkish market in chromite and emerges unscathed when the project collapses.|$|E
5|$|For decades, {{research}} on the Polish Underground State was restricted, largely because the communist People's Republic of Poland {{did not wish to}} fully acknowledge the role of the non-communist resistance. During the first postwar Stalinist years, efforts to explore this topic were regarded as dangerous, <b>bordering</b> <b>on</b> illegal. Research into the events occurring in the Soviet-annexed territories in the 1939–1941 period was particularly difficult. The limited research devoted to the Underground State that did take place was done mainly by Polish émigré historians living in the West. The communist state downplayed the importance of the non-communist resistance movements, while the communist movement (Armia Ludowa) was emphasized as being of primary importance; in fact, the opposite was true. The absence of research by Polish scholars, along with obstacles presented to foreign scholars seeking access to source material in communist Poland, contributed to a situation in which there was virtually no discussion by Western scholars of one of Europe's largest resistance movements—the non-communist Polish resistance movement. The bulk of Western research centred on the much smaller French Resistance (la Résistance).|$|E
5|$|Ion Creangă {{was born}} in Humulești in the Principality of Moldavia, a former village which has since been {{incorporated}} into Târgu Neamț city, the son of Orthodox trader Ștefan sin Petre Ciubotariul and his wife Smaranda. His native area, <b>bordering</b> <b>on</b> heavily forested areas, was in the Eastern Carpathian foothills, and included into {{what was then the}} principality of Moldavia. The surrounding region's population preserved an archaic way of life, dominated by shepherding, textile manufacturing and related occupations, and noted for preserving the older forms of local folklore. Another characteristic of the area, which left an impression on Creangă's family history, was related to the practice of transhumance and the links between ethnic Romanian communities {{on both sides of the}} mountains, in Moldavia and Transylvania: on his maternal side, the writer descended from Maramureș-born peasants, while, according to literary historian George Călinescu, his father's origin may have been further southwest, in Transylvania-proper.|$|E

5|$|Mahendra, in his {{now defunct}} blog Moondram Pirai..., {{referred}} to the film as a suspense thriller, while N. Venkateswaran of The Times of India {{described it as a}} psychological thriller. Devika Bai, writing for the New Straits Times, referred to Moodu Pani as a whodunit film. K.Hariharan, director of the L. V. Prasad Film & TV Academy, noted that sexuality and the repression of desire were the dominant motifs in Moodu Pani, expressed through the mysterious misty atmospheres of Ooty where the protagonist confronts their psychological antagonist. He also noted that Moodu Pani, like many of Mahendra's films, borrowed its themes and stylistic devices from French New Wave and New Hollywood styles of filmmaking. Ilangovan noted that Chandru's character, which was depicted as having flashes of wickedness <b>bordering</b> <b>on</b> perversion, was new to Tamil cinema. Crime and detective fiction writer Pattukkottai Prabakar considers Moodu Pani, along with Sigappu Rojakkal and Nooravathu Naal (1984), to explore the personalities and behavioural traits of psychopaths in detail.|$|E
5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles <b>bordering</b> <b>on</b> cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E
5|$|The prize, a 24-gun {{corvette}} named Utile, {{was taken}} into service with the Royal Navy as HMS Utile and Lydiard was promoted and given command of her, a commission confirmed on 22 July 1796. Macnamara's later service with Nelson included the capture of Portoferraio, the evacuations of Caprera and Corsica, and expeditions against Piombino and Castiglione. Macnamara had already developed a reputation for intrepidity <b>bordering</b> <b>on</b> recklessness, and he displayed these qualities again in {{an attack on the}} 18-gun Spanish brig Corso in a strong gale under enemy shore batteries. The first attempt to capture her failed, with only one man, the coxswain, getting on board. Macnamara tried again, managing to place 30 men aboard the Spanish ship, at which she surrendered. Having done so the weather prevented any further attempt to make contact with the prize. One of Macnamara's last acts in support of the Mediterranean Fleet was {{to take part in the}} Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797, in which Southampton formed part of the centre of the line as a repeating frigate.|$|E

5|$|The Navajo were an Athabaskan {{people who}} {{migrated}} {{from the north}} into the Colorado River basin around 1025 A.D. They soon established themselves as the dominant Native American tribe in the Colorado River basin, and their territory stretched over parts of present-day Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado – in the original homelands of the Puebloans. In fact, the Navajo acquired agricultural skills from the Puebloans before {{the collapse of the}} Pueblo civilization in the 14thcentury. A profusion of other tribes have made a continued, lasting presence along the Colorado River. The Mohave have lived along the rich bottomlands of the lower Colorado below Black Canyon since 1200 A.D. They were fishermen – navigating the river on rafts made of reeds to catch Gila trout and Colorado pikeminnow – and farmers, relying on the annual floods of the river rather than irrigation to water their crops. Ute peoples have inhabited the northern Colorado River basin, mainly in present-day Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, for at least 2,000 years, but did not become well established in the Four Corners area until 1500 A.D. The Apache, Cocopah, Halchidhoma, Havasupai, Hualapai, Maricopa, Pima, and Quechan are among many other groups that live along or had territories <b>bordering</b> <b>on</b> the Colorado River and its tributaries.|$|E
5|$|The parish of Selborne lies in {{the extreme}} eastern corner of the county of Hampshire, <b>bordering</b> <b>on</b> the county of Sussex, and {{not far from the}} county of Surrey; is about fifty miles {{south-west}} of London, in latitude fifty-one, and near mid-way between the towns of Alton and Petersfield. Being very large and extensive, it abuts on twelve parishes, two of which are in Sussex—viz, Trotton and Rogate.... The soils of this district are almost as various and diversified as the views and aspects. The high part of the south-west consists of a vast hill of chalk, rising three hundred feet above the village, and is divided into a sheep-down, the high wood and a long hanging wood, called The Hanger. The covert of this eminence is altogether beech, the most lovely of all forest trees, whether we consider its smooth rind or bark, its glossy foliage, or graceful pendulous boughs. The down, or sheepwalk, is a pleasing park-like spot, of about one mile by half that space, jutting out on the verge of the hill-country, where it begins to break down into the plains, and commanding a very engaging view, being an assemblage of hill, dale, wood-lands, heath, and water. The prospect is bounded to the south-east and east by the vast range of mountains called the Sussex Downs, by Guild-down near Guildford, and by the Downs round Dorking, and Ryegate in Surrey, to the north-east, which altogether, with the country beyond Alton and Farnham, form a noble and extensive outline.|$|E
5|$|Thơ's {{approach}} to removing Diệm supporters from positions of influence drew criticism from both supporters {{and opponents of}} the deposed president. Some felt he was not vigorous enough in removing pro-Diệm elements from authority, whereas others felt that {{the magnitude of the}} turnover of public servants was excessive and <b>bordering</b> <b>on</b> vengeance. A number of officials suspected of having engaged in corruption or Diệmist oppression were indiscriminately arrested without charge, most of whom were later released. Đính and the new national police chief, General Mai Hữu Xuân, were given control of the interior ministry. The pair were accused of arresting people en masse, before releasing them in return for bribes and pledges of loyalty. Not all officials under Diệm could automatically be considered pro-Diệm, yet there were calls for further removals of the old guard. The government was criticised for firing large numbers of district and provincial chiefs directly appointed by Diệm, causing a breakdown in law and order during the abrupt transition of power. One high profile and heavily criticised non-removal was that of General Đỗ Cao Trí, the commander of the ARVN I Corps who gained prominence for his particularly stringent anti-Buddhist crackdown in the central region around Huế. Trí was simply transferred to the II Corps in the Central Highlands directly south of the I Corps region.|$|E
