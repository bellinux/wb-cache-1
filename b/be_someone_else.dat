This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said {{he wished he had}} made the call on the evening of the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down.|$|E

25|$|Roger Ramey {{sent the}} demo tape out to every major label in Nashville, and {{was met with}} a solid wall of {{rejection}} by them all. After a month of not getting anywhere, out of desperation to help his sister, {{he decided to take}} a chance with MCA Nashville. MCA, being the industry leader at the time was his first choice of labels. Taking a cassette of the five song demo of Loveless, Roger bluffed his way past the receptionist of Tony Brown, the head of A (Artist & Repertoire – in charge of finding and developing new talent) by pretending to <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> who was late for an appointment.|$|E

500|$|Barker {{received}} an OBE in 1978. He {{was an avid}} collector of antiques, books and posters and amassed a collection of over 53,000 postcards. He produced several compilation books of them, including Ronnie Barker's Book of Bathing Beauties, A Pennyworth of Art, and Sauce. Barker rarely appeared in public, and when he did, it was almost always in character. He once said, [...] "I've always known I haven't a personality of my own, I have to <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> to be happy. That's why I became an actor, I suppose." ...|$|E
500|$|The men of {{the village}} join in a rousing {{drinking}} song ("To beer!"), while Jeník and Kecal argue the merits, respectively, of love and money over beer. The women enter, and the whole group joins in dancing a furiant. Away from the jollity the nervous Vašek muses over his forthcoming marriage in a stuttering song ("My-my-my mother said to me"). Mařenka appears, and guesses immediately who he is, but does not reveal her own identity. Pretending to <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else,</b> she paints a picture of [...] "Mařenka" [...] as a treacherous deceiver. Vašek is easily fooled, and when Mařenka, in her false guise, pretends to woo him ("I know of a maiden fair"), he falls for her charms and swears to give Mařenka up.|$|E

2500|$|Another Colbert {{neologism}} {{related to}} Wikipedia is [...] "Wikilobbying", regarding which he stated [...] "when money determines Wikipedia entries, reality {{has become a}} commodity". He alluded to a case involving controversy over whether governments should reject a Microsoft document format {{in favor of an}} independent standard, during which Microsoft allegedly hired a Linux user to edit Wikipedia to ensure neutral and factual coverage of Microsoft's version. Colbert used the term [...] "self-determination" [...] to refer to corporations being able to act out their fantasies online by editing their own Wikipedia entries. Colbert described Wikipedia as [...] "Second Life for corporations", saying that if a corporation wants to pretend to <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> online, then that is their business.|$|E

40|$|International audienceReasoning {{research}} suggests that people use more stringent criteria when they evaluate other’s arguments than when they produce arguments themselves. To demonstrate this ‘selective laziness,’ we used a choice blindness manipulation. In two experiments, participants had to produce a series of arguments in answer to reasoning problems, and they {{were then asked to}} evaluate other people’s arguments about the same problems. Unknown to the participants, in one of the trials, they were presented with their own argument as if it <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else’s.</b> Among those participants who accepted the manipulation and thus thought they <b>were</b> evaluating <b>someone</b> <b>else’s</b> argument, more than half (56 % and 58 %) rejected the arguments that were in fact their own. Moreover, participants were more likely to reject their own arguments for invalid than for valid answers. This demonstrates that people are more critical of other people’s arguments than of their own, without being overly critical: they are better able to tell valid from invalid arguments when the arguments <b>are</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else’s</b> than their own...|$|R
