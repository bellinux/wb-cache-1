She felt that shutting her relationship with Tommy was also a cleansing of who she was. She felt that part of what she was dropping was the shmaltzy pop singer ballad kind of stuff he was adamant about. I had to make my exit and say 'Mariah, you need to redefine yourself, that's fine.

500|$|Filming {{of the two}} episodes {{occurred}} from September 25, 2015, until October 15, 2015. The Flashs {{episode was}} directed by Ralph Hemecker, and Arrows by Thor Freudenthal. Berlanti discussed the logistic nightmare of bringing the three series together since {{the first couple of}} episodes of Legends of Tomorrow had already been shot before the filming of the crossover episodes. In addition, there were characters from The Flash and Arrow [...] "that we were also shooting out of those respective shows before we went into shooting Legends to then have to come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> the introduction of some of the characters here." [...] Falk Hentschel described the filming as [...] "an acting marathon" [...] constantly moving from one set to another during the day, but had a blast.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by David LaChapelle and shot on March 13 and 14, 2004, in Los Angeles. The lighting was described as [...] "saturated, but low and naturalistic" [...] to give the video a cinematic feel, referencing the 1995 film Leaving Las Vegas. It premiered on TRL on April 12, 2004. Spears called the show and explained the video explored reincarnation. She added, [...] "It's more like a movie. It's different than anything I've ever done. It's dark, and it shows me in a different light. Of course, I'm going to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> dance videos, but I wanted to be inspired and challenged."

He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not {{originally intended to}} be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story. [...] "Even though there's {{a part of me}} that would like to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> the quick Izzie farewell, [...] " [...] she says, [...] "I also think that my last scene - where Meredith says to Izzie, 'Don't go, we're your family,' and Izzie's response was, 'No you're not, you're just a bunch of people I worked with, and I can find that anywhere' - was kind of tragic and appropriate all at the same time. When I was playing the scene I was really trying to convey that, for Izzie, that was a lie that she had to tell herself to have the courage to have to move on." ...|$|E

[...] She has said that riding [...] "saved my life", explaining that, [...] "I was losing most of the function of my right side. And I decided I needed to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> what I loved before I couldn't do it anymore." [...] At first she could barely stay on a horse without getting tired, but gradually the muscle control required for riding proved directly beneficial, and psychologically, [...] "Riding exhilarated me; it gave me a joy and a purpose. When I was so fatigued that I couldn't move, the excitement of going to the barn and getting my foot in the stirrup would make me crawl out of bed." [...] As a result, she said, [...] "My desire to ride was, and is, so strong that I kept getting healthier and healthier." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's victory {{meant they}} won the trophy for the eighth time, {{extending}} their record number of victories in the competition. Midfielder Stewart Downing was awarded the Alan Hardaker Trophy as {{the man of the}} match. Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was delighted to have won the League Cup and was adamant that the club would continue to win trophies: [...] "Although we have won something today, that is not us finished, we don't want to stop here. We want to keep going. We've won it {{and we are going to}} really enjoy it. I know how much the players have enjoyed it and it gives you a wee flavour to come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> it again." [...] The victory meant that Dalglish became the seventh manager to win all three major domestic trophies in English football. Goalscorer Dirk Kuyt was equally delighted to have won the competition: [...] "We wanted this so desperately, this is why I came to Anfield. To get my first medal is great." [...] Meanwhile, captain Steven Gerrard had mixed emotions, due to his cousin Anthony Gerrard missing the deciding penalty: [...] "One of Anthony or I was going to be sad, one was going to be celebrating. It happens. I've got mixed emotions at the moment because I feel for Anthony and Cardiff." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{won in the}} [...] "Best Single Episode" [...] {{category}} at the 2010 British Soap Awards, and {{was nominated}} in the [...] "Best Live Event Coverage" [...] category of the Broadcast Digital Awards 2010. It received mixed reviews from critics. Tom Sutcliffe of The Independent rated [...] "EastEnders Live" [...] 4 out of 5, noting that there were [...] "a couple of moments where the seams showed", but that [...] "half the fun in watching was seeing if you could spot them". He praised EastEnders for not [...] "playing safe" [...] by including stunt work, and commented that Ian Beale's line: [...] "I wish we could go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> it all again. Do it right this time." [...] could potentially have been [...] "a horrible hostage to fortune", however felt that: [...] "in the end they more than got away with it." [...] Tim Teeman of The Times also rated the episode 4 out of 5, calling the revelation of Stacey as Archie's killer a [...] "genuine surprise", and commenting that [...] "EastEnders Live": [...] "sometimes creaked {{under the weight of}} its own ambitions – but who cares, gold stars for effort." [...] Teeman praised Clements and Turner, feeling that they [...] "excelled themselves despite the odd strained pause", though noted that in the aftermath of Bradley's fall, [...] "the perils of live TV became apparent", commenting that: [...] "The direction slackened at just the wrong moment, and you were left hoping someone would get to a bit of script to ward off any more bizarre shots of Jack and Max fighting to free themselves from a policeman's soft grip." ...|$|E
500|$|Speculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan {{returned}} to the show {{for a second time}} in its fifth season. Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T.R. Knight were set to depart from the show, but he later retracted his comment. During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's one-hundredth episode wrap party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as no one on the production team would disclose her character's fate to her. It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season. Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice. Although she was scheduled to appear in the final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010. Heigl explained that she wanted {{to spend more time with}} her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again. Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure. He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not originally intended to be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story.

500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Matt Fowler {{gave the}} episode an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.6/10, saying that: [...] "I'm sure we all loved Dexter's final moments with Arthur, {{down in the}} toy train bomb shelter, but now {{looking back at the}} scene, knowing the final moments of the episode, it's filled with so many more eerie easter eggs. Something was definitely up when Arthur said, [...] "It's already over." [...] We all thought so because we've heard him say those words before. We also saw Dexter take a beat after the line, confused about its meaning. We could have chalked it {{up to the fact that}} Arthur was accepting his own death, but Dexter's furrowed brow let us know that something more sinister was in play here. Of course, the real bitch here is that Dexter, having dispatched of Trinity officially, now can't go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> it with the spirit of vengeance. The scene stands quite beautifully on its own, but Dexter would certainly have not given Arthur an empathetic send off if he knew what that monster had done. We can all point fingers at certain missteps that Dexter took throughout the entire season - mistakes that led to Rita's demise - but when you take it in as a whole it's a rather satisfying and cleverly constructed story that actually made us all buy and believe, by the end, that Dexter truly wanted to be rid of his murderous spirit. His stubborn need to kill Trinity himself wound up circumventing the entire justice system, which would have wound up catching Arthur based solely on Deb's tenacity and expert detective work." [...] Also, IGN listed Arthur Mitchell as 2nd on a list of Dexter's Top 10 Kills saying that [...] "This was the murder that America was clamoring for. And it was effin' great." [...] In his review of the entire fourth season, Fowler, giving the season an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.5, said of the finale that [...] "It all just came off as a ton of creepy, guilty fun. I would bet that when we all saw the final scene of the season finale that we, simply due to the time we've spent the characters over four years, felt a ton of emotions that we might not have even known were there." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 1999, at a {{press conference}} in New York City to discuss The Phantom Menace, Lucas {{described}} the [...] "nine year commitment" [...] required to make a Star Wars trilogy.

The thing I didn't realize then, and that I do realize now very clearly, is that not only would they be in their 70s, but I would be in my 70s too." [...] In 2007, Lucas described making the films at that age as [...] "an idea that seemed amusing at the time, but doesn't seem realistic now", and suggested that 'off-the-cuff' comments he had made in earlier years had been misconstrued as absolute statements.|$|E

2500|$|Colter {{explained}} that in Luke Cage, {{the character is}} [...] "trying to basically stay off the radar", but an event in the series' second episode, described as [...] "hard to watch", [...] "get this series into forward action mode ...

How does one live their life and eventually go through the [...] until the acceptance is fine, I’m a hero?" [...] He felt this was a natural way of introducing the character, rather than the more traditional origin story of other Marvel properties, and differentiated the show {{from the rest of}} the MCU. Coker had plotted the story of the first four episodes before the show's writers room began work, but had initially done so over two or three episodes, with the event at the end of the second episode originally taking place at the end of the first. Loeb and Marvel's Karim Zreik told Coker to [...] "slow it down a little bit", which led to an approach that Coker compared to Unforgiven where [...] "you keep building little moments of what Luke can do but he hasn’t really engaged yet." ...|$|E
