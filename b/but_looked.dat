5|$|In the United States, Ohno is {{credited}} with popularizing and being {{the face of his}} sport. He said it is amazing being a role model to younger skaters. Growing up, he did not have that influence within his sport, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> up to other athletes outside his sport, such as Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, and Lance Armstrong. Training for short track has been the main focus of Ohno's life, but {{he has been able to}} work on other endeavors. He studied business at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu joined other National Liberals {{in expressing}} {{opposition}} to the trade convention Catargiu had signed with Austria-Hungary, which was advantageous to the latter's exports, and which, they claimed, was leading Romanian industry to ruin. He accepted it while in office, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> into adopting European-like patent laws, {{as a measure of}} encouraging local industries. A National Liberal government would repeal the agreement in 1886.|$|E

5|$|Grant {{graduated}} on July 1, 1843, ranked 21st in a {{class of}} 39, and was promoted to the rank brevet second lieutenant. Glad to leave the academy, he planned to resign his commission after his four-year term of duty. Despite his excellent horsemanship, he was not assigned to the cavalry, but to the 4th Infantry Regiment. He served as regimental quartermaster, managing supplies and equipment. Grant's first assignment took him to the Jefferson Barracks near St. Louis, Missouri. Commanded by Colonel Stephen W. Kearny, the barracks was the nation's largest military base in the west. Grant was happy with his new commander, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> forward {{to the end of his}} military service and a possible teaching career.|$|E
5|$|In 1679 another uncle died {{unexpectedly}} without sons, and Ernest Augustus became reigning Duke of Calenberg-Göttingen, {{with his}} capital at Hanover. George's surviving uncle, George William of Celle, had married his mistress {{in order to}} legitimise his only daughter, Sophia Dorothea, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> unlikely to have any further children. Under Salic law, where inheritance of territory was restricted to the male line, the succession of George and his brothers to the territories of their father and uncle now seemed secure. In 1682, the family agreed to adopt the principle of primogeniture, meaning George would inherit all the territory {{and not have to}} share it with his brothers.|$|E
5|$|None of {{them were}} {{particularly}} young. Tom Skerritt, the captain, was 46, Hurt was 39 <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> older, Holm was 48, Harry Dean Stanton was 53, Yaphet Kotto was 42, and only Veronica Cartwright at 30 and Weaver at 29 were in the age range of the usual thriller cast. Many recent action pictures have improbably young actors cast as key roles or sidekicks, but by skewing older, Alien achieves a certain texture without even making a point of it: These are not adventurers but workers, hired by a company to return 20million tons of ore to Earth.|$|E

5|$|On 17 February 1644, Jirgalang, who was {{a capable}} {{military}} leader <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> uninterested in managing state affairs, willingly yielded control of all official matters to Dorgon. After an alleged plot by Hooge to undermine the regency was exposed on 6 May of that year, Hooge was stripped of his title of Imperial Prince and his co-conspirators were executed. Dorgon soon replaced Hooge's supporters (mostly from the Yellow Banners) with his own, thus gaining closer control of two more Banners. By early June 1644, he was in firm control of the Qing government and its military.|$|E
5|$|The 1881 year-end {{retrospective}} of the Pacific Commercial Advertiser {{was focused on}} Kalākaua's journey. The newspaper took a wait-and-see attitude about what {{the impact of the}} tour would be, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> optimistically towards the kingdom having a more secure future as an independent nation. It gave much credit to Liliuokalani for rising to the occasion as a capable ruler who gained respect for her performance as temporary Regent. Kalākaua was acknowledged as having brought Hawaii to the forefront of the world's attention. He was praised for his personal qualities of leadership and personality, as well as for his positive interaction with global leaders. A smaller section in same day's newspaper noted that since the journey, there had been a global increase of literary publications pertaining to Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Pre-season for Plymouth Argyle {{began on}} 1 July 2009 {{when the first}} team squad {{returned}} to Harpers Park. A week of intense training followed, before the club's first match of the new season took place on 13 July 2009 against Cornish side Truro City. In a match which featured trialist Kári Árnason, Argyle scored a goal in each half to earn a comfortable win. A youthful Argyle team headed across the city of Plymouth {{the next day to}} take on Plymouth Parkway. The visitors fell behind to an early goal but responded with three of their own in an entertaining friendly, including a brace from Republic of Ireland youth international Joe Mason. The first team were in action again the next day, against Torquay United. The visitors went behind twice <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> like leaving Plainmoor with a win until Torquay converted a penalty in the 90th minute. The squad then departed for a tour of Scotland, and stopped off in the north of England on the way in order to play a friendly against Skelmersdale United on 18 July 2009. Argyle came away with a 2–0 win after scoring a goal in each half. A picturesque setting greeted the squad as they took to the field against Livingston on 20 July 2009. An 81st-minute penalty from Luke Summerfield wasn't enough to save Argyle from their first defeat of the season.|$|E

5|$|Sensing that {{he would}} have limited {{opportunities}} at Barcelona, Fàbregas joined Premier League club Arsenal in their Academy, signing for the London club on 11 September 2003. Initially, he found life difficult in England's capital but soon struck a friendship with Spanish-speaking teammate Philippe Senderos, who helped him settle down. As a 16-year-old, Fàbregas did not contemplate breaking into the first team immediately <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> up to senior players like Patrick Vieira and Gilberto Silva, while concentrating on training and learning the English language. He nevertheless made his debut for Arsenal not long after, on 28 October 2003, in a League Cup tie at home to Rotherham United. In doing so, he became Arsenal's youngest-ever first team player, aged 16 years and 177 days. He then became the youngest goalscorer in Arsenal's history in a later round of the League Cup, scoring in a 5–1 victory against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Although Arsenal {{went on to win the}} league unbeaten in the 2003–04 season, Fàbregas was not awarded a winner's medal because he did not play a single league game.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{decided to}} {{concentrate}} on the notes with the largest number in circulation, the £5. Samples of British notes were sent to technical colleges for analysis, which reported back that it was rag paper with no added cellulose. Naujocks and Langer realised that the paper would have to be handmade. The colour of the first samples differed from the original; the Germans had used new rags. After tests at the Hahnemühle paper factory, the rags were used by local factories and then cleaned before being used to make the paper; the colours of the counterfeit and original notes then matched. When the initial paper samples were produced, at a factory in Spechthausen, they looked identical to British notes in normal light, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> dull in ultraviolet light when compared to the originals. Langer surmised {{it was because of the}} chemical composition of the water used for making the paper and in the ink. He duplicated the chemical balance of British water in order to make the colours match.|$|E

25|$|The Quakes {{missed out}} on the playoffs for a second {{consecutive}} season in 2009 <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> to build on a solid {{second half of the}} year, which saw them go 4–4–4 since the All-Star Break. The Earthquakes finished in 14th place and failing to qualify for the playoffs. The Earthquakes also failed to qualify for the U.S. Open Cup, losing to New York Red Bulls on April 29, 2–1.|$|E
25|$|John Calvin's {{ideas about}} worship were {{influenced}} Martin Bucer and William Farel {{during his time}} in Strasbourg beginning in 1538. When he came to Geneva in 1536, Farel had already begun a Zwinglian reformation. His liturgy emphasized the unworthiness of the worshiper with the Ten Commandments being sung every Sunday, a practice probably taken from Martin Bucer. The service was also very didactic, with even the prayers written with the intention to instruct. Calvin did not insist on having explicit biblical precedents for every element of worship, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> to the early church as his model and retained whatever he considered edifying. The liturgy was entirely in the vernacular, and the people were {{to participate in the}} prayers.|$|E

25|$|The C-Lab programmers {{left that}} company to form Emagic, and in 1993 {{released}} a new program, Notator Logic, which attempted to fuse both track- and pattern-based operation (<b>but</b> <b>looked</b> {{much more like}} track-based sequencers than Notator). While rich in features, early versions of Logic on the Atari lacked the intuitiveness and immediacy of either Cubase or Notator, and never achieved the same success. However, {{by this time the}} Atari was becoming obsolete, and {{part of the reason why}} Notator Logic had been written from scratch with an object oriented GUI (though it shared the same nomenclature as its predecessor) was to make it easier to port to other platforms. The Notator preface was dropped from the product name and the software became known as simply Logic.|$|E
25|$|England won the toss {{and chose}} to field – a {{decision}} which looked correct {{as the new}} ball bowlers found plenty of movement of the pitch. However, they failed {{to take advantage of}} this situation, and the two wickets earned during the first session of play were due to lbw decisions that the batsmen could consider themselves unlucky to get out to. The biggest wicket of the day for England was that of Kumar Sangakkara, who pulled a ball out to deep square leg into the waiting hands of Monty Panesar. He had scored 46, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> set for a much larger score. At the end of the day’s play, Sri Lanka were 147/4, but with Mahela Jayawardene still at the crease.|$|E
25|$|In May 2016 Compton was {{announced}} in the England test squad for the first match against Sri Lanka. Many were suggesting {{that this would be}} his last chance for England, but he scored a first innings duck, after being caught behind of the bowling of debutant Dasun Shanaka. After England recorded an empathic victory in the first match, they named an unchanged side for the second and Compton kept his place for the second Test. He was dismissed for just nine in the first innings, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> in better touch in the second innings and scored an unbeaten 22 to help England to a nine wicket victory. In the final match of the series he was out for one in England's first innings, before making 19 in the second, as the match ended in a draw.|$|E
