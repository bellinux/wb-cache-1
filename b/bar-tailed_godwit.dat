5|$|Between {{the river}} {{mouth and the}} River Witham, a large expanse of {{saltmarsh}} provides breeding grounds for common redshank, Eurasian oystercatcher and reed bunting in the summer, and Eurasian wigeon, mallard, common shelduck and common teal in the winter. Birds of prey such as hen harrier and merlin feed on the flocks of linnet and twite, while the mudflats support dunlin, whimbrel, and <b>bar-tailed</b> <b>godwit.</b> The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust have a reserve there, which is next to RSPB Frampton Marsh, a reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E
5|$|Ruffs of {{both sexes}} have an {{additional}} moult stage between the winter and final summer plumages, a phenomenon also seen in the <b>bar-tailed</b> <b>godwit.</b> Before developing the full display finery with coloured ruff and tufts, the males replace part of their winter plumage with striped feathers. Females also develop a mix of winter and striped feathers before reaching their summer appearance. The final male breeding plumage results from the replacement of both winter and striped feathers, but the female retains the striped feathers and replaces only the winter feathers to reach her summer plumage. The striped prenuptial plumages may represent the original breeding appearance of this species, the male's showy nuptial feathers evolving later under strong sexual selection pressures.|$|E

Aims To determine the diet of <b>Bar-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> across their wintering range in Europe by {{the analysis of}} droppings, collected at five important wintering sites. Methods Diet was estimated by the identification of undigested prey remains in droppings. We provide the rationale for quantifying the contributions of jawed and non-jawed polychaetes. Results We identified 18 different prey species in the diet of wintering <b>Bar-tailed</b> <b>Godwits.</b> The Ragworm {{was the most common}} prey item and the only one actively selected. Ragworms, on average, contributed 79 % to the diet in terms of biomass, followed by King Ragworm Alitta virens (with 17 % biomass) and Lugworms Arenicola marina (with 2 %). Polychaetes such as Alitta succinea and Scoloplos armiger were also regularly found in the diet. Bivalves, snails and crustaceans contributed less than 1 % to the diet.

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} for the age-related distribution of <b>Bar-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> in Moreton Bay, Queensland, during the northward migration in 1989.

Males were concentrated on exposed mud flats, while females occurred more along the waterline. Also within these habitat types, the sexes associated with same-sex individuals.

40|$|Regular {{counts and}} {{catching}} of migrating <b>Bar-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> were {{conducted at the}} Gulf of Gdaæsk in years 1984 - 2000. The migration of adult birds lasted from mid-July to mid-September with a peak in the second decade of July. At the beginning, females were more numerous than males, then on the turn of July males outnumbered females. The proportion of females increased again {{in the second half}} of August and decreased in September. First young <b>Bar-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> arrived in small number in the third decade of July, but their regu-lar migration started in mid-August (single young birds were seen until the end of Novem-ber). The total numbers of migrants differed between seasons, reaching highest values every third year, which may have corresponded with lemming cycles on breeding grounds of the species. Low numbers of <b>Bar-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> stopping at the Gulf of Gdaæsk coast together with short length of stay and low number of retraps of adult birds proved that southern coast of the Baltic Sea was only an emergency stopover site for this species. Values of adults meas-urements were generally larger than those of juveniles what is connected with growth process still lasting in young birds. Within each age group bimodality was noticed due to sexual di-morphism females were significantly larger than males.

The most extreme migrations, traversing vast, inhospitable areas of the globe in protracted non-stop flights, may push birds {{to the limits of}} their capabilities, and would be expected to tolerate little variation in performance. Despite this, <b>Bar-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> Limosa lapponia baueri, which are among the world’s greatest endurance migrants, embark on northward migration from New Zealand across a month-long period, and individuals are quite faithful to their particular schedules. Godwits are highly sexually dimorphic in plumage and body size, and there is additionally substantial individual variation within each sex in both traits. These patterns demonstrate a surprising diversity of strategies within a system that should contain little room for error. In this thesis, I sought to identify the roots and consequences of both persistent and ephemeral individual differences in migration and moult of New Zealand <b>Bar-tailed</b> <b>Godwits,</b> and to identify constraints and potential bottlenecks in their annual cycle. To do this, I combined a fine-resolution multi-year focus on individuals and an entire annual-cycle perspective, both of which have generally been impossible in studies of long-distance migratory birds. At a single non-breeding site, I closely monitored moult and migration of individual <b>Bar-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> for three non-breeding seasons, and linked these with events outside of New Zealand by tracking a subset of the same individuals on their complete migrations to Alaska breeding grounds and back. I supplemented this by travelling to Alaska myself and describing how godwits are distributed by size and plumage across their vast breeding range. I found that most of the variation among individual <b>Bar-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> was linked to where they nested in Alaska: within each sex, northerly breeders were smaller, had more extensive breeding plumage, and migrated later on both northbound and southbound migrations. The differences in migration timing can be explained by variation in when tundra breeding sites become snow-free and available across a latitudinal gradient, but reasons for geographic differences in plumage and size are less clear. Variation in breeding plumage was associated with different strategies for scheduling moult, both in New Zealand and during northbound migratory stopover in the Yellow Sea. Individual godwits were extraordinarily consistent between years in their timing of departure from New Zealand, and most ‘off-schedule’ departures were attributable to birds avoiding unfavourable winds for migration. Surprisingly, timing of arrival in New Zealand after the longest recorded non-stop flight did not appear to influence a godwit’s ability to prepare for its next migration, as timing of subsequent migratory departure and extent of breeding plumage on departure were both unaffected and very consistent. Across the entire year, scheduling of events became more precisely timed as the breeding season approached, but movements were generally much more tightly scheduled than moults. These findings show that <b>Bar-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> adopt and enact an array of individualised strategies within an apparently constrained system. The inter-relationships among events {{in different parts of the}} globe show that an individual-based, full annual-cycle perspective is required to understand patterns in any particular season. The consistent manner in which godwits conduct their annual routines, while still demonstrating flexibility to address unforeseen circumstances, challenges us to reconsider the view of extreme long-distance migrants as organisms operating at the limits of their capabilities...|$|R

40|$|Male <b>Bar-tailed</b> <b>Godwits</b> of the Afrosiberian {{population}} (L. lapponica taymirensis) use the Wadden Sea as a stopover {{site from}} migration where they replenish their fuel load and molt further into breeding plumage. In this thesis triggers influencing timing of males are explored {{in the light}} of decision making and trade-offs. An interaction between fuel load and molt exists. Wind has to be studied in the future and plays thus far no role in timing. There are more males in this species and it is suggested that males depart earlier. Proximate factors that underlie timing of male birds, obtaining a territory and growing a fresh feather pack in order to gain a female, could certainly play a role in <b>Bar-tailed</b> <b>Godwits.</b> Decisions are made by use of an interplay of several ultimate factors (weight and molt) sustained by proximate factors (competition for a mate, a tight migration scheme).

We compared these data with data on body composition of godwits of the smaller lapponica subspecies obtained during a northward stopover in The Netherlands.
