40|$|Trading {{enterprises}} are {{the most}} numerous and classified according to their features. Types of stores are constantly changed {{under the influence of}} the economical processes, scientific and technological progress, social factors, which altogether encourage the new trade and technological processes of the trade objects. The purpose of the article is to research the economic activity of the trade enterprises and to form the scheme of trade and technological processes of the contemporary trade kinds. To achieve the set goal, the trading sites were reviewed, the trade and technological processes of the stationary and non-stationary trading objects were studied, and their structure was defined. The research proved that the establishment of the efficient economic activity of the trade enterprise in the market economics is only possible with the firm and perfect form of the economic activity organization. For this purpose, it is necessary to define clearly the scheme of trade and technological processes of the merchandise distribution at every enterprise. The structure of trade and technological processes depends on the type of the trade, enterprise and its organizational structure. Some schemes of trade and technological processes for the stationary objects of trade and objects of trade at the <b>buyer's</b> <b>location</b> are suggested. The result of the research showed that it is appropriate to establish the trade and technological process of an enterprise by the phases of the merchandise distribution: the operations with merchandise before offering to the buyers; the operations of the direct service of the buyers, the supplementary operations of the buyers' service. The economic activity of the trade enterprise requires the timely informational provision of the merchandise distribution that enables to make quick and strategic management decisions, therefore, finding the merchandise distribution scheme is the important part of improving organization enhancement and management of the trade enterprise. The basic information supply of the enterprises economic activity is the accounting economic data as the management function along with the planning (budgeting), controlling, analyzing and forecasting. Every trade and technological process is executed with the corresponding primary document. The availability of the primary documents determines the existence of the other elements of economic accounting system. Therefore, the usage of trade and technological processes scheme is the main factor to improve accounting and information supply of the trade operations management of the enterprises...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} model of {{monetary}} exchange that avoids several common criticisms of the recent microfoundations literature. First, rather than random matching, we assume that <b>buyers</b> know the <b>location</b> of all sellers, and hence the process of finding a partner is deterministic, although trade is still stochastic since the number of buyers visiting a given seller is random. Second, given multilateral matching, rather than bargaining, we assume that goods are allocated according to second-price auctions. Third, given this mechanism, {{we do not have}} to assume agents can observe each other’s money holdings or preferences, as is necessary for tractability with bargaining. A novel result is that homogeneous buyers hold different amounts of money, leading to equilibrium price dispersion. We find the closed-form solution for the distribution of money holdings. We characterize equilibrium and efficient monetary policy. Search Theory of Money, Budget Constrained Auctions, Friedman Rule...|$|R

The system contains datasets that include property details, sales dates and sale prices. The records contain land area for house transactions but not for unit transactions. Furthermore, the system stores no information {{as to how the}} houses sold, by auction or private treaty, and no further housing attribute information is available from the system. Home <b>buyers</b> consider <b>location</b> as a major factor when deciding their preference to purchase in a specific area.

The study will utilise two major datasets of spatial attributes. The first set is the property location attributes such as orientation, height, aspect, frontage and street hierarchy. The second set is the property linkage defined as the proximity of a particular location and ease of access to major shopping centres, transportation nodes, schools and the Central Business District. This paper reports the process of creating a dataset of the spatial location for each housing transaction record and applying this attribute to the transaction record thereby improving the useability of this latter data for graphical display, querying and spatial analysis.

40|$|Since the {{container}} {{was introduced in}} the 1950 s, the market and users of container grown significantly. Between 1990 - 2012 {{the container}} fleet grew with about 25 million TEUs. Container shipping market and changed shipping companies constellations are constantly effecting shippers and their transportation planning. Whether cargo owners argue about the choice of shipping ports in Sweden and thus the choice of transport provider will be important information for the transportation industry and its future. An argument that today is relevant is the situation between if shipping companies call a port directly or via feeder traffic. The purpose of this report is to from a transport buyer’s perspective analyze the possible competitive advantages, limited to possible gain in total transportation time and environmental benefits related to the SECA area, as a direct port call to the APM Terminals in the Port of Gothenburg, the only port with direct port calls in Sweden, may obtain against the other three largest container ports in Sweden on the Sweden - South East Asia trade. By defining the transportation route from Sweden to Singapore there is ability to reach a concrete result. Parameters that are identified and addressed in the report are transport <b>buyer's</b> geographic <b>location,</b> trucking, rail transport, shipping, terminal operations and bunker consumption in the SECA area. The report use both qualitative and quantitative data and information that the report is mainly based on are collected from telephone interviews with shippers and e-mail correspondence with persons engaged in the maritime cluster. Results from the interviews with the transport buyers and our earlier collected facts through literature studies have then been analyzed according to a SWOT analysis. In summary the analysis show that there are both strengths and weaknesses with a direct port call to the Port of Gothenburg, but external threats and opportunities will also be factors involved for the final result. Strengths, opportunities, weaknesses and threats have been discussed so that we finally could be able to draw a conclusion to the question at issue. The report is written in Swedish...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises three essays {{that study}} online demand coming from local offline markets. In the first essay, I study two social influence effects reflected in physical proximity and in demographic similarity, respectively, on online demand evolution. As these {{effects can be}} time-varying, I specify their dynamics using a polynomial smoother embedded within the Bayesian framework. Using new buyers at Netgrocer. com in Pennsylvania, I find that the proximity effect is especially strong in the early phases of demand evolution, whereas the similarity effect becomes more important with time. In the second essay, I study social influence effects emanating from two types of buyers in the installed base—search buyers, those acquired by online search, and WOM buyers, those acquired by offline word-of-mouth (WOM) —on online demand evolution. Since Internet retailers acquire <b>buyers</b> from multiple <b>locations</b> over time, I allow time-varying parameters to also vary across counties. Using data on new buyers at Childcorp. com, I find that WOM buyers are on average of “better quality”, however, substantial variation in the temporal parameter paths over counties suggests {{that a third of}} the markets are better able to breed social influence from search buyers. In the third essay, I examine how online demand in a location is affected by the relative size of the target population holding the absolute size constant. I hypothesize that in regions where this target group is in the minority online category sales wil...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurpose - Marketing {{channels}} are changing dramatically {{as the world}} economy becomes networked. Buyers {{who are likely to}} only have limited insight into a wholesaler's sourcing decisions may be uncertain about product and/or service quality. This study is the first to show that a credible quality signal provided by the wholesaler, the wholesale brand, can effectively reduce buyer uncertainty. Methodology/approach - Using structural equation modelling methodology in the context of 569 <b>buyers</b> across 52 <b>locations</b> of a home improvement wholesaler we investigate the key mediating role of transaction costs for the effect of wholesale brand knowledge on buyer loyalty. Findings - Our results suggests that wholesaler brand knowledge effectively reduces ex-post transaction costs incurred by the buyer. These lower quality control costs and price verification efforts increase buyer loyalty. Interestingly, however, our data shows that this bonding effect of the wholesale brand may not affect buyer search costs. Research implications / limitations - Our research on the role of supplier brands for supply network management is an early effort. Clearly {{more research is needed to}} fully explore the role of wholesale brand knowledge for wholesaler selection. Practical implications - Our findings are important to marketing channel managers because we provide a viable alternative to ever-increasing relationship marketing costs. We suggest that a close wholesaler-retailer relationship may not be necessary to realize the benefits of a trusting exchange environment. In fact, we show that high wholesale brand knowledge may act as a substitute and reduce uncertainty effectively. Originality/value - This paper is the first to introduce a transaction cost perspective on the relationship between wholesale brand knowledge and wholesale loyalty. We demonstrate how wholesale brand knowledge can reduce uncertainty in the wholesaler-retailer dyad and substitute for more costly relationship building efforts...|$|R
40|$|A {{conventional}} wisdom regarding search models is that multiple unemployment equilibrium may result if the matching function has increasing returns to scale. Essays {{one and two}} challenge this view in models where projects are homogenous but the job seekers and firms choose their search intensities (essay one), or the job seekers choose their search intensity but firms enter the market according to a zero-profit condition (essay two). Multiple equilibrium may in principle be caused by strategic complementarity or by common pool externality. It turns out that large returns to scale do not endanger uniqueness but rather guarantee it. In directed search models, the identity of stayers and movers has traditionally been just assumed. In essay three, searching and waiting decisions of buyers and sellers are considered. One-sided search is an evolutionarily stable outcome in an economy where each buyer and seller can either search or wait, and where the trading mechanism is auction or bargaining. If the relative number of buyers to sellers increases, the likelihood of all sellers wait and all buyers search -equilibrium increases relative to the likelihood of all buyers wait and all sellers search -equilibrium. In two-sided search, bargaining is more efficient than auction. One-sided search is more efficient than two-sided search. In one-sided search, it is more efficient if the larger pool searches and the smaller pool waits, than vice versa. We can often see that similar goods are sold for different prices, which violates the law of one price. Up to now, the models resulting in price distribution have assumed imperfect information on prices or ex ante heterogenous agents. In the model of essay four, we develop a search model where price distribution results even if all the sellers are symmetric, all the buyers are symmetric, the commodity is homogenous, and all the buyers know all the prices. The sellers are in locations and post prices simultaneously. The buyers observe the prices, and each <b>buyer</b> visits one <b>location.</b> The <b>buyers</b> act independently and employ symmetric mixed strategies. We show that when there are several sellers in a location, the Nash equilibrium features price dispersion, i. e. the sellers post different prices. The equilibrium strategy of the sellers is a non-atomic distribution. Essay five studies the supply of pollution permits in a labor market -style search model. We look at economic implications of allowing pollution permit trading between developed countries (DC) and less developed countries (LDC). The firms in a given region are similar, but he DC-firms are assumed to have clean technology, whereas the LDC-firms have dirty technology that emits a lot of carbon dioxide. We assume that each firm in both regions is first allocated a pollution cap. However, the permits can be transfered by making an investment which reduces the emission rate for a host firm (in an LDC-country) below the host's permit endowment. The market for these emissions-reducing projects have friction: finding a suitable partner for a project takes time. Once emission reductions are made and verified, the permits are traded in a frictionless permit market. Our model combines the search market for projects with a frictionless permit market to quantify the supply-side frictions in the market. We also decompose the effects of frictions into the effects of search friction, bargaining, and bilateralism. A calibration using previous cost estimates of reductions illustrates changes in cost savings and allocative implication...|$|R
40|$|We {{will find}} ways of getting by without cheap oil and coal, argues John Quiggin BACK in July the Howard {{government}} announced, with some fanfare, {{the formation of the}} Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development, a six-country agreement presented variously as an alternative or a complement to the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change. The agreement involved no commitment targets for reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, or market-based incentives for more efficient use of energy, preferring instead to focus on technological solutions. No concrete proposals were announced, and observers of the climate change issue have been waiting with interest for the first meeting of the group which, it was announced, would be held in Adelaide in November. Now, however, it appears that the meeting has been postponed or abandoned, and the government is saying there was never a formal commitment to hold such a meeting. The cynical interpretation is obvious enough. The purpose of the pact, in this interpretation, was to prevent action on Kyoto by raising the prospect of alternative initiatives. Holding a meeting requires some actual commitments, and therefore has to be deferred as long as possible. A more charitable interpretation is that, while the major parties were agreed on what {{they did not want to}} do (impose effective targets for reducing emissions), they have found it more difficult to reach an agreement on what they do want to do. While we wait to see what, if anything comes out of the Asia-Pacific Partnership, it’s worth re-examining the premise on which it is based, namely that with current technology it would be prohibitively costly to achieve the kinds of reductions in emissions needed to stabilise atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and therefore, ultimately, global climate. The economy, it is assumed, cannot function without ample supplies of cheap energy. It is not surprising to see the Chinese government (still nominally communist) taking this line. The representation of technology in terms of recipes with fixed proportions of each input being essential is a central feature of old-fashioned Marxist economics, as is disregard for and distrust of price mechanisms. Lenin’s dictum that ‘Communism is Soviet power plus electrification’ is still influential, even if, in practice, capitalism is the goal nowadays. But for anyone who takes mainstream economics seriously, the idea that a physical resource like oil or coal is essential to prosperity must be regarded as fallacious. Economic theory teaches, and economic history has repeatedly shown, that when one resource becomes scarce, others are substituted to take its place. Some of these effects are immediate, but others take place over much longer periods of time. For example, an increase in petrol prices may cause some drivers to take fewer trips or switch to public transport. But the full effects will be felt only over a span of decades. Assuming higher prices are sustained, car buyers will switch to more fuel-efficient models (which manufacturers will have an incentive to develop), and home <b>buyers</b> will seek <b>locations</b> closer to work. The car fleet turns over in about 20 years, and the housing stock takes even longer. Economists measure such responses in terms of the price elasticity of demand. Econometric studies of energy demand tend to show a low elasticity, which explains some of the pessimism discussed above. But the ‘long run’ in such studies is typically only five years. The important responses to changes in energy prices are slower than this, suggesting that if the long run is measured over decades, energy demand will prove to be elastic. A standard calculation suggests that if carbon-based fuels account for about 8 per cent of GDP at current prices, and the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1 in the very long term, a doubling of the effective price of carbon will eventually produce a reduction in emissions of 60 per cent, at a welfare cost of around 3 per cent of GDP or one year’s economic growth. We don’t need to rely on theoretical exercises like this, however, to demonstrate the capacity of the economy to handle price shocks. The world price of oil has tripled over the past few years, and the economic impact has been marginal. Admittedly, this increase arose from demand pressures rather than from a gradual policy-imposed increase in prices, but the example is still relevant. When the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development finally meets, its members will no doubt have much to say about technological solutions to climate change. They should not, however, ignore the power of market-based instruments. • Professor John Quiggin is a federation fellow in economics and political science based at the University of Queensland and the Australian National University.
