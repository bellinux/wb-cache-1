5|$|Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) {{learns that}} a new life {{insurance}} policy has <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> in her name, by Josie Packard (Joan Chen) and Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer). Martell had been planning with Horne to burn down Packard's sawmill in order to cheaply purchase the land it occupies. Packard speaks to Horne over the telephone, cooperating with the sawmill arson, but arranging to burn it down with Martell inside. As Packard hangs up, it is seen that the recently paroled killer Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey) has been beside her.|$|E
5|$|The 1687 {{earthquake}} {{marked a}} turning point in the history of Lima as it coincided with a recession in trade, a reduction of silver production and economic competition by other cities such as Buenos Aires. To add to these problems, on October 28, 1746, a powerful earthquake severely damaged the city and destroyed Callao, forcing a massive rebuilding effort under Viceroy José Antonio Manso de Velasco. This disaster led to an intense devotion for an image of Christ called The Lord of the Miracles, which has <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> in procession every October since 1746.|$|E
50|$|An {{attractive}} {{feature of}} the festival is the Garuda Vahanam, where the main deity placed on the idol of Garuda <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> in procession on a richly decorated palanquin that resembles the one on which Lord Vishnu <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> during the Theerthavari at the Padmanabhaswamy temple.

5|$|Store Norske {{underwent}} a gradual change during the 1980s. Since 1980, Spitsbergen money has <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of circulation {{and replaced with}} ordinary Norwegian currency. Mine 6 closed the following year. From 1982, SNSK permitted private individuals to own and operate cars. By 1990, there were 353 registered cars and 883 snowscooters. On 1 July 1983, SNSK moved its head office from Bergen to Longyearbyen. Svalbard Samfunnsdrift (SSD), a limited company that was responsible for public infrastructure and services, was established by SNSK on 1 January 1989. Responsibilities included healthcare, the fire brigade, the kindergarten, roads, rubbish disposal, power production, the water and sewer system, the cinema, cultural actives and the library. Ownership {{was taken over by}} the Ministry of Trade and Industry on 1 January 1993.|$|E
5|$|The album's cover was, like {{several other}} Pink Floyd albums, {{designed}} by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. It {{consists of a}} photograph of a man sitting in a tree which has <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of focus to the point of complete distortion. Hipgnosis viewed a number of stills from the film on a 35mm projector, and liked the visual effect when the slide jammed. Schroeder later said the band did not want to make the cover particularly good as The Dark Side of the Moon would have to compete with it, but Thorgerson insisted it was given proper consideration like any other Floyd album.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrinsic}} green luminescence of the cookiecutter shark is {{the strongest}} known of any shark, and {{has been reported to}} persist for three hours after it has <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of water. The ventrally positioned photophores serve to disrupt its silhouette from below by matching the downwelling light, a strategy known as counter-illumination, that is common among bioluminescent organisms of the mesopelagic zone. The individual photophores are set around the denticles and are small enough that they cannot be discerned by the naked eye, suggesting they have evolved to fool animals with high visual acuity and/or at close distances.|$|E

5|$|The Trojans next {{faced the}} Washington State Cougars, led by third–year head coach Bill Doba and quarterback Alex Brink. The Trojans took an early lead on a Leinart {{touchdown}} pass to Dwayne Jarrett, but the Cougars answered twominutes later on a Jerome Harrison rush for a touchdown. After the Cougars missed the extra point, the Trojans scored three more touchdowns in the first quarter, with a fumble recovery {{in the end zone}} and two more Leinart touchdown passes, to take a 28–6 lead. Late in the second quarter the Trojans scored again on a LenDale White touchdown rush, and a Mario Danelo field goal as time was expiring gave them a 38–6 half-time lead. The Trojans would get another Danelo field goal and a second White touchdown rush before the Cougars would rush for their second touchdown. With a final rushing touchdown after the starters had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of the game, the Trojans won 55–13 and increased their winning streak to 30games.|$|E
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, Clifton Bridge {{came under the}} aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. Services had reduced by 1949 to 13 trains per day on weekdays and seven on Sundays, and passenger numbers fell. The station became an unstaffed halt from 29 October 1962, and in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line. Passenger services at Clifton Bridge were ended on 7 September 1964, with goods services ending the next year on 5 July 1965. In the final year of passenger operation, there were only six trains on weekdays and none on Sundays. One of the carriage sidings had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service in 1964, and the others followed in 1966. The line through the site was reduced to single track in 1965, and the signal box was closed on 4 November 1966. The station buildings were mostly demolished, and the site became the headquarters of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary Mounted Police and Dog Section. Part of the western platform remained in situ, as did the retaining wall of the eastern platform shelter. The station footbridge became part of a footpath. Freight trains continued to pass through the station, but their number decreased over time, with the line falling out of regular use from 30 March 1981. The route however was kept intact by British Rail, with occasional freight trains, and in 2002 a single track was relaid to allow rail access to Royal Portbury Dock.|$|E

25|$|Gold {{was being}} {{withdrawn}} from the U.S. by England and silver had also <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of the country {{because it had been}} under valued relative to gold by the Coinage Act of 1834.
