As mentioned above, Raman scattering from CNTs is resonant in nature, i.e. only tubes whose band gap energy {{is similar to the}} laser energy are excited. The difference between those two energies, and thus the band gap of individual tubes, can be estimated from the intensity ratio of the Stokes/anti-Stokes lines. This estimate however relies on the temperature factor (<b>Boltzmann</b> <b>factor),</b> which is often miscalculated – a focused laser beam is used in the measurement, which can locally heat the nanotubes without changing the overall temperature of the studied sample.|$|E
25|$|Most {{familiar}} systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always {{increases their}} entropy. However, some systems have a {{maximum amount of}} energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease. Because temperature {{is defined by the}} relationship between energy and entropy, such a system's temperature becomes negative, even though energy is being added. As a result, the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>factor</b> for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy. Therefore, no complete system, i.e. including the electromagnetic modes, can have negative temperatures, since there is no highest energy state , so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures. However, for quasi-equilibrium systems (e.g. spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field) this argument does not apply, and negative effective temperatures are attainable.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the q -> 1 /q duality in an information-entropy theory of all q-generalized entropy functionals (Tsallis, Renyi and Sharma-Mittal measures) in the light of a representation based on generalized exponential and logarithm functions subjected to Kolmogorov's and Nagumo's averaging. We show that it is precisely in this representation that the form invariance of all entropy functionals is maintained under the action of this duality. The generalized partition function also results to be a scalar invariant under the q -> 1 /q transformation which can be interpreted as a non-extensive two dimensional Ising model duality between systems governed by two different power law long-range interactions and temperatures.

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the computed structure, energies, vibrational absorption (VA) and circular dichroism (VCD) spectra of 30 low-energy conformers of dehydroquinidine reveals the existence of families of pseudo-conformers, the structures of which differ mostly in the orientation of a single O[BOND]H bond. The pseudo-conformers in a family are separated by very small energy barriers (i. e., 1. 0  kcal[*]mol− 1 or smaller) and have very different VCD spectra. First, we demonstrate the unreliable character of the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>factors</b> predicted with DFT. Then, we show that the large differences observed between the VCD spectra of the pseudo-conformers in a family are caused by large-amplitude motions involving the O[BOND]H bond, which trigger the appearance/disappearance of strong VCD exciton-coupling bands in the fingerprint region. This interplay between exciton coupling and large-amplitude-motion phenomena demonstrates that when dealing with flexible molecules with polar bonds, vibrational averaging of VCD spectra should not be neglected.

40|$|Abstract. Heat kernel {{expansions}} at finite {{temperature of}} massless QCD and chiral quark models generate effective actions relevant for both {{low and high}} temperature QCD. The key relevance of the Polyakov Loop to maintain the large and non-perturbative gauge invariance at finite temperature is stressed. In the imaginary time formulation of quantum field theory [1], finite temperature is introduced by imposing periodic or anti-periodic boundary conditions for bosons and fermions respectively. This approach necessarily breaks the Lorentz invariance of the starting Lagrangian since the heat bath is a static infinitely heavy system which {{is assumed to be}} at rest and communicates energy at no expense with the fundamental degrees of freedom. This fact generates an unpleasant plethora of possible Lorentz contributions to Feynman diagrams which fortunately are ultraviolet finite due to the presence of suppressing kinetic <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>factors.</b> As a gratifying consequence, the finite temperature renormalizability of a theory relies indeed on its renormalizability at zero temperature and provides any fundamental theory with definite predictive power, if the parameters entering the Lagrangian are assumed to be temperature independent...|$|R
