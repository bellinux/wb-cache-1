McCosker and Timothy C.

25|$|The {{use of the}} <b>buddy</b> <b>system</b> by scuba divers is {{intended}} to improve their chances of avoiding or surviving accidents in or under water by diving together in a close group of two or sometimes three divers, and co-operating with each other, to help or rescue {{each other in the}} event of an emergency.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} effectiveness of the <b>buddy</b> support <b>system</b> on teacher parent collaboration and students’ social interaction in special education in Malaysia. Until recently, there has been growing awareness of the powerful influence a peer group can have in supporting inclusion. The study will explore teachers’ and parents’ understanding of special educational practices, their willingness to communicate with each other, their perceived roles as well as their expectations of each other in which these elements were deemed vital in a collaboration process that encourages students’ social interaction while {{the effectiveness of}} the <b>Buddy</b> Support <b>System</b> as a moderator is investigated in this collaboration process. This study adopted a sequential mixed method design, where quantitative data was collected using teachers’ and parents’ questionnaires which highlights the elements and importance of collaboration for a successful special education programme, the elements of friendship, interactions, acceptance by classmates, the importance of social interaction of young students with special needs, and the elements of {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>buddy</b> support <b>system.</b> Two types of statistical techniques were used to analyze the quantitative data. Descriptive statistics comprising mean and standard deviation were used to analyze data relating to the domains of teacher-parent collaboration, students’ social interaction among SEN and mainstream pupils and the effectiveness of the <b>buddy</b> support <b>system</b> as perceived by teachers and parents. Inferential statistics comprising Pearson's R Correlation was used to analyze the relationship between teacher-parent collaboration and students’ social interaction as perceived by the teachers and parents. PROCESS procedure for SPSS (Hayes, 2013) was used to determine whether the <b>buddy</b> support <b>system</b> significantly moderates the relationship between teacher-parent collaboration and students’ social interaction in the implementation of special educational practices. Results showed that the teachers rated   iv  themselves highest on the understanding about SEN while parents rated themselves highest on the expectations of teachers’ role in the implementation of SEN. Both teachers and parents rated the acceptance by classmates domain the highest in students’ social interaction among SEN and mainstream pupils. Teachers rated the influence and benefit domain of the <b>buddy</b> support <b>system</b> the highest while parents rated highest on the influence domain of the <b>buddy</b> support <b>system.</b> Hierarchical multiple linear regression results were able to confirm that by controlling the <b>Buddy</b> Support <b>System</b> variables (moderators), teacher-parent collaboration domain did not significantly predict the students’ social interaction domains, which accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in students’ social interaction. Emerging themes from the qualitative data supports the quantitative data results.

The player is able to spawn next to his buddy so long as the buddy remains alive and out of combat. With the aim of making the multiplayer more flexible and accessible, several logistical improvements have been added, such as the capability to join games in progress or for two different PlayStation Network accounts to play together in split-screen multiplayer on a single console.

2500|$|The main charge {{made against}} the <b>buddy</b> <b>system</b> as practiced {{is that it}} has been grossly overrated as a means of risk mitigation. Critics say that the <b>buddy</b> <b>system</b> acts as a crutch to give {{unjustified}} confidence to divers who individually do not have either the skills or the discipline to adequately deal with any real diving problems. This creates a situation where divers become dependent on the [...] "security blanket" [...] of being with another diver. The reality may be that the buddy diver on which many divers depend is often no better able to handle an emergency than the dependent buddy. The fostering of this false security by diving agencies that overemphasise the effectiveness of the <b>buddy</b> <b>system,</b> develops a sense of complacency in divers about their capability to deal with these problems, a capability which they often do not have. This complacency holds divers back from focusing on improving their lifesaving skills and capabilities.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{increased}} popularity of solo diving {{as a possible}} alternative to the <b>buddy</b> <b>system</b> there has been debate as to what really constitutes safe diving practise and how divers can best control {{the risks associated with}} their sport.

40|$|With {{bullying}} occurring {{more frequently}} in the school environment {{it is imperative to}} reflect and review what interventions better address the issue. This article examines the importance of attachment in understanding the dimensions of antisocial behaviour. A qualitative case study including student and teacher participants from a country secondary college in northern Victoria, revealed that a connection exists between school attachment and antisocial behaviour. Drawing on the theoretical principles associated with control theory, if students do not feel connected to school, they do not value the same rules as that institution, but rather appreciate the benefits that are associated with bullying. Thus interventions such as detention, suspension and expulsion are not effective when dealing with bullying as they remove the student from a structured environment and further decrease their attachment to school. Conversely interventions such as sporting activities, house <b>systems</b> and <b>buddy</b> <b>systems</b> are beneficial for reducing antisocial behaviour within schools. Such programs can assist in the development of personal and social growth; allow different year levels to work together and promote strong school values and attachment, which aid in creating a safe school environment. The importance of positive attachment in developing interventions provides a more proactive and hands on approach to dealing with antisocial behaviour...|$|R

30|$|A {{point of}} {{convergence}} among researchers is the acknowledgment that children’s involvement in structured school or community activities reduces behavioral and emotional problems, particularly in {{children living in}} high-risk environments, for example, poverty-ridden and high-crime neighborhoods (Law et al. 2007; Boon et al. 2011). Mutch (2013) proposed a continuum of engagement of children in research on, about, with, and by children, while Peek and Stough (2010) emphasized the need for their active involvement and consideration in all DRR activities to mitigate disaster effects. Useful DRR programs can involve children in mapping risks in their school, and undertaking hazard minimization strategies and disaster simulation (Wisner 2006; Mutch 2013). Participation in such activities provides children with the challenge to not only come up with local solutions, but to recognize and seek necessary external support. That means {{that some of the}} activities they may participate in could include identifying evacuation routes and equipment, potential hazards, alert and communication methods, and as trained assistants for individuals with disabilities. The advantage is that schools have been found to encourage participation by promoting caring relationships, <b>buddy</b> <b>systems</b> among peers, and welcoming attitudes (Law et al. 2007; Mutch 2014). This positions schools as strategic entry-points for research that involves the role of children with disabilities in the DRR agenda (Wisner 2006).|$|R
