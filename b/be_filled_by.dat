5|$|Generally, the {{organization}} of JG 1 followed the standard Luftwaffe organization for any typical wing (Geschwader). It was commanded by a Geschwaderkommodore, equivalent to a USAAF Wing Commander or RAF Group Captain. A Geschwaderkommodore {{was supposed to have}} the rank of Lieutenant Colonel (Oberstleutnant) or Colonel (Oberst), but the position could <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> a relatively junior officer.|$|E
5|$|Penrose {{originally}} {{discovered the}} P1 tiling in this way, by decomposing a pentagon into six smaller pentagons (one {{half of a}} net of a dodecahedron) and five half-diamonds; he then observed that when he repeated this process the gaps between pentagons could all <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> stars, diamonds, boats and other pentagons. By iterating this process indefinitely he obtained {{one of the two}} P1 tilings with pentagonal symmetry.|$|E

5|$|The sole {{content of}} Article III is the {{statement}} regarding separation of powers. The three branches (executive, judicial, and legislative) are created and defined. No individual can be affiliated {{with more than}} one unless the Constitution explicitly allows it. Before the constitution was amended, a vacancy in the Governor of New Jersey would <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> the president of the New Jersey Senate, who would retain their Senate seat.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this time}} Johann Bernoulli's two sons, Daniel and Nicolaus, were {{working at the}} Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg. On 31 July 1726, Nicolaus died of {{appendicitis}} after spending {{less than a year}} in Russia, and when Daniel assumed his brother's position in the mathematics/physics division, he recommended that the post in physiology that he had vacated <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> his friend Euler. In November 1726 Euler eagerly accepted the offer, but delayed making the trip to Saint Petersburg while he unsuccessfully applied for a physics professorship at the University of Basel.|$|E
5|$|As the stallions of the Poitevin breed {{could not}} be used to produce mules, they were {{generally}} sold as two-year-olds at the summer fair in Vendée and the winter fair in Saint-Maixent, as well as to horse merchants in Berry, Beauce, Perche and the Midi. In these areas, they were used for agriculture. In Paris, they were used for pulling omnibuses, and the French military used the Poitevin for pulling artillery. At the beginning of the 21st century there has been a new demand for mules for leisure purposes, but this demand cannot <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> Poitevin mares until their numbers have recovered to a sufficient level.|$|E

5|$|Corzine, in {{attempting}} to pass his conceptual budget, came into conflict with fellow state Democrats in the New Jersey General Assembly, particularly over their refusal to implement his proposed increase of the state's sales tax from 6% to 7% to fill a $4.5 billion budget gap. Corzine maintained that the gap could not <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> any other means due to the state's constitution and a ruling of New Jersey's Supreme Court. Long before the deadline date, Corzine had stated {{that he would not}} accept a budget that did not include a sales tax increase. Due to Corzine's insistence, the state's General Assembly, which was dominated by Democrats, refused to pass a budget before the deadline.|$|E
5|$|If a {{representative}} is absent for whatever reason, {{his or her}} seat will <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> a candidate from the same party-list—in other words, there are no by-elections. Representatives who die during the term are replaced permanently, whereas representatives who are appointed to a government position, such as government minister (cabinet member) or state secretary, {{will be replaced by}} a deputy representative until the representative no longer holds the government position. Deputy representatives also meet during typically short-term absence, like when {{a representative}} travels abroad with a parliamentary work group or is absent for health reasons.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 and 2007, the {{qualifying}} format {{allowed for}} {{eight of the}} twenty available positions to <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> automatic qualification, as the eight quarter finalists of the previous tournament enter its successor. The remaining twelve positions were filled by continental qualifying tournaments. Positions were filled by three teams from the Americas, one from Asia, one from Africa, three from Europe and two from Oceania. Another two places were allocated for repechage. The first repechage place was determined by a match between the runners-up from the Africa and Europe qualifying tournaments, with that winner then playing the Americas runner-up to determine the place. The second repechage position was determined between the runners-up from the Asia and Oceania qualifiers.|$|E

5|$|It {{was only}} in 1946, after the Japanese Occupation and the {{disbanding}} of the Straits Settlements, that the people were allowed to elect members into the Legislative Council. The Council then consisted of at least 22 {{but not more than}} 24 members. Only nine members were elected, out of which the Singapore Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Indian Chamber of Commerce were each allotted one seat. The other six seats were to <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> democratic elections based on universal suffrage. Elections were held {{for the first time on}} 20 March 1948.|$|E
5|$|The British Commandos {{were formed}} during the Second World War in June 1940, {{following}} {{a request from}} the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, for a force that could carry out raids against German-occupied Europe. Initially drawn from within the British Army from soldiers who volunteered for the Special Service Brigade, the Commandos' ranks would eventually <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> members of all branches of the British Armed Forces {{and a number of}} foreign volunteers from German-occupied countries.|$|E
5|$|The current format {{allows for}} 12 of the 20 {{available}} positions to <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> automatic qualification, as the teams who finish third or {{better in the}} group (pool) stages of the previous tournament enter its successor (where they will be seeded). The qualification system for the remaining eight places is region-based, with a total eight teams allocated for Europe, five for Oceania, three for the Americas, two for Africa, and one for Asia. The last place is determined by an intercontinental play-off.|$|E

5|$|The historians Tacitus and Suetonius {{record the}} funeral and posthumous honors of Germanicus. His name was placed into the Carmen Saliare, {{and onto the}} Curule chairs that were placed with oaken garlands over them as honorary seats for the Augustan priesthood. His ivory statue was {{at the head of}} the {{procession}} during the Circus Games; his posts as priest of Augustus and Augur were to <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> members of the imperial family; knights of Rome gave his name to a block of seats at a theatre in Rome, and rode behind his effigy on 15 July AD 20.|$|E
5|$|The state {{constitution}} had come under considerable criticism {{beginning in the}} 1840s because it allowed most government positions to <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> appointment. The problem with this method of filling positions did not manifest itself until {{the advent of the}} state's political parties. Once in power, a party could stack the government with its own members, making it difficult for the minority to regain power. Another problem was that the authority for many trivial issues were not delegated to other authorities. For example, if a man was to divorce his wife, the divorce bill had to be approved by the General Assembly before he or she could legally remarry.|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{election}} as a {{delegate to the}} Second Continental Congress created a vacancy in Fairfax County's delegation to the third Virginia Convention, and he wrote from Philadelphia in May 1775, urging that it <b>be</b> <b>filled.</b> <b>By</b> this time, blood had been shed between colonial and Briton at the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Mason attempted to avoid election {{on the grounds of}} poor health and that he was needed to parent his motherless children. Nevertheless, he was elected and journeyed to Richmond, which, being further inland than Williamsburg, was deemed better protected from possible British attack.|$|E

5|$|Elected {{with support}} from the Farmers' Alliance {{and as a result of}} {{agricultural}} protest, Tillman was thought likely to join the Populists in their challenge to the established parties. Tillman refused, and generally opposed Populist positions that went beyond his program of increasing access to higher education and reform of the Democratic Party (white supremacy was not a Populist position). The Alliance (and Populists) demanded a system of subtreasuries under the federal government, that could accept farmers' crops and advance them 80 percent of the value interest-free. Tillman, not wanting more federal officeholders in the state (that in Republican administrations might <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> African Americans), initially opposed the proposal. Many farmers felt strongly about this issue, and in 1891, Tillman was censured by the state Alliance for his opposition. Attuned to political necessities, Tillman gradually came to support the subtreasuries in time for his re-election campaign in 1892, though he was never an active proponent.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Willson {{returned}} to his legal practice in Louisville. From 1910 to 1919, he served on the Harvard University Board of Overseers. In 1914, he was {{a candidate for the}} Senate seat of Johnson Camden. It was the state's first senatorial election since passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, meaning the seat would <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> popular vote rather than by a vote of the legislature. The seat had originally belonged to former governor Bradley, who had died in office. Governor McCreary appointed Camden to fill the unexpired term, but Camden had agreed not to seek re-election so that J. C. W. Beckham could run for the seat. In the Republican primary, Willson defeated Richard P. Ernst. In the general election, the unpopularity of Willson's gubernatorial administration combined with the overwhelming popularity of Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, ensured that Beckham won the seat by more than 32,000 votes. This campaign was Willson's last. He died on August 24, 1931, and is buried in the Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, she ran {{again for}} city council, and was successful. The {{election}} {{was the first}} held under the city's new charter, which had {{been approved by the}} voters that April, designed to shift power away from city council to a strong mayor, something reformers believed would produce a system that would be more efficient and less susceptible to corruption. It also included provisions for civil service reform, requiring that city jobs <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> merit selection rather than patronage. In the November elections, Democrats won control of city government from Republicans {{for the first time in}} 67 years. After narrowly winning a primary race against labor lawyer Harry Galfand, Dallas was elected as a part of that wave, winning 54% of the vote in the new 8th district (covering Chestnut Hill, Germantown, and Roxborough) over incumbent Republican councilman Robert S. Hamilton (the new charter did away with multi-member council districts).|$|E
