We would {{like to comment on}} the inherent bias in the opinion of our own work that is common to all scientists. Most of us feel that our interpretation of research is correct and others interpretation is incorrect. That is why we have a peer-review process for publishing research studies, so that we must endure the criticisms of other scientists in our area to determine whether our work is legitimate. Review papers, as the authors suggest themselves, are secondary sources and thus may be more afflicted by <b>bias</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> than a single research study. So we find it interesting that the authors themselves have decided to write another review paper. A more appropriate review process for assessing research from past investigations in this area is through a statistical meta-analysis. So we have highlighted the findings of some meta-analyses performed recently in the area of resistance training. The following meta-analyses have been performed concerning the issue of dose response for strength development (2, 3) and single versus multiple sets (4, 5). By providing effect size (ES) and using meta-analytic techniques, these studies have provided evidence that supports the theory of progression in resistance training program design.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} contributes four essays to {{the broad}} literature on microeconometric modelling of latent variables and the computational problems that arise {{in the implementation of}} such models. The first chapter revisits a classical discrete choice model, the nested logit model. The implementation of this model in standard software packages caused severe confusion. In empirical applications, researchers commonly used a different model than they thought they would. The chapter discusses the differences between these two specifications and provides examples for the <b>bias</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> and inference if they are ignored. It furthermore describes an implementation of the original model in Stata. The second chapter discusses different modelling strategies for panel data. The models are formulated in a state space framework, allowing a parsimonious and intuitive, yet flexible specification of the intertemporal correlation pattern. In addition, features of typical panel data like panel attrition can easily be accounted for. The application to data on the health evolution of elderly Americans demonstrates the modelling issues and shows the advantage of such approaches over classical models of state dependence or unobserved heterogeneity. The last two chapters discuss numerical problems that arise when estimating such and other models. The main computational problem in these cases lies in the evaluation of expected values or integrals. The third chapter of this dissertation discusses a broad class of nonlinear panel data models. It is discussed how the potentially high-dimensional integral can in these cases be replaced by sequential lower-dimensional integration. The fourth chapter discusses the general case in which such a decomposition is impossible. It proposes to use a certain multivariate generalization of univariate Gaussian quadrature rules in these cases. Both methods in the last two chapters are shown to be computationally efficient compared to the commonly used methods, saving up to 99 % of computational costs...|$|E

The present study considers specifically configurations of ambiguity with multiple compatible antecedents for a pronoun in a discourse, which are not focused on in other studies, and show how the ways this ambiguity is typically resolved reveal <b>biases</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> for pronouns that relate to syntactic position.

Hence, while we acknowledge the important insights of Chen (1986), Pu (2011), and others concerning the potential role that discourse structure and semantics may have in shaping the use and <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> pronouns, we argue, along with Yang et al.

The research considers the nature and distribution of lower-order settlements in the pre-Roman and Roman periods, human impact on the local landscape and the changes which occurred {{as a result of the}} Roman occupation. Also, it addresses previous <b>biases</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> through re-evaluation <b>of</b> earlier data and consideration of new datasets provided by the <b>interpretation</b> and mapping <b>of</b> recent oblique aerial photographs. New detailed plans of the sites discovered through aerial photography have been integrated within a significant amount of scattered published data (excavation and field walking reports; gazetteers) and relevant information from historical maps.

The results provide a complex reconsideration on a more realistic and up-to-date basis of previous theories regarding the native settlement pattern and the impact of Roman colonisation in the chronological and geographical context specified. Also, through the resulting database and GIS, it provides a methodological framework and a customised tool for further analysis of the landscape and of the evolution of the settlement pattern which can be extended throughout the province of Dacia and into the neighbouring areas.

40|$|ABSTRACTAnxiety {{disorders}} are globally prevalent, debilitating and onset in early life. Cognitive <b>bias</b> modification <b>of</b> <b>interpretations</b> (CBM-I) training {{has emerged as}} a targeted intervention for early emerging anxiety problems. While CBM-I can alter interpretational styles in unselected and clinical-analogue samples of adolescents, no studies have assessed its capacity to change biases in clinical samples. Here, we assessed training efficacy in ameliorating interpretation biases and anxious mood in adolescents with anxiety disorders. Twenty-eight Chinese adolescents meeting criteria for a current anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to receive positive or neutral CBM-I training. Training involved completing a word-fragment to resolve the outcomes of sixty ambiguous scenarios. During positive training, scenarios ended with benign/positive resolutions, but during neutral training, half of the scenarios were resolved positively and half negatively. Positively trained patients interpreted new ambiguous scenarios less negatively than the neutral training group although training effects were not observed on a questionnaire measure <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>bias.</b> Training effects on mood were also absent. Before the clinical implications of CBM-I can be considered in adolescents, research needs to establish optimal training parameters for symptom-changes to occur...|$|R

2500|$|While {{video games}} and {{advertising}} were initially gender-neutral, advertising began to narrow its focus to young boys as a target market following the video game crash of 1983. Although commercial hits such as Myst and The Sims appealed to women, these were nonetheless seen by some as being outside the gaming mainstream. Critic Ian Bogost opined, [...] "We're looking at where there isn't diversity and we're saying those games are the most valid games." [...] Industry studies {{on the lack of}} females in gaming have also suffered at times from <b>biases</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Kevin Kelly <b>of</b> Joystiq has suggested that a high degree of circular reasoning is evident when male developers use focus groups and research numbers to determine what kinds of games girls play. After making a bad game that targets those areas suggested by the marketing research, the game's lack of popularity among both genders is often attributed to the incorrect prejudice that [...] "girls don't play games" [...] rather than the true underlying problems such as poor quality and playability of the game. Whereas market data and research are important to reveal that markets exist, argues Kelly, they shouldn't be the guiding factor in how to make a game that appeals to girls. The argument has also been advanced that emphasis on market research is often skewed by the participants in the study. In studies on male gamers of the baby boomer generation, for example, players displayed a marked aversion to violence. The incorrect conclusion that could be drawn from this result—that men dislike violent games—may also be comparable to incorrect conclusions drawn from some female-oriented gaming studies. It has been suggested that developers can learn what girls want in a game by observing similarities in how different girl teams will react to and modify a game if given the opportunity.|$|R
