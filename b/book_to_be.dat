5|$|Cape {{announced}} that he had stopped publication, but he secretly leased the rights to Pegasus Press, an English-language publisher in France. His partner Wren Howard took papier-mâché moulds of the type to Paris, and by 28 September, Pegasus Press was shipping its edition to the London bookseller Leopold Hill, who acted as distributor. With publicity increasing demand, sales were brisk, but the reappearance of The Well on bookshop shelves soon {{came to the attention of}} the Home Office. On 3 October Joynson-Hicks issued a warrant for shipments of the <b>book</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seized.|$|E
5|$|Conflicto y armonías de las razas en América 1883, {{deals with}} race issues in Latin America {{in the late}} 1800s. While {{situations}} in the book remain particular to the time period and location, race issues and conflicts of races are still prevalent and enable the <b>book</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> relevant in the present day.|$|E

5|$|In January 2016, Emma Watson {{started a}} feminist Goodreads book club: Our Shared Shelf. The {{goal of the}} club is to share feminist ideas and {{encourage}} discussion on the topic. One book is selected per month and is discussed {{in the last week}} of that month. The first <b>book</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> selected was My Life on the Road by Gloria Steinem, whom Emma Watson would later interview on 24 February at the How to: Academy in London.|$|E
5|$|The novel explores {{themes of}} history, religion, and social movements. The {{historical}} narrative is guided more by social history than political or military history. Critics found the <b>book</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rich in detail, realistic, and thoughtful. The Years of Rice and Salt won the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2003. In {{the same year}} it was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award, a Hugo Award, and a British Science Fiction Award.|$|E

5|$|When O'Brien {{finally decided}} to write a {{biography}} on Madonna in 2005, she wanted the <b>book</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more about the singer's contribution to her music, rather than delving too much into her personal life, unlike other Madonna biographers. The author then interviewed dancers, choreographers, musicians, and producers who worked with Madonna. After its release, the book received a mixed response from critics. They were unanimous that the over-emphasis given on the singer's discography was unnecessary, instead more thought should have been given on exploring her personal life, which {{would have made the}} biography compelling.|$|E
5|$|Acton was {{supplanted by}} the most famous English cookery book of the Victorian era, Isabella Beeton's Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, 1861, which sold nearly two million copies up to 1868. Where Acton's was a <b>book</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> read and enjoyed, Beeton's, {{substantially}} written in later editions by other hands, was a manual of instructions and recipes, to be looked up as needed. Mrs Beeton was substantially plagiarized from authors including Elizabeth Raffald and Acton. The Anglo-Italian cook Charles Elmé Francatelli became a celebrity, cooking {{for a series of}} aristocrats, London clubs, and royalty including Queen Victoria. His 1846 book The Modern Cook ran through 29 editions by 1896, popularising an elaborate cuisine described throughout with French terminology, and offering bills of fare for up to 300 people.|$|E
5|$|After the war, H.D. and Bryher {{no longer}} lived together, but {{remained}} in contact. H.D. moved to Switzerland where, {{in the spring}} of 1946, she suffered a severe mental breakdown, which resulted in her staying in a clinic until the autumn of that year. Apart from a number of trips to the States, H.D. spent {{the rest of her life}} in Switzerland. In the late 1950s, she underwent more treatment, this time with the psychoanalyst Erich Heydt. At Heydt's prompting, she wrote End to Torment, a memoir of her relationship with Pound, who allowed the poems of Hilda's <b>Book</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> included when the book was published. Doolittle was one of the leading figures in the bohemian culture of London in the early decades of the century. Her later poetry explores traditional epic themes, such as violence and war, from a feminist perspective. H.D. was the first woman to be granted the American Academy of Arts and Letters medal.|$|E

5|$|During {{the time}} the book was written, Paraguay was under the {{dictatorship}} of Alfredo Stroessner, {{who went on to}} rule the country even longer than Francia did. Many consider the <b>book</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at least in part a thinly disguised attack on Stroessner who used methods similar to Francia’s to achieve and maintain the effective control of the country, including the swift elimination of opposition, the employment of torture and intolerance of dissent. In its portrayal of Francia and criticism of Stroessner, I, the Supreme belongs to the genre of novelas de dictadores or dictator novels, and also to the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The book was first published in Spanish in 1974, and in English (translation by Helen Lane) in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Fraser {{was working}} as a {{journalist}} on The Glasgow Herald when he wrote the first novel, Flashman; writing in the evenings, after work, he took 90hours in total to write the story. After the book was published, he left journalism and took up writing novels. When a break from writing was forced upon him by a broken arm, he abandoned the book until his wife read the manuscript and urged him to finish. He did not find a publisher for the novel for two years, until Barrie & Jenkins published it in 1969. When the novel was published in the US the same year, of the 34 reviews read by Alden Whitman of The New York Times, ten of them considered the <b>book</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a genuine autobiography. Fraser researched each novel at Trinity College, Dublin. From their first publication, the books were a commercial success, and new editions appeared on the best-sellers' lists.|$|E
5|$|Marquis {{developed}} his own theories regarding {{the history of}} the Cheyenne. One idea in particular, that many of Custer's men committed suicide when the situation became hopeless, proved to be highly controversial. This idea first surfaced in the Wooden Leg narrative, but was most fully developed in Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself, considered by Marquis to be his most important work and the culmination of his Custer research. The latter was not published during Marquis' life; much of his work did not appear in print until the 1970s. The last <b>book</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> published, The Cheyennes of Montana (pub. 1978), is regarded as especially valuable by historians. In 2006 of a collection of his photographs was published as, A Northern Cheyenne Album.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> the <b>books</b> that {{he calls}} either canonical or <b>books</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> read, he speaks also of <b>books</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rejected, calling them apocrypha, and describing them as [...] "an invention of heretics, who write {{them when they}} choose, bestowing upon them their approbation, and assigning to them a date, that so, using them as ancient writings, they may find occasion to lead astray the simple".|$|R

5|$|Mrs. Tiggy-winkle {{became a}} popular {{character}} {{and the subject of}} considerable merchandise over the decades including nursery ware and porcelain figurines. The tale has been published in braille and the Initial Teaching Alphabet, and has been translated into French, German, and Dutch. In 1971, Mrs. Tiggy-winkle became a character performed by Sir Frederick Ashton in the Royal Ballet film, The Tales of Beatrix Potter. In 1993, the tale was adapted to animation and telecast as an episode of the BBC series, The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends.In the world of Peter rabbit and friends the story was combined with the tale of Jeremy Fisher, the 7th book in the series. This book, the tale of Mrs tiggy Winkle, is the 6th book in the series. It is also the 6th <b>book</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> published.|$|E
5|$|Since Juster did {{the cooking}} for the housemates, if Feiffer wanted to eat, {{he had to}} do the drawings. Feiffer quickly {{realized}} the book would require illustrations of the type and quality that John Tenniel had created for Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and although a nationally-known artist, doubted his competence to do the text justice. Feiffer considers the double-spread illustration of demons late in the <b>book</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a success and one of his favorites. It differs from his usual style (which would involve a white background), and instead uses Gustave Doré's drawings as an inspiration.|$|E
5|$|The {{reported}} overall {{sales figures}} of the A Song of Ice and Fire series vary. The New Yorker said in April 2011 (before the publication of A Dance with Dragons) that more than 15million Ice and Fire books had been sold worldwide, a figure repeated by The Globe and Mail in July 2011. Reuters reported in September 2013 that the books including print, digital and audio versions have sold more than 24million copies in North America. The Wall Street Journal reported more than six million sold copies in North America by May 2011. USA Today reported 8.5million copies in print and digital overall in July 2011, and over 12million sold copies in print in December 2011. The series has been translated into more than 20 languages; USA Today reported the fifth <b>book</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> translated into over 40 languages.

5|$|The {{unexpected}} {{success of}} her first book, No Logo (1999), extended author and journalist Naomi Klein's book tour beyond its original two-week schedule. She spent the next 30 months traveling the world promoting the book as well as writing newspaper articles covering the anti-globalization movement. Most of her articles were originally published in the Canadian national newspaper The Globe and Mail, while some were published by The Nation, The New York Times, and The Guardian. During this time she resisted her publisher's urgings to write a new book, and the pressure to match No Logos success was bearing down upon her. She relented to the pressure for another publication by collecting {{the best of the}} articles and speeches she had written since No Logo. She did not intend this new <b>book</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a sequel or follow-up, but rather a stand alone collection of writing.|$|E
5|$|Wace is Jersey's {{earliest}} known author. Printing {{arrived in}} Jersey {{only in the}} 1780s, but the island supported a multitude of regular publications in French (and Jèrriais) and English throughout the 19th century, in which poetry, most usually topical and satirical, flourished (see Jèrriais literature).The first Jèrriais <b>book</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> published was Rimes et Poésies Jersiaises de divers auteurs réunies et mises en ordre, edited by Abraham Mourant in 1865. Writers born in Jersey include Elinor Glyn, John Lemprière, Philippe Le Sueur Mourant, Robert Pipon Marett and Augustus Asplet Le Gros. Frederick Tennyson and Gerald Durrell were among authors who made Jersey their home. Contemporary authors based in Jersey include Jack Higgins.|$|E
5|$|In 1777, Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc {{introduced}} the Supremum Justitiæ Magistratum (Collegiate Tribunal of the Jury's Supreme Magistrate) {{in order to}} establish more separation of powers in judicial decisions. Giandonato Rogadeo, an eminent European jurist, was requested to come to Malta in 1781 by de Rohan to address issues related to common law. Rogadeo went on to author the Diritto Municipale, between the year of his arrival and 1784, a law <b>book</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used for the Castellania. During his stay in Malta, he further observed that it was not the law which was just problematic but also the judges and advocates which were corrupt. His work was opposed by the advocates and judges, with Baron Gaetano Pisani and Judge Gio Nicoló Muscat anonymously publishing works in Rome in 1783 to challenge it and aiming to keep the status quo which had limited considerations. It became the primarily Maltese law of the Code de Rohan, a humane set of laws, which brought significant reformation to criminal law. The Code incorporated previous laws introduced from former Grand Masters with a more liberal approach. It also set standard regulations for advocates, with some flexibility. It was subsequently amended with the use of bandi. The Diritto Municipale was abolished in 1854, during the British period, and replaced by a more lenient Criminal Code.|$|E
