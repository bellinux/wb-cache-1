5000|$|The Koserow shoal lies {{offshore}} at a {{depth of}} at least 1.75 fathoms. It is about 1 mile N.N.E. of Streckelsberg. Depths of 3.5 to 4.75 fathoms separate the Koserow and Vineta shoals. It is demarcated by a white beacon <b>buoy</b> <b>marked</b> [...] "Koserowbank O." [...] off the shoal's eastern side. Another offshore feature is Koserow Steingrund, a large rock, measuring 1800 ft in length and 600 ft in width. It is aligned in an east-west direction and is demarcated by a white spar <b>buoy,</b> <b>marked</b> [...] "Koserow Steingrund N.".|$|R

50|$|Safe {{channels}} are marked {{in the main}} lakes by the U.S. Coast Guard. When upbound in the lakes, there are green numbered <b>buoys</b> that <b>mark</b> the 'left' or port side of the channel. Red number <b>buoys</b> <b>mark</b> the 'right' or starboard side. It is the opposite when downbound. For Rainy Lake and Namakan Lake, upbound is going east. For Kabetogama Lake, upbound is going west. If you're on Sand Point Lake or Crane Lake, upbound is going south.|$|R
50|$|A <b>buoy</b> <b>marks</b> Eugenie Rock (named {{after the}} vessel that {{grounded}} there in May 1859) {{and the nearby}} Sgeir Graidach. Previously, these hazards were marked by a red-painted beacon on Sgeir Graidach, the foundations of which can still be seen at low tide.|$|R
50|$|Charles Reef {{is a small}} rocky shoal {{about half}} a mile (0.8 kilometers) south and west of Madison Reef, off the coast of Madison in New Haven County, Connecticut. It is between 7 and 18 feet deep and {{surrounded}} by deeper waters. A <b>buoy</b> <b>marks</b> the location.|$|R
50|$|The wreck {{presented}} {{something of}} a hazard to a navigation {{and as a result}} it was blown up on 30 August 1838 in a clearance attempt. Today the Boyne <b>buoy</b> <b>marks</b> the site of the explosion. A few metal artifacts from the ship remain atop a mound of shingle.|$|R
50|$|Although ships {{delivered}} freight {{and passengers}} to Cairns from October 1876 {{and the town}} was surveyed the same year, the harbour was not surveyed for shipping until 1878. Until then, buoys were used to guide ships from the Fairway <b>buoy</b> (<b>marking</b> the channel entrance) through the channel towards Trinity Inlet, with a lantern on shore serving as a leading light at night.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>buoy</b> <b>marks</b> {{the dive}} {{site for the}} people on the surface, who are {{generally}} on the dive boat, who provide safety cover for the divers. This helps them focus on the place where the divers are likely to return to the surface and helps them return to the dive site more quickly after the boat has moved away from the site.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 500 (of which 140 are lighted) River <b>Marks</b> and <b>Buoys</b> are {{maintained}} by the KoPT. These are extremely useful in facilitating night navigation, pilotage and dredging. These lights are operated either by grid electricity, by battery or by dissolved Marine Acetylene Gas. There is also 1 boat buoy, 30 lighted buoys and 72 unlit <b>buoys</b> <b>marking</b> the navigational channel from Sandheads to Kolkata.|$|R
5000|$|Theos Wreck is 229 ft {{long and}} 10.670 ft and rests on her port side at depth of 103 ft at MLT, and about 50 ft {{feet from the}} islands {{continental}} shelf. It is approximately two miles offshore of Xanadu Beach Resort & Marina. Two <b>buoys</b> <b>mark</b> the location of [...] "Theos Wreck". Since 1982, the ship has become home to much marine life.|$|R

50|$|By {{this time}} a new North Channel was being dredged, and {{it came to be}} the {{preferred}} route. Therefore when Fort Standish was being rebuilt in 1939, the Lovells Island lights were removed, leaving the Broad Sound Channel lights as the only markers for any part of the old route other than <b>buoys</b> <b>marking</b> specific shoals. The lights were finally discontinued and removed around 1950. Fill from the Big Dig has been used to expand and raise the island, eliminating every trace of the old lights.|$|R
60|$|Few men, {{and never}} a woman, {{could do a}} fine thing so delicately as he; {{but of course it}} {{included}} a divergence from the truth, for to Tommy afloat on a generous scheme the truth was a <b>buoy</b> <b>marking</b> sunken rocks. She had feared him in her childhood, as he knew well; he therefore proceeded to prove to her that she had never feared him. She had thought him masterful, and all his reminiscences now went to show that it was she who had been the masterful one.|$|R
50|$|Ensenada Honda ebbs about 2 miles northwestward, {{between the}} capes of Cabra de Tierra and Punta Cascajo. Cabra de Tierra is the {{southern}} tip of the headland that separates Bahía de Puerca and Ensenada Honda. Cabra de Tierra is 35 feet high and rocky with a few scrub trees. <b>Buoys</b> <b>mark</b> a dredged channel that leads northwestward into the harbor from a position of about 1/2/mile southward of Cabra de Tierra. A shore bank with a depth of fewer than 3 fathoms stretches for about 1 mile southeastward from Punta Cascajo.|$|R
50|$|Yacht {{clubs are}} mostly located by the sea, {{although}} there are some that have been established at a lake or riverside locations. Yacht or sailing clubs have either a marina or a delimited section of the beach or shoreline with <b>buoys</b> <b>marking</b> the areas off-limits for swimmers as well as safe offshore anchorages. On shore they also include a perimeter reserved for the exclusive use {{of the members of the}} club as well as a clubhouse with attached bar, café or restaurant where members socialize in a pleasant and informal setting.|$|R
5000|$|A delayed surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB), {{decompression}} buoy or deco buoy {{is similar to}} a surface marker buoy but is deployed whilst the diver is submerged and generally only {{towards the end of the}} dive. The <b>buoy</b> <b>marks</b> the diver's position underwater so the boat safety cover can locate the diver even though the diver may have drifted some distance from the dive site while doing decompression stops. A reel and line connect the buoy on the surface to the diver beneath the surface. Alternative means of marking one's position while doing decompression stops are diving shots and decompression trapezes.|$|R
5000|$|A {{temporary}} marker <b>buoy</b> set to <b>mark</b> a man overboard position.|$|R
50|$|There are other, smaller red <b>buoys</b> which <b>mark</b> the {{boundaries}} of each course. Going outside of these buoys is not recommended, as staying outside of them for too long results in a disqualification.|$|R
500|$|On 14 January, Captain Brown and his {{operations}} and navigating officers met {{to discuss the}} upcoming cruise to Cuba and the details surrounding this cruise, and also talk briefly about the acoustical test they were to run. The ship was to pass between two orange-and-white-striped <b>buoys</b> that <b>marked</b> the entrance and exit from the range. The range itself was located precariously close to the [...] "danger bearing" [...] — the shoal {{area in which the}} safe [...] of water that could accommodate a ship shoaled to only [...] To make matters worse, the range through which Missouri was to pass had originally been <b>marked</b> with five <b>buoys,</b> but this number had been reduced to two buoys two days prior to the arrival of Captain Brown. Morris was aware that three of the five buoys had been removed from the range, but had not received authorization to delete the non-existent buoys from the chart. Although informed of this during the conference, Captain Brown and Commander Millett left the conference under the mistaken belief that there were still five <b>buoys</b> <b>marking</b> the acoustical range.|$|R

5000|$|On 10 August, the squadron, under Samuel Pym, landed {{parties to}} capture the Île de la Passe and take control of Port-Impérial, {{initiating}} the Battle of Grand Port. From 23 August, the British squadron faced off against a French squadron under Guy-Victor Duperré, comprising Minerve, Bellone and Victor. The French had moved the <b>buoys</b> <b>marking</b> the passage through the reef, causing Magicienne and Sirius to run aground and leading the British to scuttle them by fire. Néréide was captured. Iphigenia, which had been kept in reserve, attempted to flee, but French reinforcements under Hamelin - (Vénus, Manche and Créole) - intercepted her, forcing Iphigenia to strike her colours.|$|R

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of World War I, B3, B4, and B5 were at Dover and were deployed on a line between Calais and the Goodwin Sands to protect {{the passage of the}} British Expeditionary Force to France. Each submarine would sail from Dover before dawn to be secured at the <b>buoy</b> <b>marking</b> their billet at dawn, the idea being that {{they would be able to}} slip from the buoy when they spotted an enemy ship and manoeuvre to attack. That this was not a good tactic was proved when B3 narrowly avoided a torpedo from a German U-boat on the morning of 2 October. Nonetheless the scheme was successful and the BEF crossed to France without loss.|$|R
