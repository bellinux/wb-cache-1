We analyze the dynamics through the <b>bouncing</b> threshold and spatio-temporal diagrams. We obtain an analytic expression for the threshold.

In particular, key features of the <b>bouncing</b> droplet dynamics are reproduced...|$|R

40|$|In <b>bouncing</b> cosmology, the {{primordial}} fluctuations are generated in a cosmic contraction phase before the <b>bounce</b> {{into the current}} expansion phase. For a nonsingular <b>bounce,</b> curvature and anisotropy grow rapidly during the <b>bouncing</b> phase, raising questions about the reliability of perturbative analysis. In this paper, we study the evolution of adiabatic perturbations in a nonsingular <b>bounce</b> by nonperturbative methods including numerical simulations of the nonsingular <b>bounce</b> and the covariant formalism for calculating nonlinear perturbations. We show that the <b>bounce</b> is disrupted in regions of the universe with significant inhomogeneity and anisotropy over the background energy density, but is achieved in regions that are relatively homogeneous and isotropic. Sufficiently small perturbations, consistent with observational constraints, can pass through the nonsingular <b>bounce</b> with negligible alteration from nonlinearity. We follow scale invariant perturbations generated in a matter-like contraction phase through the <b>bounce.</b> Their amplitude in the expansion phase {{is determined by the}} growing mode in the contraction phase, and the scale invariance is well preserved across the <b>bounce.</b> Comment: 38 pages + appendices, 22 figure...|$|R

5|$|The post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 20-yard line, and the Hokies began an offensive drive hoping to run down the clock and preserve their two-touchdown lead. Because the game clock continues to run on rushing plays, the Hokies executed five consecutive rushing plays, picking up a first down in the process. The Hokies were unable to gain a second first down, however, and Tech punted from its 40-yard line. The kick rolled out of bounds at the Eagles' 28-yard line with 9:28 remaining in the game, and Boston College took over on offense. On the first play after the punt, however, Tech defender Jason Worilds tackled Davis, forcing a fumble, which <b>bounced</b> {{into the hands of}} fellow defender Orion Martin, who ran it 17 yards for a defensive touchdown. The extra point <b>bounced</b> off an upright, however, and was no good. Still, with just 9:05 remaining in the game, Tech took a commanding 30–10 lead.|$|E

50|$|Historically, the <b>bouncing</b> ball {{has been}} a popular theme in {{computer}} demo effects since the 1950s, when a <b>bouncing</b> ball demo was released for Whirlwind computers. It later became the primary theme for the early Atari games Pong and Breakout. Commodore released a <b>bouncing</b> ball demo at the 1978 Consumer Electronics Show, to illustrate {{the capabilities of the}} VIC chip. A similar theme was used by Amiga Corporation to demonstrate the capabilities of the Amiga computer at the 1984 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1984. It was a real-time animation showing a red-and-white spinning ball <b>bouncing</b> and casting a shadow, this <b>bouncing</b> ball became the official logo of the Amiga company. Within the context of this tradition of <b>bouncing</b> ball demos at the Consumer Electronics Show, CBS Electronics also showed a <b>Bouncing</b> Ball demo for the Atari VCS/2600, with a spinning and <b>bouncing</b> ball, at the same event. Following these semi-official demonstrations, the <b>bouncing</b> ball theme has reappeared in various demoscene productions.|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook took a single from Lindwall, who {{promptly}} removed Emmett for a duck. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the line of off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who dived and took it in his right hand. This brought Lindwall’s tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bounce Edrich, fearing this would be interpreted as retaliation and generate negative media attention. However, Miller retaliated with four consecutive bouncers, angering the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman and ordered him to stop; the Australian captain apologised to Edrich for the hostile bowling. Lindwall <b>bounced</b> Washbrook and was no balled by umpire Dai Davies for dragging his foot beyond the line. After a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the tension faded away and the paceman was not no balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman. Lindwall <b>bounced</b> Washbrook again {{and this time the}} England opener went for the hook shot. The ball flew off the top edge in the air, straight towards Hassett at fine leg, who dropped the catch after juggling three times. Having received a reprieve on 21, Washbrook settled down and reached 50 in only 70 minutes with England at 1/80.|$|E

As a testament to his controversial style of play, Bowen picked up a $10,000 NBA fine for kicking Ray Allen in the back during a March 2006 game.|$|E

40|$|Two discs {{moving from}} {{opposite}} points in space, overlapping and {{stopping at the}} other disc’s starting point, {{can be seen as}} either <b>bouncing</b> or streaming through each other. With silent displays, observers report the discs as streaming, whereas if a sound is played when the discs touch each other, observers report the discs as <b>bouncing.</b> The origin of the switch from streaming to <b>bouncing</b> response is not known yet. The sound either shifts perception toward that of an impact-elastic event (i. e., a <b>bounce)</b> or subtracts the attention that is necessary to perceive the discs as streaming. We used either impact-similar (abrupt amplitude attack, gradual decay) or impact-dissimilar sounds (gradual amplitude attack, abrupt decay) and found that the first sounds induce the <b>bouncing</b> response, whereas the latter, although as distracting as the first, render streaming and <b>bouncing</b> responses equally frequent at most. We interpret the audiovisual <b>bouncing</b> effect as resulting from attention subtraction, which raises the number of <b>bounce</b> responses in comparison with silent displays, and from perception, which further increments the number of <b>bounce</b> responses and turns the response into a strong <b>bounce</b> response...|$|R

50|$|Interpretation of the <b>bounce</b> rate measure {{should be}} {{relevant}} to a website's business objectives and definitions of conversion, as having a high <b>bounce</b> rate {{is not always a}} sign of poor performance. On sites where an objective can be met without viewing more than one page, for example on websites sharing specific knowledge on some subject (dictionary entry, specific recipe), the <b>bounce</b> rate would not be as meaningful for determining conversion success. In contrast, the <b>bounce</b> rate of an e-commerce site could be interpreted in correlation with the purchase conversion rate, providing the <b>bounces</b> are considered representative of visits where no purchase was made.
