Bloodless surgery has been successfully performed in such invasive operations as open-heart surgery and total hip replacements.

50|$|We {{have looked}} at blood flow and blood composition. Before {{we look at the}} main issue, hemodilution, let us take a brief history into the use of blood. Its {{therapeutic}} use is not a modern phenomenon. Egyptian writings dates back at least 2000 years suggest oral ingestion of blood as a ‘sovereign remedy’ for leprosy. Experiments with the first intravenous blood transfusions began {{at the start of the}} 16th century, and in the last 50 years the field of transfusion medicine has progressed remarkably, bringing with it an increase in the use of blood and blood products. However, the therapeutic use of blood comes with significant risks. As a result, many persons are searching for alternatives to the transfusion of whole blood. Today, <b>bloodless</b> <b>medicine</b> and surgery (BMS) programs have been developed not only for people with certain religious beliefs, but also for patients who fear the risks of blood transfusions and desire to take the best possible medical precautions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bloodless</b> <b>medicine</b> {{appeals to}} many doctors because it carries low risk of {{post-operative}} infection {{when compared with}} procedures requiring blood transfusion. Additionally, it may be economically beneficial in some countries. For example, the cost {{of blood in the}} US hovers around $500 a unit, including testing. These costs are further increased as, according to Jan Hoffman (an administrator for the blood conservation program at Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, Pennsylvania), hospitals must pick up the tab for the first three units of blood infused per patient per calendar year. By contrast, hospitals may be reimbursed for drugs that boost a patient's red blood cell count, a treatment approach often used before and after surgery to reduce the need for a blood transfusion. However, such payments are highly contingent upon negotiations with insurance companies. Geisinger Medical Center began a blood conservation program in 2005 and reported a recorded savings of $273,000 in its first six months of operation. The Cleveland Clinic lowered their direct costs from US$35.5 million in 2009 to $26.4 million in 2012—a savings of nearly $10 million over 3 years.|$|E

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} use of blood {{carries with it}} uncommon but potentially fatal complications. These well-documented risks have motivated a reevaluation of current transfusion prac-tice. Recent information suggests that severe anemia may be safely managed without allogeneic blood products in a significant subset of patients. <b>Bloodless</b> <b>medicine</b> and surgery (BMS) programs have been developed mainly {{to meet the needs}} of Jehovah’s Witness patients, but they also apply to non-Witness patients who desire to avoid or minimize their exposure to allogeneic blood products.

40|$|The {{respect for}} {{self-determination}} has represented {{a great challenge}} for the medical community. This debate has resulted in laws, codes of ethics, international treaties, and administrative guidelines, all {{with the purpose of}} protecting such right. In the medical field, the "Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with Regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine: Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine", known as the Oviedo Convention plays a crucial role. The doctrine of Informed Consent (IC) exists to enforce it. This principle is considered as ¡aw in some countries. In Chile, the IC is considered in the legal ordinance and in documents that are used as guidelines in the field of ethics. Jehovah s Witnesses invoke such precepts when they demand respect for their decisions. The present article outlines their position regarding blood transfusions and their contribution to the practice of <b>bloodless</b> <b>medicine</b> and surgery, which promotes the respect for patient's self determination. The experience of Jehovah's Witnesses has lead to a dignified treatment of the patient and has promoted a better participation in decision-making, focusing on the patient. All these benefits can be conveyed to other patients, resulting in the protection of the dignity of the individual...|$|E

Unfortunately, despite the fact that transfusions are associated with a number of infectious and noninfectious risks, and in spite of the fact that there are ethical, accreditation, and regulatory requirements to provide information regarding transfusion risks, benefits, and alternatives to patients, transfusion consent remains inconsistently obtained. This can partly be attributed to the fact that clinicians may take on a paternalistic approach to transfusion decisions as well as to the fact that many clinicians have knowledge gaps in transfusion medicine that prevent them from obtaining transfusion consent adequately. As a result, unlike the case with other medical and surgical therapies, most patients are not included in the making of informed decisions regarding the need for transfusion versus alternative therapies, leading to many situations in which the transfusions provide little benefit to them. Recently however, a number of organizations, such as the American Association of Blood Banks and The Joint Commission in the US, have promoted multidisciplinary, evidence-based treatment strategies that aim to minimize the need for blood transfusion, the so-called patient blood management (PBM) protocols. PBM strategies are expected to improve blood utilization through optimization of patients who may need blood transfusions via measures such as preoperative anemia management, intraoperative cell salvage, and improved transfusion guidelines. PBM strategies also focus on enhanced requirements for transfusion education and shared decision making, including informed consent and, thus, promote a patient-centered approach as defined by the Institute of Medicine.

40|$|Medicine has {{historically}} regarded blood transfusion {{as an integral}} component of major surgery or illness. However, clinical {{studies have shown that}} allogeneic blood transfusions are associated with increased morbidity and decreased survival. Knowledge of this research and the concepts of blood conservation so as to avoid unnecessary blood transfusions is needed in order to deliver holistic care and serve as patient advocate. This knowledge reaches every specialty of nursing care. This study of the nurse 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge of blood conservation as a part of blood management utilizes The Conservation Model developed by Myra E. Levine in 1973. Levine 2 ̆ 7 s work is a conceptual model of nursing that focuses on conservation of the person 2 ̆ 7 s wholeness (Tomey 2 ̆ 6 Alligood, 2002). It is defined as 2 ̆ 2 keeping together 2 ̆ 2 of the life systems and the integrity of the individual (Schaefer, 2006, p. 98). The Theory of Conservation {{is based on the assumption}} that all nursing actions are conservation principles (Schaefer, 2006). Conservation is further defined in the model as achieving a balance of energy supply and demand that is within the unique biological realities of the individual (Tomey 2 ̆ 6 Alligood, 2002). The model proposes that the nurse participates actively in the patient 2 ̆ 7 s environment, and much of what the nurse does supports the patient 2 ̆ 7 s adaptations as he struggles in the predicament of illness. Maintaining or conserving a patient 2 ̆ 7 s viable resources such as skin integrity, immunity, oxygen demand and blood supply are essential in providing an environment in which the patient can heal. Because knowledge of blood conservation as part of blood management is vital to providing appropriate care and avoidance of unnecessary blood transfusion, this research examines what knowledge practicing nurses in varying areas of expertise possess regarding blood conservation. This study of the nurse 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge of blood conservation as a part of blood management was conducted using a convenience sample of registered nurses employed at a rural acute care hospital with no formal blood conservation program or <b>bloodless</b> <b>medicine</b> and surgery services. The study sample represented various areas of practice and all educational levels. A survey consisting of basic questions regarding blood conservation strategies and concepts was administered to practicing registered nurses. The survey was developed using current literature focusing on blood conservation techniques. The survey found that a minority of nurses gained education regarding blood conservation in their nursing programs. It also revealed a lack of knowledge related to appropriate indicator for blood transfusion and demonstrated that nurses discard an unnecessary amount of blood when drawing blood samples from central lines. The limitations of this study included small sample size and researcher developed questionnaire...|$|E
