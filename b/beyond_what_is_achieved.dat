40|$|Abstract. There are {{two main}} {{shortcomings}} in the existing models for generating checking sequences based on distinguishing sequences.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article {{is to examine the}} {{relationship}} between a so-called "garden leave" clause and a post-termination restraint of trade clause in employment contracts, in view of the decision in Vodacom (Pty) Ltd v Motsa 2016 3 SA 116 (LC). The Labour Court grappled with the question of whether the enforcement of the garden leave provision impacts on the enforcement of a post-termination restraint of trade clause. Enforcement of both these types of clauses may be problematic. It can result in unfairness if an employee ends up being commercially inactive for a long period. The author argues that garden leave has a direct effect on the enforcement of a post- termination restraint of trade clause.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to test the {{effectiveness}} of wage-irrelevant goal setting policies in a laboratory environment. In our design, managers can assign a goal to their workers by setting a certain level of performance on the work task. We establish our theoretical conjectures by developing a model where assigned goals act as reference points to workers' intrinsic motivation. Consistent with our model, we find that managers set goals which are challenging but attainable for an average-ability worker. Workers respond to these goals by increasing effort, performance and by decreasing on-the-job leisure activities with respect to the no-goal setting baseline. Finally, we study the interaction between goal setting and monetary rewards and find that goal setting is most effective when monetary incentives are strong. These results suggest that goal setting may produce intrinsic motivation and increase workers' performance <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> using solely monetary incentives...|$|E

METHODS Overweight and obese children (n = 120, age: 12 - 18 y, BMI: 27 - 40 kg/m 2) were randomized to receive a calorie restricted diet providing a 500 kcal/d deficit from total energy expenditure and two (n = 40), three (n = 40) or four (n = 40) servings of dairy products/day. Anthropometric measurements in addition to serum hs-CRP and lipid profile were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. RESULTS Among the 96 children who completed the study, significant reductions in overall BMI, BMI z-score, weight, total body fat percentage and total body fat mass were observed (p 0. 05).

40|$|Competition law in many {{countries}} prohibits firms from making false claims about product quality or performance to potential buyers and also requires that the truth of specific claims be supported by adequate prior testing.

This paper develops a model in which firms have private information about their probability of having a high quality product {{and are able to}} determine product quality with certainty through costly learning. Penalties for false claims and for unsubstantiated claims create an opportunity for firms to credibly reveal their information and for signaling to emerge in equilibrium.

In this paper we investigate AGG behaviors in NbC-added Fe-Ga rolled sheets with varying thicknesses for converting polycrystalline ingots of Fe-Ga alloy into single-crystal-like rolled sheet for application as the transduction components in low-cost magnetostrictive devices. Magnetostriction values of greater than 200 ppm resulted from AGG of a large single Goss grain, (011) [100], in 0. 35 -mm to 0. 60 -mm thick sheet samples annealed at 1200 oC. Samples thinner than 0. 35 mm or thicker than 0. 60 mm developed (113) [uvw]-oriented grain growth or random orientations with low magnetostriction values. In order to understand how thickness influences grain growth behaviors, a total interface energy model has been developed that combines both grain boundary and surface energies. We investigated the hypothesis that surface energy differences between grains in conjunction with grain boundary energy act as the driving force underlying the ability to selectively develop AGG and even to promote single-crystal-like grain growth.

To answer this question, we exploit the variation in state hazardous waste site laws across states and over time.

Results vary with the chemical being analysed. For some chemicals, the presence of strict liability does not provide any additional explanatory power for the number of spills <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by the number of establishments and the sectoral composition of manufacturing. For other families of chemicals, we find that spills are more numerous in states that impose strict liability. Further investigation suggests that (i) for some of these chemicals, this could be due to unobserved state characteristics influencing spills, which may have acted to reduce the incentives of liability, and that (ii) small firms are responsible for a disproportionate number of spills, regardless of the liability structure. An alternative explanation, supported by the results of a separate regression for two liability regimes, is that only under strict liability are small firms responsible for a disproportionate number of spills...|$|E

These two sets of honors students are then compared to a third group of similar students, those who had comparable pre-college academic credentials as the honors students, but who {{did not participate in}} an honors program (called high-ability students; n = 108). These three student groups entered three Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education universities as first-time, full-time freshmen in fall 1997.

40|$|BackgroundExercise Doppler echocardiographic {{stress test}} {{can be of}} {{interest}} in the management of asymptomatic patients with primary MR. The resting BNP level is a good surrogate marker of MR consequences and is a powerful predictor of outcome. The incremental prognostic value of BNP response during exercise is unknown. We aimed to identify the determinants of exercise brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level and to evaluate its prognostic value in asymptomatic patients with primary mitral regurgitation (MR). MethodsComprehensive resting and exercise transthoracic Dopplerechocardiography was performed in 113 consecutive asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe degenerative MR and preserved LV function. Blood samples were collected both at rest and exercise. ResultsThe BNP level significantly increased from rest to exercise (p< 0. 0001). The independent determinants of exercise BNP were resting E/Ea ratio (p= 0. 043), indexed left atrial volume (p= 0. 022) and exercise LV global longitudinal strain (p= 0. 001). There was a significant graded relationship between increasing BNP level at exercise (according to tertiles) and increased incidence of cardiac events (death, heart failure, mitral valve surgery driven by symptoms or LV dilatation/dysfunction onset) (2 -year: 21 ± 7 vs. 40 ± 8 vs. 67 ± 9 %; in tertiles 1, 2 and 3, respectively). On multivariable analysis, after adjustment for demographic and echocardiographic data and for resting BNP level, exercise BNP remained significantly associated with increased risk of cardiac events during the follow-up (hazard ratio= 2. 8 and 3. 4, p= 0. 041 and 0. 023, for tertiles 2 and 3, as compared to tertile 1). ConclusionsIn asymptomatic patients with primary regurgitation, exercise BNP level provides important incremental prognostic value <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by demographic and echocardiographic data and resting BNP level.

40|$|For many-core {{architectures}} {{like the}} GPUs, efficient off-chip memory access {{is crucial to}} high performance; the applications are often limited by off-chip memory bandwidth. Transforming data layout is {{an effective way to}} reshape the access patterns to improve off-chip memory access behavior, but several challenges had limited the use of automated data layout transformation systems on GPUs, namely how to efficiently handle arrays of aggregates, and transparently marshal data between layouts required by different performance sensitive kernels and legacy host code. While GPUs have higher memory bandwidth and are natural candidates for marshaling data between layouts, the relatively constrained GPU memory capacity, compared to that of the CPU, implies that not only the temporal cost of marshaling but also the spatial overhead must be considered for any practical layout transformation systems. This paper presents DL, a practical GPU data layout transformation system that addresses these problems: first, a novel approach to laying out array of aggregate types across GPU and CPU architectures is proposed to further improve memory parallelism and kernel performance <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by human programmers using discrete arrays today.

We present insights that lead to the design of this highly efficient run-time marshaling library. In particular, the in situ transformation implemented in the library is comparable or faster than optimized traditional out-of-place transformations while avoiding doubling the GPU DRAM usage. Third, we show experimental results that the new layout approach leads to substantial performance improvement at the applications level even when all marshaling cost is taken into account...|$|E
40|$|Unobtrusive and {{inexpensive}} technologies for monitoring the cardiovascular health {{of heart failure}} (HF) patients outside the clinic can potentially improve their continuity of care by enabling therapies to be adjusted dynamically based on the changing needs of the patients. Specifically, cardiac contractility and stroke volume (SV) are two key aspects of cardiovascular health that change significantly for HF patients as their condition worsens, yet these parameters are typically measured only in hospital/clinical settings, or with implantable sensors. In this work, we demonstrate accurate measurement of cardiac contractility (based on pre-ejection period, PEP, timings) and SV changes in subjects using ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals detected via a high bandwidth force plate. The measurement is unobtrusive, as it simply requires the subject to stand still on the force plate while holding electrodes in the hands for simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG) detection. Specifically, we aimed to assess whether the high bandwidth force plate can provide accuracy <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> using modified weighing scales we have developed in prior studies, based on timing intervals, as well as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimates.

This correlation is stronger during recovery after exercise due to more significant changes in PEP (r 2 = 0. 92). The improvement in accuracy {{can be attributed to the}} wider bandwidth of the force plate. ∆SV (i. e., changes in stroke volume) estimations from the force plate BCG resulted in an average error percentage of 5. 3 % with a standard deviation of ± 4. 2 % across all subjects.

Considering the current situation at this level of education, however, there still seems to be more to do. And the question is, what more can we do? What further contribution can we make? Or, how can we take this process further? The purpose of the study reported here is to respond to this last question. We test the proposition {{that it is possible to}} take this process further by investigating the efficient management of transition from Turkish-medium to English-medium at the tertiary level of education in Turkey. <b>Beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by only the language orientation of the EAP approach, and moving conceptually deeper than what has been achieved by the team-teaching approach, the research undertaken for the purpose of this study focuses on the idea of the discourse community that people want to belong to.

40|$|Experimental {{efforts to}} {{determine}} how insects influence terrestrial wood decomposition are few, especially in temperate regions. To address this need, a five-year exclusion {{study was conducted in}} northern Mississippi, U. S. A., to quantify insect contributions to wood decay using one-meter loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) bolts. The study included three treatments: (1) ‘‘partially protected’’ bolts that were placed on cypermethrin-treated soil to exclude subterranean termites (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae: Reticulitermes spp.) while permitting colonization by beetles (Coleoptera) and other saproxylic taxa, (2) ‘‘fully protected’’ bolts that were placed on cypermethrin-treated soil and enclosed within screen cages to protect against all insects and (3) ‘‘unprotected’’ bolts that were not subjected to either exclusion treatment. The full insect community consumed approximately 15 – 20 % of wood volume in unprotected bolts, about six times more than in partially protected bolts from which termites were excluded. There were no differences in specific gravity (based on initial wood volume) or mass loss among treatments, however. It is not clear whether these findings are due to an inhibition of microbial decomposers by insects (e. g., antimicrobial compounds secreted by termites or ants), a stimulatory effect of the exclusion treatments (e. g., cypermethrin stimulating fungal growth or cages favorably altering wood moisture), or some combination of both. When based on final water-displaced volume, specific gravity was significantly higher for unprotected bolts than for those fully protected, probably because termites selectively consume the least dense wood. By the end of the study, about 20 % of the final dry weight of unprotected bolts consisted of termite-imported soil. Wood volume consumed and soil content decreased with distance from the ends of the bolts whereas water content exhibited the opposite pattern. We detected a significant negative relationship between water content and volume consumed by termites, possibly because water content decreases with increasing wood density and termites tend to avoid high density wood. While insects clearly consume large volumes of wood in southeastern U. S. forests, our results suggest they do not act to accelerate mass loss <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by microbial decomposers.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} issue of whether strict {{liability}} imposed on polluters has served to reduce uncontrolled releases of toxics into the environment. Strict liability should create additional incentives for firms to handle hazardous substances more carefully, thus reducing the future likelihood of uncontrolled releases of toxics. However, the size of these incentives may vary according {{to the size of a}} firm's assets, since asset size is the ultimate limit on a firm's liability. We are therefore interested to see whether imposing strict liability for the cost of remediation at hazardous waste sites has encouraged firms to handle toxic materials more carefully and has uniformly reduced the incidence of toxic spills, or whether the effect is dependent on firm size and other factors. To answer these questions, we exploit the variation in state hazardous waste site laws across states and over time. We use data on accidents and spills involving hazardous substances coming from a comprehensive database of events reported to the US EPA under their Emergency Response Notification System (ERNS), and fit regressions relating the frequency of spills of selected chemicals used in manufacturing to the type of liability in force in a state. We control for the extent of manufacturing activity in the state, and include in the regression other program features that might alter firms' expected outlays in the event of an accident, and thus affect firms' incentives to take care. Results vary with the chemical being analyzed. For some chemicals, such as halogenated solvents, the presence of strict liability does not provide any additional explanatory power for the number of spills <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by the number of establishments and the sectoral composition of manufacturing. For other families of chemicals (acids, ammonia and chlorine), we find that the impacts of manufacturing activities on the number of spills in each state do vary systematically with the liability regime. In particular, it appears that under strict liability small firms are responsible for a disproportionate number of spills. Since strict liability states tend to have more manufacturing firms, and more small manufacturing firms, these factors serve to increase the number of spills of these chemicals in strict liability states. ...|$|E

Some observers worry that the multilateral system may be fracturing into discriminatory regional blocs.

Jeffrey Frankel shows through extensive empirical analysis that {{the new breed of}} preferential trade arrangements are indeed concentrating trade regionally.

He concludes that a move to complete liberalization within blocs, with no reduction in barriers between blocs, would push the trading system into the supernatural zone of an excessive degree of regionalization. More balanced patterns of liberalization, however, give favorable outcomes. He considers regionalism at two levels: both the formal trading arrangements that are already in effect, and the broader continent-sized groupings that are under discussion (the Americas, Europe, and the Asia Pacific). Frankel's study also assesses the political and economic dimensions of regionalization and its implications for world economic prospects and public policy. In conclusion, Frankel proposes several policy prescriptions for pursuing partial regional liberalization among blocs as a stepping stone toward global free trade. ...|$|R
