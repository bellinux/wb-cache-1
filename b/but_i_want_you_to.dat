25|$|I {{want to ask}} {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of our}} dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know â€“ I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E
2500|$|After {{considering}} his situation, believing {{that not only}} would he never walk again, but that he might never move a body part again, Reeve considered suicide. He mouthed to Dana, [...] "Maybe we should let me go." [...] She tearfully replied, [...] "I am only {{going to say this}} once: I will support whatever you want to do because this is your life, and your decision. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know that I'll be with you for the long haul, no matter what. You're still you. And I love you." [...] Reeve never considered euthanasia as an option again.|$|E
2500|$|When Mandisa {{presented}} {{herself to}} the judges prior to the final cut-down to the season's 24 semi-finalists, she told Cowell: [...] "What I {{want to say to}} you is that, yes, you hurt me and I cried and it was painful, it really was. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know that I've forgiven you and that you don't need someone to apologize in order to forgive somebody. I figure that if Jesus could die so that all of my wrongs could be forgiven, I can certainly extend that same grace to you." [...] Cowell told Mandisa that he was [...] "humbled" [...] and apologized to her immediately.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{know that}} very well; I didn't believe {{a word of}} it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> {{to come into the}} house; I thought we should be friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Pretty well. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> {{was lost}} without my mascot. I've got {{a story in}} this month's Wilson's. A long story, and paid accordingly. That's why I'm able to go about giving suppers to great actresses.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In the 1960s, {{a leading}} {{figure in the}} civil rights {{movement}} was Martin Luther King Jr., who was called [...] "a modern Moses," [...] and often referred to Moses in his speeches: [...] "The struggle of Moses, the struggle of his devoted followers as they sought to get out of Egypt. This is something of the story of every people struggling for freedom." [...] And I've looked over. And I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. | last = King | first = Martin Luther Jr | title = The Papers | publisher = Univ. of California Press | year = 2000 | page = 155}} ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Hart {{states in}} Hitman, that while conversing with Michaels: [...] "I added, 'I also {{want you to}} know that I have no problem {{dropping}} the belt to you if that's what Vince wants.' He glared back at me. 'I appreciate that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know that I'm not willing to do the same for you.' And then he left. Jim [...] snorted, 'I can't believe that he just said that.' There was no way I could ever drop the belt to him now: he'd just shown complete disrespect not only to me, but to the position of champion..." [...] This exchange is confirmed in Dave Meltzer's account: [...] "During the meeting, Hart told Michaels that he'd be happy to put him over at the end of the run, but Michaels told Hart flat-out that he wouldn't return the favor. Michaels and Hart spoke again on the subject on 10/12 in San Jose, when once again Michaels told Hart that he wasn't going to do a job for him." [...] Additionally, in Forgiven Vince Russo stated, [...] "Well - no surprise here - Bret refused to do the job (get pinned) for Shawn in Canada. Not because he was being unprofessional - but because according to Bret, Michaels had said that he wouldn't do business with him (the right thing for the company in the ring), due to the way he felt about him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} hear it, Thomas. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{promise me}} to attend to your studies. Military matters are all well enough in their way, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> have the {{benefits}} of a good education." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> should {{promise me}} this: that you won't let {{anything}} tempt you--anything!--to ever trouble Rogers for that money you lent him. No matter what happens--no {{matter if you}} lose it all. Do you promise?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, well; {{let that}} go! ... Jude, I must say good-bye! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> {{to go to}} the {{cemetery}} with me. Let our farewell be there--beside the graves of those who died to bring home to me the error of my views." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon my {{eccentric}} greeting, {{brother of}} the open road, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to give ear to my obsequious query as to how's chances on gettin' a lift? I have learned that obsequiousness is best appreciated when it is backed up by prayer and ca'tridges." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everybody does," [...] {{said the}} Story Girl coolly. [...] "I'm glad {{you like the}} way I talk. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> like ME, too--AS WELL as you like Felicity and Cecily. Not BETTER. I wanted that once but I've got over it. I found out in Sunday School, the day the {{minister}} taught our class, that it was selfish. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> like me AS WELL." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No. I was disagreeable too, Pa; we {{were all}} of us disagreeable together. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come and dine with me somewhere, Pa.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not altogether. Muriel's an {{excellent}} hostess; {{she will do}} her part, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> assist her. You have exceptional and rather dangerous gifts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it is true! Listen, Don Ippolito: it is {{the very}} thing that I hoped <b>you</b> would do, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to speak of it first. You must have all the honor of it, and I am glad you thought of it before. You will never regret it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{mean to be}} silly; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to {{know that}} I hadn't been idle all winter, and that, though I haven't much to tell, I'm quite {{satisfied}} with my chore," [...] she said, looking up with smiles shining through the tears till her face resembled a rose in a sun-shower.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would not}} be unusual, dear,--when there is money to be given. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> {{specially}} to {{ask him what he}} himself would propose to do. He knows already that I have taken a home for you and paid for it, and he knows--. But it does not signify going into that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peg, it ain't much wonder," [...] he went on, smoothly, [...] "and I'm not holdin' {{it against}} you. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> forget yourself--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Sylvie. [...] "Hush! I must think. I {{could go}} to him, by myself, well enough. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I only {{told her}} what I hoped," [...] he said quietly. [...] "That is all I dared say even to myself. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> listen to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't say any more," [...] said he; [...] "I can {{see that}} it only bothers <b>you.</b> <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to know, and now you do know, so it is all right. Thank you for {{listening}} so patiently and gently. Good-bye, little Sadie! I can't put my hand up. Will you put yours down?" ...|$|R
6000|$|This delighted Kinney {{as much as}} {{the last}} {{refinement}} of hospitality would have pleased another man. [...] "Look here!" [...] he said, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> should come out and see our camp. I can't fool away any more time on <b>you</b> here; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> should come out and see us. Give you something to write about. Hey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Kit coloured, but {{his mouth}} was rather hard and his look was steady. [...] "I did feel {{something}} like that. In the alameda you were amused and your amusement hurt. I was carried away, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you.</b> Well, <b>I</b> said if I brought back the men and got another post---- I did bring back the men and have got a better post." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Spencer," [...] he said, [...] "I am almost blind, and I cannot {{see your}} face, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{tell me the}} truth. I expect it from you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps it {{is better}} not to be rich, so that one may have {{something}} to do. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> tell me as though you really cared for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} to ask you to change your mind, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> listen to me for a minute. It's the last thing I shall ever ask you. Don't refuse me that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know why}} I came and why I won the cup," [...] he said. [...] "Perhaps I'm vain, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to see <b>I</b> could beat the others whose toys {{are all that}} occupy them. I have not their luck, and my object for coming drives me back to town. If I'm to realize my ambitions, I have got to work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{perfectly}} {{aware of}} that, and I {{feel that it}} would be mad for me to make an unsupported accusation against Sanders. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> three fellows to join me in watching Sanders play. My word, unsupported, would be of no avail; but if four of us swore that we saw him cheating, there could be no doubt about the result.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, with a {{quietness}} {{that was}} born of despair, [...] "there is nothing. Fate is too strong for us, Reggie, and you must go back now. It {{would have been better}} had I never promised that I would see you. I should not have done it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to understand that I couldn't help myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know you}} do. I know you don't want {{physical}} things by themselves. <b>But,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> give me--to give your spirit to me--that golden light which is you--which you don't know--give it me--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not. Don't I {{always tell}} you everything? I was ashamed {{to speak of}} it before the younger children, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know all the dreadful things I did at the Moffats'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One more request," [...] {{she became}} very solemn {{as she said}} this, [...] "it is not vital and {{necessary}} like the other, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do one thing for me, if you will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will not}} bandy words," [...] Rochester said. [...] "I have {{no wish to}} quarrel with <b>you,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> always to {{remember}} the things which I have said. Lois Champneyes is very nearly of age, it is true, but she remains a child by disposition and temperament. As her guardian, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to understand that I forbid you to continue your friendship or even your acquaintance with her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|She hesitated, {{and then}} went on: [...] "Perhaps I am boring <b>you,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to {{understand}} what his duty must have cost. You see, you only knew him in the bush, and after he went back I noted a difference in his letters. They were sometimes strange; {{he seemed to be}} hiding things. I think he felt the disappointment keenly and lost heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Andrew," [...] she whispered, [...] "I {{have been}} ashamed. I was wrong. That night--the {{thought of my}} pettiness--my foolish, selfish fears.--Oh, I was wrong! I have prayed that the time might come when I could tell you. And if you hadn't come, I never could have told you. I couldn't have written. I couldn't have come to London. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to know." ...|$|R
