5000|$|Dr. Ernest Hartmann {{observed}} {{that people who}} suffer frequent nightmares had distinctive personality characteristics he described as [...] "unguarded", [...] "undefended", [...] "vulnerable", [...] "artistic", and [...] "open". People with these characteristics seem unable to screen out frightening images and feelings originating in their dreams. They also lack barriers between their own identity and those of others, or between their own beliefs and unconventional ideas. Hartmann proposed that such people have [...] "thin" [...] boundaries between their mental processes and argued that thinness or thickness of boundaries was [...] "a <b>broad</b> <b>dimension</b> of personality and {{an aspect of the}} overall organization of the mind." [...] He considered the concept to be similar to William James' concept of [...] "tender-mindedness" [...] and to Blatt and Ritzler's [...] "permeable ego boundaries". The construct is measured with the Boundary Questionnaire which assesses thinness of boundaries in relation to a variety of areas, including boundaries between sleeping and waking, thoughts and feelings, and persons, places, and values. People with thick boundaries tend to see the world in [...] "black-and-white" [...] terms, whereas those with thin boundaries tend to be more aware of [...] "shades of gray". Women tend to have thinner boundaries than men, and boundaries tend to become thicker with age.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveMarital discord {{has been}} linked to both {{depression}} and anxiety; however, our understanding of how marriage contributes to the development of internalizing symptoms is limited in scope and lacking specificity. First, it is unclear whether the marital relationship contributes to the <b>broad</b> <b>dimension</b> of internalizing symptoms as opposed to specific diagnoses. Second, it is unclear how the marital relationship contributes to internalizing symptoms: through global marital dissatisfaction or through specific relationship processes (and which processes). The {{purpose of the present study}} was to address these two issues and, more generally, to develop a comprehensive and refined framework within which to understand the role of marriage in the developmental course of internalizing symptoms. MethodQuestionnaire and interview data were collected from 102 husbands and wives 5 times over the first 7 years of marriage. ResultsResults indicated that marital discord during the transition into marriage was associated with the <b>broad</b> <b>dimension</b> of internalizing symptoms for husbands but not for wives. Further, both global marital dissatisfaction and an imbalance of power and control put husbands at significant risk for symptoms over the first 7 years of marriage, whereas low levels of emotional intimacy put wives at significant risk. ConclusionsResults exemplify the need to routinely consider intimate relationship processes in etiological models of depression and anxiety, and identify specific clinical targets that can be prioritized in interventions aimed at preventing internalizing disorders. 5 F 31 MH 082571 - 03 /MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United StatesCCR 721682 /PHS HHS/United StatesCE 721682 /CE/NCIPC CDC HHS/United StatesF 31 MH 082571 /MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United StatesF 31 MH 082571 - 03 /MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United StatesHD 046789 /HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States 2012 - 10 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 21823784 PMC 318325...|$|E

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is known to improve these <b>broad</b> <b>dimensions</b> of psychopathology in addition to PD symptoms. However, {{little is known about}} the predictors of treatment response in comorbid psychiatric symptoms after CBT for PD. Recent studies suggest that anxiety sensitivity (AS) may be a key vulnerability for PD. This study aimed to examine AS as a predictor of <b>broad</b> <b>dimensions</b> of psychopathology after CBT for PD. Materials and methods: In total, 118 patients with PD were treated with manualized group CBT. We used multiple regression analysis to examine the associations between 3 Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) factors (physical concerns, mental incapacitation concerns, and social concerns) at baseline and the subscales of the Symptom Checklist- 90 Revised (SCL- 90 -R) at endpoint. Results: Low levels of social concerns at baseline predicted low levels on 5 SCL- 90 -R subscales after CBT: interpersonal sensitivity, depression, hostility, paranoid ideation, and psychosis. High levels of mental incapacitation concerns significantly predicted low levels on 3 SCL- 90 -R subscales after treatment: interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, and paranoid ideation. Physical concerns at baseline did not predict <b>broad</b> <b>dimensions</b> of psychopathology. Conclusion: This study suggested that the social concerns and mental incapacitation concerns subscales of the ASI at baseline predicted several dimensions of psychopathology after CBT for PD. To improve comorbid psychopathology, it may be useful to direct more attention to these ASI subscales.

Temperament profiles were examined in children with (a) neither internalizing nor externalizing problems, (b) only internalizing problems, (c) only externalizing problems, and (d) both internalizing and externalizing problems. The results suggest clearly diverging temperament profiles for these groups of children, with High-Intensity Pleasure and Shyness (representing the <b>broad</b> <b>dimension</b> of Surgency) steering the conditional probability of internalizing and externalizing problems (direction markers), Frustration mainly being related to maladaptation in general (severity marker), and Fear and Effortful Control being associated with both the severity and the direction of internalizing and externalizing problems, respectively.

40|$|According to Tellegen et al. ’s Two-factor model, commonalities between {{depression}} and anxiety are due to their shared variance with Negative affect (NA), a <b>broad</b> <b>dimension</b> of general distress.

A sample of 141 students at the Faculty of Philosophy in Novi Sad filled out a state measure of PA, NA, and basic emotions (SIAB-PANAS), a depression scale (BDI-II), and a state anxiety scale (STAI-S). Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to estimate the unique contributions of PA, NA, and basic emotions in the prediction of dysphoria and anxiety. The hypothesis that NA is a general dimension related to both dysphoria and anxiety was supported. Sadness and fear added incrementally to the prediction of both criteria. However, contrary to our hypothesis, PA was related to both dysphoria and anxiety. Joviality, attentiveness, and self-assurance were better predictors of anxiety than dysphoria.

The results of this study provide no evidence that banks in statewide branching environments provide better service to small businesses.

40|$|To {{study the}} psychometric {{properties}} of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF), we determined its dimensional structure, measurement invariance across presence of emotional disorders, the association of the CTQ-SF with an analogous interview-based measure (CTI) across presence of emotional disorders, and the incremental value of combining both instruments in determining associations with severity of psychopathology. The sample included 2, 308 adults, ages 18 - 65, consisting of unaffected controls and chronically affected and intermittently affected persons with an emotional disorder at Time 0 (T 0) or 4 years later at T 4. Childhood maltreatment was measured at T 0 with an interview and at T 4 with the CTQ-SF. At each wave, patients were assessed for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4 th ed., or DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) -based emotional disorders (Composite Interview Diagnostic Instrument) and symptom severity (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Fear Questionnaire). Besides the correlated original 5 -factor solution, an indirect higher order and direct bifactorial model also showed a good fit to the data. The 5 -factor solution proved to be invariant across disordered-control comparison groups. The CTQ-SF was moderately associated with the CTI, and this association was not attenuated by disorder status. The CTQ-SF was more sensitive in detecting emotional abuse and emotional neglect than the CTI. Combined CTQ-SF/CTI factor scores showed a higher association with severity of psychopathology. We conclude that although the original 5 -factor model fits the data well, results of the hierarchical analyses suggest that the total CTQ scale adequately captures a <b>broad</b> <b>dimension</b> of childhood maltreatment. A 2 -step measurement approach in the assessment of childhood trauma is recommended in which screening by a self-report questionnaire is followed by a (semi-) structured diagnostic interview...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to explore personality-related {{determinants}} of recidivism, with recidivism being defined as a) the number of lawful sentences a person had (criminal legal recidivism), and b) the number of prison sentences pronounced (penal recidivism). The study was carried out in two independent samples: a) convicts from the Correctional Institution of Belgrade - Penitentiary of Padinska Skela (N= 113), and b) convicts from the Special Prison Hospital in Belgrade (N = 112). The variables of the Five-Factor Model of Personality (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness) were measured, together with two additional basic personality traits: Disintegration (a <b>broad</b> <b>dimension</b> of psychosis-proneness), and Amorality (three factors representing a disposition to amoral forms of behavior). In addition, psychopathy (Manipulative and Antisocial tendencies) - a psychological entity expected to most successfully predict criminal recidivism - was measured as well. The efficiency of prediction of the two criteria of recidivism was assessed separately in each of those two samples. The results revealed differences in the orchestration of predictors depending on the kind of recidivism as the criterion and the severity of offense. The most important predictors of both forms of recidivism in the sample of convicts with lower intensity of criminal behavior were psychopathic traits. However, in the sample of convicts with higher intensity and variety of criminal behavior, the most important predictors of the number of sentences were Antisociality and Amorality Induced by Frustration, while the most important predictors of the number of prison sanctions were Amorality Induced by Brutality and Disintegration.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the present {{research}} was to clarify the role of marriage in the developmental course of internalizing symptoms (i. e., depression and anxiety). Aims were pursued in a community sample of 103 couples assessed five times over the first seven years of marriage, and results are presented in two separate parts. Although marital discord {{has been linked to}} both depression and anxiety, our understanding of how marriage contributes to the development of internalizing symptoms is limited in scope and lacking specificity. First, it is unclear whether the marital relationship contributes to the <b>broad</b> <b>dimension</b> of internalizing symptoms as opposed to specific diagnoses. Second, it is unclear how the marital relationship contributes to internalizing symptoms: through global marital dissatisfaction or through specific relationship processes (and which processes). The purpose of the research presented in Part 1 was to address these two issues. Further, marital discord is rarely incorporated into broader etiological frameworks of psychopathology (e. g., a diathesis-stress framework). The purpose of research presented in Part 2 was to develop and test a novel conceptual framework clarifying how specific marital processes (i. e., conflict management, partner support, emotional intimacy, and power and control), neuroticism, and stress work together to impact the development of internalizing symptoms over time. Results suggest that neuroticism contributes to the development of internalizing symptoms primarily through non-marital stress and an imbalance of power and control in one 2 ̆ 7 s marriage for husbands and through greater emotional disengagement for wives. Whereas stress originating outside of the marriage was more critical to the mental health of men, the marital relationship played a more central role for women. Marital processes remain significant predictors of internalizing symptoms when controlling for other well-established risk factors, demonstrating the need to routinely consider marital factors in etiological models of individual psychopathology. Further, results allow for the identification of specific clinical targets that can be prioritized in interventions aimed at preventing internalizing disorders. Specific recommendations for adapting marital preparation programs to prevent individual psychopathology are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A new grid {{measure of}} self-construction, the self-rep test, was used with 41 women; 21 were {{involved}} in outpatient therapy during the study and 20 were not. Each subject listed a total of 15 personal constructs concerning positive, negative, and ideal personal qualities. The elements on the grids were 15 roles. Subjects rated themselves for 14 days on these same constructs, constituting a second grid: the daily-rep test. For each rating day, subjects also completed the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List (MAACL), which measures depression, anxiety, and hostility, and rated themselves on various supplied dimensions relevant to mood and perceptions of the day 2 ̆ 7 s experiences. The level of depression was assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory and the mean MAACL depression score. Eight of the subjects (all of who were outpatients) were categorized as moderate-severely depressed. Three aspects of the construct system held to be relevant to depression were highlighted: constriction, negativeness, {{and the content of}} elicited constructs. The results failed to support the relationship of a measure of constriction (i. e., overuse of certain rating scale points) to the criterion measure. Contrary to expectation, subjects who elicited the constructs 2 ̆ 2 happy/sad, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 sensitive/insensitive, 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 hopeful/hopeless 2 ̆ 2 did not appear more depressed. The use of the construct 2 ̆ 2 happy 2 ̆ 2 was associated with relatively low depression. Greater negativeness of ratings was strongly associated with more severe depression. 2 ̆ 2 Slot rattling, 2 ̆ 2 or daily shifts in the sidedness of ratings, was generally associated with greater depression. However, the results suggested a curvilinar relationship. Among the moderately-severely depressed subjects, the greater the amount of slot rattling, the lower the depression scores, presumably because of the extreme negativity of the most depressed subjects. In general, measures which tapped a <b>broad</b> <b>dimension</b> of self-distress and negativity tended to relate to depression and to each other. Thus, meaningful aspects of the experience of depression were revealed through an exploration of self-construction, judgment of the self in varied social roles, and ratings of the self across days. ...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{paper from}} the International Cadastral Reform Conference 1992. Historically in most {{countries}} {{the broad range of}} land administration activities have developed in isolation or at best with weak linkages. The information revolution has put major pressures on these historical institutional structures. This has been especially evident in the areas associated with the management of spatial information which incorporate cadastral, land and geographic information systems. The last decade has seen the growth of three major thrusts in both government and society which are having a profound impact on the future management of these land information systems. The first has been the growth of importance of environmental management; this will surely be the high profile issue in the 1990 s {{as it was in the}} 1980 s. Secondly is the growth in importance of the management of cities and urban areas in both the developed and developing world, as the importance of cities as the engines of economic growth is increasingly recognised. Lastly is the move by governments world wide to privatisation of public services. This has a major impact on the management of spatial data. The above developments are coming into conflict in a number of jurisdictions as governments grapple with the competing interests within a general move to an information society. The ensuing debate increases substantially as governments in both the developed and developing world often believe that modern information technology (IT) alone will solve many of the problems in managing our environment and our cities, while at the same time returning hundreds of millions of dollars in savings in government expenditure. While there is some truth in the value of IT in these areas, the benefits and savings will only be achieved after major political, institutional, educational and technological changes. The lessons and politics from Victoria over the last decade or more are a reminder to other countries and jurisdictions that it is essential to understand the <b>broad</b> <b>dimension</b> of the management of land and geographic information, and the pitfalls if the interests of all "players" are not taken into account and a global view of the management of all spatial data is not taken.
