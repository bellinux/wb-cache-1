50|$|The MBMS {{feature is}} split into the MBMS <b>Bearer</b> <b>Service</b> and the MBMS User Service {{and has been}} defined to be offered over both UTRAN (i.e. WCDMA, TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA) and LTE (where it is often {{referred}} to as eMBMS). The MBMS <b>Bearer</b> <b>Service</b> includes a Unicast and a Broadcast Mode. MBMS Operation On-Demand (MOOD) allows dynamic switching between Unicast and Broadcast over LTE, based on configured triggers. The MBMS <b>Bearer</b> <b>Service</b> uses IP multicast addresses for the IP flows. The advantage of the MBMS <b>Bearer</b> <b>Service</b> compared to unicast bearer services (interactive, streaming, etc.) is that the transmission resources in the core and radio networks are shared. One MBMS packet flow is replicated by GGSN, SGSN and RNCs. MBMS may use an advanced counting scheme to decide, whether or not zero, one or more dedicated (i.e. unicast) radio channels lead to a more efficient system usage than one common (i.e. broadcast) radio channel.|$|E

Initially, the fundamental criterion used to make this decision was the number of MBMS users in a cell (UE Counting). In this paper we extend our previous work, which proposed the power transmitted by the Base Station (BS) as the channel switching criterion (Power Counting). We evaluate our approach and illustrate its capability to dynamically adapt to continuously varying cell conditions by selecting the transmission mode in a more efficient way, preserving in this way the network’s resources. At the same time we demonstrate the limitations of the conventional approach, in terms of radio resource efficiency.

It is seen that interference balancing maystraightforwardly be introduced in these systems, and thatsignificant capacity gains over non-balanced scenarios can beachieved. Secondly, how to best share traffic load between thedifferent sub-systems in a multi-access scenario isinvestigated. The capability to handle bearer services, andthereby also end-user services, typically differs betweensub-systems. The overall multi-access system capacity istherefore affected by the allocation of bearer services on tosub-systems. Based on this, a simple principle for findingfavorable, under certain constraints near-optimum, sub-systembearer service allocations is derived. It is seen that for agiven service mix combined capacities beyond the sum of thesub-system capacities may be achieved by using the favorablebearer service allocations. Significant capacity gains are alsoseen in a case study in which the <b>bearer</b> <b>service</b> allocationprinciple is applied to a combined GSM/EDGE and WCDMAmulti-access system. The <b>bearer</b> <b>service</b> type may be said toreflect an expected radio resource cost for supporting a userin each sub-system.
