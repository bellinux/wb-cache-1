Two months after the marriage, Anne gave birth to the couple's first child, who had obviously been conceived out of wedlock. Until near the end of Anne's life, some observers disapproved of James' decision to marry Anne, but not King Charles II, James' brother, who wanted the marriage to take place. Another cause of disapproval was the public affection James showed toward Anne, such as kissing and leaning against each other, which was considered improper behaviour from man to wife during the seventeenth century.|$|E

5|$|However, off northeastern Brazil, {{the female}} {{reproductive}} cycle is short enough to occur annually. Vitellogenesis (the formation of yolk within the ovary) {{occurs in the}} late summer, and is immediately followed by mating and fertilization in the fall, with the young being <b>born</b> <b>the</b> following spring to summer. The seasonality of these events means the reproductive cycle is offset by six months between populations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The gestation period has been variously estimated at eight months off northeastern Brazil and 911 months off the southeastern United States.|$|E
