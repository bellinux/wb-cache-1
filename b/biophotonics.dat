40|$|The {{processing}} of neural information in neural circuits plays key roles in neural functions. Biophotons, also called ultra-weak photon emissions (UPE), may play potential roles in neural signal transmission, {{contributing to the}} understanding of the high functions of nervous system such as vision, learning and memory, cognition and consciousness. However, the experimental analysis of <b>biophotonic</b> activities (emissions) in neural circuits has been hampered due to technical limitations. Here by developing and optimizing an in vitro biophoton imaging method, we characterize the spatiotemporal <b>biophotonic</b> activities and transmission in mouse brain slices. We show that the long-lasting application of glutamate to coronal brain slices produces a gradual and significant increase of <b>biophotonic</b> activities and achieves the maximal effect within approximately 90 min, which then lasts for a relatively long time (> 200 min). The initiation and/or maintenance of <b>biophotonic</b> activities by glutamate can be significantly blocked by oxygen and glucose deprivation, together with the application of a cytochrome c oxidase inhibitor (sodium azide), but only partly by an action potential inhibitor (TTX), an anesthetic (procaine), or the removal of intracellular and extracellular Ca(2 +). We also show that the detected <b>biophotonic</b> activities in the corpus callosum and thalamus in sagittal brain slices mostly originate from axons or axonal terminals of cortical projection neurons, and that the hyperphosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein tau leads to a significant decrease of <b>biophotonic</b> activities in these two areas. Furthermore, the application of glutamate in the hippocampal dentate gyrus results in increased <b>biophotonic</b> activities in its intrahippocampal projection areas. These results suggest that the glutamate-induced <b>biophotonic</b> activities reflect <b>biophotonic</b> transmission along the axons and in neural circuits, which may be a new mechanism for the {{processing of}} neural information...|$|R
40|$|Cell to cell {{communication}} by biophotons {{has been demonstrated}} in plants, bacteria, animal neutrophil granulocytes and kidney cells. Whether such signal communication exists in neural cells is unclear. By developing a new biophoton detection method, called in situ biophoton autography (IBA), we have investigated <b>biophotonic</b> activities in rat spinal nerve roots in vitro. We found that different spectral light stimulation (infrared, red, yellow, blue, green and white) {{at one end of}} the spinal sensory or motor nerve roots resulted in a significant increase in the <b>biophotonic</b> activity at the other end. Such effects could be significantly inhibited by procaine (a regional anaesthetic for neural conduction block) or classic metabolic inhibitors, suggesting that light stimulation can generate biophotons that conduct along the neural fibers, probably as neural communication signals. The mechanism of <b>biophotonic</b> conduction along neural fibers may be mediated by protein-protein <b>biophotonic</b> interactions. This study may provide a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of neural communication, the functions of the nervous system, such as vision, learning and memory, as well as the mechanisms of human neurological diseases...|$|R

40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of mortality, {{resulting}} in 17. 3 million deaths per year globally. Although cardiovascular disease accounts for approximately 30 % of deaths in the United States, many deleterious events can be mitigated or prevented if detected and treated early. Indeed, early intervention and healthier behaviour adoption can reduce the relative risk of first heart attacks by up to 80 % compared to those who do not adopt new healthy behaviours. Cardiovascular monitoring is a vital component of disease detection, mitigation, and treatment. The cardiovascular system is an incredibly dynamic system that constantly adapts to internal and external stimuli. Monitoring cardiovascular function and response is vital for disease detection and monitoring. <b>Biophotonic</b> technologies provide unique solutions for cardiovascular assessment and monitoring in naturalistic and clinical settings. These technologies leverage the properties of light as it enters and interacts with the tissue, providing safe and rapid sensing that can be performed in many different environments. Light entering into human tissue undergoes a complex series of absorption and scattering events according to both the illumination and tissue properties. The field of quantitative biomedical optics seeks to quantify physiological processes by analysing the remitted light characteristics relative to the controlled illumination source. Drawing inspiration from contact-based <b>biophotonic</b> sensing technologies such as pulse oximetry and near infrared spectroscopy, we explored the feasibility of widefield hemodynamic assessment using computational <b>biophotonic</b> imaging. Specifically, we investigated the hypothesis that computational <b>biophotonic</b> imaging can assess spatial and temporal properties of pulsatile blood flow across large tissue regions. This thesis presents the design, development, and evaluation of a novel photoplethysmographic imaging system for assessing spatial and temporal hemodynamics in major pulsatile vasculature through the sensing and processing of subtle light intensity fluctuations arising from local changes in blood volume. This system co-integrates methods from biomedical optics, electronic control, and biomedical image and signal processing to enable non-contact widefield hemodynamic assessment over large tissue regions. A <b>biophotonic</b> optical model was developed to quantitatively assess transient blood volume changes in a manner that does not require a priori information about the tissue's absorption and scattering characteristics. A novel automatic blood pulse waveform extraction method was developed to encourage passive monitoring. This spectral-spatial pixel fusion method uses physiological hemodynamic priors to guide a probabilistic framework for learning pixel weights across the scene. Pixels are combined according to their signal weight, resulting in a single waveform. Widefield hemodynamic imaging was assessed in three biomedical applications using the aforementioned developed system. First, spatial vascular distribution was investigated across a sample with highly varying demographics for assessing common pulsatile vascular pathways. Second, non-contact <b>biophotonic</b> assessment of the jugular venous pulse waveform was assessed, demonstrating clinically important information about cardiac contractility function in a manner which is currently assessed through invasive catheterization. Lastly, non-contact <b>biophotonic</b> assessment of cardiac arrhythmia was demonstrated, leveraging the system's ability to extract strong hemodynamic signals for assessing subtle fluctuations in the waveform. This research demonstrates that this novel approach for computational <b>biophotonic</b> hemodynamic imaging offers new cardiovascular monitoring and assessment techniques, which can enable new scientific discoveries and clinical detection related to cardiovascular function...|$|R

50|$|For <b>biophotonic</b> applications, {{the most}} {{commonly}} used laser diodes are edge emitting/ridge waveguide diodes, which are single transverse mode and can be optimized to an almost perfect TEM00 beam quality. Due to the small size of the resonator, digital modulation can be very fast (up to 500 MHz). Coherence length is low (typically < 1 mm) and the typical linewidth is in the nm-range. Typical power levels are around 100 mW (depending on wavelength and supplier).Key suppliers are: Coherent, Melles Griot, Omicron, Toptica, JDSU, Newport, Oxxius, Power Technology.Grating stabilized diode lasers either have an lithographical incorporated grating (DFB, DBR) or an external grating (ECDL). As a result, the coherence length will raise into the range of several meters, whereas the linewidth will drop well below picometers (pm). <b>Biophotonic</b> applications, which make use of this characteristics are Raman spectroscopy (requires linewidth below cm-1) and spectroscopic gas sensing.|$|R

Protein variants with altered photocycles are further studied by using time-resolved Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and Fourier transform terahertz (FT-THz) spectroscopy. Protein variants are constructed by using site-directed and semi-random mutagenesis techniques. The results endorse the use of semi-random mutagenesis combined with spectroscopic methods to identify protein variants with novel photokinetic properties. ...|$|R
