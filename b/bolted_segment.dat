40|$|<b>Bolted,</b> <b>segmented</b> {{cylindrical}} shells are {{a common}} structural component in many engineering systems especially for aerospace launch vehicles. Segmented shells are often needed due to limitations of manufacturing capabilities or transportation issues related to very long, large-diameter cylindrical shells. These cylindrical shells typically have a flange or ring welded to opposite ends so that shell segments can be mated together and bolted to form a larger structural system. As the diameter of these shells increases, maintaining strict fabrication tolerances for the flanges to be flat and parallel on a welded structure is an extreme challenge. Local fit-up stresses develop in the structure due to flange mating-surface mismatch (flange waviness). These local stresses {{need to be considered}} when predicting a critical initial flaw size. Flange waviness is one contributor to the fit-up stress state. The present paper describes the modeling and analysis effort to simulate fit-up stresses due to flange waviness in a typical <b>bolted,</b> <b>segmented</b> cylindrical shell. Results from parametric studies are presented for various flange mating-surface waviness distributions and amplitudes I...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} paper {{describes a}} calculation model for pre-stressed bolted joints used to connect slewing bearings to the adjacent structures. A classical pre-stressed bolted joint calculation model is described and its insufficiencies for direct application on slewing bearings are pointed out. Finally, the suggested stress analysis {{is done by}} modelling the most loaded single <b>bolt</b> <b>segment</b> of the slewing bearing assembly, applying the preload and the working load on it. The stress determination in the bolt is done by finite element analysis...|$|R
50|$|The MTB 1925 {{is fed from}} Carcano M91 clips {{that fall}} out of the bottom when the {{magazine}} is empty. The magazine follower closely resembles that of the M91. Despite appearing to be semiautomatic, it actually functions as a straight-pull manually-operated bolt action. The massive cylindrical bolt is in two sections of roughly equal size, front and rear. The rear section rotates when the bolt is opened via a spiral cam slot cut into it on the right side (possibly on the left as well, covered by the receiver). The front <b>bolt</b> <b>segment</b> does not turn.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{high-strength}} {{rock bolt}} {{in the underground}} often occured brittle fracture in the threaded section, this {{is closely related to}} bolt material impact toughness. Tested the impact absorbed energy of four manufacturers of the yield strength of 500 MPa rock bolt and the impact absorbed energy value ranging from 19 J to 165 J. Tested bending test of the bolt rod and threaded section that has a different impact absorbed energy, the results showed that: the impact toughness affects the cold bending of the rock <b>bolt</b> thread <b>segment,</b> when the impact absorbed energy value is less than 30 J rock <b>bolt</b> thread <b>segment</b> cold bending poor; impact toughness has no obvious affect on the cold bending of rod...|$|R
2500|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{construction was}} {{the first of its kind}} in Australia. Unlike previous lighthouse using <b>bolted</b> <b>segments</b> of cast iron, the first of which were Troubridge Island Lighthouse constructed in 1856 in South Australia and the original Breaksea Island Light constructed in 1858 in Western Australia, as well as Sandy Cape Light and Bustard Head Light in Queensland, the tower used wrought iron [...] plates mounted on a timber frame which supplied the structural strength, where the iron plates act as cladding. This was a cheaper method of construction, and following lighthouses in Queensland used this method predominantly. The iron cladding was prefabricated in England and shipped to the island in pieces, together with the imported lens, lantern and operating apparatus. The timber framing was prefabricated in Brisbane and shipped to the site. The light was originally a flashing 4,000cd light.|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the phenomenon of}} performance deterioration in fully grouted rock bolts in tunnels with a dry, hot environment and high geothermal activity {{with a focus on}} temperature effects on interfacial bond performance. Three groups of fully grouted rock bolt specimens were designed based on similar mechanical principles. They were produced and maintained at 20 °C, 35 °C, and 50 °C. Through the indoor gradual loading tensile test of specimens, variations of axial force and shear stress between the rock bolt and mortar adhesive interface were obtained under different environmental temperatures. Distribution of the axial force and shear stress on the anchorage section were found under different tensile forces. Results showed that, with an increase in specimen environmental temperature, maximum shear stress of the rock bolt section became smaller, while shear stress distribution along the rock <b>bolt</b> <b>segment</b> became more uniform. In addition, the axial force value at the same position along the pull end was greater, while axial stress along the anchorage’s length decayed faster. With an increase in tensile force under different temperatures, the axial force and maximum shear stress of rock bolt specimens along the anchorage section has a corresponding increase...|$|R

It {{is also one of the}} first in Australia to be constructed using <b>bolted</b> prefabricated <b>segments</b> of cast iron, and one of only two such lighthouses in Queensland, the other being its sibling, Sandy Cape Light. It serves as the central relay for Dent Island Light, Pine Islet Light and Lady Elliot Island Light and as the radio check post for Cape Capricorn Light, Sandy Cape Light and Double Island Point Light.|$|R
5000|$|Under {{the river}} itself, the tunnels started in rock, using drill and blast, but the strata under {{the river was}} pure mud for a {{considerable}} depth, so this part was driven under compressed air, using a Greathead shield, and lined with cast-iron <b>segments</b> <b>bolted</b> together. The mud was such that the shield was shoved blind, i.e. taking in no ground at all. But it was found easier to steer if some mud was taken in through holes at the front. The mud was the consistency of toothpaste.|$|R
50|$|The breech {{was closed}} by a bolt {{similar to those}} of more modern rifles to follow. Amongst the {{technical}} features of interest introduced in 1866 on the Chassepot rifle was the method of obturation of the <b>bolt</b> by a <b>segmented</b> rubber ring which expanded under gas pressure and thus sealed the breech when the shot was fired. This simple yet effective technology was successfully adapted to artillery in 1877 by Colonel de Bange, who invented grease-impregnated asbestos pads to seal the breech of his new cannons (the De Bange system).|$|R
50|$|This {{is a type}} of {{maintaining}} power which needs to be engaged before re-winding is started. It consists of a weighted arm (bolt) with a ratchet pawl on the end of it which engages with the edge of the first wheel to keep it turning while the weight or spring is wound. To make sure that it was always operated, the hole in the dial through which the clock is wound is covered with a shutter which can be moved out of the way by pushing down on a lever {{at the side of the}} dial. This lever also engages the bolt. A similar type of mechanism is sometimes used on turret clocks. Because these take much longer to wind, and are usually wound by trained staff, the <b>bolt</b> carries a <b>segment</b> of a gear wheel rather than a single pawl and is engaged manually.|$|R
25|$|The lantern {{room with}} {{hemispherical}} dome roof sits {{on top of}} the tower and is accessed via a hatchway in the floor which is lined with lead. All optics have been removed from the lantern, but a pedestal similar to the original has been recently installed. The cylindrical lantern base is constructed from 4.5mm thick steel plates, with a hatch door on the northern side to allow access to the exterior gallery. Its middle section consists of eight trapezoidal frames, five of which are glazed. The remaining three frames (on the western side) are filled with galvanized sheeting with diagonal bracing. The dome is made from eight steel <b>segments</b> <b>bolted</b> together with additional bar stiffeners. It is painted red on the exterior and topped with a ventilator cowl. The narrow gallery that encircles the lantern has a hardwood timber floor supported by cast iron brackets, and a lightweight tubular balustrade, also painted red.|$|R
40|$|Lightweight, transparent, long-spanned, and {{high-rise}} constructions {{characterize the}} vision of many architects. Glass is at present the best-performing material where high transparency and durability are the main requisites, but its brittleness limits its ability to provide structural engineered solutions. Large-spanned glass beams are most often built with multiple splice lamination, but this technique presents some problems, such as increased dead load and lack of redundancy, ductility, structural hierarchy, and economy. An alternative strategy has been developed {{in the form of}} multiple <b>segmented</b> <b>bolted</b> beams, but the holes this requires inevitably weaken the glass. Using the results of a 10 - year-long theoretical and experimental study carried out at the University of Pisa and following the principles of fail-safe design, the main purpose of this work is to present a new static concept for hybrid, segmented, esogen–endogen-compressed, and buckling-restrained glass structures. This concept represents the latest evolution of both the Travi Vitree Tensegrity (TVT) and the Solidi Vitrei Tensegrity (SVT) constructional systems. Finite element models (FEM) calibrated on the experimental findings demonstrate the feasibility of the new concept and its good performance at the ultimate and serviceability-limit states...|$|R
40|$|Tunnel linings in situ {{are rarely}} truly {{circular}} in form. Shapes depend on {{factors such as}} the nature of the lining, method of build, connections between segments, self-weight deformations and ground stresses. A small-scale two-dimensional simplified tunnel lining model comprising six segments was developed where the lining was loaded using a reaction ring. The results provide insight into factors that control the lining response: e. g. the deformed shape depends {{on the nature of the}} imposed loading, tightness of the <b>bolts,</b> number of <b>segments</b> and joint flexibility. This small-scale model was developed as a precursor to a sophisticated large-scale structural model used to assess the effect of tunnelling on existing tunnels (Yu et al., 2017). In this respect it proved very instructive, especially for assessing the method of loading the ring. An important message from the paper is how an inexpensive, but carefully thought out, small-scale model can provide great insight to the development of large-scale models that will involve orders of magnitude more time and expense. Many of the findings from the small-scale study were verified by the more realistic large-scale model which was able to provide details on deformations and stress changes in the <b>segments</b> and <b>bolts...</b>|$|R
40|$|Large {{solid rocket}} motors, as {{found on the}} Space Shuttle, are {{fabricated}} in segments for manufacturing considerations, bolted together, and sealed using conventional Viton O-ring seals. Similarly the nine large solid rocket motor nozzles are assembled from several different <b>segments,</b> <b>bolted</b> together, and sealed at six joint locations using conventional O-ring seals. The 5500 F combustion gases are generally kept a safe distance away from the seals by thick layers of phenolic or rubber insulation. Joint-fill compounds, including RTV (room temperature vulcanized compound) and polysulfide filler, are used to fill the joints in the insulation to prevent a direct flow-path to the O-rings. Normally these two stages of protection are enough to prevent a direct flow-path of the 900 -psi hot gases from reaching the temperature-sensitive O-ring seals. However, in the current design 1 out of 15 Space Shuttle solid rocket motors experience hot gas effects on the Joint 6 wiper (sacrificial) O-rings. Also worrisome {{is the fact that}} joints have experienced heat effects on materials between the RTV and the O-rings, and in two cases O-rings have experienced heat effects. These conditions lead to extensive reviews of the post-flight conditions as part of the effort to monitor flight safety. We have developed a braided carbon fiber thermal barrier to replace the joint fill compounds in the Space Shuttle solid rocket motor nozzles to reduce the incoming 5500 F combustion gas temperature and permit only cool (approximately 100 F) gas to reach the temperature-sensitive O-ring seals. Implementation of this thermal barrier provides more robust, consistent operation with shorter turn around times between Shuttle launches...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{testing and}} finite element (FE) analysis {{described in this}} paper {{were part of a}} major research project undertaken at Imperial College London to investigate the deformation of bolted segmental grey cast iron (GCI) tunnel linings. A key aim was to quantify how joints influence the behaviour of the lining, through a three-path approach comprising physical experiments, finite element modelling, and field instrumentation. The laboratory results have been used to assess the validity of the tunnel assessment methods used by industry. This study examined joint articulation under the serviceability limit state in the absence of hoop force focussing on factors such as applied bolt preload, the loading direction and the freedom of the circumferential flange to deflect. Two half-scale GCI lining <b>segments</b> were <b>bolted</b> together at the longitudinal flanges to form a bolted arch in a similar fashion to the tests performed by Thomas (1977). Modern instrumentation was implemented to gain detailed measurements quantifying changes in global displacements of the two <b>segments,</b> <b>bolt</b> forces and joint opening under applied loading. For the first time, the physical experiments were conducted contemporaneously with the development of a three-dimensional FE model of the joint. The experimental data and the results from the FE analysis indicate a reduction in joint stiffness as the joint articulates under applied load. It is shown that the presence of a joint has far greater influence on the behaviour of the ‘arch’ than the level of preload applied to the bolts in the joint. The FE analysis allowed the deformation behaviour of the joint under positive and negative bending to be investigated: its response under the two modes differs significantly...|$|R
