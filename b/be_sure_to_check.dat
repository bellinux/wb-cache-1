25|$|The Artois Hound {{does not}} require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth {{short-haired}} coat is easy to look after. Owners will simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. A wipe down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although you should bathe it with mild soap only if or when necessary; you should also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. <b>Be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).|$|E

5000|$|Actress Pat Carroll and the Ursula animators pump {{astonishing}} gobs of rotten-flirty menace and perversity into Witch Ursula, {{who looks}} {{a bit like the}} late actor Divine pasted over with an evil Jack Nicholson leer and squeezed into a cleavage-popping black evening gown, tailing off startlingly into eight squiggling black octopus tentacles. With her pet moray eels, she is a genuine nightmare, an obese lavender voluptuary peeling off lines like [...] "Lifes full of hard choices [...] [...] [...] Int it?" [...] with blowzy relish or erupting from the ocean like Moby Dick on bonbons. The Los Angeles Times Michael Wilmington William Thomas of Empire described Ursula as [...] "truly quake-inducing", while Times Eliana Dockterman enjoyed the fact that, unlike previous Disney villains, [...] "Ursula doesn’t even pretend to be good ... Right off the bat, she owns her evil witchiness". Kilmeny Fane-Saunders, writing for Radio Times, warned parents that Ursula could possibly frighten young children. However, The Huffington Posts Hilary Sheinbau believes that [...] "there are many of these people who walk ... talk and strive among us", concluding, [...] "it’s important for kids to know that not everyone is going to look out for their best interests, however tempting some offers may be." [...] Metros Duncan Lindsay agreed that Ursula teaches children [...] "that binding contracts are a necessary part of every deal. We can thank her for all of our business sense as we <b>are</b> always <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> triple <b>check</b> that paperwork when ... securing deals." [...] Dave Smith of the Disney Archives wrote, [...] "When anger does bring out her true emotion, the effects are staggering. Her look of stark hatred, even while her face is still human, must certainly have brought nightmares to young children. And when she finally changes into a giant, towering up through the waves and over puny mortals, the embodiment of fury is quite breathtaking." [...] Smith concluded, [...] "Earlier we may have chuckled at her villainy; at this moment, there is no laughter ... only genuine fear." [...] Meanwhile, SMOSHs Francesco Marciuliano praised the character as [...] "one of the most gleefully evil characters Disney has ever created." ...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION One of {{the first}} things we agreed to as an {{editorial}} staff was that our university???s literary journal needed an updated title. There was nothing inherently wrong with the name Island Fox, per se, but we preferred something that might better demonstrate the joie de vivre of writing. After batting about a few names, we settled on MYUZ ??? a nod of appreciation to the nine daughters of Zeus ??? the Greek goddesses of artistic inspiration. A muse is something (or someone) every writer needs ??? an inspirational influence to whisper in their ear, to help lift their words and voice above the mundane. During this past year, newspapers, television, and internet blogs have been filled with bad news ??? some of it terrifying. Here in Ventura County we were jolted by the huge loss of life in the Chatsworth Metrolink crash ??? the worst train accident in California history. We have decided to open our journal this year with a non-fiction piece by Joshua Bauer that deals with this tragedy. Bauer begins his first person narrative with a group of friends getting together for a few games of bowling. The Metrolink disaster, which had happened just two days before, is not really on their radar. The story takes a dramatic turn when Katie, a young woman who had been quiet all evening, suddenly reveals the news that a friend of theirs from high school was one of the Metrolink victims. Another short story you???ll <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> want <b>to</b> <b>check</b> out is Bishara, Avi, Always, Kristi Kellog???s narrative of what happens when a conservative Hindu boy meets a worldly Indian girl hell-bent on winning a major beauty contest. Poetry is well represented in this year???s journal, making up about one-half of the entries. Adam Piccirilli electrifies us with his love poem Arc Eyes, Sara Parker introduces us to the horrors of nursing home life in A Part of Adulthood I???d Rather Avoid, and Krista Wilbur, last year???s managing editor, takes us into the dark, blood-stained alleys of poesie noir with Kaleidoscope. Current events were popular with our submitters this year; Sara Parker comes through again, delivering a sarcastic political elbow-punch with Hooray For Proposition 8, Chris O???Neal tells us the advantages of pet ownership during a recessionary economy in Do Rabbits Dream of Electric People, and Sean Colletti???s esoteric Now Serving Number 44 will have you puzzling over its meaning. Look closely ??? the clues are there. Our editorial committee offers up their own contributions, of course. MYUZ???s mamma capa, Kellie Griffin, brings us into the lives of two young friends {{on their way to a}} blood test in Transposition, Julie Fontes shows us what can happen when you meet up with your past at a downtown club in And Hearts, and Guy MacLaury illustrates the perils of beachcombing after dark in Jamaica with A Walk on the Seven Mile Beach. In addition, Luis Maranan takes us into the gravity-prone forest of One Hundred Hills, there???s the aforementioned reflective non-fiction short story from Joshua Bauer ??? Spared ??? and George Morgan squeezes in a few pages with a story about cul-de-sac culture, helicopters, and Polynesian cannabis in Where the Road Ends. We broke some new ground this year, using technology in innovative ways. This is the first time the CSUCI literary journal has been published by an online publishing company: lulu. com. This will allow copies of MYUZ to be available in perpetuity. All in all we believe our readers will enjoy the writing in this year???s campus journal. It???s been a pleasure putting it together. If you have any comments, or ideas to improve the next one, please write to us at island. fox@csuci. edu. The MYUZ Committe...|$|R
