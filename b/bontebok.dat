5|$|Molecular {{studies have}} {{supported}} monophyly {{in the family}} Bovidae (a group of organisms comprises an ancestral species and all their descendants). The number of subfamilies in Bovidae is disputed, with suggestions {{of as many as}} ten and as few as two subfamilies. However, molecular, morphological and fossil evidence indicates the existence of eight distinct subfamilies : Aepycerotinae (consisting of just the impala), Alcelaphinae (<b>bontebok,</b> hartebeest, wildebeest and relatives), Antilopinae (several antelopes, gazelles, and relatives), Bovinae (cattle, buffaloes, bison and other antelopes), Caprinae (goats, sheep, ibex, serows and relatives), Cephalophinae (duikers), Hippotraginae (addax, oryx and relatives) and Reduncinae (reedbuck and kob antelopes). In addition, three extinct subfamilies are known: Hypsodontinae (mid-Miocene), Oiocerinae (Turolian) and the subfamily Tethytraginae, which contains Tethytragus (mid-Miocene).|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gemsbok, sable antelope, and Grant's gazelle, are camouflaged with {{strongly}} disruptive facial markings that {{conceal the}} highly recognisable eye. Many species, such as gazelles, may be made to look flat, and hence to blend into the background, by countershading. The outlines of many bovids are broken up with bold disruptive colouration, the strongly contrasting patterns helping to delay recognition by predators. However, all the Hippotraginae (including the gemsbok) have pale bodies and faces with conspicuous markings. The zoologist Tim Caro describes this as difficult to explain, but given that the species are diurnal, he suggests that the markings may function in communication. Strongly contrasting leg colouration is common only in the Bovidae, where for example Bos, Ovis, <b>bontebok</b> and gemsbok have white stockings. Again, communication is the likely function.|$|E
25|$|The alcephine bovids (wildebeests, hartebeests, hirola, <b>bontebok,</b> blesbok, {{and several}} similar species) have preorbital glands which secrete complex {{mixtures}} of chemical compounds. The preorbital glands of the <b>bontebok</b> (Damaliscus pygargus pygarus) are larger in males than in females. Their secretions contain at least forty different chemical compounds, and are deposited on grass and twigs at {{the borders of}} their territory. They then appear to transfer the secretions from the grass to their horns and forehead by waving the {{head from side to}} side across the stalk bearing the secretion. Marking of plant stalks with preorbital gland secretions is seen in both sexes. In contrast to the duikers and raphicerids, the klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus) is a semi-gregarious species, while the hirola (Beatragus hunteri) is fully gregarious. Nevertheless, these animals display territorial scent marking of grasses with secretions from their preorbital glands.|$|E

5000|$|This exhibit {{features}} <b>bonteboks,</b> reticulated giraffes, African bush elephants, hippos, and Eastern black rhinos. On March 11, 2016, six African elephants {{arrived at}} the zoo from Swaziland to escape a drought.|$|R
50|$|The {{subfamily}} Alcelaphinae of {{the family}} Bovidae contains wildebeest, hartebeest, <b>bonteboks</b> and several similar species. Depending on the classification, there are either seven, nine or ten species in four genera, although Beatragus is sometimes considered a subgenus of Damaliscus, and Sigmoceros for the Lichtensteins hartebeest.|$|R
25|$|Formerly {{known as}} Heart of Africa, {{these are two}} of the park's major exhibits. Visitors go down a trail which {{replicates}} habitats in Africa. The exhibit begins in African Woods with scrub animals - vultures, lesser kudu, and giant eland. It then progresses to forest (okapi, duikers, and wattled cranes). The path then leads to African Outpost, which features plains animals - <b>bontebok,</b> common warthogs, ground hornbills, and cheetahs - against a backdrop of the open-range East Africa exhibit. A central lagoon has lesser and greater flamingos, waterfowl, an island with colobus monkeys, and an interpretive research camp on a separate island.|$|E
500|$|The wildebeest, or {{the genus}} Connochaetes, is {{placed under the}} family Bovidae and {{subfamily}} Alcelaphinae, where its closest relatives are the hartebeest (Alcelaphus spp.), the hirola (Beatragus hunteri) and species in the genus Damaliscus, such as the topi, the tsessebe, the blesbok and the <b>bontebok.</b> The name Connochaetes was given by German zoologist Hinrich Lichtenstein in 1812. Wildebeest were first discovered about 1700 by Dutch settlers {{on their way to}} the interior of South Africa. Due to their resemblance to wild cattle, these people called them [...] "wild ox" [...] or [...] "wildebeest". The blue wildebeest was first known to westerners in the northern part of South Africa a century later, in the 1800s.|$|E
2500|$|African elephants, white rhinos, and giraffe {{are joined}} by zebras, Grant's gazelle, and {{ostriches}} in this area. [...] African cranes, <b>bontebok,</b> lechwe and scimitar oryx also live here. The zoo finished enlarging the elephant exhibit in 2006; it now features a pool that allows elephants to submerse and bathe.|$|E
50|$|Consisting {{of several}} large yards, the African Savanna {{features}} {{a variety of}} mammals and birds. The exhibit houses animals such as Masai giraffes, Grant's zebras, <b>bonteboks,</b> ostriches, grey crowned cranes, {{as well as several}} species of African storks and geese. Visitors can also feed the giraffes from the viewing decks {{at the southern end of}} the enclosure during the warmer months.|$|R
2500|$|The Africa Savanna exhibit {{opened in}} April 1989 and is [...] in size. This exhibit {{includes}} animals typical of East Africa and includes an aviary and areas for large mammals. These include black rhinoceros, De Brazza's monkey, hippopotamus, <b>bontebok,</b> naked mole-rat, reticulated giraffe, masai giraffe, gerenuk, Speke's gazelle, southern ground hornbill, weaver birds, Cape thick-knee, red-crested turaco, hamerkop, buffalo weaver, hingeback tortoises, and spiny-tailed lizards. The zoo kept a zebra named Citation {{until her death}} in 2013.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bontebok</b> (Damaliscus pygargus) is an {{antelope}} {{found in}} South Africa, Lesotho and Namibia. The <b>bontebok</b> has two subspecies; the <b>bontebok</b> (Damaliscus pygargus pygargus), occurring naturally in the Fynbos and Renosterveld {{areas of the}} Western Cape, and the blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi) occurring in the highveld.|$|E
50|$|Three nature {{reserves}} are situated near Swellendam, Marloth Nature Reserve, Sanbona Wildlife Reserve and <b>Bontebok</b> National Park. <b>Bontebok</b> National Park {{is where the}} rare <b>bontebok</b> was protected when {{it was close to}} extinction. The population has increased from 17 individuals in 1931 to a sustainable number today.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bontebok</b> {{is related}} to the common tsessebe.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bontebok</b> is a tall, {{medium-sized}} antelope. They typically stand 80 to 100 cm high at {{the shoulder}} and measure 120 to 210 cm along the head and body. The tail can range from 30 to 60 cm. Body mass can vary from 50 to 155 kg. Males are slightly larger and noticeably heavier than females. The <b>bontebok</b> is a chocolate brown colour, with a white underside and a white stripe from the forehead {{to the tip of}} the nose, although there is a brown stripe across the white near the eyes in most blesbok. The <b>bontebok</b> also has a distinctive white patch around its tail (whence the Latin name), while this patch is light brown/tan in blesbok. The horns of <b>bontebok</b> are lyre-shaped and clearly ringed. They are found in both sexes and can reach a length of half a metre.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bontebok</b> National Park is a species-specific {{national}} park in South Africa. It was established in 1931 to ensure {{the preservation of the}} <b>Bontebok.</b> It is the smallest of South Africa's 20 National Parks, covering an area of 27.86 km2 The park is part of the Cape Floristic Region, which is a World Heritage Site.|$|E
50|$|Bonteboks are rare, unusually marked antelopes. They {{are listed}} as {{vulnerable}} in Appendix II of the International Trade in Endangered Species Red List. They are endemic to the Cape Floral area, and once roamed the region in large numbers. European settlement and hunting brought the animal to near extinction by the early 19th century. A relict population was protected on private farmland. In 1931, seventeen members of this population were translocated to the first <b>Bontebok</b> National Park. In the 1960s, half of the population died from worm infestations, copper deficiency and related syndromes. In 1961, 61 members of the surviving population were translocated to the current <b>Bontebok</b> National Park. The worldwide <b>bontebok</b> population of 2,500-3,000 individuals are all derived from this population.|$|E
50|$|The only {{indigenous}} southern African mammals {{that are}} not there are <b>bontebok,</b> blesbuck, spotted hyena, nyala and roan antelope.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bontebok</b> is a {{small village}} in Heerenveen in the {{province}} of Friesland, the Netherlands. It had a population of around 445 in 2006.|$|E
50|$|The Kragga Kamma Game Park {{is home to}} the {{southern}} white rhinoceros, South African cheetah, Burchell's zebra, South African giraffe, nyala, <b>bontebok,</b> lechwe and African buffalo.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bontebok</b> are {{not good}} jumpers, {{but they are very}} good at {{crawling}} under things. Mature males form territories and face down other males in displays and occasionally combat.|$|E
50|$|Two {{of these}} only ever {{occurred}} within the fynbos biome: bluebuck and <b>bontebok.</b> Of these large mammals, only the mountain zebra and leopard survived (by fleeing to the mountains), with the <b>bontebok</b> just surviving near Bredasdorp. All the other species became extinct in the fynbos biome (a tiny relict elephant population still survives {{in the area}} around the Gouritz River and surrounding areas within the fynbos biome area), although many have been introduced into conservation areas from outside the region. The quagga and bluebuck are extinct, although there is a project (the Quagga Project) to restore plains zebras with quagga-like markings.|$|E

5000|$|Wildlife in {{the park}} {{includes}} large antelope such as [...] eland, red hartebeest, <b>bontebok,</b> kudu, gemsbok, steenbok, mountain zebra, duiker and ostriches in the Postberg section. Other smaller animals include the bat-eared fox, caracal, and Cape gray mongoose.|$|E
50|$|Authorities {{agree that}} the hirola belongs in the {{subfamily}} Alcelaphinae within the family Bovidae {{but there has been}} debate about the genus in which it should be placed. The Alcelaphinae contains hartebeest, wildebeest and topi, korrigum, <b>bontebok,</b> blesbok, tiang and tsessebe.|$|E

50|$|Blesbok live in highveld, {{where they}} eat short grasses, while <b>bontebok</b> are {{restricted}} to coastal Fynbos and Renosterveld. They are diurnal, though they rest during {{the heat of the}} day. Herds contain only males, only females, or are mixed, and do not exceed 40 animals for bonteboks or 70 for blesboks.|$|E
50|$|De Hoop is {{haven for}} both {{terrestrial}} and marine animals. Numerous species inhabit these habitats. The reserve has {{a total of}} 86 mammal species. These include the rare <b>bontebok</b> and Cape mountain zebra, eland, grey rhebok, chacma baboon, yellow mongoose and caracal. Leopard, although rare, are {{also found in the}} reserve.|$|E
50|$|However, {{there are}} only about 200 <b>bontebok</b> in the park, as this is the maximum number a park of its size can support without inflicting serious damage to plant life. Over the years the park's surplus stock has been {{translocated}} to other nature reserves and private owners with suitable habitats.|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{its high}} soil fertility, it is {{probable}} that all the herds of large game in the fynbos biome occurred in renosterveld. Thus mountain zebra, quagga, bluebuck, roan antelope, red hartebeest, eland, <b>bontebok,</b> elephant, black rhino and Cape buffalo were common, as were lion, cheetah, African wild dog, spotted hyena and leopard.|$|E

50|$|The African Savanna area {{is located}} near the park entrance. Visitors can observe African lions, flamingos, giraffes, zebras, <b>bontebok,</b> a variety of African birds, black rhinos, and colobus monkeys. the African {{elephant}} crossing contains elephants and meerkats. On July 11, 2007, the Zoo's black rhinoceros, Inge, {{gave birth to a}} female calf named Zuri.|$|E
50|$|Animals {{that can}} be {{observed}} on the savannas include the Ankole-Watusi, <b>bontebok,</b> common eland, zebra, greater kudu, impala, okapi, red river hog, mountain zebra, plains zebra, nyala, reticulated giraffe, roan antelope, sable antelope, Thomson's gazelle, waterbuck, blue wildebeest, Abyssinian ground hornbill, blue crane, Grey crowned crane, greater flamingo, marabou stork, ostrich, pink-backed pelican, spur-winged goose, guineafowl, and Rüppell's vulture.|$|E
50|$|Animals that {{visitors}} will {{see at the}} zoo include DeBrazza's monkey, kestrel, Russell's viper, jaguar, Jamaican fruit bat, Galapagos tortoise, Fly River turtle, <b>bontebok,</b> sulcata tortoise, ruddy duck, Malayan tapir, spectacled owl, Chilean flamingo, toco toucan, saki monkeys, cotton-top tamarin, American alligator, North American river otter, hippopotamus, Bali mynah, clouded leopard, Maasai giraffe, and white rhinoceros.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bontebok</b> {{were once}} {{extensively}} killed as pests, and {{were reduced to}} a wild population of just 17 animals, but the species has since recovered. Blesbok are extinct in their natural habitat, but they have increased in population {{to the point where}} they are now very abundant and avidly farmed, because they are popular quarry for hunters and are easy to sustain.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} fauna, the reserve plays an {{important}} role in conserving two unique and threatened populations of Cape mountain zebra (Equus zebra zebra) and <b>Bontebok</b> (Damaliscus pyrgargus pyrgargus). Populations of leopard (Panthera pardus) are also present in most of the mountainous areas. Threatened invertebrates include seven endemic species of the enigmatic beetle genus Colophon and 14 endemic butterfly species.|$|E
