5|$|David Paul Zorc, a {{linguist}} {{from the}} Australian National University whose expertise is on Philippine languages, notes that Asi speakers {{may have been}} the first Visayan speakers in the Romblon region. He also suggests that Asi may have a Cebuano substratum and that many of its words may have <b>been</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> later influx of other languages such as Romblomanon.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{seemed to}} have {{influenced}} him with certain moral principles, though Gandhi himself had <b>been</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>The</b> Kingdom of God Is Within You, a nonviolent classic written by Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy. In turn, both Gandhi and Martin Luther King had read Tolstoy, and King, Gandhi and Tolstoy had been strongly influenced by Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. King quoted Tolstoy's War and Peace in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} {{of the country was}} also influenced by American cinema, and many of his illustrations were based on cinematic imagery.

5|$|Modern {{proponents of}} social trinitarianism often {{claim to have}} <b>been</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Cappadocians' dynamic picture of the Trinity. However, it would be {{fundamentally}} incorrect to identify Gregory as a social Trinitarian, as his theology emphasises the unity of God's will, and he clearly believes that {{the identities of the}} Trinity are the three persons, not the relations between them.|$|E
5|$|After {{the novel}} was published, it caused {{considerable}} discussion. Religious thinkers, Marxist-Leninists, and anarchists decried the novel for not explaining their ideologies in more detail, but literary figures {{and many in}} the general public praised it; this positive reception may have <b>been</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> nascent government's need to promote literature for nation-building. Atheis was translated into Malay before 1970 and into English in 1972; it was also adapted into a film with the same title in 1974. The novel, which received an award from the Indonesian government in 1969, {{is one of the}} UNESCO Collection of Representative Works.|$|E
5|$|Art {{historian}} Josef Strzygowski, who was {{the first}} European to thoroughly study Armenian architecture, and who placed Armenia in the center of European architecture, suggested that several churches and chapels in Western Europe have <b>been</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cathedrals of Etchmiadzin and Bagaran due to similarities found within their plans. According to Strzygowski, some examples of churches influenced by Etchmiadzin and Bagaran are the 9th-century church of Germigny-des-Prés in France (built by Odo of Metz, probably an Armenian) and San Satiro of Milan, Italy. This view was later supported by Alexander Sahinian and Varazdat Harutyunyan. Sahinian suggested that the Armenian church architecture was spread in Western Europe in the 8th–9th centuries by Paulicians, who migrated from Armenia en mase after being suppressed by the Byzantine government during the Iconoclasm period. Sahinian added many other medieval churches in Europe, such as the Palatine Chapel of Aachen in Germany, to the list of churches to have <b>been</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cathedrals of Etchmiadzin and Bagaran and by Byzantine decorative arts. According to Murad Hasratyan, Etchmiadzin's design was spread to Europe via the Byzantine Empire and served as a model—besides Germigny-des-Prés and San Satiro—for the Nea Ekklesia church in Constantinople and the churches of Mount Athos in Greece.|$|E

5|$|Citizens {{reported}} to Virgil on the Cowboys' movements and their threats {{told him that}} Ike and Tom had left their livery stable and entered town while armed, {{in violation of the}} city ordinance. Virgil Earp was told by several citizens that the McLaurys and the Clantons had gathered on Fremont Street. Virgil decided he had to disarm the Cowboys. His decision to take action may have <b>been</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Cowboy's repeated threats to the Earps, their proximity to Holliday's room in Fly's boarding house, and their location on the route the Earps usually took to their homes two blocks further west on Fremont Street.|$|E
5|$|Dominating the {{appearance}} of the house from the street is a large verandah-style porch, supported by large stone columns, on the southern-facing front of the house; an enclosed porch, smaller but two stories high and supported by wooden pillars, is located on the rear portion of the house's east side. Projecting {{from the front of the}} house, above the porch, is a small wing with a gable, semicircular window, and elaborate cornice. The house is built in a combination of styles; it includes many Italianate details, but its design appears to have <b>been</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> architecture of the Sears Modern Homes.|$|E

5|$|Its {{large size}} {{may have been}} due to climactic factors and the {{abundance}} of large prey items, and it may have also <b>been</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> evolution of regional endothermy (mesothermy) which would have increased its metabolism. However, since the Otodontidae sharks are considered to have been ectotherms, and megalodon was a close relative to them, megalodon may have also been ectothermic. Contrary to this, the largest contemporary ectothermic sharks, such as the whale shark, are filter feeders, implying some metabolic constraints with a predatory lifestyle. That is to say, it is unlikely that megalodon was ectothermic.|$|E
5|$|Karim {{said the}} {{inspiration}} for YouTube first came from Janet Jackson's role in the 2004 Super Bowl incident, when her breast was exposed during her performance, and later from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

5|$|Maritime trade {{along the}} coast of East Africa was {{facilitated}} by trade winds in the Indian Ocean, as well as relatively short distances between land masses. Gedi and other large, contemporary mainland sites often had poor anchorages compared to later sites {{along the coast}}, considering the exposure of their shorelines, availability of sheltered harbors, and water depth upon approach. However, despite reduced access to good anchorage, Gedi and other large mainland sites were able to maintain a high degree of economic success. Their success in trade may have <b>been</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> early establishment of trade routes and available commercial support from their hinterlands.|$|E

5|$|Orders for the A318 {{have been}} {{relatively}} slow, but slightly better than for its direct competitor the Boeing 737–600. At 30 September 2017, Airbus had received 80 orders for this model compared to 69 for the 737-600. The sales pace has <b>been</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> strong sales of the Bombardier CRJ900 and Embraer E-Jets series. The biggest A318 customers at 30 September 2017 were Governments, Executive and Private Jets (20), Air France (18), LATAM Airlines Group (15), GECAS (12) and Frontier Airlines (9).|$|E
5|$|Pearse {{found that}} there was no {{possibility}} of improvement but that Michael Schiavo's decisions might have <b>been</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> potential to inherit what remained of Terri Schiavo's estate as long as he remained married to her. Due to a lack of a living will and questions regarding Michael's credibility, Pearse recommended denying his petition to remove her feeding tube. Pearse reported that the issue of conflict of interest applied to the Schindlers as well since, had Michael divorced Terri as they wanted him to, they would have inherited the remainder of Mrs. Schiavo's estate upon her death.|$|E

5|$|Södermanland {{was granted}} its {{coat of arms}} in 1560.

5|$|The {{album was}} {{reviewed}} positively {{at the time}} of its release and subsequent reviews have remained highly favorable.
