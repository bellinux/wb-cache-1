40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>stain</b> {{is defined}} as dark {{pigmented}} exogenous substance in lines or dots parallel to the gingival margin and firmly adherent to the enamel at the cervical third of the tooth crowns in the primary and permanent dentition. OBJECTIVES: This {{study was conducted to}} assess the prevalence of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> on teeth of Filipino children and to determine a possible association between <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> and caries levels. The study was designed to test the following hypotheses: (i) the prevalence of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> does not differ between children from schools with oral health intervention programs and those from schools without an intervention program, (ii) the prevalence of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> does not differ in children attending easily accessible and remote schools, (iii) caries prevalence and caries experience do not differ in children with and without <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> and (iv) the caries distribution at the surface level does not differ in children with and without <b>black</b> <b>stain.</b> Methods: In total, 32 elementary schools were included. 19 schools with a comprehensive school-based preventive oral health program, seven schools with a basic preventive program and six control schools. All sixth graders of these schools (n= 1748) aged 11. 7 +/- 1. 1 years were clinically examined for <b>black</b> <b>stain.</b> DMFT was assessed in 1121 children by seven calibrated dentists using WHO criteria. DMFS was scored in 627 children by two calibrated dentists. Results: <b>Black</b> <b>stain</b> was found in 16 % of this population. The prevalence of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> did not differ significantly between children attending schools with different oral health intervention programs. Thus, hypothesis 1 was accepted. The prevalence of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in remote than in more accessible schools. Thus, hypothesis 2 was rejected. Children with <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> had significantly lower (P< 0. 05) caries prevalence and caries experience than children without <b>black</b> <b>stain.</b> Thus, hypothesis 3 was rejected. No difference was found in the DMFS pattern of occlusal, smooth and proximal surfaces between children with and without <b>black</b> <b>stain.</b> Thus hypothesis 4 was accepted. Conclusions: The presence of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> is associated with lower levels of caries, but a difference in the distribution of caries in <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> children was not noticed. The interplay between <b>black</b> <b>stain,</b> caries, oral microflora and diet remains unclear and urges further research...|$|R
40|$|<b>Black</b> tooth <b>stain</b> is a {{characteristic}} extrinsic discoloration commonly {{seen on the}} cervical enamel following the contour of the gingiva. To investigate the relationship between <b>black</b> tooth <b>stain</b> and the oral microbiota, we used 16 S rRNA gene sequencing to compare the microbial composition of dental plaque and saliva among caries-free children with and with-out <b>black</b> <b>stain.</b> Dental plaque and saliva, as well as <b>black</b> <b>stain,</b> were sampled from 10 chil-dren with and 15 children without <b>black</b> <b>stain.</b> Data were analyzed using the pipeline tool MOTHUR.

40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>stain</b> is {{characterized}} as a dark line or an incomplete coalescence of dark dots localized on the cervical third of the tooth. Over the last century, the etiology of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> {{has been the subject}} of much debate. Most of the studies concerning this issue were conducted in pediatric population. According to the reviewed articles published between 2001 and 2014, the prevalence of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> varies from 2. 4 % to 18 % with equal sex distribution. The majority of the authors confirm the correlation between the presence of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> and lower caries experience. The microflora of this deposit is dominated by Actinomyces spp. and has lower cariogenic potential than nondiscolored dental plaque. Iron/copper and sulfur complexes are thought to be responsible for the dark color. In patients with <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> saliva has higher calcium concentrations and higher buffering capacity.

40|$|Lascaux Cave in France was {{discovered}} in 1940. Since being opened to visitors the cave has suffered three major microbial outbreaks. The current problem is the fast dissemination of <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> which are threatening the Palaeolithic paintings. Previous data pointed to the involvement of new fungal species {{in the formation of}} <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> on the rock walls and ceiling. However, it appears that there could be other reasons for the formation of different and extensive <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> coating the surface of the clayey sediments. Our analyses reveal that <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> on clayey sediments are mainly produced by Acremonium nepalense, a manganese oxide-depositing fungus, widely distributed in the cave. Thus, in Lascaux Cave, the <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> have a dual origin: on limestone rocks they are mainly produced by the accumulation of fungal melanins, and on clayey sediments by the biogenic deposition of black manganese oxides.

Also, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of dental <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> from a cohort of children born in 2004 in Pelotas, RS, Brazil, evaluating the association with dental caries. For the systematic review, the following electronic databases were accessed: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, LILACS, BBO. No language restriction was used and the combinations of the following keywords were used: prevalence, <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> teeth, <b>black</b> tooth <b>stain,</b> and their equivalents in Portuguese. The search was limited to studies in children and adolescents with deciduous and permanent teeth, and all studies showing prevalence of <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> were included. The selection of studies was done by three reviewers independently. The cross-sectional study included a sample of 1129 five years old children belonging to the Pelotas birth cohort. Children were visited to carry out examination and a questionnaire including questions about demographics conditions, habits and behaviors related to oral health. Clinical examination included assessment of the presence or absence of <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> and presence of caries by DMFT. Logistic regression was used to analyze the data. The prevalence of <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> was 3. 5 % (95 % CI 2. 5 to 4. 7), and the prevalence of caries was 48. 4 % (95 % CI 45. 4 to 51. 4). <b>Black</b> <b>stains</b> and decay were more prevalent in light or dark-skinned black children, in those from mothers with lower level of education and low income level. Adjusted analysis revealed that the presence of <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> was associated with lower levels of dental caries (OR= 0. 51; 95 % CI= 0. 26 - 0. 99; p= 0. 048). Considering the results from the systematic review, 129 papers were found from the search with the keywords, and nine met the established inclusion criteria. The prevalence of <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> found in the studies was 10. 4 % (95 % CI 6. 8 to 14. 1) for permanent teeth, and 4. 0 % (95 % CI 0. 43 to 7. 5) for deciduous teeth.
