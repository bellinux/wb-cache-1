5|$|Gutierrez {{was born}} in Guatemala. His mother {{died when he was}} three. Five years later his father was dead. He left school to work a series of odd jobs to <b>buy</b> <b>food</b> for himself and his sister, Engracia. He learned about the U.S. from an American aid worker at a shelter. Gutierrez decided to head for America by stowing away on freight trains. He got stuck in Mexico for a couple of years, {{crossing}} into California when he was 14. He slept on park benches and got food from a shelter.|$|E
5|$|The {{large numbers}} of poor workers {{migrating}} to the town inevitably resulted in over-crowding and a very low standard of living. When the potato crop failed {{for a second time}} in 1846 the resulting starvation led to a quickly overcrowded workhouse which by the end of 1846 exceeded its 800 capacity. In an attempt to alleviate the problem a relief committee was established in Lurgan as they were in other towns. The relief committees raised money by subscription from local landowners, gentry and members of the clergy and were matched by funds from Dublin. With these monies food was bought and distributed to the ever-increasing numbers of starving people at soup kitchens. In an attempt to provide employment and thereby give the destitute the means to <b>buy</b> <b>food,</b> Lord Lurgan devised a scheme of land- drainage on his estate.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} {{fight with a}} knife {{received}} {{early in the game}} and later with firearms that feature auto-aim. There are also sequences where the player can snipe enemies with a sniper rifle. Enemies do not hide {{due to a lack of}} a cover system. The player can earn money by finishing missions and robbing pedestrians, which can then be used to <b>buy</b> <b>food,</b> weaponry, spray paint, and accessories for the character's home. The mobile game features minigames for robbing pedestrians, stealing, and hijacking vehicles. While robbing, the player taps happy and angry face icons to terrorize the victim into giving more money. When stealing, a Tetris clone lets the player fit more items into the truck, and the carjacking minigame lets the player earn more money for scaring the captive passenger by driving at high speeds.|$|E

5|$|Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was {{composed}} of six constituent republics: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. In 1991, Croatia, and Slovenia seceded from Yugoslavia. Bosnia-Herzegovina—a republic with a mixed population consisting of Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats—followed suit in March 1992 in a highly controversial referendum, creating tension in the ethnic communities. Bosnian Serb militias, whose strategic goal was to secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina and unite with Serbia, encircled Sarajevo with a siege force of 18,000 stationed in the surrounding hills, from which they assaulted the city with weapons that included artillery, mortars, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, heavy machine-guns, rocket launchers, and aircraft bombs. From 2May 1992 {{until the end of}} the war in 1996, the city was blockaded. The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, numbering roughly 40,000 inside the besieged city, was poorly equipped and unable to break the siege. Meanwhile, throughout the country, thousands of predominantly Bosniak civilians were driven from their homes in a process of ethnic cleansing. In Sarajevo, women and children attempting to <b>buy</b> <b>food</b> were frequently terrorized by Bosnian Serb sniper fire.|$|E
5|$|The British {{response}} to the bombing came on 30July, when the division carried out Operation Shark. Believing that the bombers were being sheltered in Tel Aviv, every dwelling and building was searched {{for members of the}} Lehi and Irgun, and the population questioned. During the operation, a cordon surrounded the city and a curfew was imposed on its inhabitants. To allow the population to <b>buy</b> <b>food</b> and other essentials, the curfew was lifted for two hours every second day, {{until the end of the}} operation. The division's three parachute brigades were each given one quarter of the city to cordon and search while the fourth quarter was the responsibility of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, attached to the division for the operation. Over four days each brigade questioned around 100,000 people, and 787 were detained for further questioning. During the searches, five arms dumps were found, containing four machine guns, twenty-three mortars, 176 rifles and pistols, and 127,000 round of ammunition. Also found were £50,000 of forged bearer bonds, forging equipment and a large amount of explosives.|$|E

25|$|The war devastated {{not only}} soldiers. By {{the end of}} 1915, there were {{manifold}} signs that the economy was breaking down under the heightened strain of wartime demand. The main problems were food shortages and rising prices. Inflation dragged incomes down at an alarmingly rapid rate, and shortages {{made it difficult to}} buy even what one could afford. These shortages were a problem especially in the capital, St. Petersburg, where distance from supplies and poor transportation networks made matters particularly bad. Shops closed early or entirely for lack of bread, sugar, meat and other provisions, and lines lengthened massively for what remained. It became increasingly difficult both to afford and actually <b>buy</b> <b>food.</b>|$|E

Rabbi Wasserman made an impression on many young Jews that he met while in the United States. Rabbi Wasserman returned to Poland although he knew his life was in danger by returning. This was partly because he did not want to abandon his students, and partly because he took a dim view of American Jewry. In 1939, just before the Nazi invasion, he even forbade his students from accepting visas to the United States to study at Yeshiva University and what is now the Hebrew Theological College due to what he perceived as a spiritually dangerous atmosphere in these two institutions.|$|E
