40|$|ABSTRACT On-chip thermal {{monitoring}} {{is becoming}} increasingly important as VLSI circuits becoming more complex. On-chip thermal monitors provide critical input to the power and thermal management structures {{that are necessary to}} prevent excessive chip temperatures from destroying the device or reducing the expected lifetime to unacceptable levels. In applications where on-chip heating is of concern, multiple <b>built-in</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> are distributed throughout the chip to monitor temperature at critical positions on the die. These on-chip <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> must be compatible with submicron processes, must not consume a large area, and must be highly accurate with low power consumption over standard process variations and over typical supply voltage variations. One contribution of this work is the introduction of a threshold-voltage-based <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor.</b> It is based upon a self-stabilized feedback architecture. This circuit expresses temperature information as an output voltage. An analysis of this circuit using a standard square-law model for the transistors with zero output conductance shows this structure is power supply independent with an output voltage that is linearly dependent upon the threshold voltage. A more detailed analysis of both the VDD rejection and the output voltage linearity that includes the effect of the transistors output transconductance in the square-law model is also presented. Although the performance is still quite good, strategies to improve both linearity and VDD sensitivity are presented. Two implementations of this <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> were fabricated, one in a TSMC 0. 18 Âµm process and the other in an ONC 0. 18 Âµm process. Both simulation results and experimental results of the two circuits show similar performance. The circuit in the TSMC 0. 18 Âµm process consumes only 0. 92 μW of power with a 1 % duty cycle and requires an extremely small area of 15 μmÃ? 24 μm. Nine chips from two process runs with batch slope/curvature correction show a maximum INL error of 0. 05 C over the temperature range [60 C, 90 C]. This accuracy is well beyond what is needed for power/thermal management circuitry to achieve target reliability goals in multi-core systems. Another contribution of this work is the introduction of a new temperature to digital converter (TmDC) that does not require a reference generator, an interface circuit, or an ADC. This TmDC has low supply sensitivity, small die area, and low power consumption. A prototype circuit designed to support power management applications over the [60 C, 90 C] temperature range was implemented in a 0. 13 um CMOS process with a 1. 2 V power supply. It can be used as either a temperature trigger or a digital thermometer. The total silicon area for the TmDC is only. 0025 mm 2.

30|$|One of {{the major}} {{bottlenecks}} of fast development in the modern electronics industry is heat. Managing the high heat flux generated by billions of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) is the main challenge. A scalable, <b>built-in,</b> and agile <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> which can provide real-time thermal history of an IC chip is essential to thermal failure analysis [1]. However, thermal measurement at microscale and nanoscale is a technical challenge. When both high spatial resolution and high temperature sensitivity are required, only a few approaches, such as scanning thermal microscopy [2], luminescent nanoparticles, and infrared thermography [3 – 5], remain {{in the list of}} suitable candidates. If built-in thermal sensors are required for time-resolvable solutions in a solid device, such as in IC chips, micro-electro-mechanical system, a lab-on-a-chip, or a flexible printed circuits, then it seems that only stripe-shaped resistive sensor [6] and thin-film thermocouple (TFTC) are left in the candidate list. The passive nature of a thermocouple makes it superior to a resistive thermal sensor (usually made of metal or semiconductors) because a thermocouple provides a far more rapid response, does not require external excitation voltage or current, and generates no additional heat which may cause unexpected electrical noise and error in temperature measurement.|$|R

It generates a peak power of 234 μW for that difference. In addition, the voltage difference obtained of 35. 5 mV exceeds the minimum voltage required by the power management subsystem to be used. The power management sub-system consists of an ultra-low power converter that provides an output voltage of 4. 1 V and a measured power efficiency of 32 % Moreover, thanks to the management of the Bluetooth sleeping modes, with the built-in controller and several operational amplifier comparators, an average power consumption of 5 μW is required during operation.

The analysis of various kind of structure geometries confirm that the most accurate and stable structure of the flexible <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> is the comb electrode structure. In the examined research as a thermo-sensitive material the poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) filled with different concentration of MWCNT was used. The comb <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> model for electrical analysis has been considered in the COMSOL Multiphysics® 4. 4 environment...|$|R
