5|$|Although much of {{his life}} remains obscure, Nerva was {{considered}} a wise and moderate emperor <b>by</b> <b>ancient</b> historians. Nerva's greatest success was his ability to ensure a peaceful transition of power after his death by selecting Trajan as his heir, thus founding the Nerva–Antonine dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Builders took {{advantage}} of available geological features when constructing the tombs. Some tombs were quarried out of existing limestone clefts, others behind slopes of scree, or were {{at the edge of}} rock spurs created <b>by</b> <b>ancient</b> flood channels.|$|E
5|$|Chisholm's Neoclassical Period {{refers to}} several of his works which were {{inspired}} <b>by</b> <b>ancient</b> and obscure motifs from the pre-Classical era. His Sonatina no. 3, evidently based on several ricercare motifs originally written by Dalza, fuses Brittenesque harmonies and gentle dissonances in quintessentially pianistic textures.|$|E

5000|$|Kapnobatai, meaning [...] "those {{who walk}} on/in smoke/clouds", were ancient shamans and {{descendants}} of the Scythians {{as well as the}} Thracians and Dacians who burned cannabis flowers to induce a state of trance. It is believed that as cannabis slowly spread westward, these peoples were introduced to it <b>by</b> the <b>ancient</b> Aryans, of whom in turn were introduced to it <b>by</b> the <b>ancient</b> Assyrians, and them <b>by</b> the <b>ancient</b> Hindus. These past cultures were some of the very first to smoke cannabis for recreational and spiritual purposes.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{the town}} is officially named Behramkale (...) , most people still call it <b>by</b> its <b>ancient</b> name of Assos. The town is on the {{southern}} side of Biga Peninsula, better known <b>by</b> its <b>ancient</b> name, Troad. Assos {{is located on the}} coast of the Adramyttian Gulf (Turkish: Edremit Körfezi).|$|R
5|$|In his {{usage of}} grisaille, van der Weyden distinguishes between the earthly realm {{of flesh and}} blood, and the divine, {{represented}} <b>by</b> <b>ancient</b> sculptural figures, who appear frozen in time. Art historian Shirley Blum believes these figures were relegated to the architectural elements {{so as not to}} crowd the central devotional image.|$|E
5|$|The {{concepts}} of angle and radius were already used <b>by</b> <b>ancient</b> {{peoples of the}} first millennium BC. The Greek astronomer and astrologer Hipparchus (190–120 BC) created a table of chord functions giving {{the length of the}} chord for each angle, and there are references to his using polar coordinates in establishing stellar positions.|$|E
5|$|According to Plutarch, Alcibiades {{had several}} famous teachers, {{including}} Socrates, and was well {{trained in the}} art of Rhetoric. He was noted, however, for his unruly behavior, which was mentioned <b>by</b> <b>ancient</b> Greek and Latin writers on several occasions. It was believed that Socrates took Alcibiades as a student because he believed he could change Alcibiades from his vain ways. Xenophon attempted to clear Socrates' name at trial by relaying information that Alcibiades was always corrupt and that Socrates merely failed in attempting to teach him morality.|$|E

It is believed that the area was inhabited <b>by</b> <b>Ancient</b> Britons, and that the Brigantes gave the River Beal its name. An ancient track, perhaps of Roman origin, crosses the modern Buckstones Road leading to Castleshaw Roman fort in neighbouring Saddleworth.|$|E
5|$|Awarded a {{scholarship}} to Oxford, Williams read Greats (pure Classics followed <b>by</b> <b>Ancient</b> History and philosophy) at Balliol. Among his influences at Oxford were WS Watt, R Meiggs, RM Hare, Elizabeth Anscombe, Eric Dodds, Eduard Fraenkel, David Pears and Gilbert Ryle. He shone {{in the first part}} of the course, the pure classics (being particularly fond of writing Latin verses in the style of Ovid) and graduated in 1951 with a congratulatory first in the second part of the course and a prize fellowship at All Souls.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus and Tiberius {{are often}} contrasted <b>by</b> <b>ancient</b> historians, poets who wrote using themes found in drama, with Germanicus playing the tragic hero and Tiberius the tyrant. The {{endurance}} of the Principate is challenged in these narratives, by the emperor's jealous trepidation toward competent commanders such as Germanicus. Attention is paid particularly to their leadership styles, i.e., {{in their relationship}} with the masses. Germanicus is painted as a competent leader able to handle the masses whereas Tiberius is indecisive and envious.|$|E

5|$|Halotus died {{close to}} the end of the century, his public {{reputation}} somewhat restored after his rise in stature and wealth. His date of death is not mentioned <b>by</b> <b>ancient</b> historians of the time, such as Tacitus or Suetonius, who were also some of the main recorders of the events around Claudius' death and the political trauma that followed. Whether Halotus was involved in the murder of Claudius and to what extent remains an unresolved point, as do many other aspects related to Claudius' passing.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{migration}} {{has been}} recorded as much as 3,000 years ago <b>by</b> <b>Ancient</b> Greek authors including Homer and Aristotle, and in the Book of Job, for species such as storks, turtle doves, and swallows. More recently, Johannes Leche began recording dates of arrivals of spring migrants in Finland in 1749, and scientific studies have used techniques including bird ringing and satellite tracking. Threats to migratory birds have grown with habitat destruction especially of stopover and wintering sites, as well as structures such as power lines and wind farms.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{classical}} planets, Uranus is {{visible to the}} naked eye, but it was never recognised as a planet <b>by</b> <b>ancient</b> observers because of its dimness and slow orbit. Sir William Herschel announced its discovery on 13 March 1781, expanding the known boundaries of the Solar System {{for the first time in}} history and making Uranus the first planet discovered with a telescope.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of iridium is intertwined {{with that of}} platinum and the other metals of the platinum group. Native platinum used <b>by</b> <b>ancient</b> Ethiopians and by South American cultures always contained {{a small amount of}} the other platinum group metals, including iridium. Platinum reached Europe as platina ("silverette"), found in the 17th century by the Spanish conquerors in a region today known as the department of Chocó in Colombia. The discovery that this metal was not an alloy of known elements, but instead a distinct new element, did not occur until 1748.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} scientific {{models of}} the Universe were developed <b>by</b> <b>ancient</b> Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at {{the centre of the}} Universe. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the centre of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation, Sir Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as observations by Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of Mars as a wandering {{object in the}} night sky was recorded <b>by</b> <b>ancient</b> Egyptian astronomers. By the 2nd millennium BCE they were familiar with the apparent retrograde motion of the planet, in which it appears to move in the opposite direction across the sky from its normal progression. Mars was portrayed on the ceiling of the tomb of Seti I, on the Ramesseum ceiling, and in the Senenmut star map. The last is the oldest known star map, being dated to 1534 BCE based on the position of the planets.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} that the Hawaiian islands became older as one moved to the northwest was suspected <b>by</b> <b>ancient</b> Hawaiians long before Europeans arrived. During their voyages, seafaring Hawaiians noticed differences in erosion, soil formation, and vegetation, allowing them to deduce that the islands to the northwest (Niihau and Kauai) were older than those to the southeast (Maui and Hawaii). The idea was handed down the generations through the legend of Pele, the fiery Hawaiian Goddess of Volcanoes.|$|E
5|$|These {{numbers are}} (<b>by</b> <b>ancient</b> standards) consistent, {{and this could}} be {{interpreted}} that a number around 1,200 is correct. Among modern scholars some have accepted this number, although suggesting that the number must have been lower by the Battle of Salamis. Other recent works on the Persian Wars reject this number1,207 being seen {{as more of a}} reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliadand generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.|$|E
