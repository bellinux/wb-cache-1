40|$|In Jewish tradition, the <b>book</b> <b>as</b> an &ldquo;exemplary&rdquo;, the <b>book</b> <b>as</b> an &ldquo;object&rdquo; is {{associated}} with an attitude of veneration as expressed by Pierre Chaunu in &ldquo;livre en majeste&rdquo; &ndash; the book in its majesty when referring to the Holy Bible. The content {{of the book is}} revealed by its own referentiality enclosed in its text and by its unfolding through reading. On the other hand, {{the title of the book}} may suggest the plenitude of its text, a semantic sublimation, an essentialization of the content of the book. This is rendered by means of the metaphor, for metaphor implies a &ldquo;translation&rdquo; of significance and senses within syntagmas and word associations that exceed the referential meaning. Therefore, several metaphorical categories may be discerned in the Hebrew book titles. A first category would concentrate symbolic, spectacular, luminiferous values in which light is the main attribute of the book, an attribute made up by superposing the light and the celestial, both defining the Divine: the <b>BOOK</b> <b>as</b> LIGHT. A second category of metaphoric phrasing would incorporate ethical &ndash; theological values. The metaphor <b>BOOK</b> <b>as</b> GATE codifies the idea of accessing, of entering in a livresque, bookish universe open to interpretation. The <b>BOOK</b> <b>as</b> PURITY and GRACE, the <b>BOOK</b> <b>as</b> BRIDE, the <b>BOOK</b> <b>as</b> CITADEL, the <b>BOOK</b> <b>as</b> THERAPY, the healing book would enter the same category. The metaphoric repertoire reaches its climax with the <b>BOOK</b> <b>as</b> HOLINESS, a syntagma that induces the semantics of writing as a sacred task. Other significant metaphors included in the Hebrew book titles are: the <b>BOOK</b> <b>as</b> ADORNEMENT, the <b>BOOK</b> <b>as</b> SPLENDOR, etc...|$|R

Students developed  185 metaphors.

5|$|All {{seven of}} Angelou's {{installments}} {{of her life}} story are {{in the tradition of}} African-American autobiography. Starting with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou challenges the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Angelou said in 1989 that she is the only serious writer to choose autobiography to express herself, but she reports not one person's story, but the collective's. Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe writes that Angelou is representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people. Her use of devices common in fictional writing, such as dialog, characterization and thematic development, has led some reviewers to categorize her <b>books</b> <b>as</b> autobiographical fiction.|$|E
5|$|Antoine Gardano {{became the}} primary Italian {{publisher}} for Arcadelt, although the competing Venetian publishing house of Scotto brought {{out one of}} his madrigal <b>books</b> <b>as</b> well. Arcadelt's Il bianco e dolce cigno opened one of Gardano's books; as the piece had already achieved immense fame, it was the main selling point. In Paris, some of Arcadelt's chansons appeared as early as 1540 in the publications of Pierre Attaingnant and Jacques Moderne, so must have been written in Italy. After Arcadelt returned to France, his chansons, masses, and motets appeared in the editions of the printing firm of Le Roy and Ballard throughout the 1550s and 1560s, while his music was still being printed in distant Venice.|$|E
5|$|As the Stranger {{continues}} {{to explore the}} island, books linking to more Ages are discovered hidden behind complex mechanisms and puzzles. The Stranger must visit each Age, find the red and blue pages hidden there, and return to Myst Island. These pages can then {{be placed in the}} corresponding <b>books.</b> <b>As</b> the Stranger adds more pages to these books, the brothers can be seen and heard more clearly. After collecting four pages, the brothers can talk clearly enough to tell the Stranger where the fifth and final missing page for their book is hidden; if the Stranger can complete either book, that brother will be set free. The clearer dialog also allows the player to more accurately judge each brother's personality. The Stranger is left with a choice to help Sirrus, Achenar, or neither.|$|E
