25|$|The 25th Arkansas Infantry was {{designated}} as the 30th Arkansas Infantry {{for a period of}} about six months in the winter of 1862-1863, until after the battle of Murfreesboro. While serving as the 30th Arkansas Infantry its colors were captured by the 2nd Ohio Infantry at the Battle of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, on December 31, 1862. The flag was returned to the State of Arkansas by the U.S. War Department in 1905. The flag measures 40inches on the staff by 46inches on the fly. It is composed of a <b>blue</b> <b>cotton</b> field, bordered on all sides with white cotton, 3inches wide, with a white St. Andrew's cross traversing the blue field. In black painted outline figures, 2-1/2inches high, is the designation 30TH REG, ARK INF on the upper and lower borders, respectively. Two battle honors—FARMINGTON MISS and RICHMOND KY—appear in white painted outline letters, in the upper and lower quadrants, respectively, formed by the white cross. The flag is presently housed {{in the collection of the}} Old State House Museum in Little Rock, Arkansas.|$|E

Upon the addition of lactophenol <b>cotton</b> <b>blue,</b> fungi stain blue allowing for easier visualization and examination.

2500|$|In {{the early}} hours of 15 August, just as the Foreign Legations were being relieved, Empress Dowager Cixi, dressed in the padded <b>blue</b> <b>cotton</b> of a farm woman, the Guangxu Emperor, and a small retinue climbed into three wooden ox carts and escaped from the city covered with rough blankets. Legend has it that the Empress Dowager then either ordered that the Guangxu Emperor's {{favourite}} concubine, Consort Zhen, be thrown down a well in the Forbidden City or tricked her into drowning herself. The journey was made all the more arduous by the lack of preparation, but the Empress Dowager insisted this was not a retreat, rather a [...] "tour of inspection." [...] After weeks of travel, the party arrived in Xi'an in Shaanxi province, beyond protective mountain passes where the foreigners could not reach, deep in Chinese Muslim territory and protected by the Gansu Braves.

2500|$|Argentina beat Uruguay 10 in {{the round}} of 16 wearing <b>blue</b> <b>cotton</b> shirts that coach Carlos Bilardo {{believed}} would prove too uncomfortable in the searing Mexico City heat. [...] Bilardo asked Argentina’s kit manufacturer {{to come up with}} lighter blue shirts for the quarterfinal, an impossible request given the short deadline. [...] With just three days to go before the match, he sent out Ruben Moschella, a member of his coaching staff, to scour the shops of the Mexican capital for a suitable kit. He returned with two different blue shirts, which they subsequently weighed but were unable to choose between. It was then that Diego Maradona appeared and said: “That’s a nice jersey. We’ll beat England in that.” [...] Moschella returned to the shop and bought 38 of the shirts for the side to wear in the showdown versus England. A designer fashioned some makeshift Argentine Football Association (AFA) badges, which were then sewn on to each jersey, with silvery American Football shirt numbers hurriedly ironed on to the backs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Lyophyllum P. Karst (1881) is {{characterized}} by siderophilous basidia and spore becoming <b>blue</b> in <b>cotton</b> <b>blue</b> solution, which was divided into three divided sections (Lyophyllum, Difformia, and Tephrophana) by Singer in 1986 based on color variations of gills bruised and habitat. To 2012, two hundred and thirty-nine taxa were recorded in Indexfungorum. org; nineteen taxa were reported in this genus in China. Most species of the genus Lyophyllum are very important delicious edible and medicinal fungi. For example, L. decastes and L. semitale have anti-cancer effect. In this paper, the authors dwell on some taxonomic questions of the genus Lyophyllum: (1) the characters of classification, including siderophilous granulation in the basidia and spores becoming <b>blue</b> in <b>cotton</b> <b>blue</b> solution, are not unique; (2) a few species that their specific taxonomic position is still unclear, furthermore, phenomenon of synonym and homonym is presented commonly; (3) the Lyophyllum is not monophyletic group. Finally, the authors put forward a natural taxonomic system need be continually studied and generated using a conjoint methods of morphological and molecular...|$|R

An [...] anchor, USS Constitution, and eagle (ACE) emblem is embroidered on the left breast pocket on all Type I NWUs. Accessories include a navy <b>blue</b> <b>cotton</b> T-shirt, an eight-point utility cover, and a web belt with closed buckle. The uniform is worn with rank insignia on both collar points and on the front panel of the utility cover, with sew-on name and [...] "U.S. NAVY" [...] tapes, also on the new digital background pattern, having gold-colored lettering for officers, CPOs and midshipmen.

40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} applied to characterize fiber dyes and determine the discriminating ability of the method. Black, blue, and red acrylic, cotton, and wool samples were analyzed. Four excitation sources were used to obtain complementary responses in the case of fluorescent samples. Fibers that did not provide informative spectra using a given laser were usually detected using another wavelength. For any colored acrylic, the 633 -nm laser did not provide Raman information. The 514 -nm laser provided the highest discrimination for <b>blue</b> and black <b>cotton,</b> but half of the <b>blue</b> <b>cottons</b> produced noninformative spectra. The 830 -nm laser exhibited the highest discrimination for red cotton. Both visible lasers provided the highest discrimination for black and blue wool, and NIR lasers produced remarkable separation for red and black wool.
