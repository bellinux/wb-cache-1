5|$|Many {{thermoplastics}} {{can also}} be welded using chemical solvents. When placed {{in contact with the}} plastic, the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the solvent can permeate the plastic, the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS (acrylonitrile <b>butadiene</b> styrene) pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and polystyrene plastics in the construction of models. Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition, but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition.|$|E

Vinylcyclohexene is a common impurity found in <b>butadiene</b> upon storage due to dimerization. Cyclooctadiene and cyclododecatriene are produced via nickel- or titanium-catalyzed dimerization and trimerization reactions, respectively. <b>Butadiene</b> is also useful in the synthesis of cycloalkanes and cycloalkenes, as it reacts with double and triple carbon-carbon bonds through the Diels-Alder reaction.|$|E
40|$|A new {{route to}} five fluorine-containing <b>butadienes</b> The {{synthesis}} of five fluorine-substituted <b>butadienes</b> known since the 1950 s (two to six fluorine atoms) {{could be achieved}} via palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions. Stille- and Negishi-coupling were used, in Stille-reactions the catalyst systems were optimized. The majority of those new syntheses constitutes an improvement of yield over older routes. Novel Manganese complexes of fluorinated <b>butadienes</b> Two groups of new manganese complexes were prepared: the carbonyl- and cyclopentadienyl-substituted eta- 4 -complexes of the <b>butadienes</b> mentioned above and novel oxo-bridged bimetallic manganese complexes of hexafluorobutadiene with manganese in the oxidation state +IV (unusual in organometallic compounds). Metal complexes of partly fluorinated <b>butadienes</b> had not been described in literature so far. The influence of fluorine substitution on the ligand behaviour of the <b>butadienes</b> was studied on these complexes. The new compounds were characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic methods.

The first tetrafluorobutatriene complexes prepared directly from the free triene Two stable transition metal complexes were prepared directly from 1, 1, 4, 4 -tetrafluorobutatriene, an extremely unstable compound.

25|$|In the United States, western Europe, and Japan, <b>butadiene</b> is {{produced}} as {{a byproduct of}} the steam cracking process used to produce ethylene and other olefins. When mixed with steam and briefly heated to very high temperatures (often over 900°C), aliphatic hydrocarbons give up hydrogen to produce a complex mixture of unsaturated hydrocarbons, including <b>butadiene.</b> The quantity of <b>butadiene</b> produced depends on the hydrocarbons used as feed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{development}} of new palladium and copper- mediated reactions for functionalization of alkenes and propargylic alcohol derivatives. The synthetic utility of the 1, 2 -diborylated <b>butadienes</b> synthesized in one of these processes has also been demonstrated. We have developed an efficient procedure for the synthesis of allenyl boronates from propargylic carbonates and acetates. This was achieved by using a bimetallic system of palladium and copper or silver as co-catalyst. The reactions were performed under mild conditions for the synthesis of a variety of allenyl boronates. Furthermore, the synthesis of 1, 2 -diborylated <b>butadienes</b> was achieved with high diastereoselectivity from propargylic epoxides. The reactivity of the 1, 2 -diborylated <b>butadienes</b> with aldehydes was studied. It was found that the initial allylboration reaction proceeds via an allenylboronate intermediate. The allenylboronate reacts readily with an additional aldehyde to construct 2 -ethynylbutane- 1, 4 -diols with moderate to high diastereoselectivity. We have also studied the copper-mediated trifluoromethylation of propargylic halides and trifluoroacetates. It was also shown that a transfer of chirality occurred when an enantioenriched starting material was used. In {{the last part of the}} thesis, we have described a method for palladium-catalyzed functionalization of allylic C-H bonds for the selective synthesis of allylic silanes. The protocol only works under highly oxidative conditions which suggest a mechanism involving high oxidation state palladium intermediates.

25|$|Storage of <b>butadiene</b> as a compressed, liquified gas {{carries a}} {{specific}} and unusual hazard.

Inhibitors are typically added to reduce this hazard, but <b>butadiene</b> cylinders should still be considered short-shelf life items.
