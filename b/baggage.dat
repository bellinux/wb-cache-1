5|$|Operationally, {{the design}} of the cargo holds led to {{considerable}} difficulty for the ground crew, especially <b>baggage</b> handlers at the airports. The cargo hold had its doors located directly underneath the aircraft, so each item of <b>baggage</b> or cargo had to be loaded vertically upwards {{from the top of the}} <b>baggage</b> truck, then slid along the hold floor to be stacked inside. The individual pieces of luggage and cargo also had to be retrieved in a similarly slow manner at the arriving airport.|$|E
5|$|The <b>baggage</b> camel {{should be}} robust and heavy. Studies have {{recommended}} the camel should have either a small {{or a large}} head with a narrow aquiline nose, prominent eyes and large lips. The neck should be medium to long so the head is held high. The chest should be deep and the hump should be well-developed with sufficient space behind it to accommodate the saddle. The hindlegs should be heavy, muscular and sturdy. The dromedary can be trained to carry <b>baggage</b> {{from the age of}} five years, but must not be given heavy loads before the age of six. The hawia is a typical <b>baggage</b> saddle from Sudan. The methods of training the <b>baggage</b> camels are similar to those for riding camels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Baggage</b> is an American dating {{game show}} hosted by Jerry Springer and {{broadcast}} by Game Show Network. The original series premiered on April 19, 2010, airing for four seasons. A spin-off series, entitled <b>Baggage</b> on the Road, aired for one season, which debuted January 7, 2015. The show has earned high ratings by GSN's standards; despite this, {{it has also}} received mixed critical reception.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{featured}} in <b>Baggage</b> Claim (film) movie in 2013. In 2014, {{the song was}} covered on the television series Rising Star by contestant Alice Lee.|$|E
5|$|Once {{south of}} the river, Asad, believing himself to be safe from pursuit, ordered his men to set up camp and sent orders to Ibrahim to halt the <b>baggage</b> train and {{likewise}} set up camp. The Turgesh khaghan, after consulting the local rulers, followed {{the advice of the}} ruler of al-Ishtikhan and led his army to cross the river en masse. Faced with a full-scale charge of the Turgesh and their allies' cavalry, the Arabs withdrew to their camp. The Turgesh attacked the camp but were turned back after a fight in which, according to al-Tabari, the Arabs' servants put on pack-saddle cloths as armour and used the tent-poles to strike at the riders' faces.During the night the Turgesh departed, and rode south to overtake the Arab <b>baggage</b> train. Ibrahim ibn Asim had dug a trench around his encampment and his troops managed to beat off the first attacks by the khaghans Sogdian allies. Then the khagan, after climbing a hill and scouting out the dispositions of the <b>baggage</b> escort, dispatched a portion of his men to attack the camp from behind, focusing on the allied Iranian troops from Saghaniyan, {{while the rest of the}} army attacked the Muslims from the front. The Turgesh attack almost annihilated the defenders: the greater part of the troops of Saghaniyan, along with their king, the Saghan Khudah, fell, and the Turgesh seized most of the <b>baggage</b> train. Only the timely arrival of Asad with the main Arab army saved the remnant of the <b>baggage</b> train escort from destruction. According to the account of al-Tabari, the Turgesh launched another unsuccessful attack on Asad's camp the following day, 1 October 737, and then departed.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} wreck, {{when the rain}} had subsided, Captain Holland sent members of the Rifle Corps and the York and Lancaster Regiment to {{retrieve}} some <b>baggage</b> from the ship, which was stuck on the rocks and had not sunk. The operation was called off at 10:00, when First Lieutenant St. John decided that the wreck was too dangerous. The <b>baggage</b> that had been recovered was taken to shore.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} by first {{introducing}} the central character. Three contestants are then introduced, each accompanied by three pieces of baggage: a small one, a medium one, and a large one, with each one containing a corresponding secret. The central contestant also has a piece of <b>baggage</b> {{of his or her}} own, which is only revealed {{at the end of the}} show. During the show, three possible secrets about the central contestant are given, one of which is the actual secret contained in their <b>baggage.</b> These secrets can include bad habits, strange relationship preferences, issues with one's past, or strange hobbies. After the three other contestants are introduced, they each open the smallest piece of <b>baggage,</b> and explain the secrets they contain.|$|E
5|$|The two {{contestant}}s {{then open}} their largest pieces of <b>baggage</b> and reveal the secrets they contain. Each contestant makes one final statement, {{and the main}} contestant eliminates a second contestant. The main contestant's own <b>baggage</b> is then opened and the contents revealed to the remaining contestant. If the contestant accepts the secret belonging to the central character, the couple is given an expense-covered evening together. However, if the contestant can not accept the secret, the pair part ways.|$|E
5|$|A$330million {{expansion}} programme for Terminal 2 {{was announced}} in 2007 and was completed in 2012. The objectives of this project include new lounges and retail facilities, a new satellite terminal, increased luggage capacity and a redesign of customs and security areas. A new satellite terminal features floor-to-ceiling windows offers views of the North-South runway. The new concourse includes three double-decker aerobridges which are gates 16, 18 and 20, each accommodating an A380 aircraft or two smaller aircraft and one single aerobridge. The <b>baggage</b> handling capacity will be increased, and two new <b>baggage</b> carousels will cater to increased A380 traffic. Work commenced in November 2007 and will be completed in 2011 but was opened in 2012.|$|E

5|$|International {{airports}} have {{commercial relationships}} with and {{provide services to}} airlines and passengers from around the world. Many also serve as hubs, or places where non-direct flights may land and passengers may switch planes, while others serve primarily direct point-to-point flights. This affects airport design factors, including the number and placement of terminals {{as well as the}} flow of passengers and <b>baggage</b> between different areas of the airport. An airport specializing in point-to-point transit can have international and domestic terminals, each in their separate building equipped with separate <b>baggage</b> handling facilities. In a hub airport, however, spaces and services are shared.|$|E
5|$|Passengers {{gathered}} in the third class common room where they could play chess or cards, or walk along the poop deck. Third class children played in the common room or explored the ship—nine-year-old Frank Goldsmith recalled peering into the engine room and climbing up the <b>baggage</b> cranes on the poop deck.|$|E
5|$|The {{computer}} game Snuffle The Truffles {{was replaced with}} a parrot themed game Loot The Fruit and Mr Blobby joined the show and was given his own game called Blobby's <b>Baggage</b> which involved viewers having to guess where Blobby had been on holiday.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{ordered that}} the excess <b>baggage</b> {{be taken to}} Burlington where it could be sent to Pennsylvania. The ground had frozen, making it {{possible}} to move the artillery without it sinking into the ground. By midnight, the plan was complete, with the <b>baggage</b> on its way to Burlington and the guns wrapped in heavy cloth to stifle noise and prevent the British from learning of the evacuation. Washington left 500 men behind with two cannon to patrol, keep the fires burning, and to work with picks and shovels to make the British think that they were digging in. Before dawn, these men were to join up with the main army.|$|E
5|$|After the September 11, 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks, government {{scrutiny of}} train and airplane passengers substantially increased, but bus passengers are largely free of it. <b>Baggage</b> is seldom inspected, and cash customers {{do not require}} identification. Greyhound says that security wands have been deployed on buses, {{but they do not}} appear to be routinely used.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} army, Anitha employs {{a group of}} porters headed by Muthu, to {{transport}} the <b>baggage</b> during the journey. The crew embark on their voyage leading them to an island, Min-gua, near Vietnam. The island borders 3 countries: Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. They face seven traps set by the Cholas: sea creatures, cannibals, warriors, snakes, hunger, quicksand and a village. Many porters and army men are killed by these traps.|$|E

Greyhound and Peter Pan Bus (which no longer serves New London) previously used the former <b>baggage</b> and express office.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also said}} that on the {{southern}} side of the track stood cliffs that overlooked the pass. However, a glance at any photograph of the pass shows there are no cliffs, only steep slopes covered in thorny bushes and trees. Although no obstacle to individuals, such terrain would not be passable by an army and its <b>baggage</b> train.|$|E
5|$|It was {{too dark}} to see anything, so we carried our tent and <b>baggage</b> near the only house on the island, and began to cook our suppers, in order to be {{prepared}} for the earliest dawn, and to enjoy that which, from the conversation of the gentlemen we had, now raised the highest expectations of.|$|E

5|$|On campaign, {{following}} {{the assembly of}} the various squadrons at fortified bases (aplēkta) along the coast, the fleet consisted of the main body, composed of the oared warships, and the <b>baggage</b> train (touldon) of sailing vessels and oared transports, which would be sent away {{in the event of}} battle. The battle fleet was divided into squadrons, and orders were transmitted from ship to ship through signal flags (kamelaukia) and lanterns.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} anniversary of the train's famous dash, the {{original}} Zephyr was rechristened the Pioneer Zephyr to distinguish it as the first of the Burlington's growing Zephyr fleet. In 1938, car 525 was replaced by car number 500, a 40-seat buffet/lounge car, to provide light meals. Car number 505, the baggage-coach combine, was rebuilt at this time into a full <b>baggage</b> car, but it kept its original windows.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} from Jacksonville International Airport, Florida, several hours before the accident, although the departure from Jacksonville was delayed by poor weather over New York {{and the removal of}} the <b>baggage</b> of a passenger who decided not to board the jet. The instrument approach landing was uneventful and the jet was not significantly delayed while in the air waiting to land, however congestion on the taxiways at LaGuardia delayed the arrival of the aircraft at the gate.|$|E
5|$|The current {{trend of}} {{enhancing}} {{security at the}} cost of passenger and <b>baggage</b> handling efficiency at international airports is expected to continue in the future. This places financial burden on airports, risks the flow of servicing processes, and has implications for the privacy of passengers. International flights often require a higher level of physical security than do domestic airports, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for both.|$|E
