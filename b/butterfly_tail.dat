2500|$|The metal {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage had {{a forward}} section which contained the cockpit {{ahead of the}} wing leading edge but became markedly slimmer aft, in pod and boom style. The KAI-14 had a 90° <b>butterfly</b> <b>tail</b> with straight tapered surfaces, squared tips and externally mass-balanced elevators. [...] It landed on a fixed monowheel, faired into the fuselage underside, which had a brake operated via the airbrake lever. The rear fuselage was protected by a tail bumper.|$|E
2500|$|The pusher engine, {{usually a}} 25hp (18.6kW) KFM 107ER {{two-cylinder}} horizontally-opposed two-stroke, {{is mounted on}} the upper rear of the pod. [...] Some aircraft have been powered by a 45hp (31kW) Rotax 447UL two-cylinder inline two-stroke or a Hirth F23 boxer motor. Just forward is the long, curved canopy over the cockpit, which reaches almost to the nose. [...] The Marco J-5 has side-stick control and instruments mounted above one another on a central vertical panel. [...] Aft of the pod the boom is slender and carries a large <b>butterfly</b> <b>tail</b> with full span control surfaces.|$|E
2500|$|Interest in {{high-speed}} flight, {{which led}} him to initiate work on swept wings starting in 1940, {{is evident from the}} advanced developments Messerschmitt had on his drawing board in 1944. While the Me 262 V9 Hochgeschwindigkeit I (HG I) actually flight-tested in 1944 had only small changes compared to combat aircraft, most notably a low-profile canopy—tried as the Rennkabine (literally [...] "racing cabin") on the ninth Me 262 prototype for a short time—to reduce drag, the HG II and HG III designs were far more radical. The projected HG II combined the low-drag canopy with a 35° wing sweep and a V-tail (<b>butterfly</b> <b>tail).</b> The HG III had a conventional tail, but a 45° wing sweep and turbines embedded in the wing roots.|$|E

2500|$|The Ka 3 and its {{predecessor}} the Ka 1 were mostly sold as kits for home assembly. [...] Apart from their fuselages {{the two types}} are very close in appearance, simplicity, weight and performance. [...] They share a round tipped high wing with constant chord and no sweep, mounted with 2.5° of dihedral and braced with a single lift strut on each side from the lower fuselage to the wing at about one third span. Plain, constant-chord ailerons reach almost from the tips to about mid span and upper wing spoilers are placed at mid chord, inboard of the ailerons. [...] Both have 37° <b>butterfly</b> <b>tails</b> with straight leading edges and round tips and trailing edges.|$|R

2500|$|The Alpha J-5 Marco, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the Janowski J-5 Marco after its designer, whose fifth aircraft it was, sometimes just as the J-5 Marco, is a single-seat pod-and-boom aircraft, with a pusher engine and a <b>butterfly</b> <b>tail.</b> [...] Janowski's earlier J-1, J-2 and J-3 designs were also pod-and-boom pushers, though with different tails. Designed to be homebuilt from a kit, the J-5's structure is almost entirely of glassfibre and epoxy. The wings are set {{at the top of}} the boom as it merges into the pod containing the engine and cockpit. [...] They have an aspect ratio of about 10 and constant chord, with flaperons, formed with glassfibre and duralumin, along the whole of the trailing edge. [...] The upper surfaces contain short spoilers at mid chord.|$|E
2500|$|Following Breguet's {{success in}} the 1954 and 1956 World Gliding Championships with the Type901, Jean Cayla {{designed}} the Type905 for the 1958 event. It is a Standard Class sailplane with a 15m (49ft3in) span. Like its predecessor, the 905 is a cantilever mid-wing monoplane but the its structure contains glass reinforced plastic, more plastic foam and less fabric. It also has a <b>butterfly</b> <b>tail.</b> It has a wing of straight tapered planform, terminated with small [...] "salmon" [...] fairings at the squared-off wingtips. [...] The major structural component is the main spar plus nose D-box unit, skinned with a plastic foam-filled ("Klegecel") sandwich with 0.6mm (0.024in)-ply outer layers. Ribs, ailerons and Schempp-Hirth airbrakes are attached to this torsion box. [...] The whole upper wing surface and outboard lower surface is ply, supported by an internal Klegecell lining, with fabric below, aft of the spar. [...] Slotted ailerons occupy the outer 45% of the trailing edge; there are no flaps. [...] Each complete wing weighs just 34kg (75lb).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Butterfly</b> <b>tail</b> (Man Shek-hay, 1993) or Butterfly {{telescope}} (Teichfischer, 1994) is {{a variety}} of goldfish that is distinguished by the butterfly-shaped caudal fins when viewed from above. It is a variety that has only recently been deemed a major lineage by a few published works. Because this tail conformation is commonly bred into the telescope eye goldfish, the term [...] "butterfly tail" [...] is just short for the many names this variety has such as <b>Butterfly</b> <b>Tail</b> Telescope, <b>Butterfly</b> <b>Tail</b> Demekin, <b>Butterfly</b> <b>Tail</b> Moor and Top view Telescope (TVT).|$|E

50|$|The <b>butterfly</b> <b>tail</b> is {{a variant}} {{form of the}} {{telescope}} goldfish with protruding eyes and is best appreciated by viewing it from above. While this tail variation is commonly paired with the telescope eye variation, 'butterfly shaped tails' may be present in other goldfish standard varieties such as ryukins or orandas. The tail spread is preferable 180 degrees but some may droop down at an angle due {{the weight of the}} long tail fins. With the rise in popularity of <b>butterfly</b> <b>tail</b> moors, there have been efforts to distinguish the different <b>butterfly</b> <b>tail</b> types such as the faery butterfly, shuan shu (Chinese comb tail) butterfly, delta and trapezium tail butterfly.|$|E

The ailerons are metal and are shorter on production aircraft. Inboard airbrakes, again shorter in production aircraft, can extend from both upper and lower surfaces. The <b>butterfly</b> <b>tail</b> consists of two all moving surfaces, with wood sandwich leading edges and fabric covering elsewhere. Both carry trim tabs.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{behaviour}} of this widespread, but shy and skulking, bird, which people hear far more often than they see. It {{appears to be a}} mainly solitary species.

5000|$|One form of such mimicry {{is where}} {{one part of}} an organism's body {{resemble}}s another part. For example, the tails of some snakes resemble their heads; they move backwards when threatened and present the predator with the tail, improving their chances of escape without fatal harm. Some fishes have eyespots near their tails, and when mildly alarmed swim slowly backwards, presenting the tail as a head. Some insects such as some lycaenid <b>butterflies</b> have <b>tail</b> patterns and appendages of various degrees of sophistication that promote attacks at the rear {{rather than at the}} head. Several species of pygmy owl bear [...] "false eyes" [...] {{on the back of the}} head, misleading predators into reacting as though they were the subject of an aggressive stare.|$|R

5000|$|Each hindwing of this <b>butterfly</b> has two <b>tails.</b> Both {{the male}} and female have pale grey {{markings}} of the same colour and a distinctive black edge {{on the underside of the}} wings. These markings are similar to an orchid tit (Chliaria othona) pattern. There are no particular print markings below the costal vein at the anterior of the forewings. The male species have a pale-blue print above the costal vein on the forewing and the upperside of the hindwings are broadly black bordered. The posterior area between the borders and the coral vein are violet in colour. The females of the species have a dark brown colour with black borders above the coral vein and a white discal posterior section. On both sexes the veins appear very dark on the upperside of the hindwings.|$|R
50|$|In aircraft, a V-tail or Vee-tail (sometimes {{called a}} <b>Butterfly</b> <b>tail)</b> is an {{unconventional}} {{arrangement of the}} tail control surfaces that replaces the traditional fin and horizontal surfaces with two surfaces set in a V-shaped configuration when viewed from the front or rear of the aircraft.

The research was conducted in April 2014 to March 2015 on two areas Bantimurung and Pattunuang. Our observation was used Cruise Methods and data analysis with descriptive methods. The result was showed total number of butterfly about 57 individuals divided into Bantimurung 12 individuals and Pattunuang 45 individuals. Based on Pearsons analysis temperature r 0. 716 p 0. 009 and rainfall periods r 0. 676 p 0. 016 has strong correlation with presence of G. androcles. On the other hand no correlation with humidity r- 0. 888 p 0. 786 and light intensity r 0. 172 p 0. 593 {{in the presence of}} butterfly. We find more G. androcles in the beginning of dry season end of Juni until November 2014 on the river area and open field. Commonly the activity of butterfly was started 11. 00 until 14. 00 am.

5000|$|The {{possible}} {{failure of}} this novel wing {{to be delivered}} in time had been anticipated by {{the building of a}} wooden wing to the same specification by Elliotts of Newbury, to be fitted to the Miles-built wooden fuselage, shorter than the Crabpot and with a <b>butterfly</b> <b>tail.</b> [...] This glider was known as the Kendall K.1 or by the Elliotts' designation EoN Type 9 K.1 and first flew in March 1954. It was not a success, failing to obtain its certificate of airworthiness because of insoluble spinning characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The Fouga CM.170 Magister was a French jet trainer, {{developed}} to perform both basic and intermediate training activities. It is a compact, tandem seat aircraft with performance akin to larger, more powerful aircraft. Comparatively, {{it was a}} higher performance aircraft than the rival British-built BAC Jet Provost, and was considered by Flight International to be comparable to Fokker S.14 Machtrainer. It featured a distinctive 'butterfly' tail configuration; a conventional tail was tried but found to be aerodynamically inferior at higher speeds. A keel fitted under the rear fuselage functions to reduce thenegative dihedral effect of the <b>butterfly</b> <b>tail</b> during rudder applications.|$|E
50|$|In 1947 a British Gliding Association design competition, for a two-seat sailplane, was won by Hugh Kendall, Miles' {{assistant}} test pilot.

A version {{with a novel}} asbestos fibre-polymer wing and a wooden fuselage with a <b>butterfly</b> <b>tail</b> was proposed by Miles, but the wing failed under low loads. Elliotts of Newbury built a conventional wooden wing to use with Miles' fuselage. The resulting glider flew, but not well and development was abandoned with just one example built.|$|E

The small, streamlined Satellite monocoque fuselage consisted of panels of an extremely light magnesium-zirconium alloy. The original contours tapered to a <b>butterfly</b> <b>tail</b> that was eliminated and replaced by a single fin to be topped by a tailplane in a [...] "T tail" [...] design; surprisingly, the Satellite fuselage was integrated seamlessly into the new helicopter planform.|$|E

50|$|Messerschmitt {{designed}} {{a number of}} different high-altitude fighter projects which were submitted in February 1945. One of the designs, the Me P.1110 Ente (Duck), had a 40° wing sweep and annular air intakes in front of the wing root (akin to the North American YF-93), feeding a single Heinkel HeS 011A jet engine; the annular intakes, while flowing four percent less air, would suffer fifteen percent less drag than a single nose intake. The aircraft was to be armed with three MK 108 cannon in the nose, plus perhaps two more in the 40°-swept wings. There was a proposed <b>butterfly</b> <b>tail</b> variant, as well. Projected maximum speed was 1015 km/h.|$|E
