500|$|In a mixed review, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times {{dubbed the}} album Kelly's [...] "least ambitious" [...] {{and found it}} [...] "tepid" [...] by his standards, [...] "which is to say, {{completely}} technically accomplished, but lacking the snakelike vocal slither and moist subject matter that mark him at his most virtuosic." [...] Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson panned its music as [...] "this-porridge-is-just-right uptempo mush" [...] and questioned its genuineness, writing that [...] "even if the songs sound like the height of artifice ... there's little doubt [...] believes in his own hollow offerings." [...] Pitchfork Media's Jess Harvell observed [...] "a fine line between breezy and half-assed" [...] in the songwriting and criticized its [...] "cut-rate production choices" [...] behind [...] "Kelly's engaged vocal performances." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune called it [...] "a less-consistently strong sequel" [...] and stated, [...] "Listeners may find themselves toggling between questioning Kelly’s sincerity and admiring his facility as a producer and singer."

6000|$|There are {{two letters}} in the [...] "Clarion" [...] this week which in various ways {{interest}} me very much. One is concerned to defend Darwin against the scientific revolt against him that was led by Samuel Butler, and among other things it calls Bernard Shaw a <b>back</b> <b>number.</b> Well, most certainly [...] "The Origin of Species" [...] is a <b>back</b> <b>number,</b> {{in so far as}} any honest and interesting book ever can be; but in pure philosophy nothing can be out of date, since the universe must be a mystery even to the believer. There is, however, one condition of things in which I do call it relevant to describe somebody as behind the times. That is when the man in question, thinking of some state of affairs that has passed away, is really helping the very things he would like to hinder. The principles cannot alter, but the problems can. Thus, I should call a man behind the times who, in the year 1872, pleaded for the peaceful German peasants against the triumphant militarism of Napoleon. Or I should call a man out of date who, in the year 1892, wished for a stronger Navy to compete with the Navy of Holland, because it had once swept the sea and sailed up the Thames. And I certainly call a man or a movement out of date that, in the year 1914, when we few are fighting a giant machine, strengthened with all material wealth and worked with all the material sciences, thinks that our chief danger is from an excess of moral and religious responsibility. He reminds me of Mr. Snodgrass, who had {{the presence of mind to}} call out [...] "Fire!" [...] when Mr. Pickwick fell through the ice.|$|E
60|$|One of {{the things}} which make life on this planet more or less {{agreeable}} is {{the speed with which}} alarums, excursions, excitement, and rows generally, blow over. A nine-days' wonder has to be a big business to last out its full time nowadays. As a rule the third day sees the end of it, and the public rushes whooping after some other hare that has been started for its benefit. The guard-tent row, as far as the bulk of camp was concerned, lasted exactly two days; {{at the end of which}} period it was generally agreed that all that could be said on the subject had been said, and that it was now a <b>back</b> <b>number.</b> Nobody, except possibly the authorities, wanted to find out the authors of the raid, and even Private Jones had ceased to talk about it--this owing to the unsympathetic attitude of his tent.|$|E
60|$|To {{return to}} that first question. M. Bourget, as teacher, would simply be France {{teaching}} America. It {{seemed to me that}} the outlook was dark--almost Egyptian, in fact. What would the new teacher, representing France, teach us? Railroading? No. France knows nothing valuable about railroading. Steamshipping? No. France has no superiorities over us in that matter. Steamboating? No. French steamboating is still of Fulton's date--1809. Postal service? No. France is a <b>back</b> <b>number</b> there. Telegraphy? No, we taught her that ourselves. Journalism? No. Magazining? No, that is our own specialty. Government? No; Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, Nobility, Democracy, Adultery the system is too variegated for our climate. Religion? No, not variegated enough for our climate. Morals? No, we cannot rob the poor to enrich ourselves. Novel-writing? No. M. Bourget and the others know only one plan, and when that is expurgated there is nothing left of the book.|$|E

60|$|He {{walked up}} and down the study {{considering}} what first step he should take to effect the purpose in view. Under the quickening influence of his irritation, an idea occurred to him, which, if it had only entered his mind the day before, might probably have proved the means of saving him from placing himself under an obligation to Mr. Rambert. He resolved to write immediately to his bookseller and publisher in London (who knew him well as an old and excellent customer), mentioning the date of the <b>back</b> <b>number</b> of the Times that was required, and authorizing the publisher to offer any reward he judged necessary to any person who might have the means of procuring it at the office of the paper or elsewhere. This letter he wrote and dispatched in good time for the London post, and then went upstairs to see his wife and to tell her what had happened. Her room was still darkened and she was still on the sofa. On the subject of the missing number she said nothing, but of Mr. Rambert and his note she spoke with the most sovereign contempt. Of course the pompous old fool was mistaken, and the proper thing to do was to send back the volume instantly and take no more notice of him.|$|E
6000|$|It is a part, I think, of this {{disposition}} to investigate what makes everyone collect [...] "specimens" [...] of the war. Everywhere the souvenir forces itself upon the attention. The homecoming permissionaire brings with him invariably a considerable weight of broken objects, bits of shell, cartridge clips, helmets; it is a peripatetic museum. It {{is as if}} he hoped for a clue. It is almost impossible, I have found, to escape these pieces in evidence. I am the least collecting of men, but I have brought home Italian cartridges, Austrian cartridges, the fuse of an Austrian shell, a broken Italian bayonet, and a note that is worth half a franc {{within the confines of}} Amiens. But a large heavy piece of exploded shell that had been thrust very urgently upon my attention upon the Carso I contrived to lose during the temporary confusion of our party by the arrival and explosion of another prospective souvenir in our close proximity. And two really very large and almost complete specimens of some species of Ammonites unknown to me, from the hills to the east of the Adige, partially wrapped in a <b>back</b> <b>number</b> of the Corriere della Sera, that were pressed upon me by a friendly officer, were unfortunately lost on the line between Verona and Milan through the gross negligence of a railway porter.

It's what he is and what he means to be that counts. Mr. Patrick McEachern, of Corven Abbey, isn't the same as Constable McEachern, of the New York police. Well, then, I have nothing to do with the man I was when you knew me first. I have disowned him. He's a <b>back</b> <b>number.</b> I am an ordinary English gentleman now.
