5|$|Capodacqua of La Repubblica {{believed}} that the route favored a rider that could defend well {{and put in a}} good time during the uphill time trial. La Stampa writer Gianni Ranieri felt the two non-uphill time trials would favor Gianni Bugno, while the up-hill time trial could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> Claudio Chiappucci could gain time on the field. Pedro Delgado believed the race to be tougher than the Tour de France that same year. The Cima Coppi – the highest point in altitude the race reached – was scheduled to be the Passo dello Stelvio, but the pass was scrapped from the race and the Passo Pordoi – the next highest mountain – became the new Cima Coppi.|$|E

500|$|A {{significant}} {{element of}} delusion permeated his thinking: Bundy was always surprised when anyone noticed {{that one of}} his victims was missing, because he imagined America to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> everyone is invisible except to themselves. And he was always astounded when people testified that they had seen him in incriminating places, because Bundy did not believe people noticed each other. [...] "I don't know why everyone is out to get me", he complained to Lewis. [...] "He really and truly did not have any sense of the enormity of what he had done," [...] she said. [...] "A long-term serial killer erects powerful barriers to his guilt," [...] Keppel wrote, [...] "walls of denial that can sometimes never be breached." [...] Nelson agreed.

500|$|Hamilton adapted {{an idea of}} his {{involving}} Bond in Disneyland for Scaramanga's funhouse. The funhouse {{was designed}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> Scaramanga could get the upper hand by distracting the adversary with obstacles, and was described by Murton as a [...] "melting pot of ideas" [...] which made it [...] "both a funhouse and a horror house". While an actual wax figure of Roger Moore was used, Moore's stunt double Les Crawford was the cowboy figure, and Ray Marione played the Al Capone figure. The canted sets such as the funhouse and the Queen Elizabeth had inspiration from German Expressionism films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. For Scaramanga's solar power plant, Hamilton used both the Pinewood set and a miniature projected by Derek Meddings, often cutting between each other to show there was no discernible difference. The destruction of the facility {{was a combination of}} practical effects on the set and a destruction of the miniature. Meddings based the island blowing up on footage of the Battle of Monte Cassino.|$|E
500|$|Leaving Oldbridge, the Way {{follows the}} road for {{approximately}} [...] before turning onto a boreen. To {{the left of the}} boreen is Wart Stone Field, so called on account of a bullaun stone that lies in the field, water from which is said to cure warts. The boreen ends at Brusher Gap, reputed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> locals left food and supplies for Michael Dwyer and his followers when they went on the run after the 1798 Rebellion. The Way enters Drummin forest, a sitka spruce plantation, where it passes an Adirondack shelter, constructed by Mountain , a volunteer group dedicated to trail preservation that has upgraded various sections of the Wicklow Way over the years. The trail climbs Paddock Hill before descending into a plantation of larch trees. The forest floor here is a habitat for spurges, heath bedstraw and fly agaric toadstools. The trail crosses the Military Road, near Laragh, and then a wooden footbridge across the Glenmacnass River. A dense spread of granite boulders litters the riverbed, glacial erratics deposited by melting glaciers {{at the end of the}} last ice age. This stretch of the trail follows an old mass path through a woodland of many native Irish tree species, including oak, rowan, silver birch and willow, carpeted with a forest floor of bilberry, bluebell and hard fern. The Way continues along forest tracks over the shoulder of Brockagh Mountain. At the highest point there is a vista over the Vale of Glendalough with the two lakes nestled in the shelter of Camaderry and Derrybawn Mountains. Exiting the forest, the Way reaches the R756 road and the Glendalough visitor centre. Crossing the Glendasan River, it passes the remains of the Monastic City, founded in the 6th century by Saint Kevin.|$|E

In education, Willis believed that girls should {{not try to}} be like boys, and she aimed at a serious attitude towards education, preparing some of her pupils for university life. She could be difficult {{to work with and}} knew little of housekeeping, but many of her staff, like her business partner Lilian Heather, were devoted to her.

2500|$|Therefore we {{conclude}} that the bosom of Abraham signifies nothing else than the Word of God,.... the hell here mentioned cannot be the true hell that will begin {{on the day of}} judgment. For the corpse of the rich man is without doubt not in hell, but buried in the earth; it must however <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> the soul can be and has no peace, and it cannot be corporeal. Therefore it seems to me, this hell is the conscience, which is without faith and without the Word of God, in which the soul is buried and held until the day of judgment, when they are cast down body and soul into the true and real hell.

A lot of this music was written when things were really puritanical and women didn’t have any rights, and so there isn’t a lot of embracing of the feminine except with the Virgin Mary, if that makes any sense. Because he and I were talking about music that goes back, a more pagan style of music where there seems to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> goddesses were honoured if you go back into antiquity.

2500|$|In 1681, in partial {{repayment}} of a debt, Charles II of England granted William Penn {{a charter}} {{for what would}} become the Pennsylvania colony. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape to be on good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for his colony. Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon, in what is now the city's Fishtown section. Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is Greek for brotherly love (from philos, [...] "love" [...] or [...] "friendship", and adelphos, [...] "brother"). As a Quaker, Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> anyone could worship freely. This tolerance, far more than afforded by most other colonies, led to better relations with the local Native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city.|$|E
2500|$|Chakraverti {{announced}} {{the launch of}} the Wiccan Brigade in November 2006. It was a platform for those interested in studying Wicca and using the branch of knowledge to holistic effect. Though Wicca was predominantly practiced by women, Wiccan Brigade welcomed men also. Chakraverti commented, [...] "Close to 100 people, comprising professionals, some housewives and many students, have approached me on the Net to start the group. I think it’s the right time to institutionalize Wicca. [...] Though it wouldn’t be possible to have here the kind of training we had in the Laurentians, there would be sessions on yoga and meditation, and lectures and group discussions." [...] A batch of 25 people were selected through a screening process and they [...] participated in the sessions consisting of social, historical, psychological and gender-related issues of Wicca. In July 2007, the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) nominated Chakraverti to head a panel tasked with improving the status of young girls in India. She launched the Wiccan Brigade in London in December 2007and [...] named it [...] Ipsita’s Yogini Club. Chakraverti commented, [...] "I’ve always believed the yogini and the witch are the same, and London seems to me to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> various cultures of the world have come together.

2500|$|Stolen (1998) is a play by Australian playwright Jane Harrison. It {{tells the}} story of five fictional Aboriginal people by the names of Sandy, Ruby, Jimmy, Anne, and Shirley who dealt with the issues for {{forceful}} removal by Australian governments. Sandy has spent his entire life on the run, never having a set home to live in. Stolen tracks his quest for a place to <b>be,</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> he does not have keep hiding from the government (even though they are no longer after him), and a place he can call home. Ruby was forced to work as a domestic servant from a young age and was sent insane by the constant pressure forced upon her by her white masters. She spends a lot of her time mumbling to herself, whilst her family desperately tries to help her. Jimmy was separated from his mother at a very young age, and she spent her entire life looking for him. He {{spent a lot of time}} in prison and, on the day he finally got out, he was told about his mother's search. As he went to meet her, she died, and he committed suicide in anger. Anne was removed from her family and placed in a Caucasian family's home. She was materially happy in this home, a lot happier than many of the other characters, but when her indigenous family tried to meet her, she was caught in crossfire between her two [...] "families". Shirley was removed from her parents and had her children removed from her. She only felt relief, safety, and comfort when her granddaughter was born and not removed.|$|E
