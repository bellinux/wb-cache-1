40|$|Relativistic {{heavy ion}} {{collisions}} provide laboratory environments from {{which one can}} study {{the creation of a}} novel state of matter, the quark gluon plasma. The existence of such a state is postulated to alter the mechanism and evolution of charge production, which then becomes manifest in charge correlations. We study the separation of <b>balancing</b> <b>charges</b> at kinetic freeze-out by analyzing recent result on balancing charge correlations for Au+Au collisions at √(s_NN) = 200 GeV. We find that <b>balancing</b> <b>charges</b> are emitted from significantly smaller regions in central collisions compared to peripheral collisions. The results indicate that charge diffusion is small and that the centrality dependence points to a change of the production mechanism. In addition we calculate the contributions from charge-balance correlations to STAR's local parity violation observable. We find that local charge conservation, when combined with elliptic flow, explains much of STAR's measurement. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figure...|$|E
40|$|In the {{canonical}} {{picture of the}} evolution of the quark-gluon plasma during a high-energy heavy-ion collision, quarks are produced in two waves. The first is during the first fm/c of the collision, when gluons thermalize into the QGP. After a roughly isentropic expansion that roughly conserves the number of quarks, a second wave ensues at hadronization, 5 - 10 fm/c into the collision. Since each hadron contains at least two quarks, the majority of quark production occurs at this later time. For each quark produced in a heavy-ion collision, an anti-quark of the same flavor is created at the same point in space-time. Charge balance functions identify, on a statistical basis, the location of <b>balancing</b> <b>charges</b> for a given hadron, and given the picture above one expects the distribution in relative rapidity of <b>balancing</b> <b>charges</b> to be characterized by two scales. After first demonstrating how charge balance functions can be created using any pair of hadronic states, it will be shown how one can identify and study both processes of quark production. By considering balance functions of several hadronic species, and by performing illustrative calculations, this class of measurement appears to hold the prospect of providing the field's most stringent insight into the chemical evolution of the QGP.

40|$|AbstractIn high-energy heavy-ion collisions, the {{correlations}} between the emitted particles {{can be used as a}} probe to gain insight into the charge creation mechanisms. In this Letter, we report the first results of such studies using the electric charge balance function in the relative pseudorapidity (Δη) and azimuthal angle (Δφ) in Pb–Pb collisions at sNN= 2. 76  TeV with the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The width of the balance function decreases with growing centrality (i. e. for more central collisions) in both projections. This centrality dependence is not reproduced by HIJING, while AMPT, a model which incorporates strings and parton rescattering, exhibits qualitative agreement with the measured correlations in Δφ but fails to describe {{the correlations}} in Δη. A thermal blast-wave model incorporating local charge conservation and tuned to describe the pT spectra and v 2 measurements reported by ALICE, is used to fit the centrality dependence of the width of the balance function and to extract the average separation of <b>balancing</b> <b>charges</b> at freeze-out. The comparison of our results with measurements at lower energies reveals an ordering with sNN: the balance functions become narrower with increasing energy for all centralities. This is consistent with the effect of larger radial flow at the LHC energies but also with the late stage creation scenario of <b>balancing</b> <b>charges.</b> However, the relative decrease of the balance function widths in Δη and Δφ with centrality from the highest SPS to the LHC energy exhibits only small differences.

40|$|Correlations from charge {{conservation}} {{are affected}} by when charge/anticharge pairs are created {{during the course of}} a relativistic heavy ion collision. For charges created early, <b>balancing</b> <b>charges</b> are typically separated by the order of one unit of spatial rapidity by the end of the collision, whereas those charges produced later in the collision are far more correlated. By analyzing correlations from STAR for different species, I show that one can distinguish the two separate waves of charge creation expected in a high-energy collision, one at early times when the QGP is formed and a second at hadronization. Further, I extract the density of up, down and strange quarks at in the QGP and find agreement at the 20 % level with expectations for a chemically thermalized plasma.

40|$|By {{analyzing}} preliminary experimental {{measurements of}} charge-balance functions from the STAR Collaboration at the Relativistic-Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC), {{it is found}} that pictures where <b>balancing</b> <b>charges</b> are produced in a single surge, and therefore separated by a single length scale, are inconsistent with data. In contrast, a model that assumes two surges, one associated with the formation of a thermalized quark-gluon plasma and a second associated with hadronization, provides a far superior reproduction of the data. A statistical analysis of the model comparison finds that the two-surge model best reproduces the data if the charge production from the first surge is similar to expectations for equilibrated matter taken from lattice gauge theory. The charges created in the first surge appear to separate by approximately one unit of spatial rapidity before emission, while charges from the second wave appear to have separated by approximately a half unit or less.

40|$|STAR has {{recently}} reported charge-dependent azimuthal correlations that {{are sensitive to}} the charge separation effect in Au+Au collisions at √(s_ NN) = 200 GeV. Qualitatively, these results agree with some of the theoretical predictions for local parity violation in heavy-ion collisions. However, a study using reaction-plane-dependent balance functions shows an alternative origin of this signal. The balance function, which measures the correlation between oppositely charged pairs, is sensitive to the mechanisms of charge formation and the subsequent relative diffusion of the <b>balancing</b> <b>charges.</b> The reaction-plane-dependent balance function measurements can be related to STAR's charge-dependent azimuthal correlations. We report reaction-plane-dependent balance functions for Au+Au collisions at √(s_ NN) = 200, 62. 4, 39, 11. 5, and 7. 7 GeV using the STAR detector. The model of Schlichting and Pratt incorporating local charge conservation and elliptic flow reproduces most of the three-particle azimuthal correlation results at 200 GeV. The experimental charge-dependent azimuthal charge correlations observed at 200 GeV can be explained in terms of local charge conservation and elliptic flow.
