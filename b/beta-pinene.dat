In the oxidation of alkenes, the product selectivity strongly {{depends on the}} nature of metal (Fe or Cr) but, for the same metal, only slightly differs for the MIL- 100 and MIL- 101 structures. The Fe- containing MOFs afford the formation of unsaturated alcohols while Cr-based MOFs give mainly unsaturated ketones. Both Cr-MIL- 100 and Cr-MIL- 101 favor decomposition of cyclohexenyl hydroperoxide to produce 2 -cyclohexen- 1 -one with 67 - 69 % selectivity. Stability toward destruction reduced in the order Cr-MIL- 101, Cr-MIL- 100 > Fe-MIL- 100 > Fe-MIL- 101. In the oxidation of anthracene over both Cr-MOFs and Fe-MIL- 101, the selectivity toward 9, 10 -anthraquinone (AQ) attained 100 % at 92 - 100 % AN conversion. The turnover frequency (TOF) decreased in the order Cr-MIL- 101 > Fe-MIL- 101 > Cr-MIL- 100 > Fe-MIL- 100. Cr-MIL- 101 revealed superior catalytic performance in terms of AN conversion, AQ selectivity and TOF. Nearly quantitative yield of AQ was obtained after 1. 5 h at 100 degrees C in chlorobenzene as solvent. No leaching of active metal occurred under optimal reaction conditions and the MOFs could be recycled several times without deterioration of the catalytic properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

Here we use a 6 -year (1996 - 2001) HCHO column data set from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) satellite instrument to (1) quantify these errors, (2) evaluate GOME-derived isoprene emissions with in situ flux measurements and a process-based emission inventory (Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature, MEGAN), and (3) investigate the factors driving the seasonal and interannual variability of North American isoprene emissions. The error in the GOME HCHO column retrieval {{is estimated to be}} 40 %. We use the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) to quantify the time-dependent HCHO production from isoprene, alpha- and <b>beta-pinenes,</b> and methylbutenol and show that only emissions of isoprene are detectable by GOME. The time-dependent HCHO yield from isoprene oxidation calculated by MCM is 20 - 30 % larger than in GEOS-CHEM. GOME-derived isoprene fluxes track the observed seasonal variation of in situ measurements at a Michigan forest site with a - 30 % bias. The seasonal variation of North American isoprene emissions during 2001 inferred from GOME is similar to MEGAN, with GOME emissions typically 25 % higher (lower) at the beginning (end) of the growing season. GOME and MEGAN both show a maximum over the southeastern United States, but they differ in the precise location. The observed interannual variability of this maximum is 20 - 30 %, depending on month. The MEGAN isoprene emission dependence on surface air temperature explains 75 % of the month-to-month variability in GOME-derived isoprene emissions over the southeastern United States during May-September 1996 - 2001...|$|R

Objective: Investigation of the chemical composition and cytotoxicity of essential oil from Nectandra leucantha Nees & Mart. leaves. This is the first study involving N. leucantha reported in the literature. Material and methods: the essential oil of N. leucantha leaves was obtained by hydrodistillation. Its chemical composition was determined using a combination of GC/FID, GC/MS, and determination of Kovats index (KI). in vitro cytotoxic activity was evaluated against six cancer cell lines - murine melanoma (B 16 F 10 -Nex 2), human glioblastome (U- 87), human cervical carcinoma (HeLa), human colon carcinoma (HCT), human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF 7), and human cervical tumor (Siha) as well as against one non-tumorigenic cell line - human foreskin fibroblast (HFF). Results: Thirty-three compounds were identified primarily sesquiterpenes (81. 41 %), the main compounds being bicyclogermacrene (28. 44 %), germacrene A (7. 34 %), spathulenol (5. 82 %), and globulol (5. 25 %). Furthermore, monoterpenes were also found in the analyzed oil (12. 84 %), predominantly alpha- and <b>beta-pinenes</b> (6. 59 and 4. 57 %, respectively). the crude essential oil displayed significant cytotoxic activity against B 16 F 10 -Nex 2 (IC 50 33 +/- 1 mu g/mL) and U 87 (IC 50 75. 95 +/- 0. 03 mu g/mL) and HeLa (IC 50 60 +/- 12 mu g/mL) cell lines. the main identified compound, bicyclogermacrene, displayed IC 50 ranging from 3. 1 +/- 0. 2 to 21 +/- 6 mu g/mL. Discussion and conclusion: the results indicate that the crude oils from leaves of N. leucantha displayed cytotoxic activity being bicyclogermacrene, the main compound identified in the crude oil responsible, at least in part, for this potential.

Furthermore, delta C- 13 values of the gas-phase <b>beta-pinene</b> and one of its oxidation products, nopinone, were measured using a gas chromatograph coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (GC-IRMS). <b>beta-Pinene</b> was progressively enriched with the heavy carbon isotope due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE). The KIE of the reaction of <b>beta-pinene</b> with ozone was measured to be 1. 0026 ((O 3) epsilon 2. 6 +/- 1. 5 parts per thousand). The delta C- 13 value of total secondary organic aerosol was very similar to that of its precursor (average = - 29. 6 +/- 0. 2 parts per thousand) independent of experiment time.

The mean blood clearance 21 hours after exposure (CL 21 h) of alpha-pinene, <b>beta-pinene</b> and 3 -carene, were 0. 8, 0. 5, and 0. 4 l. kg- 1. h- 1, respectively. The mean half lives (t 1 / 2) of the last phase of alpha-pinene, <b>beta-pinene,</b> and 3 -carene averaged 32, 25, and 42 hours, respectively. The t 1 / 2 s agreed with previously calculated half lives from single exposures. The total blood clearance CL 21 h of 3 -carene found in this turpentine study was lower, and CL 4 h of 3 -carene was significantly lower than the values obtained from similar exposure to pure 3 -carene. The subjects attending both exposure to turpentine and to pure alpha-pinene at 450 mg/m 3 had lower CL 4 h during the exposure to turpentine, when they experienced more discomfort of the throat or the airways (F = 5. 7, P = 0. 048) than during exposure to control concentrations. After experimental exposure to turpentine an increase in airway resistance was found that differed significantly from results of exposure to 3 -carene at 10 mg/m 3 (P = 0. 021) or 450 mg/m 3 (P = 0. 047). CONCLUSIONS: Toxicokinetics and acute effects show small, if any, interactions between alpha-pinene, <b>beta-pinene,</b> and 3 -carene. The subjects experienced discomfort in the throat and airways during exposure to turpentine and airway resistance was increased after the end of exposure...|$|E
40|$|Little {{information}} {{on the effects of}} cyclohexane at the cellular or subcellular level is available. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cyclohexane inhibited respiration and diverse energy-dependent processes. In mitochondria isolated from S. cerevisiae, oxygen uptake and ATP synthesis were inhibited, although ATPase activity was not affected. Cyclohexane effects were similar to those reported for <b>beta-pinene</b> and limonene, suggesting that the cyclohexane ring in these monoterpenes may be a determinant for their biological activities...|$|E

Carvone was chosen as a model compound to examine some of the general features of this reaction, such as stoichiometry, temperature, reaction time and product conversion. Treatment of <b>beta-pinene</b> with sodium hypochlorite {{in the presence of}} indium trichloride resulted in a facile rearrangement to selectively yield perillyl chloride, which is an important precursor for C- 7 oxygenated limonenes...|$|E
40|$|The O- 3 -initiated {{oxidation}} of <b>beta-pinene,</b> a monoterpene emitted in forested areas, was theoretically characterized using DFT, CBS-QB 3 and CASPT 2 quantum chemical calculations {{combined with}} statistical kinetic RRKM/master equation analysis and transition state theory. The first-principles based rate coefficient {{of the initial}} O- 3 attack on the exocyclic double bond shows a slight positive temperature dependence, k(tot) (T) = 1. 27 x 10 (- 22) x T- 2. 64 x exp(- 714 K/T) cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1), and is {{in close agreement with}} experiment. The resulting primary ozonides are found to give rise to two distinct, non-interconvertible conformers of the predominant Criegee intermediate (CI- 1 and CI- 2), with subsequent chemistries that are shown to be very different; this crucial aspect of <b>beta-pinene</b> ozonolysis was not taken into account in earlier studies. One of the conformers CI- 2 -carrying nearly half the total reaction flux-cannot undergo the usual "hydroperoxide channel'', thus rationalizing why the OH yield from <b>beta-pinene</b> is barely half of that from a-pinene. The predicted first-generation product distribution for atmospheric conditions is consistent with the available experimental data on the overall products. Our final results predict 5 % of nopinone formation, 28 % OH radicals with 2 -oxo-alkyl radical coproducts, 37 % of stabilized Criegee intermediates (SCI), 17 % lactones, 10 % CO 2 formed after an intersystem crossing, and 3 % of a newly proposed biradical formed from prompt ring opening in the CI. In atmospheric conditions, additional OH production is expected from the stabilized CI- 1 conformer via the thermal unimolecular "hydroperoxide channel'', whereas the stabilized CI- 2 can react with H 2 O and its dimer, to produce additional nopinone. The expected subsequent chemistries of the large coproduct radicals formed from reactions of the two CI are also addressed in extenso. status: publishe...|$|E
