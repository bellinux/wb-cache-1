40|$|Quantitative {{analyses}} of the chemical state of the 16 c residue of the alpha 1 chain of bone collagen were performed on samples from fetal (4 - 6 -month embryo) and mature (2 - 3 year old) <b>bovine</b> <b>animals.</b> <b>All</b> of this residue could be accounted for in terms of three chemical states, in relative amounts which depended upon {{the age of the}} animal. Most of the residue was incorporated into either bifunctional or trifunctional cross-links. Some of it, however, was present as free aldehyde, and the content increased with maturation. This was established by isolating and characterizing the aldehyde-containing peptides generated by tryptic digestion of NaB 3 H 4 -reduced mature bone collagen. We have concluded that the connectivity of COOH-terminal cross-linking in bone collagen fibrils changes with maturation in the following way: at first, each 16 c residue in each of the two alpha 1 chains of the collagen molecule is incorporated into a sheet-like pattern of intermolecular iminium cross-links, which stabilizes the young, nonmineralized fibril as a whole. In time, some of these labile cross-links maturate into pyridinoline while others dissociate back to their precursor form. The latter is likely due to changes in the molecular packing brought about by the mineralization of the collagen fibrils. The resultant reduction in cross-linking connectivity may provide a mechanism for enhancing certain mechanical characteristics of the skeleton of a mature animal...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{seasonal}} and regional differences in diet composition {{on the food}} requirements of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) were estimated by using a bioenergetic model. The model considered differences in the energy density of the prey, and differences in digestive efficiency and the heat increment of feeding of different diets. The model predicted that Steller sea lions in southeast Alaska required 45 – 60 % more food per day in early spring (March) than after the breeding season in late summer (August) because of seasonal changes in the energy density of the diets (along with seasonal changes in energy requirements). The southeast Alaska population, at 23, 000 (± 1660 SD) <b>animals</b> (<b>all</b> <b>ages),</b> consumed an estimated 140, 000 (± 27, 800) t of prey in 1998. In contrast, we estimated that the 51, 000 (± 3680) animals making up the western Alaska population in the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands consumed just over twice this amount (303, 000 [± 57, 500] t). In terms of biomass removed in 1998 from Alaskan waters, we estimated that Steller sea lions accounted for about 5 % of the natural mortality of gadids (pollock and cod) and up to 75 % of the natural mortality of hexagrammids (adult Atka mackerel). These two groups of species were consumed in higher amounts than any other. The predicted average daily food requirement per individual ranged from 16 (± 2. 8) to 20 (± 3. 6) kg (<b>all</b> <b>ages</b> combined). Per capita food requirements differed {{by as much as}} 24 % between regions of Alaska depending on the relative amounts of low–energy-density prey (e. g. gadids) versus high–energy-density prey (e. g. forage fish and salmon) consumed.

40|$|I {{am writing}} to clarify a comment I {{submitted}} to the above mentioned docket on May 7, 2004. I had previously written that {{the entire length of}} the intestine should be excluded as SRM. I still hold this opinion and submit the same recommendation, however one of the reasons behind this opinion needs to be further clarified. I had misunderstood comments made by Dr. Danny Matthews in that immunostaining (of PrP bse) was not found throughout {{the entire length of the}} intestine. There was however immunostaining in the myenteric plexus of the distal ileum in both naturally infected and experimentally challenged cattle with BSE. (Terry et al., 2003) Given that the myenteric plexus exists throughout the intestine one cannot eliminate the possibility of infectivity being in other sections. In fact this was some of the thought behind the designation of the entire intestine as SRM in the EU: In its opinion of 7 - 8 December 2000 (EC 2000), the SSC concluded that the entire bovine intestine is a risk issue and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 270 / 2002 (14 th February 2002) ANNEX II designates “the entire intestines from the duodenum to the rectum and the mesentery of <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> of <b>all</b> ages; ” as SRM.

The ontogenetic differences of Se redistribution in a body under influence of cadmium administration were found. The discovered decrease of Se concentration in the liver of young animals and the increase of its concentration in the liver of old animals correlated positively with the changes of GPx activity.

Lesions frequently persisted for a longer interval post-exposure in lacrimal glands than in salivary glands. The persistence of lesions commonly seen in Harderian glands was attributed, at least in part, to the cytotoxic effects of porphyrin-containing secretions released during the acute necrotizing stages of the disease. The persistence of lesions in some lacrimal glands indicates that they are useful tissues for microscopic examination for the retrospective provisional diagnosis of SDA. Persistent lesions also indicate that normal functions of these glands may be compromised for up to several weeks following outbreaks of SDA.

The Charolais had greater thoracic perimeter than the Nellore, however this difference decreased gradually with advancing age, being equal between the two genetic groups at 24 months. For width of the rump, ischial opening and thoracic perimeter crossbred animals showed higher values than the purebred <b>animals</b> at <b>all</b> <b>ages,</b> but less pronounced at eight months of <b>age.</b> For <b>all</b> morphometric measurements, with exception of rump height, the differences of crossbreds males {{in relation to the}} purebreds, were more evident in relation to the Nellore. Heterosis was significant for morphometric measurements in male beef cattle. Morphometric measurements showed high correlation {{with each other and with}} body weight, thereby indicating that they are good indicators of body development...|$|R

40|$|Large predators are {{in decline}} {{globally}} with growing {{concerns over the}} impacts of human activity on conservation status and range of many populations. The role of trophy hunting in the conservation or decline of predators is hotly debated, though opposing views are often poorly supported by empirical evidence. Nevertheless an understanding of effects of trophy hunting on populations and behaviour {{is critical to the}} conservation of large carnivore populations. The impacts of trophy hunting on African lion population demographics, social structure and spatial behaviour were investigated in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, from 1999 to 2012, a period characterized by different trophy hunting intensities. Adult males were primarily targeted by trophy hunters, but survival of <b>all</b> <b>age</b> and sex classes were lowest when male lion off-takes were highest. Reduction in hunting quotas over the study period resulted in a 62 % increase in the total population and a 200 % increase in adult male density. Adult sex ratios were highly skewed towards females when hunting was intense. Intensity of hunting affected male and female home-range size, which declined in periods of low hunting corresponding to increases in adult males and male coalitions. Trophy hunting on the park boundary exerted a measurable edge effect with lower survival for <b>animals</b> of <b>all</b> <b>age</b> and sex classes living on the park boundary compared to those distant from it. This study provides evidence for negative impacts of uncontrolled trophy hunting on lion population and behaviour. However, limited, well regulated quotas may be compatible with large carnivore conservation...|$|R
