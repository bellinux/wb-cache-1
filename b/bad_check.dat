25|$|Since 2008, Wynn {{has been}} in a dispute with Girls Gone Wild {{producer}} Joe Francis. In 2011, a Nevada district attorney prosecuted Francis for writing a <b>bad</b> <b>check</b> to cover a $2 million gambling debt owed to Wynn, but the judge dismissed the case for falling outside the six-month statute of limitations. Wynn collected the debt in a separate civil case. In response to the collection, Francis stated that Wynn threatened to kill him, prompting Wynn to file suit for defamation against Francis. In February 2012, Clark County, Nevada, judge Mark Denton ruled that Francis damaged the reputation of Wynn and awarded Wynn $7.5 million in damages. In September 2012, after Francis repeated the alleged threat on television and Wynn added a second defamation claim, a jury awarded Wynn $40 million in compensatory and punitive damages, much more than the original $12 million Wynn's party had demanded. The judgement was amended to $19 million, after Wynn failed to prove that Francis could pay the original amount.|$|E
500|$|After {{drifting}} {{with college}} friends {{through a few}} jobs for which she did not feel she was well-suited, Marjory Stoneman met Kenneth Douglas in 1914. She {{was so impressed with}} his manners and surprised at the attention he showed her that she married him within three months. He portrayed himself as a newspaper editor, and was 30years her senior, but the marriage quickly failed when it became apparent he was a con artist. The true extent of his duplicity Marjory did not entirely reveal, despite her honesty in all other manners. Marjory may have unwittingly married Douglas while he was already married to another woman. While he spent six months in jail for passing a <b>bad</b> <b>check,</b> she remained faithful to him. However, his scheme to scam her absent father out of money worked in Marjory's favor when it attracted Frank Stoneman's attention. Marjory's uncle persuaded her to move to Miami and for the marriage to end. In the fall of 1915, Marjory Stoneman Douglas left New England to be reunited with her father, whom she had not seen since her parents' separation when she was six years old. Shortly before that time, her father had remarried Lillius ("Lilla") Eleanor Shine, whose great-great grandfather was Thomas Jefferson. (Her grandfather was Francis W. Eppes.) Marjory later wrote that Lilla Shine [...] "remained my first and best friend all my life in Florida." ...|$|E
