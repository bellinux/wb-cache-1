5|$|One of {{the most}} {{extensively}} studied cerebellar learning tasks is the eyeblink conditioning paradigm, in which a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) such as a tone or a light is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US), such as an air puff, that elicits a <b>blink</b> response. After such repeated presentations of the CS and US, the CS will eventually elicit a <b>blink</b> before the US, a conditioned response or CR. Experiments showed that lesions localized either to a specific part of the interposed nucleus (one of the deep cerebellar nuclei) or to a few specific points in the cerebellar cortex would abolish learning of a conditionally timed <b>blink</b> response. If cerebellar outputs are pharmacologically inactivated while leaving the inputs and intracellular circuits intact, learning takes place even while the animal fails to show any response, whereas, if intracerebellar circuits are disrupted, no learning takes place—these facts taken together make a strong case that the learning, indeed, occurs inside the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} games, Sonic collects golden rings, which {{protect him}} from a single hit by an enemy or obstacle, though they will scatter and <b>blink</b> before disappearing. Sonic starts {{the game with a}} limited number of lives; if he is hit with no rings in his possession, he will lose a life. If a player exhausts their lives, they will receive a game over.|$|E

40|$|The <b>blinking</b> {{patterns}} of 15 soft contact lens wearers were recorded with a concealed video camera. Each of 20 consecutive <b>blinks</b> were graded, during slow motion {{replay of the}} video, as either complete, incomplete, forced, or twitch. Ten of these subjects were instructed to perform <b>blinking</b> exercises {{for a period of}} 2 weeks and the remaining 5 subjects acted as controls. After these exercises all the experimental group displayed an increased frequency of complete <b>blinks,</b> whereas the <b>blinking</b> {{patterns of}} the control group remained unchanged. <b>Blinking</b> exercises are likely to alleviate many of the signs and symptoms associated with incomplete <b>blinking</b> amongst contact lens wearers...|$|R
5|$|The <b>Blink</b> Hacker Group, associating {{themselves}} with the Anonymous group, claimed to have hacked the Thailand prison websites and servers. The compromised data has been shared online, with the group claiming that they give the data back to Thailand Justice and the citizens of Thailand as well. The hack was done in response to news from Thailand about the mistreatment of prisoners in Thailand.|$|E
5|$|To aid with {{navigation}} and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces. These {{provide information on}} the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective <b>blink</b> reflexes to protect the eyes from damage.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, devices like a <b>blink</b> {{comparator}} {{were used}} in astronomy to detect objects in the Solar System, because these objects would move between two exposures—this involved time-consuming steps like exposing and developing photographic plates or films, and people then using a <b>blink</b> comparator to manually detect prospective objects. During the 1980s, the use of CCD-based cameras in telescopes {{made it possible to}} directly produce electronic images that could then be readily digitized and transferred to digital images. Because the CCD captured more light than film (about 90% versus 10% of incoming light) and the blinking could now be done at an adjustable computer screen, the surveys allowed for higher throughput. A flood of new discoveries was the result: over a thousand trans-Neptunian objects were detected between 1992 and 2006.|$|E

40|$|Does <b>blinking</b> {{function}} {{as a type of}} feedback in conversation? To address this question, we built a corpus of Dutch conversations, identified short and long addressee <b>blinks</b> during extended turns, and measured their occurrence relative to the end of turn constructional units (TCUs), the location where feedback typically occurs. Addressee <b>blinks</b> were indeed timed to the end of TCUs. Also, long <b>blinks</b> were more likely than short <b>blinks</b> to occur during mutual gaze, with nods or continuers, and their occurrence was restricted to sequential contexts in which signaling understanding was particularly relevant, suggesting a special signaling capacity of long <b>blinks...</b>|$|R

She said in 2011 that she chose {{emancipation}} as she was influenced by other young actors doing it. In 1997, unhappy with the roles they were being offered, Williams and several actor friends wrote a script entitled <b>Blink.</b> It was sold, but nothing happened with it.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} on an in-house 3D game engine under construction for multiple years. Each character {{is made of}} over 7000 polygons and 55 bones, making for players with facial expressions, over 800 animations, and a capacity to <b>blink.</b> Character faces can additionally express emotions like happiness or anger, and feelings of pain. The move to Xbox led to greater variation in the team personalities. The artists drew many options for each team and the developers chose from the lot. Deathrow was designed for the Action camera view, but Sports view was introduced to expand the game's appeal.|$|E

5|$|Buddha is {{the third}} and final demo by the American rock band Blink-182. Recorded and {{released}} in January 1994 under the name <b>Blink,</b> it was the band's first recording to be sold and distributed. Blink-182 was formed in Poway, California, a suburb outside of San Diego, in August 1992. Guitarist Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus were introduced to one another by Hoppus' sister. The duo recruited drummer Scott Raynor and began to practice together in his bedroom, spending hours together writing music, attending punk shows and movies and playing practical jokes. The band had recorded two previous demos in Raynor's bedroom — Flyswatter and Demo No.2 — using a four track recorder. Most of the tracks from the demo were re-recorded for their debut album Cheshire Cat.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Charles Kowal {{discovered}} 2060 Chiron, an icy planetoid with {{an orbit}} between Saturn and Uranus. He used a <b>blink</b> comparator, the same device that had allowed Clyde Tombaugh to discover Pluto nearly 50 years before. In 1992, another object, 5145 Pholus, {{was discovered in}} a similar orbit. Today, an entire population of comet-like bodies, called the centaurs, is known {{to exist in the}} region between Jupiter and Neptune. The centaurs' orbits are unstable and have dynamical lifetimes of a few million years. From the time of Chiron's discovery in 1977, astronomers have speculated that the centaurs therefore must be frequently replenished by some outer reservoir.|$|E
5|$|The Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} system was retained, having performed better than expected. The wheelchair space was made {{available on the}} end of two mid-train cars, nearest to the lifts in above-ground stations. LED displays that <b>blink</b> to warn passengers of closing doors were introduced in the upper middle section of the door. Additional loudspeakers and advertisement panels were also introduced. Hand grips were moved to the support bars of the seats on the ceiling and grabpoles were located near the doors and at both ends of each carriage. The air-conditioning system was modified to match the system used in the C751B cars, with air-conditioning vents and in-flow fans installed.|$|E
50|$|When awake, {{the lids}} spread the tear {{secretions}} over the corneal surface, {{on a typical}} basis of 2 to 10 seconds (though this may vary individually). However, <b>blinking</b> is not only dependent on dryness and/or irritation. A brain area, the globus pallidus of the basal ganglia, contains a <b>blinking</b> center that controls <b>blinking.</b> Nonetheless, the external stimuli are still involved. <b>Blinking</b> is linked with the extraocular muscles. <b>Blinking</b> is often concurrent with a shift in gaze, and {{it is believed that}} this helps the movement of the eye.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{information}} displays {{have increasingly}} conveyed visually crowded {{data in a}} multi-screen layout. Visually demanding high-density displays require the system user's cognitive process progressively more. Here <b>blinking</b> cues have played an effective role as notification to attract the viewer's immediate attention in especially urgent decision-making processes. The relationship between <b>blinking</b> cues and visual density in a multi-tasking environment has not been much studied empirically. This study examines the interaction of visual stress and distraction by <b>blinking</b> cues, with visual density of multiple graph displays and the user's multi-tasking performance with a <b>blinking</b> notification system. Unexpectedly, the user perceived higher visual stress when using the system with no-blinking cue than with <b>blinking</b> cues, in a dual-task condition used in this study, but only with low-visual-density secondary tasks. Moreover, <b>blinking</b> cues resulted in more errors during overall tasks in a dual-task environment, particularly by monitoring multiple graphs with high visual density. <b>Blinking</b> cues, however, enhanced the user's performance overall with a high density system in a dual-task situation, but <b>blinking</b> cues do not really facilitate low density secondary tasks in multi-tasking performance...|$|R
30|$|Recently, Hohng and Ha {{reported}} a <b>blinking</b> suppression in solutions of quantum dots [73]. When the individual streptavidin-coated CdSe/ZnS quantum dots were exposed in solution to β-mercaptoethanol, their <b>blinking</b> essentially disappeared and constant radiative emission was observed. The authors determined that only thiol-containing species with short chain lengths {{were able to}} suppress the quantum dot <b>blinking.</b> Since thiols are effective electron donors, the authors argued that these ligands donate electrons to fill surface traps. This deactivates the <b>blinking</b> mechanism, and leads to a more constant emission. Tinnefeld and co-workers soon after reported similar <b>blinking</b> suppression using mercaptoethylamine but interpreted their observations as {{a dramatic increase in}} the <b>blinking</b> kinetics [77]. In other words, the presence of the ligands perturbed the dynamics of the exciton. Recently, Mulvaney and co-workers were also able to modify the <b>blinking</b> dynamics in quantum dots through the variation in the choice of ligands [76].|$|R
5|$|The player {{character}} has {{three levels of}} strength. The strength level is indicated by the cursor which will either be white, flashing yellow, or red. Strength will decrease after extreme actions or being attacked by the game's enemy, Scissorman, and recovers with time. When the character's life is being threatened, the cursor will <b>blink</b> red, indicating panic mode. If the character is being chased, click points are only effective on objects that will make Scissorman retreat. In escape mode, actions do not lower strength and recovery is suspended. This mode stays active until Scissorman is somehow forced to retreat. If the player's strength reaches zero, then it is game over and the player must continue from the last room they entered with one level of strength.|$|E
5|$|Tombaugh's {{task was}} to {{systematically}} capture sections {{of the night sky}} in pairs of images. Each image in a pair was taken two weeks apart. He then placed both images of each section in a machine called a <b>blink</b> comparator, which by exchanging images quickly created a time lapse illusion of the movement of any planetary body. To reduce the chances that a faster-moving (and thus closer) object be mistaken for the new planet, Tombaugh imaged each region near its opposition point, 180 degrees from the Sun, where the apparent retrograde motion for objects beyond Earth's orbit is at its strongest. He also took a third image as a control to eliminate any false results caused by defects in an individual plate. Tombaugh decided to image the entire zodiac, rather than focus on those regions suggested by Lowell.|$|E
5|$|Tombaugh's {{task was}} to {{systematically}} image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using a <b>blink</b> comparator, he rapidly shifted {{back and forth between}} views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on January 23 and 29. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930.|$|E

5|$|By 2004, Blink-182, {{consisting}} of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, had {{emerged as the}} biggest pop punk act of the era, releasing the seven-times-multiplatinum Enema of the State (1999) and number one album Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001). The band took a brief break in 2002 when DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back, during which time he collected several darker musical ideas he felt unsuitable for Blink-182, compiling them into a record, Box Car Racer. The album, recorded {{with the help of}} Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy, was intended as a one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band with Barker behind the kit. The side project would cause great division between DeLonge and Hoppus, who was not included and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter and music on Box Car Racer edged its way into the <b>Blink</b> sound as well, and the band explored experimentalist elements on their next effort, an eponymous fifth studio album (2003). Geffen Records, after the success of Box Car Racer, offered DeLonge a solo recording deal, which he declined, feeling that it would cast a negative shadow over the band. Nevertheless, the possible deal loomed over the band, contributing to internal tension.|$|E

The Angels attack and Sally and Larry use the Yale key to hide inside the TARDIS. The Angels surround and rock the TARDIS to try to gain entry. Once in the control room, a hologram of the Doctor informs them that they have a control disk with them. Larry takes a now-glowing DVD from his pocket and inserts it into the console. The TARDIS' engines engage and the ship dematerialises, leaving a panicking Sally and Larry behind. With the TARDIS gone, the Angels who were all stood around the TARDIS have been tricked into looking at each other and have become permanently frozen as statues.|$|E

40|$|<b>Blinking</b> serves several {{functions}} in animals, {{but it comes}} {{at the cost of}} intermittent blindness. <b>Blinking</b> can occur spontaneously, but it is commonly associated with head movements. As feeding animals often need to move the head down repeatedly to gather resources, intermittent blindness might represent a hitherto unappreciated cost of feeding. In addition, this cost might also be more prevalent in larger groups as feeding effort typically increases with group size. In chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), <b>blinks</b> associated with head movements occurred at a high frequently during feeding bouts. While <b>blinks</b> tended to be short, {{the amount of time spent}} <b>blinking</b> was close to 50 % when feeding and increased with group size. By contrast, time spent <b>blinking</b> was much lower when birds simply monitored their surroundings between feeding bouts. Intermittent <b>blinking</b> at this scale when feeding is likely to decrease the ability to detect predation threats in a timely fashion and to monitor neighbors effectively...|$|R
