5|$|In 1995, Payton, {{along with}} many other investors, sought to <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> NFL {{expansion}} team to St. Louis, Missouri, and Payton expressed his interest in becoming the first minority owner in NFL history. Although the NFL strongly favored a franchise in St. Louis, their efforts were thwarted because of internal dissension among the investment group members leading the NFL to award franchises to investment groups in Jacksonville, Florida (Jacksonville Jaguars) and Charlotte, North Carolina (Carolina Panthers). St. Louis eventually received a team when the Los Angeles Rams moved to the city in 1995.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} campaign, Fletcher attempted to make the expansion of casino gambling, rather than the merit system investigation, the central issue. Beshear favored holding a referendum on {{a constitutional amendment to}} allow expanded casino gambling in the state, while Fletcher maintained that expanded gambling would <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> increase in crime and societal ills. The gambling issue failed to gain as much traction as the hiring scandal, however, and Beshear defeated Fletcher by a vote of 619,686 to 435,895.|$|E
5|$|Lochry's {{force was}} part of an army being raised by George Rogers Clark for a {{campaign}} against Detroit, the British regional headquarters. Clark, the preeminent American military leader on the northwestern frontier, worked with Governor Thomas Jefferson of Virginia in planning an expedition to capture Detroit, by which they hoped to <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> end to British support of the Indian war effort. In early August 1781, Clark and about 400 men left Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania by boat, floating down the Ohio River a few days ahead of Lochry and his men, who were trying to catch up.|$|E

5|$|Masashi Kishimoto {{developed}} {{the concept of}} jutsu in order to explain the superhuman feats that ninja performed in the Naruto series. He intended the design for the ninja in Naruto to dispel preconceived notions about ninja popularized by other manga and to <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> original take to the presentation of ninja in manga. The use of hand seals substitutes for the incantations for magic found in other sources, and {{was based on the}} motions of ninja in various role-playing games. The hand seals are based upon the characters of the Chinese zodiac, which is a longstanding tradition in Japan, and Kishimoto used them specifically to draw upon that tradition.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{to slavery}} began to {{organize}} in Indiana around 1805, and in 1809 abolitionists {{took control of}} the territorial legislature and overturned many of the laws permitting retaining of slaves. By the time Indiana was granted statehood in 1816, the abolitionists were in firm control and slavery was banned in the constitution. In 1820, an Supreme Court of Indiana ruling in Polly v. Lasselle freed all the remaining slaves in the state. An additional Supreme Court ruling in 1821 freed indentured servant Mary Bateman Clark, helping to <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> end to indentured servitude.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{was said}} to have been tall, good-looking and intelligent. Less warlike than either his father or grandfather, he sought to <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> end to the Hundred Years' War that Edward III had started. He was a firm believer in the royal prerogative, which led him to {{restrain}} the power of the aristocracy, and to rely on a private retinue for military protection instead; in contrast to the fraternal, martial court of his grandfather, he cultivated a refined atmosphere at his court, in which the king was an elevated figure, with art and culture at its centre.|$|E

This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in universal judgement of all mankind.

5|$|The episodes, {{written in}} advance {{during the fall}} of 2010, were {{conceived}} to successfully <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> end to the series. Showrunners Brian Peterson and Kelly Souders attempted to preserve the intended ending envisioned by original series developers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar several years earlier. The episodes featured the return of several former actors, including John Schneider, Aaron Ashmore, Annette O'Toole, Michael McKean (voice only), and Michael Rosenbaum. The episodes also contained several overt references, homages, and connections to previous Superman franchises, such as the 1978 film Superman and the 2006 film Superman Returns.|$|E

Irwin is a half-demon who is angry that society prevents {{him from a}} relationship with the holy leader Matilda, and seeks to destroy the world in retribution. Escad seeks to destroy Irwin, and Daena tries to act as a mediator between all parties while keeping Matilda away from Irwin. The conflict eventually escalates into a war between humans and faeries. Depending on the choices of the player, either Daena or Escad will die, while the player helps <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> end to the conflict.|$|E
5|$|After Pierce died, he mostly {{passed from}} the American consciousness, except {{as one of a}} series of presidents whose {{disastrous}} tenures led to civil war. Pierce's presidency is widely regarded as a failure; he is often described as one of the worst presidents in American history. The public placed him third-to-last among his peers in C-SPAN surveys (2000 and 2009). Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative, most disastrously with the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Although he did not lead that fight—Senator Douglas did—Pierce paid the cost in damage to his reputation. The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> end to the dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics.|$|E
5|$|Anne was ill for 15 {{months after}} the birth of her {{youngest}} son, Edgar. She bore Henrietta in 1669 and Catherine in 1671. Anne never recovered from Catherine's birth. Ill with breast cancer, she died on 31 March 1671. On her deathbed, her two brothers Henry and Laurence tried to <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> Anglican priest to give her communion, but Anne refused and she received viaticum of the Catholic Church. Two days after her death, her embalmed body was interred in the vault of Mary, Queen of Scots, at Westminster Abbey's Henry VII Chapel. In June 1671, Anne's only surviving son Edgar died of natural causes, followed by Catherine in December, leaving Mary and Anne as the Duke of York's heiresses.|$|E

5|$|By 1153, {{the castle}} {{garrison}} was running very low on food, and Roger {{made a deal}} with Stephen allowing him to leave the castle with his followers. Henry, the Empress' son and the future Henry II, then intervened, marching his forces to relieve the castle and placing Stephen's counter-castles under siege himself. King Stephen marched back from Oxford, and the two forces confronted each other on the meadows outside the castle. The result was an embryonic peace deal called the Treaty of Wallingford, leading on to the permanent Treaty of Winchester that would ultimately <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> end to the civil war and install Henry as king following Stephen's death in 1153. Brien, who had no children, chose to enter a monastery, and surrendered Wallingford Castle to Henry {{at the end of the}} conflict in 1153.|$|E
5|$|During the Qin dynasty, {{the first}} Qin emperor's {{legitimacy}} to rule was ultimately decided by {{his ability to}} conquer others. However, {{by the time of}} Wang Mang's (r. 9–23 AD) reign, the Mandate of Heaven was considered the only legitimate source of imperial authority. This concept was given greater prominence after the state officially sponsored the worship of Heaven over that of the Five Powers in 31 BC. Moreover, the philosophy of the scholar Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC), which held that a dynasty's rule on earth was bound to greater cosmological cycles in the universe, was officially sponsored by the Han court from Emperor Wu's (r. 141–87 BC) reign onward. The emperor was expected to behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, lest he incur the wrath of Heaven and <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> end to his reign. He became the highest priest in the land. By performing certain religious rites and rituals, the emperor acted as a sacred link between Heaven and Earth.|$|E
5|$|French-led {{international}} intervention {{ended the}} civil war and order was restored by 1861. Shahin's movement was in a precarious state in the war's aftermath; Shahin could not financially support his impoverished peasant partisans, the Maronite clergy was disillusioned with him, and Ottoman officialdom and the local nobility were arrayed against him. The Ottomans, the clergy and the nobility resolved to <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> end to Shahin's movement because it represented the last obstacle to their political reorganization of Mount Lebanon into the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate. Shahin threatened to convert to Protestantism together with his partisans if the Khazen sheikhs were restored to Keserwan, while Patriarch Massad of the Maronite Church was prepared to excommunicate Shahin and his supporters.|$|E

5|$|In {{the appeal}} against Prakash J.'s {{judgment}} to the Court of Appeal, also called Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts (1996), {{counsel for the}} appellants argued that the restriction placed by the Minister on the importation, sale and distribution of the Jehovah's Witnesses publications was too wide and disproportionate. Applying an approach similar to that taken in Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994), the Court of Appeal noted that the appellants were essentially seeking to challenge the view taken by the Minister that Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to carry out National Service {{was a threat to}} national security. The Court regarded this as a non-justiciable issue and declined to allow the appellants to <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> application for judicial review of Order No. 405/1995.|$|E
5|$|It {{was found}} that Choor Singh had two private {{contacts}} with a material witness {{in the course of}} the disciplinary proceedings, even though it is a well-established rule that a decision-maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings or any of his witnesses in the absence of the other party or his counsel. The High Court found that there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh might or could not <b>bring</b> <b>an</b> unprejudiced mind to the disciplinary inquiry. The key finding was that the two private contacts with the material witness gave an appearance of a real likelihood of bias. On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E

In 1807, Lord Minto, Governor General of India, determined to send ambassadors to the Sikh Empire, Afghanistan and Persia {{in an effort to}} secure their support and prevent the French from gaining allies on India's western borders. As part of this diplomatic campaign, the ambassador to Persia was instructed to discuss the problem with the Persian government, but due to French influence in Tehran, he was unable to obtain any guarantees.|$|E
