They find that regression results support the findings of Jared Diamond and David Landes that factor endowments influence GDP per capita. However, Easterly and Levine's findings most support the view that long-lasting institutions most shape economic development outcomes. Relevant institutions include private property rights and the rule of law.|$|E

25|$|Held {{that the}} Constitution of India which is {{essentially}} a social rather than a political document, is founded on a social philosophy and as such has two main features basic and circumstantial. The basic constituent remained constant, the circumstantial was subject to change. According to the learned Judges, the broad contours of the basic elements and the fundamental features of the Constitution are delineated in the preamble and the Parliament has no power to abolish or emasculate those basic elements of fundamental features. The building of a welfare State is {{the ultimate goal of}} every Government <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that in order to build a welfare State, human freedoms have to suffer a total destruction. Applying these tests, the learned Judges invalidated Article 31C even in its un-amended form.|$|E
25|$|In Morocco, where king Mohammed VI is also Amir al-Muminin (Commander of the Faithful), the {{authorities}} {{have tried to}} organize the field by creating a scholars' council (conseil des oulémas) composed of Muslim scholars (ulama), {{which is the only}} one allowed to issue fatāwā. In this case, a national theocracy could in fact compel intra-national compliance with the fatwā, since a central authority is the source. Even then, however, the issue would not necessarily be religiously binding for the residents of that nation. For, the state may have the power to put a fatwā in effect, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that the fatwā is to be religiously accepted by all. For instance, if a state fatwā council made abortion acceptable in the first trimester without any medical reason, that would have direct impact on official procedures in hospitals and courts in that country. Yet, this would not mean that the Muslims in that nation has to agree with that fatwā, or that the fatwā is religiously binding for them.|$|E

[...] McCain lost the Virginia primary on February 29, and on March 7 lost nine of the thirteen primaries on Super Tuesday to Bush. With little hope of overcoming Bush's delegate lead, McCain withdrew from the race on March 9, 2000. He endorsed Bush two months later, and made occasional appearances with the Texas governor during the general election campaign.|$|E

Aware of this perception, Reinfeldt has said [...] "I am by nature confident and calm. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> I am not passionate and wouldn't feel strongly about things."

500|$|Dumville, {{commenting on}} these {{attempts}} {{to establish the}} historicity of the poem in 1988, said, [...] "The case for authenticity, whatever exactly we mean by that, is not proven; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that it cannot be." [...] Likewise, Patrick Sims-Williams concluded in 2016 that, 'evaluating the supposed proofs that poems in the Books of Aneirin and Taliesin cannot {{go back to the}} sixth century, we have found them either to be incorrect or to apply to only a very few lines or stanzas that may be explained as additions. It seems impossible to prove, however, that any poem must go back to the sixth century linguistically and cannot be a century or more later'. The fact that the great majority of the warriors mentioned in the poem are not known from other sources has been put forward by several authors as an argument against the idea that the poem could be a later composition. The poems which are known to be later [...] "forgeries" [...] have clearly been written for a purpose, for example to strengthen the claims of a particular dynasty. The men commemorated in Y Gododdin do not appear in the pedigrees of any Welsh dynasty. Breeze comments, [...] "it is difficult to see why a later poet should take the trouble to commemorate men who, but for the poem, would be forgotten".|$|E
500|$|When {{originally}} used in Olney, it {{is unknown}} what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune [...] "Hephzibah" [...] by English composer John Jenkins Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable {{with a variety of}} tunes; more than twenty musical settings of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named [...] "New Britain", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies ("Gallaher" [...] and [...] "St. Mary") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy [...] "the wants of the Church in her triumphal march". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but [...] "Gallaher" [...] and [...] "St. Mary" [...] had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin. A manuscript from 1828 by Lucius Chapin, a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to [...] "St. Mary", <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that he wrote it.|$|E
