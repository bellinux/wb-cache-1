6000|$|The Ink {{has already}} been spoken of. The more fluid it is the better, {{so long as it}} does not [...] "run." [...] A thick ink cannot be so thinned by adding turpentine, etc., as to make it equal to ink that was {{originally}} fluid. The variety of oils used in making ink, and of the added materials, is endless. For our purpose, any oil that dries and does not spread, such as boiled or burnt linseed oil, mixed with lampblack, is almost all that is wanted. The <b>burnt</b> <b>oil</b> is the thicker of the two, and dries the faster. Unfortunately the two terms, burnt and boiled linseed oil, have no definite meaning in the trade, boiling or burning not being the simple processes these words express, but including an admixture of drying materials, which differ with each manufacturer; moreover, there are two, if not three, fundamentally distinct qualities of linseed, in respect to the oil extracted from it. The ink used in the laboratory and described above, answers all requirements. Many other inks have suited less well; less even than that which can be made, in a very homely way, with a little soot off a plate that had been smoked over a candle, mixed with such boiled linseed oil as can be bought at unpretentious oil and colour shops, its only fault being a tendency to run.|$|E

50|$|Rotaries had {{a number}} of disadvantages, notably very high fuel consumption, {{partially}} because the engine was typically run at full throttle, and also because the valve timing was often less than ideal. Oil consumption was also very high. Due to primitive carburetion and absence of a true sump, the lubricating oil was added to the fuel/air mixture. This made engine fumes heavy with smoke from partially <b>burnt</b> <b>oil.</b> Castor oil was the lubricant of choice, as its lubrication properties were unaffected by the presence of the fuel, and its gum-forming tendency was irrelevant in a total-loss lubrication system.

40|$|Although occupying just 3 - 4 % of the world&rsquo;s landmass {{covering}} temperate, boreal {{and tropical}} areas, peatlands {{play an important}} role in conserving biodiversity and as a carbon sink. Current intensification of agricultural activities, especially in tropical areas, has led to increased use of tropical peatlands such as those in Indonesia. There is currently only limited information on the impact of this conversion. This project aimed to examine the effect of agricultural and restoration practices on the physico-chemical characteristics together with the activity and diversity of the microbial community present in tropical peat swamp soils. In addition, the impact of peat swamp restoration on microbial communities was also evaluated in an effort to monitor the success of the restoration process. To achieve this, analyses of physical, chemical and biological characteristics coupled with molecular biological analyses of peat swamp soils exposed to different human practices was carried out within the Giam Siak Kecil &ndash; Bukit Batu (GSKBB) Biosphere Reserve, Riau &ndash; Indonesia. The first component of this study examined the impact of oil palm (burning and without burning) and rubber plantations (5 - 10 and &gt; 40 years old) on both the biotic and abiotic properties of the peatland soil through comparisons with soil from a natural forest. Based on analysis of the physico-chemical properties, soils from plantations demonstrated increased decomposition rates, as shown by a reduction in soil organic matter (4 - 18 %), an increase in bulk density (&rho;b) (0. 08 &ndash; 0. 17 g cm- 3) and an increase in bacterial biomass (0. 6 &ndash; 5. 9 fold) compared with natural forest peat soils. Moreover, drier conditions due to plantation management in peat swamp soil were found, with deeper water tables (45 &ndash; 67 cm) and reduced soil water holding capacities (22 - 53 % reduction). However, community level physiological profiling (CLPP) showed impaired microbial community function only in soils from oil palm plantations. Oil palm plantation soil (without burning) showed the lowest microbial activities (50 % decrease) and the lowest Shannon diversity values (2. 90) compared to natural forest soils. In contrast, soil from young rubber plantations exhibited increased microbial activities (54 %) and similar Shannon diversity values (3. 13) compared to natural forest soils. The second part of this study involved further assessment of the impact of oil palm and rubber plantations on tropical peatland soils using a polyphasic approach involving biochemical and molecular microbial assays. The concentration of ammonium, nitrate and phosphate observed in agricultural soils indicated a substantial increase compared with natural forest. These changes were accompanied by changes in the soil enzyme activity; reduced activities of &beta;-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase and acid phosphatase activities (50 &ndash; 55 % reduction) were detected in agricultural soils while increased chitinase activity was detected in the rubber plantation soil (37 % increase). In terms of soil microbial community diversity, PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) based analysis showed that the soil bacterial community from agricultural soils exhibited the lowest similarity amongst the different microbial groups (bacteria, fungi and archaea) evaluated, showing only 34 % similarity to the natural forest soil. The Shannon diversity index values further confirmed that the conversion of tropical peatland natural forest to agriculture resulted in the greatest impact on microbial diversity being significantly different compared with the natural forest. Overall, this study indicated substantial shifts in soil microbial activity and diversity occured upon conversion of natural peatland forest to agricultural areas. The final stage of the study investigated the restoration process of <b>burnt</b> <b>oil</b> palm plantation through revegetation with native peat swamp forest plants and land rewetting through assessment of the activity and diversity of the soil microbial community together with soil chemical and physical characterisation. Overall, the physical-chemical characteristics of the restoration soils remained similar to the soil from the <b>burnt</b> <b>oil</b> palm plantation with increased depth of water table (5 - 6 times deeper), reduced water holding capacity (23 - 35 %), increased bulk density (&rho;b) (0. 31 &ndash;. 32 g cm- 3), an increase the C:N ratio (41 : 1) and higher ammonium and nitrate concentrations (4 - 17 times higher) when compared to the forest soil (p&lt; 0. 05). Restoration, involving revegetation and land rewetting resulted in a significant decrease in the phosphate concentration of the restoration soils (4. 722 mg kg- 1) (p&lt; 0. 05) compared with other soil samples. In terms of microbial diversity, PCR-DGGE revealed that the bacterial community of the restoration soil changed significantly (only 10 % similarity), amongst the different microbial groups (fungal and archaeal communities). Principal Component Analyses (PCA) showed all three soil samples clustered individually with different dependent parameters. Overall, after 3. 5 years of restoration, the degraded <b>burnt</b> <b>oil</b> palm plantation soils did not appear to be similar to the peat swamp natural forest soil. Overall, this thesis contributes to our understanding of the impact of agricultural practices, especially oil palm and rubber plantations, on the microbial activity and diversity in tropical peat swamp soil. In addition, soil microbial ecology was found to be a useful indicator for use in the monitoring of the restoration process. Periodic analyses of soils under restoration using molecular microbial techniques are suggested as a useful tool for monitoring the success of the restoration process...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to discover a new filtering media, specifically for pathogenic microorganism removal for the water treatment industry to produce safe drinking water. Granular bed filtration was used in this study as a healthy, simple and economical method to prevent the penetration of bacterial contamination. Alternative filter media from local source namely the <b>burnt</b> <b>oil</b> palm shell (BOPS) was also introduced. In order to determine the BOPS performance, the experimental programme and research approach used in this study were the design and construction of filtration unit, preparation of filter media, determination distribution size, morphology, porosity and specific gravity of filter media and also physical and biological analysis of filtrate water. In addition, total coliform and Escherichia coli tests of filtrate water in single-, dual- and tri-media filter were also investigated. Physical properties of BOPS were found to be equivalent or superior to those commercialized available granular filter media with ball-pan hardness of 97. 30 %. Granular media filter with mix media classes (which is a dual-media filtration) is also found to be a reliable surrogate for physical removal and biological barrier during filtration studies. Dual-media filtration BOPS/sand ES 1. 0 / 0. 5 mm is operating optimum condition of removing 80. 77 % of turbidity, 76. 23 % of suspended solid, 59. 45 % of colour and for bacteriological 0. 63 log and 0. 46 log of removal for total coliform and Escherichia coli. There was statistically significance difference between types of media filter to the removal of physical variable at 0. 05 level as determined by one-way anova for the turbidity % removal (p = 0. 000), suspended solid % removal (p = 0. 000) and colour % removal (p = 0. 000). Under one-factor analysis, there was a statistically significant difference for dual-media filtration for Escherichia coli removal (p = 0. 001), but not significant for single- and tri-media filter. Both Tukey HSD and Scheffe post hoc analysis revealed that BOPS/Sand: 1. 0 / 0. 5 mm significantly higher log of removal by compared to commercial filter media anthracite/sand. The study also identified that energy losses were correspondingly to the porosity and shape factor value of media filter. Moreover, lower diameter grain size resulted in higher energy losses. The BOPS was identified as a potential filter media that can help in reducing the cost of water treatment and enhancing environmental sustainability. Thus, the final result of this study has found that BOPS {{can be used as a}} new biodegradable medium filter in water treatment process specifically for the removal of pathogenic microorganism...|$|E
40|$|The large calanoid copepods Calanus glacialis and C. ﬁnmarchicus {{is a key}} {{link between}} primary {{producers}} and higher trophic levels in Arctic marine ecosystems being used as indicator species of respective Arctic and Atlantic water. In this study, the egg production successand population development of Calanus glacialis and C. finmarchicus were studied in Isfjorden, Svalbard, from February to August 2016. An experimental study, investigating potential effects of different oil spill clean-up methods on C. glacialis reproduction was also conducted to study the fate of Calanus spp, under different environmental stressors. The two Calanus species had similarly large populations in Isfjorden in winter and entered the surface water simultaneously in late winter-spring. Their reproductive strategy diﬀered althoughs. C. glacialis started to produce eggs earlier than C. finmarchicus and had a clear egg production maximum {{at the peak of}} the spring bloom that dropped to a minimum soon after the bloom.. C. ﬁnmarchicus had a a modest, stable egg production over a relatively long time span from early May to July. The late spawned eggs, however, did not make it, resulting in lower recruitment of C. finmarchicus than C. glacialis in Isfjorden in 2016. Transformed Atlantic water prevailed in Isfjorden in 2016 and there were no strong evidence of major advective events from February to August. The increase in population numbers in June was thus mainly due to local recruitment, which also the timing of the egg production and the surface temperatures supported. C. glacialis timed its reproduction and population development more successfully than C. finmarchicus to the prevailing abiotic and biotic environment in Isfjorden. By the end of August, C. glacialis had reached its main overwintering stage and was already concentrated at depth. In comparison, C. finmarchicus had a biomodal vertical distribution end of August with still high numbers of young developmental stages in the surface. In the oil exposure experiment dispersant, residue from <b>burnt</b> <b>oil</b> and crude oil were added to the mesocosms placed in seasonal sea ice in Van Mijenfjorden, Svalbard,in February 2015. In May 2015, C. glacialis females were incubated in water from these mesocosms. Because of large variation in the data partly due to overall low egg production rates, no signiﬁcant eﬀect of the diﬀerent treatments on the reproduction success and development was found., However several of the nauplii from the dispersant treatment showed sign of deformation and reduced survival. In a changing Arctic with less ice, warmer temperatures and more activity, multiole stressors will together impact the marine ecosystem.
