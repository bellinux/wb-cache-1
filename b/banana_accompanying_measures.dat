50|$|The European Union has {{traditionally}} imported {{many of its}} bananas from former European Caribbean colonies, paying guaranteed prices above global market rates (see Lomé Convention). These arrangements have now been largely withdrawn under pressure from other major trading powers, principally the United States. The withdrawal of these indirect subsidies to Caribbean producers is expected to favour the more efficient banana producers of Central America, in which American companies have an economic interest. In addition, small-scale Caribbean producers are finding it difficult to comply with increasingly strict certification requirements. Some support is being provided to Caribbean countries under the EU's <b>Banana</b> <b>Accompanying</b> <b>Measures</b> (BAM).|$|E
40|$|Ten ACP {{countries}} that ship bananas to the European Union should {{benefit from the}} third support plan {{set up by the}} EU since 1994. Three of the sources are in Africa and seven in Caribbean. The BAM (<b>Banana</b> <b>Accompanying</b> <b>Measures)</b> are to cover the period 20102013 with funding of EUR 190 million. It takes over from the SFA (Special Framework of Assistance) that ran until the end of 2008.

40|$|While {{cooking and}} brewing bananas are produced, {{consumed}} and traded in ACP countries, the dessert banana, Cavendish, is the predominant variety for international trade. Despite high production levels in Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi (mainly for local consumption) and a well established export market in Dominican Republic, Côte d’Ivoire and Cameroon (mainly to the EU market), {{the trade in}} dessert bananas is still dominated by Latin America. This Executive Brief presents the main developments of the banana market at global, EU and ACP levels, with special emphasis on the implications for ACP producers. As highlighted in the Brief, the Geneva Banana Trade Agreement (GBTA), the implementation of previously agreed free trade agreements (FTAs) and new FTAs (e. g. with India), and the budgetary constraints for the extension of EU <b>banana</b> <b>accompanying</b> <b>measures</b> (BAM) support are likely to threaten ACP banana export. However, new opportunities exist for ACP producers, {{such as the use}} of refrigerated containers in the supply chain, the growing demand for certified organic and fair trade bananas, and new market opportunities for processed added-value banana products such as flour and flour products...|$|E

40|$|Odra {{river is}} {{extremely}} polluted by organic matter, nitrates, ammonia, phosphorus, bacteria, particles, heavy metals and other micro pollutants from municipalities, industries and agriculture. The poor water quality severely affects the ecology and represents {{a risk to}} human health. The water has a very limited value of use. This report presents an abatement programme with both technical and <b>accompanying</b> <b>measures.</b> In order to identify the major polluters several multi criteria analysis have been developed, discussed and evaluated. Technical measures for 23 "Hot spots" are proposed and ranked according to the cost/benefit ratio. Measures for agriculture {{have been based on}} previous work. The proposed abatement programme gives a significant reduction of the total pollution discharges in the region, and improves both local and regional water quality. The abatement programme will also contribute to the Czech Government's obligations to reduce the pollution to the Baltic Sea. <b>Accompanying</b> <b>measures</b> (policy, administrative including legal and economic measures) have been addressed in detail.

40|$|In Italy {{there are}} more than 500 000 {{building}} companies, employing on average three workers each. The companies face difficulties to keep up to date with legal provisions, due to their small size. European, national and regional legislation need a number of <b>accompanying</b> <b>measures</b> in order to be implemented effectively. Municipal administrations are over 8000 and have frequent contacts with the building companies. Furthermore the municipalities have the responsibility on town planning schemes and on building codes that for example regulate aesthetics and hygiene standards, and more recently may include specific energy efficiency standards and norms. Starting in 2003 a number of successful local experiences have been implemented, especially in Lombardia and in the Milan Province, where the practices of the building companies have been permanently modified. The pilot experience of some early adopter municipalities has spread, currently involving around 100 municipalities. Best practices show the effectiveness of monitoring activities in the construction sites and of incisive <b>accompanying</b> <b>measures</b> (training and information, technical support, focused economic incentives). In this perspective, the successful establishment of improved building codes is not intended as a mere approval of a new piece of legislation.

30|$|This {{group is}} called {{autonomous}} or excluded enablers. These enablers {{have only a}} few links with the system. They appear quite out of line with the system. However, a distinction may be drawn within this group between the disconnected enablers situated near the axis's origin, whose evolution therefore seems to be rather excluded from the system's global dynamics and secondary levers which, although quite autonomous, are more influent than dependent. These enablers concerned are located in the south-west frame, quite above the diagonal, and can be used as secondary acting enablers or as application points for possible <b>accompanying</b> <b>measures.</b> In the present study, none of the barriers is coming under this category.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyses}} the E 3 (economy-energy-environment) {{impacts of}} a domestic emissions trading regime in Austria for 8 manufacturing industries and the electricity generation sector by 2010. The trading regime leads to compliance with the Austrian Kyoto target of minus 13 % until 2010 for these sectors. Due to inter-fuel substitution, fossil energy is crowded out by electricity in manufacturing with a carbon leakage to electricity generation. In liberalised markets, domestic thermal electricity generation is substituted by imports due to higher electricity prices, i. e., carbon leaks abroad. These carbon leakages can be overcome by <b>accompanying</b> <b>measures</b> to stimulate renewable electricity generation. The macroeconomic and sectoral effects of the emissions trading mainly depend on the allocation mechanism applied...|$|R
