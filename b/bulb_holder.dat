25|$|Within Europe, when {{driving a}} vehicle with right-traffic {{headlamps}} in a left-traffic country {{or vice versa}} for a limited time (as for example on vacation or in transit), it is a legal requirement to adjust the headlamps temporarily so that their wrong-side beam distribution does not dazzle oncoming drivers. This may be achieved by methods including adhering opaque decals or prismatic lenses to a designated part of the lens. Some projector-type headlamps {{can be made to}} produce a proper left- or right-traffic beam by shifting a lever or other movable element in or on the lamp assembly. Many tungsten (pre-halogen) European-code headlamps made in France by Cibié, Marchal, and Ducellier could be adjusted to produce either a left- or a right-traffic low beam by means of a two-position <b>bulb</b> <b>holder.</b>|$|E
25|$|The H1 lamp was {{the first}} tungsten-halogen {{headlamp}} light source. It was introduced in 1962 by a consortium of European bulb and headlamp makers. This bulb has a single axial filament that consumes 55 watts at 12.0 volts, and produces 1550 lumens ±15% when operated at 13.2V. H2 (55W @ 12.0V, 1820lm @ 13.2V) followed in 1964, and the transverse-filament H3 (55W @ 12.0V, 1450lm ±15%) in 1966. H1 still sees wide use in low beams, high beams and auxiliary fog and driving lamps, as does H3. The H2 {{is no longer a}} current type, since it requires an intricate <b>bulb</b> <b>holder</b> interface to the lamp, has a short life and is difficult to handle. For those reasons, H2 was withdrawn from ECE Regulation 37 for use in new lamp designs (though H2 bulbs are still manufactured for replacement purposes in existing lamps), but H1 and H3 remain current and these two bulbs were legalised in the United States in 1993. More recent single-filament bulb designs include the H7 (55W @ 12.0V, 1500lm ±10% @ 13.2V), H8 (35W @ 12.0V, 800lm ±15% @ 13.2V), H9 (65W @ 12.0V, 2100lm ±10% @ 13.2V), and H11 (55W @ 12.0V, 1350lm ±10% @ 13.2V). 24-volt versions of many bulb types are available for use in trucks, buses, and other commercial and military vehicles.|$|E
500|$|The Marie Antoinette Suite is {{accessed}} {{from the}} main restaurant. According to Marcus Binney [...] "the gilded detail of the room has the lustre and crispness of gilt bronze, even the egg-and-dart in the boldly modelled cornice". Floral motifs are a common feature of the room, given the namesake, Marie Antoinette, and represents the flowers at one of her feasts. Over the overmantel is a basket of flowers, with [...] "flowers spilling out over the frames of the oval lunettes". [...] In the small entrance lobby of the suite are two terracotta statues of Spring and Summer, with [...] "drum-shaped pedestals ornamented with gilt-bronze flowers and ribbons". The ventilation grilles, of considerable size, are decorated in bronzed lattice. On the walls are a series lamp holders held by miniature Apollo lyres, with each <b>bulb</b> <b>holder</b> containing around 25 leaves opened out. The lights, according to Binney, are hung on [...] "cords from ribbons tied in bows, entwined at intervals with flowers, descending to a cluster of tassels". [...] The panels of the walls are treated like picture frames, with inner and outer mouldings, {{in contrast to the}} window frames and the wall mirrors which are surrounded by [...] "clusters of reeds, with an inset behind which a curtain could hang without obscuring the moulding", according to Binney.|$|E
50|$|Men {{traditionally}} earned {{money for}} the family by agriculture and making charcoal. In the past, Mazahua communities were self-sufficient, but {{that is no longer}} the case. The economy of most Mazahua families has been shifting away from agriculture to integration into the wider Mexican economy. One major example is the employment of Mazahuas at a former ranch called Pastejé, near Atlacomulco, now known for its electrical appliance factory. The plant began employing Mazahuas, primarily women, to do assembly work to produce electricity, water meters, conductors, <b>bulb</b> <b>holders,</b> and more. In December 1964, another plant opened and hired about 700 young women.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a gear {{shifting}} mechanism {{was designed and}} applied to make the shifting process faster and less destructible for the driver. The new device must be reliable, has a small dimensions, low construction and maintenance cost. This paper aims to improve {{gear shifting}} process using devices as: a manual four speed gear box, four pneumatic double acting cylinders, four pneumatic two position five ways directional control valves, Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) LOGO unit, an electrical motor, an electrical clutch, a belt, two pulleys, limit switches, push buttons, <b>bulbs,</b> a table (<b>holder)</b> and power supply. According to suggested gear_ shifting method the driver can select the transmission gear ratio without moving his hands from the steering wheel by putting the gear shifting push buttons on the steering wheel. Using this method leaves to the driver the excitement of choosing the shifting moment...|$|R
50|$|The {{new model}} of SP5, Mk2 1335, {{produced}} since 2000, has several differences from the Mk1. The whole layout of this model has been changed. The positions of the components are in reverse, the cylinders and chimney {{are now on the}} lefthand side for example. Also, the lefthand end of the crankshaft has the usual counterweight type of crank as on the SP5 Mk1, SE3 Twin and other engines, but the righthand end of the new SP5 Mk2's crankshaft has a more efficient and far more attractive crankdisc for better balance and smoother running. Furthermore, this engine has one-piece cylinders; the bore being 8 mm (5/16 inch), and stroke 19 mm (3/4 inch). The SP5D Mk2 model comes fitted with a belt-driven dynamo and <b>bulb</b> <b>holder.</b> A version without the dynamo is also available.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the company}} grew the product {{categories}} diversified. There are three possibilities how designs made by Porsche Design can appear — Porsche Design brand products made exclusively for Porsche Design; products bearing the manufacturer's {{name and the}} writing [...] "Design by F.A. Porsche"; and products with no hint of Porsche Design at all. Porsche Design came up with several bathroom designs, a washing machine, furniture, knives, television receivers, desk lamps (one with three telescoping radio antennas attaching the light <b>bulb</b> <b>holder</b> to the base and one employing design aspects of a guillotine in its pull-out mechanism), tobacco pipes with air-cooled-engine-inspired cooling fins, pens made out of wire-cloth used in oil hoses for racing engines, computer monitors, computer external hard drives, coffee makers, and even a grand piano for an Austrian manufacturer Bösendorfer. The Design by F.A. Porsche mark is used no more, {{with the exception of}} the professional kitchen knives of CHROMA Cnife.|$|E

In 1992, the Americans created their own standard for a bulb called HB2: almost identical to H4 except with more stringent constraints on filament geometry and positional variance, and power consumption and light output expressed at the US test voltage of 12.8V.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{develop a}} reliable, {{inexpensive}} device for teaching ocular surgical procedures and practicing experimental techniques on enucleated eyes. Design: Teaching device trial. Methods: A Plexiglas ocular <b>bulb</b> <b>holder</b> was secured with its base support to a polyvinylchloride pillar on a modified polystyrene trial head. Results: This model allows curvilinear capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification of porcine lenses through a corneal tunnel incision and insertion of a soft foldable acrylic intraocular lens into the capsular bag. Argon and neodymium:YAG laser iridotomy and retinal argon laser photocoagulation {{can also be}} performed with this model. Conclusion: This inexpensive device is useful for teaching both surgical and laser ocular procedures...|$|E
