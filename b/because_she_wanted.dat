Maciunas admired and promoted her work enthusiastically and gave Ono her U.S. show at his AG Gallery in 1961. He formally invited her to join the Fluxus group, but she declined <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to remain independent. She did, however, collaborate with him, Charlotte Moorman, George Brecht, and the poet Jackson Mac Low, among others associated with the group.|$|E
5|$|While in England, Godwin took {{a course}} in {{creative}} writing at the City Literature Institute, where she met her second husband, psychiatrist Ian Marshall. They were married two months later. The marriage was brief and they were divorced in 1966. After their breakup, Godwin returned to the United States. At age 29, she {{took a job as}} fact-checker in New York City for The Saturday Evening Post. She said the job was embarrassing, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to be a writer, as opposed to fact-checking the work of others.|$|E
5|$|Molly {{lost her}} {{championship}} to Victoria in a Four-Way Elimination match on February 23, 2004. The feud {{led to a}} Hair versus Title match at WrestleMania XX in March 2004, which Molly lost, resulting in her having her head shaved. Greenwald maintains {{that it was her}} idea to have her head shaved, suggesting the idea to Vince McMahon months before the match occurred <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to do something shocking at WrestleMania. Over the next few months, in storyline, she desperately tried to disguise her bald head using loose-fitting wigs. Later in 2004, Molly feuded with Stacy Keibler, overpowering Stacy on the mat and pinning her in three consecutive occasions, the last one occurring in a number one contender's match.|$|E

Rumpelstiltskin tells her it belonged to his son whom he unfortunately lost along with his wife. Gaston arrives to take Belle back but Rumpelstiltskin turns him into a rose and presents it to her as a gift. When asked about Gaston, Belle says that it was an arranged marriage, not one of love. She left him <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to be heroic and there are not many chances for women to be heroic. Rumpelstiltskin asks Belle to go into town to buy more straw, and she cannot believe he trusts her to come back. Rumpelstiltskin says he does not expect to see her again.|$|E
5|$|When {{serialization}} began, Kishimoto {{decided the}} ending would feature {{a fight between}} two characters: Naruto and Sasuke, which would end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato. Kishimoto chose Hinata Hyuga as Naruto's romantic partner from {{the early stages of}} the manga, since Hinata had always respected Naruto even before the series' beginning, and Kishimoto felt this meant the two of them could build a relationship. This decision annoyed his wife <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> Naruto to marry Sakura Haruno, but Kishimoto viewed Sakura as Naruto's friend and teammate, rather than a future wife. When Hinata first appeared, Kishimoto thought of forming a love triangle among the three characters, but because he decided that fighting was the main focus of the manga, there was little room for romantic plotlines.|$|E
5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E

5|$|During the turmoil, Harald {{was arrested}} and imprisoned, but the sources {{disagree}} on the grounds. The sagas state that Harald was arrested for defrauding the emperor of his treasure, {{as well as for}} requesting marriage with an apparently fictional niece or granddaughter of Zoe, called Maria (his suit supposedly being turned down by the empress <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to marry Harald herself). William of Malmesbury states that Harald was arrested for defiling a noble woman, while according to Saxo Grammaticus he was imprisoned for murder. DeVries suggests that the new emperor may have feared Harald because of his loyalty to the previous emperor. The sources also disagree on how Harald got out of prison, but he may have been helped by someone outside to escape {{in the midst of the}} revolt that had begun against the new emperor. While some of the Varangians helped guard the emperor, Harald became the leader of the Varangians who supported the revolt. The emperor was in the end dragged out of his sanctuary, blinded and exiled to a monastery, and the sagas claim that it was Harald himself who blinded Michael V (or at least claimed to have done so).|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Holloway's missed flight, Jug and Beth Twitty {{and friends}} flew to Aruba by private jet. Within {{four hours of}} landing on the island, the Twittys presented the Aruban police with {{the name and address}} of Van der Sloot as the person with whom Holloway left the nightclub. Beth stated that Van der Sloot's full name was given to her by the night manager at the Holiday Inn, who supposedly recognized him on a videotape. The Twittys and their friends went to the Van der Sloot home with two Aruban policemen to look for Holloway. Van der Sloot initially denied knowing Holloway's name, but he then told the following story, which was corrorborated by Deepak Kalpoe, who was present in the house: Van der Sloot related that they drove Holloway to the California Lighthouse area of Arashi Beach <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to see sharks; they later dropped Holloway off at her hotel at around 2:00a.m. According to Van der Sloot, Holloway fell down as she exited the car but refused his help. He stated that as he and Kalpoe were driving away, Holloway was approached by a dark man in a black shirt similar to those worn by security guards.|$|E
5|$|In a {{prototype}} from the series, Edward was an eighteen-year-old teenager travelling alongside his father whose soul sealed in a flying squirrel. Edward's prototype {{had an average}} height, but retained his automail. In order to fit with the readers from the manga magazine Monthly Shonen Gangan, Edward's traits were further modified, leaving his current one. His height was reduced in order to contrast with Alphonse's huge armor. In {{the design of the}} character, Arakawa is often worried about not making his automail too bulky to avoid balancing it by increasing Edward's muscles, making his appearance unsuitable for his age. She has also often drawn the character in full body length, but at one point noticed she made it too tall. As the manga continued serialization, Arakawa found that she drew Edward half naked several times even more than Alex Louis Armstrong who tends to show his torso. While stating that this was <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to draw Edward's automail, she commented that it was common for men to walk in underwear at their homes.|$|E

5|$|When Ladislaus of Naples {{sold his}} {{rights to the}} Kingdom of Dalmatia to the Republic of Venice and retreated from the Balkans in 1409, many local nobles allied {{themselves}} with the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund and accepted Ostoja as the King of Bosnia. This seriously weakened the position of Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, a Grand Duke of Bosnia, whose niece Katarina was a second wife of Sandalj Hranić, a Grand Duke of Hum. In such circumstances Sandalj decided to ally with emperor Sigismund in mid 1411 and to establish closer connections with Sigismund's important ally Stefan Lazarević. In December 1411 Sandalj divorced his wife Katarina and married Stefan's sister Jelena {{at the end of}} the same year. Jelena married Sandalj <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to strengthen the position of her son. With this marriage Sandalj, the most dangerous enemy of Balša III, became his stepfather and protector. Although it spoiled Sandalj's relations with Hrvoje, it also strengthened traditionally close relations with the Lazarević family. Although Jelena was in her forties, Sandalj hoped they would have children and in 1413 deposited some money at a transactional account with the city of Dubrovnik for the child they would eventually have.|$|E

5000|$|There {{is also a}} {{distinction}} in ethics and action theory, largely made popular by Bernard Williams (1979, reprinted in 1981), concerning internal and external reasons for action. An internal reason is, roughly, something that one has in light of one's own [...] "subjective motivational set"---one's own commitments, desires (or wants), goals, etc. On the other hand, an external reason is something that one has independent of one's subjective motivational set. For example, suppose that Sally is going to drink a glass of poison, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> to commit suicide and believes that she can do so by drinking the poison. Sally has an internal reason to drink the poison, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> to commit suicide. However, {{one might say that}} she has an external reason not to drink the poison <b>because,</b> even though <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> to die, one ought not kill oneself no matter what—regardless of whether one wants to die.|$|R

When Bronte were relegated Taylor moved to Knowsley United, who became Liverpool Ladies shortly after losing the FA Women's Cup final to Doncaster Belles in 1994. Taylor had joined Knowsley United in preference to the dominant Doncaster Belles <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> the challenge of playing for a developing club.|$|E

25|$|After {{the third}} caliph Uthman ibn Affan was assassinated by some revolters, Ali Ibn Abi Talib was elected as the fourth caliph. Ali, being more {{concerned}} about restoring peace in the land, stayed back from taking any immediate action against the assassins of the previous caliph, Uthman. In the Battle of the Camel (656), Aisha opposed her step son-in-law Ali outside the city of Basra, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> justice on the assassins of the previous caliph, Uthman.
