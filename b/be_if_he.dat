500|$|The comedy The Careless Husband (1704), {{generally}} considered to be Cibber's best play, is another example of the retrieval of a straying husband by means of outstanding wifely tact, this time in a more domestic and genteel register. The easy-going Sir Charles Easy is chronically unfaithful to his wife, seducing both ladies of quality and his own female servants with insouciant charm. The turning point of the action, known as [...] "the Steinkirk scene", comes when his wife finds him and a maidservant asleep together in a chair, [...] "as close an approximation to actual adultery as could be presented on the 18th-century stage". His periwig has fallen off, an obvious suggestion of intimacy and abandon, and an opening for Lady Easy's tact. Soliloquizing to herself about how sad it would <b>be</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> caught cold, she [...] "takes a Steinkirk off her Neck, and lays it gently on his Head" [...] (V.i.21). (A [...] "steinkirk" [...] was a loosely tied lace collar or scarf, named after the way the officers wore their cravats at the Battle of Steenkirk in 1692.) She steals away, Sir Charles wakes, notices the steinkirk on his head, marvels that his wife did not wake him and make a scene, and realises how wonderful she is. The Easys go on to have a reconciliation scene which is much more low-keyed and tasteful than that in Love's Last Shift, without kneelings and risings, and with Lady Easy shrinking with feminine delicacy from the coarse subjects that Amanda had broached without blinking. Paul Parnell has analysed the manipulative nature of Lady Easy's lines in this exchange, showing how they are directed towards the sentimentalist's goal of [...] "ecstatic self-approval".|$|E

He offered to meet Grant on the stage road at the rear of his army at 10:00a.m. on April 9. Lee realized he would know by then if his army could escape and, if not, he would have no alternative but to surrender the army or face its annihilation.|$|E
