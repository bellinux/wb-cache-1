5|$|T-26 model 1938: new conical turret, {{small changes}} in hull parts, {{increased}} volume of fuel tanks. Tank gun mod. 1937 and mod. 1938 were equipped with an electric <b>breechblock</b> and a vertically stabilized TOP-1 telescopic sight (or a TOS telescopic sight on the 1938 model).|$|E
5|$|These {{guns are}} {{air-cooled}} {{and use a}} gas blow-back recoil system. Unlike other automatic guns employed during World War II, {{the barrel of the}} 20mm Oerlikon gun does not recoil; the <b>breechblock</b> is never locked against the breech and is actually moving forward when the gun fires. This weapon lacks a counter-recoil brake, as the force of the counter-recoil is checked by recoil from the firing of the next round of ammunition.|$|E

50|$|In what he {{attributes}} to {{a message from}} God, Allison comes {{up with the idea}} to disable the artillery during the barrage that will precede the American assault, while the Japanese are still in their bunkers. He is wounded, but manages to sabotage all the guns by removing their <b>breechblocks,</b> saving many American lives. After the landing, the Marine officers are puzzled by the lack of <b>breechblocks</b> in the guns.|$|R
5000|$|His French patent [...] (Swiss: , [...] ) for the French Modèle 1935A pistol was {{acquired}} in 1937 by SIG {{and used for}} the SIG P210 pistol. The Browning-Petter system or Browning-Petter-SIG system of <b>breechblocks</b> goes back to John Browning and Charles Petter.|$|R
50|$|The third battery, also {{completed}} in 1900, was Battery Duportail, named for Major General Louis Duportail. Its armament {{consisted of two}} 12-inch breech-loading rifles on disappearing carriages. The battery was decommissioned in 1923. The Army removed the <b>breechblocks</b> and plugged the breeches before abandoning the guns in place. The Army scrapped the guns in the early 1940s.|$|R
5|$|The 37mm M5 gun had a {{manually}} operated <b>breechblock.</b> The tank commander doubled as loader, {{like many other}} tanks of the time. There was no turret basket in the M2A4 light tank; the commander stood on the right side, while the gunner stood on the left side. The commander turned the turret onto {{the general direction of}} target. The gunner would then bring the target into the M5 telescopic sight. The M20 combination mount had 20° of traverse; this could either be by a handwheel driving the rack and pinion traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or, with the gears disengaged, free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest.|$|E
5|$|Latouche-Tréville was recommissioned on 15 February 1907 and {{assigned}} to the gunnery school. The following month, her torpedo tubes were removed. On 22 September 1908, her aft turret was badly damaged when one of her loaded guns misfired when the breech was opened. The ignition of the propellant blew the <b>breechblock</b> through the turret door and threw the sighting hood onto the ship's deck. The ship was saved from being lost by a crewman who closed the door between the magazine and the ammunition hoist. Fourteen crewmen were killed and five were wounded in the incident. Repairs took {{until the end of}} the year to complete, and she resumed her duties until she was again placed in reserve on 1 January 1912. Latouche-Tréville was recommissioned on 20 November for service in the Levant; she departed Toulon on 10 December and arrived in Port Said, Egypt on 16 December. The ship was refitted in Bizerta, Tunisia, from 8 November 1913 to 26 December, during which time her military masts were replaced by light pole masts. She arrived back in Egypt on 30 December and resumed her duties.|$|E
25|$|The {{action of}} the Krag–Petersson is, {{as seen in the}} {{photograph}} to the left, simple compared to modern rifles. It consists of eight components: the receiver (A), the hammer (B), the tilting <b>breechblock</b> (C), the firing pin (D), two pins to secure the hammer and <b>breechblock</b> (E and F), a lockplate with a screw to secure the pins (G) and the tubular magazine (not shown in the photograph).|$|E
50|$|At Đồng Đăng {{there was}} an intense {{exchange}} of fire that quickly spread to other border posts overnight. The French position at the railhead at Lạng Sơn was surrounded by Japanese armour and forced to surrender on 25 September. Before surrendering, the French commanders had ordered the <b>breechblocks</b> of the 155mm cannons thrown into a river to prevent the Japanese from re-using them. During the Sino-French War of 1884-5, the French had been forced into an embarrassing retreat from Lạng Sơn in which equipment had likewise been thrown into the same river to prevent capture. When the <b>breechblocks</b> of 1940 were eventually retrieved, several chests of money lost in 1885 were found also. Among the units taken captive at Lạng Sơn was the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Foreign Infantry Regiment, marking perhaps {{the first time a}} Foreign Legion unit had surrendered without a fight. The 2nd Battalion contained 179 German and Austrian volunteers, whom the Japanese in vain tried to induce to change sides.|$|R
5|$|The retreat quickly {{broke down}} into a {{confused}} and disorganized rout. Task Force Smith suffered its highest casualties during this withdrawal as its soldiers were most exposed to enemy fire. The surviving members of Task Force Smith reached Battery A's position. The artillerymen disabled the five remaining howitzers by removing their sights and <b>breechblocks</b> and retired in good order with {{the remains of the}} task force on foot to the northern outskirts of Osan, where most of the unit's hidden transport vehicles were found intact. The vehicles, unmolested by the North Korean forces, departed for Pyongtaek and Cheonan, picking up stragglers along the way, eventually joining units of the 24th Infantry Division that had established a second line of defense.|$|R
2500|$|Some time {{in early}} 1900, four guns {{captured}} {{during the war}} were erected in the Spanish–American War dead burial field. The two modern guns {{were taken from the}} Spanish Navy armored cruisers Vizcaya and Infanta Maria Teresa. The provenance of the two smaller bronze cannon is less clear. One newspaper of the day said they came from a Spanish coastal battery in Cuba (which the paper did not identify), but the Washington Post was more specific and said they came from a coastal battery near Castillo de San Pedro de la Roca (also known as [...] "Morro Castle") at Sevilla near Santiago de Cuba. All four guns were mounted on granite pedestals. The bronze cannon were spiked, while the modern guns had their <b>breechblocks</b> removed.|$|R
25|$|The Krag–Petersson repeating rifle has {{a falling}} block action, i.e. the <b>breechblock</b> moves {{downwards}} as the mechanism is opened, actuated (operated) by {{the operation of}} the exterior hammer. The tubular magazine, containing a total of 10 rounds of ammunition, was placed under the barrel. Once the mechanism was open, an extractor ejected the spent cartridge. A fresh round of ammunition was pushed into a shaped recess on top of the falling block by the spring in the magazine, whereupon the falling block rose slightly. The round could then be pushed into the chamber by the shooter, and the <b>breechblock</b> would rise completely. This rising of the <b>breechblock</b> (by means of a powerful spring) could catch the shooter off guard, resulting in pinched skin on the thumb.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{was developed}} by Ole Herman Johannes Krag, with vital help from his friend Axel Petersson on the actuation of the mechanism. Ole H. J. Krag had been experimenting with repeating rifles for several years before he designed the Krag–Petersson rifle. His earlier models were actuated by a side-mounted lever working an interior crankshaft. Moving the lever in a half circle, counter-clockwise, made the <b>breechblock</b> – {{the part of the}} mechanism that seals the rear of the barrel – move back and down. The rearward movement of the <b>breechblock</b> automatically ejected the spent round and the downward movement allowed the magazine follower to push a new round into the breech. In 1871, Axel Petersson suggested changing the design to allow the hammer to operate the <b>breechblock</b> instead, thus making the mechanism both simpler and easier to operate. The Krag–Petersson, like Krag's previous design, featured a tubular magazine under the barrel.|$|E
25|$|The Type 38 75mm Field Gun was a {{thoroughly}} conventional design for its day, complete with crew {{seats on the}} gun shield and a solid box trail. It had a hydrospring recoil system, interrupted screw type <b>breechblock,</b> and 1/16-inch gun shield.|$|E

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the revolt, the two Brazilian dreadnoughts were disarmed by the removal of their guns' <b>breechblocks.</b> The revolt and consequent state of the navy, which was essentially unable to operate for fear of another rebellion, caused many leading Brazilians, including the president, prominent politicians like Barbosa and the Baron of Rio Branco, and the editor of the most respected newspaper in Brazil, Jornal do Commercio, to question the use of the new ships and support their sale to a foreign country. The British ambassador to Brazil, W.H.D. Haggard, was ecstatic at Rio Branco's about-face, saying [...] "This is indeed a wonderful surrender {{on the part of the}} man who was answerable for the purchase and who looked upon them as the most cherished offspring of his policy."

25|$|The barrel, {{much longer}} than that of older designs, was fitted with an {{interrupted}} screw <b>breechblock</b> with recoil devices consisting of hydraulic recoil buffer and hydropneumatic recuperator. The recoil length was variable. Gun shield provided the crew with limited protection from bullets and shell fragments.|$|E
25|$|The M-30 used many {{elements}} from existing guns, {{most notably the}} interrupted-screw <b>breechblock</b> of the M1910/30. Since at that time Soviet industry had experienced major difficulties with manufacturing sliding breechblocks (as used by the F-25) for large caliber guns, the lowered technical risk {{can be considered a}} significant advantage.|$|E
25|$|The Type 94 75mm {{mountain}} gun had a single-piece {{gun barrel}} with a sliding <b>breechblock</b> based on German Krupp designs, {{and a long}} split-trail carriage with a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism based on French Schneider designs. The crew was partially protected by a gun shield made of 1/8-inch (3mm) thick armor plate.|$|E
50|$|Hays Army Ammunition Plant was an 7.9 acre, 1,650-employee foundry {{established}} in 1942 in the Hays neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. At first it produced 16 in shells and 5 in <b>breechblocks</b> for the Navy. Though {{owned by the}} Army, the plant was operated by the Mesta Machine Company {{on behalf of the}} United States Navy during World War II. The plant was operated by the Mullins Manufacturing Company during the Korean War and by the Levinson Steel Company during the Vietnam War. For the Army it produced 105 mm shells, 250,000 of these per month throughout 1968. It was the only Army plant with cold extrusion capability. Manufacturing ceased in May 1970 and the plant was mothballed in June 1971. The 1982 value of the complex was $69 million. The plant was placed on standby in 1991 and donated for redevelopment in 1993. It is now used as an industrial site.|$|R
50|$|On 22 April, {{the battery}} was camped at 'Kitchener's Wood' {{en route to}} Ypres to be {{attached}} to the Indian Corps when the Germans launched a surprise attack (the 2nd Battle of Ypres) behind a gas cloud and broke through the French defenders. Although reportedly armed with only seven rifles, the Londoners fought a stubborn rearguard action as the Germans entered the wood, allowing the gunners to remove the <b>breechblocks</b> and firing pins from their 4.7s before escaping. The guns were recaptured by the 2nd Canadian Division but the position could not be held and the guns were abandoned. The Germans subsequently reported their capture of the guns marked 'London', causing 'considerable anxiety in London, from the impression thereby created that the London Division had been at Ypres in the gas attack, and had been driven back to such an extent as to lose their heavy guns'.|$|R

25|$|The {{barrel of}} the M-30 was of {{built-up}} construction and consisted of a liner, jacket and breech. The <b>breechblock</b> was of interrupted screw type, with forced cartridge case extraction. The gun was equipped with a hydraulic recoil buffer and hydropneumatic recuperator. A panoramic sight was used for both indirect and direct fire.|$|E
25|$|In 1907, {{he gained}} some fame for an {{incident}} aboard the USS Connecticut during a target practice exercise.

40|$|Theoretical and {{practical}} research of temperature influence on mechanical {{characteristics of the}} composite material «Multimetal Stahl 1018 » («MM Stahl 1018 ») have been conducted. Both the laboratory equipment {{used to measure the}} mechanical properties, the technique of material preparation and the experimental procedure were described. The compressive tests were carried out on Zwick Roell Amsler HB 100, that can approximate the experiment to real conditions, as it has a special heat chamber in which the samples were heated up to 20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C. The samples were subjected to the load of 15 kN, 30 KN to complete failure. The experimental values of conventional yield limit of «MM Stahl 1018 » samples of various thicknesses for high temperatures have been got. On the strength of this experiment when repairing machinery and parts operating at high temperatures, it is recommended to use the material layer of no more than two millimeters and apply a little loaded nodes. The analysis {{of the results of the}} experiments showed that temperature increasing, the yield strength of the material decreases. The «MM Stahl 1018 » basing on the best polymers that almost do not shrink at hardening, has good chemical resistance. The powders - fillers include high quality stainless steel, ceramics and additives for improving the surface tension and chemical resistance. Due to its perfect viscous consistency «MM Stahl 1018 » can be easily applied with a spatula on wedges <b>breechblocks</b> or bridge supports and is evenly distributed in all directions at assembling. Thanks to «MM Stahl 1018 » good forming properties the units may be fitted on the spot with the accuracy of 1 / 100 mm that is of 100 % accuracy, no additional fitting is required, i. e., traditional fitting of wedges <b>breechblocks</b> and piers to the lower zone of the bridge. At assembling a bridge support must be adjusted in the final position with 100 % accuracy. This material can work in real conditions at elevated temperatures, but it is still necessary to conduct a series of experiments adding a vibration load as wel...|$|R
50|$|Despite some {{advantages}} of the NM, notably its versatility and very light weight for a 152-mm piece, the production was cancelled after {{a limited number of}} guns were built. According to M. Svirin, complexity of the design was the main reason. For example, Soviet ordnance plants experienced major problems with production of sliding <b>breechblocks.</b> Also, the NM poorly fitted the Soviet artillery doctrine, mainly because of its range - too short for a divisional gun. The related German design - the 15 cm sIG 33 - was employed as a regimental weapon; it was somewhat heavy for a regimental piece. In the RKKA, the niche of heavy regimental weapon was filled by a 120 mm infantry mortar, a cheaper, lighter weapon with slightly longer range, {{but on the other hand}} less powerful, less accurate and less versatile. Eventually, a need for a divisional weapon more powerful than a 122 mm howitzer became apparent; in 1943 the RKKA adopted another infantry mortar, the 160 mm divisional mortar MT-13, which was similar to the NM in terms of weight, range and shell weight.|$|R
25|$|For {{so light}} a weapon, it {{embodied}} a remarkable number of modern construction features. It had a Schneider type, hydropneumatic independent recoil system, a Krupp type horizontal sliding-wedge <b>breechblock,</b> split trails with spade plates for stabilizers, pintle traverse, and an equalizing arrangement which gave it three-point suspension. Since it was trunnioned {{at the center}} of balance, it did not require equilibrators. It could be fired with trails closed or open.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} Japanese designs, {{it had a}} very low profile and was {{intended}} to be operated from a squat or prone position. The gun had a gun shield to protect the gunner and open carriage-style legs which could be spread to improve the stability. The breech had a semi-automatic cartridge case ejection system to improve reloading time. When the shell was loaded, the rear of the cartridge case tripped a catch closing the <b>breechblock.</b> The recoil action of firing opened the breech and extracted the cartridge case.|$|E
25|$|Since {{it weighs}} only 400 pounds {{more than the}} Model 41 cavalry gun, it is {{possible}} that the Model 95 may have been intended to replace that weapon. However, its use on Saipan and its close resemblance to the heavier Model 90 may indicate that the latter weapon was too heavy for efficient horse-draft, and too complex for the capabilities of Japanese industry. Though the Model 95 was split-trailed, it actually weighed less than the improved Model 38 75mm gun. The Model 95 was much lighter than its Schneider prototype, and had a sliding wedge rather than an interrupted thread <b>breechblock.</b> It incorporated all features of modern Japanese design.|$|E
5000|$|Although Japan had not {{declared}} war on Great Britain, Japanese marines also boarded the Peterel to demand her surrender. Polkinghorn attempted to stall for time, {{in order for the}} demolition fuses to be lit and the code books to be passed down a special chute in order to be burned in the boiler room. When his attempts failed, Polkinghorn told them to [...] "Get off my bloody ship!" [...] The Japanese disembarked and almost immediately the Japanese cruiser , the accompanying gunboat Toba and Japanese shore batteries in the French Concession opened fire at almost point-blank range. Despite being outnumbered and hopelessly outgunned, the Royal Navy crew of HMS Peterel returned fire, using small arms and the deck-mounted Lewis machine guns (the <b>breechblocks</b> from her 3-inch guns having been removed and taken to the Royal Navy dockyard in Hong Kong). The Royal Navy crew inflicted several casualties on the Japanese before Peterel capsized and drifted from its mooring under heavy fire. The Japanese machine gunned both the surviving Royal Navy and locally recruited Chinese crewmen in the water.|$|R
5000|$|A captains' {{conference on}} the Olympia {{revealed}} little damage and no men killed. It was discovered that the original ammunition message had been garbled—instead of only 15 rounds of ammunition per gun remaining, the message had meant to say only 15 rounds of ammunition per gun had been expended. During the conference reports arrived that sounds of exploding ammunition had been heard and fires sighted on the Cristina and Castilla. At 10:40 AM action was resumed but the Spanish offered little resistance and Montojo issued orders for the remaining ships to be scuttled and the <b>breechblocks</b> of their guns taken ashore. The Olympia, Baltimore and Boston then fired on the Sangley Point battery putting it out of action and followed up by sinking the Ulloa. The Concord fired on the transport Mindanao, whose crew immediately abandoned ship. The [...] fired on the government offices next to the arsenal and a white flag was raised over the building after which all firing ceased. The Spanish colors were struck at 12:40 PM.|$|R
50|$|When the German Spring Offensive {{opened on}} 21 March 1918 (the Battle of St Quentin), 59th Division {{was holding the}} line of the Bullecourt Salient. The German attack {{followed}} a hurricane bombardment and was covered by morning mist, and quickly overran the defences of the division's Forward Zone. 2/4th Leicesters had only just come out of the line after 24 hours of continuous trench duty. It was sent straight back up to assist in the defence of Ecoust, but the leading company found that the village had already fallen, and was unable to do more than cover the retreat of the gunners of a field battery which had removed the <b>breechblocks</b> of their guns before being overrun. The battalion could get no further forward than the rear of the Battle Zone. Here the 'line' {{was no more than a}} yet-to-be-dug trench marked out with the turf removed and no barbed wire. The men extended along the line but were completely exposed in the open. An officer stood in the Écoust road, stopping stragglers and directing them to join the Leicesters. Under the inspiring leadership of their CO, Lt-Col Sir Iain Colquhoun, 7th Baronet, and Regimental Sergeant-Major 'African Joe' Withers, the battalion held off the Germans for the rest of the day, with modest casualties of 12 killed and 18 wounded.|$|R
