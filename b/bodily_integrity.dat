Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity. Church teachings about sexuality have become an issue of increasing controversy, especially after the close of the Second Vatican Council, due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world described as the sexual revolution.|$|E
5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} {{the person is}} the {{infringement}} {{of the right to}} <b>bodily</b> <b>integrity.</b> It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the right to liberty. It is the very touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this topic is Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the threat of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum {{created the}} human {{capabilities}} approach {{as an alternative}} way to assess economic success rooted in the ideas of welfare economics {{and focused on the}} individual's potential to do and be what he or she may choose to value. Unlike traditional economic measures of success, focused on GDP, utility, income, assets or other monetary measures, the capabilities approach focuses on what individuals are able to do. This approach emphasizes processes as well as outcomes, and draws attention to cultural, social and material dynamics of well-being. Martha Nussbaum, expanded on the model with a more complete list of central capabilities including life, health, <b>bodily</b> <b>integrity,</b> thought, and more. In recent years, the capabilities approach has influenced the creation of new models including the UN's Human Development Index (HDI).|$|E
40|$|Greater {{cognitive}} ability in childhood {{is associated with}} increased longevity, and speedier reaction time (RT) might account {{for much of this}} linkage. Greater bodily symmetry is linked to both higher cognitive test scores and faster RTs. It is possible, then, that differences in <b>bodily</b> system <b>integrity</b> indexed by symmetry may underlie the associations of RT and intelligence with increased longevity. However, RT and symmetry have seldom been examined in the same study, and never in children. Here, in 2 large samples aged 4 to 15 (combined n = 856), we found that more symmetrical children had significantly faster mean choice RT and less variability in RT. These associations of faster and less variable RT with greater symmetry early in life raise the possibility that the determinants of longevity in part originate in processes influencing <b>bodily</b> system <b>integrity</b> early in the life-course...|$|R

The {{moral and political}} suppositions of liberalism {{have been based on}} traditions such as natural rights and utilitarian theory, although sometimes liberals even requested support from scientific and religious circles. Through all these strands and traditions, scholars have identified the following major common facets of liberal thought: believing in equality and individual liberty, supporting private property and individual rights, supporting the idea of limited constitutional government, and recognising the importance of related values such as pluralism, toleration, autonomy, <b>bodily</b> <b>integrity</b> and consent.|$|E

2500|$|A {{key area}} of concern facing {{intersex}} people is that as infants they are often subjected to medical operations to [...] "normalise" [...] their genitalia and obscure their non-binary sex characteristics.

In October 2013, the Australian Senate published a report entitled 'Involuntary or coerced sterilisation of intersex people in Australia'. The Senate found that [...] "normalising" [...] surgeries are taking place in Australia, often on infants and young children.

In a number of modern states, circumcision is presumed to be legal, but laws pertaining to assault or child custody have been applied in cases involving circumcision. In the case of non-therapeutic circumcision of children, proponents of laws {{in favor of the}} procedure often point to the rights of the parents or practitioners, namely the right of freedom to religion.

This paper explores three controversial medical procedures performed on individuals with disabilities, which include sterilization, cochlear implants, and growth attenuation. Embedded in each medical procedure mentioned above are social, legal, ethical, and psychological variables that influenced the emergence of each procedure and the receptiveness of society. This project explores each of these variables in detail as it relates to growth attenuation, sterilization, and cochlear implants, with a focus on similar themes surrounding each medical procedure. These themes will then be applied to growth attenuation, a more recent procedure, to search for parallels and to anticipate future directions of the debate and use of the procedure...|$|R

[...] It also recognized that the State of New York had, {{as a matter of}} policy, a compelling interest in forbidding assisted suicide, while allowing a patient to refuse life support was simply an act of protecting a common-law right. This right was not, contrary to the Court of Appeals' view, the [...] "right to hasten death"; rather, the Court declared that it was the right to retain <b>bodily</b> <b>integrity</b> and to preserve individual autonomy.

Instead of applying an undue burden analysis, Justice Stevens {{would have preferred to}} apply the analyses in Akron and Thornburgh, two cases that had applied a strict scrutiny analysis, to reach the same conclusions. Justice Stevens also placed great emphasis on the fact that women had a right to <b>bodily</b> <b>integrity,</b> and a constitutionally protected liberty interest to decide matters of the [...] "highest privacy and the most personal nature."

2500|$|... {{has been}} of central {{significance}} {{to the development of}} human society. It can be the beginning, not only of individual knowledge, information and awareness, but also a holistic strategy for development and change. Education is very much connected to women's ability to form social relationships on the basis of equality with others and to achieve the important social good of self-respect. It is important, as well, to mobility (through access to jobs and the political process) and to health and life (through the connection to <b>bodily</b> <b>integrity).</b> Education can allow women to participate in politics so they can ensure that their voices and concerns are heard and addressed in the public policy. It is also crucial for women's access to the legal system. Although it must be considered that religion and traditions of the Pakistani affect women's education. Some women may choose to keep the traditional roles because that is what they have always known and are used to. It would be a great opportunity if women were able to make their choice on their own, though. They should at least have the knowledge of both sides to be educated or to stay with the traditional ways.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: female Genital Mutilation is internationally {{considered}} an affront {{on human rights}} and an act of violence against women and young girls. Furthermore, it hierarchises and perpetuates inequality and denies the right to <b>bodily</b> and psychosocial <b>integrity</b> of women and young girls. Aims: to detect the key points for the abolition of Female Genital Mutilation {{as well as the}} necessary resources for its eradication. Material and Method: a qualitative methodology with an ethnonursing perspective, via semi-structured interviews, held both individually and in groups, in 21 men familiar with Female Genital Mutilation. Findings: through the voices of men familiar with this tradition, five key points are presented for its gradual eradication: sensitisation and awareness building, team action, abolition-promoting media, focusing action on rural areas and applying educational means before punitive ones. Conclusion and practical implications: awareness-raising via the combined efforts of families, communities and governments, together with the promotion of health education programmes in demonstrating the complications derived from this practice, play a vital part in eradicating Female Genital Mutilation...|$|R
6000|$|Thus amazing case {{makes it}} {{possible}} to say, with some prospect of being believed, that there is in the classes who can afford to pay for fashionable operations a sprinkling of persons so incapable of appreciating the relative importance of preserving their <b>bodily</b> <b>integrity,</b> (including the capacity for parentage) and the pleasure of talking about themselves and hearing themselves talked about as the heroes and heroines of sensational operations, that they tempt surgeons to operate on them not only with large fees, but with personal solicitation. Now it cannot be too often repeated that when an operation is once performed, nobody can ever prove that it was unnecessary. If I refuse to allow my leg to be amputated, its mortification and my death may prove that I was wrong; but if I let the leg go, nobody can ever prove that it would not have mortified had I been obstinate. Operation is therefore the safe side for the surgeon as well as the lucrative side. The result is that we hear of [...] "conservative surgeons" [...] as a distinct class of practitioners who make it a rule not to operate if they can possibly help it, and who are sought after by the people who have vitality enough to regard an operation as a last resort. But no surgeon is bound to take the conservative view. If he believes that an organ is at best a useless survival, and that if he extirpates it the patient will be well and none the worse in a fortnight, whereas to await the natural cure would mean a month's illness, then he is clearly justified in recommending the operation even if the cure without operation is as certain as anything of the kind ever can be. Thus the conservative surgeon and the radical or extirpatory surgeon may both be right as far as the ultimate cure is concerned; so that their consciences do not help them out of their differences.|$|E

40|$|The ethics, or morality, {{of farming}} a {{relatively}} novel and undomesticated group of animals, the ratites, is considered. Ethical considerations for animal management centre on {{their right to}} life, <b>bodily</b> health and <b>integrity,</b> opportunity to use their senses and emotions, to have affiliations with conspecifics {{and be part of}} a worldwide species network, to play and to have control over one’s environment. Ratites are considered to present greater ethical problems compared to conventional animal farming because of their inherent unsuitability for farming for meat and other products and their limited level of domestication. This unsuitability arises principally from their large size, slow maturation and limited social structure relative to other farmed birds. The absence of a domestication influence to reduce aggression and flight distance means that they have a significant potential to inflict damage on themselves, their handlers and conspecifics. Bodily mutilations, such as declawing may mitigate damage to others, but is ethically questionable because of potential welfare impact and offence to integrity. It is concluded that significant ethical concerns surround ratite farming that make the practice of dubious value as a means of producing food and leather with due respect to the animals’ needs...|$|R
