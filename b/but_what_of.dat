The triumphs and the frauds, the treasures and the fakes. A fact of life. We’re going to die. “Be of good heart,” cry the dead artists out of the living past. Our songs will all be silenced – <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>of</b> it? Go on singing. Maybe a man’s name doesn’t matter all that much.|$|E
500|$|Oosterbaan {{believed}} {{success was}} fleeting. [...] He once {{was quoted in}} Time Magazine as saying, [...] "I'm on top now, {{and there is a}} lot of backslapping. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>of</b> seasons to come? Let me lose the opener or a couple of other games next fall, and then watch how I'm blasted." [...] As coach, he had a reputation as a mild-mannered man who aspired to live by the maxims of his own college football coach, Fielding Yost.|$|E
500|$|Some would claim... {{that it is}} {{the most}} American of our orchestras, {{thinking}} no doubt of the Previn legacy, Bernstein's Presidency and Tilson Thomas's appointment. Others, looking back further to Pierre Monteux's reign, think it our most French orchestra, a quality nurtured by Previn and latterly Claudio Abbado. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>of</b> their essaying of the Slavonic repertoire under Istvan Kertész, or of Mahler, whose idiom has been finely honed by Abbado? No, the LSO remains enigmatic, unpredictable and supremely individual. Of all the London orchestras the LSO seems to have more [...] "personalities", more [...] "individuals" [...] and has given the solo world more than its fair share of [...] "star" [...] performers. As an orchestra the LSO has never been prepared to submit to one principal conductor for long (one thinks of Karajan in Berlin, Haitink in Amsterdam or Mravinsky in Leningrad) but one of its greatest strengths remains its ability to attract fine conductors and dedicate itself wholeheartedly to creating a genuine performance.|$|E

500|$|During {{the debate}} on Howe's war {{spending}} estimates in 1945 (which totalled $1.365billion), Howe answered an Opposition question on whether such a large sum could be reduced: [...] "I dare say my honourable friend could cut a million dollars from that amount, but a million dollars from the War Appropriations Bill {{would not be a}} very important matter." [...] Saskatchewan Tory MP John Diefenbaker spoke the following day, and alleged that Howe had said, [...] "We may save a million dollars, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>of</b> it?" [...] Howe angrily denied the quote, accusing Diefenbaker of being [...] "a past master of distortion"—language he was forced to withdraw as unparliamentary. Diefenbaker sharpened the anecdote over time, and it emerged in its final form as Howe saying, [...] "What's a million?" [...] Even Liberals who knew that Howe had made no such statement agreed that it was just the sort of thing he could have said. [...] In the years to come, [...] "What's a million?" [...] would be a mocking Tory attack on the Liberals, most often directed at Howe.|$|E
2500|$|In this case, {{the court}} quickly {{detected}} the plot and merely needed confirmation. [...] <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>of</b> {{cases where the}} facts were not clear, or the decision was difficult? [...] It was these that provided the gravest difficulties with jury trials following the abolition of trial by ordeal. [...] Upon the calling of a general Court of Eyre, {{it was easy to}} assemble a thousand or more jurors, who could be questioned, and pronounce a prisoner guilty or not. [...] If the proceedings were instigated upon the delivery and indictment from a gaol, before a non-professional judge, most prisoners were coerced to put themselves upon the mercy of a jury trial, and forgo their ancient right to trial by ordeal. If they refused a jury trial, there was no option but to keep them in prison until they changed their mind.|$|E
2500|$|Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama in turn saw {{the meeting}} as a {{precursor}} to warfare {{on the part of}} Moriori and responded. The Māori attacked and in the ensuing action killed over 260 Moriori. A Moriori survivor recalled: [...] " [...] commenced to kill us like sheep... were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed — men, women and children — indiscriminately." [...] A Māori chief, Te Rakatau Katihe, said: [...] "We took possession ... in accordance with our custom, and we caught all the people. Not one escaped. Some ran away from us, these we killed; and others also we killed — <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>of</b> that? It was in accordance with our custom." [...] Despite the Chatham Islands being made part of New Zealand in 1842, Māori kept Moriori slaves until 1863 ...|$|E

2500|$|Kim Jong-il's former {{personal}} chef, Kenji Fujimoto, revealed details regarding Kim Jong-un, {{with whom}} he had a good relationship, stating that he was favored to be his father's successor. Fujimoto also said that Jong-un was favored by his father over his elder brother, Kim Jong-chul, reasoning that Jong-chul is too feminine in character, while Jong-un is [...] "exactly like his father". Furthermore, Fujimoto stated that [...] "If power is to be handed over then Jong-un is the best for it. He has superb physical gifts, is a big drinker and never admits defeat." [...] Also, according to Fujimoto, Jong-un smokes Yves Saint Laurent cigarettes, loves Johnnie Walker whisky and has a Mercedes-Benz 600 luxury sedan. When Jong-un was 18, Fujimoto described an episode where Jong-un once questioned his lavish lifestyle and asked, [...] "We are here, playing basketball, riding horses, riding jet skis, having fun together. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>of</b> the lives of the average people?" [...] On 15 January 2009 the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that Kim Jong-il had appointed Kim Jong-un to be his successor.|$|E
2500|$|Turning {{finally to}} Bilski's method, {{the court held}} it patent-ineligible. First, the court said, Bilski did not argue that the {{rejected}} claims recited any specific or [...] "particular" [...] machine, so that the court found it unnecessary to decide any issues relating to the machine-implementation branch of the test. [...] "We leave to future cases the elaboration of the precise contours of machine implementation, {{as well as the}} answers to particular questions, such as whether or when recitation of a computer suffices to tie a process claim to a particular machine." [...] Second, the court turned to transformation of articles from one thing or state to another. What is an [...] "article"? Benson had made it clear that tanning hides, smelting ores, and vulcanizing rubber were all instances of transforming articles. This corresponded to the transformation test as the PTO and some amici curiae articulated it: one physical substance is transformed into a second physical substance. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>of</b> electronic signals and electronically manipulated data? Or even more abstract constructs such as legal obligations, which the Bilski case involved? No Supreme Court precedents addressed such entities.|$|E
