50|$|For the {{conversion}} a DR Class 22 new-design boiler, {{parts of the}} unsuccessful high pressure locomotive, H 45 024, (outside cylinders, trailing wheels and rear section of the locomotive frame) {{as well as the}} tender of locomotive 44 468 were used. The inside cylinder of the three-cylinder engine was not however taken from 61 002, rather a new one was made. Other technical improvements were a Riggenbach counter-pressure brake and a Giesl ejector. The locomotive was streamlined at the front and over the <b>boiler</b> <b>fittings.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Class S1 boiler was {{provided}} with SAR standard <b>boiler</b> <b>fittings,</b> {{such as a}} multi-valve steam regulator fitted in the smokebox, a duplex top-feed valve for the delivery of feedwater from the injectors, a soot blower and external exhaust pipe to the smokebox, and a steam turret for the distribution of steam to the various steam-operated mechanisms. The valves for the latter were mounted on the steam turret and were fitted with spindles which extended into the cab from where they were operated by means of handwheels.|$|E
5000|$|By 1882, the {{original}} overhaul and heavy maintenance facilities were inadequate for the railway's extensive operations, {{and so a}} new [...] "Earl of Durham Works" [...] was built in Philadelphia, which was quickly renamed the Lambton Engine Works. Consisting of two through-running roads for loco repairs, {{the rest of the}} structure was filled with machinery. Adjacent to the building were <b>boiler,</b> <b>fitting</b> and machine shops, so that the Works was almost self-contained, with new boilers and fireboxes being the only major items purchased from outside contractors.|$|R
50|$|Some {{locomotive}} designers in Britain {{continued to}} use domeless boilers even after the use of steam domes became commonplace. The square-topped Belpaire firebox allows steam to be conveniently collected at its top corners and therefore locomotives with Belpaire fireboxes often dispensed with a dome, for example express engines such as the GWR Castle Class (the large brass <b>boiler</b> <b>fitting</b> on a Castle is the distinctive GWR safety valve cover, not a dome). Ultimately, the restrictive British loading gauge was a major factor which determined {{the size of the}} dome, with large-boilered express locomotives, such as the LNER Class A1, only having space for a very shallow dome.|$|R

50|$|The Oldenburg T 2 steam {{locomotives}} were German 0-4-0 tank engines built between 1896 and 1913 for the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways (Großherzoglich Oldenburgische Staatseisenbahnen). They {{were designed}} for use on branch lines (Lokal- and Nebenbahnen). A total of 38 units were produced, based on a Prussian T 2 prototype and differing only in the <b>boiler</b> <b>fittings.</b> Unlike their Prussian cousins, they had no steam dome and the regulator was located in the smokebox. Its permitted top speed of 50 km/h was also higher than the Prussian version.|$|E
5000|$|Built in 1929 by the NBL (North British Locomotive Company) in Glasgow, {{it was one}} of {{a number}} of steam {{locomotives}} built around the world in the search for [...] "Superpower steam". The locomotive was a joint venture between the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), with Henry Fowler as Chief Mechanical Engineer (C.M.E.) and The Superheater Company with the latter having responsibility for constructing the complex, 3 stage Schmidt-based boiler. The LMS provided a Royal Scot frame and running gear. [...] For the complex boiler, John Brown & Company of Sheffield forged the special nickel-steel alloy high pressure drum and many <b>boiler</b> <b>fittings</b> were imported from Germany but otherwise all manufacture was carried out by NBL.|$|E
50|$|Fowler {{tried to}} have the design altered to use {{standard}} Derby components. However the design process and pre-production were sufficiently advanced to prevent the fitting of a smaller Derby pattern boiler, and the cylinders and motion also remained as designed by Hughes. The tender {{was replaced by a}} Derby standard type, which was narrower than the cab. Standard Midland Railway <b>boiler</b> <b>fittings</b> and brake equipment were also substituted, and the class became something of a hybrid design. Nevertheless they performed rather well in most circumstances and gained a strong reputation in some areas, especially in Scotland, where they became the preferred locomotive for heavy unfitted mineral work on difficult routes, even after the introduction of the Stanier mixed traffic 4-6-0s.|$|E

50|$|Kilmar {{was another}} long boiler 0-6-0ST {{supplied}} new in 1869 by Hopkins Gilkes and Company (successors to Gilkes, Wilson and Co), works number 264. She {{was similar to}} Cheesewring but with a shorter tank and modified <b>boiler</b> <b>fittings.</b> Driving wheels were, again, 4 ft 0in diameter and cylinders were either 12in x 24in or 14in x 24in (sources disagree; Messenger says 13in x 24in). She was the only locomotive recorded to {{have been involved in}} an accident on the L&CR when a load of granite blocks that she was hauling managed to move the rails apart when heavy rain softened the ground sufficiently for the blocks holding the rails to move. While several wagons fell between the rails, Kilmar was unaffected, continuing her journey and returning the following day with a gang and lifting tackle. She became GWR number 1313 (Mitchell and Smith say 1312) and was scrapped in 1914.|$|E
5000|$|In 1849, B. Schäffer {{patented}} {{the design}} of a diaphragm pressure gauge. The following year he formed a business partnership with his brother-in-law C.F. Budenberg, The Schäffer & Budenberg Machinery & <b>Boiler</b> <b>Fittings</b> Company, in the altstadt of the Prussian town of Magdeburg Germany. They began manufacturing pressure gauges and all items relating the steam industry. In 1858 they moved to purpose built premises on Schoenebecker Strasse in the suburb of Buckau. The company became known by the shorter name of The Schäffer & Budenberg Manufacturing Company (S&B) [...] "a special factory for the production of fine mechanical instruments". However, locally in Buckau they were always known as 'Schäffers'. Export success {{on the back of the}} every increasing steam industry led to the formation of manufacturing and sales subsidiaries all over the world. In c1875 the company produced its first Bourdon type pressure gauges thanks to the expiry of patents. They opened American Schäffer & Budenberg office & factory in Brooklyn, New York in 1876, and briefly a second factory in Foxboro, Massachusetts. They had 5 factories, 4 depots, 25 offices and numerous agencies over five continents by the beginning of WWI employing nearly 8,000.|$|E
50|$|None of the {{original}} class survive, but a static replica of The Queen was commissioned by Tussauds for the Railways and Royalty exhibition at Windsor and Eton Central railway station. The replica loco was completed in December 1982 and displayed outside Steamtown in January 1983 (where it was constructed), before being transported by road to Windsor on 12 January 1983 and arriving on 14 January.The main frames, footplate, 'boiler', smokebox, cab and splashers were fabricated by Babcock's of Tipton. The tender was modified from an LBSCR C2x tender. Parts from a GWR tender, {{that came from the}} Dumbleton Hall Preservation Society, were used to provide the wheels for the front bogie and the real wheels. The top halves of the driving wheels do not exist, and were cast from 2 quarters, being bolted together to make a half, and the driving wheels also don't sit on the rail, so the loco could be wheeled into position on its front bogie and rear wheels.Some <b>boiler</b> <b>fittings</b> were obtained from the Great Western Society and sandblasted, and the dome and safety valve bonnet were made by Newcastle Metal Spinners.Tussaud's fitted smoke and steam generators, so steam was emitted from the cab, whistles, safety valves and smoke from the chimney. A sound unit was also fitted.|$|E
50|$|The {{resultant}} locomotive {{included many}} proprietary <b>boiler</b> and ancillary <b>fittings,</b> {{as well as}} parts interchange ability.

5000|$|It {{quickly became}} {{apparent}} that the damage to Montagu was even worse than initially feared. Divers went over the side at daybreak and found that a rock had pushed the hull 10 ft inward. Help arrived on the afternoon of 30 May 1906, but the ship settled {{in such a way that}} water rose and fell through the holes in her hull; within 24 hours her boiler rooms, steering compartment, starboard engine room, and forward capstan engine room, as well as other compartments, had flooded, and she began to list to starboard. All moveable objects were secured and the port engine room flooded to stop the list from increasing. At times only her upper deck was above water.The Royal Navy had no experience of salvage and no salvage arm. They had been impressed by the Russian success in recovering major warships damaged at the Battle of Port Arthur and had studied a book by Frederick Young of the Liverpool Salvage Company, later to become Commodore Sir Frederic Young, the Admiralty's first Chief Salvage Officer. The commander of the Channel fleet, Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson, took charge of the operation with Young appointed as advisor. Young's son later claimed that Wilson's salvage plans were [...] "wrong, impractical or both".From June through August 1906, Montagu was lightened through the removal of her 12 in and 6 in guns, heavy machinery, parts of her <b>boilers,</b> heavy <b>fittings,</b> and some of her bow armour.

40|$|Harnessing {{energy from}} biomass had caught many researcher’s and scientists’ attention. Converting palm oil mill waste, {{decanter}} cakes into solid fuels is objective of this study especially to extract its potentiality to replace the existing boilers feed and to find the optimum condition {{that leads to the}} maximum energy recovery. The main steps involve in the process is pyrolysis at temperature ranges from 300 °C to 600 °C, the drying or heating process for 24 hours at temperature of 110 °C and studying the combustion characteristics in terms of heating values and comparing it to that of the commercial solid fuels. The works carried in this research also involve the proximate analysis and semi-quantitative analysis that leads to the computation of HHV and it is compared with that from the Oxygen-bomb Calorimeter (OBC). It also involve the combustion test of different diameter of DDCs and PDCs spheres to determine the optimum diameter. Based on the study, the decanter cakes is feasible to replace fiber and shell as boiler’s feed that promotes more than sufficient heat to dry the 70 kg/ton of decanter cake in-plant and hence generates electricity with and excess steam around 289. 075 kg/hr. In fact, the calculation revealed that decanter cakes are feasible {{to be used as a}} new boilers fuel when using a steam system from <b>boiler.</b> The <b>fittings</b> generated from the combination of the SEM & EDX data, TGA data and OBC data can be used to estimate the calorific values (J/g) of the solid fuels with percentage error of 0. 01 % and 0. 45 %. From the study, it can be concluded that the pyrolysis process of DDC did not increase the fixed carbon value and hence lowering the HHV of the solid fuels as the temperature of pyrolysis process increase. The dried decanter cakes at 110 °C at 5 cm in diameter gives better solid fuels characteristics in terms of the heat value and flame characteristics compared to E-Ignite charcoal briquettes and charcoal briquettes derived from coconut shell...|$|R
