40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we report our {{progress}} {{in building a}} system for the acquisition, analysis, and visualization {{of a collection of}} Native Californian baskets from the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology. Our project differs from existing cultural heritage applications in terms of its focus: to build tools and techniques for visualizing and studying a large number of related objects – in this case, baskets. We present our progress in the following system components: (i) laser-scanning of <b>baskets,</b> (<b>ii)</b> construction and processing of 3 D models, and (iii) building virtual exhibits. We conclude the paper with our experiences and a summary of challenges we anticipate in building a completely automated system for processing and analyzing a large set of models – such as might be encountered when digitizing a large museum collection. Efficient retrieval and visualization of artifact collections are important to a number of communities, including anthropology researchers, Native American tribes, and the general public. I...|$|R

Interim results from two ongoing phase 1 trials have been recently reported at the 2016 AACR American Association for Cancer Research Conference in April 2016: among the patients treated with entrectinib, four patients had tumors harboring NTRK fusions, including patients with {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC), mCRC, salivary gland cancer, and astrocytoma.|$|R
50|$|Five years later, S.M. Wheeler {{returned}} {{with his wife}} Georgette Wheeler {{to try and do}} a more in depth excavation and analysis of Hidden Cave. Together, they were known for their photography and field note-taking ability. That summer they collected over 1500 different artifacts related to the <b>Basket</b> Makers <b>II</b> and III cultures. The discovery of a horse bone indicated that the cave might have been open during the Pleistocene. The Wheelers still had a difficult time excavating due to the dust. At the end of the summer, they put up an iron gate to prevent vandalism, allow people to see what they had discovered, and to allow future archeologists to explore.|$|R
50|$|Lewis H. Morgan visited Montezuma Valley in 1878 {{during one}} of his trips through the American Southwest. At that time he made notes and maps of archaeological sites at the current Hawkins Preserve and nearby Mitchell Springs. Within the Hawkins Preserve he {{recorded}} cliff dwellings found along McElmo Canyon. The site included groups of several small chambers just above the canyon bottom. Nearby is a corral that held cattle, sheep or other livestock. It was clearly occupied some time after European American settlement, and possibly before then. The Mitchell Springs site, near Hawkins Preserve, consists of 9 medium-sized pueblos and believed to have occupied up to 1,000 people at its height. The site shows occupancy from the <b>Basket</b> Makers <b>II</b> period through late Pueblo III period.|$|R

The study will enroll any patient with a solid tumor having evidence of an NTRK/ROS1/ALK fusion, assuming the patient meets all other entry criteria. Examples of such tumor types include NSCLC, mCRC, salivary gland cancer, sarcoma, melanoma, thyroid cancer, glioblastoma, astrocytoma, cholangiocarcinoma, lymphoma and others.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} five early {{approaches to}} the price (and quantity) index number problem. The five approaches are: (1) the fixed <b>basket</b> approach; (<b>ii)</b> the statistical approach; (iii) the test or axiomatic approach; (iv) the Divisia approach and (v) the economic approach. The economic approach makes use of the assumption of optimizing behavior under constraint and the approach is discussed under four subtopics: (i) basic theoretical definitions; (ii) the theory of bounds; (iii) exact index numbers and (iv) econometric estimation of preferences. The paper also discusses several topics raised by Jack Triplett in a recent paper, including: (i) {{the merits of the}} test approach to index number theory, (ii) the chain principle and alternatives to it; (iii) the substitution bias and (iv) the new good bias. Although the paper is for the most part an extensive historical survey, there are a few new results in section 8 on multilateral alternatives to the chain principle. Also in section 6. 3, it is shown that the Paasche, Laspeyres and all superlative indexes will satisfy the circularity test to the first order. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} optimal {{consumption and}} portfolio investment problems of an investor who {{is interested in}} maximizing his utilities from consumption and terminal wealth subject to a random inflation in the consumption basket price over time. We consider two cases: (i) when the investor observes the <b>basket</b> price and (<b>ii)</b> when he receives only noisy observations on the basket price. We derive the optimal policies and show that a modified Mutual Fund Theorem consisting of three funds holds in both cases. The compositions of the funds in the two cases are the same, but in general the investor’s allocations of his wealth into these funds will differ. However, in the particular case when the investor has CRRA utility, his optimal investment allocations into these funds are also the same in both cases.

40|$|Introduction: Molecular {{alterations}} in neurotrophic tyrosine kinase (NTRK) genes {{have been identified}} in several solid tumors including lung cancer. Pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggested their potential role as oncogenic drivers and predictive biomarkers for targeted inhibition, leading to the clinical development of a new class of compounds blocking the NTRK molecular pathway, which are currently undner early clinical investigation. Area covered: This review describes the biology of the NTRK pathway and its molecular {{alterations in}} lung cancer. It focuses on the pre-clinical and clinical development of emerging NTRK inhibitors, which have shown very promising activity in early phase I studies. Expert opinion: Among the several NTRK-inhibitors, entrectinib and LOXO- 101 are those in more advanced stage of clinical development. Both agents have shown encouraging activity along with a tolerable safety profile in patients with different solid tumors harboring NTRK-fusions, emerging as new promising therapeutic options for molecularly selected patients with advanced Trk-driven lung cancers. Results from ongoing phase <b>II</b> <b>basket</b> trials are eagerly awaited...|$|R
40|$|Immunocytochemistry {{has been}} used to study the {{distribution}} of the major 180, 000 -mol wt protein of coated vesicles in rodent cerebellum. An antibody to the coat protein was prepared in rabbits and characterized by immunodiffusion and immunofixation of polyacrylamide gels.

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of digital data is being collected by State Highway Agencies (SHAs) to aid project-planning activities, support various project level decision-making processes, and effectively maintain and operate constructed highway assets. However, the highway construction industry has been significantly lagging behind utilizing the growing digital data to support business decisions compared to other industry sectors {{such as health care}} and energy. The significant lack of understanding on the linkage between raw data collected and various decisions, proper computational methodologies, and effective guidance is considered as major barriers to the full utilization of the digital data. This study uses digital datasets that are now commonly available in SHAs, to demonstrate the smart utilization of existing digital data to support and enhance decision-making processes using data analytics and visualization methods. This study will a) develop an advanced computational methodology to generate multidimensional highway construction cost indexes (HCCIs) using two new concepts of i) dynamic item <b>basket</b> and <b>ii)</b> multidimensional HCCI, b) develop an enhanced framework for collection and utilization of digital Daily work Report (DWR) data, c) develop an automated methodology to generate as-built schedules using data collected from existing DWR systems, and d) analyze as-built schedules to develop a knowledge base of frequent precedence relationships of activities. The study achieves those objectives by utilizing three digital datasets: bid data, DWR data, and project characteristics data. Further, two standalone prototype systems, namely, Dyna-Mu-HCCI and ABSS are developed to automate computational methodologies for multidimensional HCCI calculation and as-built schedule development respectively. This study will aid SHAs to utilize currently unused datasets for informed budgeting and project control decisions. It demonstrates the importance of data analytics and visualization to obtain more value from the investment made in collecting construction data. Overall, this study serves as a step in making a transition from experience driven to data driven decision making in the construction industry...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{a desirable}} transition path for East Asian countries given the People's Republic of China's (PRC's) {{transition to a}} new exchange rate regime. It attempts to answer two main questions: (i) Would these countries be better off shifting to either a basket peg or a floating regime following the PRC's transition to a <b>basket</b> peg regime? (<b>ii)</b> How and when should these countries shift to the desired regime? The paper captures {{the influence of the}} PRC's predetermined shift in its exchange rate regime on East Asian countries' decisions regarding their optimal transition policies based on a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of a small open economy. Our calibration exercise using Malaysian and Singapore data from the first quarter (Q 1) of 2000 to Q 4 2012 reveals that a gradual adjustment to a basket peg is the most desirable policy for both countries. A sudden shift to a basket peg is superior to maintaining a dollar peg in Malaysia, but not in Singapore. Finally, a sudden shift to a floating regime is even worse than maintaining a dollar peg in both countries...|$|R
