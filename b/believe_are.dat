Fitz discovers that Radcliffe has secretly transferred his artificial intelligence AIDA into a human-like body, which he intends {{to be the first}} in a line of decoys for field agents in danger. Believing Radcliffe's altruistic intentions, Fitz agrees to help him perfect Aida, and to keep her a secret from his girlfriend Agent Jemma Simmons, who is in the paranoid Director's inner circle, and takes daily lie-detector tests.

5|$|Stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb, {{along with}} their father Lawrence and sister Candace, go to an Egyptian-themed movie theater where they see a movie about two archeologists who {{discover}} an undead mummy. Phineas and Ferb are inspired {{to find their own}} mummy and go out to the basement of the theater, where there is rumored to be a mummy. Candace sees them going off to do this and follows them, hoping to get them in trouble with their father. However, as Phineas and Ferb go searching for the mummy through the basement hallways wearing archeologist hats, they run into what they <b>believe</b> <b>are</b> booby traps; they avoid the traps but Candace ends up getting hit by them all. Eventually, she becomes caught up in raggy toilet paper and cannot talk properly (due to eating stale bubble gum), which leads to the boys mistaking her for the mummy and capturing her.|$|E

25|$|Modern Republicans {{advocate}} {{the theory of}} supply side economics, which holds that lower tax rates increase economic growth. Many Republicans oppose higher tax rates for higher earners, which they <b>believe</b> <b>are</b> unfairly targeted at those who create jobs and wealth. They believe private spending is more efficient than government spending.|$|E
25|$|Giving What We Can (GWWC) is an {{organization}} which hosts a community of individuals who have pledged to donate at least 10% of their income {{for the remainder of}} their working lives to the causes that they <b>believe</b> <b>are</b> the most effective. GWWC was founded in November 2009 by Toby Ord, a moral philosopher at Oxford University, who lives on £18,000 ($27,000) per year and donates the remainder of his income to charity. As of 2017, more than 2500 individuals took the pledge.|$|E
50|$|The {{plot of the}} {{original}} Escape Velocity involves disputes between the Confederation government and a Rebellion against it. As noted earlier, the player may choose sides (or not) based on who they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> right, who they <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> stronger, who they <b>believe</b> it <b>is</b> more profitable to support, or any other criteria. The player begins with a shuttlecraft resembling those from Star Trek.|$|R

25|$|Autonomy {{can come}} into {{conflict}} with beneficence when patients disagree with recommendations that healthcare professionals <b>believe</b> <b>are</b> in the patient's best interest. When the patient's interests conflict with the patient's welfare, different societies settle the conflict {{in a wide range}} of manners. In general, Western medicine defers to the wishes of a mentally competent patient to make their own decisions, even in cases where the medical team believes that they are not acting in their own best interests. However, many other societies prioritize beneficence over autonomy.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{histories}} of Native Hawaiians and Native Americans are significantly different, {{there is still a}} widely held perception that Native Hawaiians have received similar kinds of unfair treatment from the U.S. Government as Native Americans. The Apology Bill is thus seen as a means of acknowledging historical grievances that they <b>believe</b> <b>are</b> valid. Some also see it as a step towards identifying Native Hawaiians as an indigenous people to preserve for them specific legal rights based on ancestry; some also see it as the beginning of a process to provide compensation or reparation to native Hawaiians for alleged past injustices.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the cape}} is a rock with {{depressions}} {{that the people}} <b>believe</b> <b>are</b> the footprints of Saint Andrew. It is known that in the great shipwreck of 1892, several bodies were found near the cape. Despite being barely inhabited since ancient times, Saint Andrew Chapel {{was built in the}} 16th century and is the burial site of drowned fishermen found in the cape. Fishermen also asked intervention from the saint for better fisheries. Single girls wanting to get married threw a little stone to the roof of the chapel. If the stone remained lodged in the roof they would soon get married.|$|E

25|$|Crossan {{relies heavily}} {{on the work of}} John Kloppenborg, who does not {{outwardly}} support Crossan’s theory. “A documentary hypothesis for the relationship between Q and Thomas must be ruled out.” Kloppenborg points out that there are instances of overlap that scholars <b>believe</b> <b>are</b> Common Sayings Source material found in the wisdom speeches, “Thomas lacks elements present in Q, which had Thomas known Q, would surely have taken over.” Kloppenborg created the stratification theory in Q that Crossan relies on but it seems that Kloppenborg does not agree with the use of his theory to create a comparison between his layering of Q and the layering of the Gospel of Thomas.|$|E
25|$|Opening day on April 8 {{showed the}} largest {{attendance}} {{in the history}} of Busch Stadium with 47,345. The Cardinals had a 4–2 lead after 6 inn. and a 4–3 lead after 7 inn., but the Reds scored a run in the 8th to tie it, and then scored 9 in the 9th to win going away, 13–4. It spoiled a fine performance by starter Jaime García who pitched effecitvely for 6.2 inn., giving up 6 hits, 3 runs, walking 3, and striking out 10. It was the first of 19 games between the two teams the experts <b>believe</b> <b>are</b> the best in the Central, and will battle it out for the title.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the primary}} reasons for {{performing}} arthroscopies is to repair or trim a painful and torn or damaged meniscus. The technical terms for the surgery is arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM). Arthroscopic surgery, however, {{does not appear to}} result in benefits to adults when performed for knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis who have a meniscal tear. This {{may be due to the}} fact that a torn meniscus may often not cause pain and symptoms, which may be caused by the osteoarthritis alone. Some groups have made a strong recommendation against arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in nearly all patients, stating that the only group of patients who may - or may not - benefit are those with a true locked knee. Professional knee societies, however, highlight other symptoms and related factors they <b>believe</b> <b>are</b> important, and continue to support limited use of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy in carefully selected patients.|$|E

25|$|Jehovah's Witnesses {{believe their}} {{allegiance}} belongs to God's Kingdom, which {{they view as}} an actual government. They refrain from saluting the flag of any country or singing nationalistic songs, which they <b>believe</b> <b>are</b> forms of worship, although they may stand out of respect. They also refuse to participate in military serviceeven when it is compulsoryand do not become involved in politics. They believe Jesus' refusal to rule the kingdoms {{of the world as}} offered by the Devil, his refusal to be made king of Israel by the Jews, and his statements that he, his followers, and his kingdom {{are not part of the}} world, provide the bases for not being involved in politics or government. Witnesses are taught that they should obey laws of the governments where they live unless such laws conflict with their beliefs, such as operating covertly in countries where their activities are banned.|$|E
500|$|A lavish temple {{called the}} Elagabalium {{was built on}} the east face of the Palatine Hill to house Elagabal, who was {{represented}} by a black conical meteorite from Emesa. Herodian wrote [...] "this stone is worshipped as though it were sent from heaven; on it there are some small projecting pieces and markings that are pointed out, which the people would like to <b>believe</b> <b>are</b> a rough picture of the sun, because this is how they see them".|$|E
500|$|The poem {{begins with}} a priamel – a rhetorical {{structure}} where a list of alternatives are contrasted with a final, different idea. [...] The first stanza opens {{with a list of}} things which some people <b>believe</b> <b>are</b> the most beautiful in the world: [...] "some say an army of horsemen, others say foot soldiers, still others say a fleet". [...] The poet goes on to propose a more general rule: that in fact superlative beauty is a property of [...] "whatever one loves".|$|E
