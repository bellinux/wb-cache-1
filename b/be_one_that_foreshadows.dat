40|$|The {{claim of}} having {{achieved}} "authenticity" in performance has today almost disappeared without a trace. However, Richard Taruskin's efforts to disprove the premise {{through a series}} of articles in the 1980 s still beg important questions, such as exactly what are the origins of the early music movement's performance style and which performers had a role in its transmission? Taruskin contends that Stravinsky transmitted the "geometrical," or modernist, Bach to the musical world, and that Stravinsky might have learned it from Wanda Landowska. Taruskin's accolade exposes more than a bit of irony within the early-music revival, since Landowska is seldom, if ever, acknowledged as a significant contributor {{to the development of the}} early-music "style" of performance, even though Landowska's recordings reveal a performer with a modern style, <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>foreshadows</b> 1980 s early-music performances. Due primarily to the sound of her non-historic harpsichord, Landowska's influence, however, has been diminished, and her significant role was negated in the post-"authenticity" early music movement. This paper traces Landowska's central influence through an investigation of her Varsovian musical education, Parisian residency, and recordings. It recognizes and advocates for the contributions made by Landowska before the advent of the "authenticity" era...|$|R

[...] The film may also take place more in the real world than in the past according to the recent interview: [...] "That’s what I’m told, but you didn’t hear me say that," [...] Boxleitner joked.
