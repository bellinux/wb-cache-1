A mobile-cloud framework is developed, which facilitates the use of mobile devices to manipulate and interact with the scientific workflows running in the Cloud. In this framework, an independent trusted accountability service is used to provide data provenance and enforce compliance among the participants of a <b>bioinformatic</b> workflow. We have implemented a prototype which allows the <b>bioinformatic</b> workflow design and participation using mobile devices. We prove the concept of mobile-cloud with the prototype and conducted performance evaluation for the significant points of the <b>bioinformatic</b> workflow.

40|$|The use of <b>Bioinformatic</b> {{tools in}} routine {{clinical}} diagnostics is still facing {{a number of}} issues. The more complex and advanced <b>bioinformatic</b> tools become, the more performance is required by the computing platforms.

Notable SIG meetings include the <b>Bioinformatics</b> Open Source Conference (BOSC), which has been held annually since 2000 and Bio-Ontologies, which has been held annually since 1998.
