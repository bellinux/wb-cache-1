5|$|By {{the time}} of the Korean War air power had been {{supplemented}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the jet engine, which allowed fighter and bomber aircraft to fly faster. As with their World War II predecessors, the newer jet aircraft proved capable of providing close air support for ground based troops, and were instrumental in aiding UN ground forces during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Damage from Hypera postica, the alfalfa weevil, {{a serious}} {{introduced}} pest of forage, was substantially reduced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> natural enemies. 20 {{years after their}} introduction the population of weevils in the alfalfa area treated for alfalfa weevil in the Northeastern United States remained 75 percent down.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{large-scale}} immigration was facilitated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> steamships (from 1823). By 1840, up to 5,000 English people, mostly half-pay {{officers and}} their families, {{had settled in}} Jersey. In the aftermath of 1848, Polish, Russian, Hungarian, Italian and French political refugees came to Jersey. Following Louis Napoléon's coup of 1851, more French proscrits arrived. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, well-to-do British families, attracted by the lack of income tax, were settling in Jersey in increasing numbers, establishing St Helier as a predominantly English-speaking town.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, Australian swimmer and {{performer}} Annette Kellerman {{was arrested}} on a Boston beach for wearing form-fitting sleeveless one-piece knitted swimming tights that covered her from neck to toe, a costume she adopted from England, although it became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910. In 1913, designer Carl Jantzen made the first functional two-piece swimwear. Inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> females into Olympic swimming he designed a close-fitting costume with shorts for the bottom and short sleeves for the top.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Suffolk {{was often}} criticised for its poor feet, having hooves {{that were too}} small for its body mass. This was {{corrected}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> classes at major shows in which hoof conformation and structure were judged. This practice, unique among horse breeds, resulted in such an improvement that the Suffolk Punch is now considered to have excellent foot conformation.|$|E
5|$|Rowlands {{argues that}} {{the problem with the}} book's central {{approach}} is that it assumes that all interests have a clear relation to welfare and thus moral considerability; an assumption which, he argues, is partially undermined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> biological interests. Jon Jensen, who reviewed the book for Ethics and the Environment, raised a similar worry, arguing that Varner did not sufficiently justify his claim that biological interests are inherently morally significant.|$|E
50|$|DeLauro {{introduced}} HR 875, the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2009. This {{legislation is}} aimed at reforming the food safety responsibilities handled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> FDA. <b>The</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> this bill represents a potential conflict of interest, because of her husband's, Stanley Greenberg, relation to agricultural biotechnology corporation Monsanto.|$|R

25|$|The year 2001 saw <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> digital {{terrestrial}} television in Australia with transmissions available to most of SBS Television's coverage area on 1 January 2001, this was soon followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> gradual <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> widescreen programming.|$|R
5|$|The eastern (Chatham) side, {{comprising}} platforms 1–8, is the terminus for Southeastern {{services to}} Kent on the Chatham Main Line and its branches. This {{is also the}} London terminus for the Venice Simplon Orient Express, from Platform 2, the longest platform. It was used for boat trains to Dover and Folkestone until these were made redundant <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> Eurostar trains to the continent in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had {{resulted}} in periods of famine and chronic unemployment, exacerbated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> {{the first of the}} Corn Laws. By the beginning of 1819, the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the relative lack of suffrage in Northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism. In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, organised a demonstration to be addressed by the well-known radical orator Henry Hunt.|$|E
5|$|The house {{system was}} {{established}} by Dr. John Marden, shortly after {{the opening of the}} school, with three houses: East, West and Boarders. In 1924 the senior houses were reorganised and renamed Kinross, Harper and Ferguson (with Anderson added in 1968), followed in 1926 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> junior houses, named Vicars and McQueen (with Thompson added in 1937).|$|E
2500|$|Starting in the 2000s, Harris Teeter {{attempted}} to differentiate itself from its competitors by providing exceptional {{customer service and}} newly [...] "branded" [...] departments. The first department to be [...] "branded" [...] was the meat department, which in June 2002 began offering [...] "Harris Teeter Rancher" [...] beef. This was followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introductions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Farmers' Market (produce department, October 2003), the Fisherman's Market (seafood department, April 2004), and the Fresh Foods Market (deli/bakery, January 2005).

30|$|Fluorescence-based {{biological}} imaging has been revolutionized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> recent <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> superresolution microscopy methods. 3 D superresolution microscopy, however, remains a challenge as its implementation by existing superresolution methods is non-trivial.|$|R
5|$|The longer 7.5cm {{guns were}} a mixed blessing. In {{spite of the}} designers' efforts to {{conserve}} weight, the new weapon made the vehicle nose-heavy {{to such an extent}} that the forward suspension springs were under constant compression. This resulted in the tank tending to sway even when no steering was being applied, an effect compounded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the Ausführung H in March 1943.|$|E
5|$|A fresh wave of {{concerns}} about France followed in the 1880s, accompanied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> still more powerful naval artillery and fast warships and torpedo boats, resulting in a fresh wave of modernisation. An electronically-operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from St Mawes and Pendennis. New, quick-firing guns were installed at Hurst to enable the castle to engage the newer vessels. Calshot was brought back into service as a coastal fort, with a new battery of quick-firing guns protecting a boom across the estuary. The original 16th-century parts of fortifications such as Southsea and Calshot were too small and unsuitable for modern weapons, however, and were instead used for mounting searchlights, range and direction finding; in some cases their fabric was left to slowly decline.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{exist in}} an {{alternate}} Domain, and {{are referred to}} as creatures with no natural defenses. Most believe that they are fictional creatures; but a few, including the Dewclaws, know that they exist. This was developed further in 2003 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the character Danielle, a human who enters the animal world via the Bermuda Triangle and transforms into a rabbit. However, she later has a son, Francis, who is born human. The series features jokes on a variety of topics. Many draw satirical parallels between its world and ours, making fun and sometimes social commentary on politics, sports, society, class-snobbery, school, technology, pop culture and corporate culture, for example; in January 2008 the Predator's Union was described as going on strike, in a parody of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike.|$|E
50|$|Production {{ended in}} 1890 after {{which time the}} arsenals had {{produced}} nearly 950,000 rifles; however <b>by</b> 1888 <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Lebel using smokeless powder and smaller diameter high velocity bullets, made this weapon obsolete.|$|R
25|$|Railways {{were made}} {{practical}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> widespread <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> inexpensive puddled iron after 1800, the rolling mill for making rails, {{and the development}} of the high pressure steam engine also around 1800.|$|R
50|$|Lieutenant-Governor Sir Francis Bond Head and his administrators {{read the}} act during the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837. The malcontented Canadians were assuaged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{eventual}} <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> responsible government in Canada.|$|R
5|$|In January 1990, Cathay Pacific, Swire Group and CITIC Pacific {{acquired}} an 89 {{percent stake in}} the airline, with CITIC Pacific holding 38 percent; while the family of the airline's chairman Kuang-Piu Chao reduced their holding from 22 percent to 6 percent, with the remainder held by minor shareholders. The change of ownership saw Cathay Pacific transferring its Beijing and Shanghai routes to Dragonair, along with a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar on a lease basis. The first Airbus A320 joined the airline's fleet in March 1993 and by December, there was a total of six A320 aircraft. This was followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the Airbus A330 wide-body aircraft into the Dragonair's fleet in July 1995.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{truncation}} spurs can {{be reduced}} substantially <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> white gaussian noise prior to truncation. The so-called dither noise is summed into the lower W+1 bits of the PA output word to linearize the truncation operation. Often the improvement can be achieved without penalty because the DAC noise floor tends to dominate system performance. Amplitude truncation spurs can not be mitigated in this fashion. Introduction of noise into the static values held in the PAC ROMs would not eliminate the cyclicality of the truncation error terms and thus would not achieve the desired effect.|$|E
5|$|That same year, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) was established, {{becoming}} the international governing body for track and field, and it enshrined amateurism {{as one of}} its founding principles for the sport. The National Collegiate Athletic Association held their first Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship in 1921, {{making it one of the}} most prestigious competitions for students, and this was soon followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> track and field at the inaugural World Student Games in 1923. The first continental track and field competition was the 1919 South American Championships, which was followed by the European Athletics Championships in 1934.|$|E

5000|$|The {{right to}} {{education}} has been recognized as a human right {{in a number of}} international conventions, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which recognises a right to free, compulsory primary education for all, an obligation to develop secondary education accessible to all, in particular <b>by</b> <b>the</b> progressive <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> free secondary education, as well as an obligation to develop equitable access to higher education, ideally <b>by</b> <b>the</b> progressive <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> free higher education. Today, almost 70 million children across the world are prevented from going to school each day. As of 2015, 164 states were parties to the Covenant.|$|R
50|$|The EGA {{standard}} was made obsolete <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> in 1987 <b>of</b> MCGA and VGA with the PS/2 computer line.|$|R
5|$|The Lord Howe Island {{stick insect}} {{disappeared}} from the main island soon after the introduction of rats in 1918. In 2001 a tiny population was discovered in a single Melaleuca howeana shrub {{on the slopes of}} Ball's Pyramid, has been successfully bred in captivity, and is nearing re-introduction to the main island. The Lord Howe stag beetle is a colourful endemic beetle seen during summer months. Another endemic invertebrate, the Lord Howe flax snail (or Lord Howe Placostylus), has also been affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> rats. Once common, the species is now endangered and a captive breeding program is under way to save the snail from extinction.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{has many}} {{similarities}} with the Picardy Spaniel {{due to the}} two breeds' recent history. The Blue Spaniel is described as being softer, {{as well as the}} obvious difference in coat color. The Picardy has a brown coat whereas the Blue Picardy has a black and grey coat, which was brought into the breed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> English Setter blood. Similar in the modern era due to the close similarities of the two different breed standards. In addition, the Blue Picardy is a little faster, and has a slightly finer nose.|$|E
5|$|Thrones and Patriots added six new {{nations to}} the {{original}} Rise of Nations game. The 'New World' situation playable in the game was enhanced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> the European nation—the Dutch. Three North American nations were added, the Americans, referring to the ex-colonial civilization, and two Native American nations were added, which were the Lakota and the Iroquois. Two Asian nations, the Indians and the Persians, were introduced. The other nation to be added was the Dutch. New Wonders were made available for building, such as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Forbidden City, and the Red Fort.|$|E
50|$|As {{the mythology}} {{related to the}} Kunlun developed, it became {{influenced}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> later <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> ideas about an axis mundi from the cosmology of India. The Kunlun became identified with (or took on the attributes of) Mount Sumeru.|$|R
50|$|The {{music of}} the Torres Strait is principally vocal {{accompanied}} <b>by</b> instruments. <b>The</b> <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> Christianity through <b>the</b> London Missionary Society, beginning in 1871, had a profound influence, but before that time the musical culture reflected the cultural and geographic diversity of the Strait.|$|R
25|$|The mills {{which had}} {{superseded}} the ancient bolehills {{in the late}} 16th century, a development described above in section 3, were themselves superseded in <b>the</b> 18th century <b>by</b> <b>the</b> gradual <b>introduction</b> <b>of</b> {{a new type of}} furnace known as the cupola.|$|R
