5|$|The Gram-negative {{bacterial}} disease <b>brucellosis</b> occasionally affects elk in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, {{the only place}} in the U.S. where the disease is still known to exist. In domesticated cattle, <b>brucellosis</b> causes infertility, abortions and reduced milk production. It is transmitted to humans as undulant fever, producing flu-like symptoms which may last for years. Though bison are more likely to transmit the disease to other animals, elk inadvertently transmitted <b>brucellosis</b> to horses in Wyoming and cattle in Idaho. Researchers are attempting to eradicate the disease through vaccinations and herd management measures, which are expected to be successful. Nevetheless, research has been ongoing since 2002, and a successful vaccine has yet to be developed as of 2016.|$|E
5|$|To {{combat the}} {{perceived}} threat of <b>brucellosis</b> transmission to cattle, national park personnel regularly harass bison herds {{back into the}} park when they venture outside of the area's borders. During the winter of 1996–97, the bison herd was so large that 1,079 bison that had exited the park were shot or sent to slaughter. Animal rights activists argue {{that this is a}} cruel practice and that the possibility for disease transmission is not as great as some ranchers maintain. Ecologists point out that the bison are merely traveling to seasonal grazing areas that lie within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem that have been converted to cattle grazing, some of which are within National Forests and are leased to private ranchers. APHIS has stated that with vaccinations and other means, <b>brucellosis</b> can be eliminated from the bison and elk herds throughout Yellowstone.|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{bacteriology}} in the 20th century increased {{the sophistication of}} possible bio-agents in war. Biological sabotage—in the form of anthrax and glanders—was undertaken {{on behalf of the}} Imperial German government during World War I, with indifferent results. In World War II, Britain weaponised tularemia, anthrax, <b>brucellosis,</b> and botulism toxins, but never used them.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, the {{building}} was converted into the head office of the Public Health Department. The department was eventually succeeded by Malta's health ministry (currently known as the Ministry for Health, the Elderly and Community Care), which is still housed in the Castellania. The building's ground floor contains a number of shops, while the belongings of Sir Themistocles Zammit's laboratory are now housed at the second floor and {{is open to the}} public by appointment as The <b>Brucellosis</b> Museum.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include <b>brucellosis,</b> lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Governments are {{particularly}} concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases {{that can affect}} domestic animals which may acquire them {{as a result of}} insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include rabies, leptospirosis, <b>brucellosis,</b> tuberculosis and trichinosis.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{the most}} {{important}} rabies vector in Europe. In London, arthritis is not uncommon in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine. Foxes may be infected with leptospirosis and tularemia, though they are not overly susceptible to the latter. They may also fall ill from listeriosis and spirochetosis, as well as acting as vectors in spreading erysipelas, <b>brucellosis</b> and tick-born encephalitis. A mysterious fatal disease near Lake Sartlan in the Novosibirsk Oblast was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of encephalomyelitis, which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with Yersinia pestis are known.|$|E
5|$|In June 1904, {{during the}} experiments, Zammit {{learned that a}} Maltese family of five members became {{simultaneously}} ill after consuming fresh unpasteurized milk from goats. Zammit decided to purchase healthy goats and tested them, {{and at one point}} also kept them {{on the first floor of}} the Castellania (then known as the public health building or the variants). Zammit was successful in the discovery of the disease. David Bruce, who led the MFC, discouraged the experiments when proposed by Zammit. However, when the experiment concluded in the discovery, Bruce tried to discredit Zammit by taking the merit for himself. Information about the role of Zammit was kept low profile or ignored. The fever was renamed after Bruce, as <b>brucellosis.</b> The MFC managed to find cure and ways to eradicate the fever, but had a hard time since there was lack of cooperation with sellers and consumers of milk, some dismissing or ignoring the finding. It was under control by 1938, with the enforcement of standard procedures of pasteurizing milk. However, slaughtering of infected animals continued throughout the 20th century and there was another rising challenge for the department in 1994 and 1995.|$|E
5|$|The {{laboratory}} on the Castellania's {{second floor}} {{which was used}} by the Malta Fever Commission was restored and converted into The <b>Brucellosis</b> Museum in 1980, and it is now open to the public by appointment. Since the British period some of the prison cells were modified and converted into government offices and at present still serve this purpose. Other parts of the Castellania's interior, including the chapel and one of the prison cells, were restored in the 1990s. The restored cell appears on the front cover of the book Kissing the Gallows: A Cultural History of Crime, Torture and Punishment in Malta, 1600–1798, authored by William Zammit. There were further plans to restore the façade in the late 1990s, but nothing materialized. The façade is again on plan to be restored as part of a number of projects of the Valletta 2018 - European Capital of Culture. A detailed study for the restoration of the façade has taken place, which gave the way to call for a public tender, and work began in June 2017.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas may {{contract}} <b>brucellosis,</b> rinderpest and anaplasmosis. They {{are vulnerable}} to Trypanosoma congolense, which is contracted by consuming already infected herbivores, rather than through direct infection from tsetse flies. It is known that adult spotted hyenas in the Serengeti have antibodies against rabies, canine herpes, canine brucella, canine parvovirus, feline calici, leptospirosis, bovine brucella, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. During the canine distemper outbreak of 1993–94, molecular studies indicated that the viruses isolated from hyenas and lions were {{more closely related to}} each other than to the closest canine distemper virus in dogs. Evidence of canine distemper in spotted hyenas has also been recorded in the Masai Mara. Exposure to rabies does not cause clinical symptoms or affect individual survival or longevity. Analyses of several hyena saliva samples showed that the species is unlikely to be a rabies vector, thus indicating that the species catches the disease from other animals rather than from intraspecifics. The microfilaria of Dipetalonema dracuneuloides have been recorded in spotted hyenas in northern Kenya. The species is known to carry at least three cestode species of the genus Taenia, none of which are harmful to humans. It also carries protozoan parasites of the genus Hepatozoon in the Serengeti, Kenya and South Africa. Spotted hyenas may act as hosts in the life-cycles of various parasites which start life in herbivores; Taenia hyaenae and T. olnogojinae occur in hyenas in their adult phase. Trichinella spiralis are found as cysts in hyena muscles.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, the 1950s saw the weaponization of plague, <b>brucellosis,</b> {{tularemia}} {{and later}} equine encephalomyelitis and vaccinia viruses, but the programme was unilaterally cancelled in 1956. The United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories weaponized anthrax, tularemia, <b>brucellosis,</b> Q-fever and others.|$|E
25|$|<b>Brucellosis</b> is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} bacterial disease {{that can cause}} uveitis, abortion, and orchitis in dogs.|$|E
25|$|The {{first-line}} {{for treatment}} <b>brucellosis</b> is combination of doxycycline and streptomycin and the second-line is combination of doxyxycline and rifampicin (rifampin).|$|E
25|$|Tetracycline, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Sumycin among others, is an {{antibiotic}} used to treat a number of infections. This includes acne, cholera, <b>brucellosis,</b> plague, malaria, and syphilis. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|Diseases {{considered}} for or {{known to be}} used as a weapon include anthrax, ebola, Marburg virus, plague, cholera, typhus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, <b>brucellosis,</b> Q fever, machupo, Coccidioides mycosis, Glanders, Melioidosis, Shigella, Psittacosis, Japanese B encephalitis, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, and smallpox.|$|E
25|$|Tetracyclines {{remain the}} {{treatment}} of choice for infections caused by chlamydia (trachoma, psittacosis, salpingitis, urethritis and L. venereum infection), Rickettsia (typhus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), <b>brucellosis</b> and spirochetal infections (borreliosis, syphilis and Lyme disease). In addition, they {{may be used to}} treat anthrax, plague, tularemia and Legionnaires' disease. They are also used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Poor {{sanitation}} {{is perhaps}} the South Province's greatest health hazard. Many villages {{have no access to}} running water, and even areas that do have it must contend with outbreaks of amoebic dysentery, bacterial dysentery, <b>brucellosis,</b> giardia, hepatitis A, and schistosomiasis. In 2004, the relatively developed town of Kribi suffered a major cholera epidemic.|$|E
25|$|When the USA {{entered the}} war, Allied {{resources}} were pooled {{at the request}} of the British and the U.S. established a large research program and industrial complex at Fort Detrick, Maryland in 1942 under the direction of George W. Merck. The biological and chemical weapons developed during that period were tested at the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah. Soon there were facilities for the mass production of anthrax spores, <b>brucellosis,</b> and botulism toxins, although the war was over before these weapons could be of much operational use.|$|E
25|$|Infections {{that are}} {{transmitted}} from animals to humans are called zoonoses. Some zoonoses may be transferred through casual contact, {{but others are}} much more readily transferred by activities that expose humans to the semen, vaginal fluids, urine, saliva, feces and blood of animals. Examples of zoonoses are <b>Brucellosis,</b> Q fever, leptospirosis, and toxocariasis. Therefore, sexual activity with animals is, in some instances, a high risk activity. Allergic reactions to animal semen may occur, including anaphylaxis. Bites and other trauma from penetration or trampling may occur.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{collected}} or {{stored in}} unsanitary conditions may harbor {{a host of}} disease-causing organisms (pathogens), such as tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), the bacteria Campylobacter (Campylobacteriosis), Escherichia E. coli O157:H7), Listeria (Listeriosis), Salmonella (Salmonellosis), Yersinia (Yersinia enterocolitica), and Brucella (<b>Brucellosis).</b> Pasteurization consistently removes all of these pathogens, though they can be reintroduced if the product is handled carelessly. Thus dairy farms that pasteurize their milk can have unsanitary facilities without the attendant outbreaks of disease that would occur if a raw milk dairy kept its herds in similar unsanitary conditions.|$|E
25|$|They became feral and {{are causing}} {{significant}} environmental damage. Buffalo {{are also found}} in the Top End. As a result, they were hunted in the Top End from 1885 until 1980. The commencement of the <b>brucellosis</b> and tuberculosis campaign (BTEC) resulted in a huge culling program to reduce buffalo herds to a fraction of the numbers that were reached in the 1980s. The BTEC was finished when the Northern Territory was declared free of the disease in 1997. Numbers dropped dramatically {{as a result of the}} campaign, but have since recovered to an estimated 150,000 animals across northern Australia in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Early {{conservation}} efforts {{to preserve the}} iconic bison were ultimately undermined by the federal government's goal of domesticating northern bison populations for commercial purposes. The utilitarian, scientific approach to bison management prevented the state from comprehending the complexity of local ecosystems and human cultures. The narrow focus on production resulted in poor federal wildlife management decisions, such as the transfer of thousands of plains bison from the overpopulated range in Buffalo National Park to the supposedly understocked range in Wood Buffalo National. The transfer had disastrous ecological consequences, including hybridization between the plains and wood bison species and the infection of the northern herds with tuberculosis and <b>brucellosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The northward {{shift of}} the subarctic climate zone is {{allowing}} animals that are adapted to that climate {{to move into the}} far north, where they are replacing species that are more adapted to a pure Arctic climate. Where the Arctic species are not being replaced outright, they are often interbreeding with their southern relations. Among slow-breeding vertebrate species, this often has the effect of reducing the genetic diversity of the genus. Another concern is the spread of infectious diseases, such as <b>brucellosis</b> or phocine distemper virus, to previously untouched populations. This is a particular danger among marine mammals who were previously segregated by sea ice.|$|E
25|$|Wild boars are an {{invasive}} {{species in the}} Americas, and cause problems including outcompeting native species for food, destroying the nests of ground-nesting species, killing fawns and young domestic livestock, destroying agricultural crops, eating tree seeds and seedlings, destroying native vegetation and wetlands through wallowing, damaging water quality, coming into violent conflict with humans and pets, and carrying pig and human diseases including <b>brucellosis,</b> trichinosis, and pseudorabies. In some jurisdictions, {{it is illegal to}} import, breed, release, possess, sell, distribute, trade, transport, hunt, or trap Eurasian boars. Hunting and trapping is done systematically, to increase the chance of eradication and to remove the incentive to illegally release boars, which have mostly been spread deliberately by sport hunters.|$|E
25|$|With {{the onset}} of World War II, the Ministry of Supply in the United Kingdom {{established}} a BW program at Porton Down, headed by the microbiologist Paul Fildes. The research was championed by Winston Churchill and soon tularemia, anthrax, <b>brucellosis,</b> and botulism toxins had been effectively weaponized. In particular, Gruinard Island in Scotland, was contaminated with anthrax during a series of extensive tests for the next 56 years. Although the UK never offensively used the biological weapons it developed on its own, its program {{was the first to}} successfully weaponize a variety of deadly pathogens and bring them into industrial production. Other nations, notably France and Japan, had begun their own biological weapons programs.|$|E
25|$|The Bison Range Ride and Roundup - {{held every}} autumn attracts {{tourists}} {{from around the}} United States and the World. Bison are herded from {{the southern end of}} the island to holding pens on the northern end of the island. There the bison are vaccinated for parasites, infectious bovine rhino tracheitis, clostridium and bovine vibriosis. DNA and blood samples are taken. The bison are tagged with microchips and weighed and measured. The female bison are also vaccinated for <b>brucellosis</b> and checked for pregnancy. With the goal of keeping the herd at a manageable level the excess bison, about 150 - 200 head, are auctioned off in an annual sale that nets about $120,000 for the park.|$|E
25|$|Pasteurization {{was first}} used in the United States in the 1890s after the {{discovery}} of germ theory to control the hazards of highly contagious bacterial diseases, including bovine tuberculosis and <b>brucellosis,</b> that could be easily transmitted to humans through the drinking of raw milk. Initially after the scientific discovery of bacteria, no product testing was available {{to determine if a}} farmer's milk was safe or infected, so all milk had to be treated as potentially contagious. After the first test was developed, some farmers actively worked to prevent their infected animals from being killed and removed from food production, or would falsify the test results so that their animals would appear to be free of infection.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} {{that as a result}} of {{inflammation}} of the facial nerve, pressure is produced on the nerve where it exits the skull within its bony canal (the stylomastoid foramen), blocking the transmission of neural signals or damaging the nerve. Patients with facial palsy for which an underlying cause can be found are not considered to have Bell's palsy per se. Possible causes include tumor, meningitis, stroke, diabetes mellitus, head trauma and inflammatory diseases of the cranial nerves (sarcoidosis, <b>brucellosis,</b> etc.). In these conditions, the neurologic findings are rarely restricted to the facial nerve. Babies can be born with facial palsy. In a few cases, bilateral facial palsy has been associated with acute HIV infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} had already paid substantial compensation to farmers {{because of the}} foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 followed by the bluetongue outbreak in 2007, {{against the background of}} EC Directives 77/391 and 78/52 on eradication of tuberculosis, <b>brucellosis</b> or enzootic bovine leucosis. In the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak, a total of £1.4 billion in compensation was paid. The Cattle Compensation (England) Order 2006 (SI2006/168) was overturned when the High Court decided the Order was unlawful; in the test case, farmers had been receiving compensation payments of around £1,000 on animals valued at over £3,000, but in extreme cases the discrepancy between animal value and compensation paid was over one thousand percent. This case was itself overturned on appeal in 2009.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, only 300 wood bison {{remained}} worldwide, {{almost exclusively in}} Wood Buffalo National Park. During the 1920s, 6000-7000 plains bison were also relocated to Wood Buffalo National Park. These bison were not only infected with <b>brucellosis</b> and tuberculosis, which infected the wood bison herd, but the wood and plains subspecies also interbred, and thus {{it was thought that}} wood bison were completely extinct by the 1940s. In 1957, however, a disease-free, wood bison herd of 200 was discovered near Nyarling river in Wood Buffalo National Park. In 1965, 23 of these bison were relocated to the south side of Elk Island National Park and remain there today as the most genetically pure wood bison remaining. In 2007, the wood bison population in Elk Island National Park was estimated at 315.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1960s, the {{chemical}} warfare capabilities of the United States began to decline due to, in part, a decline in public opinion concerning the corps. The corps continued to be plagued with bad press and mishaps. A 1969 incident, in which 23 soldiers and one Japanese civilian were exposed to sarin {{on the island of}} Okinawa while cleaning sarin-filled bombs, created international concern while revealing the presence of chemical munitions in Southeast Asia. The same year as this sarin mishap, President Richard Nixon reaffirmed a no first-use policy on chemical weapons as well as renouncing the use of biological agents. When the U.S. BW program ended in 1969, it had developed seven standardized biological weapons in the form of agents that cause anthrax, tularemia, <b>brucellosis,</b> Q-fever, VEE, and botulism. In addition, Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B was produced as an incapacitating agent.|$|E
500|$|The USA {{similarly}} explored {{biological warfare}} agents, developing anthrax spores, <b>brucellosis,</b> and botulism toxins for possible military use. Japan developed biological warfare agents, {{with the use}} of [...] experiments on human prisoners, and was about to use them when the war ended.|$|E
500|$|The {{dromedary}} {{is prone}} to trypanosomiasis, a disease caused by a parasite transmitted by the tsetse fly. The main symptoms are recurring fever, anaemia and weakness; the disease is typically fatal for the camel. <b>Brucellosis</b> is another prominent malady. In an observational study, the seroprevalence of this disease was generally low (2 to 5%) in nomadic or moderately free dromedaries, but it was higher (8 to 15%) in denser populations. <b>Brucellosis</b> is caused by different biotypes of Brucella abortus and B. melitensis. Other internal parasites include Fasciola gigantica (trematode), two types of [...] cestode (tapeworm) and various nematodes (roundworms). Among external parasites, Sarcoptes species cause sarcoptic mange. In a 2000 study in Jordan, 83% of the 32 camels studied tested positive for sarcoptic mange. In another study, dromedaries {{were found to have}} natural antibodies against the rinderpest and ovine rinderpest viruses.|$|E
500|$|The Yellowstone Park bison herd is {{the largest}} public herd of American bison in the United States. The {{relatively}} large bison populations are a concern for ranchers, who fear that the species can transmit bovine diseases to their domesticated cousins. In fact, about half of Yellowstone's bison {{have been exposed to}} <b>brucellosis,</b> a bacterial disease that came to North America with European cattle that may cause cattle to miscarry. The disease has little effect on park bison, and no reported case of transmission from wild bison to domestic livestock has been filed. However, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated that bison are the [...] "likely source" [...] of the spread of the disease in cattle in Wyoming and North Dakota. Elk also carry the disease and are believed to have transmitted the infection to horses and cattle. Bison once numbered between 30 and 60 million individuals throughout North America, and Yellowstone remains one of their last strongholds. Their populations had increased from less than 50 in the park in 1902 to 4,000 by 2003. The Yellowstone Park bison herd reached a peak in 2005 with 4,900 animals. Despite a summer estimated population of 4,700 in 2007, the number dropped to 3,000 in 2008 after a harsh winter and controversial <b>brucellosis</b> management sending hundreds to slaughter. The Yellowstone Park bison herd is believed to be one of only four free roaming and genetically pure herds on public lands in North America. The other three herds are the Henry Mountains bison herd of Utah, at Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota and in Elk Island National Park in Alberta.|$|E
500|$|The {{guinea pig}} was most {{extensively}} implemented {{in research and}} diagnosis of infectious diseases. Common uses included identification of <b>brucellosis,</b> Chagas disease, cholera, diphtheria, foot-and-mouth disease, glanders, Q fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and various strains of typhus. They are still frequently used to diagnose tuberculosis, since they are easily infected by human tuberculosis bacteria. Because guinea pigs {{are one of the}} few animals which, like humans and other primates, cannot synthesize vitamin C, but must obtain it from their diet, they are ideal for researching scurvy. From the accidental discovery in 1907 that scurvy could be induced in guinea pigs, to their use to prove the chemical structure of the [...] "ascorbutic factor" [...] in 1932, the guinea pig model proved a crucial part of vitamin C research.|$|E
