5000|$|<b>Compass</b> <b>Box</b> is a producer, bottler and {{marketer}} of a {{range of}} blended Scotch whiskies. The company is headquartered in Chiswick. <b>Compass</b> <b>Box</b> Whisky was founded in 2000 by American entrepreneur John Glaser, a former marketing director at Johnnie Walker. Their main product line, called the Signature Range, consists of whiskies named 'The Spice Tree', 'The Peat Monster', 'Oak Cross', 'Asyla' and 'Hedonism'. Outside the Signature Range, they produce a range of Blended Scotch whiskies called 'Great King Street', within which there are two products: 'Artist's Blend' (a rich, round, fruity blend) and 'Glasgow Blend' (a bold, smoky, sherried whisky made in the style historically favoured by Glaswegians). They have also released several Limited Edition releases, such as 'Hedonism Maximus', 'Flaming Heart', 'Optimism', 'Morpheus' and the Canto Cask series. Apart from whiskies, they also produce 'Orangerie', made from whisky infused with orange zest and spices.|$|R

5000|$|The 32-point compass {{used for}} {{navigation}} in the Mediterranean by the 14th century, had increments of 11° between points. Only the eight principal winds (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) were given special names. The eight half-winds just combined {{the names of}} the two principal winds, e.g. Greco-Tramontana for NNE, Greco-Levante for ENE, and so on. Quarter-winds were more cumbersomely phrased, with the closest principal wind named first and the next-closest principal wind second, e.g. [...] "Quarto di Tramontana verso Greco" [...] (literally, [...] "one quarter wind from North towards Northeast", i.e. North by East), and [...] "Quarto di Greco verso Tramontana" [...] ("one quarter wind from NE towards N", i.e. Northeast by North). <b>Boxing</b> the <b>compass</b> (naming all 32 winds) was expected of all Medieval mariners.|$|R

5000|$|The {{name of a}} quarter-wind is [...] "X by Y", where X is a {{principal}} wind and Y is a cardinal wind. As a mnemonic device, {{it is useful to}} think of [...] "X by Y" [...] as a shortcut for the phrase [...] "one quarter wind from X towards Y", where a [...] "quarter" [...] is °, X is the nearest principal wind, and Y the next (more distant) cardinal wind. So [...] "northeast by east" [...] means [...] "one quarter from NE towards E", [...] "southwest by south" [...] means [...] "one quarter from SW towards S". The eight principal winds, eight half-winds and sixteen quarter winds together yield a 32-wind compass rose, with each compass direction point at ° angle from the next. In the mariner's exercise of <b>boxing</b> the <b>compass,</b> all thirty-two points of the compass are named in clockwise order.|$|R
50|$|In the book, della Porta also {{mentioned}} an imaginary device {{known as a}} sympathetic telegraph. The device consisted of two circular <b>boxes,</b> similar to <b>compasses,</b> each with a magnetic needle, supposed to be magnetized by the same lodestone. Each box was to be labeled with the 26 letters, {{instead of the usual}} directions. Della Porta assumed that this would coordinate the needles such that when a letter was dialed in one box, the needle in the other box would swing to point to the same letter, thereby helping in communicating.|$|R

5000|$|The {{propeller}} revolutions {{are counted}} via a simple mechanism that gears down the revolutions and counts them on an indicator dial.

The ball falls into one of thirty-six compartments {{in the bottom of}} the <b>compass</b> <b>box</b> that indicate direction in increments of 10 degrees. If the direction changes while the measurement is being performed the balls will drop into separate compartments and a weighted mean is taken to determine the average current direction.|$|R

He could no more <b>box</b> the <b>compass</b> than I could mix drinks like Roberts here. And as for steering, he gave me my first gray hairs. I never dared risk him at the wheel when we were running in a big sea, while full-and-by and close-and-by were {{insoluble}} mysteries.

But he was always cheerful, never seasick, and he was the most willing man I ever knew. He was an uncommunicative soul. Never talked about himself.

6000|$|We {{got what}} we could out of {{the boys in the}} meanwhile. Provincetown boys are of course all sailors and have sailors' eyes. When we were at the Highland Light the last summer, seven or eight miles from Provincetown Harbor, and wished to know one Sunday morning if the Olata, a {{well-known}} yacht, had got in from Boston, so that we could return in her, a Provincetown boy about ten years old, who chanced to be at the table, remarked that she had. I asked him how he knew. [...] "I just saw her come in," [...] said he. When I expressed surprise that he could distinguish her from other vessels so far, he said that there were not so many of those two-topsail schooners about but that he could tell her. Palfrey said, in his oration at Barnstable, the duck does not take to the water with a surer instinct than the Barnstable boy. [He might have said the Cape Cod boy as well.] He leaps from his leading-strings into the shrouds, it is but a bound from the mother's lap to the masthead.

6000|$|My {{next step}} was to ascend the [...] "Olo' Mpongwe," [...] or Gaboon River, which Bowdich ("Sketch of Gaboon") calls Oroöngo, and its main point Ohlombopolo. The object was to visit the Fán, of whose {{cannibalism}} such curious tales had been told. It was not easy to find a conveyance. The factory greatly wanted a flat-bottom iron steamer, a stern-wheeler, with sliding keel, and furnaces fit for burning half-dried wood--a craft of fourteen tons, costing perhaps £14 per ton, would be ample in point of size, and would save not a little money to the trader. I was at last fortunate in securing the [...] "Eliza," [...] belonging to Messrs. Hatton and Cookson. She was a fore-and-aft schooner of twenty tons, measuring 42 feet 6 inches over all and put up at Bonny Town by Captain Birkett. She had two masts, and oars in case of calms; her crew was of six hands, including one Fernando, a Congoese, who could actually <b>box</b> the <b>compass.</b> No outfit was this time necessary, beyond a letter to Mr. Tippet, who had charge of the highest establishments up stream. His business consisted chiefly of importing arms, ammunition, and beads of different sorts, especially the red porcelain, locally called Loangos.|$|R
