6000|$|Soon after, a round, fat man, with a clergyman's {{gown and}} a barrister's band, called on Curll, {{at ten o'clock}} at night. He said his name was Smith, {{that he was a}} cousin of P.T.'s, and shewed the <b>book</b> <b>in</b> <b>sheets,</b> along with about a dozen of the {{original}} letters. After a good deal of negotiation with this personage, Curll obtained fifty copies of P.T.'s printed copies, and issued a flaming advertisement announcing the publication of Pope's letters for thirty years, and stating that the original MSS. were lying at his shop, and might be seen by any who chose,--although not a single MS. seems to have been delivered. Smith, the day that the advertisement appeared, handed over, for a sum of money, about three hundred volumes to Curll. But as in the advertisement it was stated that various letters of lords were included, and as there is a law amongst regulations of the Upper House that no peer's letters can be published without his consent, at the instance of the Earl of Jersey, and in consequence, too, of an advertisement of Pope's, the books were seized, and Curll, and the printer of the paper where the advertisement appeared, were ordered to appear at the bar for breach of privilege. P.T. wrote Curll to tell him to conceal all that passed between him and the publisher, and promising him more valuable letters still. Curll, however, told the whole story; and as, when the books were examined, not a single lord's letter was found among them, Curll was acquitted, his books restored to him, the lords saying that they had been made the tools of Pope; and he proceeded to advertise the correspondence, in terms most insulting to Pope, who now felt himself compelled (!) to print, by subscription, his genuine letters, which, when printed, turned out, strange to tell, to be identical with those published by the rapacious bookseller! On viewing the whole transaction, we incline with Johnson, Warton, Bowles, Macaulay, and Carruthers, to look upon it as one of Pope's ape-like stratagems--to believe that P.T. was himself, Smith his agent, and that his objects were partly to outwit Curll, to mystify the public, to gratify that strange love of manoeuvring which dwelt as strongly in him as in any match-making mamma, and to attract interest and attention to the genuine correspondence when it should appear. Pope, it was said, could not [...] "drink tea without a stratagem," [...] and far less publish his correspondence without a series of contemptible tricks--tricks, however, in which he was true to his nature--that being a curious compound of the woman and the wit, the monkey and the genius[1].|$|E

60|$|The Molimo led {{her forward}} {{to the foot of}} the crucifix, where, upon its lowest step and upon the {{cemented}} floor immediately beneath it respectively, lay two shapes decorously covered with shawls of some heavy material interwoven with gold wire, for the manufacture of which the Makalanga were famous when first the Portuguese came into contact with them. The Molimo took hold of the cloths that seemed almost as good now as on the day when they were woven, and lifted them, revealing beneath the figures of a man and woman. The features were unrecognizable, although the hair, white in the man's case and raven black in that of the woman, remained perfect. They had been great people, for orders glittered upon the man's breast, and his sword was gold hilted, whilst the woman's bones were adorned with costly necklaces and jewels, and in her hand was still a <b>book</b> bound <b>in</b> <b>sheets</b> of silver.

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>books</b> of <b>sheet</b> music, {{relatively}} short pieces {{of music that}} span two to four pages often need to be arranged so the number of page turns for the performer is minimized. For example, a three-page work (starting on the left-hand sheet) followed immediately by a two-page work involves one page turn during each work. If a blank page immediately followed the three-page work (on the right-hand sheet), the two-page work will span {{the left and right}} pages, alleviating the need for a page turn during the second work. Intentionally blank pages may also prevent a page turn during a difficult passage.|$|R
40|$|Publisher's chapter description: Likewise {{with books}} bound after what manner you please. It is {{as well to}} {{remember}} this statement {{when looking at the}} work of the hundreds of binders active throughout the United Kingdom over the period covered by this volume, who would have laboured for much of the time on individual commissions from retail booksellers (if they did not serve this function themselves), institutional libraries or private individuals, seeking to have <b>books</b> bought <b>in</b> <b>sheets,</b> paper wrappers or other temporary bindings put into permanent ones. For most of the eighteenth century, only the very cheapest end of the trade, such as school-books, popular romances and devotional works, typically sold books bound and delivered direct to the end-user, though the sale of bound bibles and liturgical works was something of an exception to that. It is in the second decade of the nineteenth century that significant numbers of editions were for the first time issued bound in what were intended to be permanent bindings. It is also important to remember that the bindings we know best from the literature – generally the more extensively decorated bindings – formed only a very small part of the trade. This chapter will therefore take as its main focus the more standard types of binding and the more ephemeral protection offered to text blocks within the book trade; the reader is directed to the existing literature for a more detailed accountof the more extensively decorated books...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{investigate}} the Hegde’s instability mechanics for the prediction of forming limit <b>in</b> <b>sheet</b> metal forming. Design/methodology/approach: Hegde’s Instability Mechanics (HIM) paves way for explaining the effects of diffuse instability and localization due to necking <b>in</b> <b>sheet</b> metal forming. For different ranges of stress ratios, the ratio of strain differentials has been computed and hence the forming limits are predicted. Findings: Basing the formulation of HIM on the von Misess yield criterion and applying the interface theory (briefed in appendix) the state-of- the-art purpose is deemed to be well served and demonstrated. Interface theory to explain in simple terms, gives the optimal decision variables in an ‘n’ dimensional hyper-space. The concept of HIM is demonstrated on isotropic and anisotropic materials. The anisotropic materials show better stability than isotropic materials <b>in</b> <b>sheet</b> metal forming. However the geometric instability is analyzed with the assumptions that the thickness stresses are negligible and biaxial state of stress persists <b>in</b> <b>sheet</b> metal forming. Practical implications: The observations {{are based on the}} theoretical findings for which the experimental validation exists in the reviewed references. Originality/value: To the sincere knowledge of authors, is both different and unique of its kind <b>in</b> <b>sheet</b> forming mechanics needing horizontal exploration by potential researchers...|$|R
