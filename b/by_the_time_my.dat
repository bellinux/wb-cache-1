2500|$|Survival was a moral {{as well as}} a {{physical}} struggle. A woman doctor wrote to a friend in June 1933 that she had not yet become a cannibal, but was [...] "not sure that I shall not be one <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>my</b> letter reaches you." [...] The good people died first. Those who refused to steal or to prostitute themselves died. Those who gave food to others died. Those who refused to eat corpses died. Those who refused to kill their fellow man died.... At least 2,505 people were sentenced for cannibalism in the years 1932 and 1933 in Ukraine, though the actual number of cases was certainly much higher.|$|E

60|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>my</b> Lady had returned, from {{explaining}} {{things to}} the music-master, the map had been hung up, and the Baron was already much bewildered by the Vice-Warden's habit of pointing to one place while he shouted out the name of another.|$|E
6000|$|It {{would appear}} that the {{intensity}} of my desire, the power of my resolve to bring her back to life, strengthened her, wrought upon her with inexplicable magic, for <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>my</b> father arrived she was able to speak and to sit once more in her wheeled chair.

60|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>my</b> {{regiment}} {{had reached}} the plateau night had {{put an end to}} the struggle. A sputter of rifles would break out now and then, followed perhaps by a spiritless hurrah. Occasionally a shell from a far-away battery would come pitching down somewhere near, with a whir crescendo, or flit above our heads with a whisper like that made by the wings of a night bird, to smother itself in the river. But there was no more fighting. The gunboats, however, blazed away at set intervals all night long, just to make the enemy uncomfortable and break him of his rest.|$|E
500|$|When a diner ordered {{potato chips}} off-menu, White hand cut them himself and charged the {{surprised}} diner £25 for the portion.

60|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that <b>my</b> {{friend had}} {{concluded}} Schneider's biography, we had grown tolerably intimate, and I imparted to him (with that experience so remarkable in youth) my whole history--my course of studies, my pleasant country life, {{the names and}} qualities of my dear relations, and my occupations in the vestry before religion was abolished <b>by</b> order of <b>the</b> Republic. In {{the course of my}} speech I recurred so often to the name of my cousin Mary, that the gentleman could not fail to perceive what a tender place she had in my heart.|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} four miles the path gently ascended through an open country, then became {{abruptly}} much steeper, and led me deeper and deeper among thickets and endless woods. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>my</b> watch informed me that I must have nearly walked my appointed distance, the view was bounded on all sides {{and the sky was}} shut out overhead by an impervious screen of leaves and branches. I still followed my only guide, the steep path; and in ten minutes, emerging suddenly on a plot of tolerably clear and level ground, I saw the convent before me.|$|E
60|$|I could not, for {{the life}} of me, keep that strange tone out of my voice. Silas Foster, obtuse as were his sensibilities, seemed to feel the ghastly earnestness that was {{conveyed}} in it as well as Hollingsworth did. He immediately withdrew his head, and I heard him yawning, muttering to his wife, and again yawning heavily, while he hurried on his clothes. Meanwhile I showed Hollingsworth a delicate handkerchief, marked with a well-known cipher, and told where I had found it, and other circumstances, which had filled me with a suspicion so terrible that I left him, if he dared, to shape it out for himself. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>my</b> brief explanation was finished, we were joined by Silas Foster in his blue woollen frock.|$|E
60|$|In {{the mean}} time, {{my partner and}} the pilot went express to the port where we first put in, to dispose of what goods had been left there, while I {{accompanied}} a Chinese merchant {{who was going to}} Nanquin, and there bought twenty-nine pieces of damask, with about three hundred more of other fine silks; and, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>my</b> partner returned to Pekin, I had them all carried thither; our cargo in silks amounted to 45col. sterling, which, together with tea, fine calicoes, nutmegs, and cloves, loaded eighteen camels for our share, besides what we rode upon, with two or three spare horses, and two more loaden with provisions; the company now was very great, making about four hundred horse, and above one hundred and twenty men, well armed and provided. We were of several nations, among whom were five Scotch merchants, inhabiting in Moscow, and well experienced in trade.|$|E
25|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> I made <b>my</b> way {{to where}} I {{could see them}} it was still unclear what was going on. The guardsmen {{themselves}} looked stunned. We looked at them and they looked at us. They were just kids, 19 years old, like us. But in uniform. Like our boys in Vietnam.|$|R
6000|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> I dragged <b>my</b> last load in, Nuflo had got {{his fire}} well alight, and was heaping on wood {{in a most}} lavish way.

6000|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> I reached <b>my</b> {{house and}} had filled my pipe and sat myself {{down in the}} {{dilapidated}} cane chair on the veranda, that natural reaction set in which so often follows rejoicing at the escape from a great danger. It was true that no one believed I had cheated them over that thrice-accursed gold mine, but how about other matters? ...|$|R
60|$|The day {{had grown}} older and I wiser <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>my</b> letters were read, with their strange perfume from outre-mer, the horses {{harnessed}} afresh, and we under way once more, clattering {{down the main}} street of the village. It was not only in the village that we made a stir. A basha is equal to the occasion anywhere. The whole countryside stopped in its tracks to turn and stare as we passed, and at one point we came in for a perfect ovation; for our passage and the noonday recess of a school happening to coincide, the children, at that moment let loose, instantly dashed after us pell-mell, in a mass, shouting. One or two of them were so eager in the chase that they minded not where they went, and, tripping over stones or ruts, fell headlong in the mud. The rest pursued us panting, each according to his legs, and gave over at last only for want of wind.|$|E
6000|$|Those three phrases, [...] "Ready about," [...] "Hard a-lee," [...] and [...] "All right," [...] {{comprised}} Tehei's English {{vocabulary and}} led me to suspect that at some time he {{had been one of}} a Kanaka crew under an American captain. Between the puffs I made signs to him and repeatedly and interrogatively uttered the word SAILOR. Then I tried it in atrocious French. MARIN conveyed no meaning to him; nor did MATELOT. Either my French was bad, or else he was not up in it. I have since concluded that both conjectures were correct. Finally, I began naming over the adjacent islands. He nodded that he had been to them. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>my</b> quest reached Tahiti, he caught my drift. His thought-processes were almost visible, and it was a joy to watch him think. He nodded his head vigorously. Yes, he had been to Tahiti, and he added himself names of islands such as Tikihau, Rangiroa, and Fakarava, thus proving that he had sailed as far as the Paumotus--undoubtedly one of the crew of a trading schooner.|$|E
60|$|Slowly, surely, {{steadily}} I climbed, {{putting aside}} all dreams, paying strict attention to business. Often my other self, little Paul of the sad eyes, {{would seek to}} lure me from my work. But for my vehement determination never to rest for a moment till I had purchased back my honesty, my desire--growing day by day, till it became almost a physical hunger--to feel again the pressure of Norah's strong white hand in mine, he might possibly have succeeded. Heaven only knows what then he might have made of me: politician, minor poet, more or less able editor, hampered by convictions--something most surely of but little service to myself. Now and again, with a week to spare--my humour making holiday, {{nothing to be done}} but await patiently its return--I would write stories for my own pleasure. They made no mark; but success in purposeful work is of slower growth. Had I persisted--but there was money to be earned. And <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>my</b> debts were paid, I had established a reputation.|$|E
50|$|Before Kendricks officially {{left the}} Temptations, he and Paul Williams {{recorded}} the lead vocals for Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me), a ballad that became Kendricks' final single with the group. Included on the Sky's the Limit LP {{along with the}} original album version of Smiling Faces Sometimes, Just My Imagination was released as a single in January 1971, and the song began steadily climbing the US pop singles chart, peaking at number 1 two months later. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> Just <b>My</b> Imagination topped the charts, Kendricks had negotiated his release from the group and signed a solo deal with Motown's Tamla label.|$|R
5000|$|Paul {{moved to}} Los Angeles in 2003, {{at the age}} of 34. [...] "I've fallen in love with the city. I found it {{difficult}} at first, but like I said I was doing it in pretty small doses. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> I had <b>my</b> own place I was pretty comfortable here, and now I love it. There's really no place in the world like Los Angeles, love it or hate it."

6000|$|... "You are to know," [...] he said, [...] "reverend father, {{that this}} rustical juvenal having chosen to offer me, in the {{presence}} of your venerable Superior, yourself, and other excellent and worthy persons, besides the damsel, Mary Avenel, whom I term my Discretion in all honour and kindness, a gross insult, rendered yet more intolerable <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and place, <b>my</b> just resentment did so gain the mastery over my discretion, that I resolved to allow him the privileges of an equal, and to indulge him with the combat." ...|$|R
60|$|Leading the way {{immediately}} {{to a place}} beneath the falling stream, {{where there was a}} deep, eddying pool, Mr. Garthwaite baited and threw in his line before I had fixed the joints of my fishing-rod. This first difficulty overcome, I involuntarily plunged into some excellent, but rather embarrassing, sport with my line and hook. I caught every one of my garments, from head to foot; I angled for my own clothes with the dexterity and success of Izaak Walton himself. I caught my hat, my jacket, my waistcoat, my trousers, my fingers, and my thumbs--some devil possessed my hook; some more than eel-like vitality twirled and twisted in every inch of my line. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>my</b> host arrived to assist me, I had attached myself to my fishing-rod, apparently for life. All difficulties yielded, however, to his patience and skill; my hook was baited for me, and thrown in; my rod was put into my hand; my friend went back to his place; and we began at last to angle in earnest.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may perhaps wonder," [...] I went on, [...] "why, if I think this, I, who am, as I told you, a timid man, should {{undertake}} such a journey. It is for two reasons. First I am a fatalist, {{and believe}} that my time is appointed to come quite without reference to my own movements and will, and that if I am to go to Suliman's Mountains to be killed, I shall go there and shall be killed. God Almighty, no doubt, knows His mind about me, so I need not trouble on that point. Secondly, I am a poor man. For nearly forty years I have hunted and traded, but I have never made more than a living. Well, gentlemen, I don't know if you are aware that the average life of an elephant hunter {{from the time he}} takes to the trade is between four and five years. So you see I have lived through about seven generations of my class, and I should think that my time cannot be far off, anyway. Now, if anything were to happen to me in the ordinary course of business, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>my</b> debts are paid there would be nothing left to support my son Harry whilst he was {{getting in the way of}} earning a living, whereas now he will be set up for five years. There is the whole affair in a nutshell." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>my</b> {{friend had}} got safely into the berth, and readjusted his {{handcuffs}} and the rope, it was broad daylight. We {{had made a}} narrow escape indeed; for scarcely had he arranged all matters, when the mate came below, with Dirk Peters and the cook. They talked for some time about the vessel from the Cape Verds, {{and seemed to be}} excessively anxious for her appearance. At length the cook came to the berth in which Augustus was lying, and seated himself in it near the head. I could see and hear every thing from my hiding-place, for the piece cut out had not been put back, and I was in momentary expectation that the negro would fall against the pea-jacket, which was hung up to conceal the aperture, in which case all would have been discovered, and our lives would, no doubt, have been instantly sacrificed. Our good fortune prevailed, however; and although he frequently touched it as the vessel rolled, he never pressed against it sufficiently to bring about a discovery. The bottom of the jacket had been carefully fastened to the bulkhead, so that the hole might not be seen by its swinging to one side. All this time Tiger was lying in the foot of the berth, and appeared to have recovered in some measure his faculties, for I could see him occasionally open his eyes and draw a long breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "One more--received <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lawyers this <b>time.</b> <b>My</b> unknown {{correspondent}} {{has written}} {{to them to}} withdraw his proposal, and to announce that he has left Perth. The lawyers recommended me to stop my uncle from spending money uselessly in employing the London police. I have forwarded their letter to the captain; and he will probably be in town to see his solicitors as soon as I get there with you. So much for what I have done in this matter. Dear Lady Lundie--when we are at our journey's end, {{what do you mean}} to do?" ...|$|R
60|$|And I was {{beginning}} to see too very clearly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of <b>my</b> return that what is confusedly called the labor problem is really not one problem at all, but two. There is the old problem, the problem as old as Zimbabwe and the pyramids, the declining problem, the problem of organizing masses of unskilled labor to the constructive ends of a Great State, {{and there is the}} new modification due to machinery, which has rendered unskilled labor and labor of a low grade of skill almost unnecessary to mankind, added coal, oil, wind and water, the elementary school and the printing-press to our sources of power, and superseded the ancient shepherding and driving of men <b>by</b> <b>the</b> possibility of their intelligent and willing co-operation. The two are still mixed in every discussion, even as they are mixed in the practice of life, but inevitably they will be disentangled.

2500|$|Paul Williams, the Temptations' {{original}} {{lead singer}} and Kendricks' lifelong best friend, who sings {{the first line}} in the bridge ("Every night, on my knees, I pray..."), had suffered for three years from health problems related to alcoholism and sickle-cell disease. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> [...] "Just <b>My</b> Imagination" [...] was cut, Paul Williams' contributions to the Temptations' recordings had been reduced, and the group had Otis Williams' old associate Richard Street lined up as Paul Williams' replacement.

She {{informed}} me that there was nothing more to be said, but she couldn't help saying more, and asked me what I intended doing about it. Nothing, I answered; since she refused to countenance Fan, there was nothing I could do. Not quite satisfied, she asked whether this disagreement between us would make any difference. I said that it would make {{all the difference in the}} world. She was angry at that, but got over it <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>my</b> visit came to an end, and she asked me very sweetly when I was going to see her again. I laughed, and said that after she had turned me, quixotic ideas and all, out of her house, I could not very well return. It distressed her very much; for she knows that I am not all softness, that I can sometimes stick to a resolution. Then at last came the question that should have come first: What was this poor girl of the lower orders about whom I had lost my reason like? ...|$|E
60|$|There is {{only one}} way in which the author can protect himself; and that is by making a version of his own and going through the same legal farce with it. But the legal farce {{involves}} the hire of a hall and the payment of a fee of two guineas to the King's Reader of Plays. When I wrote Cashel Byron's Profession I had no guineas to spare, a common disability of young authors. What is equally common, I did not know the law. A reasonable man may guess a reasonable law, but no man can guess a foolish anomaly. Fortunately, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>my</b> book so suddenly revived in America I was aware of the danger, and in a position to protect myself by writing and performing The Admirable Bashville. The prudence of doing so was soon demonstrated; for rumors soon reached me of several American stage versions; and one of these has actually been played in New York, with the boxing scenes under the management (so it is stated) of the eminent pugilist Mr. James J. Corbett. The New York press, in a somewhat derisive vein, conveyed the impression that in this version Cashel Byron sought to interest the public rather as the last of the noble race of the Byrons of Dorsetshire than as his unromantic self; but in justice to a play which I never read, and an actor whom I never saw, and who honorably offered to treat me as if I had legal rights in the matter, I must not accept the newspaper evidence as conclusive.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is {{a friend}} of mine, an old sea-captain. He is the sort of man that when the three balls are lying in a {{straight}} line, tucked up under the cushion, looks pleased; because then he knows he can make a cannon and leave the red just where he wants it. An Irish youngster named Malooney, a college chum of Dick's, was staying with us; and the afternoon being wet, the Captain said he would explain it to Malooney, how a young man might practise billiards without any danger of cutting the cloth. He taught him how to hold the cue, and he told him how to make a bridge. Malooney was grateful, and worked for about an hour. He did not show much promise. He is a powerfully built young man, and he didn't seem able to get it into his head that he wasn't playing cricket. Whenever he hit a little low the result was generally lost ball. To save time--and damage to furniture--Dick and I fielded for him. Dick stood at long-stop, and I was short slip. It was dangerous work, however, and when Dick had caught him out twice running, we agreed that we had won, and took him in to tea. In the evening--none {{of the rest of us}} being keen to try our luck a second time--the Captain said, that just for the joke of the thing he would give Malooney eighty-five and play him a hundred up. To confess the truth, I find no particular fun myself in playing billiards with the Captain. The game consists, as far as I am concerned, in walking round the table, throwing him back the balls, and saying [...] "Good!" [...] <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>my</b> turn comes I don't seem to care what happens: everything seems against me. He is a kind old gentleman and he means well, but the tone in which he says [...] "Hard lines!" [...] whenever I miss an easy stroke irritates me. I feel I'd like to throw the balls at his head and fling the table out of window. I suppose it is that I am in a fretful state of mind, but the mere way in which he chalks his cue aggravates me. He carries his own chalk in his waistcoat pocket--as if our chalk wasn't good enough for him-- and when he has finished chalking, he smooths the tip round with his finger and thumb and taps the cue against the table.
