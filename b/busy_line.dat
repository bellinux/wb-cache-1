25|$|The Glasgow and South Western Railway (G) had {{main lines}} to Ayr and Carlisle; {{but the first}} section of the Ayr line was over the Glasgow and Paisley joint line: the line was {{operated}} by a Joint Committee, answerable to both the G and its rival, the Caledonian Railway. This lack of sovereignty was difficult enough in the railway politics of the time; but as traffic developed, congestion on the <b>busy</b> <b>line</b> became a serious issue. At that time goods traffic was heavy and slow, and line capacity and reliability were heavily compromised.|$|E
2500|$|For over a decade, the Onerahi Branch {{was a very}} <b>busy</b> <b>line.</b> [...] When it opened, {{the primary}} method of {{transport}} between Auckland and Whangarei for both passengers and freight involved a steamer between Auckland and Onerahi and the train from Onerahi to Whangarei. [...] Trains ran {{to connect with the}} steamers, with both dedicated goods services and [...] "mixed" [...] trains for both passengers and freight operating.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} improvement {{involved a}} fundamental change in the electrical logic of the switching system. The Panel originally shipped in a ground cut-off (GCO) configuration. A <b>busy</b> <b>line</b> condition was indicated by ground potential at the cut-off relay, and thus at the sleeve lead, which would be detected by the selector as it hunted over the terminals. Starting in 1929, all newer panel systems were deployed as battery cut-off (BCO) systems. In this revision, the presence of [...] level on the sleeve lead indicated busy status. This change necessitated {{a fundamental change}} {{in the design of the}} system, and was undertaken for many reasons. One of the most notable was that GCO offices were more prone to fire.|$|E

2500|$|On September 28, 2005, a {{southbound}} Acela Express {{struck a}} car at Miner Lane in Waterford, Connecticut, the first such incident since the additional protections were implemented. The train was approaching the crossing at approximately [...] when the car reportedly rolled under the lowered crossing gate arms {{too late for the}} sensor system to fully stop the train. The driver and one passenger were killed on impact; the other passenger died nine days later from injuries sustained in the crash. The gates were later inspected and declared to have been functioning properly {{at the time of the}} incident. The incident drew public criticism about the remaining grade crossings along the <b>busy</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As in the divided-multiple {{telephone}} switchboard arrangements {{with which it}} served until it replaced them, the panel system consisted of an originating section and a terminating section, connected by a line circuit. A subscriber's line had two appearances in a local office, one on the originating side, {{and one on the}} terminating side. The line circuit consisted of a line relay on the originating side to indicate that a customer had gone off-hook, and a cutoff relay to keep the line relay from interfering with an established connection. [...] The cutoff relay was controlled by a sleeve lead that, as with the multiple switchboard, could be activated by either the incoming section or the outgoing. [...] The final selector performed a sleeve test to detect a <b>busy</b> <b>line</b> when a subscriber was called.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 June 1985, at 13:30 UTC, a man {{calling himself}} [...] "Manjit Singh" [...] (checked in as M. Singh) called to confirm his {{reservations}} on Air India Flight 181/182. He {{was told he}} was still wait-listed, and was offered alternative arrangements, which he declined. At 15:50 UTC (7:50am), M. Singh checked into a <b>busy</b> <b>line</b> of 30 people for the CP flight from Vancouver to Toronto, which was scheduled to leave at 9:18am. He asked agent Jeannie Adams to check his dark brown, hard-sided Samsonite suitcase, and have it transferred to Air India Flight 181 and then to Flight 182 to India. The agent initially refused his request to inter-line the baggage since his seat from Toronto to Montreal and from Montreal to Bombay was unconfirmed. He insisted, but the agent again rebuffed him, telling him, [...] "Your ticket doesn't read that you're confirmed" [...] and [...] "we're not supposed to check your baggage through." [...] The man said, [...] "Wait, I'll get my brother for you." [...] As he started to walk away, she relented and agreed to accept the bag, but {{told him he would}} have to check in again with Air India in Toronto. After the crash, Adams would realise this deception got the bag on its way to Flight 182. The anxious man was never identified. At 16:18 UTC (9:18am), Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 60 to Toronto Pearson International Airport departed without Singh.|$|E

5000|$|The Centronics Model 101 printer, {{featuring}} this connector, {{was released}} in 1970. The host sent ASCII characters to the printer using 7 of 8 data pins, pulling them high to +5V to represent a 1. When the data was ready, the host pulled the STROBE pin low, to 0 V. The printer responded by pulling the <b>BUSY</b> <b>line</b> high, printing the character, and then returning BUSY to low again. The host could then send another character. Control characters in the data caused other actions, like the [...] or [...] The host could also have the printer automatically start a new line by pulling the AUTOFEED line high, and keeping it there. The host had to carefully watch the <b>BUSY</b> <b>line</b> to ensure it did not feed data to the printer too rapidly, especially given variable-time operations like a paper feed.|$|E
5000|$|Operator {{assistance}} {{refers to}} a telephone call in which the calling party requires an operator to provide some form of assistance in completing the call. This may include telephone calls made from pay phones, calls placed station-to-station, person-to-person, collect, third number calls, calls billed to a credit card, and certain international calls which cannot be dialed directly. The telephone operator may {{also be able to}} assist with determining what kind of technical difficulties are occurring on a phone line, to verify whether a line is busy (<b>Busy</b> <b>Line</b> Verification, or BLV), or left off the hook, and break in on a phone line to request for the caller to clear the line for an incoming call (<b>Busy</b> <b>Line</b> Interruption, or BLI). The latter service is often utilized by emergency police. In addition, operators are often a first point of contact for the elderly wanting information on the current date and time.|$|E
