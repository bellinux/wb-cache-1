40|$|The {{security}} of cascade ciphers, in which by definition the keys of the component ciphers are independent, is considered. It {{is shown by}} a counterexample that the intuitive result, formally stated and proved in the literature, that a cascade {{is at least as}} strong as the strongest component cipher, requires the uninterestingly restrictive assumption that the enemy cannot exploit information about the plaintext statistics. It is proved, for very general notions of <b>breaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>cipher</b> and of problem difficulty, that a cascade is at least as difficult to break as the first component cipher. A consequence of this result is that, if the ciphers commute, then a cascade is at least as difficult to break as the most-difficult-tobreak component cipher, i. e., the intuition that a cryptographic chain is at least as strong as its strongest link is then provably correct. It is noted that additive stream ciphers do commute, and this fact is used to suggest a strategy for designing secure practical ci [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide a novel {{approach}} for breaking a significant class of block ciphers, the so-called SPN ciphers, using the process of gene assembly in ciliates. Our proposed scheme utilizes, for the first time, the Turing-powerful potential of gene assembly procedure of ciliated protozoa {{into the real world}} computations and has a fewer number of steps than the other proposed schemes to break a cipher. We elaborate notions of formal language theory based on AIR systems, which {{can be thought of as}} a modified version of intramolecular scheme to model the ciliate bio-operations, for construction of building blocks necessary for breaking the cipher, and based on these nature-inspired constructions which are as powerful as Turing machines, we propose a theoretical approach for breaking SPN ciphers. Then, we simulate our proposed plan for breaking these ciphers on a sample block cipher based on this structure. Our results show that the proposed scheme has 51. 5 percent improvement over the best previously proposed nature-inspired scheme for <b>breaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>cipher...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} disguising {{information}} so that ideally it cannot {{be understood by}} anyone but the intended recipient is called a cipher. Cryptanalysis refers {{to the process of}} an unintended recipient of disguised information attempting to remove the disguise and understand the information, and successful cryptanalysis is called <b>breaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>cipher.</b> When a cipher is used to exchange information, the undisguised information is called the plaintext, and the disguised information the ciphertext. The process of converting from plaintext to ciphertext is called encryption. Upon receiving a ciphertext, the recipient must remove the disguise, a process called decryption. To be able to effectively encrypt and decrypt messages, correspondents must typically share knowledge of a secret key, which is used in applying the cipher. More specifically, the key for a cipher is information usually known only to the originator and intended recipient of a message, which is used by the originator to encrypt the plaintext, and the recipient to decrypt the ciphertext.

Although the basic characteristics of this cipher are similar to those of AES, FOX uses a non-invertible key schedule which makes it necessary to use a different attack plan.

Statistical models {{are used in}} conventional automatic speech transcription systems to produce the most likely transcription. For optimal performance, large task representative databases are required for data driven parameter estimationof statistical speech transcription models. The manual creation of high quality labeled speech data for statistical model training {{is by far the}} most time consuming processand also one of the largest cost factors to be considered. In this thesis, we investigate unsupervised parameter training and refinement methods for acoustic models to reduce time and cost factors in the development of automatic speech transcription systems. First, we describe the costly creation process of manually labeled training data to setup a transcription system from scratch. In contrast, we present a cost-efficient rapidporting of an existing transcription system for a new domain or language, when the setup of a transcription system is constrained by a budget or time limit. We summarize a framework to efficiently enrich automatically generated transcription hypotheses with posterior confidence scores for different transcription details, e. g. word, pronunciation, or state confidence scores. We evaluate confidence based weightingand filtering approaches for various unsupervised acoustic model adaptation techniques. Posterior confidence scores on state level are studied for unsupervised adaptation as well as for unsupervised training of acoustic model parameters. We examine different unsupervised training scenarios where the amount and thequality of available language resources vary. We improve the accuracy of a well tuned English transcription system for European parliament speeches – trained on one hundredhours of carefully manually transcribed speech data – by applying additional automatically labeled audio recordings. In contrast to this scenario, we then bootstrap the acoustic model of a Polish transcription system from a Spanish model and iteratively refine the Polish model by exclusively using automatically labeled training data. In addition, we address the scenario of improving a Persian pronunciation lexicon by unsupervised refinement of a statistical pronunciation model. Finally, we discuss the task of developing an acoustic model for a transcription system without any manually labeled training or evaluation data analogously to the task of <b>breaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>cipher</b> system...|$|E

If a cryptanalyst has access to, for example, {{the amount of time}} the device took to encrypt a number of plaintexts or report an error in a password or PIN character, he may be able to use a timing attack to <b>break</b> <b>a</b> <b>cipher</b> that is otherwise resistant to analysis. An attacker might also study the pattern and length of messages to derive valuable information; this is known as traffic analysis and can be quite useful to an alert adversary. Poor administration of a cryptosystem, such as permitting too short keys, will make any system vulnerable, regardless of other virtues.

There are several algebraic methods of attack {{that can be used to}} <b>break</b> <b>a</b> specific <b>cipher,</b> such as Buchburger's and Faugere's F 4 and F 5 methods. The method to be used and evaluated in this thesis is the Multiple Right Hand Sides (MRHS) Linear Equations. MRHS is a new method that allows computations to be more efficient and the equations to be more compact in comparison with the previously referred methods. Because of the high complexity of the Rijndael algorithm, the purpose of this thesis is to investigate the results of an MRHS attack in a small-scale variant of the AES, since it is impossible to break the actual algorithm by using only the existent knowledge. Instead of the original ten rounds of AES algorithm, variants of up to four rounds were used. Simple examples of deciphering some ciphertexts are presented for different variants of the AES, and the new attack method of MRHS linear equations is compared with the other older methods.
