40|$|Since Romania {{joined the}} European Union (EU) in 2007, other EU member {{countries}} {{have started to}} experience an influx of migrants from Romania, specifically the Roma community. The Roma population has been a discriminated group for centuries. In Romania, their social exclusion has been related {{to a wide range}} of factors such as ethnic origin, poor living conditions, or the limited access to education and employment. These factors are not mutually exclusive and they usually come together. This paper is aimed to describe the migration phenomenon of Romanian Romani people in Stockholm, Sweden through the eyes of the migrants themselves. The main goal is to get first-hand knowledge about the Roma community and truly understand the characteristics of their mobility process. The study is primarily based on qualitative research, which gives a clearer insight of the Romani migration.

[...] While at Harvard, he {{played a key role}} in the newly emerging field of Latin American history by training a whole generation of Latin American historians, including Lewis Hanke, Howard F. Cline, Arthur P. Whitaker, and Miron Burgin. Haring published on a variety of topics during his long career, though he was best known for his two major institutional studies. A point of pride was his post as Master of Dunster House, which had a tradition of [...] "individualism and of a strong interest in historical studies." [...] While at Harvard, he served as chairman of the Committee on Latin America for the American Council of Learned Societies from 1932 to 1942 and worked on a joint committee on Latin America of the Social Science Research Council. In 1935, he organized the Bureau of Economic Research at Harvard and, in the same year, served as a delegate to the Second General Assembly of the Pan American Institute for Geography and History. An enduring legacy was his involvement in the Handbook of Latin American Studies (HLAS), a major bibliographic tool for scholars, published annually with the aid of staff in the Hispanic Foundation (later Hispanic Division) at the Library of Congress, begun when Haring's former graduate student Lewis Hanke was director. Such a tool was particularly important in the pre-digital age before the development of electronic library catalogs, with area contributing editors selecting publications for inclusion, along with short summaries. In 1936, Haring wrote an essay for the preface of the first volume of the HLAS, emphasizing that the bibliographic listings were the core of the project, but that [...] "important <b>bibliographical</b> <b>review</b> articles will be included, summarizing recent progress on significant topics or pointing out where further research may be profitable be made." ...|$|E

But no study can be cited with regard to the relationship between lipotropic medication and cholinesterase as one of liver function tests, in cases of experimental liver damage. Now when the physiological significance of serum cholinesterase itself is yet to be fully clarified, the mechanism of the effect of methionine towards the enzyme cannot be discussed hastily. However, as it is observed that serum cholinesterase activity diminishes when liver is injured clinically or experimentally, and also as it is guessed that the habitat of serum cholinesterase may be in the liver, 100 - 102) it is an interesting problem to inquire how the protective effect of methionine against the liver damage, direct or indirect, influences on the enzyme. Furthermore, related to the problem of so-called dynamic equilibrium of organic or plasmaproteins, it seems to be so interesting to inquire into the transitions of plasma protein fractions, liver-cell nucleoproteins, polarographical serum protein waves, etc., together with the trends in serum cholinesterase and serum alkaline phosphatase, through the course of experimental hepatic injury due to CHCl 3 injections, after methionine-medications...|$|R

Richard Bruce Faith is a living American composer who served a tenured position at The University of Arizona from 1961 - 1988, in the School of Music. The merit of Faith's music has been established through discussion of his compositions in professional music journals, <b>bibliographical</b> <b>reviews,</b> newspaper reviews, and graduate research documents. Many of his songs, piano works and orchestral compositions have been published. His operas have been and are continuing to be performed. Publication of Faith's compositions has historically been achieved after continuing discussion in professional journals and after regular performances have created a demand for his product. The choral works of Richard Faith are not published at this time. The choral compositions are an interesting and varied group. Their quality is consistent within the composer's compositional whole. Seventeen of the eighteen choral works were commissioned by or composed with a specific performing choir in mind. The suitability of these compositions for distinct types of choral forces is an obvious result of Faith's pre-defined compositional strictures. For instance, the four anthems for church choir are less demanding than the Three Songs for Male Chorus, which were written for a semi-professional community chorus. The compositional tools which define Faith's unique style also characterize the musical requirements necessary for a successful performance of the individual works. This measure of requisite musicianship is clear in the choral works. In fact, their origin as commissioned works and the intention of specific musicians to perform the works, determined how Faith would use his compositional tools. The search for new music suited to the abilities of singers and accompanists is an ongoing challenge for many choral conductors. Publication of Richard Faith's choral works would answer the need for new music among the great diversity of choirs. Publication of this interesting compositional body would also acknowledge a fine American composer...|$|R
