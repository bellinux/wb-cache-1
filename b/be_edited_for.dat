25|$|In 1972, Stephen Bernard Dorsey, Founder and President of Canadian company Automatic Electronic Systems (AES), {{introduced}} the world’s first programmable word processor {{with a video}} screen. The real breakthrough by Dorsey’s AES team was that their machine stored the operator’s texts on magnetic disks. Texts could be retrieved from the disks simply by entering their names at the keyboard. More importantly, a text could <b>be</b> <b>edited,</b> <b>for</b> instance a paragraph {{moved to a new}} place, or a spelling error corrected, and these changes were recorded on the magnetic disk.|$|E
500|$|In {{the scene}} where Joffrey forces Sansa to view the heads of Ned and his entourage on spikes, one of the {{prosthetic}} heads briefly seen in profile is that of former U.S. president George W. Bush. In their commentary on the DVD release of season 1, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss explained {{that this was not}} meant as a political statement, but rather because the production used the prosthetic heads that happened to be at hand. Following media reports in June 2012, HBO apologized for this shot, which their statement described as [...] "unacceptable, disrespectful and in very bad taste." [...] The statement also said that the shot would <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> any future home video production and TV broadcasts. HBO removed the episode from digital download services until the scene was edited. In the edited scene, the head bears no resemblance to Bush.|$|E

500|$|Just before 4Kids Entertainment {{revealed}} {{that they were}} planning on producing an English adaptation dub of the anime in the United States, the episode [...] "Dennō Senshi Porygon" [...] caused controversy when it aired in Japan on December 16, 1997. In the episode, there was a scene with a huge explosion that flashed red and blue lights. At this point, viewers started to complain of blurred vision, headaches, dizziness, seizures, blindness, and lost consciousness. A total of 685 viewers were taken to hospitals by ambulances. Alfred R. Kahn, chief executive of 4Kids Entertainment, announced on January 1, 1998, that the anime would <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> the American market. Many American parents worried {{about the safety of}} their children now that the anime would air in the United States, but Kahn said: [...] "We're confident it won't be a problem. [...] We've taken the problem seriously and fixed it." ...|$|E

He {{tried to}} {{encourage}} CBS {{to do other}} shows in color at the facility, but CBS mostly avoided color broadcasting after the network's television set manufacturing division was discontinued in 1951. By 1959, Skelton was the only comedian with a weekly variety television show; others who remained on the air, such as Danny Thomas, were performing their routines as part of situation comedy programs. He performed a preview show for a studio audience on Mondays, using their reactions to determine which skits needed to <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> the Tuesday program. [...] For the Tuesday afternoon run-through prior to the actual show, he ignored the script for the most part, ad-libbing through it at will. The run-through was well attended by CBS Television City employees Sometimes during sketches, both live telecasts and taped programs, Skelton would break up or cause his guest stars to laugh.|$|E
500|$|The authors {{identify}} {{two levels}} of operations when dealing with manuscripts: the assembly and preparation of the materials, {{and the establishment of}} aspects such as chronology and authorship. At the first level one must locate and identify materials to study, be they written, printed, or oral; such a task may be difficult and depend on factors outside literature in its completion. Written and printed works must then <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> readability; this task, which requires [...] "lucky guesswork", entails deciphering illegible parts in the material, classifying it, and identifying possible changes made by scribes (and thus bringing the material closer to its [...] "author's own"). Meanwhile, the second level may require greater initiative from the one studying a work; it involves, among other things, selection of what should be published, how it is best arranged in a collection, the establishment of chronology and authorship through internal and external evidence, and the provision of proper annotation and commentary.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2011, the BBC {{began to}} reshow Top of the Pops on Thursday nights on BBC Four {{beginning}} with the equivalent show from 35 years earlier in a 7:30pm–8:00pm slot approximating to the time the programme was traditionally shown. The first programme shown, 1 April 1976, was chosen because it was from approximately this episode onwards that most editions remain in the BBC archive. The repeat programmes come in two versions; the first is edited down to fit in the 30 minute 7:30 slot, the second is shown normally twice overnight in the following weekend, and is usually complete. However both the short and longer editions can <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> a number of reasons. Potentially offensive content to modern audiences is cut (for example the Barron Knights' in-studio performance of [...] "Food For Thought" [...] on the 13 December 1979 edition including a segment parodying Chinese takeaways using mannerisms that may now be viewed as offensive), and cinematic film footage can be truncated, replaced or removed entirely due to the costs to the BBC of reshowing such footage. The BBC also makes the repeats available on BBC iPlayer. The repeats are continuing as of July 2017 with episodes from 1984.|$|E
2500|$|The game used {{an audio}} soundscape that shared {{similarities}} {{to those of}} the film series, and also included clips taken from the preceding trilogy. It used the same first-person shooter game engine used in many of LucasArts's contemporary titles. The game was built from the same engine as LucasArts' , although the software had to <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> various reasons, the main one being that while Jedi Knights had used an elastic form of physics, DroidWorks had to be true to the real world. While the Star Wars universe was known for its wars and violence, the design team made it a philosophy to use as little violence as possible; this led to create ways to prevent the player from accessing certain levels until a particular point. For instance rather than putting enemies in their way which could only be defeated once the player's droids had enough strength to defeat them, the landscape itself would be designed so only certain types of droids could traverse to the puzzle, which had the bonus effect of weeding out players who had not yet acquired the required parts to successfully complete the level. While the developers planned a [...] "luxurious" [...] development schedule which culminated in the game's release in Christmas 1998, the marketing department thought the game should be released for Labour Day instead; this new focus meant that various cuts had to be made to the design. Ultimately the game passed the Labour Day deadline and was released in October. One of the cut features would have allowed players to place droid parts in locations other than where they were intended to fit, for instance an arm could be attached to a droid's head.|$|E

60|$|That night, wearied as I {{was after}} the {{wonderful}} happenings of the day, I sat late with McArdle, the news editor, explaining to him the whole situation, which he thought important enough to bring next morning before the notice of Sir George Beaumont, the chief. It was agreed that I should write home full accounts of my adventures {{in the shape of}} successive letters to McArdle, and that these should either <b>be</b> <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> the Gazette as they arrived, or held back to be published later, according to the wishes of Professor Challenger, since we could not yet know what conditions he might attach to those directions which should guide us to the unknown land. In response to a telephone inquiry, we received nothing more definite than a fulmination against the Press, ending up with the remark that if we would notify our boat he would hand us any directions which he might think it proper to give us at the moment of starting. A second question from us failed to elicit any answer at all, save a plaintive bleat from his wife to the effect that her husband was in a very violent temper already, and that she hoped we would do nothing to make it worse. A third attempt, later in the day, provoked a terrific crash, and a subsequent message from the Central Exchange that Professor Challenger's receiver had been shattered. After that we abandoned all attempt at communication.|$|E
