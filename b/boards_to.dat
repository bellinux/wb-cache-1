5|$|A {{number of}} private Acts {{establishing}} religious organizations expressly confine membership of their governing <b>boards</b> <b>to</b> persons professing the respective religions.

Similarly, one may only be a member of the Central Sikh Gurdwara Board, which manages gurdwaras (Sikh temples) in Singapore, if one professes the Sikh faith.|$|E
5|$|The 1966 National Historic Preservation Act, {{which created}} the National Register of Historic Places, {{empowered}} individual states to create review <b>boards</b> <b>to</b> function {{with the state}} historical preservation officer.

5|$|Each 22-minute episode takes {{approximately}} {{a year to}} complete; three to four episodes are produced simultaneously. Storyboard artists depict scenes using SketchBook Pro. Adapting these <b>boards</b> <b>to</b> limited animation, studio DHX Media handles the designs, poses and key frames of movement for each character appearing in a given scene for an episode, as well as background art. DHX hands these assets to a separate studio, where the remaining animation is finished using Adobe Flash. The speed of production is throttled slightly by Blythe having two unique outfits per episode, according to director Joel Dickie. Supervising director Dallas Parker similarly explained that the variety of assets created for each episode challenged the process of Flash animation in reusing movements.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} over, Srinivasa Sastri {{successfully}} pressurized the South African government to withdraw Section 5 of the Immigration and Indian Relief (Further Provision) Bill which empowered South African immigration officers and <b>boards</b> <b>to</b> cancel registration certificates. Through his efforts, the Natal Commission for Indian Education was appointed on 17 November 1927. With Sastri's support and encouragement, dissidents of the Transvaal British Indian Association (TBIA) founded the Transvaal Indian Congress (TIC) on 18 December 1927. The TBIA later {{merged with the}} South African Indian Congress. Section 104 of the Liquor Bill prohibiting Indians from entering licensed premises was withdrawn. The Thornton Committee was established in 1928 to investigate the sanitary conditions of Indians in and around Durban.|$|E
5|$|Temple Owls {{finished}} {{the season with}} a 26–8 record. Among the highlights of the year was an upset of #10 Georgetown on December 9, in coach Fran Dunphy's 400th victory. In addition, Lavoy Allen became Temple Owls' all-time leading rebounder in a 66–52 rout of Saint Joseph's. Allen snatched 12 <b>boards</b> <b>to</b> pass Temple Owls' radio analyst Johnny Baum's 1,042 career rebounds. The Owls' 14–2 mark in Atlantic 10 play earned them a two seed in the 2011 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament, where they lost in the semifinals to Richmond.|$|E

5|$|After the Cournoyer goal, {{the goal}} judge refused {{to put the}} goal light on {{despite the fact that}} it was signalled a goal on the ice. In response, Alan Eagleson (seated across the ice from the Team Canada bench) {{attempted}} to reach the timer's bench to protest, causing a ruckus in the crowd as he made his way to the timer's bench. As he was being subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped over the <b>boards</b> <b>to</b> confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him across the ice to the bench. In anger, he shoved his fist to the Soviet crowd, as a few other Canadian supporters also gave the finger to the Soviets. The Soviets continued to play defensively. Sinden speculates the Soviets were willing to accept the tie and win the series on goal differential.|$|E
5|$|Airport {{security}} was introduced on 1 January 2005. This put a large {{strain on the}} terminal capacity and the terminal had to be expanded. Makeshift solutions were used, such as plywood <b>boards</b> <b>to</b> allocate people through the security check. In late 2004, the airport started planning an all-new terminal building, as the old terminal was deemed both too small and out of date. Construction of the NOK-115-million terminal started on 24 October 2006. As the first airport in the world, Brønnøysund received SCAT-I, a satellite-based landing system, on 29 October 2007. The new terminal opened on 26 May 2008, which allowed the a restaurant to open at the airport, all vehicles to be stored indoors and included a new helicopter terminal. Thon Hotel Torghatten opened in October 2009 and an airport surveillance radar was installed in 2010, making Brønnøysund the first regional airport in Norway to have one.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 2013 budget the Dunderdale {{government}} announced that the province's four English school boards would be consolidated into one, while the one French school board would remain as is. The number of school boards in the province had been reduced in 2004, from 10 <b>boards</b> <b>to</b> five. Since that time student enrolment in Newfoundland and Labrador had declined by 14,000, or 17 per cent. The government faced criticism for the amalgamation from people in the education system but despite this Minister Clyde Jackman announced {{the appointment of a}} transition team for the amalgamation on April 24, 2013, with a plan to have the new school board in place for September of that year. The budget also saw reductions in the Department of Education that would affect areas such as administration, learning resources support and district-based numeracy supports. However, the minister said there would be no reduction in the allocation of regular classroom teachers, and Jackman stated that Newfoundland and Labrador had the best student-teacher ratio in the country.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the game}} against Richmond, Temple Owls {{announced}} that starting center Micheal Eric was unavailable {{for the season}} with a right patella injury. Lavoy Allen returned and Temple Owls ended the Spiders' eight game road winning streak, scoring 73–53. Ramone Moore scored 24 points. Juan Fernandez registered 20 points off of 9–10 shooting. Temple Owls controlled the game with a 16–0 run in the second half and shot 56 percent on the game. Lavoy Allen became Temple Owls' all-time leading rebounder in a 66–52 rout of Saint Joseph's. Allen snatched 12 <b>boards</b> <b>to</b> surpass Temple Owls radio analyst Johnny Baum's career 1,042 rebounds. Ramone Moore's 17 points led the team, and Allen scored 14 points to go along with his milestone rebounds. Temple Owls' forward Scootie Randall was unavailable, having a foot injury. The Owls traveled to Cameron Indoor Stadium to play against top-ranked Duke in a nonconference game. Temple Owls lost to the Blue Devils 78–61, as Kyle Singler led Duke with 28 points. Lavoy Allen scored 17 points and had 13 rebounds for Temple Owls, but Duke increased their lead against the Owls with a second half run.|$|E

A brutal gunfight ensues which culminates with Doug attempting to negotiate with Oerstadt but finally catching him off guard and killing him. He gets into the car to try to free Claire but police surround the vehicle and threaten to open fire. To save everyone, Doug and Claire purposely drive the bomb SUV {{off the end of}} the ferry before it explodes.

5|$|Alesi, {{the first}} front-runner {{to make a}} {{scheduled}} pit stop on lap 18, rejoined in tenth. During the next two laps Salo passed Irvine for twelfth, whilst Barrichello made a pit stop from sixth position and came out in eleventh. By lap 22, Michael Schumacher had increased his lead over Häkkinen to eleven seconds. Ralf Schumacher, ten seconds behind Häkkinen, maintained a six-second gap over teammate Button. Michael Schumacher made a pit stop on that lap, emerging in third position. On lap 23 Barrichello passed Herbert for ninth position, and {{during the next two}} laps Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher made pit stops. Button made a pit stop from fourth position on lap 26, and Häkkinen one lap later; Häkkinen was told by his team (on pit <b>boards)</b> <b>to</b> speed up to reduce the gap to Michael Schumacher, who had a heavier fuel load. Button dropped to eighth position, and Häkkinen came out behind Michael Schumacher. Frentzen and Coulthard made their pit stops together on lap 28, with Coulthard emerging ahead of Frentzen. On that lap, Barrichello passed Alesi for sixth position. Barrichello, setting the fastest lap of the race (1:53.803 on lap 30), had consecutive fastest laps before making his second pit stop on lap 31. However, his car's fuel pressure dropped and he was pushed by marshals into the pit lane. Barrichello and Alesi (who had a similar problem) retired, and Button inherited fourth place. Salo was the final scheduled driver to make a pit stop, on lap 33.|$|E

5|$|During {{most of the}} 19th century, {{schooling}} in England {{was provided}} either on a fee-paying basis or by the Church. To ensure that all children had access to elementary education, the Forster Act 1870 set up Local School <b>Boards</b> <b>to</b> provide elementary schools for all children aged 5 to 10. From 1880, schooling became compulsory for that age group. The Education Act 1902 consolidated these boards into local education authorities and allowed them to subsidise schools with money raised from local rate-payers. Alongside a grammar school for boys, a private school for girls and a mixed National School, Sleaford had four elementary schools in 1905: two Wesleyan (one was for infants), one Catholic and one other infants school. The construction of the Bass maltings (1901–06) and the Rauceby Asylum (1897–1902) led {{to an increase in}} the town's population and school inspectors found that the four schools could not accommodate every child in the town. The indebted Wesleyan schools could not afford any enlargements so the town's elementary school managers opted for Kesteven County Council to take responsibility under the 1902 Act. The Council built a schoolhouse on Church Lane at the cost of £11,500, which opened as Sleaford Council School on 4 May 1908. The staff and pupils at the Wesleyan schools were transferred there; its first headmaster was H. H. Godfrey, who had been master at the Wesleyan school. Built with a capacity of 600 pupils, 280 were on roll when teaching commenced.|$|E
