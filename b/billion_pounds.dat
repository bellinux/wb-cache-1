40|$|This paper surveys four ex-post {{quantitative}} {{studies of}} the effect of United Kingdom accession to the European Economic Countries on trade in manufactures. It starts by discussing the principal predictions of economic theory, establishing a framework for measuring integration effects, and sketching the approaches used to study integration effects within the EEC. It then examines the four United Kingdom studies, showing the wide range of approaches and results. It concludes that British imports had risen on account of integration by around 8 <b>billion</b> <b>pound</b> sterling by 1979, almost all of which was trade creation. British exports of manufactures rose by 3 <b>billion</b> <b>pound</b> sterling, a 4. 5 <b>billion</b> <b>pound</b> sterling increase to the EEC being offset by a loss of 1. 5 <b>billion</b> <b>pound</b> sterling elsewhere. The paper concludes by considering estimates of the welfare effects of accession. The changes in the consumption and production of manufactures were probably beneficial overall, but it must be admitted that, to date, economists have not applied best practice techniques to this question.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the economic burden {{of cardiovascular disease}} (CVD) in the United Kingdom, including health and non-healthcare costs, {{and the proportion of}} total CVD cost due to coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prevalence-based approach to assess CVD-related costs from a societal perspective. PATIENTS: All UK residents in 2004 with CVD (International classification of diseases, 10 th revision (ICD- 10) codes I 00 -I 99) and subgroups with CHD (ICD- 10 codes I 20 -I 25) or cerebrovascular disease (ICD- 10 codes I 60 -I 69). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Healthcare costs were estimated from expenditure on community health and social services, accident and emergency care, hospital care, rehabilitation and drugs. Non-healthcare costs were estimated from data on informal care and from productivity losses arising from morbidity and premature death. RESULTS: CVD cost the UK economy 29. 1 <b>billion</b> <b>pound</b> in 2004, with CHD and cerebrovascular disease accounting for 29 % (8. 5 <b>billion</b> <b>pound)</b> and 27 % (8. 0 <b>billion</b> <b>pound)</b> of the total, respectively. The major cost component of CVD was health care, which accounted for 60 % of the cost, followed by productivity losses due to mortality and morbidity, accounting for 23 %, with the remaining 17 % due to informal care-related costs. CONCLUSIONS: CVD is a leading public health problem in the UK measured by the economic burden of disease. This study identified the size and main components of that burden, and will help to inform decisions about research priorities and to monitor the impact of policy initiatives...|$|R
