2500|$|In modern Norwegian, the {{apostrophe}} marks that a {{word has}} been contracted, such as [...] "ha’kke" [...] from [...] "har ikke" [...] (have/has not). Unlike English and French, such elisions are not accepted {{as part of}} standard orthography but are {{used to create a}} more [...] "oral style" [...] in writing. The apostrophe is also used to mark the genitive for words that end in an -s sound: words ending in -s, -x, and -z, some speakers also including words ending in the sound [...] As Norwegian doesn't form the plural with -s, {{there is no need to}} distinguish between an -s forming the possessive and the -s forming the plural. Therefore, we have [...] "mann" [...] (man) and [...] "manns" [...] (man’s), without apostrophe, but [...] "los" [...] (naval pilot) and [...] "los’" [...] (naval pilot’s). Indicating the possessive for former American Presidents George Bush, whose names end in , could be written as both <b>Bushs</b> (simply adding an -s to the name) and Bush’ (adding an apostrophe to the end of the name).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Bushs</b> music, {{at least}} from the mid-1930s, often carried {{political}} overtones.

[...] However, Vaughan Williams thought that, despite <b>Bushs</b> oft-declared theories of the purposes of art and music, [...] "when the inspiration comes over him he forgets all about this and remembers only the one eternal rule for all artists, To thine own self be true." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bushs</b> {{years in}} Berlin brought into his music the {{advanced}} Central European idioms that characterise his major orchestral compositions of the period: the Piano Concerto (1935-37), and the First Symphony (1939-40). Nancy Bush describes the Piano Concerto as <b>Bushs</b> {{first attempt to}} fuse his musical and political ideas. The symphony was even more overtly political, representing in its three movements greed (of the bourgeoisie), frustration (of the proletariat) and the final liberation of the latter, [...] but not, according to Christiansen, [...] "in an idiom calculated {{to appeal to the}} masses".|$|E

5000|$|Aside {{from these}} {{large-scale}} works, much of <b>Bushs</b> compositional {{activity in the}} 1930s was devoted to pageants, songs and choruses written for his choirs, work undertaken with the utmost seriousness. In his introduction to a 1938 socialist song book, Bush wrote that [...] "socialists must sing what we mean and sing it like we mean it". [...] Under <b>Bushs</b> influence the [...] "music of the workers" [...] moved from the high aesthetic represented by, for example, Arthur Bourchiers mid-1920s pamphlet Art and Culture in Relation to Socialism, towards an expression with broader popular appeal.|$|E
