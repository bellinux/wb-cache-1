25|$|BSAT-1a was a {{geostationary}} {{communications satellite}} designed and manufactured by Hughes (now Boeing) on the HS-376 platform. It was originally ordered {{and operated by}} the <b>Broadcasting</b> <b>Satellite</b> System Corporation (B-SAT). It {{was used as the}} main satellite to broadcast television channels for NHK and WOWOW over Japan. It had a pure Ku band payload and operated on the 110°E longitude until it was replaced, along its backup BSAT-1b, by BSAT-3a. On 3 August 2010, it was decommissioned and placed on a graveyard orbit.|$|E

40|$|<b>Broadcasting</b> <b>satellites</b> are {{allocated}} as {{a primary}} service in the band 11. 7 - 12. 2 GHz (11. 7 - 12. 5 GHz in Europe, Africa, and the USSR), but the band is also allocated on a primary basis (equal sharing) to other services - fixed, mobile, <b>broadcasting,</b> and fixed <b>satellite.</b> Presented with these difficult sharing situations, delegates from over 100 countries met at an ITU World Administrative Radio Conference in 1977 {{to develop a plan}} for <b>broadcasting</b> <b>satellites.</b> Many nations wanted a plan that would assign to them now, reserved orbital locations and channel asignments for their future use. Other countries wanted a plan adopted now for future <b>broadcasting</b> <b>satellites</b> which assigned specific channels to specific areas on the ground so that they could use the remaining frequencies to provide terrestrial service right away. This paper describes the 'Plan' developed at the conference and points out how the principles of spectrum management were employed. It also discusses the implications for future international management of the spectrum growing out of this meeting...|$|R

After that, the first Japanese experimental <b>broadcasting</b> <b>satellite,</b> called BSE or Yuri, was launched in 1978. NHK started experimental broadcasting of TV program using BS-2a satellite on May, 1984. The satellite BS-2a was launched {{in preparation for the}} start of full scale 2-channel broadcasts. <b>Broadcasting</b> <b>Satellite</b> BS-2a was the first national DBS (direct <b>broadcasting</b> <b>satellite),</b> transmitting signals directly into the home of TV viewers. Attitude control of the satellite was conducted using the 3 axial method (zero momentum), and design life was 5 years. The TV transponder units are designed to sufficiently amplify transmitted signals to enable reception by small, 40 or 60 cm home-use parabolic antennas. The satellite was equipped with 3 TV transponders (including reserve units). However, one transponder malfunctioned 2 months after launch (March 23, 1984) and a second transponder malfunctioned 3 months after launch (May 3, 1984). So, the scheduled satellite broadcasting had to be hastily adjusted to test broadcasting on a single channel.Later, NHK started regular service (NTSC) and experimental HDTV broadcasting using BS-2b on June, 1989. Some Japanese producers of home electronic consumer devices began to deliver TVsets, VCRs and even home acoustic systems equipped by built-in satellite tuners or receivers. Such electronic goods had a specific BS logo. On April, 1991, Japanese company JSB started pay TV service while BS-3 communication satellite was in use. In 1996 total number of households that receive satellite broadcasting exceeded 10 million. The modern two satellite systems in use in Japan are BSAT and JCSAT; the modern WOWOW <b>Broadcasting</b> <b>Satellite</b> digital service uses BSAT satellites, while other system of digital TV broadcasting SKY PerfecTV! uses JCSAT satellites.|$|E
