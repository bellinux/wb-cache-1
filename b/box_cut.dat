60|$|The path ran, {{for a short}} way, {{through the}} shrubbery, which evidently was a belt {{encircling}} the grounds. From this the Prince and Vivian emerged upon a lawn, which formed on the farthest side a terrace, by gradually sloping down to {{the margin of the}} river. It was enclosed on the other side, and white pheasants were feeding in its centre. Following the path which skirted the lawn, they arrived at a second gate, which opened into a garden, in which no signs of the taste at present existing in Germany for the English system of picturesque pleasure-grounds were at all visible. The walk was bounded on both sides by tall borders, or rather hedges, of <b>box,</b> <b>cut</b> into the shape of battlements; the sameness of these turrets being occasionally varied by the immovable form of some trusty warder, carved out of yew or laurel. Raised terraces and arched walks, aloes and orange trees mounted on sculptured pedestals, columns of cypress and pyramids of bay, whose dark foliage strikingly contrasted with the marble statues, and the white vases shining in the sun, rose in all directions in methodical confusion. The sound of a fountain was not wanting, and large beds of beautiful flowers abounded. Proceeding through a lofty berçeau, occasional openings in whose curving walks allowed effective glimpses of a bust or a statue, the companions at length came in sight of the house. It was a long, uneven, low building, evidently of ancient architecture. Numerous stacks of tall and fantastically-shaped chimneys rose over three thick and heavy gables, which reached down farther than the middle of the elevation, forming three compartments, one of them including a large and modern bow window, over which clustered hi profusion the sweet and glowing blossoms of the clematis and the pomegranate. Indeed, the whole front of the house was so completely covered with a rich scarlet-creeper, that it was difficult to ascertain of what materials it was built. As Vivian was admiring a white peacock, which, attracted by their approach, had taken the opportunity of unfurling its wheeling train, a man came forward from the bow window.|$|E

60|$|In {{talk like}} this they were drawing near the little rustic village of Braithwaite, and saw, above {{a cloud of}} foliage, the small, low, battlemented tower, the gray stones of which had {{probably}} been laid a little after the Norman conquest. Approaching nearer, they passed a thatched cottage or two, very plain and simple edifices, though interesting to Redclyffe from their antique aspect, which denoted that they were probably older than the settlement of his own country, and might very likely have nursed children who had gone, {{more than two centuries}} ago, to found the commonwealth of which he was a citizen. If you considered them in one way, prosaically, they were ugly enough; but then there were the old latticed windows, and there the thatch, which was verdant with leek, and strange weeds, possessing a whole botanical growth. And birds flew in and out, as if they had their homes there. Then came a row of similar cottages, all joined on together, and each with a little garden before it divided from its neighbors by a hedge, now in full verdure. Redclyffe was glad to see some symptoms of natural love of beauty here, for there were plants of <b>box,</b> <b>cut</b> into queer shapes of birds, peacocks, etc., as if year after year had been spent in bringing these vegetable sculptures to perfection. In one of the gardens, moreover, the ingenious inhabitant had spent his leisure in building grotto-work, of which the English are rather ludicrously fond, on their little bits of lawn, and in building a miniature castle of oyster-shells, where were seen turrets, ramparts, a frowning arched gateway, and miniature cannon looking from the embrasures. A pleasanter and better adornment were the homely household flowers, and a pleasant sound, too, was the hum of bees, who had their home in several beehives, and were making their honey among the flowers of the garden, or come from afar, buzzing dreamily through the air, laden with honey that they had found elsewhere. Fruit trees stood erect, or, in some instances, were flattened out against the walls of cottages, looking somewhat like hawks nailed in terrorem against a barn door. The male members of this little community were probably afield, {{with the exception of one}} or two half-torpid great-grandsires, who [were] moving rheumatically about the gardens, and some children not yet in breeches, who stared with stolid eyes at the passers-by; but the good dames were busy within doors, where Redclyffe had glimpses of their interior with its pavement of stone flags. Altogether it seemed a comfortable settlement enough.|$|E

During these tests, methane gas was uniformly released at the end of the 40 -ft <b>box</b> <b>cut.</b> Methane concentrations measured 0. 3 m (1 ft) from the roof and face of the <b>box</b> <b>cut</b> were used to estimate face airflow quantities. Fresh air flow rates of 1. 89 and 4. 72 m/sec (4, 000 and 10. 000 cfm), scrubber flow rates of 0, 4, 000 and 10, 000 cfm, water spray pressures of 0 and 3827 kPa (0 and 120 psi), and a blowing curtain setback position of 15. 2 m (50 ft) were used during these tests.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Carborough Downs Coal Mine was {{developed}} from a <b>box</b> <b>cut</b> using three entries, one {{for men and}} materials, one for the conveyor and one return portal. The initial drivage was conducted by drill and blast and each access was ventilated by a Flaktwoods 27 m 3 /s 1058 50 kW fan. The <b>box</b> <b>cut</b> fan installation was transferred from the sister mine in NSW and installed on the portal. After 18 months the shock losses in the fan to adit adaptor were severely affecting the ability {{to increase the number}} of development units operating in the mine. It was decided to perform a fan upgrade prior to the installation of the main fans and fan shaft in March 2009. The fan housing adaptor was modified to reduce the shock losses and the motors and gearboxes were upgraded at the same time. The planning processes, minor ventilation changes and supervision which were conducted to maintain mine ventilation during the overhaul period are discussed. The three Flaktwoods 1058 fans were bolted into a shipping container and monitored for flow, pressure and vibration to suit the requirements of the Queensland legislation and the ventilation maintained with in the mine at 75 m 3 /s down from 145 m 3 /s with the original fans. The upgraded ventilation capacity achieved was 245 m 3 /s. Two of these fans are currently being used in series to ventilate the new conveyor drift with a design capacity of 28 m 3 /s a...|$|E

40|$|The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe cut 2 (+) gene is {{essential}} for sister chromatid separation. Cut 2 protein, which locates in the interphase nucleus and along the metaphase spindle, disappears in anaphase with the same timing as mitotic cyclin destruction. This proteolysis depends on the APC (Anaphase-Promoting Complex) -cyclosome which contains ubiquitin ligase activity. The N-terminus of Cut 2 contains two stretches similar to the mitotic cyclin destruction box. We show that both sequences (33 RAPLGSTKQ and 52 RTVLGGKST) serve as destruction boxes and are required for in vitro polyubiquitination and proteolysis. Cut 2 with doubly mutated destruction boxes inhibits anaphase, whereas Cut 2 with singly mutated <b>boxes</b> can suppress <b>cut</b> 2 mutations.
