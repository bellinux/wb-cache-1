40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new and innovative concept for the control of backlash in gear-coupled robotic mechanisms. The concept utilizes redundant unidirectional drives to assure positive coupling of gear meshes at all times. Based on this concept, a methodology for the enumeration of admissible redundant-drive <b>backlash-free</b> robotic mechanisms has been established. Some typical two-and three-DOF mechanisms have been sketched. Furthermore, actuator torques have been derived as functions of either joint torques or end-effector dynamic performance requirements. A redundantly driven manipulator has the fail-safe advantage in that, except {{of the loss of}} backlash control, it can continue to function when one of its actuators fails. It does not have the compliance problem associated with tendon-driven manipulators.

40|$|Traditional azimuth-elevation ("az-el") stages {{are used}} to point a variety of devices ranging from large optical telescopes to tank guns. Such a stage {{typically}} has an elevation stage having a horizontal axis mounted on an azimuth stage with a vertical axis. Both stages are often motorized. Optical communications transceivers often require two-axis motorized control, as when the communications link is between a ground station and an aircraft or satellite. In such applications, the traditional azimuth-elevation stage has two important drawbacks: a gimbal lock exclusion zone at zenith and susceptibility to pointing errors caused by backlash. Az-el stages in which the azimuth stage cannot rotate a full 360 deg have the additional drawback of an azimuth exclusion zone. The diagonal-axes stage described here mitigates or eliminates all of these problems. Instead of one vertical axis and one horizontal axis, a diagonal-axes stage has two horizontal axes, both oriented at 45 to the trajectory of the target. For example, a ground station located on the equator tracking a satellite with an equatorial orbit would have one axis parallel to northeast and southwest, and the other axis parallel to northwest and southeast. The diagonal-axes stage is considerably less vulnerable to backlash. If it is correctly oriented, its axes rotate in only one direction during an overhead pass by a satellite. As a result, the effects of backlash may be inherently eliminated. If the gravity-induced torque on either axis changes during the pass, then backlash may become important during {{the part of the}} pass where the gravity torque, instead of opposing the motion of the stage, pushes the stage in the direction of motion. This can result in the loss of gear-to-gear contact in one or more stages of the gear reduction mechanism. In this case, a preload spring used to eliminate backlash need only be sufficiently strong to overcome the gravity torque, i. e. it need not overcome friction in the gear train. The diagonal-axes stage is not <b>backlash-free</b> for arbitrary target trajectories such as an aircraft might execute. If properly oriented for any particular satellite, however, it is <b>backlash-free</b> for all passes of that satellite, which will trace out parallel paths on the sky, and for all passes of any other satellite that are perpendicular to the first. It will also be <b>backlash-free</b> for some fraction of other satellite trajectories...|$|E

The arm is unique in that it achieves reasonable performance for the envisioned tasks (<b>backlash-free,</b> sub- 3 mm repeatability, moves at 1. 5 m/s, 2 kg payload) but with a significantly lower parts cost than comparable manipulators. The paper explores the design decisions and tradeoffs made in achieving this combination of price and performance.

40|$|To {{enable a}} {{realistic}} virtual prototyping of both actuated and unactuated rotatory car doors, a dedicated haptic device is developed. A fundamental {{issue is the}} derivation of the specific requirements for this interface, which is done based on knowledge of the typical user interaction with a car door and a comprehensive model {{of the dynamics of}} an actuated as well as an unactuated car door. The findings are that the device should only exhibit one rotatory degree-of-freedom, which should be actuated by a direct drive with a high torque output (≥ 100 Nm) and very high position resolution (≥ 16 Bit). A suitable direct-drive is selected and combined with other elements to form a <b>backlash-free,</b> very stiff haptic device. Due to both force and acceleration sensing, it can serve for the haptic rendering of actuated as well as unactuated car doors. Furthermore, a thorough safety scheme ensures a safe operation of the human-system-interaction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The ITER ECH {{heating and}} current drive system {{delivers}} 24 MW (170 GHz), {{which can be}} directed to either the equatorial (EL) or upper (UL) port launching antennas depending on the desired physics application. The UL design uses two front steering (FS) mirror that sweep eight beams in a poloidal plane providing co-ECCD over the outer half of the plasma cross section. A novel frictionless, <b>backlash-free</b> steering mechanism has been developed for an increased reliability and providing a steering mirror rotation of up to ± 7 o (± 14 º for RF beam).

40|$|Abstract: The {{trend to}} {{miniaturization}} cannot be overseen. The use of very small electronic and electro-optical components {{in a variety}} of consumer and investment goods is leading to an increasing demand for small-scale servo actuators for microassembly applications in production equipment. The previous generation of micro gears and micro actuators was not suited to this type of application, because of unacceptable accuracy. The Micro Harmonic Drive ® gear was introduced into the market in 2001 as the world’s smallest <b>backlash-free</b> micro gear. It is manufactured using a modified LIGA process, called Direct-LIG. This allows the cost-effective production of extremely precise metallic gear components. In the meantime this gear has been implemented in a range of miniaturized servo actuators, which provide zero backlash, excellent repeatability and long operating life. In addition to the above-mentioned advantages this innovative product also features a central hollow shaft. This allows the design engineer to pass an optical fiber, a laser beam or media such as fluids, compressed air or vacuum along the central axis of the servo actuator. This greatly simplifies the design of machines for microassembly applications in the semi conductor, consumer goods, medical and optical fields.

Presented in this project report are the description of the design synthesis that led to the final design, optical and mechanical characteristics of the design, design analysis, hardware and construction considerations, and test results of this three-degree-of-freedom mirror positioner. The apparatus, the only active electro-mechanical device within the optical system, provided real time beam pointing and phasing corrections by simultaneous steering (tip/tilt about two orthogonal axes in plan with the mirror surface) and optical path adjustment (translational motion normal to the mirror surface) of the incident laser beam. Its design is characterized by the requirement for steering and translational adjustment accuracy of 0. 6 microradians and 5 nanometers respectively, at an open-loop operating frequency of 2, 000 Hertz (cps). The complete mirror positioner consists of a high quality laser mirror contained in a strain-free mirror mount. This assembly in turn is supported by a frictionless suspension system. The steering and piston motions of the mirror are provided by a two-stage (coarse and fine) frictionless and <b>backlash-free</b> compound actuation system that is computer controlled for high frequency response. A novel concept using a single actuator for translation motion resulted in a dynamically stable and compact package.

40|$|Over {{its history}} {{electromagnetic}} forming (EMF) has probably seen {{far and away}} more application in assembling tubes or rings onto (or into) nominally axisymmetric mating elements. The vast majority of these assemblies does not require any significant structural integrity or strength. However, {{a small fraction of}} these are designed and fabricated for mechanically-demanding applications. There are two key factors (which seem to be largely independent) that are key in the design and performance of a crimpedelectromagnetic tube joint. First is the state of residual stress that exists after the crimped joint is created. A natural interference fit seems to be a fairly general feature of EMF crimp joints. This interference gives a <b>backlash-free</b> joint that will not fret. The second key issue is the configuration of the joint. The fabrication of designed interlocking geometries is required to create a joint that maximizes mechanical strength while minimizing the electromagnetic energy and forces required to create it. Both of these issues will be considered here. Here we consider crimping onto textured surfaces such as screw threads and knurls. We show experimentally that approaches of this type can give joints that exceed the strength of the tube both in torsion and axial loading. Analysis methods based on coupling impact-indentation and break-before-strip criteria can be used to compare joints made in this way with those based on the more traditional large scale deformation of the tube. One of the advantages of forming onto 'textured' surfaces is that a number of small pulses (possibly generated by small and inexpensive capacitor banks) can be used to create a joint that has the strength of the parent tube, without any heat affected zones or distortion. Again, the natural interference fit developed by impact eliminates the potential for fretting...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a control {{strategy of the}} stable walking for the human-riding biped robot, HUBO FX- 1. HUBO FX- 1 largely consists of two legs with 12 DOF (Degree of freedom), a pelvis and a cockpit. A normal adult can easily ride on HUBO FX- 1 {{by means of a}} foothold and can change the walking direction and speed continuously {{through the use of a}} joystick. Principally, this kind of robot must be able to carry a payload of at least 100 kg in order to carry a person easily. A sufficient payload can be accomplished by two ways. The first is through the choice of a high efficient actuator. The second is through the weight reduction of the robot body frames. As an efficient actuator, a high-power AC servo motor and a <b>backlash-free</b> harmonic drive reduction gear were utilized. Furthermore, the thickness and the size of the aluminum body frames were sufficiently reduced so that the weight of HUBO FX- 1 can be light enough. The disadvantage of the weight reduction is that HUBO FX- 1 was not able to walk stably due to structural vibrations, as the body structures become more flexible due to this procedure. This problem was solved through the use of a simple theoretical model and a vibration reduction controller based on sensory feedback. In order to endow the robot with a stable biped walking capability, a standard walking pattern and online controllers which are based on the real-time sensory feedback were designed. Finally, the performance of the real-time balance control strategy was experimentally verified and the stable dynamic walking of the human-riding biped robot, HUBO FX- 1, carrying one passenger was realized.

40|$|Today {{spot welding}} {{is still the}} most applied joining {{technique}} in the automotive industry. But new developed materials require the adaption and enhancement of this technology for a robust joining process. Investigations were focused on weld-ability of high- and ultra high strength steels like HT 700 T (TRIP steel) or 22 MnB 5 (press hardening steel) by using a servo-mechanical drive for electrode force as well as power control instead of conventional welding current controller. The results of the experiments showed that the TRIP-steel as well as the press hardening steel can be safely welded with an electrode force of more than 5 kN and an welding current of about 8 kA. Best results were achieved with a process control using multiple current impulses. By using an after-heat impulse hardness of spot welds is decreased and the failure mode of the specimen during the chisel test could be improved. The course of hardness across the spot weld lens as well as inside of the base material is already on a high level but drops significantly steep inside of heat affected zone (HAZ). The advantage of the servo mechanical electrode drive is the <b>backlash-free</b> threaded spindle which leads to an increase of electrode force because of the thermal expansion of material during heating up to melting temperature. This effect improves the weldability of 22 MnB 5 and leads to an increase in tool-life time of the spot welding electrodes. The use of process control with controlled welding power in conjunction with a multi impulse process have favorable effects on the results of the tensile tests and ensures a robust welding process. It could be proven that, if the appropriate welding parameters are chosen, joining of HT 700 T as well as 22 MnB 5 by resistance spot welding is possible where the welded connections fulfill the requirements of quality in respect of lens diameter, connection strength and failure mode...|$|E
40|$|As the {{development}} of light-weight, small volume and versatile manipulators has grown {{in the field of}} robotics, the need for more efficient and relevant power transmission systems in the manipulators has become increasingly apparent. It is clear that the advent of efficient, low friction, and <b>backlash-free</b> actuation systems promises to provide significant gains in manipulator performance. Tendon transmission has been widely used to actuate small volume and light-weight articulated manipulators, such as dextrous mechanical hands, for it permits actuators to be installed remotely from the end-effector, thus reducing the bulk and inertia of the manipulator system. Current research on such actuation systems is accomplished on the basis of specialized designs. The lack of systematic approaches has limited our scope in realizing our scope in realizing performance of such transmission systems. Therefore, when associated with systematic methodologies, the study of tendon-driven manipulators promises to be of major importance in the field of robotics. This dissertation is concerned with four issues to enhance our use and understanding of tendon-driven manipulators. First, a systematic approach for the kinematic analysis of tendon-driven manipulators is established. Graph is used to represent the kinematic structure of tendon-driven manipulators. It is shown that the kinematic structure of tendon-driven manipulators is in every way similar to that of epicyclic gear trains. The fundamental circuit equation developed for the kinematic analysis of epicyclic gear trains can thus be applied to this type of mechanism. The displacement equation governing joint angle space and tendon space can be easily obtained. Secondly, the concept of structural isomorphism and the structural characteristics of tendon-driven manipulators are investigated. Based on the explored properties, a methodology for the enumeration of tendon-driven manipulators is developed. By applying the methodology, a class of kinematic structures having pseudo-triangular structure matrix is enumerated. Thirdly, a method for assessing the kinematic/static performance of tendon- driven manipulators is developed. Transmission ellipsoids of the manipulators are investigated. A criterion for differentiating force transmission characteristics and a procedure for identifying least maximum- tendon-force are established. Based on the rationale developed, it is shown that optimal kinematic structure can be achieved fir certain types of tendon routings. Finally, the dynamic characteristics of tendon-driven manipulators are examined in detail. When integrating with a control algorithm in the manipulator, the dynamic performance of tendon-driven manipulators is realized and identified with more fidelity...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, {{the concept}} of {{transmission}} lines for topological synthesis of articulated gear mechanisms is introduced. It is shown that the structure matrix, which related input displacements to the joint angles of a multi-degree-of- freedom articulated gear mechanisms, can be derived using {{the concept of}} transmission lines. Applying {{the characteristics of the}} structure matrix, a new methodology for the topological synthesis of articulated gear mechanisms has been established. All the basic admissible structure matrices of conventional, three-DOF (degree-of-freedom), geared robotic mechanisms have been enumerated. Furthermore, an innovative concept for the control of gear backlash in robotic mechanisms has been conceived. The concept utilizes redundant unidirectional drives to assure positive coupling of gear meshes at all time. It is shown that, through proper arrangement of gear trains, backlash of an N-DOF robotic mechanism can be completely eliminated by a minimum of (N + 1) unidirectional drives. A methodology for the enumeration of admissible RBR (Redundant-drive <b>Backlash-free</b> Robotic) mechanisms has been established. This class of mechanisms also has the fail-safe advantage in that, unless there is loss of backlash control, the mechanisms can continue to function whenever any one of its actuators fails. The actuator sizing has been studied for a general class of N-DOF RBR mechanisms. The actuator torques are given in term of either the joint torques or the end-effector dynamical performance requirement. The methodology for the determination of actuator size can also be applied to tendon-driven robotic mechanisms. Frictional forces in gear-coupled robotic mechanisms can have significant effect on the manipulator dynamics and control and are therefore also included in this study. Gearing efficiency for various gear drives, e. g., two mating gears, N mating gears with a common carrier, and gear trains, has been investigated. As an example, the frictional effect has been demonstrated where it involves the dynamics of a two-DOF RBR arm. In order to demonstrate this concept, a two- DOF experimental RBR arm has been constructed. A computed torque with PD control scheme is implemented in the experimental RBR robot. An experiment using a laser tracking system to verify the improvement of repeatability was conducted. In order to compare the performance difference, two control algorithms, one with redundant drives and the other without, were used in this experiment. The result of this experiment has shown that use of redundant drives greatly improves the repeatability...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{development}} and application of a robotic system for in-vitro biomechanical testing to study the mechanisms leading to human joint injury and degeneration in an ethical and safe manner. Six degree of freedom (6 -DOF) robotic-based systems, in particular Gough-Stewart platform-based systems, have been increasingly used in applications of biomechanical testing where 6 -DOF mobility, large load capacity, and high stiffness and positioning accuracy are required from the testing machine. This study proposes a novel Gough-Stewart platform-based manipulator with ultra-high stiffness and accuracy for use in biomechanical testing and investigates its mechanism and control. Not only restricted to biomechanical testing, the proposed manipulator concept can also be applied to other robotic-based applications, particularly those requiring ultra-high accuracy positioning under large external loads (e. g machining). Four main features of the proposed manipulator are individually studied in this thesis: namely, stiffness and control of a non-collocated actuator-sensor mechanism, active preload control using actuation redundancy for backlash elimination, adaptive velocity-based load control of human joints for unconstrained testing, and reproducing the in-vivo measured kinematics on human cadaveric joints. Stiffness and Control of the Non-collocated Actuator-Sensor Mechanism A novel Gough-Stewart platform-based mechanism is proposed with a fully decoupled actuator-sensor arrangement for passively compensating the structural compliance of the manipulator. The stiffness of the robot load frame and the sensing frame are respectively quantified using the robot kinematics error model combined with finite element analysis (FEA) {{on the top and}} bottom assemblies. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism improves the stiffness of the robotic testing system in excess of an order of magnitude on the translational axes and two orders of magnitude for rotational axes compared to a traditional actuator-sensor collocated design. Control disturbances arising from actuator-sensor non-collocation is addressed using decoupled control. Experimental results show that the proposed decoupled control algorithm improves the dynamic accuracy of the manipulator by approximately 25 % on average. Active Preload Control Using Actuation Redundancy for Backlash Elimination This thesis investigates combining the benefits of both active and passive preload control methods, using actuation redundancy to prevent backlash on a general Gough- Stewart platform. Both the mechanical configuration and the dynamics model of the redundant manipulator are investigated for the ease of control. A novel online optimization algorithm combined with a feedback force control scheme is formulated to achieve a real-time method which is robust to both model inaccuracy and load disturbance. Simulation results demonstrate an effective preload efficacy by the redundant arrangement within the workspace of the robot. Simulation results also show that the proposed method can effectively achieve <b>backlash-free</b> positioning of the manipulator under large 6 -DOF external loads. Experimental results further prove that the proposed method can eliminate backlash instabilities from control and consequently higher bandwidth control can be achieved by the robot with improved accuracy. Adaptive Velocity-based Load Control of Human Joint for Unconstrained Testing A novel adaptive velocity-based load control method is proposed in this thesis to more effectively achieve pure force or moments on human joints under unconstrained testing compared to existing methods. The force/moment control gains are designed to vary adaptively based on the tracking performance of the force/moment to make a compromise between load following and control stability, which makes the proposed method self-adaptive to unknown joint dynamics. Sheep functional spinal units are used to experimentally validate the method on the custom-built Gough-Stewart platform-based manipulator. Experimental results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method, which can be further improved when overcoming certain limitations of the system (e. g. load sensor noise, position inaccuracy arising from backlash, etc.) Reproducing the In-vivo Measured Kinematics on Human Cadaveric Joints This thesis develops a method to scientifically reproduce the general in-vivo kinematics measured from a living human on human cadaver joints using the custom-built Gough-Stewart platform-based manipulator. A human wrist is used as a typical example to elaborate the theory of the method and to assess the fidelity of the method. The proposed method uses a 3 -D motion capture system to collect the in-vivo wrist kinematics from 12 patients undertaking hammering motion. In parallel, CT scans and static motion capture are undertaken on 8 cadaveric human wrist specimens in an effort to define the locations of the coordinate systems. Consequently the in-vivo measured wrist kinematics is transformed to the kinematics of the robotic testing system, which is used to reproduce the hammering motion. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the reproduced motion on the cadaveric samples is of similar magnitude to the measurement error of the motion capture system. Experimental results also show that the assumption of fixed wrist joint centre of rotation is valid for motion reproduction. Thesis (Ph. D.)
