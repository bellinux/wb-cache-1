25|$|To {{those who}} worked with him at Bazaar, the {{pinnacle}} of Brodovitch's career as a designer was the unfailing elegance of his pages. This elegance, combined with an element of innovation was the ideal mix for a fashion magazine. The quality that guaranteed his success was his devotion to the new, unending surprise and vitality. Frances MacFadden, Bazaars managing editor for much of Brodovitch's tenure, explained his working method:It was a pleasure to watch him work. He was so swift and sure. In emergencies, like the time the Clipper bearing the report of the Paris Collections was held up in Bermuda, his speed was dazzling. A quick splash or two on the cutting board, a minute's juggling of the photostats, a slather of art gum, and the sixteen pages were complete. His layouts, of course, were the despair of copywriters whose cherished tone poems on girdles or minks had to be sacrificed to his sacred white space. Just <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> to press, all the layouts were laid out in sequence on Carmel Snow's floor, and there, under his eye, re-arranged until the rhythm of the magazine suited him.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the album {{influenced}} post-punk band Joy Division as bassist Peter Hook related it: [...] "We {{were introduced to}} Kraftwerk by [...] Ian Curtis, who insisted we play Trans Europe Express <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> on stage every time. The tape was played at the venue over the PA system, to be heard by everyone. The first time was Pips [...] Ian got thrown out for kicking glass around the dance floor {{in time to the}} track. It took us ages of pleading to get him back in." [...] Drummer Stephen Morris also confirmed that Joy Division [...] "used to play Trans-Europe Express <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> on stage, to get us into the zone. It worked because it gets up a lot of momentum. Trans-Europe Express just seemed to express an optimism - even if people see it as machine music". Morris also said: [...] "It reminds me of Cabaret, the film, with all of the 1920s singing. [...] When you get that marriage between humans and machines, and you get it right, it's fantastic. I have to say it's my favourite Kraftwerk album." [...] In the mid-1980s, Siouxsie and the Banshees' rendition of [...] "The Hall of Mirrors", on their album Through the Looking Glass, {{was one of the few}} cover versions that [...] Ralf Hütter hailed in glowing terms as [...] "extraordinary".|$|E
500|$|... "The End of All Things" [...] began a four-week {{break for}} the series, though the {{producers}} initially thought this gap would commence with the following episode. They were pleased that the switch did not cause issues, with Pinkner noting that [...] "we’re sort of in a zone of episodes where each one is amazing and each one either turns the story or resolves something important or there’s a cliffhanger– several episodes where each one is pretty awesome in itself and {{is also important to}} the overall patchwork of the season. We were very happy this ended up being one <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> on a little break. I think the fans are going to be well satisfied to come back and watch the next one as well." ...|$|E

500|$|Filming {{of the two}} episodes {{occurred}} from September 25, 2015, until October 15, 2015. The Flashs {{episode was}} directed by Ralph Hemecker, and Arrows by Thor Freudenthal. Berlanti discussed the logistic nightmare of bringing the three series together since {{the first couple of}} episodes of Legends of Tomorrow had already been shot before the filming of the crossover episodes. In addition, there were characters from The Flash and Arrow [...] "that we were also shooting out of those respective shows <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> into shooting Legends to then have to come back and do the introduction of some of the characters here." [...] Falk Hentschel described the filming as [...] "an acting marathon" [...] constantly moving from one set to another during the day, but had a blast.|$|E
500|$|After the show, {{the band}} posted a public {{statement}} about the incident, thanking their fans for coming despite of the risks involved, and blessing the radicals: [...] "We are proud to call you {{our brothers and sisters}} in Christ. Last but not least we must thank the gig securety and the Belo Horizonte police for escorting us though the angry mob. [...] We do not hate the angry mob who came to hurt us. In fact, our message in our shows is to love your enemy. So God bless everybody who stood outside chanting: Fuck Antestor! Hope we can talk like reasonable people someday over a fresh squeezed juice. Extra special hails to our fans who had the balls to come although they knew it could be dangerous. Antestor salutes you and be blessed." [...] In a newspaper interview with the Norwegian Christian newspaper Dagen two days following the band's safe return to Norway, bassist Erik Normann Aanonsen said that he had prepared himself for the worst-case scenario that the tour could end in death, and he reiterates the band's gratitude to the aggressive Brazilian Satanists stating: [...] "We're now twice as big in Brazil as we were <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> there." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Chabon (pronounced, in his words, [...] "Shea as in Shea Stadium, Bon as in Bon Jovi", i.e., [...] ) {{was born}} in Washington, DC to Robert Chabon, a {{physician}} and lawyer, and Sharon Chabon, a lawyer. Chabon said he {{knew he wanted to}} be a writer when, at the age of ten, he wrote his first short story for a class assignment. When the story received an A, Chabon recalls, [...] "I thought to myself, 'That's it. That's what I want to do. I can do this.' And I never had any second thoughts or doubts." [...] Referring to popular culture, he wrote of being raised [...] "on a hearty diet of crap". His parents divorced when Chabon was 11, and he grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Columbia, Maryland. Columbia, where Chabon lived nine months of the year with his mother, was [...] "a progressive planned living community in which racial, economic, and religious diversity were actively fostered." [...] He has written of his mother's marijuana use, recalling her [...] "sometime around 1977 or so, sitting in the front seat of her friend Kathy's car, passing a little metal pipe back and forth <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> in to see a movie.". He grew up hearing Yiddish spoken by his mother's parents and siblings.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the failed}} effort {{to record a}} new studio album, the Police {{effectively}} disbanded. In the liner notes to the Police's box set Message in a Box, Summers explains: [...] "The attempt to record a new album was doomed from the outset. The night <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> into the studio Stewart broke his collarbone falling off a horse and that meant we lost our last chance of recovering some rapport just by jamming together. Anyway, it was clear Sting had no real intention of writing any new songs for the Police. It was an empty exercise." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{nervousness}} of {{the band}} members, the recording sessions ran smoothly. [...] "We were so ready <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> into the studio, we'd been rehearsing six or seven times a week, and we'd even been rehearsing in pitch black darkness in order to play the songs perfectly without even looking", Åkerfeldt recollected in 2009, speaking to Kerrang! However, the band regretted not having enough time to record the acoustic piece [...] "Requiem". The song was first recorded at Unisound, but the band was unhappy with the result. [...] "Requiem" [...] was then recorded in a studio in Stockholm with Pontus Norgren acting as co-producer. Due to a mix-up in Orchids mastering process, the end of [...] "Requiem" [...] was placed {{at the beginning of}} [...] "The Apostle in Triumph". The band has expressed regret for this, and said it was no fault of their own.|$|E
2500|$|As {{was common}} with inclement conditions, the game {{featured}} many punts {{and very few}} passes. The teams combined for 274 yards {{on the ground and}} only 73 yards in the air. Cannon was the game's leading rusher with 53 yards on thirteen carries, but he also fumbled twice, both times deep in LSU territory. [...] "We had to wait for the rain to stop <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> out and warm up," [...] Cannon remembered, [...] "and when it finally quit raining, things weren't much better. They had these plank bridges over pools of water and slop to get you onto the field." [...] His first fumble came in the first quarter at the LSU twenty, but the Bandits were able to hold Mississippi State to a missed field goal attempt. His second fumble was in the fourth quarter at the 13, and the Tigers again were able to hold the Maroons to a missed field goal.|$|E
2500|$|According to Collins, [...] "What we're {{in court}} {{deciding}} {{seems to be}} a level or two down from what, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> into the jury, we supposed the trial was about, or had been initially about, which was who leaked [...] Some jurors commented at some point: 'I wish we weren't judging Libby. You know, this sucks. We don't like being here.' But that wasn't our choice." [...] Collins described how after 10 days of deliberations, [...] "What we came up with from that was that Libby was told about Mrs. Wilson nine times...We believed he did have a bad memory, but it seemed very unlikely he would not remember about being told about Mrs. Wilson so many times....Hard to believe he would remember on Tuesday and forget on Thursday." [...] Collins told the press [...] "Well, as I said before, I felt like it was a long, you know, haul to get this jury done. And if Mr. Libby is pardoned, I would have no problem with that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kuk Harrell, {{one of the}} {{producers}} of Talk That Talk, spoke on the recording of the album saying: [...] "In addition to touring, we are recording Rihanna's new album. We have a portable studio that we set up at the different hotels that we are staying at. We set up shop anywhere in the hotel. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> on the European leg of Rihanna's Loud tour, we started recording the album in Los Angeles. Rihanna likes to work late hours, so she would come into the studio at 9pm and work until 6am." [...] Continuing Harrell stated [...] "The show was the priority, and then the album. That's how the day was broken up." [...] Expanding on this Harrell stated that Rihanna would perform every night, finish her meet [...] and greet by 1 a.m. Then go to the studio for around two or three a.m. During these session Harrell stated [...] "I’d make the decision based off where I felt her voice was. Knowing she just did two hours of a show and meet-and-greets, I would suggest capturing the stuff that was easier to get like the lower-range stuff so we wouldn’t hurt or damage her voice." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 23, 2012, {{two days}} {{following}} the incident at the iHeartRadio Music Festival, Green Day announced that Armstrong was seeking treatment for an unspecified substance abuse problem. As a result, scheduled appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and The Ellen DeGeneres Show were canceled. According to Claudia Suarez Wright, Tre Cool's ex-wife {{and the mother of}} Armstrong's godson, Armstrong had been drinking heavily in Las Vegas prior to the iHeartMusic Festival, following approximately one year of sobriety. Armstrong gave an interview to Rolling Stone in March 2013 in which he admitted, [...] "I've been trying to get sober since 1997, right around Nimrod". Armstrong discussed how during the 21st Century Breakdown tour in 2009–2010, [...] "There were meltdowns on that tour that were huge". Armstrong detailed his addiction and in particular how it had escalated in the months prior to the release of the Trilogy albums and the performance at iHeart stating that during the summer while touring in Europe, [...] "I was at my pill-taking height at that time, medicating the shit out of myself". Armstrong gave details of a gig at Irving Plaza in New York just over a week before the iHeart incident he [...] "Threw back four or five beers <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> on and probably had four or five when we played. Then I drank my body weight in alcohol after that. I ended up hungover on the West Side Highway, laying in a little park." [...] Green Day subsequently canceled all remaining concert dates for 2012 and early 2013 as Armstrong continued dealing with his personal problems. In late December, the band announced they would return to touring at the end of March. Armstrong later admitted that the substances he had been abusing were alcohol and prescription pills for anxiety and insomnia.|$|E
