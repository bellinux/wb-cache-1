25|$|If the mastopexy {{includes}} simultaneous breast augmentation with submuscular emplacement, {{the surgeon}} observes that the pectoralis major muscle is divided from the sternum and the ribs. After cutting the implant pocket, the surgeon then de-epithelializes the B-pedicle.

For the subglandular emplacement of breast implants, {{the technique is}} different; the de-epithelialization of the pedicle dermis is performed initially, after which an incision is made through the de-epithelialized dermis, {{at the base of}} the vertical limb of the mastopexy, and then, by means of <b>blunt</b> <b>dissection,</b> an implant pocket is cut above the pectoralis major muscle.|$|E
40|$|Background: The Star System (Ekymed S. p. A.) {{is a novel}} {{multipurpose}} sponge {{developed for}} conventional manual laparoscopic surgery.

25|$|The surgeon {{tests the}} closure {{tension of the}} wound sutures by in-folding the breast over the index finger, and towards the {{transposed}} nipple-areola complex, to observe if the skin blanches (whitens) or over-stretches, afterwards, the nipple-areola complex-area dermis is de-epithelialized. In the combined mastopexy–augmentation procedure, wherein the breast prosthesis is emplaced to a submuscular implant pocket, an anaesthetic tumescent solution is injected along the marked incision line. When the breast implant will be emplaced to a subglandular implant pocket, the hypodermic needle penetrates un-resisted into the anatomic plane above the pectoralis major muscle; the tumescent solution anaesthesia allows <b>blunt</b> <b>dissection.</b> After establishing anaesthesia, the surgeon de-epithelializes each edge of skin by undermining it , with a razor scalpel, thereby facilitating {{the closing of the}} surgical wound without tight sutures. In a mastopexy–augmentation, the breast-implant pocket (locale) determines when the surgeon performs the de-epithelialization of the B pedicle; for submuscular implantation, the skin pedicle de-epithelialization is performed after the emplacement; for subglandular implantation, the skin pedicle de-epithelialization is performed before the emplacement.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, Francis Robicsek, {{based at}} Carolinas HealthCare System in Charlotte, North Carolina, {{developed}} the Robicsek procedure.

2500|$|Arthroscopy of the {{temporomandibular}} joint {{is sometimes}} used {{as either a}} diagnostic procedure for symptoms and signs related to these joints, or as a therapeutic measure [...] in conditions like temporomandibular joint dysfunction.

Arthroscopy {{is also used to}} visualize the inside of the joint during certain surgical procedures involving the articular disc or the articular surfaces, similar to laparoscopy. Examples include release of adhesions (e.g., by <b>blunt</b> <b>dissection</b> or with a laser) or release of the disc. Biopsies or disc reduction can also be carried out during arthroscopy.

30|$|Several managements for esophageal {{perforation}} {{have been}} reported such as conservative treatment, esophagectomy, endoscopic clipping, and endoscopic placement of stent [7, 8] as two cases were treated by a covered esophageal stent [6]. In the current case, esophageal perforation occurred in the irradiated esophagus, which might be too friable and vulnerable to tolerate the placement of metal stent. There are several case reports that a covered self-expandable and retrievable stent (HANAROSTENT) was effective and successfully manage the esophago-gastric anastomosis fistula [9, 10]. Although HANAROSTENT {{could have been a}} possible choice in this case, we considered that the separation of the gastrointestinal contents from the severely infected mediastinum would be the most reliable measure to manage this critical vertebral infection. Nonetheless, the patient’s severe pulmonary dysfunction (vital capacity of 2.31  l and FEV 1.0 of 0.52  l) made the transthoracic esophagectomy an unsuitable choice. Therefore, we consider the nontransthoracic esophagectomy and delayed reconstruction as a necessary and adequate procedure for this complicated esophageal perforation. The upper mediastinal anatomical structures adjacent to the esophagus may be susceptible to surgical injuries owing to the previous radiotherapy, periesophageal abscess formation, and adhesive changes. Therefore, conventional transhiatal esophagectomy would not be a suitable choice because it includes blind and <b>blunt</b> <b>dissections.</b> The use of mediastinoscope was advantageous to confirm the surgical view directly and prevented secondary injuries on the anatomical structures adjacent to the esophagus.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAdvances in our {{understanding}} of sensory-motor integration suggest a unique role of the frontal lobe circuits in cognition and behaviour. Long-range afferent connections convey higher order sensory information to the frontal cortex, which in turn responds to internal and external stimuli with flexible and adaptive behaviour. Long-range connections from and to frontal lobes have been described in detail in monkeys but little is known about short intralobar frontal connections mediating local connectivity in humans. Here we used spherical deconvolution diffusion tractography and post-mortem dissections to visualize the short frontal lobe connections of the human brain. We identified three intralobar tracts connecting: i) posterior Broca's region with supplementary motor area (SMA) and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) (i. e., the frontal 'aslant' tract - FAT); ii) posterior orbitofrontal cortex with anterior polar region (i. e., fronto-orbitopolar tract - FOP); iii) posterior pre-central cortex with anterior prefrontal cortex (i. e., the frontal superior longitudinal - FSL faciculus system). In addition more complex systems of short U-shaped fibres were identified in the regions of the central, pre-central, perinsular and fronto-marginal sulcus (FMS). The connections between Broca and medial frontal areas (i. e. FAT) and those between the hand-knob motor region and post-central gyrus (PoCG) were found left lateralized in a group of twelve healthy right-handed subjects. The existence of these short frontal connections was confirmed using post-mortem <b>blunt</b> <b>dissections.</b> The functional role of these tracts in motor learning, verbal fluency, prospective behaviour, episodic and working memory is discussed. Our study provides a general model for the local connectivity of the frontal lobes that could be used as an anatomical framework for studies on lateralization and future clinical research in neurological and psychiatric disorders...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} diffusion-based tractography {{techniques have}} offered a real breakthrough in brain studies. These methods allow, {{for the first}} time, to explore the anatomical organization of white matter pathways in humans, in-vivo and non-invasively. As any other method, diffusion-based tractography has limitations. The inherent limits related to the indirect measurement of the diffusion signal, and the strong dependence of this technique on acquisition, models and algorithm parameters, prevents the reliable reconstruction of some major white matter bundles. This dissertation targets the methods, limitations, improvements, and validation of tracking methods, with applications in neurobiological and clinical research. In particular, the main work focuses on a white matter bundle that represents a notable omission in tractography studies: the acoustic radiation (AR), a major projection sensory pathway conveying auditory information from the thalamus to the auditory cortex. Topographical knowledge of this bundle is scarce, and its in-vivo tractography reconstruction remains challenging, preventing the investigation of auditory and language functional mechanisms in humans. This dissertation investigates, for the first time, the topography of the AR using post-mortem <b>blunt</b> <b>dissections</b> and provides {{a detailed description of}} the trajectory of these fibres and their relationship with major neighbouring white matter bundles. The topographical information is then applied to conduct an investigation on the effects of different MRI acquisition and tractography parameters on the in-vivo tractography reconstruction of the AR. An optimal set of parameters is obtained for AR reconstructions and used to build the first tractography atlas of the acoustic radiation. The AR atlas is then applied to study congenital deaf patients. The optimized reconstruction parameters and the atlas generated in this dissertation may be used in future studies interested in identifying and characterizing the AR. The reliable 3 D reconstruction of this bundle will improve our understanding of the functional mechanisms underlying hearing and language in healthy subjects and patients, as well as in neurosurgical applications...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the aetiology, frequency, presentation, and outcome of <b>blunt</b> cervicocerebral arterial <b>dissection</b> presentations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases were retrospectively identified through the stroke registers at Royal Melbourne Hospital (a tertiary teaching hospital) and Geelong Hospital (a regional referral centre). Medical notes were then reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 18 cases were identified, with ages ranging from 28 to 53 years. Fifty five per {{cent of the}} injuries sustained were to the internal carotid artery and 45 % to the vertebral artery. The majority of the injuries were either spontaneous or associated with trivial forces. Other causes included motor vehicle accidents, falls, and cervical manipulations. Fifty five per cent of patients complained of significant neck pain before presentation. Most patients had delayed presentations, with only 39 % presenting {{on the day of}} the incident. Seventy eight per cent presented with a neurological deficit. Initial computed tomography was normal in 71 % of patients.

The parapatellar approach {{is most often}} used, whereas the subvastus approach is a suitable alternative. Presently, it is unknown, according to true objective measurements, {{which of the two}} is most advantageous. Methods In this prospective randomized double-blind, short-term trial measurements (KSS, WOMAC, PDI, VAS, ability to perform) were obtained at day 1, day 3, 1 week, 6 weeks, and 3 months. Results The subvastus group (n = 20) showed only significantly less extension lag direct postoperative (P = 0. 04) compared with the parapatellar group (n = 20).

At first, the right main pulmonary artery was encircled by approaching between superior vena cava and ascending aorta. However, main tumor was palpable and judged as impossible to transect it to ensure the surgical margin. Therefore, we tried to encircle the right main pulmonary artery {{on the left side}} of the ascending aorta. If it had been difficult to encircle it on the left side, we should have converted to the procedure under cardiopulmonary bypass. However, in this case, it was possible to encircle the vessel by <b>blunt</b> finger <b>dissection</b> and transected it with a surgical stapler. The superior pulmonary vein was also transected with a surgical stapler, but the inferior pulmonary vein could not be identified. Previously, we have added an intercostal incision to confirm the inferior pulmonary vein. However, we used a single thoracoscopic port (11.5  mm in diameter) placed at the 8 th intercostal space on the mid-axillary line in the present patient. This allowed us to detect the inferior pulmonary vein easily, and we transected it safely with a surgical stapler, while avoiding additional intercostal thoracotomy and accomplishing tight pneumonectomy. The patient’s course was uneventful, and he was discharged on postoperative day 16. Nodules in the contralateral lung disappeared after surgery, suggesting that these were non-metastatic lesions.|$|R

Three distal fixed-angle locking screws and two proximal interlocking screws were then applied through the guiding system. After satisfactory realignment and secure fixation were confirmed by fluoroscopy, all provisionally transfixed Kirschner wires were removed and the guide system was disassembled from the intramedullary nail. Local callus from the nascent malunion was morselized to serve as a bone graft for the osteotomy site in 14 patients (87.5  %).

40|$|Introduction: Patients with {{esophageal cancer}} {{frequently}} cannot tolerate thoracotomy {{due to their}} overall debilitated condition. Moreover, some patients have severe adhesions in the thoracic cavity. Eversion stripping of the esophagus is an option for resection in these patients. Presentation of case: A 64 -year-old man was admitted to our institution with the chief complaint of epigastric pain. Endoscopic examination showed a protruding lesion 22  cm from the incisors, with a superficial and circumferential mucosal irregularity on the distal side of the lesion. Biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma. Clinical stage was T 1 b(sm) N 0 M 0, cStage I. In addition to the poor pulmonary status of the patient, adhesions in the intrathoracic cavity were predicted. The {{decision was made to}} perform esophageal resection without a thoracotomy. In order to ensure complete invagination of the esophagus, the esophagus was insufflated prior to stripping. The stripping process was observed with a gastroscope. During the stripping, the esophagus did not bunch up, and stripping was smooth and with minimal resistance. Discussion: The stripping resection of the esophagus is an important option for the esophageal surgeon. In this case report, we describe a new eversion stripping method of the esophagus. This easy and reliable stripping method incorporates intraesophageal insufflation. Conclusion: The indications for <b>blunt</b> esophageal <b>dissection</b> without thoracotomy have been decreasing.
