40|$|The {{effect of}} methylparathion (MPT), a potent insecticide, on the {{reproductive}} {{system of the}} male frog Hoplobaprachus rugulosus was investigated. Male frogs aged 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 months old were exposed to 20 ppm of MPT for 60 days. At {{the end of the}} experiment, animals were sacrificed. Plasma samples were collected and kept at- 200 C until undergoing a testosterone radioimmunoassay. Testes were fixed in <b>Bouin,</b> <b>s</b> solution for histological study. Plasma testosterone levels decreased 10. 50 %, 15. 94 %, 17. 68 %, 29. 05 %, 19. 18 % and 27. 12 % in frogs autopsied at the ages of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 months, respectively. Microscopy studies showed that MPT directly injured leydig cells and affected their cell structure. The histological alterations of leydig cells in all exposed frogs included hydropic swelling, pyknotic nuclei, karyolysis, nuclear membrane disruption and vacuolated interstitial tissue.

40|$|Background: By {{the respect}} of some {{difficulties}} that were produced by high population we must have some information about methods that can control population. Materials and methods: In this investigation the effects of Achillea millefolium L. extract on spermatogenesis in adult Balb/ C mice were studied. The alcoholic (ethanolic) exract of flowers was prepared. The lethal (LD 50) and sublethal dose was determined 1. 7 g/kg/bw and 1. 2 g/kg/bw respectively and it was injected to the 28 - 32 g mice for 5 days. Inspite of experimental group we used intact and sham (received only vehicle) groups. The mice were sacrificed under light ether anesthesia {{two weeks after the}} last dose. Blood samples were taken. The testes and epididymis wer excised, weighed and fixed in <b>Bouin</b> <b>s</b> fixative. The tissues were prepared for histological experiments. Results: In this investigation no difference significant in body weight or in testis weight, volume and diameter was seen. Microscopic studies of testis showed a significant reduction in primary spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa but no changes in seminiferous tubules diameter, Sertoli and Leydig cells were seen (P< 0. 05). Histological examination of seminiferous tubules revealed a general dearrangement and severe reducation in the number of germinal cells. Apoptosis was seen in seminiferous tubules. Many immature spermatids were visualized in the lumem of the ductus epididymides of treated animals. This was accompained by a concomitant reduction in the levels of the LH and testosterone. Conclusion: The results of this work suggest that the extract of this plant may have a temporary antifertile activity in adult male animals...|$|R

Current techniques require some time to form a liquid bridge from the stretching of a droplet. Rapidly stretching a liquid bridge using these methods can cause its breakup if the viscosity is too low. Stretching more slowly allows the bridge to thin and break up before a suitable bridge geometry can be established to provide reliable and accurate rheological data. Using a pulsed surface acoustic wave to eject a jet from a sessile droplet, a capillary bridge may be formed in about 7. 5 ms, about seven times quicker than current methods. With this approach, capillary bridges may be formed from Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids having much lower viscosities-water, 0. 04 % by weight solution of high-molecular-weight (7 MDa) polystyrene in dioctyl phthalate and 0. 25 % fibrinogen solution in demineralized water, for example.

We hypothesize that H 2 O initially present in the MI bubbles was lost to adjacent glass during local, sub-micrometer-scale devitrification prior to sample collection. During MI heating experiments, the H 2 O is redissolved into the vapor in the bubble, where it remains after quenching, at least on the relatively short time scales of our observations.

Indeed, despite some major drawbacks and the concurrence of other extraction techniques, SFE still appears as an environmentally friendly extraction technique offering unique selectivity, in addition to several other advantages such as low time- and solvent-consumption. Applications to both organic and inorganic pollutants from environmental matrices are presented to illustrate the applicability of SFE. Future trends in the environmental field are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Orogenic gold {{mineralization}} at the Damang deposit, Ghana, {{is associated with}} hydrothermal alteration haloes around gold-bearing quartz veins, produced by the infiltration of a H 2 O-CO 2 -K 2 O-H 2 <b>S</b> <b>fluid</b> following regional metamorphism. Alteration assemblages are controlled by the protoliths with sedimentary rocks developing a typical assemblage of muscovite, ankerite and pyrite, while intrusive dolerite bodies contain biotite, ankerite and pyrrhotite, accompanied by the destruction of hornblende. Mineral equilibria modelling was undertaken with the computer program thermocalc, in subsets of the model system MnO-Na 2 O-CaO-K 2 O-FeO-MgO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -CO 2 -H 2 O-TiO 2 -Fe 2 O 3, to constrain conditions of regional metamorphism and the subsequent {{gold mineralization}} event. Metapelites with well-developed amphibolite facies assemblages reliably constrain peak regional metamorphism at ~ 595 °C and 5. 5 kbar. Observed hydrothermal alteration assemblages associated with gold mineralization in a wide compositional range of lithologies are typically calculated to be stable within P-T-X(CO 2) arrays that trend towards lower temperatures and pressures with increasing equilibrium fluid X(CO 2). These independent P-T-X(CO 2) arrays converge and the region of overlap at ~ 375 - 425 °C and 1 - 2 kbar is taken to represent the conditions of alteration approaching equilibrium with a common infiltrating fluid with an X(CO 2) of ~ 0. 7. Fluid-rock interaction calculations with M-X(CO 2) diagrams indicate that the observed alteration assemblages {{are consistent with the}} addition of a single fluid phase requiring minimum fluid/rock ratios on the order of 1. © 2013 John Wiley and Sons Ltd...|$|R
