5|$|In February 1965 the Army asked Bell to {{consider}} different deployment concepts under the Nth Country study. This examined {{what sort of}} system {{would be needed to}} provide protection against an unsophisticated attack with a limited number of warheads. Using Zeus EX, a few bases could provide coverage for the entire US. The system would be unable to deal with large numbers of warheads, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a concern for a system that would only be tasked with beating off small attacks.|$|E
5|$|North American shipped {{spacecraft}} CM-012 to Kennedy Space Center on August 26, 1966 under a conditional Certificate of Flight Worthiness: 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes had to {{be completed}} at KSC. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> all; an additional 623 engineering change orders were made and completed after delivery. Grissom became so frustrated with {{the inability of the}} training simulator engineers {{to keep up with the}} spacecraft changes, that he took a lemon from a tree by his house and hung it on the simulator.|$|E
5|$|Riegels did play, and {{he turned}} in a stellar second half performance, {{including}} blocking a Tech punt. In addition, Lom passed for a touchdown and kicked the extra point, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> enough. Tech would ultimately win the game and their second national championship 8‚Äì7. Georgia Tech's safety score after the wrong way run made {{the difference in the}} outcome of the game, which increased the significance of Roy's mistake. In spite of the loss, the example of how the distraught Riegels was persuaded to pick himself up, return to the field and play so hard during the second half is sometimes used by motivational speakers to illustrate overcoming setbacks.|$|E

25|$|This <b>is</b> a book <b>that</b> contradicts {{itself a}} hundred times; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a {{criticism}} of it, because its author thinks contradictions are a sign of intellectual ferment and vitality. This <b>is</b> a book <b>that</b> systematically distorts and selects historical evidence; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a criticism, because its author thinks <b>that</b> all interpretations <b>are</b> biased, and she regards it as her duty {{to pick and choose}} her facts to favor her own brand of politics. This is a book full of vaporous, French-intellectual prose that makes Teilhard de Chardin sound like Ernest Hemingway by comparison; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a criticism, because the author likes that sort of prose and has taken lessons in how to write it, and she thinks that plain, homely speech is part of a conspiracy to oppress the poor.|$|R

25|$|WR {{recruits}} {{were promised}} uniforms upon reaching boot camp, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> always the case. In fact, {{during the summer}} of 1943, some recruits had to train in civilian clothing until uniforms were available. When the new uniforms arrived, {{they turned out to be}} winter uniforms. The seersucker summer uniforms had yet to be designed. Disputes about fabric, cut, and production had a delaying affect upon delivery. In time, these issues were resolved, and most WR members felt their uniforms were much better looking than those of the other women's military organizations.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} began heavy military spending in 1940, and started drafting millions {{of young men}} that year. By 1945, 17 million had entered service to their country, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> enough to absorb all the unemployed. During the war, the government subsidized wages through cost-plus contracts. Government contractors were paid in full for their costs, plus a certain percentage profit margin. That meant the more wages a person was paid the higher the company profits since the government would cover them plus a percentage.|$|E
25|$|Phil Jaques, an Australian, was the {{dominant}} {{figure for the}} Yorkshire Phoenix in the Roses battle, scoring 72 from number three before being out to countryman Brad Hodge. That lifted the hosts to 165 for 7, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> enough to defend. Matthew Hoggard, the England Test bowler, showed an uncanny knack of being uneconomical, conceding 65 runs in his four overs, and despite two wickets he lost the game for the Phoenix. Brad Hodge ended with 64 not out for the visiting Lancashire Lightning as they won with seventeen balls to spare.|$|E
25|$|In 1642 the English Civil War began. King Charles {{realised}} {{the value}} of the Tyne coal trade and therefore garrisoned Newcastle. A Royalist was appointed as governor. At that time, Newcastle and King's Lynn were the only important seaports to support the crown. In 1644 Parliament blockaded the Tyne to prevent the king from receiving revenue from the Tyne coal trade. Coal exports fell from 450,000 to 3,000 tons and London suffered a hard winter without fuel. Parliament encouraged the coal trade from the Wear to try to replace that lost from Newcastle <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> enough {{to make up for the}} lost Tyneside tonnage.|$|E

25|$|The war {{establishment}} of a Parachute Field Ambulance, was 177 all ranks. Consisting of thirteen doctors in two surgical teams and four sections. The doctors could deal with 330 cases in a twenty-four-hour period. Each surgical team could handle 1.8 operations an hour. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> sustainable, {{and if they were}} required to operate the following day, the team had to be relieved after twelve hours. It was envisaged that during airborne operations, it would not be possible to evacuate casualties until the ground forces had linked up with them. Therefore, the field ambulance had the ability to treat all types of wounds, and provide post-operative care for up to fourteen days. They also had the transport required to evacuate casualties from the Regimental Aid Post (RAP), to the Main Dressing Station (MDS).|$|E
25|$|At first, {{his return}} to Venice was a cordial one {{and he was a}} celebrity. Even the Inquisitors wanted to hear how he had escaped from their prison. Of his three {{bachelor}} patrons, however, only Dandolo was still alive and Casanova was invited back to live with him. He received a small stipend from Dandolo and hoped to live from his writings, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> enough. He reluctantly became a spy again for Venice, paid by piece work, reporting on religion, morals, and commerce, most of it based on gossip and rumor he picked up from social contacts. He was disappointed. No financial opportunities of interest came about and few doors opened for him in society as in the past.|$|E
25|$|On April 1, 2016 just as {{the show}} {{finished}} airing, a post on the BT Toronto's Facebook page was made in regards to Jennifer Valentyne not {{being a part of}} the show anymore.

Kevin and Dina both addressed this over Twitter confirming that this was in fact true to fans asking. Later that evening, on Jennifer's Facebook page she released a statement confirming that it was in fact true.

25|$|Cardinal Galeazzo Marescotti {{watched over}} his beloved nephew and {{was pleased with}} the {{brilliant}} life, but more so with the great culture, munificence, and devotion to God of Francesco Maria. The cardinal had a precise plan: to persuade the pope to elevate the title of the fiefdom of Cerveteri from marquis to prince. Other Roman noble families such as the Aldobrandini, Boncompagni, Borghese and Erba-Odescalchi were made princes by their respective popes. The Ruspolis did not have a pope and it was necessary to make a munificent gesture and to acquire particular merits with the Holy See. In 1707 the cardinal persuaded his nephew to arm a brig to donate to the Holy See. The modern hull with wide sails was delivered in Civitavecchia. Handel had composed for the occasion a choral of white voices on a text greeting the pope king. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> enough to elevate Cerveteri to a principality.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{received}} some funds from Jews in New York, the journal's financial survival was precarious from the start. However, many volunteers helped by selling {{the paper on}} street corners and in workshops. During this time, Rocker was especially concerned with combating the influence of Marxism and historical materialism in London's Jewish labor movement. In all, the Arbeter Fraint published twenty-five essays by Rocker on the topic, the first ever critical examination of Marxism in Yiddish, according to William J. Fishman. Arbeter Fraints unsound financial footing also meant Rocker rarely received the small salary promised {{to him when he}} took over the journal and he depended financially on Witkop. Despite Rocker's sacrifices, however, the paper was forced to cease publication for lack of funds. In November 1899, the prominent American anarchist Emma Goldman visited London and Rocker met her for the first time. After hearing of the Arbeter Fraints situation she held three lectures to raise funds, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> enough.|$|E
25|$|In Flint v Webb the Court {{unanimously}} {{declined to}} issue a certificate {{to appeal to the}} Privy Council, with each judge finding that {{the fact that there was}} a decision of the Privy Council that was inconsistent with a previous decision of the High Court, where the High Court had refused a certificate of appeal, was inconvenient, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> itself a sufficient reason to grant a certificate. Griffith CJ suggested two ways to escape the inconvenient position, (1) make the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court on federal matters exclusive of the State Supreme Court or (2) legislate that the income provided to federal public servants was subject to the rights of the States to tax them. Higgins J described the suggestion that the Commonwealth be deprived of the appellate assistance of the very efficient State Courts as an extreme step. His Honour doubted that the issue could be resolved by federal legislation given that the majority's view in Deakin v Webb rested on constitutional grounds and the federal Parliament had no power to alter the constitution.|$|E
