50|$|Styrax benzoin is {{a species}} of tree native to Sumatra in Indonesia. Common names for the tree include gum <b>benjamin</b> <b>tree,</b> loban (in Arabic), kemenyan (in Indonesia and Malaysia), onycha, and Sumatra benzoin tree.|$|E
40|$|Many {{research}} {{projects have been}} conducted about using ultrasonic sensors to estimate canopy volume. This study investigates using software applications such as artificial neural network (ANN) to improve the estimation of canopy volume by using ultrasonic sensors. A special experimental system was built. The system had three ultrasonic sensors mounted vertically on a wooden pole with an equal distance of 0. 6 m. As the wooden pole moves with a constant speed, the ultrasonic sensors measure the thickness of tree canopy with sampling rate of 4 Hz. Experiments were conducted on 5 samples of <b>Benjamin</b> <b>tree</b> at three speed levels of 35, 45 and 55 cm s- 1 in three replications. The real volume of trees was measured manually with rectangular elements method. After a full passing of ultrasonic sensors, potential features such as canopy diameter, average width of tree canopy and height of the tree canopy were considered as the inputs to the ANN model and the manually volume as {{the output of the}} model. Optimal ANN model was selected based on mean square error and correlation coefficient. The results showed that 13 - 16 - 7 - 1 was the optimal neuron numbers in ANN topology for estimating canopy volume...|$|E
25|$|Benjamin White – {{a working}} {{arborist}} until {{injured in a}} fall from a <b>tree,</b> <b>Benjamin</b> White became an environmental activist, worked as bosun of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, and created the sea turtle costumes worn at the anti-WTO protests in Seattle during 1999.|$|R
5000|$|Franklin is a {{giant sequoia}} in Giant Forest, a sequoia grove where the largest tree in the world lives - the General Sherman. The Franklin tree is the eighth largest giant sequoia in the world. It was named by Wendell Flint after <b>Benjamin</b> Franklin. Nearby <b>trees</b> include the Washington Tree which was once the second largest tree in the world, but since it lost half its trunk in 2005 many sequoias are now larger.|$|R
5000|$|The {{three young}} men working at the Brown Motel {{notified}} Sheriff R.H. Morrow, and at daybreak, these four men followed the trails of the horses used by the lynchers. The horse trails led to the farm of Jim McDonnell, about three-quarters of a mile above Warsaw where, on an isolated tree, they found the corpses of Benjamin and Mollie French hung close together on two different branches of the same <b>tree.</b> <b>Benjamin</b> French's body was nearly touching the ground, while Mollie French's body hung about eighteen inches above the ground. The corpses were already cold and stiff, so it was known that they had died hours ago. It was [...] "a ghastly spectacle".|$|R
50|$|Although {{native to}} China and Japan, {{the plant is}} also found {{where it has been}} {{introduced}} in the southeastern United States, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Taiwan, India, Martinique, Sudan, and southern France. Incorrectly thought to have been introduced in colonial times by <b>Benjamin</b> Franklin, the <b>tree</b> has become naturalized from North Carolina southward along the Atlantic and the entire Gulf coast, where it grows profusely along ditchbanks and dikes. It grows especially well in open fields and abandoned farmland coastal prairie regions featuring disturbed ground—such as abandoned farmland, spoil banks, roadsides, and storm-damaged forests—and along the edges of the Western Gulf coastal grasslands biome, sometimes forming pure stands. In the Houston area, Chinese tallow trees account for a full 23 percent of all trees, more than any other tree species and is the only invasive tree species in the 14 most common species in the area. The Texas Department of Agriculture lists Chinese Tallow as one of the 24 most invasive plants, and includes Chinese Tallow in a list of Noxious and Invasive Plants which are illegal to sell, distribute or import into Texas. Herbivores and insects have a conditioned behavioral avoidance to eating the leaves of Chinese tallow tree, and this, rather than plant toxins, may be a reason for the success of the plant as an invasive.|$|R
