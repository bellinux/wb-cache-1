5000|$|In the {{standard}} steam locomotive firetube type boiler, the firebox {{is surrounded by}} water space on five sides. The bottom of the firebox is open to atmospheric pressure, but covered by fire grates (solid fuel) or a firing pan (liquid fuel). If the engine burns solid fuel, like wood or coal, there is a grate covering most of {{the bottom of the}} firebox to hold the fire. An ashpan, mounted underneath the firebox and below the grates, catches and collects hot embers, ashes, and other solid combustion waste as it falls through the grates. In a coal-burning locomotive, the grates may be shaken to clean dead ash {{from the bottom of the}} fire. They are shaken either manually or (in larger locomotives) by a powered grate shaker. Wood-burning locomotives have fixed grates that can't be shaken. Wood ash is generally powder which will fall through the grates with no more agitation required than the vibrations of the locomotive rolling down the track. The fire grates must be replaced periodically due to the extreme heat they must endure. Combustion air enters through the bottom of the firebox and airflow is usually controlled by damper doors above the ash collection pocket of the ash pan. A locomotive that burns liquid fuel - usually [...] "Bunker C" [...] fuel oil or similar heavy oil - does not have grates. Instead, they have a heavy metal gauge firing pan bolted tight against the bottom of the firebox. The firing pan is covered with firebrick and the firebox has a firebrick lining, usually up to the level of the firebox door, all the way around the firebox. The oil burner is a nozzle containing a slot for the oil to flow out onto a steam jet which atomizes the oil into a fine mist which ignites in the firebox. The oil <b>burner</b> <b>nozzle</b> is usually mounted in the front of the firebox, protected by a hood of firebrick, and aimed at the firebrick wall below the firebox door. Dampers control air flow to the oil fire.|$|E

For better {{resistant}} to erosion, material was hardfaced by Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) by using solid wire electrode and flux cored wire electrode under same welding conditions. The substrate steel hardfaced with flux cored wire electrode resulted in high microhardness as compare to solid wire electrode. The erosion study was conducted, using an air jet erosion test rig at a particle velocity of 50 m/s. Ductile erosion behavior is observed in the case when the substrate steels is hardfaced with solid wire whereas brittle erosion behavior is observed when the substrate steels is hardfaced with flux cored wire. At a low angle of impingement, the abrasive type cutting is the dominating factor for material removal, and at a higher angle of impingement, impact-type as well as abrasive-type cutting actions play critical roles. Plastic deformation characterized by pitting and cutting action was also observed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique was used to analyze the eroded surface. It was concluded that damaged surfaces of Pulverized coal <b>burner</b> <b>nozzle</b> material can be successfully hardfaced and improvement in erosion resistance was observed. ...|$|E

The effect of the injector modifications was to redistribute the hydrogen fuel, increase the air pressure drop, promote premixing of the oxygen and air, and establish a uniform flow pattern where the oxygen-air mixture comes into contact with the hydrogen fuel.

40|$|Increasing fuel {{temperature}} leads to lower fuel density so that {{speed of the}} fuel leaving the nozzle increases causing the fuel to reach the burning point sooner. Hence, a higher temperature can be maintained in the furnace to reduce heat loss.

40|$|The {{stability}} {{limits of}} a jet flame {{can play an}} important role in the design of burners and combustors. This study details an experiment conducted to determine the liftoff and blowout velocities of oblique-angle methane jet flames under various air coflow velocities. A nozzle was mounted on a telescoping boom to allow for an adjustable burner angle relative to a vertical coflow. Twenty-four flow configurations were established using six <b>burner</b> <b>nozzle</b> angles and four coflow velocities. Measurements of the fuel supply velocity during liftoff and blowout were compared against two parameters: nozzle angle and coflow velocity. The resulting correlations indicated that flames at more oblique angles have a greater upper stability limit and were more resistant to changes in coflow velocity. This behavior occurs due to a lower effective coflow velocity at angles more oblique to the coflow direction. Additionally, stability limits were determined for flames in crossflow and mild counterflow configurations, and a relationship between the liftoff and blowout velocities was observed. For flames in crossflow and counterflow, the stability limits are higher. Further studies may include more angle and coflow combinations, as well as the effect of diluents or different fuel types...|$|E

Round and slot <b>burner</b> <b>nozzles</b> with the same cross-sectional area were tested at a constant nozzle-to-plate distance of 2 d. The Reynolds number was selected to range from 1, 000 to 1, 700, {{in order to produce}} a laminar flow. The air/fuel equivalence ratio was extended from 0. 95 to 1. 3 to produce fuel-lean, stoichiometric, and fuel-rich flames. When compared to the round jet, the slot jet provided more uniform heat flux on the impingement plate, but the peak heat flux was not so concentrated. The slot jet produced different heat flux distributions along the length and width of the impingement plate, and the average heat flux was higher along the direction of the slot width (i. e., the plate width) in the present study, especially when the Reynolds number or the equivalence ratio was increased.

Results show that the 2 -d temperature field under different accelerations matched the variation in average temperatures: they both experience three variations at different time and velocity stages. The greater acceleration has a faster change in average temperature with time, due to the accumulation of combustion heat: the smaller acceleration has a higher average temperature at the same speed. No matter what acceleration was used, in time, the flame angle of inclination increased, but the growth rate decreased until an angle of 90 °: this could be explained by analysis of the force distribution within the flame.

The concentration of CS 2 and thiophene was examined in syngas by sulfide detector. For comparison, the sulfur transfer was also studied in coke oven gas under dry and hydrous conditions. When the ratio of O 2 / Gas was 0. 32, complete thiophene and about 83 % of CS 2 in feed gas could be transformed via noncatalytic partial oxidation in the dry condition. It was mainly because of <b>burner</b> <b>nozzle</b> unique structure forming local hyperthemia, which benefited OH, O free radical and active atoms. During steam transforming to produce syngas, the ratio of water to carbon was less than 3, a higher ratio of O 2 /Gas favored sulfur transformation.

40|$|The burning {{characteristics}} {{of natural gas}} and the determination of its inter-changeability with liquefied petroleum gas on domestic burners are presented in this paper. Earlier studies had sought the correlation of heating values with specific gravities {{as a basis for}} determining the interchangeability of the gas.

The Wobbe Number, combustion potential and yellow tip index are calculated for both liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and various compositions representative of associated low-pressure and non-association high pressure natural gas.

It is found that natural gas can be interchanged with LPG as substitute gas for domestic burners, without adjustment of the <b>burner</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The necessary condition for this is that the quality of combustion for the associated natural gas is enhanced when it is fed into the burner above the hydrocarbon and water dew points of the gas, and at twice the pressure at which bottled liquefied petroleum gas is usually supplied to the burners...|$|E
40|$|A {{well-defined}} plasma assisted combustion {{system with}} novel in situ discharge in a counterflow diffusion flame {{was developed to}} study the direct coupling kinetic effect of non-equilibrium plasma on flame ignition and extinction. A uniform discharge was generated between the <b>burner</b> <b>nozzles</b> by placing porous metal electrodes at the nozzle exits. The ignition and extinction characteristics of CH 4 /O 2 /He diffusion flames were investigated by measuring excited OH* and OH PLIF, at constant strain rates and O 2 mole fraction on the oxidizer side while changing the fuel mole fraction. It was found that ignition and extinction occurred with an abrupt change of OH* emission intensity at lower O 2 mole fraction, indicating {{the existence of the}} conventional ignition-extinction S-curve. However, at a higher O 2 mole fraction, {{it was found that the}} in situ discharge could significantly modify the characteristics of ignition and extinction and create a new monotonic and fully stretched ignition S-curve. The transition from the conventional S-curves to a new stretched ignition curve indicated clearly that the active species generated by the plasma could change the chemical kinetic pathways of fuel oxidation at low temperature, thus resulting in the transition of flame stabilization mechanism from extinction-controlled to ignition-controlled regimes. The temperature and OH radical distributions were measured experimentally by the Rayleigh scattering technique and PLIF technique, respectively, and were compared with modeling. The results showed that the local maximum temperature in the reaction zone, where the ignition occurred, could be as low as 900 K. The chemical kinetic model for the plasma–flame interaction has been developed based on the assumption of constant electric field strength in the bulk plasma region. The reaction pathways analysis further revealed that atomic oxygen generated by the discharge was critical to controlling the radical production and promoting the chain branching effect in the reaction zone for low temperature ignition enhancement...|$|R

A study was conducted to investigate the performance of alternative energy sources that are environmentally friendly and renewable such as palm biodiesel. Therefore, this project presents an investigation on the combustion performance of Palm Methyl Ester (PME) which also known as Palm Biodiesel in an oil burner system. Several Carotino’s palm biodiesel blends (B 10, B 20, and B 40) also have been made by blended with Conventional Diesel Fuel (CDF). Examination of the fuel properties for each blends including CDF and PME have been carried out.

Compared to a conventional recovery boiler a black liquor gasifier can increase the total energy efficiency of a chemical pulp mill and produce a synthesis gas {{that can be used}} for production of motor fuel. In Piteå, a 3 MW or 20 tons per day entrained flow pressurized black liquor gasification development plant has been constructed by Chemrec at Energy Technology Center. The plant has been run more than 12 000 h since 2005. One of the key parts in the gasification process is the spray <b>burner</b> <b>nozzle</b> where the black liquor is disintegrated into the hot gasifier as a spray of fine droplets. In this thesis the spray <b>burner</b> <b>nozzle</b> as characterized with high speed photography in order to visualize the atomization process of black liquor. The results showed that black liquor forms non-spherical and stretched ligaments and droplets with the considered nozzle. Comparison of the results with atomization of a syrup/water mixture showed that the results were qualitatively very similar which means that a syrup/water mixture can be used instead of black liquor for burner optimization experiments. This is a considerable experimental simplification. Also spatially resolved measurements of the gas composition in the development plant with a water cooled quench probe have been performed. From the gas composition measurement and the spray visualization it has been showed that the preheating of black liquor has a significant influence on the gas composition. Another important part in the gasification plant is the counter-current condenser where the gas is cooled and the water content in the gas is condensed away in vertical tubes that are cooled on the outside by a counter-current flow of water or steam. In this thesis a computational fluid dynamics model of the counter-current condenser have been developed. The model consists of a two-phase fluid model on the tube-side of the condenser and a single phase model of the shell side. Predictions from the model are in excellent agreement with temperature measurements from the condenser used in the 3 MW Black Liquor Gasification development plant. However, more validation data is necessary before a definite conclusion can be drawn about the predictive capability of the code, in particular with respect to scale up with about two orders of magnitude for commercial size gas coolersGodkänd; 2011; 20110228 (mikris); LICENTIATSEMINARIUM Ämnesområde: Energiteknik/Energy Engineering Examinator: Adj professor Rikard Gebart, Institutionen för teknikvetenskap och matematik, Luleå tekniska universitet Diskutant: Tekn lic Mats Lindblom, Chemrec, Piteå Tid: Fredag den 1 april 2011 kl 10. 00 Plats: E 231, Luleå tekniska universite...|$|E

An existing combustion chamber with optical access, capable to operate up to 20 bar, was upgraded with an air flow pulsator, that bypasses air from the combustor plenum to the exhaust with a sinusoidal massflow variation up to 700 Hz. Pressure transducers in the plenum and the flametube monitored the forced disturbances. A photomultiplier recorded the OH* chemiluminescence of the flame. For the agreed operating conditions frequency scans of these values were registered. Additionally images of the OH* chemiluminescence were taken at selected frequencies and evaluated in a statistical manner, to separate turbulent and periodic behaviour. From the analysis of the pressure data, it can be concluded, that serious thermo-acoustic feedback was not observed for both burners.

40|$|In {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis, different laser-based techniques were employed for measurements in different combustion devices. Laser-based techniques enable non-intrusive and in-situ measurements to be carried out, in which high spatial and temporal resolution can be obtained. Different parameters related to combustion research can be visualized, such as species concentrations, temperature, velocities and particle sizes. The combustion devices investigated can be related {{in one way or}} another to gas turbine combustion, the measurements being performed in devices ranging from laboratory-scale burners to industrial gas turbine burners. The Triple Annular Research Swirler (TARS) is a laboratory burner that simulates the character of a gas turbine, in terms of both fuel injection and flame stabilization. Studies using planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) were carried out here to demonstrate how different swirler configurations affect flame and flow dynamics and how flashback depends on different operating conditions. Simultaneous measurements of OH PLIF and of acetone PLIF were employed to visualize flame position and fuel distribution, respectively, the measurements being carried out simultaneously with velocity measurements involving particle image velocimetry (PIV). Visualization of flame position and of fuel distribution through use of OH PLIF and acetone PLIF was applied to several industrial gas turbine burners to investigate their combustion characteristics. The measurements were performed on-site at Siemens in Finspång, in burners fueled with natural gas or with a mixture of natural gas and hydrogen. The aim of the experimental investigations was to obtain a better understanding both of the mixing of air and fuel and of the flame dynamics, knowledge of which can hopefully be used to further reduce the emission levels from gas turbines. Part of the experimental results was used for the validation of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, used to simulate the flow and the turbulent combustion inside the combustion chamber. A Multi-YAG laser system which can generate a rapid burst of laser pulses, and a high-speed framing camera capable of recording sequences of up to eight images, were used to study fuel vaporization, and its consequent mixing with air, in a Jet A or biojet fueled gas turbine pilot burner under elevated pressure conditions. Fuel PLIF was used to visualize both the liquid and the gas phase of the fuel, Mie scattering being used to visualize only the liquid phase of the fuel. The liquid phase of the fuel was found, as expected, to be close to the <b>burner</b> <b>nozzle</b> and the evaporated fuel to be found a distance downstream from the <b>burner</b> <b>nozzle.</b> High-speed OH PLIF was also employed for visualizing the flame position.

40|$|Laminar-like and brush-like propane-air flames were {{obtained}} when wire grids {{were used as}} turbulence generators in a 1 / 2 -inch <b>nozzle</b> <b>burner.</b> The laminar-like flames for grid-disturbed flow had a slightly higher burning velocity than "true" laminar flames (no grid used). The brush-like flames {{were similar to those}} obtained with pipe turbulent flow. Their burning-velocity dependence on a "flow disturbance" Reynolds number compared favorably with that obtained for pipe turbulent flames. Hot-wire-anemometer equipment was used to measure the flow disturbance intensity in the cold flow with and without the grids in place...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cooktop burners {{are widely}} used nowadays. In cooktop <b>burner</b> design, <b>nozzle</b> {{efficiency}} and greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions mainly depend on heat transfer from the premixed flame to the impinging surface. This is a complicated issue depending on the individual and combined effects of various input combustion variables. Optimal operating conditions for sustainable burner design were rarely addressed, {{especially in the case}} of multiple slot-jet burners. Through evaluating the optimal combination of combustion conditions for a premixed slot-jet array, this paper develops a practical approach for the sustainable design of gas cooktop burners. Efficiency, CO and NOx emissions in respect of an array of slot jets using premixed flames were analysed. Response surface experimental design were applied to three controllable factors of the combustion process, viz. Reynolds number, equivalence ratio and jet-to-vessel distance. Desirability Function Approach(DFA) is the analytic technique used for the simultaneous optimization of the efficiency and emission responses. Keywords—optimization, premixed slot jets G I...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{effort on}} {{the environmental impacts of}} fossil fuel based power generation has led to increased research with the aim of reducing emissions and improving combustion efficiency by turning to alternative fuel such as biodiesel. But the hazardous emission caused by biodiesel is still a problem that need to tackle. One of way to achieve this is by choosing the correct nozzle characteristic. In the current study, the effect of nozzle angle on mixture formation and combustion characteristic are investigate using air-assisted fuel atomizing biodiesel <b>burner.</b> The <b>nozzle</b> angle that was used are θ = 450 and 500. The results show with nozzle 450 produce lower spray penetration, but higher spray angle and spray area compare to nozzle 500. The result are similar on flame development. For the emission characteristic, theCarbon Monoxide (CO) and Hydro Carbon (HC) emission had a strong reduction by using nozzle with 450 angle compare to 500 angl...|$|R
