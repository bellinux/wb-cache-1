500|$|Macrae {{credits the}} Australian army with {{developing}} {{the technique of}} slapping a sticky bomb directly onto a tank instead of throwing it from a relatively safe distance. Since the bomb used a blast effect, {{it was safe to}} do this and walk away provided only that the bomb's handle was pointing away from the bomber – the handle would be shot away from the explosion [...] "like a bullet." [...] Macrae gives no date for the development of this tactic. Macrae confirmed that placing the bomb rather than throwing it gives <b>better</b> <b>adhesion</b> and allows thicker plates to be penetrated.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1840s, express {{passenger}} locomotive design was focussed {{on the need}} for single large-diameter driving wheels of around [...] The wheel diameter is effectively the [...] "gear ratio" [...] of a steam engine, and large driving wheels delivered the high linear tyre speed needed for fast locomotives, whilst keeping the axle bearing and piston speeds low enough to remain within the limits of the existing technology. Later on, increasing engine power would require <b>better</b> <b>adhesion</b> than a single pair of driving wheels could provide, but that was not a problem at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{industrial}} and medical applications exist for silane and functionalized silanes. For instance, silanes {{are used as}} coupling agents to adhere fibers such as glass fibers and carbon fibers to certain polymer matrices, stabilizing the composite material. In other words, silane coats the glass fibers to create <b>better</b> <b>adhesion</b> to the polymer matrix. They {{can also be used}} to couple a bio-inert layer on a titanium implant. Other applications include water repellents, masonry protection, control of graffiti, applying polycrystalline silicon layers on silicon wafers when manufacturing semiconductors, and sealants. The semiconductor industry used about 300 metric tons per year of silane in the late 1990s. More recently, a growth in low-cost solar photovoltaic module manufacturing has led to substantial consumption of silane for depositing hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) on glass and other substrates like metal and plastic. The PECVD process is relatively inefficient at materials utilization with approximately 85% of the silane being wasted. To reduce that waste and the ecological footprint of a-Si:H-based solar cells further several recycling efforts have been developed.)". , [...]|$|E

2500|$|In {{painting}} buon fresco, a rough underlayer {{called the}} arriccio {{is added to}} the whole area to be painted and allowed to dry for some days. Many artists sketched their compositions on this underlayer, which would never be seen, in a red pigment called sinopia, a name also used to refer to these under-paintings. [...] Later,new techniques for transferring paper drawings to the wall were developed. [...] The main lines of a drawing made on paper were pricked over with a point, the paper held against the wall, and a bag of soot (spolvero) banged on them on produce black dots along the lines. If the painting was to be done over an existing fresco, the surface would be roughened to provide <b>better</b> <b>adhesion.</b> [...] On the day of painting, the intonaco, a thinner, smooth layer of fine plaster was added to the amount of wall that was expected to be completed that day, sometimes matching the contours of the figures or the landscape, but more often just starting {{from the top of the}} composition. [...] This area is called the giornata ("day's work"), and the different day stages can usually be seen in a large fresco, by a sort of seam that separates one from the next.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of composites strongly {{depend on the}} type of filler-polymeric matrix interface. An interface characterized by a strong bond between the filler and the matrix generally results in better {{mechanical properties}}. In this work, polypropylene, PP, was used as polymeric matrix and silica short fibers, SF, which are amorphous biogenic silica, were employed as filler. In order to promote a <b>better</b> filler-matrix interfacial <b>adhesion,</b> these fibers were previously modified with vinyltrimethoxysilane. The composites were prepared by extrusion and injection molding processes and their mechanical properties were evaluated according to tensile testing, ASTM D 268, by means a fractional factorial design (25 - 1).

The composite cryogenic fractured surfaces were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy, FESEM.
