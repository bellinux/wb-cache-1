5|$|In Australia, 2012 {{estimates}} {{indicate that}} there are more than 7.2million red foxes with a range extending throughout most of the continental mainland. The species became established in Australia through successive introductions by settlers in 1830s in the British colonies of Van Diemen's Land (as early as 1833) and the Port Phillip District of New South Wales (as early as 1845) for the purpose of the traditional English sport of fox hunting. A permanent fox population was not established on the island of Tasmania and it is widely held that they were outcompeted by the Tasmanian devil. On the mainland, however, the species was successful as an apex predator. It is generally less common in areas where the dingo is more prevalent, however it has, primarily through its burrowing behaviour, achieved niche differentiation with both the feral dog and the feral cat. As such it {{has become one of the}} continent's most invasive species. The red fox has been implicated in the extinction and decline of several native Australian species, particularly those of the family Potoroidae including the desert rat-kangaroo. The spread of red foxes across the southern part of the continent has coincided with the spread of rabbits in Australia and corresponds with declines in the distribution of several medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals, including brush-tailed <b>bettongs,</b> burrowing <b>bettongs,</b> rufous <b>bettongs,</b> bilbys, numbats, bridled nailtail wallabys and quokkas. Most of these species are now limited to areas (such as islands) where red foxes are absent or rare. Local eradication programs exist, although eradication has proven difficult due to the denning behaviour and nocturnal hunting, so the focus is on management with the introduction of state bounties. According to the Tasmanian government, red foxes were introduced to the previously fox-free island of Tasmania in 1999 or 2000, posing a significant threat to native wildlife including the eastern bettong, and an eradication program conducted by the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water has been established.|$|E
25|$|The macropods {{are divided}} into three families: the Hypsiprymnodontidae, with the musky rat-kangaroo as its only member; the Potoroidae, with 11 species; and the Macropodidae, with 45 species. Macropods are found in all Australian environments except alpine areas. The Potoroidae include the <b>bettongs,</b> potaroos and rat-kangaroos, small species that make nests and carry plant {{material}} with their tails. The Macropodiae include kangaroos, wallabies and associated species; size varies widely within this family. Most macropods have large hind legs and long, narrow hind feet, with a distinctive arrangement of four toes, and powerfully muscled tails, which they use to hop around. The musky rat-kangaroo is the smallest macropod and the only species that is quadrupedal not bipedal, while the male red kangaroo is the largest, reaching a height of about 2m and weighing up to 85kg.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of the zoo's smaller mammal species live in the Small Mammal House. The species on display include golden lion tamarins, golden-headed lion tamarins, [...] pale-headed saki monkeys, [...] Geoffroy's marmosets, [...] black howler monkeys, red-ruffed lemurs, black-footed ferrets, banded mongooses, dwarf mongooses, meerkats, a short-eared elephant shrew, [...] brush-tailed <b>bettongs,</b> striped skunks, [...] La Plata three-banded armadillos, screaming hairy armadillos, sand cats, fennec foxs, naked mole-rats, southern tamanduas, rock hyraxs and several others.|$|E

50|$|The {{spread of}} the red fox {{population}} corresponds with declines {{in the distribution of}} several medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals, including brush-tailed <b>bettongs,</b> burrowing <b>bettongs,</b> rufous <b>bettongs,</b> bilbies, numbats, bridled nailtail wallabies and quokkas. Most of these species now only live in limited areas (such as islands) where red foxes are absent or rare.|$|E
50|$|While the {{mainland}} population became extinct in the 1920s, the Tasmanian population has remained secure. One {{concern is that}} most of the <b>bettongs</b> are found on private land, with only two groups found within reserves. Red foxes are a major threat. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has raised the threat status for eastern <b>bettongs</b> from least concern to near threatened.|$|E
50|$|Four {{species of}} <b>bettongs</b> are extant and two are extinct. <b>Bettongs</b> were {{endangered}} because settlers took {{much of their}} habitat, and the foxes they introduced to the continent also killed many of them. At one time, species lived all over Australia. Today, the Tasmanian bettong lives only in {{the eastern half of}} Tasmania, and the northern bettong lives only in three isolated populations in northern Queensland.|$|E

5000|$|Like other <b>bettongs,</b> {{the eastern}} bettong is a {{continuous}} breeder, producing young throughout the year. The gestation period is 21 days, {{after which the}} infant (referred to as a [...] "joey") {{will remain in the}} pouch for an additional 105 days.|$|E
50|$|B. lesueur is very vocal, {{communicating}} through grunts, hisses, and squeals. It shelters in underground burrows, {{the only}} macropodiform to do so. Burrows vary from simple tunnels to complex networks with multiple entrances and deep, interconnecting tunnels. These elaborate burrows, or warrens, {{have been seen}} having from four to 94 entrances. Warrens are communal, housing an average of 20-40 <b>bettongs.</b> <b>Bettongs</b> appear to switch warrens from time to time, though each has one or two preferred warrens. During {{the day in the}} warrens, they form groups of one male and one or many females; males never share warrens with other males. Some of the female-female groups seem to be mother-daughter associations. However, individuals seem to forage alone, showing none of the day-range group associations.|$|E
50|$|Threatened fauna {{found on}} Mount Zero-Taravale include the {{southern}} cassowary, masked owl, northern <b>bettong</b> and northern quoll.|$|R
50|$|The rufous rat-kangaroo (Aepyprymnus rufescens), more {{commonly}} known as the rufous <b>bettong,</b> is a small marsupial species of the family Potoroidae found in Australia. It is found in coastal and subcoastal regions from Newcastle in New South Wales to Cooktown in Queensland, and was formerly found in the Murray River Valley of New South Wales and Victoria. It is not classified as threatened. The rufous <b>bettong</b> {{is about the size of}} a full grown rabbit.|$|R
50|$|This <b>bettong</b> is {{a solitary}} animal and is nocturnal. It spends {{the day in}} a well {{concealed}} nest constructed beneath either a tree within a clump of grass or from other litter collected at ground level. Nesting material is carried using its prehensile tail. Ectomycorrhizal fungal sporocarps are the staple diet of the northern <b>bettong.</b> These are dug from beneath the soil at the bases of trees, and work to date suggests substantial nightly movements are often required to detect this patchily distributed food source. Other foods in the diet include grass roots and tubers, lilies, herbs, and sedges. The northern <b>bettong</b> appears to breed all year round, and like other relatives of the kangaroos, the joey is carried in a pouch until it {{is old enough to}} follow the mother as a 'young-at-foot'.|$|R
50|$|The boodie {{belongs to}} the family Potoroidae, which {{includes}} the rat-kangaroos, potoroos, and other <b>bettongs.</b> Four species make up the genus Bettongia. Also, three subspecies of Bettongia lesueur exist: B. l. graii, the extinct mainland subspecies; B. l. nova, an undescribed species on Barrow and Brodie Island; and B. l. lesueur.|$|E
50|$|The Mount Lewis spiny {{crayfish}} is an endemic species. Also {{found in}} the park are golden bowerbirds, blue-faced parrotfinch, giant blue earthworms, cinereus ringtail possum, masked white-tailed rat, red-bellied black snake {{as well as several}} species or rare frogs.In February 2017 small population of endangered northern <b>bettongs</b> had been discovered in the National Park.|$|E
50|$|Earth Sanctuaries {{purchased}} the 1185-hectare Mount Rothwell property from the Chirnside family in March 2000, {{due to the}} presence of a 170-hectare remnant of old-growth grassy woodland. Long-nosed potoroos, southern brown bandicoots, rufous <b>bettongs,</b> red-bellied pademelons, eastern quolls and brush-tailed phascogales were reintroduced into their former habitat. The sanctuary opened to the public on 7 September 2002.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>bettong</b> is {{an endangered}} animal, and only populates three regions of Queensland, Australia, all within 80 miles of each other.|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{programs}} at the sanctuary include the southern cassowary, estuarine crocodile, northern <b>bettong,</b> common wombat, koala, nail-tail wallaby, eclectus parrot, and black-headed python.|$|R
