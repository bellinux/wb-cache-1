5|$|Fässler {{extended}} his lead to 13 seconds when Jani was delayed by a Porsche LMGTE car at Brooklands corner. Jani {{was able to}} reduce the time deficit to ten seconds before Fässler made a pit stop for new tyres. Jani recorded the fastest lap of the race in response, at one minute and 30.303 seconds. Jani made his pit stop for new tyres with over a minute lead with Fässler retaking the first position. After five minutes Jani's front-right tyre was punctured, necessitating an unscheduled pit stop to change the wheel, and for extra fuel. Fässler made his final scheduled pit stop for fuel to {{reach the end of}} the race and remained in the lead with a seven-second lead over Jani. Bachler suffered a front-right suspension issue on his car. Smoke <b>bellowed</b> {{out of the back of}} Richie Stanaway's Aston Martin heading into Copse corner and he retired from the event. Joël Camathias took over the LMGTE Am lead but slowed with a car problem and returned slowly to the pit lane, allowing the No. 83 AF Corse into first place. Pantanici lost sixth place in LMP2 to Merhi at the loop and Rast moved into third place in category at Copse corner. The final period of pit stops began when Bruni made a stop, followed by Filipe Albuquerque who gained the LMP2 lead from co-driver Senna earlier in the race. Jani and Kobayashi both stopped for fuel which enabled the pair to reach the end of the event.|$|E
5|$|Graves, {{who fell}} to second in class, went into Rivage's gravel trap with a left-front brake failure, {{causing him to}} retire. Toyota retired their No. 6 entry from the race because of an engine failure caused by an {{electrical}} fault. Smoke <b>bellowed</b> from the rear-end of Nakajima's Toyota upon leaving La Source and he {{went back into the}} pit lane where his mechanics worked on rectifying the problem allowing Oliver Jarvis in the No. 8 Audi to inherit the lead. Webber drove straight at the Bus Stop chicane, spun, and drove into the pit lane. Stefan Mücke, who was affected by turbocharger issues, lost control of the No. 66 Ford after one of his rear tyres was punctured, and narrowly avoided going airborne. The vehicle made heavy contact with the left-hand side barriers at Raidillon, heavily damaging the front-end and removing both of its doors, as well as littering debris onto the circuit. His car stopped in the centre of the track, causing the No. 2 Porsche to swerve to avoid hitting the vehicle, and the safety car was deployed to allow marshals to repair the heavily damaged tyre barrier. Drivers were instructed to steer onto the right-hand side of the track at Eau Rouge because the stranded car blocked the turn. Mücke was transported to the track's medical centre and later taken to the local hospital for a precautionary check-up because of bruising.|$|E
5|$|The No. 9 Audi {{began to}} fall off the race pace after {{multiple}} visits to the garage for repairs to its hybrid system, but the No. 7 Audi kept fighting as Lotterer reset the fastest lap of the race with a three minutes and 17.476 seconds time. KCMG had an anxious moment when Lapierre missed the Indianapolis corner, but recovered with marshal assistance without losing the LMP2 class lead. The No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari slowed on course {{and came to the}} garage with gearbox issues, handing the LMGTE Pro lead back to Corvette and allowing the No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari to climb to second place after recovering from its earlier issues. Vanthoor drove his car into his pitbox with gearbox problems but his team were unable to repair it before the race's conclusion and retired. Jann Mardenborough's Nissan came to a halt at the Porsche Curves after smoke <b>bellowed</b> out of {{the front of the car}} as the gearbox failed, leaving Nissan with a single car left circulating. Light rain {{began to fall}} on portions of the circuit in the final hour, but it was not heavy enough to affect the race. Dalla Lana, having led the previous 125 laps in LMGTE Am and within forty five minutes of the race finish, went straight on at the Ford Chicane and crashed heavily into an outside tyre barrier, ending the car's run and promoting the SMP Ferrari to the class lead which it held to the finish. Dalla Lana was unhurt.|$|E

25|$|One {{practice}} session lasting {{half an hour}} was held on Thursday before the two races. Leimer for Racing Engineering set a benchmark which was the fastest time in the sole {{practice session}}—held in variable weather conditions and warm track temperatures—with a lap of one minute and 41.361 seconds on the hard compound tyres, one second faster than any one else on the track. His closest challenger was Sam Bird in second in front of third-placed Coletti and Rossi in fourth position. Marcus Ericsson was fifth-fastest, ahead of Nasr. Calado was seventh-fastest, Tom Dillmann eighth, Johnny Cecotto Jr. ninth and Daniel Abt completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Frijns spun early on but recovered without needing external assistance. Smoke <b>bellowed</b> out of Cecotto's car while driving at high-speed and later locked his tyres at the first corner before overshooting into the sand. Julián Leal stalled at the exit of the pit lane and {{this led to a}} stewards investigation over whether his team's mechanics restarted the car outside of the limits of the pit lane. Leal then narrowly avoided running into the rear-end of Rossi's car.|$|E
25|$|While Rosberg was {{instructed}} to continue conserving fuel, Hamilton was told on his radio {{that he was not}} required to do the same. Rosberg was then reassured that his fuel consumption levels were back on target and began to lap faster than his teammate. Vergne caught Bianchi and made minor contact with the Marussia driver at the Loews hairpin. Leaving the tunnel, smoke <b>bellowed</b> out of the rear of Vergne's Toro Rosso but was able to limp back to the pit lane to retire on lap 52. Bottas was caught by Gutiérrez, Räikkönen and Massa – who was on fresh tyres – and Gutiérrez attacked Bottas at the Novelle chicane but Bottas kept eighth by cutting the corner. With smoke bellowing from his car on lap 55, Bottas drove {{to the side of the}} track at the Loews hairpin to retire. The need for a safety car was avoided when his car was removed from the track by a crane and yellow flags were waved in the area. Gutiérrez hit the inside guardrail at La Rascasse on lap 59, damaging the rear suspension of his Sauber and causing him to retire while running in eighth and on course for his first points of the season. This promoted Bianchi into tenth, which put him in position to score Marussia's first and only points in Formula One, but he also earned a five-second time penalty for illegally taking his earlier, five-second time penalty under the safety car.|$|E

50|$|Welded <b>bellows</b> (also called edge-welded, or {{diaphragm}} <b>bellows)</b> {{are manufactured}} by welding {{a number of}} individually formed diaphragms to each other. The comparison between the two <b>bellows</b> types generally centers on cost and performance.

However, hydroformed <b>bellows</b> have lower performance characteristics due to relatively thick walls and high stiffness.

40|$|<b>Bellows</b> is a {{metal pipe}} with stretch and flexibility. <b>Bellows</b> {{is used in}} various environments as {{expansion}} joints of piping equipment to absorb vibration and thermal expansion. 60 % of <b>bellows</b> failure is caused by fatigue and low cycle fatigue failure occurs on <b>bellows</b> because the <b>bellows</b> are used in plastic region. This study intends to elucidate the mechanical properties of the <b>bellows</b> with elasto-plastic analysis. Then manufacturing the <b>bellows,</b> the shape of <b>bellows</b> is formed by extruding {{from the inside of}} a pipe. Therefore thickness of the <b>bellows</b> is not uniform and the thickness of the crown becomes thinner than the root. Analysis models considering thickness distribution are constructed in order to elucidate the influence of the thickness distribution. As a result, maximum equivalent stress is higher in U-type than n-type. Then, number of cycle to failure of U-type is about 30 - 40 % less than fi-type, so ft-type has mechanical superiority than U-type. Also life of the <b>bellows</b> is reduced by considering the thickness distribution. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the thickness distribution in order to evaluate the life of <b>bellows</b> in safe side. ROMBUNNO. G 030050...|$|R
