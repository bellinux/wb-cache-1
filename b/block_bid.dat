Two types of bid {{scenarios}} are proposed as linear bid and <b>block</b> <b>bid</b> trading for wind power generation, but the model {{did not consider}} transmission constraints and competition {{with other types of}} generators. In [22, 23], a trading strategy is given for wind power producers to minimize their imbalance cost in short-term, but the transmission constraints as well as competition with other types of generators are not considered. In [24], the uncertainty of wind power generation was modeled in constraints of an optimization problem instead of in the objective function. However, it did not consider the wind power generation as a variable in the objective function of the optimization problem.|$|E
40|$|In {{deregulated}} power markets, power firms bid {{into the}} day-ahead power market either with buy offers or sell offers. The auction mechanism and competition determine the equilibrium price and quantity for each hour. If the bid {{price of a}} company is below the market clearing price, then the offer of the company is accepted and rewarded with the market price. A company can be a price maker or price taker depending on the capacity it offers to the market. A price-taker unit must determine the right offer that will maximize their profit given price uncertainty and blind auction rules. This paper first examines power supply in the Turkish electricity market and bidding process. Then a marginal cost-based Monte Carlo method is developed to determine hourly and <b>block</b> <b>bidding</b> strategies of price taker units. Historical market prices are then implemented in a normal distribution to generate hourly price scenarios. A solution methodology is developed that maximizes the expected profit of each hourly and <b>block</b> <b>bidding</b> strategy over price scenarios. The generator is able to both evaluate the hourly <b>bidding</b> and <b>block</b> <b>bidding</b> strategies and find the best bidding strategy that will be submitted to the market using the proposed methodology. The model is illustrated for two coal units in Turkish power market {{and the results are}} presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} a novel multi-objective optimization <b>block</b> <b>bidding</b> model for power markets, which take the minimum {{of the pool}} purchase cost and the minimum pollution emission into consideration. Firstly, two single-objective problem is solved {{and the value of}} objective function are gained, then by using fuzzy sets theory the multi-objective problem is reformulated into a new standard single-objective nonlinear programming problem by means of max-min operator, finally, the new bidding results that multi-objective optimal is gained by the queuing algorithm. To evaluate the feasibility of the transaction planning, the transient stability simulation for multi-objective optimal transaction scheduling is also investigated in this paper. The numerical results of IEEE 9 -bus 3 generator system shows the efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm. This model can get environmental/economic optimization under the system transient stability and can ensure the fairness of multi-factor of generation bidder in electricity market.

40|$|In a {{deregulated}} electricity market, generating companies aim {{to maximize}} their profit, by bidding optimally in the day-ahead market, under incomplete information of the competing generators. This paper develops an optimal bidding strategy for a thermal generator, considering a nonlinear operating cost function.

Rival bidding behavior is described using normal probability distribution function, and the optimal bidding strategy for a generation company is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem.

40|$|Calpain is a {{ubiquitous}} protease {{with potential}} involvement in apoptosis. We report that in human melanoma cells, cisplatin-induced calpain activation occurs early in apoptosis. Calpain activation and subsequent apoptosis were inhibited by calpeptin and PD 150606, two calpain inhibitors with different modes of action. Furthermore, cisplatin induced cleavage of the BH 3 -only protein Bid, yielding a 14 -kDa fragment similar to proapoptotic, caspase-cleaved Bid. However, Bid cleavage was inhibited by inhibitors of calpain, {{but not by}} inhibitors of caspases or of cathepsin L. Recombinant Bid was cleaved in vitro by both recombinant calpain and by lysates of cisplatin-treated cells. Cleavage was calpeptin sensitive, and the cleavage site was mapped between Gly 70 and Arg 71. Calpain-cleaved Bid induced cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. While calpeptin did not affect cisplatin-induced modulation of Bak to its proapoptotic conformation, a dominant-negative mutant of MEKK 1 (dnMEKK) inhibited Bak modulation. dnMEKK did not, however, <b>block</b> <b>Bid</b> cleavage. The combination of dnMEKK and calpeptin had an additive inhibitory effect on apoptosis. In summary, calpain-mediated Bid cleavage is important in drug-induced apoptosis, and cisplatin induces at least two separate apoptotic signaling pathways resulting in Bid cleavage and Bak modulation, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Ultraviolet (UV) {{irradiation}} is a DNA-damaging {{agent that}} triggers apoptosis through both the membrane death receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathways. Bid, a pro-apoptotic Bcl- 2 family member, {{is important in}} most cell types to apoptosis in response to DNA damage. In this study, a recombinant plasmid, YFP-Bid-CFP, comprised of yellow and cyan fluorescent protein and a full length Bid, {{was used as a}} fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis (FRET) probe. Using the FRET technique based on YFP-Bid-CFP, we found that Bid activation was initiated at 9 ± 1 h after UV irradiation, and the average duration of the activation was 75 ± 10 min. Bid activation coincided with a collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential with an average duration of 50 ± 10 min. When cells were pretreated with Z-IETD-fmk (caspase- 8 specific inhibitor) the process of Bid activation was completely inhibited, but the apoptosis was only partially affected. Z-DEVD-fmk (caspase- 3 inhibitor) and Z-FA-fmk (non asp specific inhibitor) did not <b>block</b> <b>Bid</b> activation. Furthermore, the endogenous Bid activation with or without Z-IETD-fmk in response to UV irradiation was confirmed by Western blotting. In summary, using the FRET technique, we observed the dynamics of Bid activation during UV-induced apoptosis and found that it was a caspase- 8 dependent event.

40|$|We {{examine the}} problem of {{clearing}} day-ahead electricity market auctions where each bidder, whether a producer or consumer, can specify a minimum profit or maximum payment condition constraining the acceptance {{of a set of}} bid curves spanning multiple time periods in locations connected through a transmission network with linear constraints. Such types of conditions are for example considered in the Spanish and Portuguese day-ahead markets. This helps describing the recovery of start-up costs of a power plant, or analogously for a large consumer, utility reduced by a constant term. A new market model is proposed with a corresponding MILP formulation for uniform locational price day-ahead auctions, handling bids with a minimum profit or maximum payment condition in a uniform and computationally-efficient way. An exact decomposition procedure with sparse strengthened Benders cuts derived from the MILP formulation is also proposed. The MILP formulation and the decomposition procedure are similar to computationally-efficient approaches previously proposed to handle so-called <b>block</b> <b>bids</b> according to European market rules, though the clearing conditions could appear different at first sight. Both solving approaches are also valid to deal with both kinds of <b>bids</b> simultaneously, as <b>block</b> <b>bids</b> with a minimum acceptance ratio, generalizing fully indivisible <b>block</b> <b>bids,</b> are but a special case of the MP bids introduced here.

40|$|Security {{and privacy}} in online auctions {{is a major}} concern as auction {{participants}} have many opportunities to cheat (e. g., repudiate bids, not deliver items, etc.). Online auctions such as those used by eBay are based on a type of auction referred to as an English auction. Despite the English auction being the most popular type of auction, it has received less security coverage than other types of auctions (e. g., sealed-bid auctions). An existing proposal for a “secure” English auction prevents the Auctioneer from closing the auction early and from <b>blocking</b> <b>bids,</b> but does not protect a bidder’s anonymity. Another proposal provides anonymity, but does not stop an Auctioneer from skewing its clock or <b>blocking</b> <b>bids.</b> This paper proposes a new scheme for conducting secure and anonymous online English auctions using a modified type of group signature. Trust is divided among three servers owned by separate companies to ensure anonymity and fairness. Our scheme solves the problems of the existing English auction schemes and has following characteristics: unforgeability, anonymity, unlinkability, exculpability, coalition-resistance, verifiability, robustness, traceability, revocation, one-off registration, unskewability and unblockability.

40|$|In this paper, we {{analytically}} compare centralized and decentralized market designs {{involving a}} {{national and local}} market operators, strategic generators having market power and bidding sequentially in local markets, to determine which design is more efficient for the procurement of energy. In the centralized design, used as benchmark, the national market operator optimizes the exchanges between local markets and the genera-tors' block bids. In the decentralized design, generators act as Stackelberg leaders, anticipating the local market prices and the flows on the transmission lines. Clearing of the local markets can be either simultaneous or sequential. The resulting two-stage game with competitive leaders that are not price takers is formulated as a bilevel mathematical programming problem which is reformulated as a Nash-Cournot game, and conditions for existence and uniqueness of market equilibrium are studied. Imperfect information is also considered, resulting {{from the lack of}} incentives from the generators to share their RES-based generations. Through a case study, we determine that the decentralized design is as efficient as the centralized one with high share of renewables, using as performance measure the Price of Anarchy, and that imperfect information has a limited impact on the efficiency of the decentralized market design. Furthermore, we check numerically that there exists an upper-limit on the <b>block</b> <b>bid</b> length maximizing the social welfare under both centralized and decentralized designs...|$|E
40|$|A major {{clinical}} problem regarding {{treatment of}} malignant tumors with anticancer drugs is inherent or acquired resistance to therapy. One {{factor contributing to}} drug resistance of cancer cells is failure to undergo apoptosis. The aim of this thesis was to investigate pro-apoptotic signaling induced by the anti-cancer drug cisplatin in order to contribute to future improvement of cisplatin-based cancer therapy. The results demonstrate the ability of cisplatin to induce at least two separate proapoptotic pathways, and to affect several cellular organelles. The ERK and the JNK pathways are the two main mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) modules of serial kinase activities stimulated by proliferative signaling {{as well as by}} cellular stress. The role of ERK in cisplatin-induced apoptosis was studied in four melanoma cell lines. ERK activation was seen 4 h after cisplatin treatment. Inhibition of the pro survival ERK pathway resulted in different responses, from sensitizing to slightly protective. The cellular response to a certain type of treatment can thus not always be predicted. Cisplatin treatment was found to elicit increased intracellular calcium levels and activation of calpain within 1 - 3 hours. Involvement of calpain in the apoptotic response was demonstrated using calpain inhibitors which blocked caspase activation and nuclear fragmentation. Moreover, the calpain inhibitor calpeptin was able to block cisplatin-induced cleavage of the proapoptotic Bid. Recombinant Bid was cleaved in vitro by recombinant calpain as well as lysates of cisplatin-treated cells. Apoptosis via the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway is known to require activation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl- 2 proteins Bak and Bax. We demonstrate the ability of cisplatin to induce activation of Bak, and suggest a kinase fragment of MEKK 1 (deltaMEKK 1) as mediator of Bak activation, since activation was inhibited in cells expressing a kinase-inactive mutant of MEKK 1 (dominant negative MEKK 1, dnMEKK 1). Involvement of deltaMEKK 1 in Bak activation was supported by the ability of a constitutively active kinase mutant of MEKK 1 (dominant positive MEKK 1, dpMEKKI 1) to activate Bak in three cell lines out of four, and to induce apoptosis in two of them. In contrast to dnMEKK 1, calpeptin did not affect Bak activation but did <b>block</b> <b>Bid</b> cleavage. On the other hand Bid cleavage was not affected by dnMEKK 1. Calpeptin and dnMEKK 1 were both able to block nuclear fragmentation and caspase activation by approximately half. When used together, they had an additive inhibitory effect on apoptosis. Using enucleated cells (cytoplasts) we demonstrated the ability of cisplatin to induce apoptosis in the absence of nuclear DNA. Cisplatin treatment of cytoplasts resulted in calpainmediated Bid cleavage as well as calcium- and calpain-dependent activation of caspase- 3. Moreover, calpeptin- sensitive activation of pro-caspase- 12 was found in cisplatin-treated cells and cytoplasts. Caspase- 12 is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is activated by ER stress. Cisplatininduced ER stress was supported by increased expression of grp 78, an ER chaperone protein. In summary, we have characterized two novel pro-apoptotic pathways induced by cisplatin and investigated the time course of their activation. One pathway is activated early and involves calciumdependent activation of calpain and calpain-mediated cleavage of Bid. The other pathway involves deltaMEKK 1 -mediated activation of Bak shortly before onset of caspase- 3. We have also identified ER as a new, non-nuclear target of cisplatin, and suggest ER stress as a potent mediator of cisplatin-induced proapoptotic signaling...|$|E

40|$|Bcl- 2 {{family member}} Bid {{is subject to}} autoinhibition; {{in the absence of}} stimuli, its N-terminal region sequesters the proapoptotic Bcl- 2 {{homology}} 3 (BH 3) domain. Upon proteolytic cleavage in its unstructured loop, Bid is activated, although structural data reveal no apparent resulting conformational change. We found that, upon Bid cleavage, the N-terminal fragment (tBid-N) is ubiquitinated and degraded, thus freeing the BH 3 domain in the C-terminal fragment (tBid-C). Ubiquitination of tBid-N is unconventional because acceptor sites are neither lysines nor the N terminus. Chemical approaches implicated thioester and hydroxyester linkage of ubiquitin and mutagenesis implicated serine and possibly threonine as acceptor residues in addition to cysteine. Acceptor sites reside predominantly but not exclusively in helix 1, which is required for ubiquitination and degradation of tBid-N. Rescue of tBid-N from degradation <b>blocked</b> <b>Bid's</b> ability to induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeability but not mitochondrial translocation of the cleaved complex.

Unlike the public procurer, the intermediary does not have the favored company and takes bribes from each company. Therefore, if the intermediary sets rather low bribe, that equalizes chances of getting the public contract for companies with different production costs. As a result, incentives for favoritism depend on the costs efficiency of the favored company. The model shows that if the favored company has high production costs, a corrupt intermediary encourages favoritism. On the contrary, if the favored company has low production costs, favoritism becomes less probable in e-auction, than in outcry auction. Hence, even if the intermediary is corrupt, e-auction may provide lower incentives to favoritism and increase social welfare...|$|R
