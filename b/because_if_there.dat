After consulting with his supervisors, he opted to publish a four-page newspaper instead of a six-page one, omitting the pages containing the two stories in question. Cutting two pages removed a total of seven articles from the paper. Reynolds did not tell the students about the decision, and they did not find out about it until the paper was delivered to the school.|$|E

Parker begins a search for answers that will lead him to a killer—or {{to the end of}} his career. <b>Because</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> one lesson Parker has learned over the years, it's that in a town built on fame and fantasy, delivering the truth can be murder.|$|R

Breast milk may contain the virus for two weeks after recovery, and transmission of the disease to a consumer of the breast milk may be possible. By October 2014 it was suspected that handling a piece of contaminated paper may be enough to contract the disease. Contamination on paper makes it harder to keep records in Ebola clinics, as data about patients written on paper that gets written down in a [...] "hot" [...] zone is hard to pass to a [...] "safe" [...] zone, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is any contamination it may bring Ebola into that area.

Godard worked with minimal equipment and a small crew, including Aragno, Godard's assistant Jean-Paul Battaggia and a [...] "young man who ensures that the actors and props don't go missing and no passersby wander into the frame." [...] All the equipment fit into a single van and included two 3D cameras, a handheld camera which Godard operated, a sound recorder and an umbrella. Godard said that he prefers working with small crews instead of larger ones [...] "as there are for American films where {{they are allowed to}} have forty people. <b>Because,</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> are fewer of them, they feel too lonely."

He writes in dialect, sets his stories in cities, talk about gangs and other contemporary issues, and produces stories that no one else is telling.

2500|$|In her writings, Du Châtelet criticizes John Locke’s philosophy. She {{emphasizes}} {{the necessity of}} the verification of knowledge through experience: Locke’s idea {{of the possibility of}} thinking matter is [...] abstruse. Her critique on Locke originates in her Bernard de Mandeville commentary [...] She confronts us with her resolute statement in favor of universal principles which precondition human knowledge and action, and maintains that this kind of law is innate. [...] Du Châtelet claims the necessity of a universal presupposition, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is no such beginning, all our knowledge is relative. In that way, Du Châtelet rejects John Locke’s aversion of innate ideas and a priori principles. She also reverses Locke’s negation of the principle of contradiction, which would constitute the basis of her methodic reflections in the Institutions. On the contrary, she affirms her arguments in favor of the necessity of a priori and universal principles. “two and two could then make as well 4 as 6” if a priori principles did not exist.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, a basic intuition that Silver {{drew from}} his {{analysis}} of the 2008 Democratic party primary elections was that the voting history of a state or Congressional district provided clues to current voting. This is what allowed him to beat all the pollsters in his forecasts in the Democratic primaries in North Carolina and Indiana, for example. Using such information allowed Silver to come up with estimates of the vote preferences even in states for which there were few if any polls. For his general election projections for each state, in addition to relying on the available polls in a given state and [...] "similar states," [...] Silver estimated a [...] "538 regression" [...] using historical voting information along with demographic characteristics of the states to create an estimate that he treated as a separate poll (equivalent to the actually available polls from that state). This approach helped to stabilize his projections, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> were few if any polls in a given state, the state forecast was largely determined by the 538 regression estimate.|$|E
2500|$|An {{immediate}} need {{in treatment}} {{is to ensure}} that the airway is open and not threatened (for example by tissues or foreign objects), because airway compromisation can occur rapidly and insidiously, and is potentially deadly. [...] Material in the mouth that threatens the airway can be removed manually or using a suction tool for that purpose, and supplemental oxygen can be provided. Facial fractures that threaten to interfere with the airway can be reduced by moving the bones back into place; this both reduces bleeding and moves the bone {{out of the way of}} the airway. Tracheal intubation (inserting a tube into the airway to assist breathing) may be difficult or impossible due to swelling. [...] Nasal intubation, inserting an endotracheal tube through the nose, may be contraindicated in the presence of facial trauma <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is an undiscovered fracture at the base of the skull, the tube could be forced through it and into the brain. [...] If facial injuries prevent oraotracheal or nasotracheal intubation, a surgical airway can be placed to provide an adequate airway. [...] Although cricothyrotomy and tracheostomy can secure an airway when other methods fail, they are used only as a last resort because of potential complications and the difficulty of the procedures.|$|E

He writes a letter for Santa Claus resulting in Santa Claus arriving at the National Archives of Denmark the next day. Without knowing the fact that Santa Claus is already there, Pyrus steals Gyldengrød's magic book and tries to bring Santa Claus to the Archives from a book about Santa Claus, resulting in a Santa Claus with amnesia. Christmas is in a big danger <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>there's</b> no Santa Claus, there are no Christmas presents, and <b>if</b> <b>there</b> are no Christmas presents, then there will be a very sad Christmas.

2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is to be meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.

5000|$|Reasons {{as to why}} {{the game}} never got {{released}} are difficult to come up with. It definitely was not due to the game being unfinished. This game was complete enough to be reviewed by Nintendo Power, to be rated by the ESRB and have its own box art and UPC, and {{was in the process of}} being approved by Nintendo as of February 2001. The possibility of Nintendo not liking what they saw when approving it also seems incredibly unlikely.
