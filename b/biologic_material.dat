40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{determination}} of nitrogen in <b>biologic</b> <b>material</b> is described. It is basedon an improvedashingprocedureand the Berthelot reactton in which nitrogen is converted to indophenol. The concentration of this substance is determined photo-metrically. The proposedmethod yields the same results as the Keldahi procedure; however, it offers {{a higher degree of}} sensitivity combined with the same degree of accuracy. In addition, the determination requires only 4 hr., in comparisonto 24 hr. for the Kjeldahl method. CURRENT METHODS for nitrogen determination in <b>biologic</b> <b>material</b> are based on a two-step principle: The organic substance is ashed in the presence of sulfuric acid, and nitrogen is converted to ammonium sulfate. Ammonia is then liberated and measured either titrimetrically or photometrically. In the Kjeldahl procedure (1) ammonia is back titrated with sulfuric acid after steam distillation. The method is tedious and inaccurate. Modifications promising a higher sensitivity are very time-consuming and laborious (2). In theory, the photometric nitrogen determination based on Nessler’s principle (3) is more satisfactory, but requires a pure solution of ammonia (4). This involves a time-consuming microdiffusion. Turbidi-ties appearing even in the working range may interfere with the photo-metric reading (2, 5). With the above difficulties in mind the present method was worked out. It is based on the principle of Berthelot (6) as applied by Mann (7), with introduction of an improved digestion procedure...|$|E

40|$|A method {{previously}} described {{for the total}} automation of nitrogen measurements from solid <b>biologic</b> <b>material</b> has been adapted for automating nitrogen recovery from urine following micro-Kjeldahl digestion.

Comparative studies with the Markham (1) procedure revealed mean nitrogen recoveries for the automated method of 106 %. The cause of the 6 % difference remains unexplained, but cannot be attributed to low recovery by the Markham method. Application of a “correction factor ” of 6 % to the measurements by the automated method gave recoveries for urinary nitrogen almost identical with those obtained by the Markham method. Time studies were compared on the two methods. When the number of urine samples to be analyzed exceeded 14 per day, the automated method was time-saving, reliable, and convenient.

40|$|Introduction: Various grafts {{have been}} used in the {{treatment}} of urinary incontinence and pelvic prolapse. Autologous materials such as muscle and fascia were first utilized to provide additional anatomic support to the periurethral and pelvic tissues; however, attempts to minimize the invasiveness of the procedures have led to the use of synthetic materials. Complications such as infection and erosion or extrusion associated with these materials may be troublesome to manage. We review the literature and describe a brief overview of grafts used in pelvic floor reconstruction and focus on the management complications specifically related to synthetic materials. Materials and Methods: We performed a comprehensive review of the literature on grafts used in pelvic floor surgery using MEDLINE and resources cited in those peer-reviewed manuscripts. The results are presented. Results: <b>Biologic</b> <b>materials</b> provide adequate cure rates but have associated downfalls including potential complications from harvesting, variable tissue quality and cost. The use of synthetic materials as an alternative graft in pelvic floor repairs has become a popular option. Of all synthetic materials, the type I macroporous polypropylene meshes have demonstrated superiority in terms of efficacy and fewer complication rates due to their structure and composition. Erosion and extrusion of mesh are common and troublesome complications that may be managed conservatively with observation with or without local hormone therapy, with transvaginal debridement or with surgical exploration and total mesh excision, dependent upon the location of the mesh and the mesh type utilized. Conclusions: The ideal graft would provide structural integrity and durability with minimal adverse reaction by the host tissue. <b>Biologic</b> <b>materials</b> in general tend to have fewer associated complications, however, the risks of harvesting, variable integrity of allografts, availability and high cost has led to the development and use of synthetic grafts.
