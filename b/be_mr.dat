500|$|Mr. Burns {{remained}} largely ignorant of Smithers' devoted adoration, much to Smithers' frustration.

500|$|Boyd van Hoeij of Variety {{magazine}} was more critical, writing [...] "Though {{a lot of}} it is well written and directed and, quite often, funny or poignant, the individual scenes rarely become part of a larger whole." [...] He praises Leto's acting, stating [...] "The closest the film comes to having a gravitational center are in the scenes set in 2092. What makes them soar is not the imaginative staging of the future, but Leto's performance. His acting talent really comes into full view in his scenes as the last dying man on Earth." [...] He also praised Regbo and Temple, saying [...] "Regbo, as the teenage Nemo, and Juno Temple, as the teenage Anna, are impressive, bringing the hormonal battles of adolescence vividly to life." [...] Film critic Eric Lavallée listed Regbo as one of his [...] "Top 10 New Faces & Voices" [...] of 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. He notes that [...] "newbie Toby Regbo might easily <b>be</b> <b>Mr.</b> Nobody's most [...] "alive" [...] character. Playing Nemo at age 16, the actor is mostly paired with Juno Temple – their unique love story is the film's heart pumping portions and plays a lot better than the artery clogging other brushes of romance." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Mr. Rogers {{had been}} long and straitly imprisoned, and lodged in Newgate among thieves, often examined, and very uncharitably entreated, and at length {{unjustly}} and most cruelly condemned by Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, the fourth day of February, {{in the year of}} our Lord 1555, being Monday in the morning, he was suddenly warned by the keeper of Newgate's wife, to prepare himself for the fire; who, being then sound asleep, could scarce be awaked.

Meanwhile, other fronts of the war were progressing rapidly, and the Germans were hard-pressed. It was necessary to discuss the future shape of Yugoslavia at the highest possible level, and so Maclean was instructed to invite Tito and his entourage to Caserta, the Allied Force Headquarters near Naples. Maclean accompanied him on this, his first public appearance outside his own country. While the negotiations wore on, Maclean was told that Churchill would be in Italy in a week and wanted to see the Yugoslav Marshal, but security meant the prime minister's movements could not be released. [...] Maclean helped to spin out Tito's visit with side trips and excuses, taking him to Rome and Cassino, [...] "to tea with Hermione Ranfurly at her ridiculous little house of the side of the hill overlooking the Bay of Naples" [...] and to Capri to meet Mrs Harrison Williams. Sitting outside one afternoon, Tito saw a heavy plane and a dozen fighters coming in, and announced that that must <b>be</b> <b>Mr</b> Churchill.
