In this article we derive the asymptotic covariance of three estimators for multivariate ROC models. These covariance estimates have not been readily available in the literature, and bootstrap methods have {{to be used to}} obtain co- variance estimates. With the readily available variance estimates, we can easily perform hypothesis testing among ROC curves while bootstrap tests are not so easily performed. The asymptotic results are applied to compare ROC curves and their areas under ROC curves. Moreover, we derive simultaneous confidence bands for multivariate ROC curves. We evaluate and compare the finite sample performance of our asymptotic covariance estimators. We also discuss the ad- vantage of using our asymptotic results over bootstrap procedures.

40|$|AbstractAlthough it is {{currently}} recognized that bronchial asthma {{is not a single}} disease but a syndrome, we have not yet made use of our new understanding of this heterogeneity as we treat asthma patients. To increase the efficacy of anti-asthma drugs and to decrease costs, it is important to stratify asthma patients into subgroups and to develop therapeutic strategies for each subgroup. Periostin has recently emerged as a biomarker for bronchial asthma, unique in that it is useful not in diagnosis but in categorizing asthma patients. We first found that periostin is a novel component of subepithelial fibrosis in bronchial asthma downstream of IL- 13 signals. Thereafter, it was shown that periostin can be a surrogate <b>biomarker</b> of <b>type</b> 2 immune responses, the basis of the notion that a detection system of serum periostin is potentially a companion diagnostic for type 2 antagonists. Furthermore, we have recently shown that serum periostin can predict resistance or hyporesponsiveness to inhaled corticosteroids, based on its contribution to tissue remodeling or fibrosis in bronchial asthma. Thus, serum periostin has two characteristics as a biomarker for bronchial asthma: it is both a surrogate <b>biomarker</b> of <b>type</b> 2 immune responses and a biomarker reflecting tissue remodeling or fibrosis. We can take advantage of these characteristics to develop stratified medicine in bronchial asthma...|$|R

This thesis explores the role of microRNAs in human cancer cachexia and Type 2 diabetes. MicroRNA expression was measured in skeletal muscle biopsies using RT-qPCR. In pancreatic cancer cachexia patients, expression of microRNA- 1, microRNA- 133 a, microRNA- 133 b and microRNA- 206 was negatively related to weight loss. In Type 2 diabetes skeletal muscle, microRNA- 133 a and microRNA- 206 expression was down-regulated, {{but there was no}} evidence of altered microRNA transcription or processing and target expression was unchanged. Importantly, microRNA- 133 a expression predicted fasting glucose, glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, and therefore may be a <b>biomarker</b> of <b>Type</b> 2 diabetes. Experimental validation of microRNA arrays was unsuccessful in identifying further novel cancer cachexia and Type 2 diabetes microRNA biomarkers. MicroRNA knockdown validated CDC 42 and PTBP 1 as microRNA- 133 a targets in myoblasts. In addition, muscle microRNA expression may be regulated by insulin and TNFa. In conclusion, microRNA- 133 a may be a skeletal muscle <b>biomarker</b> of <b>Type</b> 2 diabetes and cancer cachexia, microRNA- 133 a responds to extracellular insulin and TNFa, but it remains to be established whether microRNA- 133 a contributes to cancer cachexia or Type 2 diabetes pathogenesis.

Methods In the Maastricht Study, 712 subjects underwent assessment of NA, SI and Type D personality (DS 14), depressive disorder (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire- 9). Plasma biomarkers of inflammation (hsCRP, SAA, sICAM- 1, IL- 6, IL- 8, TNF-α) and endothelial dysfunction (sVCAM- 1, sICAM- 1, E-selectin, vWF) were measured with sandwich immunoassays or ELISA and combined into standardized sumscores. Results Regarding personality, 49 % of the study population was low in NA and SI, 22 % had SI only, 12 % NA only and 17 % had Type D. Depressive disorder and depressive symptoms were significantly more prevalent in Type D versus the other three personality subgroups. Multivariable regression analyses showed that Type D was associated with inflammation (β= 0. 228, p= 0. 014) and endothelial dysfunction (β= 0. 216, p= 0. 022).

We have conducted four expeditions to Icelandic Mars analogue sites in which an increasingly refined battery of physicochemical measurements and biomarker assays were performed, staggered with scouting of further sites. Completed expeditions took place in 2012 (location scouting and field assay use testing), 2013 (sampling of two major sites with three assays and observational physicochemical measurements), 2015 (repeat sampling of prior sites and one new site, scouting of new sites, three assays and three instruments), and 2016 (preliminary sampling of new sites with analysis of returned samples). Target sites were geologically recent basaltic lava flows, and sample loci were arranged in hierarchically nested grids at 10 cm, 1 m, 10 m, 100 m, and > 1 km order scales, subject to field constraints. Assays were intended to represent a diversity of potential <b>biomarker</b> <b>types</b> (cell counting via nucleic acid staining and fluorescence microscopy, ATP quantification via luciferase luminescence, and relative DNA quantification with simple domain-level primers) rather a specific mission science target, and were selected to reduce laboratory overhead, require limited consumables, and allow rapid turnaround.

Methods We did a pooled analysis of new, harmonised, individual-level analyses for the biomarkers linoleic acid and its metabolite arachidonic acid and incident type 2 diabetes. We analysed data from 20 prospective cohort studies from ten countries (Iceland, the Netherlands, the USA, Taiwan, the UK, Germany, Finland, Australia, Sweden, and France), with biomarkers sampled between 1970 and 2010. Participants included in the analyses were aged 18 years or older and had data available for linoleic acid and arachidonic acid biomarkers at baseline. We excluded participants with type 2 diabetes at baseline. The main outcome was the association between omega- 6 PUFA <b>biomarkers</b> and incident <b>type</b> 2 diabetes. We assessed the relative risk of type 2 diabetes prospectively for each cohort and lipid compartment separately using a prespecified analytic plan for exposures, covariates, effect modifiers, and analysis, and the findings were then pooled using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis. Findings Participants were 39   740 adults, aged (range of cohort means) 49 – 76 years with a BMI (range of cohort means) of 23 · 3 – 28 · 4 kg/m 2, {{who did not have}} type 2 diabetes at baseline. During a follow-up of 366   073 person-years, we identified 4347 cases of incident type 2 diabetes. In multivariable-adjusted pooled analyses, higher proportions of linoleic acid biomarkers as percentages of total fatty acid were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes overall (risk ratio [RR] per interquintile range 0 · 65, 95 % CI 0 · 60 – 0 · 72, p< 0 · 0001; I 2 = 53 · 9 %, pheterogeneity= 0 · 002). The associations between linoleic acid <b>biomarkers</b> and <b>type</b> 2 diabetes were generally similar in different lipid compartments, including phospholipids, plasma, cholesterol esters, and adipose tissue.

Data extraction included (a) general characteristics of the study (clinical setting, period, and study design), (b) study/participant characteristics (inclusion and exclusion criteria, race/ethnicity, number of participants, gestational age at sampling, (c) characteristics of the <b>biomarker</b> (<b>type,</b> rationale for its selection, type of biological sample, and assay used, and (d) concentration of biomarkers in cases and controls. Data collection and analysis: the search yielded 7255 citations and data were extracted from 217 articles which met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Main results: A total of 116 different biomarkers were reported and these were assayed 578 times in the 217 included studies. Over {{two thirds of the}} 217 studies were performed on North American or European populations. No reliable biomarkers emerged as a risk predictor of PTB. Conclusions: Identifying similar studies on biomarkers for the prediction of PTB was a very challenging task due heterogeneities in study design, sampling issues (types, timing and processing), assay methods, and analyses. Major areas of concern identified in this review include poor phenotype definition, nonideal study designs and poor rationale for biomarker selection and assays and population stratification issues.

40|$|The complex organic {{chemistry}} on going at Titan makes {{it one of}} the most fascinating objects in the Solar System. Studying the chemical processes that occur on Titan can improve our understanding of processes that may have occurred on an early Earth as simple molecules formed ever more complex organics leading to the eventual development of life. Cassini measurements [5] have shown that organic molecules with a mass > 10 000 Da. are produced in the upper atmosphere of Titan due to photolysis and cause the distinctive orange-brown haze associated with Titan’s atmosphere. Terrestrial analogues of Titan organic material have been produced by cold plasma discharge in a nitrogen-methane mixture. Analyses of these tholins have shown that their composition is dependent upon the chemical conditions under which they formed. Hydrolysis of tholins can produce significant quantities of amino acids [1]. A key question for Titan would be whether hydrolysis has occurred, the type of compounds formed and comparing with work carried out on Earth [3]. A Titan chemistry instrument will have to cope with a wide range of materials and should be comparable with techniques used in terrestrial labs so that direct comparison can be made with synthetically produced samples. The proposed Titan chemical analyser uses the powerful technique of GC x GC MS where the sample is separated into individual compounds and then analysed by a high resolution (M/M > 10 000) mass spectrometer. A repeat analysis can then be used to target individual components which are diverted to a separate mass spectrometer for accurate isotopic analysis. Pyrolysis and/or chemical techniques will be required to prepare the samples for analysis and to process the GC elutant for isotopic analysis, similar to that already used on the Ptolemy instrument [2]. Since chemical techniques are already incorporated it is possible to add an ExoMars <b>biomarker</b> <b>type</b> experiment which can be used to detect specific target molecules [4]. Both Montgolfière and lake landers are suitable platforms for the proposed Titan chemical analysers. A Montgolfière allows a range of atmospheric locations to be analysed over a long duration and would concentrate on the aerosol particles. Isotope analysis would help determine the origin of the initial components. Surface material will consist of loose particles that can be readily grabbed. A lake lander can detect any further chemistry occurring in a liquid environment. Of particular interest would be any sediment occurring at the liquid/solid interface. ...|$|R
40|$|Palaeoecological and {{palaeoclimate}} reconstruction, using leaf wax biomarkers, is {{a relatively}} new sub-discipline of peatland science. The ability to process large numbers of samples rapidly for <b>biomarkers</b> makes this <b>type</b> of analysis particularly appealing. This review is a guide to the preparation of leaf waxes for analysis by gas chromatography. The main phases of preparation are extraction of soluble organic compounds from sediment, separation of the total extract into fractions of differing polarity, and the derivatisation of polar functional groups. The procedures described here are not meant be exhaustive of all organic geochemical possibilities in peatlands, but a distillation of methods for the preparation of leaf waxes that are commonly and increasingly being used in palaeoecological and palaeoclimatological studies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The altered {{expression}} of microRNAs (miRNAs) {{is associated with}} a number of cancer types. The study of the association between the miRNA profile and cancer may be useful to identify potential <b>biomarkers</b> of certain <b>types</b> of cancer. In the present study, 19 miRNAs were identified by high-throughput sequencing in the serum of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. A network analysis was performed based on a computational approach to identify associations between CRC and miRNAs. The present study may be useful to identify cancer‑specific signatures and potentially useful biomarkers for the diagnosis of CRC. The network analysis of miRNA-target genes may aid in identifying altered miRNA regulatory networks that are involved in tumor pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as {{the most}} common form of dementia, has for many years {{attracted}} the attention of researchers around the world, primarily because of the problems of reliable diagnostic methods that could help in the early detection of this devastating disease. One of the important aspects of genetic research related to AD is the analysis of chromosome instability which includes: aneuploidies of different chromosomes, telomere shortening and the phenomenon of premature centromere division (PCD). The aim of this study was to describe specific <b>biomarkers</b> in different <b>types</b> of cells as potential parameters for the diagnosis of AD in order to promptly recognize pre-symptomatic stages and prevent the development of disease and/or slow down its progression...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Soluble ST 2, {{a member}} of the of the Toll/IL- 1 superfamily, is a novel {{biomarker}} with exceptional predictive value in heart failure and myocardial infarction- related mortality as well as in acute dyspneic states. Soluble ST 2 is considered a decoy receptor of IL 33 that blocks the protective effects of the cytokine in atherosclerosis and cardiac remodeling. In the present study we investigated the differences in the levels of soluble ST 2, BNP and hs-CRP between healthy controls and patients with type 2 diabetes with and without left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. A secondary aim was to investigate correlations between sST 2 and other <b>biomarkers</b> of <b>type</b> 2 diabetes, such as HbA 1 c. Methods 158 volunteers were recruited and underwent a complete Doppler-echocardiographic evaluation of both systolic & diastolic cardiac function. All subjects with ejection fraction Results Patients with type 2 diabetes with (p Conclusions Patients with type 2 diabetes exhibit higher sST 2 levels compared to healthy controls. The presence of LVDD in patients with type 2 diabetes is associated with even higher sST 2 levels. A significant correlation between glycemic control and sST 2 levels was also revealed. </p...|$|R
