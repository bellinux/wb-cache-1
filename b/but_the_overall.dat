5|$|As older {{generation}} of Waffen-SS scribes has died off, a new, post-war cadre of writers has {{done much to}} perpetuate {{the image of the}} force as a revolutionary European army. The degree of admiration and acceptance varies, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> tendency to accentuate the positive lives on, or has indeed grown stronger.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} regions, the locally dominant Fulani ethnic group is mostly Muslim, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> population is fairly evenly divided among Muslims, Christians, and followers of indigenous religious beliefs (called Kirdi ("pagan") by the Fulani). The Bamum ethnic {{group of the}} West Region is largely Muslim. Native traditional religions are practiced in rural areas throughout the country but rarely are practiced publicly in cities, in part because many indigenous religious groups are intrinsically local in character.|$|E
5|$|Slow-tight {{inhibition}} {{occurs when}} the initial enzyme–inhibitor complex EI undergoes isomerisation to a second more tightly held complex, EI*, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> inhibition process is reversible. This manifests itself as slowly increasing enzyme inhibition. Under these conditions, traditional Michaelis–Menten kinetics give a false value for Ki, which is time–dependent. The true value of Ki can be obtained through more complex analysis of the on (kon) and off (koff) rate constants for inhibitor association. See irreversible inhibition below for more information.|$|E

5|$|Changes {{were made}} for the third season, with the {{introduction}} of the season long Xindi storyline. This improved the reviews that the series was receiving, and the viewers in the 18 to 35 demographics <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> ratings continued to decrease. UPN cut the 26 episode order for the third season to 24, meaning that if 24 episodes were created for the fourth season as well then they would have the 100 episodes needed for syndication. As well as a move to Friday nights, the fourth season was shortened further to 22 episodes, meaning that at cancellation there were 98 episodes produced in total. At the time of cancellation, Enterprise remained the highest rated drama series on UPN. The series went immediately into broadcast syndication; the arrangements having been made by UPN prior to the cancellation. It is distributed by CBS Television Distribution.|$|E
5|$|On August3, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} depression located {{to the southeast}} of Minami Torishima Island. The depression slowly developed as it moved towards the west-northwest. At 1630UTC on August5, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the developing system while it was located about 740km (460mi) east-northeast of the northern Mariana Islands. Deep convection was present around the center of circulation <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> structure of the storm resembled a subtropical cyclone. However, the storm was likely to intensify as it was located within an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear with favorable diffulence aloft. Later that day, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Maria; a name submitted by the United States and a common Chamorro feminine name. Maria continued towards the west-northwest {{along the edge of}} a broad subtropical ridge located east of Japan.|$|E
5|$|The company faced a {{difficult}} situation again in 1967 when {{the total number of}} vehicles produced was just 381 units. At the beginning of 1968 VAT fired 40 of the 400 employees. Vanaja had its staunch customer base and the vehicles were generally well regarded <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> market share remained low; in 1963 just 4–5% of the newly registered heavy lorries in Finland were Vanajas. The highly customised production had led to an excessive diversity of models, which made spare part supply difficult. Moreover, the customising presumably took resources away from technical development work. There was no change for the better although the company introduced its modern forward control model B6-76 which was expected to become the next volume model.|$|E

5000|$|Bullpup design: {{pistol grip}} and trigger are located {{forward of the}} barrel breech and action assembly. This allows for the same barrel length as a {{traditional}} shotgun <b>but</b> shortens <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> length of <b>the</b> weapon.|$|R
5|$|The game spans six levels, each lasting {{about five}} minutes, {{with a variety}} of boss battles. Over the course of the game, the plot is {{revealed}} through cutscenes using the game's own graphic engine. Gameplay consists of a player controlling a flying dragon and his rider through an aiming reticle that can be moved over the whole screen with the D-pad; the player must shoot a variety of enemies (ranging from machines to monsters) in a 3D post-apocalyptic fantasy environment of barren landscapes and mysterious ruins of a fallen civilization. Progression through the levels is made at a predetermined pace, as the player is constantly set along a rail of gameplay. The only time the game pauses is during boss battles. The field of vision can be directed with the aiming reticle on the x and y-axis, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> direction of travel is predetermined. The dragon follows the reticle movements, allowing the player to avoid enemy projectiles and obstacles.|$|E
5|$|The hoard was {{concentrated}} {{in a single}} location, within the completely decayed remains of a wooden chest. The objects had been grouped within the chest; for example, pieces such as ladles and bowls were stacked inside each other, and other items were grouped in a way consistent with being held within an inner box. Some items had been disturbed by burrowing animals and ploughing, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> amount of disturbance was low. It was possible to determine the original layout of the artefacts within the container, {{and the existence of}} the container itself, due to Lawes' prompt notification of the find, which allowed it to be excavated in situ by professional archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} taxes levied on oil {{production}} in Alaska has changed several times since 1977, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> form remains mostly the same. Alaska receives royalties from oil production on state land. The state {{also has a}} property tax on oil production structures and transportation (pipeline) property—the only state property tax in Alaska. There is a special corporate income tax on petroleum companies, and the state taxes the amount of petroleum produced. This production tax is levied {{on the cost of}} oil at Pump Station 1. To calculate this tax, the state takes the market value of the oil, subtracts transportation costs (tanker and pipeline tariffs), subtracts production costs, then multiplies the resulting amount per barrel of oil produced each month. The state then takes a percentage of the dollar figure produced.|$|E
5000|$|...The tournament {{originally}} {{began in}} 1948 {{and has had}} a number of different names. The tournament was renamed as the UEFA European U-19 Championship in 2002, <b>but</b> importantly <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> statistics are collated from 1948.|$|R
50|$|The toilets were {{previously}} located on <b>the</b> platform, <b>but</b> during <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> renovations of <b>the</b> station they {{were moved to}} the upper level, inside the ticket gates. At the same time, a multi-purpose toilet was added.|$|R

5|$|Overall, {{the relief}} is in {{excellent}} condition. It was originally received in three pieces and some fragments by the British Museum; after repair, some cracks are still apparent, in particular a triangular piece missing {{on the right}} edge, but the main features of the deity and the animals are intact. The figure's face has damage to its left side, {{the left side of}} the nose and the neck region. The headdress has some damage to its front and right hand side, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> shape can be inferred from symmetry. Half of the necklace is missing and the symbol of the figure held in her right hand; the owls' beaks are lost and a piece of a lion's tail. A comparison of images from 1936 and 2005 shows that some modern damage has been sustained as well: the right hand side of the crown has now lost its top tier, and at the lower left corner a piece of the mountain patterning has chipped off and the owl has lost its right-side toes. However, in all major aspects, the relief has survived intact for more than 3,500years.|$|E

50|$|Harrison's Reports {{gave the}} picture a lukewarm review. They enjoyed the {{background}} story, {{as well as}} <b>the</b> action sequences, <b>but</b> felt <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> plot was routine. They gave good marks to Ruth Roman and Akim Tamiroff for their performances.|$|R

50|$|Brockovich {{had a more}} {{extensive}} role in the 2012 documentary Last Call at the Oasis, which focused on not only water pollution <b>but</b> also <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> state of water scarcity {{as it relates to}} water policy in the United States.|$|R
25|$|Lontano (1967), {{for full}} orchestra, {{is another example}} of micropolyphony, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> effect is closer to harmony, with complex woven textures and opacity of the sound giving rise to a {{harmonious}} effect. It has become a standard repertoire piece.|$|E
25|$|Brunnian links can be {{understood}} in algebraic topology via Massey products: a Massey product is an n-fold product which is only defined if all (n1)-fold products of its terms vanish. This corresponds to the Brunnian property of all (n1)-component sublinks being unlinked, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> n-component link being non-trivially linked.|$|E
25|$|The Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex {{contains}} another {{cluster of}} cultural sites at the Fort Worth Cultural District. It {{is not only}} home to five museums such as the Kimbell Art Museum, National Cowgirl Museum and the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> park-like setting also contains the local performing arts centers like symphony, ballet and theater.|$|E

25|$|Delays in {{the advance}} {{continued}} after the landing. The cavalry encountered an unexpected stronghold at Baylor's farm northeast of Petersburg. Hinks's men launched two {{attacks on the}} Confederates and captured a cannon, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> advance was delayed until early afternoon. Smith performed a reconnaissance and, despite his sense of nervousness about {{the strength of the}} enemy position, planned to carry the defensive works with a strong skirmish line. He was delayed again when his artillery commander allowed all of the horses to be watered simultaneously, making it impossible to bring up his guns until about 7 p.m.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the increasingly diverse population, several states (WA, CA, CT, NJ, NM) have passed legislation requiring or strongly recommending cultural competency training for physicians. In 2005, New Jersey legislature enacted a law requiring all physicians to complete at least 6 hours of training in cultural competency {{as a condition for}} renewal of their New Jersey medical license, whether or not they actively practice in New Jersey. Physicians' responses to this CME requirement varied, both positively and negatively. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> feedback was positive towards the outcomes of participation in and satisfaction with the programs.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of guns in the bows of galleys, a permanent wooden structure called rambade (French: rambade; Italian: rambata; Spanish: arrumbada) was introduced. The rambade became standard on virtually all galleys in the early 16th century. There were some variations in the navies of different Mediterranean powers, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> layout was the same. The forward-aiming battery was covered by a wooden platform which gave gunners a minimum of protection, and functioned as both a staging area for boarding attacks and as a firing platform for on-board soldiers. After its introduction, the rambade became a standard detail on every fighting galley {{until the very end}} of galley era in the early 19th century.|$|E
