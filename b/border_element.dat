5000|$|The {{history of}} SBCs shows that several {{corporations}} {{were involved in}} creating and popularizing the SBC market segment for carriers and enterprises. The original carrier-oriented SBC companies are (or were, since several have been acquired or are defunct): Acme Packet (acquired in 2013 by Oracle Corporation), Cisco Systems, Kagoor Networks (acquired in 2005 by Juniper Networks now offering a router-integrated solution), Jasomi Networks (acquired in 2005 by Ditech Communications, now known as Ditech Networks), Netrake (acquired in 2006 by Audiocodes), Newport Networks (now out of business), NexTone (first merged with Reef Point to form Nextpoint, and later purchased by Genband), Aravox (acquired in 2003 by Alcatel and terminated) and Emergent Network Solutions (acquired in 2006 by Stratus Technologies and in 2009 spun off as Stratus Telecommunications), Sonus Networks, Patton Electronics, Veraz Networks merging in 2010 with Dialogic to Dialogic Corporation, Cirpack, Data Connection renamed to Metaswitch in 2009, and Nable Communications. According to Jonathan Rosenberg, the author of RFC 3261 (SIP) and numerous other related RFCs, Dynamicsoft actually developed the first working SBC in conjunction with Aravox, but the product never truly gained marketshare[...]Newport Networks {{was the first to}} have an IPO on the London Stock Exchange's AIM in May 2004 (NNG), while Cisco has been publicly traded since 1990. Acme Packet followed in October 2006 by floating on the NASDAQ. With the field narrowed by acquisition, NexTone merged with Reefpoint becoming Nextpoint, which was subsequently acquired in 2008 by Genband. At this same time, there emerged the “integrated” SBC where the border control function was integrated into another edge device. Currently, both Cisco's CUBE (Cisco Unified <b>Border</b> <b>Element)</b> Enterprise and Oracle ACME are the leading enterprise SBCs in the market as per Infonetics Research.|$|E
40|$|Hypersensitive site 5 (5 ′HS 5) of the β-globin Locus Control Region {{functions}} as a developmental stage-specific border in erythroid cells. Here, we have analyzed the role of 5 ′HS 5 in the three dimensional organization of the β-gene locus using the Chromatin Conformation Capture (3 C) technique. The results show that when 5 ′HS 5 is deleted from the locus, both remote and internal regulatory elements are still able to {{interact with each other}} in a three-dimensional configuration termed the Active Chromatin Hub. Thus, the absence of 5 ′HS 5 does not have an appreciable effect on the three dimensional organization of the β-globin locus. This rules out models in which 5 ′HS 5 nucleates interactions with remote and/or internal regulatory elements. We also determined the binding of CTCF, the only defined insulator protein in mammalian cells, to 5 ′HS 5 by using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. We detect low levels of CTCF binding to 5 ′HS 5 in primitive erythroid cells, in which it {{functions as}} a <b>border</b> <b>element.</b> Surprisingly, we also observe binding levels of CTCF to 5 ′HS 5 in definitive erythroid cells. Thus, binding of CTCF to 5 ′HS 5 per se does not render it a functional <b>border</b> <b>element.</b> This is consistent with the previous data suggesting that CTCF has dual functionality...|$|E

Our results suggest that the activity of <b>bordering</b> <b>elements</b> is most pronounced for the abundant class of loci with a low but negligible expression potential in the case of highly expressed sites. By the RMCE procedure, we demonstrate that expression parameters are not due to a potential targeting action of <b>bordering</b> <b>elements,</b> in the sense that a linked transgene is directed into a special class of loci.

Motivácia vychádza zo stále sa rozširujúceho využitia bezdrátových senzorických sietí, potreby zberu dát z nich a ich integrácie. To vyžaduje aby sieť obsahovala prvky schopné preniesť dáta z bezdrátovej siete do okolitého sveta a prípadne poskytnúť konfiguračné a riadiace informácie do vnútra siete. Z hľadiska protokolov a programového vybavenia sa prepojenie uskutočňuje na rôznej úrovni, od sieťovej až po aplikačnú vrstvu komunikačného modelu ISO/OSI, s podporou hardvéru na fyzickej a linkovej vrstve. This work {{is devoted}} to the problem of {{interconnection}} of different network types, specifically IEEE 802. 15. 4 and Ethernet networks. Motivation for implementing such an interconnection arises from increased use of WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks) penetrating many of today's segments of human activity. Deployment of WSNs stems out of the need of controlling and/or monitoring of environment this network is attached to. This usually implies the existence of some kind of Gateway nodes capable of relaying of measured data from inside of the WSN to the outside world and/or providing configuration information and control commands to the WSN. A Gateway usually accomplishes this by interconnecting the WSN with other types of networks acting as a <b>border</b> <b>element.</b> There are different types of Gateways with different capabilities regarding to the network operation, all dependent on a particular network in use. On the software part the interconnection may be done from Network up to Application layer of the ISO/OSI model. Hardware interfaces Physical and Data-Link layers and of course has to be capable of running interfacing software (which may be rather complex). So there is always balance between the system complexity and sufficient capabilities. ...|$|E

Uppsala 2012. 372 pp. ISBN 978 - 91 - 7678 - 816 - 5. The study {{deals with}} the methods for {{elimination}} of double taxation that are applied in double tax treaties. The first aim {{of the study is}} to systematise and analyse the methods for elimination of double taxation under double tax treaties in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of how they work. A number of issues relating to the application of these methods are analysed. Since double tax treaties are applied by tax authorities, courts, and taxpayers in a domestic law context, i. e. within the framework of the legal system of a particular state, the analysis focuses on the application in Sweden of the methods for elimination of double taxation under double tax treaties. The second aim of the study is to evaluate in a few selected situations the two main methods for elimination of double taxation recommended by the OECD, namely exemption with progression and ordinary credit, on the basis of whether tax neutrality is achieved. For the purpose of this study, tax neutrality is deemed to be achieved when the taxation of income relating to a cross border transaction corresponds to the tax that would have been levied in either the state of residence (i. e. capital export neutrality, “CEN”) or in the other contracting state (i. e. capital import neutrality, “CIN”), had the cross <b>border</b> <b>element</b> not been present. Furthermore, for the purpose of this study, tax neutrality is deemed to be achieved if the taxation of income relating to a cross border transaction is within the range set by CEN and CIN. The evaluation shows that ordinary credit stands a greater chance than exemption with progression of achieving an outcome which is consistent with the goal of tax neutrality in the situations selected for study...|$|E

On April 26 th, 2008 Latvian Parliament {{adopted the}} {{amendments}} of the Commercial Law, allowing {{limited liability company}} registred in Latvia to merge with another limited liability company established in accordance with regulatory enactments of the European Union Member States. These amendments of Commercial Law were based on directive 2005 / 56 /EC on cross-border mergers adopted by the Council of the European Union on October 26 th, 2005. The goal of this thesis is to explore the transpositon of the directive 2005 / 56 /EC into Commercial Law. In {{the beginning of the}} thesis, the author offers to analyze two events which promoted the cross border merger of limited liability companies - the judgment of the European Union Court of Justice of December 13 th, 2005 (case SEVIC System AG) and the directive 2005 / 56 /EC. The first event allows to study cross border reorganization process in a context of freedom of establishment. The harmonization process of national rules in EU member states is the second event to be viewed. Since the cross border merger process contains cross <b>border</b> <b>element,</b> the determination of the nationality of companies participating in the cross border reorganization is a significant question {{in the context of the}} conflict of laws. Nationality of the companies can be determined by the reference to the statutory seat or real seat theories. Because of the fact that the cross border merger subjects are companies registered in the different European Union member states, the author of this thesis clarifies applicable laws to the merger process. Cross border merger influences creditors’, minority shareholders’ and employees’ interests. As the national legislators are required to ensure appropriate protection of those interests, the thesis analyzes whether Latvian legislator has reached the balance between the interests of the subjects and companies’ rights to implement the cross border merger. Cross border merger process consists of four main steps: Firstly, the management of each of the merging companies shall draw up the common draft terms of cross-border merger known as reorganization agreement. Secondly, the management of the merging companies is required to draft the cross border merger report known as reorganization prospectus explaining all legal and economic aspects of the cross-border merger to shareholders. Thirdly, the shareholders have to approve common draft terms at the meeting of shareholders. The final step is the registration of cross-border merger in commercial register and its entry into effect. The thesis analyses all these steps, discovering problems and offering proposals how to improve the process of reorganization...|$|E

The perceived location of a vertical border defined by vertical texture on one side, and horizontal texture on the other side, is biased towards the vertical texture.
