30|$|The {{knowledge}} of the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> end of each curve (different numbers for each measurement as implied below) led to {{the determination of the}} <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> end number for each curve and measurement. Thereafter by simply averaging the velocities within the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> end number we calculated the mean velocity (apparently for each curve and measurement). It is noted that the velocity of each measurement at the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> end of each curve was calculated with linear regression of the values right before and right after the curve implying that the trajectory and hence the variation of the velocity between two consecutive points, is linear.|$|R
