A straw boater was {{introduced}} in the early 20th century, worn with a red and white hat band featuring the college crest with its <b>burning</b> <b>bush</b> woven into it in red. During this time Prefects wore red silk arm-bands embroidered with a gold crest.|$|E
5|$|While in {{the desert}} Moses defends three young girls from brigands, {{only to find out}} their older sister is Tzipporah. Moses is welcomed by Tzipporah's father and the high priest of Midian, Jethro. After assimilating this new culture, Moses becomes a {{shepherd}} and marries Tzipporah. One day, while chasing a stray lamb, Moses discovers a <b>burning</b> <b>bush</b> through which God tells him to go back to Egypt and guide the Hebrew slaves to freedom. God bestows Moses' shepherding staff with his power and promises that he will tell Moses what to say. Moses and Tzipporah return to Egypt, where Moses is happily greeted by Rameses, who is now Pharaoh.|$|E
5|$|Lisa imagines she and all {{the other}} Springfield Elementary {{students}} are Hebrews in ancient Egypt, with the Pharaoh (Principal Skinner) making them build a pyramid. Only Moses (Milhouse) can liberate the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, supposedly incited by the <b>burning</b> <b>bush,</b> he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the sea, Lisa has an idea to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets to drain the sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, but the water fills the sea back up and swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, and then return to the shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if {{it is going to be}} smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many centuries, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna.|$|E
50|$|Located on {{the corner}} of Cross Bay Boulevard and East 9th Road, Gene Gray Playground opened on November 12, 1987 and was built at a cost of $457,688. In honor of Broad Channel's {{seafaring}} past, award-winning architect Richard Dattner incorporated a nautical fortress theme into the park's wooden play equipment. The playground contains a walkway bridge intended to resemble a sailing ship, complete with bow, stern, and gangplank-like ramp. The park also contains a 75-year-old willow tree (Salix spp.), nine red maple trees (Acer rubrum), and ninety <b>burning</b> <b>bushes</b> (Euonymus atropurpureus) along the perimeter.|$|R
30|$|There is {{emphasis}} {{on the fact that}} droppings from their cattle make the environment dirty and their method of milk processing attract flies resulting in infectious diseases such as cholera. Fulani pastoralists are also seen as very destructive of the environment. They are accused of polluting water bodies, <b>burning</b> <b>bushes</b> and cutting trees to feed their cattle. Others tag them with resource depletion and the destruction of some species of flora such as the shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa) 24 and thatch grasses (Hyparrhenia involucrata Stapf) for roofing houses. (It has to be noted here, though, that <b>bush</b> <b>burning</b> and other environmental destruction are not only done by the herders. Local farmers after harvesting set their farms ablaze and also cut down trees for firewood. Hunters equally set fire in search for bushmeat).|$|R
60|$|At present these <b>burning</b> <b>bushes</b> stand chiefly {{along the}} edge of the meadows, or I {{distinguish}} them afar on the hillsides here and there. Sometimes you will see many small ones in a swamp turned quite crimson when all other trees around are still perfectly green, and the former appear so much the brighter for it. They take you by surprise, as you are going by on one side, across the fields, thus early in the season, as if it were some gay encampment of the red men, or other foresters, of whose arrival you had not heard.|$|R

50|$|We {{laugh at}} this people's whims, and cry over its misdeeds. To act as God's chosen {{people is not}} only foolish and arrogant, it is a crime against humanity. We call it racism. … There are limits to our {{patience}} and {{there are limits to}} our tolerance. We do not believe in divine promises as a rationale for occupation and apartheid. We have left the Middle Ages behind. We laugh with embarrassment at those who still believe that the god of the flora, fauna and galaxies has chosen one particular people as his favorite, and given them amusing stone tablets, <b>burning</b> <b>bushes</b> and a license to kill.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{portrayals of}} God are entirely off-screen. For example: The God who gives the stone tablets to Moses in The Ten Commandments is, {{in the words}} of Paul Schrader's {{commentary}} to the film, [...] "off-screen to the right". Such biblical epics have less trouble with this obliquity than non-biblical works. This because whilst there is no visual representation of God himself in the source text that such movies are based upon, there are visually representable elements that can be used, from <b>burning</b> <b>bushes</b> to clouds and fire, in the s of God. So whilst biblical epics are constrained by their source text to aniconism, they are not denied spectacle.|$|R

25|$|The Bible {{provides}} ample {{additional material}} for mythic and mystical speculation. The prophet Ezekiel's visions in particular attracted much mystical speculation, as did Isaiah's Temple vision—Isaiah, Ch.6.

Moses' encounters with the <b>Burning</b> <b>bush</b> and God on Mount Sinai are evidence of mystical events in the Torah that form the origin of Jewish mystical beliefs.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the four}} large icons, three trefoil shaped {{paintings}} also {{belong to the}} first, Sovereign tier. Each of them is situated above a door.

The Last Supper is placed above the Royal Door, according to tradition. This {{is the most important}} sacrificial scene of the New Testament. Below the icon, on the Royal Door, there are four paintings each representing a sacrifice from the Old Testament. In this way the Last Supper connects the two testaments of the Bible.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} the impact of <b>bush</b> <b>burning</b> on the grassland and montane ecosystems of Obanliku Local Government Area of Cross River state. Three hypotheses were formulated for the study. The sample of the study consisted of 200 respondents, the sample distribution in terms of gender, location and occupation was equitable.

Based on the results obtained the following findings were made: significant relationship exists between <b>bush</b> <b>burning</b> and between people level of perception and their attitude toward <b>bush</b> <b>burning</b> on grassland and montane ecosystems conclusions were drawn and recommendations such as employing the service of environmentalists to serve as extension agents in communities, provision of articles in journal and textbooks in community and / or public libraries treating <b>bush</b> <b>burning</b> it’s impacts and the various mitigation measures to curb the problem were made...|$|R
30|$|The {{institutions}} {{responsible for}} forest and biodiversity management {{at both the}} federal and state levels are coordinated via the National Council on Environment. The National Council on Environment is made up of the Federal Ministry of Environment and State Commissions of Environment.

25|$|Pre-eminent {{among the}} saints is the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God. In Orthodox theology, the Mother of God is the {{fulfillment}} of the Old Testament archetypes revealed in the Ark of the Covenant (because she carried the New Covenant {{in the person of}} Christ) and the <b>burning</b> <b>bush</b> that appeared before Moses (symbolizing the Mother of God's carrying of God without being consumed). Accordingly, the Orthodox consider Mary to be the Ark of the New Covenant and give her the respect and reverence as such. The Theotokos was chosen by God and she freely co-operated in that choice to be the Mother of Jesus Christ, the God-man.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the most}} famous works {{formerly}} attributed to René are the triptych of the <b>Burning</b> <b>Bush</b> of Nicolas Froment of Avignon in Aix Cathedral, showing portraits of René and his second wife, Jeanne de Laval, and an illuminated Book of Hours in the French National Library. Among the men of letters attached to his court was Antoine de la Sale, whom he made tutor to his son John. He encouraged the performance of mystery plays; on the performance of a mystery of the Passion at Saumur in 1462 he remitted four years of taxes to the town, and the representations of the Passion at Angers were carried out under his auspices.|$|E
25|$|According to the Book of Exodus, Moses {{was born}} in a time when his people, the Israelites, an enslaved minority, were {{increasing}} in numbers and the Egyptian Pharaoh was worried that they might ally themselves with Egypt's enemies. Moses' Hebrew mother, Jochebed, secretly hid him when the Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed {{in order to reduce the}} population of the Israelites. Through the Pharaoh's daughter (identified as Queen Bithia in the Midrash), the child was adopted as a foundling from the Nile river and grew up with the Egyptian royal family. After killing an Egyptian slavemaster (because the slavemaster was smiting a Hebrew), Moses fled across the Red Sea to Midian, where he encountered The Angel of the Lord, speaking to him from within a <b>burning</b> <b>bush</b> on Mount Horeb (which he regarded as the Mountain of God).|$|E
40|$|The large shijimi blue, Shijimiaeoides divinus, is a {{grassland}} lycaenid butterfly {{classified as}} {{an endangered species}} by the Ministry of Environment. In this study, I report on the life history of S. divinus barine and provide new data on {{the recovery of the}} natural population in Azumino. This butterfly is single-breeded with the adults usually appearing from late May to early June in Nagano Prefecture. Only three populations of S. divinus barine are maintained in Nagano Prefecture by several volunteer groups. In Azumino, efforts to introduce individuals at pupal stage in a butterfly sanctuary failed because of appearance of the egg parasite Trichogramma chilonis, which is an important mortality factor of the egg stage of S. divinus barine. On March 29, 2009, we experimentally tested the effect of <b>bush</b> <b>burning</b> on eggs parasitoids. <b>Bush</b> <b>burning</b> proved to {{have a negative effect on}} T. chilonis.

5000|$|The {{police were}} never very {{far behind the}} bushrangers and on 11 March 1863, shots were {{exchanged}} between them, Daley and O'Meally.

25|$|The Ethiopian church {{places a}} heavier {{emphasis}} on Old Testament teachings {{than one might}} find in Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic or Protestant churches, and its followers adhere to certain practices that one finds in Orthodox or Conservative Judaism. Ethiopian Christians, like some other Eastern Christians, traditionally follow dietary rules {{that are similar to}} Jewish Kashrut, specifically with regard to how an animal is slaughtered. Similarly, pork is prohibited, though unlike Rabbinical Kashrut, Ethiopian cuisine does mix dairy products with meat. Women are prohibited from entering the church temple during menses; they are also expected to cover their hair with a large scarf (or shash) while in church, as described in 1 Corinthians, chapter 11. As with Orthodox synagogues, men and women are seated separately in the Ethiopian church, with men on the left and women on the right (when facing the altar). (Women covering their heads and separation of the sexes in churches officially is common to some other Christian traditions; it is also the rule in some non-Christian religions, Islam and Orthodox Judaism among them). Ethiopian Orthodox worshippers remove their shoes when entering a church temple, in accordance with Exodus 3:5 (in which Moses, while viewing the <b>burning</b> <b>bush,</b> was commanded to remove his shoes while standing on holy ground). Furthermore, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church upholds Sabbatarianism, observing the seventh-day Sabbath (Saturday), in addition to the Lord's Day (Sunday), although more emphasis, because of the Resurrection of Christ, is laid upon Sunday.

40|$|Soil erosion {{is one of}} the {{unresolved}} {{problems of}} rural agriculture. This study investigates the impact of soil erosion on the agricultural potential and performance of Sheshegu community farmers in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. Structured interview scheduled was used to collect data from 50 respondents using simple random sampling. Findings revealed that most (62 %) respondents are male, who are above 46 years old (68 %). Most of whom (72 %) had education above grade 7. Further, the majority of them (50. 8 %) depend on social grants as sources of income. Most respondents confirmed that erosion occurred naturally through heavy rainfall and persistent drought while human causes that facilitated erosion include farming activities, deforestation and indiscriminate <b>bush</b> <b>burning</b> that expose soil to impact of rain drop. Respondents affirmed that erosion contributed to poor health of livestocks due to lack of pasture grass to feed on, loss of grazing land and poor bush regrowth. It is recommended that awareness on the negative effect of human causes of erosion should be created while simple technologies on soil erosion control should be pushed to the farmers.
