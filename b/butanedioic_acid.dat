40|$|The {{adsorption}} and two-dimensional self {{assembly of}} enantiopure and racemic malic acid (MA) on Cu(110) {{has been studied}} in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) with temperature programmed desorption (TPD), {{low energy electron diffraction}} (LEED), UV- and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, XPS), as well as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In order to get detailed informations on the chemical structure of the adsorbate complex, the first UHV surface infrared spectrometer (reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy, RAIRS) in Switzerland has been installed. Depending on the coverage and the deposition conditions, eleven ordered structures of (R) - and (S) -MA were observed with LEED and STM. As previously reported for tartaric acid on this surface, MA shows two adsorbate modes in which either one (monomalate) or both carboxyl groups (bimalate) react with the surface under deprotonation. The high-coverage monolayer shows ”surface explosion”, a rapid decomposition phenomenon observed in TPD. As observed in STM the two-dimensionally ordered bimalate structures show features which are interpreted as reconstruction of the underlying Cu surface. This is the first direct STM observation of adsorption-induced reconstruction on Cu(110) for <b>butanedioic</b> <b>acids</b> and suggests that a pronounced chirality transfer via the substrate, rather than by intermolecular hydrogen bonding, occurs. Racemic MA shows ordered structures that have not been observed for the pure enantiomers. Our structure models consider therefore heterochiral pairs as building blocks. Surface reconstructions have been observed directly. Only at full monolayer coverage a well ordered c(2 × 4) phase covers the entire crystal surface. All other structures are only observed in small patches. The racemic c(2 × 4) shows an even better order than the enantiopure counterpart, indicating again a heterochiral arrangement of monomalate molecules. We also investigated the effect of chiral conflict, that is, mixing of tartaric acid (TA) and malic acid (MA). Racemic TA shows a superposition of the two enantiomorphs in LEED that are observed for the pure TA enantiomers. Adding one enantiomer of MA at a concentration of 25 - 75...|$|R

40|$|Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T 2 DM) is {{a chronic}} {{metabolic}} disorder with systemic complications {{and has been}} a worldwide epidemic. Ophiopogon japonicus is a traditional Chinese medicine used to treat diabetes for thousands of years. From our previous work, we know that MDG- 1, a water-soluble β-D-fructan polysaccharide from O. japonicas could treat T 2 DM experimentally. However, MDG- 1 is poorly absorbed and its mechanism of action is still unknown. Therefore, a GC TOF/MS-based metabonomic approach in combination with multivariate statistical analysis was performed to investigate the mechanism of MDG- 1 in a spontaneous diabetic model. Female diabetic KKay mice (21 weeks old) were randomly divided into a diabetic group (n = 6, gavaged with distilled water) and a MDG- 1 -Diabetic group (n = 7, gavaged with MDG- 1, 300 mg kg− 1) and female C 57 BL/ 6 mice (21 weeks old) were set as controls (n = 6, gavaged with distilled water). After 8 -weeks of treatment, feces samples were collected for GC-TOF/MS analysis. Consequently, 12 potential biomarkers were identified, including monosugars (D-tagatose, D-lyxose, D-erythrose, xylo-hexos- 5 -ulose, 2 -deoxy-galactose), <b>butanedioic</b> <b>acid,</b> amino acids (phenylalanine, L-lysine, L-methionine, L-aspartic acid) and purine derivatives (7 H-purine, 2 ′-deoxyinosine). We assume the monosugars and <b>butanedioic</b> <b>acid</b> were the fermentation products of MDG- 1 by intestinal microbes and MDG- 1 actions against diabetes might be accomplished through the absorbable monosugars and <b>butanedioic</b> <b>acid</b> via suppressing intestinal glucose absorption, enhancing liver glycogenesis, inhibiting glycogenolysis and promoting GLP- 1 secretion. Besides, MDG- 1 might alleviate diabetes and diabetic nephropathy by reducing 7 H-purine and 2 ′-deoxyinosine.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{molecular}} structure on photocatalytic oxidation was evaluated {{by comparing the}} performance of <b>butanedioic</b> <b>acid,</b> propanol and their hydroxylated derivates in an aqueous TiO 2 suspension. The influence of Pt deposits had on the photooxidation of these compounds was also studied. The photoactivity was found {{to depend on the}} nature of the parent substance and its level of hydroxylation. The presence of additional hydroxyl functional groups on <b>butanedioic</b> <b>acid</b> accelerated the diacid disappearance rate but decreased the overall mineralisation rate. Accelerated diacid disappearance was attributed to increased parent organic adsorption via enhanced bonding between the extra OH groups and the TiO 2 surface. The slower mineralisation rates were ascribed to the additional hydroxyl groups altering or enhancing intermediate formation to produce more recalcitrant intermediates (e. g. ethanoic acid). In contrast, no consistent relationship was found between the additional hydroxyl group number and mineralisation rate for the alcohols. Hydroxyl addition to propanol was proposed to not significantly alter its adsorption mode on TiO 2 leading to similar disappearance rates for the alcohols. Differences in mineralisation rates were observed and thought to be dominated by differences in degradation rates of the generated intermediates. Pt/TiO 2 displayed a higher photoactivity than bare TiO 2 for both organic groups. Similar intermediates were formed irrespective of the Pt presence with its function as an electron sink primarily responsible for the enhancement. The Pt deposits also displayed a thermal (dark) catalytic effect for oxidising formic acid. Its dark catalysis was augmented by pre-irradiating the Pt/TiO 2 with UV light. Pre-irradiation was suspected to enhance electron accumulation in the Pt deposits, in turn facilitating oxygen dissociation which then enhanced formic acid oxidation. The pre- irradiation effect decayed with time but could be readily recovered by re- irradiating the Pt/TiO 2. This dark catalytic effect may further contribute to the overall Pt/TiO 2 photoactivity as formic acid is a commonly generated intermediate from photocatalysis...|$|E

Soc. 1993, 115, 9563 − 9567) showed that, in water, the conformational preferences for the gauche conformations for <b>butanedioic</b> <b>acid</b> and its monoanion and dianion were, respectively, ∼ 84 %, 66 %, and 43 %, essentially independent {{of the nature of the}} cation or concentration. We now report the corresponding gauche percentages calculated in the same way for 0. 05 M solutions in THF to be 66 %, 90 − 100 %, and 46 − 64 %. Substantial evidence was adduced for the rotational angle between the substituents in the monoanion being ∼ 70 °. The positions of conformational equilibria of the salts in THF, particularly of the dianion, were found to be rather insensitive to concentration and temperature, but more sensitive to the amount of water present. Ab initio quantum-mechanical calculations for 1, 4 -butanedioate dianion indicate that, as expected for the gas phase, the trans conformation of the dianion should be heavily favored over the gauche, but, in both THF and water, the gauche conformation is calculated to predominate with rotational angles substantially less than 60 °.

The analysis of the phytochemical constituents in MTBE and M/C extracts was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. The mass spectra of the compounds was matched with the NIST 08 mass spectral library. Results: The present study revealed that the extraction using two-phase M/C have resulted in higher metabolite coverage compared to the extraction with MTBE. Direct solvent extraction using MTBE revealed the presence of 27 compounds; whereas, M/C allowed the extraction of 18 and 36 compounds in polar (methanol) and nonpolar (chloroform) fractions respectively.

Modern studies have revealed that plant compounds (phytochemicals) have a wide range of biological properties and may provide human health benefits. Several plants native to North America have been used traditionally by the Native Americans for medicinal purposes but have not been examined for their phytochemical constituents. Based on preliminary studies of several such plant candidates, our laboratory selected two native and previously un-investigated plants, namely, Cornus amomum Mill. (silky dogwood) and Rhus copallinum L., (winged sumac) for further detailed study. Compounds were isolated using a series of chromatographic methods and identified on the basis of extensive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectral data. Also, the plant extracts and their purified isolates were evaluated for antioxidant (using the DPPH radical scavenging assay) and human cancer cell cytotoxicty (using the MTS assay) activities. ^ In the first study our objectives were: 1) to evaluate silky dogwood fruit extract (SDFE) for antioxidant potential and cytotoxicity effects against human breast (MCF 7, MDA-MB- 231) and colon (HT 29, HCT 116) tumor cells, and 2) to identify the phenolic constituents present in SDFE. Three phenolic compounds that included two flavonoids, quercetin (1) and 3 -O-methylquercetin (2), as well as tyrosol (3), were isolated and identified from SDFE. In addition, two anthocyanins, though not isolated, were identified from SDFE using tandem liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods as delphinidin-trihexoside and delphinidin-dihexoside. In the antioxidant assay, the compounds had IC 50 values ranging from 70 - 188 μM. ^ The second study details the phytochemical and biological examination of winged sumac fruit and leaves. A new phenolic compound, 1 ’, 2 ’-di(methoxycarbonyl) ethyl 3, 4, 5 -trihydroxybenzoate, along with other thirteen known compounds were obtained including a <b>butanedioic</b> <b>acid</b> derivative, ten phenolics and two triterpenes. All of the isolated compounds were assayed for their antioxidant and human cancer cell cytotoxicity activities. The best anticancer effects against two human cancer colon cell lines (Caco- 2, HCT- 116) were observed with betulinic acid and pentagalloyl glucose with IC 50 values ranging from 84. 6 - 102. 1 μM. The other metabolites showed IC 50 values ranging from 100. 2 - 180. 1 μM. In the antioxidant assay, the compounds had IC 50 values ranging from 23 - 70 μM. ^ Taken together, these results suggest that silky dogwood and winged sumac may be explored as sources of bioactive compounds with potential nutraceutical values given their prevalence and underutilization in North America.

MethodsTwo different techniques of direct solvent extractions, i. e. methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) extraction and two-phase methanol/chloroform (M/C) system, {{were used in}} this study. The analysis of the phytochemical constituents in MTBE and M/C extracts was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. The mass spectra of the compounds was matched with the NIST 08 mass spectral library. ResultsThe present study revealed that the extraction using two-phase M/C have resulted in higher metabolite coverage compared to the extraction with MTBE. Direct solvent extraction using MTBE revealed the presence of 27 compounds; whereas, M/C allowed the extraction of 18 and 36 compounds in polar (methanol) and nonpolar (chloroform) fractions respectively. The major compounds detected in the MTBE extract that based on the peak area percentage were methenolone (16. 64 %), cycloisolongifolene, 8, 9 -dehydro- 9 -formyl- (15. 93 %), labd- 13 -en- 15 -oic acid, 8, 12 -epoxy- 12 -hydroxy-γ-lactone (10. 77 %), propiolic acid, 3 -(1 -hydroxy) - 2 isopropyl- 1, 5 -methylcyclohexyl) (7. 84 %), 4 -oxo-β-isodamascol (5. 17 %), velleral (3. 11 %) and Z-α-farnesene (2. 00 %). The most prevailing major compounds identified in the polar fraction of the M/C extraction were α-D glucopyranoside, 1, 3, 4, 6 tetrakis-O-(TMS) (trimethylsilyl) -β-D-fructofuranosyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetrakis-O-(TMS) - (38. 08 %), d-glucose, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentakis-O-(TMS) -, O-methyloxime (14. 61 %), D-fructose, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentakis-O-(TMS) -, O-methyloxime (5. 28 %), isocitric acid (TMS) (3. 06 %), oxalic acid, bis (TMS) ester (2. 96 %), hexadecanoic acid, TMS ester (2. 16 %), citric acid, ethyl ester, tri-TMS (1. 91 %) and <b>butanedioic</b> <b>acid,</b> [(TMS) oxy]-, bis (TMS) ester (1. 14 %); whereas in the nonpolar extract, among the major compounds detected were cycloisolongifolene, 8, 9 -dehydro − 9 -formyl (15. 70 %), propiolic acid, 3 -(1 -hydroxy- 2 -isopropyl- 5 -methylcyclohexyl) (11. 09 %), stearic acid, TMS ester (2. 78 %), hexadecanoic acid, TMS ester (2. 33 %), oleic acid, TMS ester (1. 62 %), curzerene (1. 56 %); Z-α-farnesene (1. 52 %), germacrone (1. 41 %) and β-elemene (1. 33 %). ConclusionsIt was evident from the results that C. aeruginosa rhizome extracted using two different techniques of solvent extractions (MTBE and M/C) contained various chemical classes of compounds including terpenoids, sterols, organic acids, fatty acids and sugars. Different methods of extraction have led to different compounds extraction for C. aeruginosa rhizome. The results also indicated that the plant {{was a source of}} phytochemical importance...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to design {{and to develop a}} high {{performance}} catalyst for the production of hydrogen from reforming of crude ethanol and also, to develop the kinetics and reactor model of crude ethanol reforming process. Crude ethanol reforming is an endothermic reaction of ethanol and other oxygenated hydrocarbons such as (lactic acid, glycerol and maltose) with water present in fermentation broth to produce hydrogen (H 2) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts were prepared using different preparation methods such as coprecipitation, precipitation and impregnation methods with different Ni loadings of 10 – 25 wt. %, 10 - 20 wt. %, and 10 - 20 wt. % respectively. All catalysts were characterised by thermogravimetric/differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), (including X-ray line broadening), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), BET surface area measurements, pore volume and pore size distribution analysis. TG/DSC analyses for the uncalcined catalysts showed the catalyst were stable up from 600 oC. XRD analyses showed the presence of NiO, NiAl 2 O 4 and Al 2 O 3 species on the calcined catalysts whereas Ni, NiAl 2 O 4, and Al 2 O 3 were present on reduced catalysts. BET surface area decreased and average pore diameter reached a maximum and then decreased as the Ni loading increased. The temperature programmed reduction profiles showed peaks corresponding to the reduction of NiO between 400 - 600 oC and reduction of NiAl 2 O 4 between 700 - 800 oC. Catalyst screening was performed in a micro reactor with calcination temperature, reaction temperature and the ratio of catalyst weight to crude ethanol flow rate (W/Fcrude-C 2 H 5 OH) of 600 oC, 400 oC and 0. 59 h respectively. Maximum crude-ethanol conversion of 85 mol% was observed for catalyst with 15 wt% Ni loading prepared by precipitation method (PT 15), while maximum hydrogen yield (= 4. 33 moles H 2 / mol crude-ethanol feed) was observed for catalyst with 15 wt% Ni loading prepared by coprecipitation (CP 15). Performance tests were carried out on (CP 15) in which variables such as space velocity (WHSV) 1. 68 h- 1 to 4. 68 h- 1, reduction temperature 400 to 600 oC and reaction temperature 320 to 520 oC, were changed for optimum performance evaluation of the selected catalyst. The catalyst deactivated over first three hours of 11 hours time-on-stream (TOS) before it stabilized, the reaction conditions resulted in a drop of ethanol conversion from 80 to 70 mol%. The compounds identified in the liqiud products in all cases were ethanoic acid, butanoic acid, butanal, propanone, propanoic acid, propylene glycol and <b>butanedioic</b> <b>acid.</b> The kinetic analysis was carried out for the rate data obtained for the reforming of crude ethanol reaction that produced only hydrogen and carbon dioxide. These data were fitted to the power law model and Eldey Rideal models for the entire temperature range of 320 - 520 oC. The activation energy found were 4405 and 4428 kJ/kmol respectively. Also the simulation of reactor model showed that irrespective of the operating temperature, the benefit of an increase in reactor length is limited. It also showed that by neglecting the axial dispersion term in the model the crude ethanol conversion is under predicted. In addition the beneficial effects of W/FAO start to diminish as its value increases (i. e. at lower flow rates) ...|$|E
40|$|The world's proven {{reserves}} {{of crude oil}} will be depleted in 42 years at {{the current rate of}} consumption. Oil refiners are under considerable economic and environmental pressure to improve the efficiency of refining and the quality and definition of products. Statistical and fundamental models are extensively used to more accurately model the important refinery processes such as Fluidised Catalytic Cracking (FCC). A major problem with the fundamental approach is that FCC feedstocks are by definition heavy petroleum fractions, and as such constitute highly complex mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis of heavy petroleum fractions reveals a broad 'hump' of unresolved compounds termed an Unresolved Complex Mixture (UCM) of hydrocarbons. Conventional instrumental techniques alone are unable to elucidate the composition of UCMs, they are simply too complex. Oxidative degradation of UCMs has already been used with some success to selectively oxidise aliphatic and aromatic UCMs to reveal some of the structures incorporated in UCMs from various natural and anthropogenic sources. Ruthenium tetroxide (RUO 4) attacks aromatic rings at the ipso-carbon of aromatic moieties. Unsubstituted aromatic carbon is oxidised to CO 2 whereas substituents are preserved as carboxylic acids. "Retro-structural analysis" involves reconstruction of the products of oxidation to reveal the original molecule or 'average' molecule. However, previous studies have highlighted problems with the recovery of products from die oxidation of hydroaromatic compounds. Hydroaromatic compounds contain an alicyclic ring attached to an aromatic ring e. g. tetralin. This study presents evidence that (theoretically) data from RUO 4 oxidation FCC feedstocks can make a significant improvement to the accuracy of FCC modelling at BP Amoco. RUO 4 oxidation and work-up procedures were developed further in an attempt to overcome problems with 'losses' of oxidation products from hydroaromatic compounds, including an improved carbon dioxide trap. Several novel hydroaromatic compounds and a diaromatic compound proposed in a previous study as being 'average' UCM components were synthesised and fully characterised by GC, GCMS, FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. The compounds synthesised were 6 -cyclohexyltetralin, l-(3 '- methylbutyl) 7 -cyclohexyltetralin, 1 -n-nonyl- 7 -cyclohexyltetralin and 1 -/n-nonyl- 7 - cyclohexylnaphthalene. RUO 4 oxidation of the synthetic compounds and commercial tetralin revealed that while losses of between 70 and 50 % of the expected water soluble dicarboxylic acids are observed, these losses can be at least partially accounted for by the 'over oxidation' of carboxylic acids to produce smaller carboxylic acids. For example, the RUO 4 oxidation of tetralin produces 1, 6 -hexanedioic acid as a major product but significant amounts of 1, 5 -pentanedioic acid is observed along with trace amounts of 1, 4 - <b>butanedioic</b> <b>acid.</b> Smaller acids are likely to be undetected or lost as butyl esters during the work-up. Where 2 -n-nonyl- 1, 6 -hexanedioic acid was produced, decanoic and nonanoic acid as well as 1, 5 - pentanedioic acid and 1, 4 -butanedioic acid were observed corresponding to oxidation of the 2 - position on the dicarboxylic acid. The three major products from RUO 4 oxidation of ln-nonyl- 7 -cyclohexylnaphthalene were partially oxidised compounds including 2 -(l-oxo-n-decane) - 4 -cyclohexylbenzoic acid, showing that the oxidation of diaromatic compounds in UCMs gives more complex oxidation products. This is consistent with previous studies where diaromatic UCMs were oxidised to give a more complex 'oxidised UCM' rather than simple carboxylic acids. The observation of monocarboxylic acids in oxidation products from the alicyclic portion of a hydroaromatic compound has not previously been reported. This represents a new source of monocarboxylic acids in the RUO 4 oxidation products of UCMs and should be taken into account when oxidising UCMs likely to contain a significant proportion of hydroaromatic structures, such as hydrotreated FCC feedstocks. The synthesis and oxidation of di-substituted teiralins has increased the understanding of RuG 4 oxidation products from UCMs and consequently furthered the use of RUO 4 as a potentially useftjl tool in the elucidation of FCC feedstock compositions and other aromatic UCMs...|$|E
