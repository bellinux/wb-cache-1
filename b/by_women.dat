5|$|Although the {{creation}} of literature was predominantly a male scribal pursuit, some works {{are thought to have}} been written <b>by</b> <b>women.</b> For example, several references to women writing letters and surviving private letters sent and received <b>by</b> <b>women</b> have been found. However, Edward F. Wente asserts that, even with explicit references to women reading letters, it is possible that women employed others to write documents.|$|E
5|$|A {{movement}} <b>by</b> <b>women</b> {{arose from}} Seattle during the Depression.

5|$|Efforts to {{calculate}} the true economic value of unpaid work, which {{is not included in}} measures such as gross domestic product, have shown that this value is enormous. In the United States, it has been estimated to be between 20–50%, meaning that the true value of unpaid work is trillions of dollars per year. For other countries, the percentage of GDP may be even higher, such as the United Kingdom, where is may be as high as 70%. Because this unpaid work is largely done <b>by</b> <b>women</b> and is unreported in economic indicators, it results in these contributions <b>by</b> <b>women</b> being devalued in a society.|$|E

5|$|Lesbians {{portrayed in}} literature, film, and {{television}} often shape contemporary thought about women's sexuality. The majority of media about lesbians {{is produced by}} men; women's publishing companies did not develop until the 1970s, films about lesbians made <b>by</b> <b>women</b> did not appear until the 1980s, and television shows portraying lesbians written <b>by</b> <b>women</b> only began to be created in the 21st century. As a result, homosexuality—particularly dealing with women—has been excluded because of symbolic annihilation. When depictions of lesbians began to surface, they were often one-dimensional, simplified stereotypes.|$|E
