40|$|For {{the present}} study, a {{mathematical}} model AMRA was created to simulate the aeroelastic behaviour of a rotor during autorotation. Our model: Aeroelastic Model of a Rotor in Autorotation (AMRA) captures transverse bending and teeter, torsional twist and lag-wise motion of the rotor blade and hence {{it is used to}} investigate couplings between blade flapping, torsion and rotor speed. Lagrange’s method was used for the modelling of blade flapping and chord-wise bending. Torsional twist of the rotor blade was modelled with the aid of finite element method (FEM), and blade transverse bending could also be modelled in FEM. The model can switch between using a full FEM model for bending and torsion, or a FEM model for torsion and simple blade teeter, depending on the complexity that the user requires. The AMRA model was verified against experimental data obtained during a CAA sponsored flight test programme of the G-UNIV autogyro. Published results of modal analysis of helicopter rotor blades and other data published in open literature were used to validate the FEM model of the rotor blade. The first torsional natural frequency of the ’McCutcheon’ rotor blades was measured with the aid of high-speed camera and used for validation of the FEM model of blade torsional twist. As a further verification of the modelling method, Aérospatiale Puma helicopter rotor blade data were compared on a Southwell plot showing comparison between experimental results and AMRA estimation. The aeromechanical behaviour of the rotor during both axial flight and forward flight in autorotation was investigated. A significant part of the research was focused on investigation of the effect of different values of torsional and flexural stiffness, and the relative positions of blade shear centre/elastic axis and centre of mass of the blade on stability during the autorotation. The results obtained with the aid of the model demonstrate the interesting, and unique, characteristics of the autorotative regime - with instabilities possible in bending and torsion, but also in rotorspeed. Coupled rotor speed/flap/twist oscillations (flutter and divergence) occur if the torsional stiffness of the blade is lower than a critical value, or if the <b>blade</b> <b>centre</b> of mass is significantly aft of the blade twisting axis, {{as is the case in}} helicopter pitch-flap flutter. The instability shown here, however, is specific to the autogyro, or autorotating rotor, as it is coupled with rotorspeed, and so differs from both helicopter rotor flutter and fixed-wing flutter. The coupling with rotorspeed allows a combined flutter and divergence instability, where the rotor begins to flutter in rotorspeed, teeter angle and torsional twist and, once the rotorspeed had dropped below a critical value, then moves into divergence in flap and rotorspeed. It was found that the aeroelastic behaviour of a rotor in autorotation is significantly affected by the strong coupling of blade bending stiffness and teeter angle with rotorspeed, and the strong coupling between blade aeroelastic twist and rotor torque. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{gyroplane}} {{represents the}} first successful rotorcraft design and it {{paved the way for}} the development of the helicopter during the 1940 s. Gyroplane rotors are not powered in flight and work in autorotative regime and hence the characteristics of a helicopter rotor during powered flight and a rotor in autorotation differ significantly. Gyroplanes in the UK have been involved in number of fatal accidents during the last two decades. Despite several research projects focused on gyroplane flight dynamics, the cause of some of gyroplane accidents still remains unclear. The aeroelastic behaviour of autorotating rotors is a relatively unexplored problem and it has not yet been investigated as possible cause of the accidents. A mathematical model was created to simulate aeroelastic behaviour of rotors in autorotation. The model can investigate couplings between blade teeter, bending, torsion and rotor speed using a finite element model combined with a blade element method and a dynamic inflow model. A set of 'McCutcheon' rotor blades was subjected to a series of experiments, yielding baseline input parameters for the model. The model was validated against published results of modal analysis of helicopter rotor blades, experimental flight measurements and other data published in open literature. Effect of selected rotor design parameters on performance and stability of autorotating rotors was analyzed. Results of the model suggest that steady autorotative flight is not possible for excessive values of blade fixed incidence angle or geometric twist of the blade, leading to an aeromechanical instability. Negative values of these parameters lead to rotor over-speed, loss of rotor thrust and increase in vehicle speed of descent. The simulations have shown that moderate values of blade geometric twist applied to the inboard region of the blade together with blade tip mass can improve stability of a rotor in autorotation. A significant part of the research was focused on investigation of the effect of different values of torsional and flexural stiffness, and the relative chord-wise positions of blade elastic axis and centre of mass on rotor stability during autorotation. The results obtained from the model demonstrate an interesting and unique characteristic of the autorotative regime. Coupled flap-twist-rotor speed oscillations of the rotor occur if the torsional stiffness of the blade is lower than a critical value and if the <b>blade</b> <b>centre</b> of mass is aft of the blade elastic axis. The new type of aeroelastic instability is specific to autorotating rotors and differs from both helicopter rotor flutter and fixed-wing flutter. An extra degree of freedom in rotor speed does not alter flutter onset point significantly and hence this instability can be classified as pitch-flap flutter, with the stability boundary of a hyperbolic shape. However, variation of rotor speed in response to coupled flexural and torsional dynamics of the rotor blades changes behaviour of the rotor during the instability. The coupling of rotor teeter, blade torsion and rotor speed with vehicle speed of descent results in a combined flutter and divergence instability. The investigation aeroelastic behaviour of rotors in autorotation has shown that although autorotation has strong autostabilizing character, catastrophic aeroelastic instability can occur. Aeroelastic instability of this type has not been previously described in open literature. The instability can be initiated by incorrect mass balance of the rotor blades together with their insufficient torsional stiffness. Alternatively, unsuitable rotor geometry causing excessive blade incidence can prevent the rotor from entering steady autorotation. Hence a rotor in autorotation with unsuitable design of rotor blades can encounter an aeroelastic instability even if it is correctly mass balanced.

40|$|Aviation is a pastime {{enjoyed by}} many amateur pilots. Of the 21 000 {{aircraft}} {{registered in the}} UK [1], 96 % are engaged in general aviation activities (non-commercial flying). The UK Civil Aviation Authority (UK CAA) classifies microlights, gliders and autogyros as recreational sports aircraft. Of the 21 000 UK-registered general aviation aircraft, only 306 are autogyros, compared to over 4300 microlights and almost 2600 gliders. Despite this fact, the autogyro has been seen to exhibit a fatal accident rate up to 100 times {{higher than those of}} the microlight or glider. In response to the identification of this high accident rate amongst autogyro type vehicles, the CAA commissioned a programme of research intended to understand the cause. This research, undertaken in the UK by the University of Glasgow, consisted of analytical, wind tunnel and flight test activities. These studies concluded that the autogyro displayed “conventional lateral and directional dynamic stability characteristics”, and that both the static and dynamic stability (in particular, a lightly damped phugoid mode) was highly sensitive to the vertical position of the centre of gravity (c. g.) relative to the propeller thrust line. The lack of provision within the autogyro community to collect meaningful data in relation to the airworthiness requirements was also highlighted. Outside of the work performed as part of the research programme that generated this report, there is still considered to be “little indication that rigorous scientific or engineering investigation of airworthiness has occurred”. Therefore, there remains significant scope for further research into just what makes autogyros so unsafe to fly and how to improve their airworthiness. Prior research into the autogyro and its aerodynamic characteristics can be broadly divided into two phases, the first being from its inception in 1923 to the beginning of World War II and the period between 1996 and the present day, when a resurgence of interest in the autogyro began to occur. Much of the early works concentrate on characterising the autogyro’s aerodynamic characteristics, relying heavily upon wind tunnel testing, flight testing and analytical investigation to establish an understanding of the fundamental flight dynamics of the autogyro. With the first flight of the first functional helicopter, the outbreak of World War II and the death of the inventor of the autogyro, research interest in this aircraft type was critically diminished. Only three papers on the subject of autogyros were published between 1939 and 1996. The Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) review of the airworthiness of the grounded Air Command autogyro, conducted after the occurrence of 5 fatal accidents between 1989 and 1991, recommended the commissioning of a programme of research into both the airworthiness and aerodynamic characteristics of light autogyros. As a result of this recommendation, the autogyro experienced a resurgence in research interest, culminating in the publication of a CAA Paper which presented 4 recommendations intended to improve the airworthiness of the autogyro: 1. It is recommended that the vertical location of the centre of gravity (c. g.) should lie within a ± 2 inch envelope of the propeller thrust line. 2. Horizontal tailplanes are largely ineffective in improving the long term pitch dynamic stability (phugoid mode). 3. Extreme manoeuvring can lead to excessive rotor teeter angles during certain phases of flight, potentially resulting in the rotor blades striking the prop or empennage. 4. The chordwise centre of gravity of the rotor blades should always lie at or ahead of the 25 % chord position to prevent rotor blade instability. One of the primary aims of this Thesis was to assess the validity and applicability of these recommendations; in order to do so, a simulation model of an autogyro was created. The model was based on the G-UNIV research autogyro owned by Glasgow University and validated against flight test data in order to ensure the required level of fidelity was achieved. Upon re-assessing the recommendations, in some cases, different conclusions were drawn. The first recommendation, while accepted as a sensible design aim, was found to be overly restrictive. BCAR Section T, the airworthiness specification for autogyros, specifies requirements on the period and time to half amplitude of any longitudinal oscillations present in the aircraft. Limiting the vertical position of the centre of gravity to within ± 2 inches of the propeller thrustline resulted in forcing a design which is compliant with the requirements of BCAR Section T outside the specified range, to become non-compliant when the centre of gravity lies within the range. Recommendation 2 suggests that the removal of the tailplane of the aircraft has little impact on the longitudinal trim control positions and the characteristics of the phugoid mode. It was found that the results from the simulation model disagreed with this conclusion; the removal of the tailplane changed the characteristics of the phugoid model and the trimmed control positions significantly. The third recommendation highlighted the potential for a rotor blade to strike the propeller or the empennage under extreme manoeuvring. The simulation environment provided a safe environment in which to test this recommendation; it was found under the loading of an extreme manoeuvre it was possible for the main rotor to strike the tail, supporting the conclusion drawn in CAA Report 2009 / 02. It was not possible to assess the fourth and final recommendation, relating the positioning of the chord-wise position of the <b>blade</b> <b>centre</b> of gravity, due to the limitations of the simulation model developed. Another focus of the recent work surrounding the autogyro has been on quantifying and assessing the handling qualities of such vehicles. This presents many challenges, including the fact that no autogyro-specific handling qualities specifications currently exist. One of the main themes of this Thesis was to progress towards the creation of such a specification, either through development of a new methodology or development of existing specifications, such as ADS- 33 E-PRF. The first steps in this field have been taken by Glasgow University using ADS- 33; the primary specification used in the assessment of military rotorcraft. Assessment of the autogyro was previously carried out in a real-world flight trial using existing Mission Task Elements (MTEs) taken from ADS- 33, the Slalom and the Acceleration-Deceleration. The results from this trial were then used to derive proposed Level 1, 2 and 3 boundaries for quickness and pilot attack. This Thesis replicated this trial using real-time piloted simulation, and the method described in the work carried out by Glasgow University was also utilised to derive a set of predicted handling qualities Levels for both quickness and pilot attack. It was found that the predicted Level boundaries generated from the simulation trial did not agree well with those predicted in the original flight trial. There were several reasons for this; in the original flight trial the pilot used a non-standard technique to fly the Slalom manoeuvre, using sideslip to complete the test course. Additionally, both the original flight trial and the simulated flight trial used data from several different course geometries. This resulted in the ordering of the Level boundaries being reversed for the Levels predicted by the simulated flight trial, as those test points carried out on the more aggressive course geometries received lower handling qualities ratings, whilst using the most aggressive control inputs, compared to those on easier courses which used lower magnitude and aggression inputs, and thus a lower quickness, while receiving better handling qualities. Recommendations were made to address these issues in future iterations of this work. This Thesis also sought to establish whether the MTEs specified in ADS- 33 highlighted the deficiencies within the autogyro {{in the same manner as}} they do in the helicopter, as well as identifying the fundamental differences between the autogyro and helicopter. For the most part, the MTEs chosen did highlight the deficiencies in the same manner for both autogyro and helicopter, with the exception of the Acceleration-Deceleration. When assessing the helicopter, the Acceleration-Deceleration is intended to highlight the presence of any undesirable roll due to pitch cross couplings present in the aircraft. As the autogyro uses throttle setting to accelerate, and not pitch attitude, the Acceleration-Deceleration cannot be used to assess the impact of this cross coupling in the autogyro. The Acceleration-Deceleration also revealed the presence of a roll due to throttle coupling in the autogyro which had not previously been reported. Alongside the repetition of this original flight trial, new MTEs were analysed. The Heave Hop and the Roll Step are MTEs originally intended to assess tilt rotor type aircraft; however, they have shown some utility in assessing the autogyro. The Heave Hop in particular highlighted another of the fundamental differences between the autogyro and the helicopter. The Heave Hop is intended to test the ability of the aircraft to sustain a positive load factor, before transitioning to a negative load factor. Much of the effect of this changing load factor is mitigated for the helicopter by the presence of a rotor speed governor, which maintains the rotor speed at a constant value for irrespective of the rotor loading. However, the autogyro rotor is unpowered, meaning that changes in the rotor loading also change the rotor speed. This results in potentially problematic changes in the autogyro handling qualities; reducing or increasing the available control power or quickness available to the pilot. The completion of the work described herein has raised many possible avenues for further work; although it has been shown that ADS- 33 style predicted handling qualities represent a good baseline for development of autogyro specific handling qualities, there remains scope for redefinition of the Level 1 / 2 and Level 2 / 3 boundaries for the predicted handling qualities parameters, such as quickness and control power, as well as for the re-definition of MTEs to make them autogyro-specific. In order to draw absolute conclusions, these manoeuvres must also be reassessed using different autogyro types and configurations – often the work presented herein is only the second time such an assessment has taken place. The development of the easily reconfigurable autogyro model developed as part of this Thesis presents an ideal tool to achieve this goal. In summary, through development of existing work and introduction of new ideas, some progress has been made in the progression towards an autogyro-specific handling qualities specification. Whilst there is still a long way to go in thoroughly domesticating the autogyro, this Thesis represents a step in the right direction...|$|E

By varying the phase of this pitch motion the force can be shifted sidewise or downward. Before blade stall, increasing the amplitude of the pitching kinematics will magnify thrust.|$|R

Change in accreted ice growth with the atmospheric temperature is significant along the <b>blade</b> sections from <b>centre</b> to tip.

40|$|Wind {{turbine blades}} are usually made in batches and then matched in pairs or triples {{to form the}} rotor. This paper {{considers}} matching {{with the aim of}} avoiding or reducing the need for further adjustment of, say, the blade mass. Matching is considered optimal when it minimises the sum of the squared differences in the chosen matching parameter for all blade pairs or triples in a batch. It is proved that use of a simple parameter such as <b>blade</b> mass, or <b>centre</b> of mass, leads to optimal matching by ordering in terms of that parameter. More complex matching based on, say, minimising the eccentricity of the centre of mass, causes the parameter for one blade to depend on at least one other blade. Then ordering does not necessarily produce the optimal matching but, in all cases considered, it comes very close. A branch and bound algorithm is developed for complex matching and is shown to provide the optimal matching in a realistic time for batches of at least 20 blades...|$|R

The reliability and plant efficiency depend on the design conditions of all plant components. Induced draft fans handle high temperature flyash-laden flue gas, and are often plagued by mass-flow deficiencies and excessive vibration in fossil fuel powerplants [1]. In this research an existing induced-draft fan is analysed to investigate the occurrence of high stresses forming on the impeller, as these stresses lead to cracks appearing on the centre plate of the impeller. The basic approach used {{to address this problem}} is implementing the Finite Element Method starting with different cantilever beam configurations to simulate the connection of the <b>blade</b> with the <b>centre</b> plate. Geometries are kept constant to facilitate in the practical set-up implementation stage of the dissertation. The practical set-up is used to verify the results obtained from the Finite Element Method program, and it serves as a benchmark test for evaluating the further use of the chosen Finite Element Method program. A simplified Finite Element Method model is presented for the induced draft fan. Static and frequency analyses are done to determine the characteristics of the fan structure. Lastly an advanced dynamic analysis is done on the specific fan. Different ramp force functions are used to simulate different start-up curves for the fan.

For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as clamps (cramps) either G clamps or spring clamps. A minimum of 4 6inch(150mm) and 10 4inch(100mm) G clamps, plus 20 2 inch(50mm) steel spring clamps is need for ply on frame designs. More is better with clamps. Flat and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads {{and a range of}} replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy.

40|$|A {{numerical}} model of ice friction for the runners of a skeleton sled has been devised. The skeleton runner {{consists of a}} standard stainless steel rod of approximately 16 mm diameter. Two grooves are machined into the trailing half of the runner. The distance between the grooves is approximately 1 mm, giving rise to a spine or <b>blade</b> at the <b>centre</b> of the runner. The skeleton sled has no apparent mechanism for steering. Hence, steering is accomplished by the athlete, using either lateral air drag forces (tilting the helmet), dragging a toe, or by attempting to make {{the spine of the}} runner 2 ̆ 01 cdig into 2 ̆ 01 d the ice more on one side than the other. Until now, the physics of the latter steering mechanism has been poorly understood. It has been assumed that when the spine 2 ̆ 01 cdigs into 2 ̆ 01 d the ice, the ice friction increases. Our {{numerical model}} calculates the details of the contact footprint of the runner on the ice. It also considers frictional heating, heat conduction into the ice and lateral squeeze flow in order to calculate the ice friction coefficient, assuming fully lubricated friction conditions. The model suggests that skeleton sliding can occur in two regimes. The first is one where the sides of the spine do not contact the ice. The second occurs when the spine 2 ̆ 01 cdigs into 2 ̆ 01 d the ice and the sides of the spine contact the ice. By exploring the second regime, we have shown that, as the contact area between the sides of the spine and the ice increases, the ploughing force increases, in accordance with the traditional explanation of steering. However, the shear stress force in the lubricating layer also increases, resulting in a significantly higher ice friction coefficient for the runner with the longer spine contact. This result provides scientific evidence to support the athlete 2 ̆ 019 s experience, that by engaging more of the spine by torqueing the frame of the sled, it is possible to steer the sled, using the differential ice friction on the left and right runners.
