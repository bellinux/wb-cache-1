5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some {{within the field of}} attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit <b>behaviors</b> similar to RAD <b>behaviors.</b> The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused children may exhibit similar <b>behaviors</b> to RAD <b>behaviors</b> but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in foster children, adoptive children, or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem <b>behaviors</b> are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.|$|E
