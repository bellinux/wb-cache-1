40|$|Type- 1 Diabetes {{mellitus}} (T 1 D) {{management is}} important to increase {{the quality of life}} in diabetic children. This research aimed to explore and to compare the parents and children perspective in the quality of life related to T 1 D. Cross sectional method was used to 35 dyad children (8 - 18 years old) and their parents. Children have been registered in top referral hospital in Indonesia. They filled the PedsQL® Module Diabetes 3. 2 by self-report. Data were analyzed by t-test. The characteristic of respondents consist of the children and parents age, length of <b>being</b> <b>diagnoses</b> <b>with</b> T 1 D and the number of visit in the last 6 months.   Quality of life dimensions were measured in the last month since data collected. It consists of sign and symptom, disease and therapy, T 1 D management concern related to complication and communication. The result showed that the children mean age was 13. 11 + 2. 85 years old compared to parents (41. 03 + 8. 34 years old). The average length of <b>being</b> <b>diagnoses</b> <b>with</b> T 1 D was 4. 54 + 2. 87 years and the average number of visit in the last 6 months was 5. 8 + 1. 79. Total score of quality of life from parents and children perspective were 64. 41 % + 10. 97 and 63. 09 % + 13. 25. Moreover, t-test analysis found that there was significant difference in parent perspective compared to the children perspective regarding quality of life related to T 1 D. In conclusion, children have relatively lower perception in evaluating their quality of life in T 1 D compared to the parents. Therefore, it is necessary for nurses to explore the influencing factors as well as coping mechanism related to T 1 D management so that nurses can develop individual nursing plan to increase the T 1 D children's quality of life...|$|R

It was also from Avalon Hill that he ordered the first blank hexagon mapping sheets that were available, which he then employed to design his own games.|$|E

5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{standardized}} diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are <b>being</b> <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.|$|E
