5|$|Although critics panned the novel, Balzac {{remained}} steadfast in his <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{provided an}} important look at philosophy, especially metaphysics. As {{he developed the}} scheme for La Comédie humaine, he placed Louis Lambert in the Études philosophiques section, and later returned to the same themes in his novel Séraphîta, about an androgynous angelic creature.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of a 2016 interdepartmental report into the issue of mental health in the justice system, McEntee stated her <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is unacceptable to send people with mental health issues to prison, and that {{this is an issue that}} must be tackled by the government. She also believes the government should address concerns about the mental health of unemployed young people.|$|E

5|$|Oriel {{has three}} notable pieces of medieval plate. The {{first is a}} French beaker and cover in silver gilt; past {{estimates}} on its dating from 1460–70 are thought mistaken, and circa 1350, with later decoration, was later expounded. It was bought in 1493 for £4.18s.1d., under the mistaken <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had belonged to Edward II. In a college inventory of plate dated 21 December 1596, it is named as the Founder's Cup.|$|E
5|$|Anton was a {{scientist}} in Nazi Germany who, following a disagreement regarding {{the direction of}} its nuclear program, is recruited by the US and flees via France, Spain, and Portugal. He becomes {{a part of the}} Manhattan Project, witnesses the tests, and travels to Hiroshima recording the aftermath. Anton regrets the consequences of the atomic bombs, attends the Pugwash Conference, but maintains his <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was necessary to end the war and prevented more deaths. He marries Sophie and becomes a professor at Columbia University in New York. With Sophie, he retires to a small town outside of Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Universal's conduct {{amounted}} to {{an abuse of}} judicial process, {{and in that sense}} caused a longer harm to the public as a whole. Depending on the commercial results, Universal alternatively argued to the courts, first, that King Kong {{was a part of the}} public domain, and then second, that King Kong was not part of the public domain, and that Universal possessed exclusive trademark rights in it. Universal's assertions in court were based not on any good faith belief in their truth, but on the mistaken <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could use the courts to turn a profit.|$|E

5|$|HIV/AIDS {{has had a}} {{great impact}} on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination. The disease also has large {{economic}} impacts. There are many misconceptions about HIV/AIDS such as the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact. The disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion including the Catholic Church's position not to support condom use as prevention. It has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large-scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|It {{was founded}} in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics taught that {{emotions}} resulted in errors of judgment which were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, and the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy {{as a way of}} life (lex divina), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught that everything was rooted in nature.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} {{has been with}} humans {{since at least the}} Bronze Age. The oldest known {{surgical}} treatise – the Edwin Smith Papyrus, dating to about 1500 BCE – describes a diagnostic test and treatment for a vertebral sprain. Hippocrates (c. 460 BCE – c. 370 BCE) was the first to use a term for sciatic pain and low back pain; Galen (active mid to late second century CE) described the concept in some detail. Physicians {{through the end of the}} first millennium did not attempt back surgery and recommended watchful waiting. Through the Medieval period, folk medicine practitioners provided treatments for back pain based on the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was caused by spirits.|$|E
25|$|Although {{visual art}} is not popular in Somalia due to {{prevailing}} <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> contradicts Islam's proscription on all forms of idolatry, {{a lot of the}} known visual art in the country derives from the small historical town of Merca. Known for its beautiful white sandy beaches and orange dunes, the city's picturesque contrast of colors serves as an inspiration for local visual artists.|$|R

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Why does it strike us as {{absurd to}} believe <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is raining {{and that one}} doesn’t believe <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is raining? Some argue <b>that</b> <b>it</b> strikes us as absurd because belief is normative. The <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is raining and that one doesn’t believe <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is are, it is suggested, self-falsifying. But, so it is argued, it is {{essential}} to <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>beliefs</b> ought not, among other things, be self-falsifying. That is why the beliefs strike us as absurd. I argue that while the absurdity may consist in and be explained by self-falsification, we have no reasons to accept the further claim <b>that</b> self-falsifying <b>beliefs</b> are absurd because violating norms...|$|R
5|$|Many, if not all, {{countries}} have {{some degree of}} polyethnicity, with countries like the United States and Canada having large levels and countries like Japan and Poland having very small levels (and more specifically, a sense of homogeneity). The amount of polyethnicity prevalent in some Western countries has spurred some arguments against it, which include a <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> leads to the weakening of each society's strengths, and also a belief that political-ethnic issues in countries with polyethnic populations are better handled with different laws for certain ethnicities.|$|E
5|$|The Big Bang as {{the origin}} of the {{universe}}: One of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang model is the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{the origin of}} the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not comment about how the universe came into being. Current conception of the Big Bang model assumes the existence of energy, time, and space, and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature initial state of the universe.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, {{the ship}} was {{canceled}} on 11 August 1945, {{when she was about}} 22% complete. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 August 1945. Her incomplete hulk initially was retained on the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{could be used as a}} target in nuclear weapons tests. However, the some $30million it would cost to complete the ship enough to be able to launch her proved too great and the plan was abandoned. She remained in the dockyard until September 1958, when she was broken up on the builder's ways.|$|E
30|$|The GRCS (Raylu and Oei 2004) assesses five gambling-related {{cognition}} domains. The first domain (illusion of control: IC) {{consists of}} <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is possible to}} control gambling outcomes (e.g., believing that superstitious behavior such as playing the slot machine on the aisle side wall could influence gambling outcomes). The second domain (predictive control: PC) consists of <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is possible to predict gambling outcomes based on salient cues (e.g., physical conditions or hunches) or past winning or losing data. The third domain (interpretative bias: IB) involves the reframing of gambling outcomes that encourage continued gambling (e.g., attributing winning to one’s own skill and losing to one’s environment or luck). These first three domains {{are similar to the}} gambling-related cognitions identified by Ladouceur and Walker (1996), Toneatto (1999), and Petry (2005). In addition, the GRCS has two other domains, gambling expectancy (GE) and perceived inability to stop gambling (IS), which are related to the development and maintenance of other addictive behaviors (Engels et al. 2005; Young et al. 2006). Similar to substance-use-related cognitions, gambling expectancy refers to <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> gambling could result in positive benefits (e.g., gambling makes me happier), and the perceived inability to stop gambling refers to beliefs about the sense of helplessness in controlling gambling urges (Raylu and Oei 2004).|$|R
50|$|A {{glittering}} generality (also called glowing generality) is {{an emotionally}} appealing phrase so {{closely associated with}} highly valued concepts and <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> carries conviction without supporting information or reason. Such highly valued concepts attract general approval and acclaim. Their appeal is to emotions such as love of country and home, and desire for peace, freedom, glory, and honor. They ask for approval without examination of the reason. They are typically used by politicians and propagandists.|$|R

5|$|A fire {{swept through}} Westminster in 1834, {{destroying}} {{most of the}} old palace, but the Jewel Tower, which was separated from the main fire and was positioned away from the prevailing wind, survived, along with its store of records from the House of Lords. Westminster was rebuilt, and in 1864 substantial changes were made at the tower: the Parliamentary records in the tower were moved to a fire-proof storage facility at the new Victoria Tower; 6–7 Old Palace Yard ceased {{to be used by}} the clerk as a house, and the kitchen in the ground floor of the tower was closed. Around this time, the tower began to be called the Jewel Tower once again, partially in the incorrect <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had held the Crown Jewels during the medieval period.|$|E
5|$|Before {{moving over}} the mountains, the 20th Division {{headquarters}} elected to destroy its cryptographic materials rather than carry them. As the wet weather made burning them page by page {{a slow and}} difficult process, and a fire might {{attract the attention of}} the Allied Air Forces, someone decided to simply bury them in a steel trunk in a stream bed. An Australian sapper checking the stream bed for booby traps with a metal detector discovered it, and it was dug up in the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a mine. An intelligence officer recognised the contents as code books and soon it {{was on its way to}} the Central Bureau in Brisbane. There, the pages were carefully dried out and photographed. On 4 February 1944, Central Bureau codebreakers decrypted a thirteen-part message that laid out the decisions reached at a conference of high-ranking Japanese officers. Copies of the material were quickly sent to Arlington Hall. In January 1944, Arlington Hall had decrypted 1,846 Japanese army messages. In March 1944, with the Sio code books in hand, it decrypted 36,000 messages.|$|E
5|$|Being common, {{they have}} {{a wide range of}} local names. The older genus name of Buchanga was derived from the Hindi name of Bhujanga. Other local names include Thampal in Pakistan, Gohalo/Kolaho in Baluchistan, Kalkalachi in Sindhi, Kotwal (=policeman) in Hindi; Finga in Bengali; Phenshu in Assamese; Cheiroi in Manipuri; Kosita/ Kalo koshi in Gujarati; Ghosia in Marathi; Kajalapati in Oriya; Kari kuruvi (=charcoal bird), Erettai valan (=two tail) in Tamil; Passala poli gadu in Telugu; Kaaka tampuratti (=queen of crows) in Malayalam; Kari bhujanga in Kannada and Kalu Kawuda in Sinhalese. A superstition in central India is that cattle would lose their horn if a newly fledged bird alighted on it. It is held in reverence in parts of Punjab in the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> brought water to Husayn ibn Ali, revered by Shī‘a Muslims.|$|E

60|$|So large {{an extent}} {{of the field of}} thought is traversed by Hume, in his {{discussion}} of the verbal propositions in which mankind enshrine their <b>beliefs,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be impossible to follow him throughout all the windings of his long journey, within the limits of this essay. I purpose, therefore, to limit myself to those propositions which concern--1. Necessary Truths; 2. The Order of Nature; 3. The Soul; 4. Theism; 5. The Passions and Volition; 6. The Principle of Morals.|$|R
5|$|In the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would be}} {{operated}} by smokeless locomotives, the line {{had been built}} with little ventilation and a long tunnel between Edgware Road and King's Cross. Initially the smoke-filled stations and carriages did not deter passengers and the ventilation was later improved by making {{an opening in the}} tunnel between Gower Street and King's Cross and removing glazing in the station roofs. With the problem continuing after the 1880s, conflict arose between the Met, who wished to make more openings in the tunnels, and the local authorities, who argued that these would frighten horses and reduce property values. This led to an 1897 Board of Trade report, which reported that a pharmacist was treating people in distress after having travelled on the railway with his 'Metropolitan Mixture'. The report recommended more openings be authorised but the line was electrified before these were built.|$|E
5|$|Students in the {{residential}} school system were faced with a multitude of abuses from teachers and administrators, including sexual and physical assault. They suffered from malnourishment and harsh discipline {{that would not have}} been tolerated in any other school system. Corporal punishment was often justified by a <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was the only way to save souls, civilize the savage, or punish and deter runaways – whose injuries or death sustained in their efforts to return home would become the legal responsibility of the school. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, inadequate heating, and a lack of medical care led to high rates of influenza and tuberculosis; in one school, the death rate reached 69%. Federal policies that tied funding to enrollment numbers led to sick children being enrolled in order to boost numbers, thus introducing and spreading disease. The problem of unhealthy children was further exacerbated by the conditions of the schools themselves – overcrowding and poor ventilation, water quality and sewage systems.|$|E
5|$|The only Allied {{military}} forces at Tulagi were 24 commandos from the Australian Army's 2/1st Independent Company, under Captain A. L. Goode, and about 25 personnel from 11 Squadron RAAF, under F/O R. B. Peagam, operating a seaplane base on nearby Gavutu-Tanambogo with four PBY Catalina maritime patrol aircraft. Three Allied coastwatchers were also located nearby, on Guadalcanal island. The {{task of the}} coastwatchers was to report on any enemy movements, or suspicious activity, that they observed {{in the vicinity of}} their stations. In the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might prevent them being executed for espionage, all of the coastwatchers were commissioned as Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve officers, and they were directed by Lieutenant Commander Eric Feldt, who was located at Townsville in Australia.|$|E
40|$|Although Bayesian model {{averaging}} is theoretically {{the optimal}} method for combining learned models, it has seen very little use in machine learning. In this paper we study {{its application to}} combining rule sets, and compare it with bagging and partitioning, two popular but more ad hoc alternatives. Our experiments show that, surprisingly, Bayesian model averaging's error rates are consistently higher than the other methods'. Further investigation shows this {{to be due to}} a marked tendency to overfit on the part of Bayesian model averaging, contradicting previous <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> solves (or avoids) the overfitting problem...|$|R

Alice comes home to her {{apartment}} and <b>it's</b> revealed <b>that</b> Nyla is Alice's daughter and Tangie's sister. Alice gives Nyla the feeble amount of money she made, under the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> for Nyla's college application fees. Meanwhile, Yasmine is walking home from her date with Bill, explaining that she loved dance more than anything until she met Bill ("Now I Love Somebody More Than" [...] cont.).|$|R
50|$|Themes shown {{throughout}} the series include acceptance of different ethnic categories, and expressing the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> {{not what you}} like or your social class that matters, but rather, your personality. The theme of making one's way through adolescence could also be considered {{an aspect of the}} series, as the protagonist struggles to find work, and a home where she can be accepted for who she is and not be pressured into marriage and other issues faced by most young women during the time period in which the books are set.|$|R
