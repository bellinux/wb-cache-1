According to the Gendarmerie, destructions were caused by football ultras infiltrated among peaceful demonstrators. During these days of turmoil, several protesters entered the Romanian Television headquarters to blame the broadcaster for censorship.

500|$|The Derry Housing Action Committee (DHAC) {{was formed}} in March 1968 {{by members of the}} Derry Branch of the Northern Ireland Labour Party and the James Connolly Republican Club, {{including}} Eamonn McCann and Eamon Melaugh. [...] It disrupted a meeting of Londonderry Corporation in March 1968 and in May <b>blocked</b> <b>traffic</b> by placing a caravan that was home to a family of four {{in the middle of the}} Lecky Road in the Bogside and staging a sit-down protest at the opening of the second deck of the Craigavon Bridge. [...] After the meeting of Londonderry Corporation was again disrupted in August, Eamon Melaugh telephoned the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) and invited them to hold a march in Derry. The date chosen was 5 October 1968, an adhoc committee was formed (although in reality most of the organizing was done by McCann and Melaugh) and the route was to take the marchers inside the city walls, where nationalists were traditionally not permitted to march. The Minister of Home Affairs, William Craig, made an order on 3 October prohibiting the march on the grounds that the Apprentice Boys of Derry were intending to hold a march on the same day. [...] In the words of Martin Melaugh of CAIN [...] "this particular tactic...provided the excuse needed to ban the march." [...] When the marchers attempted to defy the ban on 5 October they were stopped by a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) cordon. [...] The police drew their batons and struck marchers, including Stormont MP Eddie McAteer and Westminster MP Gerry Fitt. Subsequently, the police [...] "broke ranks and used their batons indiscriminately on people in Duke Street". Marchers trying to escape met another party of police and [...] "these police also used their batons indiscriminately." [...] Water cannons were also used. The police action caused outrage in the nationalist area of Derry, and at a meeting four days later the Derry Citizens' Action Committee (DCAC) was formed, with John Hume as chairman and Ivan Cooper as vice-chairman.|$|E
