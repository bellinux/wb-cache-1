5|$|A <b>by-election</b> {{need not}} be held to fill a vacancy in any GRC {{triggered}} by the death or resignation of an MP, {{even if there are}} no other minority candidates in that GRC, or any other reason. A <b>by-election</b> is required only if all the MPs in a GRC vacate their Parliamentary seats. Assuming that such a situation does arise, the Prime Minister would be obliged to call a <b>by-election</b> within a reasonable time, unless he intends to call a general election in the near future.|$|E

On 16 June, Rosena Allin-Khan won the <b>by-election</b> in Tooting, with an increased majority. A {{few months after the}} election, Goldsmith also pledged to resign as an MP if the government were to announce plans to build a third runway at Heathrow Airport. Following the decision to build the runway, Goldsmith stood-down as MP for Richmond Park, triggering a <b>by-election,</b> in which Goldsmith stood as an independent candidate. On 1 December 2016, Goldsmith, was defeated in the <b>by-election</b> by Sarah Olney of the Liberal Democrats, with Goldsmith's loss put down to his stance in favour of Britain's exit from the European Union.|$|E

5|$|By late January 2006, campaigning {{was under}} way for the Dunfermline and West Fife <b>by-election,</b> 2006 {{scheduled}} to take place for the Westminster constituency in which {{the north end of}} the bridge is situated. The <b>by-election,</b> scheduled for 9 February, was contested by – in addition to the major political parties in Scotland – an Abolish Forth Bridge Tolls Party. It was won by Liberal Democrat candidate Willie Rennie, overturning a large Labour majority on a 16% swing. In the aftermath of the <b>by-election</b> defeat, media speculation suggested the Executive had turned against the proposals, and Tavish Scott eventually confirmed their rejection and the retention of the existing toll structure on 1 March 2006. FETA condemned the decision, while local opposition MSPs charged the minister that his tolling review short-changed Fifers as tolls were axed on the Erskine Bridge leaving tolls on only the Forth and Tay Road Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{where an}} MP {{of the ruling}} party vacates his or her seat, a {{counterpart}} in a neighbouring ward may take over his or her functions, thus {{eliminating the need for}} a <b>by-election.</b> However, this arrangement may not work if an opposition MP vacates his or her seat and no <b>by-election</b> is called, because of the dearth of opposition MPs in Parliament. Therefore, the voters in the opposition ward will be denied of representation until the next general election.|$|E
