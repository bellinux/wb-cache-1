2500|$|In [...] Ferrari's new car, the F1/86 {{designed}} by Harvey Postlethwaite, {{proved to be}} slower and less reliable than its predecessor as Alboreto retired from a total of nine races: only two of those retirements are counted as driver error while the remaining seven were mechanical failures. Alboreto only scored one podium, at the Austrian Grand Prix – even then both Williams cars of Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet had retired and Alboreto finished a full lap behind race winner Alain Prost. The Italian finished the season ninth in the Divers' Championship with fourteen points. While the Ferrari V6 turbo was rated {{as one of the}} more powerful engines on the grid, both Alboreto and team mate Stefan Johansson were hampered by the F1/86 which refused to handle on tracks which had a <b>bumpy</b> <b>surface.</b> Johansson finished 5th in the championship with 23 points despite being the #2 driver in the team, causing many to question why the team chose to re-sign Alboreto and let Johansson go.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the season}} various {{additions}} and modifications {{were made to}} the FW30's aerodynamic appendages. The design of the front wing bridge was tweaked slightly from the 2008 Turkish Grand Prix onward. The bridge element gained two small airflow [...] "fences" [...] that allowed the Williams aerodynamic team to extend the depth of the wing profile. This resulted in an increase in the aerodynamic downforce generated by the wing, without a concomitant increase in drag. Later in the season, prior to the 2008 German Grand Prix, Williams also altered the lower front wing elements, offering their drivers a choice of drag-reducing flap tweaks to the rearmost element. The bumps expected at the new Marina Bay Street Circuit, used for the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, prompted Williams to tweak the design of the front wing yet again. On this occasion the central [...] "spoon profile" [...] was given a more rounded aspect, in place of the rather more squared-off design used to this point. The change in profile reduced downforce slightly, but resulted in the FW30 being significantly less sensitive to the changes in ride height expected as the cars negotiated the <b>bumpy</b> <b>surface.</b> For the final race of the season, the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, Williams again tweaked the profile of the main and middle elements of the front wing. Small curved steps were added to the outer extremities of these elements to increase the speed of airflow through the wing tip, increasing downforce without increasing drag.|$|E

30|$|The {{physical}} {{characteristics of the}} walking surface are important elements for an individual {{in the process of}} path selection in the outdoor environment. Pedestrians usually prefers stiff, dense and smooth surfaces over loose, soft and uneven <b>bumpy</b> <b>surfaces</b> as they can support their weight during the mobility process and provide ease of travel at a normal speed. The Lejeune et al. [69] study shows that walking on loose-soil surfaces such as sand requires 2.1 – 2.7 times more human energy expenditure than walking on solid ground at the same speed. Furthermore, Haisman and Goldman [70] stated that the human energy expenditure while walking on difficult terrains and thick bushes may overwhelm human physiological limits in comparison to walking on the smooth surfaces. Walking on rough, uneven and <b>bumpy</b> <b>surfaces</b> requires more energy than walking on a smooth surface. The previous study showed that the cost of walking over rough and <b>bumpy</b> <b>surfaces,</b> such as ploughed fields, is 50  % greater than walking on a smooth surface [64].|$|R

Generation of low-frequency ground vibrations by heavy lorries is considered theoretically for both vehicles accelerating (decelerating) with a constant accelerotion and vehicles travelling at constant speed on damaged or <b>bumpy.</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In the case of damaged or <b>bumpy</b> <b>surfaces,</b> excitation of axle-hop reson(tnces is taken into account, whereas an accelerating or braking vehicle is modelled as a point horizontal tractionforce applied to the ground and moving along with the vehicle. Frequency spectra of the vertical component of the groundvibrationvelociQ are investigatedfor dffirentfunctions of road surface roughness, acceleration,final (initial) speed ofthe vehicle, ground attenuation, Poisson's ratio, and radiation angle relative to the direction of the vehicle moveruent. It is shown that damaged or <b>bumpy</b> road <b>surfaces</b> normally generate vibrcttions of higher amplitudes, in comparison with accelerating and braking lorries. In contrast to vehicles travelling along bumpy or uneven roads and generating vibrations propagating at all directions, the ground vibrations generated by accelerating and braking vehicles are characterised by the directivity function showing that there is no radiation in the direction perpendicular to the vehicle movement...|$|R

5000|$|Like all V8-powered E39 models, the E39 M5 was {{equipped}} with a recirculating ball steering system, regarded as less tactile than the rack and pinion set up of other E39s. Overall steering ratio was reduced to 14.7 from 17.9. It featured a Servotronic vehicle-speed-sensitive power assist which provides two levels of resistance controlled via console mounted Sport button. The Sport button also adjusted the electronic throttle butterflies for faster throttle response.

40|$|Lack of {{considering}} aging phenomena observed {{frequently in the}} real world gives rise to unreal synthetic objects. Aging effects are viewed {{to play an important role}} in achieving seamless superposition of synthetic objects upon acquired natural scenes. Several research groups have noticed the importance of such effects, and recently reported attractive results. The primary target in this paper is weathering of stones. Stones are quite common building material; weathering also needs its specific phenomenological modeling method. Stone objects start to get eroded on their surface interacting with the open air, leading to <b>bumpy</b> <b>surfaces</b> and rounded corners. In order to simulate such effects visually, mathematical morphology (MM) -based volumetric metamorphosis is adopted. An effective morphological operator, termed weathering is devised by extending the conventional 3 D opening, MM operator with stochastic structuring elements. Preliminary experiments are performed with simply-shaped stone objects to illustrate the effectiveness of the present technique...|$|R

2500|$|When activated, some earlier ABS systems {{caused the}} brake pedal to pulse noticeably. As most drivers rarely {{or do not}} brake hard enough to cause brake lock-up, and drivers {{typically}} do not read the vehicle's owners manual, {{this may not be}} noticeable until an emergency. Some manufacturers have therefore implemented a brake assist system that determines that the driver is attempting a [...] "panic stop" [...] (by detecting that the brake pedal was depressed very fast, unlike a normal stop where the pedal pressure would usually be gradually increased, Some systems additionally monitor the rate at the accelerator was released) and the system automatically increases braking force where not enough pressure is applied. Hard or panic braking on <b>bumpy</b> <b>surfaces,</b> because of the bumps causing the speed of the wheel(s) to become erratic may also trigger the ABS, sometimes causing the system to enter its ice mode, where the system severely limits maximum available braking power. Nevertheless, ABS significantly improves safety and control for drivers in most on-road situations.|$|R

The third type occurs on drowned reefs, exhibiting a mixture of Pleistocene shallow water and present day deep water binding species. Therefore, the morphology of this subfacies is more governed by an inherited relief, characterized by pinnacles and barrel shaped towers. This present day deep water foralgal community started to develop within the Cretaceous in shallow water environments, composed predominantly of corallinaceans, peyssonneliaceans, and subordinately of acervulinid foraminifera. With {{the beginning of the}} Neogene, the shallow water community of reef binding foraminifera and calcareous algae changed and become dominated by the foraminifera Acervulina.
