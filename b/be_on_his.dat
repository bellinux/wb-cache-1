5|$|By mid-September, Grant warned Boutwell to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> guard as {{the gold}} price {{continued}} to rise, while the conspirators bought ever more {{and the rising}} price affected the wider economy. Grant, seeing that the increase was unnatural, told Boutwell to sell gold, which reduced its price. Boutwell did so the next day, on September 24, 1869, later known as Black Friday. The sale of gold from the Treasury defeated Gould's scheme as the gold price plummeted, relieving the economic tension. This caused a mild recession, but by January 1870, the economy resumed its post-war recovery. Gould and Fisk managed to escape without much harm to themselves. A Congressional investigation followed, chaired by James A. Garfield and cleared Grant of wrongdoing, but excoriated Gould and Fisk for their manipulation of the gold market and Corbin for exploiting his personal connection to Grant.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning {{on a table}} in an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the group}} {{performed}} at a music festival {{held by the}} Dakar French Cultural Center, where the French rapper MC Solaar heard their performance and invited the group to open {{for him when he}} debuted in Dakar in October of that year. The rapper was impressed with Positive Black Soul, inviting them to continue performing with him in France. Two years later the group put out its first release, a cassette entitled Boul Falé. The album was followed by more touring in France, as well as in England and Switzerland. In the same year, the Senegalese musician Baaba Maal offered PBS the opportunity to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> album Firin' in Fouta. Maal was signed to Mango Records and because of this recording with him, Positive Black Soul were signed as well. They released their album debut Salaam on Mango Records. After achieving success in Senegal and some abroad, the group continued touring, including 130 performances in 1997. They also began organizing concerts in Dakar and promoting new groups including Daara J and Pee Froiss.|$|E

5|$|Victoria Cross {{recipient}} Cecil Meritt {{cited the}} fact that he already held Canada's highest decoration as a reason not to be admitted to the Order of Canada. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was in 1982 offered appointment to the order as an honorary Companion; however, he refused on the grounds that, as the consort of the Queen, he was a Canadian and thus entitled to a substantive appointment. In 1993, the Advisory Council proposed an amendment to the constitution of the Order of Canada, making the sovereign's spouse automatically a Companion, but Prince Philip again refused, stating that if he was to be appointed, it should <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> merits. Congruent with these arguments, he in 1988 accepted without issue a substantive induction as a Companion of the Order of Australia. In 2013, the constitution of the Order of Canada was amended in a way that permitted the substantive appointment of Royal Family members and Prince Philip accepted induction as the first extraordinary Companion of the Order of Canada on 26 April 2013. Former Premier of Newfoundland Joey Smallwood declined appointment as a Companion because he felt that, as a self-proclaimed Father of Confederation, he deserved a knighthood. Smallwood was never knighted and later accepted induction as a Companion.|$|E

However, he would remain in Milan for two seasons.|$|E
25|$|After {{a loss to}} the Chicago Bulls on Christmas Day, the Nets {{dropped to}} a disappointing 9–19 record.

However, the Nets were able to turn things around at the beginning of 2014 and finished the season with a 44-38 record, while Kidd began to get recognition for his coaching skills.|$|E

She unselfishly does what others expect of her, doing things like helping Charley escape their father to go to school, and living with Jenny Wren. Marrying Wrayburn is the only truly selfish act Lizzie commits in Our Mutual Friend, and even that is debatable, since she only did it because Wrayburn appeared to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> deathbed.|$|E
25|$|By 1983, LJN Toys had {{attained}} $51 {{million in}} sales and {{attracted the attention of}} MCA Inc., which was at the time the parent company of Universal Studios. MCA had been acquiring many companies during the mid-1980s, and had a particular interest in acquiring toy companies. In 1985, MCA acquired a 63 percent interest in LJN Toys, completing a $32 million stock deal that required Friedman to move to Los Angeles County, California. Friedman signed a long-term employment agreement with MCA and began running LJN Toys from southern California. Friedman was an avid movie fan, and had considered producing films, but after two years and just before MCA sold LJN to Acclaim Entertainment, Friedman left the company, preferring to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own in the business world.|$|E

25|$|Soon after {{returning}} from France, Jefferson accepted Washington's invitation to serve as Secretary of State. Jefferson had initially expected to return to France, but Washington insisted that he <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> new Cabinet. Pressing issues at this time were the national debt and the permanent location of the capital. Jefferson opposed a national debt, preferring that each state retire its own, in contrast to Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, who desired consolidation of various states' debts by the federal government. Hamilton also had bold plans to establish the national credit and a national bank, but Jefferson strenuously opposed this and attempted to undermine his agenda, which nearly led Washington to dismiss him from his cabinet. Jefferson later left the cabinet voluntarily; Washington never forgave him, and never spoke to him again.|$|E
25|$|Newell {{started his}} summer {{spending}} by quickly securing Barry Conlon and Joe Widdowson {{on a permanent}} basis. Paul Linwood was brought in from Chester City, should hugely targeted Ryan Bennett <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> way, but after rejecting two offers from Peterborough United, the club tied the young skipper on an improved 4-year contract. Newell also managed to bring in former loan players Adrian Forbes and Peter Sweeney, as well as Nick Colgan, Michael Leary and Chris Jones to finish his squad refurbishing. The Mariners had a mixed pre-season, consisting of a 12–1 thrashing of Winterton Rangers, a creditable 1–1 draw with Leeds United, as well as losses to Stockport and Doncaster. Season Ticket sales for the 2009–10 campaign had smashed through the previous season's sales, adding up to around 2,500 tickets, a creditable total considering the economic climate.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ensuing}} kickoff, the Browns {{got the ball}} on their own 25-yard line. Byner started out the drive with a 16-yard burst and a 2-yard run, and then Kosar {{completed}} two passes to Brennan for 33 total yards. Following an encroachment penalty on defensive lineman Andre Townsend and a 6-yard run by Byner, an offsides penalty on Denver linebacker Karl Mecklenburg moved {{the ball to the}} Broncos 8-yard line with 1:12 remaining in regulation. The Browns had moved 67 yards in just six plays covering 2:41. On the next play, Byner took a handoff and appeared to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> way to score the game-tying touchdown. But he was stripped of the ball by Broncos defensive back Jeremiah Castille, and fumbled at the 2-yard line. The Broncos recovered the fumble (Castille made the recovery), gave the Browns an intentional safety, and went on to win 38–33.|$|E
