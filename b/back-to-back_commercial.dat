She then portrayed the lead female role in Atlee's Theri, and featured alongside Vijay {{for the second time}} in her career. Her performance received positive reviews, with a critic from DNA India stating [...] "Samantha looks pretty as always" [...] and that [...] "she has done an incredible job in dubbing with a range of emotions in her numerous shades - doctor, lover, mother - and she shines". Likewise, Behindwoods.com stated that Theri [...] "could be one of Samantha’s best roles; she plays a doctor and has given out a soulful performance". The film went on to become of the most profitable Tamil films of all time, upon release, and ended a barren spell for the actress in Tamil cinema, by becoming her first commercially successful film in Tamil cinema since Kaththi (2014). Samantha then worked for a second time with director Vikram Kumar and Suriya in the critically acclaimed, fantasy film 24.

50|$|The spacing {{effect and}} its {{underlying}} mechanisms have important applications {{to the world}} of advertising. For instance, the spacing effect dictates that it is not an effective advertising strategy to present the same <b>commercial</b> <b>back-to-back</b> (massed repetition). If encoding variability is an important mechanism of the spacing effect, then a good advertising strategy might include a distributed presentation of different versions of the same ad.|$|R
50|$|Burley {{grew from}} {{a village in}} the late {{industrial}} revolution. Parts of the original village can still be seen at the junction of Burley Road and Haddon Road, and around Burley Lodge. Most houses constructed in Burley were of red-brick, but were generally smaller and largely <b>back-to-backs.</b> Industrial and <b>commercial</b> buildings were also largely brick-built. There are some larger stone-built buildings on Kirkstall Road such as the ornate Cardigan Arms public house—although this largely pre-dates most of the buildings in the area—which {{at the time of}} its construction only Burley Village existed, with the Arms somewhat outside.|$|R

If encoding variability is an important mechanism of the spacing effect, then a good advertising strategy might include a distributed presentation of different versions of the same ad. Appleton-Knapp, Bjork and Wickens (2005) examined the effects of spacing on advertising. They found that spaced repetitions of advertisements are more affected by study-phase retrieval processes than encoding variability. They also found that at long intervals, varying the presentation of a given ad is not effective in producing higher recall rates among subjects (as predicted by variable encoding). Despite this finding, recognition is not affected by variations in an ad at long intervals.|$|R
