40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{evolution}} of <b>business</b> <b>start-ups</b> {{in the first three}} to five years. Evolution is defined here as a non-continuous learning process of entrepreneurs that creates and changes organizational routines. Two concepts are central: critical learning episodes and pathways. Critical learning episodes are discontinuous learning events in the storyline of these <b>business</b> <b>start-ups.</b> A critical learning episode is composed of endogenous or exoge-nous events that trigger search activities to acquire or create resources, which, when applied to the firm, will change the current organizational routines. Pathways are arrangements of critical learning episodes. This study develops a multidisciplinary analytical framework with concepts of learning from organizational psychology, concepts of the internal dynamics of firms for the Penrosian resource-based theory, and concepts of economic change from evolutionary economics. This thesis fills in the gap of describing evolutionary and learning processes of <b>business</b> <b>start-ups</b> in the resource-based theory of the firm. The research question about how learning-based pathways explain {{the evolution of}} <b>business</b> <b>start-ups</b> was investigated through semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurs of 43 <b>business</b> <b>start-ups.</b> All these start-ups were linked to business incubation programmes in the two most resource-rich regions of Brazil: São Paulo and Minas Gerais.

40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} {{the success of}} publicly supported <b>business</b> <b>start-ups</b> by comparing the outcomes of various support measures.

While start-up measures possibly could aim at different kinds of eff ects, our focus is on the effect on subsequent firm growth. The analysis is based on a survey conducted in 2005. The sample was drawn from a highly heterogeneous population of <b>business</b> <b>start-ups.</b> By using propensity score exact matching for success measurement we try to capture those differences. <b>Business</b> <b>start-ups,</b> public policy, public support, matching...|$|R
