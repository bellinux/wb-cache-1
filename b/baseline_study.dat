The study focused on a designated area off the coast to determine the current distribution, abundance and migratory patterns of avian species, fish, marine resources and sea turtle use of the existing ecological resources. The results of the study were released in June 2010. The study concluded that the effects of developing offshore windfarms would be negligible.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2009 press conference, the Catholic Diocese of the {{department}} of San Marcos presented the results of a two-year study they carried out of the quality of surface waters surrounding Marlin Mine. The press conference was held in Guatemala City, and was attended by environmental activists, human rights activists, mining personnel, and members of the public. The study found that surface water used by community members in San Miguel Ixtahuacán for crop irrigation, herd animals, and human consumption, has been contaminated by heavy metals such as arsenic and copper. The levels of these heavy metals exceed Guatemalan standards, international World Health Organization standards, and standards set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water. The study explained the specific steps taken to test the water, and has been [...] in Spanish, and in [...] [...] However, the study did not compare its findings to historical metals levels in the rivers, which were shown in the <b>baseline</b> <b>study</b> to have naturally high metals levels, which exceeded guidelines for certain uses, including drinking water, prior to the existence of the mining operation.|$|E

50|$|Multiple <b>baseline</b> <b>studies</b> {{are often}} {{categorized}} as either concurrent or nonconcurrent. Concurrent designs are {{the traditional approach}} to multiple <b>baseline</b> <b>studies,</b> where all participants undergo treatment simultaneously. This strategy is advantageous because it moderates several threats to validity, and history effects in particular. Concurrent multiple baseline designs are also useful for saving time, since all participants are processed at once. The ability to retrieve complete data sets within well defined time constraints is a valuable asset while planning research.|$|R
