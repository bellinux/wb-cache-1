An example is the brown soil zone in the semi-arid marginal land area of the south-western Canadian prairies known as Palliser's Triangle, which is not well-suited to the growth of crops like canola.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the role of the}} state in the emerging bio-economy. The starting point is that state interventions, including supportive regulatory arrangements and the shaping of public attitudes, constitute core assets in the evolution of <b>bio-industrial</b> complexes. Public policy in the bio-economy, across advanced industrial countries, is well captured by the “competition state” concept. This type of state takes different forms, analogously with the historical variants of the Keynesian welfare state. The article compares patterns of governance of the biotechnology sector in Finland and Sweden, the USA and the UK, and Australia. It is concluded that the bio-industry sector does not fit with the “models of capitalism” paradigm which postulates coherence within, and systemic divergences between, national models of economic governance. The bio-economy displays trends toward convergence, in particular mounting public investments in health care and in research and development. On the other hand, countries differ in their approach to market regulation, industrial support, and ethical restrictions. These differences do not follow the dichotomy between “liberal” and “coordinated” models of capitalism. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Construction of new {{highways}} {{can lead}} to challenges when attempting to re-establish vegetation on right-of-ways. Lack of vegetation can leave soil exposed and subject to increased runoff and soil erosion. Therefore, the Iowa Department of Transportation and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources sponsored a study {{to evaluate the use}} of composts applied as mulch blankets to decrease runoff and erosion. This article evaluates interrill runoff and erosion between three types of compost (biosolids, yard waste, and <b>bio-industrial</b> byproducts) and two soil conditions (existing compacted subsoil (control) and imported topsoil) on a 3 : 1 highway embankment. Composts were applied as 5 and 10 cm blankets {{on the surface of the}} control, and topsoil was placed on the surface of the control at a depth of 15 cm. Treatments were replicated six times over a two-year period for both bare soil and six weeks following planting of an Iowa DOT-specified cover crop. Rainfall was applied at an average intensity of 95 mm h- 1 using a rainfall simulator, and sampling was conducted for 1 h after runoff began. All compost treatments were effective at reducing interrill erosion rates under the conditions simulated in this study. In addition, the three compost media required 30 min or longer to produce runoff, while the two conventional soils produced runoff within the first 8 min. The depth of compost application was only a factor for the runoff rate on unvegetated treatments. In this case, the 5 cm depth had a significantly greater runoff rate than the 10 cm depth. Both 5 and 10 cm compost applications had similar effects on interrill erosion rates. Although the steady-state interrill erosion rates of all three composts were 3 % to 24 % of the steady-state interrill erosion rates of the two soils on unvegetated treatments, and 0. 1 % to 30 % of the steady-state interrill erosion rates of the two soils on vegetated treatments, the type of compost was also a factor in interrill erosion control. The yard waste compost was the coarsest of the three compost materials, and on unvegetated plots had a steady-state interrill erosion rate that was 17 % and 33 % of the steady-state interrill erosion rates of biosolids and <b>bio-industrial</b> compost, respectively.

30|$|Engineering {{multi-domain}} {{enzymes that}} {{are capable of}} catalyzing two or more reactions is a potential strategy to reduce enzyme costs in <b>bio-industrial</b> processes, as multiple catalytic properties on a single polypeptide conceivably simplify production and purification operations of biochemicals (Ribeiro et al. 2011). Similarly, the cost-effective optimization of chimeras to prevent unproductive competition between functionally similar enzymes by testing the importance of both the positions of enzymes and CBMs for an efficient use in bioprocessing industries is necessary, though demanding a vigorous investigation. However, the successful expression of the essential cellulolytic enzymes (i.e., endoglucanases, exoglucanases, and β-glucosidases) on a single peptide chain, in a processive order, such that their proportionate quantities favor maximum hydrolysis efficiency has been highly challenging (Tozakidis et al. 2016). Also, the determination of simple and reliable structural organization of the chimeric domains has been a significant drawback in the construction of a protein chimera, but the advent of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) with flexible analytical models (e.g., molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo simulations) has provided not only successful computational data validation approaches, but also accurate fitting of the scattering profile due to their potential to explore the protein conformation in space (Cota et al. 2013).|$|E

Thus it is regarded as a model crop for energy plants. Genetic map construction is the foundation for marker-assisted selection and gene cloning. So far several sorghum linkage maps have been reported using different kinds of molecular markers. However marker numbers and chromosome coverage are limited. As a result, it is difficult to get consistent results and the maps are hard to unify. In the present study, the genomes of 130 individuals consisting an F 2 population together with their parents were surveyed using a high-throughput sequencing technique. A high-density linkage map was constructed using specific-locus amplified fragments (SLAF) markers. This map can provide information and serve as a reference for effective gene exploration, and for marker assisted-breeding program.

Effective siting and feedstock procurement strategies are critical to the development and implementation of bioenergy systems. This paper aims to improve spatial decision-support in this domain by shifting focus from homogenous (forestry or agricultural) regions toward heterogeneous regions—i. e., areas with a presence of both forestry and agricultural activities; in this case, eastern Ontario, Canada. Multiple land-cover and resource map series are integrated in order to produce a spatially distributed GIS-based model of resource availability. These data are soft-linked with spreadsheet-based linear models in order to estimate and compare the quantity and supply-cost of the full range of non-food bioenergy feedstock available to a prospective developer, and to assess the merits of a mixed feedstock stream relative to a homogenous feedstock stream. The method is applied to estimate bioenergy production potentials and biomass supply-cost curves for a number of cities in the study region. Comparisons of biomass catchment areas; supply-cost curves; resource density maps; and resource flow charts demonstrate considerable strategic and operational advantages to locating a facility within the region’s “transition zone” between forestry and agricultural activities.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{industrial}} {{large scale}} bio-reactions micro-organisms are generally {{exposed to a}} variety of environmental stresses, which might be detrimental for growth and productivity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role among the common stress factors [...] directly [...] through incomplete reduction of O(2) during respiration, or indirectly [...] caused by other stressing factors. Vitamin C or L-ascorbic acid acts as a scavenger of ROS, thereby potentially protecting cells from harmful oxidative products. While most eukaryotes synthesize ascorbic acid, yeast cells produce erythro-ascorbic acid instead. The actual importance of this antioxidant substance for the yeast is still a subject of scientific debate. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We set out to enable Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to produce ascorbic acid intracellularly to protect the cells from detrimental effects of environmental stresses. We report {{for the first time the}} biosynthesis of L-ascorbic acid from D-glucose by metabolically engineered yeast cells. The amount of L-ascorbic acid produced leads to an improved robustness of the recombinant cells when they are subjected to stress conditions as often met during industrial fermentations. Not only resistance against oxidative agents as H(2) O(2) is increased, but also the tolerance to low pH and weak organic acids at low pH is increased. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This platform provides a new tool whose commercial applications may have a substantial impact on <b>bio-industrial</b> production of Vitamin C. Furthermore, we propose S. cerevisiae cells endogenously producing vitamin C as a cellular model to study the genesis/protection of ROS as well as genotoxicity...|$|E

A tier 1 quantification of triticale hybridization was conducted by emasculating and hand pollinating flowers un-der greenhouse conditions. Approximately 2000 manual pollinations were conducted for each cross and its reciprocal between two triticale genotypes: a modern triticale cultivar (AC Alta) and primary triticale (89 TT 108), and common wheat, durum wheat and rye. The frequency of outcrossing, hybrid seed appearance and weight, and F 1 emergence and fertility were recorded. Outcrossing, F 1 emergence and fertility rates were high from crosses between triticale genotypes.

40|$|While public {{policies}} advocate national blood-donation systems based on voluntary non-remunerated donation, current scholarship has questioned the contemporary relevance of this gift-model. Technical innovations, such as blood-fractioning, allow a donated blood-unit {{to be broken}} down into different components {{that can be used for}} multiple purposes, ranging from transfusion medicine over the manufacturing of plasma-derived medicinal products to human genome research in both public and private <b>bio-industrial</b> contexts. As techno-scientific processing renders blood an increasing biovalue after donation, non-economic blood-donation has been integrated in a global network of bio-economic relations. This has urged scholars to reflect on the shifting meanings and values of blood and blood-donation within a globalized blood-economy. This paper contrasts different conceptualizations of donor-blood in social science research on blood-donation. While some authors stress the metaphorical, moral or social value of donated blood, others argue that the techno-scientific and partially marketized deployment of donor-blood turned it into a bulk-commodity and that, subsequently, a volunteer-based system for blood collection is outdated. Taking these divergent perspectives into account, this paper suggests an ontological approach towards the materiality of blood and its multiple meanings and values. By mapping out the flow of Flemish donor-blood, we explore where and how different ontologies of blood are enacted in practice. The Flemish Red Cross blood-bank is thereby identified as a strategic site in the co-ordination of different practice-specific enactments of blood, bracketing out conflicting versions of donor-blood in their communication towards (potential) voluntary non-remunerated donors on blood-donation as ‘a gift of life’...|$|E

Composted organics are viewed as an alternative approach to improve construction site soils and to reduce runoff and soil erosion. The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate the use of blanket-applied composted organics on rill erosion as compared to soils. Rill erosion was measured on three composted organics applied at 5 and 10 cm depths, a topsoil treatment (15 cm application), and the existing soil (control) on a highway embankment with a three-to-one sideslope (33 %). Treatments were tested using rainfall simulation at a target rate of 100 mm/h and simultaneously adding five inflows at the top of the rill on both vegetated and unvegetated plots. Rill erosion on blanket-applied compost treatments was measured, and the usefulness of the shear stress model for predicting rill erosion on compost-treated areas was assessed. Rill erodibilities and critical shear values were calculated for all treatments using the shear stress model that was originally developed for soil. Rill erodibilities were higher on topsoil-treated plots than on control and compost-treated areas. Yard waste had significantly lower rill erodibility than all other compost and soil treatments. There were no significant differences between critical shear values for the composts and soil. Yard waste compost exhibited greater resistance to rill formation than the biosolids and <b>bio-industrial</b> composts or the two soils. Low R 2 values for compost erodibility and critical shear suggest that the shear stress model used in this analysis is not well suited for use with composted organics. Detachment caused by flotation of low-density particles, and bridging caused by coarse particles lodging farther down the slope, are believed to be two rill erosion mechanisms in compost that the shear stress model does not adequately address...|$|E

Two analyses {{were carried out}} to evaluate the influence of additional services and externalities on Emergy indicators for a pyrolysis plant unit able to process 1000 kg of dry biomass per hour. The initial approach was a traditional Emergy assessment in which financial fluxes and externalities were not considered. The second approach included taxes and fees of the Brazilian government, interests related to financing operations and assumes a reserve financial fund of 5 % of the total investment as externalities cost. For the first evaluation, the renewability of 86 % indicates that local and renewable resources mainly support {{the process and the}} Emergy Yield Ratio of 3. 2 shows that the system has a potential contribution to the regional economy due to the local resources use. The inclusion of financial fluxes and externalities in the second evaluation reduces both renewability and Emergy Yield Ratio, whereas it increases the Emergy Investment Ratio which means a higher dependence on external resources. The second analysis allows portraying significant forces of the industrial and financial systems and the evaluation of the externalities' impact on the general system Emergy behavior. A comparison of the renewability of water hyacinth fast pyrolysis with other biofuels like soybean biodiesel and sugarcane ethanol indicates that the former is less dependent on fossil fuel resources, machinery and fertilizers. To complement the sustainability assessment provided by the Emergy method, a regular financial analysis for the second defined system was done. It shows that the system is financially attractive even with the accounting of additional costs.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{infection}} and virulence functions of diverse {{plant and animal}} pathogens that possess quorum sensing systems are regulated by N -acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) acting as signal molecules. AHL-acylase is a quorum quenching enzyme and degrades AHLs by removing the fatty acid side chain from the homoserine lactone ring of AHLs. This blocks AHL accumulation and pathogenic phenotypes in quorum sensing bacteria. Results An aac gene of undemonstrated function from Ralstonia solanacearum GMI 1000 was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli; it inactivated four AHLs that were tested. The sequence of the 795 amino acid polypeptide was considerably similar to the AHL-acylase from Ralstonia sp. XJ 12 B with 83 % identity match and shared 39 % identity with an aculeacin A acylase precursor from the gram-positive actinomycete Actinoplanes utahensis. Aculeacin A is a neutral lipopeptide antibiotic and an antifungal drug. An electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis verified that Aac hydrolysed the amide bond of AHL, releasing homoserine lactone and the corresponding fatty acids. However, ESI-MS analysis demonstrated that the Aac could not catalyze the hydrolysis of the palmitoyl moiety of the aculeacin A. Moreover, the results of MIC test of aculeacin A suggest that Aac could not deacylate aculeacin A. The specificity of Aac for AHLs showed a greater preference for long acyl chains than for short acyl chains. Heterologous expression of the aac gene in Chromobacterium violaceum CV 026 effectively inhibited violacein and chitinase activity, {{both of which were}} regulated by the quorum-sensing mechanism. These results indicated that Aac could control AHL-dependent pathogenicity. Conclusion This is the first study to find an AHL-acylase in a phytopathogen. Our data provide direct evidence that the functioning of the aac gene (NP 520668) of R. solanacearum GMI 1000 is via AHL-acylase and not via aculeacin A acylase. Since Aac is a therapeutic potential quorum-quenching agent, its further biotechnological applications in agriculture, clinical and <b>bio-industrial</b> fields should be evaluated in the near future. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: N-Butanol has {{favorable}} characteristics for use {{as either}} an alternative fuel or platform chemical. Bio-based n-butanol production using microbes is an emerging technology that requires further development. Although <b>bio-industrial</b> microbes such as Escherichia coli have been engineered to produce n-butanol, reactive oxygen species (ROS) -mediated toxicity may limit productivity. Previously, we show that outer-membrane-targeted tilapia metallothionein (OmpC-TMT) is more effective as an ROS scavenger than human and mouse metallothioneins to reduce oxidative stress in the host cell. Results: The host strain (BUT 1 -DE) containing the clostridial n-butanol pathway displayed a decreased growth rate and limited n-butanol productivity, likely due to ROS accumulation. The clostridial n-butanol pathway was co-engineered with inducible OmpC-TMT in E. coli (BUT 3 -DE) for simultaneous ROS removal, {{and its effect on}} n-butanol productivity was examined. The ROS scavenging ability of cells overexpressing OmpC-TMT was examined and showed an approximately twofold increase in capacity. The modified strain improved n-butanol productivity to 320 mg/L, whereas the control strain produced only 95. 1 mg/L. Transcriptomic analysis revealed three major KEGG pathways that were significantly differentially expressed in the BUT 3 -DE strain compared with their expression in the BUT 1 -DE strain, including genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, fructose and mannose metabolism and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Conclusions: These results indicate that OmpC-TMT can increase n-butanol production by scavenging ROS. The transcriptomic analysis suggested that n-butanol causes quinone malfunction, resulting in oxidative-phosphorylation-related nuo operon downregulation, which would diminish the ability to convert NADH to NAD(+) and generate proton motive force. However, fructose and mannose metabolism-related genes (fucA, srlE and srlA) were upregulated, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis-related genes (pfkB, pgm) were downregulated, which further assisted in regulating NADH/NAD(+) redox and preventing additional ATP depletion. These results indicated that more NADH and ATP were required in the n-butanol synthetic pathway. Our study demonstrates a potential approach to increase the robustness of microorganisms and the production of toxic chemicals through the ability to reduce oxidative stress...|$|E

In this study, mouse ear tumors were employed to investigate the therapeutic effects of US, MBs, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) on tumors. Tumors started to receive treatments when they grew up to about 15 mm 3 (early stage) with injection of PLD 10 mg/kg, or up to 50 mm 3 (medium stage) with PLD 6 (or 4) mg/kg. Experiments included the control, PLD alone, PLD + MBs + US, US alone, and MBs + US groups. The procedure for the PLD + MBs + US group was that PLD was injected first, MB (SonoVue) injection followed, and then US was immediately sonicated on the tumor. The results showed that: (1) US sonication with MBs was always able to produce a further hindrance to tumor growth for both early and medium-stage tumors; (2) for the medium-stage tumors, 6 mg/kg PLD alone was able to inhibit their growth, while it did not work for 4 mg/kg PLD alone; (3) with the application of MBs + US, 4 mg/kg PLD was able to inhibit the growth of medium-stage tumors; (4) for early stage tumors after the first treatment with a high dose of PLD alone (10 mg/kg), the tumor size still increased for several days and then decreased (a biphasic pattern); (5) MBs + US alone was able to hinder the growth of early stage tumors, but unable to hinder that of medium stage tumors. The results of histological examinations and blood perfusion measurements indicated that the application of MBs + US disrupts the tumor blood vessels and enhances the delivery of PLD into tumors to significantly inhibit tumor growth.
