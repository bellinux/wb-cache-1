60|$|In Dwight's Travels in New England it is {{stated that}} the {{inhabitants}} of Truro were formerly regularly warned {{under the authority of}} law in the month of April yearly, to plant beachgrass, as elsewhere they are warned to repair the highways. They dug up the grass in bunches, which were afterward divided into several smaller ones, and set about three feet apart, in rows, so arranged as to <b>break</b> <b>joints</b> and obstruct the passage of the wind. It spread itself rapidly, the weight of the seeds when ripe bending the heads of the grass, and so dropping directly by its side and vegetating there. In this way, for instance, they built up again that part of the Cape between Truro and Provincetown where the sea broke over in the last century. They have now a public road near there, made by laying sods, which were full of roots, bottom upward and close together on the sand, double {{in the middle of the}} track, then spreading brush evenly over the sand on each side for half a dozen feet, planting beachgrass on the banks in regular rows, as above described, and sticking a fence of brush against the hollows.|$|R

30|$|In {{the power}} {{allocation}} step, the PSO is exploited for obtaining the optimum power values on the selected RBs {{in the previous}} step. The reason for incorporating the PSO {{is that it is}} less complex and gives better results in less time. Owing to the various considered power levels, the PSO-based power allocation evaluates the best power values and minimizes the complexity of the game. On the other hand, the main concern of <b>breaking</b> the <b>joint</b> allocation task into two subproblems is to minimize the complexity of the proposed game.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{tests of}} the Convergence Hypothesis, or the {{tendency}} for per capita income levels to narrow over time, have included a time-series testing approach (see Bernard & Durlauf, 1995, 1996; Oxley & Greasley, 1995, Greasley & Oxley, 1997, 1998 a). Results have been mixed, with Bernard & Durlauf finding no evidence of convergence whereas Oxley & Greasley find evidence of two small convergence clubs. This paper adds to the debate by considering a newly created annual per capita income series for New Zealand, 1870 - 1993. The {{results show that the}} series is integrated of order 1, I(1), and neither a single <b>break</b> nor <b>joint</b> <b>breaks</b> overturn the null of a unit root. Combined with results from Greasley & Oxley (1998 a, 1998 b), this property of New Zealand data is incompatible with her belonging to a UK/Australia convergence club, or converging towards either of the North American economies. New Zealand per capita income growth is idiosyncratic, diverging below the growth rates of traditional trading partners. A conjunction of small size and insular economic policies distinguishes New Zealand's economic development. ...|$|R
40|$|For this paper, {{we carried}} out {{molecular}} dynamics simulation to calculate the bonding energy of the metal-SWNT interface. Three kinds of metal, namely iron, nickel and gold, were studied. The {{results show that the}} iron-SWNT interface has the strongest bonding energy, and then nickel and gold. To confirm these results, tensile loading tests were also performed to study the breaking force of the metal-SWNT interface. The force needed to debond the metal-SWNT interface is at the order of nano-newton. The more adhesion energy the interface has, the bigger force that must be loaded to <b>break</b> the <b>joint...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{shoulder}} strike (also {{referred to}} as a shoulder butt) is a strike with the anterior part of the shoulder. The shoulder strike can be used against the head of the opponent in close positions such as in a clinch or ground fighting, but is generally not considered to have knockout power. However, as used as a fulcrum for a joint hyperextention, such as an arm lock in classic jujitsu from stand-up or ground positions, can serve well to <b>break</b> said <b>joint</b> either when being the surface that an elbow is slammed upon or as a surface to balance out the break much as the thigh is for the juji-gatame in Judo.|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} topological nodal points can emerge in {{photonic}} crystal possessing mirror symmetry. The mechanism of generating topological nodal points {{is discussed in}} a two-dimensional photonic square lattice, in which four topological nodal points split out naturally after the touching of two bands with different parity. The emergence of such nodal points, characterized by vortex structure in momentum space, is attributed to the unavoidable band crossing protected by mirror symmetry. The topological nodes can be unbuckled through breaking the mirror symmetry and a photonic Chern insulator can be achieved through time reversal symmetry <b>breaking.</b> The <b>joint</b> effect of <b>breaking</b> time reversal symmetry and breaking inversion symmetry is further found to strengthen the finite size effect, providing ways to engineer helical edge states...|$|R
