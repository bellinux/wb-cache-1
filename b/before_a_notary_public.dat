25|$|The Kafala system {{involves}} a sponsor {{who has the}} legal responsibility for a migrant domestic worker during a contract period, making the worker dependent upon the sponsor. The Kafala system is not legally binding in Lebanon because recruiters cannot act as a sponsor. Instead the system {{is made up of}} a number for administrative regulations, customary practices and legal requirements which bind the worker to the recruiter temporarily.. Once in Lebanon, the migrant domestic worker is assigned an employer. A worker may not change employer or break the terms of the contract unless the employer signs a release waiver. This must be done <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>notary</b> <b>public</b> and Lebanese authorities give an official release. A worker becomes illegal if they leave without the consent of their sponsor and the official release from the authorities. Human Rights Watch has said that the Kafala system in Lebanon puts workers at risk of exploitation and abuse, while Anti-Slavery International has said that the system {{is one of the major}} causes of vulnerability of migrant workers. The Kafala system means that the sponsor of the migrant domestic worker is legally responsible for the migrant and the state's responsibility for 'alien surveillance' is then passed on to the employer.|$|E

2500|$|On 8 December 1379 a {{commission}} of oyer and terminer was issued following further allegations made by Kyngeston against Stevens {{and some of}} his associates. Kyngeston said that he had been assaulted at the priory itself by a gang consisting of Stevens, Richard de Westbury and Ralph de Wyburbury, both monks of Shrewsbury Abbey, Henry Morwood, the vicar of Handsworth, four other secular clergy and others. Abduced from the priory, he was held at a house in Sleap, one the Abbey's manors to the north of Shrewsbury. <b>Before</b> <b>a</b> <b>notary</b> <b>public</b> he was forced to sign a resignation statement and to call off all proceedings against Stevens. Despite the allegations of coercion, Bishop Robert de Stretton proceeded as if the prior's resignation were valid. He received letters under the seal of Sandwell Priory stating that the two remaining monks had elected Richard de Westbury as their prior and he confirmed Westbury as prior. Westbury now found himself challenged by Tudenham, the original pretender to the office. Tudenham obtained [...] papal provision to the priory and began an action against Westbury in the Church courts. However, Richard II's Council ordered his arrest on 8 July 1380 because he had breached the Statute of Provisors, a 1350 law designed to prevent such appointments by the Pope. Westbury seems not to have enjoyed good relations with the patrons. When Richard, the last of Guy de Offeni's male line died around 1250, the manor of West Bromwich had been divided between his daughters, Sarah and Margaret. The latter married into the Marnham family, which thereafter held half of the manor. In 1387 John Marnham sued Westbury for delivery of a bond which he had retained unlawfully, a nadir in the priory's relations with its lay patrons.|$|E

6000|$|It is a known rule of evidence, that an {{interest}} in the matter to be supported by testimony disqualifies a witness; yet Lord Mansfield held, [...] "that nice objections to a remote interest which could not be paid or released, though they held in other cases, were not allowed to disqualify a witness to a will, as parishioners might have [prove?] a devise {{to the use of the}} poor of the parish forever." [...] He went still nearer, and his doctrine tends so fully to settle the principles of departure from or adherence to rules of evidence, that your Committee inserts part of the argument at large. [...] "The disability of a witness from interest is very different from a positive incapacity. If a deed must be acknowledged <b>before</b> <b>a</b> judge or <b>notary</b> <b>public,</b> every other person is under a positive incapacity to authenticate it; but objections of interest are deductions from natural reason, and proceed upon a presumption of too great a bias in the mind of the witness, and the public utility of rejecting partial testimony. Presumptions stand no longer than till the contrary is proved. The presumption of bias may be taken off by showing the witness has a [as?] great or a greater interest the other way, or that he has given it up. The presumption of public utility may be answered by showing that it would be very inconvenient, under the particular circumstances, not to receive such testimony. Therefore, from the course of business, necessity, and other reasons of expedience, numberless exceptions are allowed to the general rule."[61] ...|$|R

Children who had {{received}} {{a portion of their}} parents’ property during their lifetimes surrendered further rights of inheritance, or, it was commonly thought that their inheritances had been settled. In interwar Dalmatia, these types of arrangements were formalized between parents and children <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>notary.</b> For the most part, daughters surrendered their right of inheritance, and sons only rarely. Daughters were deemed to have been compensated by the value of their dowries, while the amount of money invested into a son’s education was considered adequate compensation for him. Dowries consisted of money or movable property, thus in this way daughters were excluded from landed wealth. The custom of surrendering rights of inheritance was largely practiced among that portion of the population whose livelihood was tied to the land, among agricultural workers and landowners; while it was rarer among people of other occupations, though it was still found there too. Families that owned businesses did not attempt to avoid giving property to their daughters, but they did use the surrender of rights of inheritance to avoid giving them part of their businesses. The amount of compensation paid for surrendering rights of inheritance depended first and foremost on the occupation and wealth of the parents. The value of compensations were most likely tied to the general economic conditions because the lowest levels of compensation paid were immediately after the First World War and in the period 1934 - 1937, when the effects of the Great Depression were most keenly felt. The value of compensations in most cases probably amounted to an important piece of property, and these types of agreements, like wills, attempted to avoid the law of inheritance that set out equal division of property among descendents {{in the event of an}} intestate death...|$|R
