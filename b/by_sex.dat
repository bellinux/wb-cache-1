5|$|American kestrels in Canada and the {{northern}} United States typically migrate south in the winter, sometimes going as far as Central America and the Caribbean. Birds that breed south of about 35Â° north latitude are usually year-round residents. Migration also depends on local weather conditions. Wintering kestrels' choice of habitat varies <b>by</b> <b>sex.</b> Females are found in open areas more often than males during the non-breeding season. A common explanation for this behavior is that the larger females arrive at the preferred habitat first and exclude males from their territory.|$|E

5|$|Black Eye is {{the only}} {{full-length}} studio album by the English punk rock band Fluffy, released on September 17, 1996 by The Enclave. It was recorded at Metropolis Studios in London and produced by punk rock veteran Bill Price, who had recorded albums <b>by</b> <b>Sex</b> Pistols and The Clash. The album was recorded live {{in the studio and}} the music was not arranged by the producer in order to achieve a rough, live sound. The record contains loud punk songs that explore social issues such as sex and abuse.|$|E
5|$|Segregation <b>by</b> <b>sex</b> {{and size}} {{does not seem}} to occur. Whitetips follow schools of tuna or squid, and trail groups of {{cetaceans}} such as dolphins and pilot whales, scavenging their prey. Their instinct is to follow baitfish migrations that accompany ocean-going ships. When whaling took place in warm waters, oceanic whitetips were often responsible for much of the damage to floating carcasses.|$|E
5|$|Adult males live mostly {{alone or}} in groups of two to three, and join pods for short periods of time. Adult females and young {{dolphins}} normally live in groups of up to 15 animals. However, they live in fission-fusion societies of varying group size, within which individuals change associations, often on a daily or hourly basis. Group compositions are usually determined <b>by</b> <b>sex,</b> age, reproductive condition, familial relations and affiliation histories. In a dolphin community near Sarasota, Florida, the most common group types are adults females with their recent offspring, older subadults of both sexes and adult males either {{alone or in}} bonded pairs. Smaller groups can join to form larger groups of 100 or more, and occasionally exceed 1,000.|$|E
50|$|Tree snails {{are this}} raptor's {{favorite}} prey but frogs, salamanders, small mammals and insects are also taken.

Incubation is <b>by</b> both <b>sexes.</b> Semialtricial young stay in the nest 35-45 days and are fed <b>by</b> both <b>sexes.</b> This raptor is often considered sluggish and retiring, preferring to perch inside leafy canopy when not flying.|$|R

5|$|Found on or {{near the}} bottom, the blackmouth {{catshark}} favors a muddy habitat. There is little evidence for segregation <b>by</b> <b>sex.</b> A number of studies in the northern and western Mediterranean have reported that adults occur deeper than juveniles. Other studies though have found no such pattern. It is possible that areas such as the waters off southern France offer a habitat suitable for sharks of all ages. Another explanation with some scientific support is that adults are most common at intermediate depths, while young sharks are restricted to shallower water and both adults and juveniles are found in deeper water. If true, the age-depth inconsistencies observed from previous research could have resulted from incomplete depth sampling.|$|E
5|$|In a hierarchy, {{individuals}} are either dominant or submissive. A despotic hierarchy is where one individual is dominant {{while the others}} are submissive, as in wolves and lemurs, and a pecking order is a linear ranking of individuals {{where there is a}} top individual and a bottom individual. Pecking orders may also be ranked <b>by</b> <b>sex,</b> where the lowest individual of a sex has a higher ranking than the top individual of the other sex, as in hyenas. Dominant individuals, or alphas, have a high chance of reproductive success, especially in harems where one or a few males (resident males) have exclusive breeding rights to females in a group. Non-resident males can also be accepted in harems, but some species, such as the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), may be more strict.|$|E
5|$|Pelagic {{stingrays}} may segregate <b>by</b> <b>sex,</b> vertically in {{that males}} {{are found in}} deeper water than females, and perhaps horizontally as well. Captive individuals often act highly aggressively towards ocean sunfish (Mola mola), biting and harassing them, particularly if they are hungry. This species is preyed upon by oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus), great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), toothed whales, and other large, ocean-going carnivores. Its all-around dark coloration likely serves to camouflage it against its featureless habitat. The venom on its tail spine is also quite potent, causing it to be avoided by other fishes. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium benedeni, A. crassicolle, and A. filicolle, Rhinebothrium baeri and R. palombii, and Tetragonocephalum uarnak, and the monogenean Entobdella diadema.|$|E

5|$|The blacktip shark is an {{extremely}} fast, energetic predator that is usually found in groups of varying size. Segregation <b>by</b> <b>sex</b> and age does not occur; adult males and nonpregnant females are found apart from pregnant females, and both are separated from juveniles. In Terra Ceia Bay, Florida, a nursery area for this species, juvenile blacktips form aggregations {{during the day and}} disperse at night. They aggregate most strongly in the early summer when the sharks are youngest, suggesting that they are seeking refuge from predators (mostly larger sharks) in numbers. Predator avoidance may also be the reason why juvenile blacktips do not congregate in the areas of highest prey density in the bay. Adults have no known predators. Known parasites of the blacktip shark include the copepods Pandarus sinuatus and P. smithii, and the monogeneans Dermophthirius penneri and Dionchus spp., which attach the shark's skin. This species is also parasitized by nematodes in the family Philometridae, which infest the ovaries.|$|E
5|$|The fossa is a {{carnivore}} that hunts {{small to}} medium-sized animals. One of eight carnivorous species endemic to Madagascar, the fossa is the island's largest surviving endemic terrestrial mammal {{and the only}} predator capable of preying upon adults of all extant lemur species, the largest of which can weigh as much as 90percent {{of the weight of}} the average fossa. Although it is the predominant predator of lemurs, reports of its dietary habits demonstrate a wide variety of prey selectivity and specialization depending on habitat and season; diet does not vary <b>by</b> <b>sex.</b> While the fossa is thought to be a lemur specialist in Ranomafana National Park, its diet is more variable in other rain forest habitats.|$|E
5|$|The smalltail shark forms large aggregations {{segregated}} <b>by</b> <b>sex,</b> {{with the}} males generally found {{deeper than the}} females. It feeds mainly on bony fishes, including sea catfish, croakers, jacks, and grunts. Shrimp, crabs, and squid are secondary food sources, while adults are also capable of taking young sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon), hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna), and stingrays (Dasyatis). Opportunistic in habits, the dietary composition of this shark generally reflects what is most available in its environment; off northern Brazil, the most important prey species are the croakers Macrodon ancylodon and Stellifer naso. Juveniles consume {{a wider variety of}} prey than adults. In turn, the smalltail shark may potentially be preyed upon by larger sharks.|$|E

5|$|Sex {{therapist}} Ruth Westheimer {{said the}} device was most favored by those selecting from vibrators of the corded electrical variety. Therapist and sex educator Laura Berman recommended the device in many articles for the Chicago Sun-Times, both for women who had never experienced an orgasm {{and those who had}} difficulty becoming aroused. Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested <b>by</b> <b>sex</b> therapists.|$|E
