Annually, over 90 % of UK crops receive at least one foliar application of fungicide, but {{little is known about the}} sensitivity of the more damaging L. maculans and the less damaging L. biglobosa to these fungicides. The effects of flusilazole, tebuconazole and Methyl Benzimidazole Carbamate (MBC) fungicides (<b>benomyl</b> and <b>carbendazim)</b> on the germination of ascospores, conidia and germ tube growth of both species were examined. Isolates collected from different oilseed rape crops in England and Wales were assessed for their mycelial growth on fungicide-amended medium, and ED 50 values were calculated. RESULTS: Leptosphaeria maculans and L. biglobosa differed in their sensitivity to fungicides. Conidial germination of L. maculans was more sensitive to these fungicides than that of L. biglobosa. Isolates of L. maculans had smaller ED 50 values for mycelial growth for all fungicides tested than isolates of L. biglobosa.

The seeds had not developed infected and exhibited 100 % germination rate after sowing. The treatments as control group that were not pretreated with fungicide before storage at 23 ˚C for 8 weeks all developed infected.

In mice the benzimidazoles inhibited 3 H-thymidine incorporation in tissues with high cell renewal, with benomyl being more active than carbendazim.  They were rapidly absorbed with highest amounts seen in the liver, kidneys and gastro-intestinal lumen as evidenced from distribution of 14 C-labeled drugs. In human tumour cell lines, the benzimidazoles showed a similar activity pattern but benomyl was more potent. This was true also in tumour cells from patients but carbendazim was relatively more active against solid tumours. Analyses of drug activity cross-resistance patterns and of drug activity – gene expression correlations in a cell line panel suggested multiple mechanisms of action for the benzimidazoles. Cryptolepine was widely distributed to tissues in vivo in the mice. It was more potent than the benzimidazoles in tumour cells, with highest activity in haematological malignancies but some patient samples of breast, colon and non small-cell lung cancer were sensitive. Cross-resistance analysis indicated cryptolepine to be a topoisomerase II inhibitor whereas drug activity – gene expression correlations suggested additional mechanisms of action. HTS on 2   000 molecules in colon cancer cell lines and normal cells identified acriflavine as a hit molecule, subsequently shown to have unprecedented activity against colorectal cancer tumour cells in patient tumour samples. Connectivity map analysis, based on drug induced gene expression perturbation patterns in a tumour cell line, indicated acriflavine to be a topoisomerase inhibitor, subsequently confirmed in a plasmid relaxation assay.

40|$|The microtubule, {{which is}} one of the major targets of anthelmintics, anticancer drugs, and fungicides, is {{composed}} mainly of α- and β-tubulins. We focused on a unique characteristic of an Aspergillus nidulans benA 33 mutant to screen for microtubule-disrupting antifungal agents. This mutant, which has a β-tubulin with a mutation of a single amino acid, undergoes mitotic arrest due to the formation of hyperstable microtubules at 37 °C. The heat sensitivity of the mutant is remedied by some antimicrotubule agents. We found that an agar plate assay with the mutant was able to distinguish three types of microtubule inhibitors. The growth recovery zones of the mutant were formed around paper disks containing microtubule inhibitors, including four benzimidazoles, ansamitocin P- 3, griseofulvin, and rhizoxin, on the agar plate at 37 °C. Nocodazole, thiabendazole, and griseofulvin reversed the mitotic arrest of the mutant and promoted its hyphal growth. Ansamitocin P- 3 and rhizoxin showed growth recovery zones around the growth-inhibitory zones. <b>Benomyl</b> and <b>carbendazim</b> also reversed mitotic arrest but produced weaker growth recovery than the aforementioned drugs. Other microtubule inhibitors, such as colchicine, Colcemid, paclitaxel, podophyllotoxin, TN- 16, vinblastine, and vincristine, as well as some cytoskeletal inhibitors tested, did not show such activity. In our screening, we newly identified two mycotoxins, citrinin and patulin, two sesquiterpene dialdehydes, polygodial and warburganal, and four phenylalanine derivatives, arphamenine A, l- 2, 5 -dihydrophenylalanine (DHPA), N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethylketone, and N-carbobenzoxy-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone. In a wild-type strain of A. nidulans, DHPA caused selective losses of microtubules, as determined by fluorescence microscopy, and of both α- and β-tubulins, as determined by Western blot analysis. This screening method involving the benA 33 mutant of A. nidulans is useful, convenient, and highly selective. The phenylalanine derivatives tested are of a novel type of microtubule-disrupting antifungal agents, producing an accompanying loss of tubulins, and are different from well-known tubulin inhibitors affecting the assembly of tubulin dimers into microtubules...|$|R

Anthracnose is one of factor to reduce economic worth and time of post-harvest of fruits. A total of 105 Colletotrichum isolates obtained from infected fruits and leaves of strawberry and mango in main production area. Based on morphological and molecular characteristics, three C. acutatum and 102 C. gloeosporioides isolates were identified. For compaŠnng sensitivities to strobilurins (QoIs), all C. gloeosporioides isolates were examined sensitivities to four QoIs, kresoxim- methyl, azoxystrobin, trifloxystrobin and pyraclostrobin at 1, 10, 100 and 500 ppm (a. i.) by mycelial growth. Pyraclostrobin was highly efficacy to inhibit mycelial growth of all C. gloeosporioides isolates at 10 ppm (a. i.). Contrary to pyraclostrobin, kresoxim- methyl, azoxystrobin and trifloxystrobin only showed 45. 0 %, 44. 6 % and 46. 1 % mycelial growth inhibition rate at 500 ppm (a. i.), respectively. Previous studies indicated that the mutation at codon 143 in cytochrome b gene (cyt b) is the principal action of QoIs-resistant fungal pathogen. However, the QoIs-resistant isolates of C. gloeosporioides obtained from mango and strawberry did not be found the mutation at codon 143 of cyt b. The result indicated that the mutation at codon 143 of cyt b is not available character to increase the resistance of C. gloeosporioides isolates from mango and strawberry to QoIs in Taiwan. Moreover, the azoxystrobin did not raise the inhibiting efficacy of C. gloeosporioides isolates at salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) added PDA medium. Thus, alternative pathway respiration did not {{play an important role}} for C. gloeosporioides isolates enhanced resistance to QoIs. Interestingly, the nucleotide deletion of cyt b between codon 144 and 145 was detected among C. gloeosporioides isolates from mango, strawberry, orange, yam and sweet potato. The result suggests that the nucleotide deletion may change the protein structure of cyt b and enhance the resistance of C. gloeosporioides isolates to QoIs in Taiwan. In this study, thirty C. gloeosporioides isolates obtained from mango and strawberry were tested the sensitivities to benzimidazole fungicides, <b>benomyl,</b> thiabendazole and <b>carbendazim.</b> Results showed that mycelial growth of 18 C. gloeosporioides isolates were significantly inhibited at 1 ppm (a. i.) and 12 C. gloeosporioides isolates were resistant to those three benzimidazoles. Thus, the benzimidazoles-sensitive and -resistant C. gloeosporioides isolates were simultaneously existed in the field at Taiwan. Moreover, the positive cross-resistance among benzimidazoles on C. gloeosporioides isolates was existence, and the negative cross-resistance between benzimidazoles and QoIs were detected on some C. gloeosporioides isolates. For the benzimidazoles-resistant mechanism analysis, the resistant C. gloeosporioides isolates showed point mutation at codon 198 in β-tubulin gene and the amino acid was substituted glycine (Gly) to alanine (Ala). While, the codon 200, caused the moderately resistant to benzimidazoles, did not be detected among all C. gloeosporioides isolates. The results suggest that the mutation at codon 198 in β-tubulin gene is major mechanism of benzimidazoles-resistant C. gloeosporioides isolates in Taiwan. Consequently, the specific primers of TubGF 1 and TubGR were designed to amplify partial β-tubulin gene, including codon 198, and used PCR-RFLP method to detect the benzimidazoles -resistant C. gloeosporioides isolates in field. According to the result, this method could be rapidly and precisely to diagnose benzimidazoles-resistant C. gloeosporioides isolates obtained from mango and strawberry in Taiwan. 中文摘要 英文摘要 前言……………………………………………… 1 材料方法……………………………………………………………………………… 7 一、炭疽病菌株的蒐集與鑑定……………………………………………… 7 (一) 供試菌株來源………………………………………………………… 7 (二) 病原菌鑑定…………………………………………………………… 7 1. 形態學鑑定……………………………………………………… 7 2. 利用 ITS rDNA 鑑定炭疽病菌……………………………… 7 (1) 總 DNA之萃取與純化…………………………………… 7 (2) 利用 ITS 4 與專一性引子 (specific primer) 鑑定炭疽菌種 類………………………………………………………… 8 二、殺菌劑對炭疽病菌菌絲生長抑制測試………………………………… 8 (一) 對Strobilurin (QoI) 類殺菌劑的抗感性測試……………………… 8 (二) 對Benzimidazole 類殺菌劑的抗感性測試…………………… 9 三、抗藥性產生機制的探討 ……………………………………………… 10 (一) Cytochrome b基因突變與 QoIs 低感受性菌株的關係……… 10 1.
