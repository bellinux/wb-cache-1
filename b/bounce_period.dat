The form of the bounce-averaged diffusion equation is found regardless of details of the mirror geometry, suggesting that the numerical schemes developed for solving the modified two-dimensional (2 -D) Fokker-Planck equation in a magnetic dipole should be feasible for similar computation efforts on modeling wave-induced particle diffusion processes in any non-dipolar magnetic field. However, <b>bounce</b> <b>period</b> related terms and bounce-averaged diffusion coefficients are required to be computed in realistic magnetic fields. With the application to the Dungey magnetosphere that {{is controlled by the}} intensity of southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), we show that with enhanced southward IMF the normalized <b>bounce</b> <b>period</b> related term decreases accordingly, and bounce-averaged diffusion coefficients cover a broader range of electron energy and equatorial pitch angle with a tendency of increased magnitude and peaking at lower energies. The compression of the Dungey magnetosphere can generally produce scattering loss of plasma sheet electrons ~ 100 keV on a timescale shorter than that in a dipolar field, and induce momentum diffusion at high pitch angles closer to 90 °. Correspondingly, the strong diffusion rate drops considerably as a product of changes in both the equatorial loss cone and the <b>bounce</b> <b>period.</b> The extent of differences in all the parameters introduced by the southward IMF intensification also becomes larger for a field line with higher equatorial crossing.

So after compression, preexisting particles should be lost after ~ 10 s or min (Tsurutani et al. 2001). Here, the optical aurora data with very high time resolution at 10 s per image is quite essential for determining the response time of shock aurora. By examining the diffuse auroral sequential images presented here, the response time of the green diffuse aurora at MLT noon to the sudden shock compression as deduced from our optical observation is smaller than 10 s, which is greatly significant for understanding the solar wind-magnetosphere dynamical coupling process under extreme space environment.|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristic}} {{times for}} the absorption of energetic particles trapped in the Jupiter and Saturn magnetospheres by the respective planetary satellites are compared {{on the basis of}} Pioneer 10 and 11 data. Characteristic radiation lifetimes with respect to satellite absorption were calculated {{on the basis of a}} model of the radial diffusion of particles by the violation of the third adiabatic invariant in the presence of perfectly absorbing satellites, taking into account the tilt and offset of the planetary magnetic dipole moment vectors with respect to the spin axis and the finite gyroradii and <b>bounce</b> <b>periods</b> of the trapped particles. For energetic particles of dipole moments from 1 to 10, 000 MeV/G, it is found that the Saturnian times average at least an order of magnitude less than the Jovian times, and the Jovian times increase with increasing trapped particle magnetic mirror latitude. If it is assumed that the rates of radial diffusion are comparable in the two magnetospheres, the results indicate that the Saturnian satellites are more efficient absorbers of inwardly diffusing ions than are the Jovian satellites, due to the near rotational symmetry of the Saturnian magnetic field...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{works have}} shown the {{important}} role Nonlinear Electrodynamics (NLED) can have in two crucial questions of Cosmology, concerning particular moments of its evolution for very large and for low-curvature regimes, that is for very condensed phase and at the present period of acceleration. We present here a toy model of a complete cosmological scenario in which the main factor responsible for the geometry is a nonlinear magnetic field which produces a FRW homogeneous and isotropic geometry. In this scenario we distinguish four distinct phases: a <b>bouncing</b> <b>period,</b> a radiation era, an acceleration era and a re-bouncing. It has already been shown that in NLED a strong magnetic field can overcome the inevitability of a singular region typical of linear Maxwell theory; on the other extreme situation, that is for very weak magnetic field it can accelerate the expansion. The present model goes one step further: after the acceleration phase the universe re-bounces and enter in a collapse era. This behavior is {{a manifestation of the}} invariance under the dual map of the scale factor a(t) → 1 / a(t), a consequence of the corresponding inverse symmetry of the electromagnetic field (F → 1 / F, where F ≡ F^μνF_μν) of the NLED theory presented here.

40|$|We {{elaborate}} on the Ashtekar's formalism for spherically symmetric midisuperspaces and, for loop quantization, propound a new quantization scheme which yields a graph-preserving Hamiltonian constraint operator and by which one can impose the fundamental discreteness of loop quantum gravity a la the strategy of "improved" dynamics in loop quantum cosmology (LQC). Remarkable consequences are inferred at the heuristic level of effective dynamics: first, consistency of the constraint algebra regarding the Hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints fixes the improved quantization scheme {{to be of the}} form reminiscent of the improved scheme in LQC which preserves scaling invariance; second, consistency regarding two Hamiltonian constraints further demands the inclusion of higher order holonomy corrections and fixes a ratio factor of 2 for the improved scheme. It is suggested that the classical singularity is resolved and replaced by a quantum bounce which bridges a classical solution to another classical phase. However, the constraints violate briefly during the <b>bouncing</b> <b>period,</b> indicating that one cannot make sense of symmetry reduction by separating the degrees of freedom of the full theory into spherical and non-spherical ones {{in the vicinity of the}} quantum bounce, although the heuristic effective dynamics can still give a reliable semiclassical description of large-scale physics.

40|$|Non-adiabatic {{motion of}} plasma sheet protons causes pitch-angle {{scattering}} and isotropic precipitation to the ionosphere, which forms the proton auroral oval. This mechanism related to current sheet scattering (CSS) provides a specific energy–latitude dispersion pattern near the equatorward boundary of proton isotropic precipitation (isotropy boundary, IB), with precipitation sharply decreasing at higher (lower) latitude for protons with lower (higher) energy. However, this boundary maps {{to the inner}} magnetosphere, where wave-induced scattering may provide different dispersion patterns as recently demonstrated by Liang et al. (2014). Motivated by the potential usage of the IBs for the magnetotail monitoring {{as well as by}} the need to better understand the mechanisms forming the proton IB, we investigate statistically the details of particle flux patterns near the proton IB using NOAA-POES polar spacecraft observations made during September 2009. By comparing precipitated-to-trapped flux ratio (J 0 / J 90) at > 30 and > 80 keV proton energies, we found a relatively small number of simple CSS-type dispersion events (only 31 %). The clear reversed (wave-induced) dispersion patterns were very rare (5 %). The most frequent pattern had nearly coinciding IBs at two energies (63 %). The structured precipitation with multiple IBs was very frequent (60 %), that is, with two or more significant J 0 / J 90 dropouts. The average latitudinal width of multiple IB structures was about 1 °. Investigation of dozens of paired auroral zone crossings of POES satellites showed that the IB pattern is stable on a timescale of less than 2 min (a few proton <b>bounce</b> <b>periods)</b> but can evolve on a longer (several minutes) scale, suggesting temporal changes in some mesoscale structures in the equatorial magnetosphere.

40|$|In an open Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) space background, {{we study}} the {{classical}} and quantum cosmological {{models in the}} framework of the recently proposed nonlinear massive gravity theory. Although the constraints which are present in this theory prevent it from admitting the flat and closed FRW models as its cosmological solutions, for the open FRW universe, it is not the case. We have shown that, either in the absence of matter or {{in the presence of a}} perfect fluid, the classical field equations of such a theory adopt physical solutions for the open FRW model, in which the mass term shows itself as a cosmological constant. These classical solutions consist of two distinguishable branches: One is a contacting universe which tends to a future singularity with zero size, while another is an expanding universe having a past singularity from which it begins its evolution. A classically forbidden region separates these two branches from each other. We then employ the familiar canonical quantization procedure in the given cosmological setting to find the cosmological wave functions. We use the resulting wave function to investigate the possibility of the avoidance of classical singularities due to quantum effects. It is shown that the quantum expectation values of the scale factor, although they have either contracting or expanding phases like their classical counterparts, are not disconnected from each other. Indeed, the classically forbidden region may be replaced by a <b>bouncing</b> <b>period</b> in which the scale factor bounces from the contraction to its expansion eras. Using the Bohmian approach of quantum mechanics, we also compute the Bohmian trajectory and the quantum potential related to the system, which their analysis shows are the direct effects of the mass term on the dynamics of the universe.

Non-dipolar effects in the gradient-curvature drift rate are most important at the equator and affect particles with all mirror latitudes. The effect is a factor of 10 - 15 for Jupiter with its strong magnetodisc current and 1 - 2 for Saturn with its more moderate ring current.

40|$|The cusp {{energetic}} particle (CEP) {{event is}} a new magnetospheric phenomenon. The events were detected in the dayside cusp for hours, in which the measured helium ions had energies up to 8 MeV. All of these events were associated with a dramatic decrease and large fluctuations in the local magnetic field strength. During January 1999 - December 1999 covered by this report, I have studied the CEP events by analyzing the POLAR, GEOTAIL, and WIND particle and magnetic field data measured during the geomagnetic quiet periods in 1996 and one geomagnetic storm period in 1998. The simultaneous observations indicated that the ion fluxes in the CEP events were higher than that in both the upstream and the downstream from the bow shock. The pitch angle distribution of the helium ions in the CEP events was found to peak around 90 deg. It {{was found that the}} mirror parameter, defined as the ratio of the square root of the integration of the parallel turbulent power spectral component over the ultra-low frequency (ULF) ranges to the mean field in the cusp, is correlated with the intensity of the cusp MeV helium flux, which {{is a measure of the}} influence of mirroring interactions and an indication of local effect. It was also found that the turbulent power of the local magnetic field in the ultra-low frequency (ULF) ranges is correlated with the intensity of the cusp energetic helium ions. Such ULF ranges correspond to periods of about 0. 33 - 500 seconds that cover the gyroperiods, the <b>bounce</b> <b>periods,</b> and the drift periods of the tens keV to MeV charged particles when they are temporarily confined in the high-altitude dayside cusp. These observations represent a discovery that the high-altitude dayside cusp {{is a new}} acceleration and dynamic trapping region of the magnetosphere. The cusp geometry is connected via gradient and curvature drift of these energized ions to the equatorial plasma sheet as close as the geostationary orbit at local midnight. It implies that the dayside cusp is potentially an important source of magnetospheric particles. The discovery of the CEP events has been recognized as one of the most significant results from POLAR. I was invited to give a talk at 1999 IUGG meeting to interpret the CEP events.

50|$|The third type of {{potential}} donor in an AM CVn {{system is the}} evolved main-sequence star. In this case, the secondary star does not cause a common envelope, but fills its Roche lobe {{near the end of}} the main sequence (terminal-age main sequence or TAMS). An important ingredient for this scenario is magnetic braking, which allows efficient angular-momentum loss from the orbit and hence a strong shrinkage of the orbit to ultra-short periods. The scenario is rather sensitive to the initial orbital period; if the donor star fills its Roche lobe too long before the TAMS the orbit will converge, but <b>bounce</b> at <b>periods</b> of 70-80 minutes, like ordinary CVs. If the donor starts mass transfer too long after the TAMS, the mass-transfer rate will be high and the orbit will diverge. Only a narrow range of initial periods, around this bifurcation period will lead to the ultra-short periods that are observed in AM CVn stars. The process of bringing the two stars into a close orbit under the influence of magnetic braking is called magnetic capture. AM CVn stars formed this way may be observed either before or after the period minimum (which can lie anywhere between 5 and 70 minutes, depending on exactly when the donor star filled its Roche lobe) and are assumed to have some hydrogen on their surface.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an inflationary universe {{model in which}} the phase of accelerated expansion was preceded by a non-singular <b>bounce</b> and a <b>period</b> of contraction which involves a phase of deceleration. We follow fluctuations which exit the Hubble radius in the radiation-dominated contracting phase as quantum vacuum fluctuations, re-enter the Hubble radius in the deflationary period and re-cross during the phase of inflationary expansion. Evolving the fluctuations using the general relativistic linear perturbation equations, we find that they exit the Hubble radius during inflation not with a scale-invariant spectrum, but with a highly red spectrum with index $n_s = - 3 $. We also show that the back-reaction of fluctuations limits the time interval of deflation. Our toy model demonstrates the importance for inflationary cosmology both of the trans-Planckian problem for cosmological perturbations and of back-reaction effects. Firstly, without understanding both Planck-scale physics and the phase which preceded inflation, it is a non-trivial assumption to take the perturbations {{to be in their}} local vacuum state when they exit the Hubble radius at late times. Secondly, the back-reaction effects of fluctuations can influence the background in an important way. Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures, 2 references adde...|$|R

In addition to the angular momentum losses associated with gravitational radiation, magnetic braking, and mass loss from the system, we also include the effects of circumbinary disks on the evolution. For a fractional mass input rate into the disk, corresponding to 3 × 10 - 4 of the mass transfer rate, the model systems exhibit a <b>bounce</b> at orbital <b>periods</b> greater than 2. 75 hr. The simulations reveal that (1) some systems can exist as dwarf novae throughout their lifetime, (2) dwarf novae can evolve into novalike systems, and (3) novalike systems can evolve back into dwarf novae during their postbounce evolution to longer orbital periods. Among these subclasses, novalike cataclysmic variables {{would be the best}} candidates to search for circumbinary disks at wavelengths >~ 10 μm. The theoretical orbital period distribution is in reasonable accord with the combined population of dwarf novae and novalike systems above the period gap, suggesting the possibility that systems with unevolved donors need not detach and evolve below the period gap as in the disrupted magnetic braking model. The resulting population furthermore reveals the possible presence of systems with small mass ratios and a preference of O/Ne/Mg white dwarfs in dwarf nova systems in comparison to novalike systems. The novalike population furthermore shows a lack of systems with high-mass white dwarfs. The importance of observational bias in accounting for the differing populations is examined, and it is shown that an understanding of these effects is necessary in order to confront the theoretical distributions with the observed ones in a meaningful manner...|$|R

40|$|Plasma sheet ions do not {{conserve}} {{their first}} adiabatic invariant when {{the magnetic field}} is appreciably tail-like. They do conserve a different adiabatic invariant but only to linear, rather than exponential, accuracy in the appropriate small parameter. Thus significant stochastic diffusion can occur for particles crossing the separatrix dividing the segments of orbits on which the particles cross and do not cross the tail midplane. Such ions can escape the plasma sheet and precipitate into the atmosphere. Stochastic scattering is strongest from those field lines where the ion's Larmor period in the normal component of the neutral sheet magnetic field approximately equals its <b>bounce</b> <b>period.</b> By comparing the rates of stochastic ion loss and convection in the tail, {{it is possible to}} estimate the location and thickness of the inner edge of the ion plasma sheet created by stochastic ion loss. Ions of different masses precipitate into the atmosphere at slightly different locations. Since wave particle interactions are not needed, this precipitation will always occur and should be particularly evident during quiet geomagnetic conditions, when it is less likely to be masked by other precipitation mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{population}} of non magnetic cataclysmic variables evolving {{under the influence}} of a circumbinary disk is investigated for systems above the upper edge of the period gap at orbital periods greater than 2. 75 hr. For a fractional mass input rate into the disk, corresponding to 3 e- 4 of the mass transfer rate, the model systems exhibit a <b>bounce</b> at orbital <b>periods</b> greater than 2. 75 hr. The simulations reveal that (1) some systems can exist as dwarf nova type systems throughout their lifetime, (2) dwarf nova type systems can evolve into nova-like systems as their mass transfer rate increases with increasing circumbinary disk mass, and (3) nova-like systems can evolve back into dwarf nova systems during their postbounce evolution to longer orbital periods. Among these subclasses, nova-like cataclysmic variables would be the best candidates to search for circumbinary disks at wavelengths greater than 10 micron. The theoretical orbital period distribution of our population synthesis model is in reasonable accord with the combined {{population of}} dwarf novae and nova-like systems above the period gap, suggesting the possibility that systems with unevolved donors need not detach and evolve below the period gap as in the disrupted magnetic braking model. The resulting population furthermore reveals the possible presence of systems with small mass ratios (a property of systems exhibiting superhump phenomena at long orbital periods) and a preference of O/Ne/Mg white dwarfs in dwarf nova systems in comparison to nova-like systems. The importance of observational bias in accounting for the differing populations is examined, and it is shown that an understanding of these effects is necessary in order to confront the theoretical distributions with the observed ones in a meaningful manner.

40|$|We present time-resolved optical {{spectroscopy}} of {{the dwarf}} nova GW Librae during its rare 2007 April superoutburst and compare these with quiescent epochs. The data provide {{the first opportunity}} to track {{the evolution of the}} principal spectral features. In {{the early stages of the}} outburst, the optically thick disc dominates the optical and the line components show clear orbital radial velocity excursions. In the course of several weeks, optically thin regions become more prominent as strong emission lines replace the broad disc absorption. Post-outburst spectroscopy covering the I band illustrates the advantages of Ca II relative to the commonly used Balmer lines when attempting to constrain binary parameters. Due to the lower ionization energy combined with smaller thermal and shear broadening of these lines, a sharp emission component is seen to be moving in between the accretion disc peaks in the Ca II line. No such component is visible in the Balmer lines. We interpret this as an emission component originating on the hitherto unseen mass donor star. This emission component has a mean velocity of similar to - 15 +/- 5 km s(- 1) which is associated with the systemic velocity., and a velocity semi-amplitude of K-em = 82. 2 +/- 4. 9 km s(- 1). Doppler tomography reveals an asymmetric accretion disc, with the S-wave mapping to a sharp spot in the tomogram with a velocity consistent to what is obtained with line profile fitting. A centre of symmetry analysis of the disc component suggests a very small value for the WD orbital velocity K- 1 as is also inferred from double Gaussian fits to the spectral lines. While our conservative dynamical limits place a hard upper limit on the binary mass ratio of q < 0. 23, we favour a significantly lower value near q similar to 0. 06. Pulsation modelling suggests a white dwarf mass similar to 1 M-circle dot. This, paired with a low-mass donor, near the empirical sequence of an evolved cataclysmic variable close to the <b>period</b> <b>bounce,</b> appears to be consistent with all the observational constraints to date...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a theory for the longitudinally averaged satellite sweeping rate in an offset, tilted dipole magnetic field. It includes the {{reductions in the}} sweeping rate when the moon radius is not large compared to the gyroradius or the azimuthal drift distance during a <b>bounce</b> <b>period.</b> With a large tilt angle between the magnetic and rotation axes, moons make large excursions in dipole L value, {{and more than one}} moon can sweep at a given L. The sweeping rate peaks at the minimum L for each moon. If the gyroradius is large, additional peaks can occur when the particle mirrors near the moon latitude. To illustrate the theory, sweeping rates are evaluated for parameters relevant to the observations at Uranus by the Voyager 2 Low Energy Charged Particles Experiment. Calculated sweeping rates for ions and electrons are typically two or three orders of magnitude less than the strong-diffusion loss rate. The observation of sweeping signatures at Uranus would imply that pitch-angle scattering there occurs at a rate far below the strong-diffusion limit, contrasting with the situation for energetic ions in the inner Jovian magnetosphere...|$|E
