50|$|When the <b>bleed</b> <b>screw</b> is loosened, {{antifreeze}} {{is added}} to the vehicle's cooling system and the increase in fluid pressure displaces air through the opened <b>bleed</b> <b>screw.</b> When liquid begins to flow out, all air has been removed from the system and the <b>bleed</b> <b>screw</b> is closed.|$|E
50|$|The {{pump and}} hold method, the brake pedal is pressed while one <b>bleed</b> <b>screw</b> {{at a time}} is opened, {{allowing}} air to escape. The <b>bleed</b> <b>screw</b> must be closed before releasing the pedal.|$|E
50|$|The key looks {{similar to}} that used to wind a clock. It is {{inserted}} into the protrusion, mates with the <b>bleed</b> <b>screw</b> and turns it. Opening the <b>bleed</b> <b>screw</b> then allows air which has risen {{to the top of the}} radiator system (the top of the radiator itself) to escape and new water to take its place. Removing the air and allowing water to displace it makes the radiator work more efficiently since water conducts heat better than air.|$|E
50|$|Automatic valves {{are used}} to release trapped air as it collects. They are not a {{substitute}} for bleeding a system manually when it is first filled during commissioning, nor for remedial bleeding if the system becomes choked with trapped air. In those cases, individual <b>bleed</b> <b>screws</b> on each radiator, or high pipe run, are opened manually.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bleed</b> <b>screws</b> are {{not common}} on cars today and are only {{necessary}} when {{design of a}} vehicle's cooling system results in areas where air can be trapped in the system. Air in the system can lead to overheating of the engine and in modern cars also to poor vehicle operation (e.g. problems with the AC system or incorrect engine idle).|$|R
50|$|On a {{hydraulic}} vehicle braking systems, the <b>bleed</b> <b>screws</b> (sometimes known as bleed nipples or bleeder valves) are {{located at the}} top of each brake caliper to allow bleeding of the braking system. Whenever service work has been performed on the braking system which might have introduced air into the system (i.e. the hydraulic system has been opened), the air must be bled out. This is necessary for correct operation of the system, because air compresses (as opposed to brake fluid which is not compressible). Air in the system reduces the maximum pressure applied to the brake pistons and can lead to loss of braking ability.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bleed</b> <b>screw</b> is {{a device}} {{used to create}} a {{temporary}} opening in an otherwise closed hydraulic system, which facilitates the removal of air or another substance from the system by way of pressure and density differences.|$|E
50|$|On a home {{radiator}} unit, the <b>bleed</b> <b>screw</b> can be opened, {{usually by}} means of a key, to allow unwanted air to escape from the unit. Bleed screws are also found on some pump types fulfilling a similar purpose.|$|E
50|$|Cars with manual {{gearshift}} use a clutch. Clutches {{are controlled}} from pedal by bowden cable or hydraulic systems, some use the fluid {{in common with}} the brake system. As a dead end of the hydraulic system, the slave cylinder is equipped with a <b>bleed</b> <b>screw.</b>|$|E
50|$|Larger valves are {{available}} for larger systems and these may be more sophisticated. They usually have a manual <b>bleed</b> valve or <b>screw.</b> They are also dismantlable for cleaning or repair. The float linkage may have multiple lever arms, {{in order to give}} greater mechanical advantage on the valve.|$|R
50|$|The {{process is}} {{performed}} by forcing clean, bubble-free brake fluid {{through the entire}} system, usually from the master cylinder(s) to the calipers of disc brakes (or the wheel cylinders of drum brakes), but in certain cases in the opposite direction. A brake <b>bleed</b> <b>screw</b> is normally mounted at the highest point on each cylinder or caliper.|$|E
50|$|Engine cooling {{systems can}} also have bleed screws. They can {{take the form of}} a bolt with a hole through the middle that is {{threaded}} into a hole on the vehicle's cylinder head. This hole goes into the water jacket of the cylinder head. In other designs, the <b>bleed</b> <b>screw</b> is placed in the uppermost hose which leads to the heater core, i.e. at the highest point of the cooling system.|$|E
