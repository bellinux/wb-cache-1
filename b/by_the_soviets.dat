5|$|An interbellum Polish film {{directed}} by Leonard Buczkowski, Gwiaździsta eskadra (The Starry Squadron), {{was inspired by}} Cooper's experiences as a Polish Air Force officer. The film was made {{with the cooperation of}} the Polish army and was the most expensive Polish film prior to World War II. After World War II, all copies of the film found in Poland were destroyed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bloeme was liberated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> at Liebau on 8 May 1945. She and a {{small group}} of friends began walking back to the Netherlands on foot, {{arriving}} six weeks later. She discovered that her parents and sister had been deported to the Sobibor extermination camp, where they all perished.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> re-occupation of Latvia in 1944 {{refers to}} the re-occupation of Latvia <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union from 1944 to 1991. During World War II Latvia was first {{occupied}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in June 1940 and then was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1941-1944 after which it was re-occupied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.|$|R
25|$|In 1920, Armenia {{fought a}} series of battles with Turkey during the Turkish-Armenian War. After an {{invasion}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Red Army, Armenia was absorbed in 1921 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.|$|R
50|$|Although {{he did not}} {{consider}} {{himself to be a}} political dissident, Khvostenko was regularly harassed and persecuted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> authorities, accused of social parasitism (тунея́дство), and at one point was put into a psychiatric hospital (a tactic commonly employed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> authorities for punishing political dissidents). At the time Khvostenko was good friends with a prominent Russian poet Joseph Brodsky, who was also persecuted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> authorities.|$|R
5|$|During the Soviet era, {{the losses}} {{in the battle of}} Narva were not {{released}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> In recent years, Russian authors have published some figures but not for the whole course of the battles. The number of Soviet casualties can only be estimated indirectly.|$|E
5|$|During the war the {{chancellery}} was destroyed, {{except for}} the exterior walls, by air raids and in the Battle of Berlin in 1945. It was eventually dismantled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> and rumors have it, that the remains {{have been used for}} other building projects like the Humboldt University, Mohrenstraße metro station or Soviet war memorials in Berlin, but none of these are true.|$|E
5|$|Misch {{lived in}} Berlin {{in the same}} house he moved into when he was {{released}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> The house is in the district of Rudow in South Berlin. Misch regularly received visitors who wished to speak to or interview him. Misch died in Berlin on 5 September 2013 at the age of 96.|$|E
50|$|The WPC was {{dominated}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union during <b>the</b> Cold War. Many winners of its prizes have {{also won the}} Lenin Peace Prize, a separate prize awarded by a panel appointed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> government.|$|R
25|$|Pearson nearly {{became the}} first Secretary-General of the United Nations in 1945, but this move was vetoed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. He was a {{contender}} to become the second Secretary-General in 1953, but was also vetoed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.|$|R
50|$|After World War II {{the region}} was placed under Polish {{administration}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Potsdam Agreement under territorial changes demanded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. Most Germans fled or were expelled and replaced with Poles expelled from the Polish areas annexed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.|$|R
5|$|Vergniaud {{became a}} target ship {{and was used}} to {{evaluate}} the effects of poison gases and bombs until 1926. She was listed for disposal on 5 May 1927 and was sold for breaking up on 27 November 1928 for the price of 5,623,123 francs. A monument to the French mutineers of 1919 was erected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> in Sevastopol, at Morskaïa Square where Vergniauds sailor was killed.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{both the}} old and new Chancellery {{buildings}} were levelled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> Despite some attempts at demolition, the underground complex remained largely undisturbed until 1988–89. During reconstruction of that area of Berlin, the sections of the old bunker complex that were excavated were for the most part destroyed. The site remained unmarked until 2006, when a small plaque with a schematic diagram was installed. Some corridors of the bunker still exist, but are sealed off from the public.|$|E
5|$|Amin's {{short-lived}} {{presidency was}} marked by controversies from beginning to end. He came to power by ordering {{the death of his}} predecessor Nur Muhammad Taraki. The revolt against communist rule which had begun under Taraki worsened under Amin, and was a problem that his government was unable to solve. The Soviet Union, which alleged that Amin was an agent of the CIA, intervened in Afghanistan while invoking the Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. Amin was assassinated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> in December 1979 as part of Operation Storm-333, having ruled for slightly longer than three months.|$|E
50|$|After the war {{the city}} grew, {{absorbing}} many nearby villages (Gyöngyöshermán, Gyöngyösszőlős, Herény, Kámon, Olad, Szentkirály, Zanat and Zarkaháza). The government of Hungary was dominated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. During <b>the</b> revolution in 1956, {{the city was}} occupied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> army.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, Portugal {{resided in}} Czernowitz. As part of Northern Bukovina, Czernowitz was annexed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1940, then {{occupied}} by German and Romanian forces during World War II until <b>the</b> liberation <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> army in April 1944.|$|R
50|$|After World War II {{the region}} was placed under Polish {{administration}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Potsdam Agreement under territorial changes demanded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.

5|$|Bormann {{returned}} with Hitler to the Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945 as the Red Army approached the city. After Hitler committed suicide, Bormann and others attempted to flee Berlin on 2 May to avoid capture <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> Bormann probably committed suicide on a bridge near Lehrter station. The body was buried nearby on 8 May 1945, {{but was not}} found and confirmed as Bormann's until 1972. Bormann was tried in absentia by the International Military Tribunal in the Nuremberg trials of 1945 and 1946. He was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity {{and sentenced to death}} by hanging.|$|E
5|$|Evstafi was {{captured}} when the Germans took {{the city in}} May 1918 and {{was turned over to}} the Allies after the Armistice in November 1918. Her engines were destroyed in 1919 by the British when they withdrew from Sevastopol to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using them against the White Russians. She was abandoned when the Whites evacuated the Crimea in 1920 and was scrapped <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> in 1922–23.|$|E
5|$|From 1950 onward, McCarthy {{continued}} {{to exploit the}} fear of Communism and to press his accusations {{that the government was}} failing to deal with Communism within its ranks. McCarthy also began investigations into the numerous homosexuals working in the foreign policy bureaucracy, who were considered prime candidates for blackmail <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> These accusations received wide publicity, increased his approval rating, and gained him a powerful national following.|$|E
50|$|The {{city was}} {{occupied}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Red Army {{along with the}} rest of Estonia in 1940 during World War II. It was then occupied by Germany from 1941 until 1944 before it was reoccupied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union as part of <b>the</b> Estonian <b>Soviet</b> Socialist Republic from 1944-1991.|$|R
50|$|After World War II {{the region}} was placed under Polish {{administration}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Potsdam Agreement under territorial changes demanded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.

50|$|The graves from 1918-1944, the gravestones of the Estonian {{soldiers}} and the monuments of the Estonian War of Independence were largely destroyed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> authorities and <b>the</b> graveyard {{was taken over}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Red Army for use <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> occupation forces after World War II.|$|R
5|$|In the Official History of Australian Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and Post-Cold War Operations, author David Horner {{stated that}} the Australian {{government}} led by Robert Menzies was loath to criticise South Africa during the 1950s. At that time Australia generally opposed anti-colonial movements (which were often supported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> or China), believing them part of a worldwide communist offensive. Indeed, as late as 1961 Australia (and Britain) abstained from a vote to condemn South Africa in the UN.|$|E
5|$|Ioann Zlatoust was {{captured}} when the Germans took {{the city in}} May 1918 and {{was turned over to}} the Allies after the Armistice in November 1918. Her engines were destroyed in 1919 by the British when they withdrew from Sevastopol to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using the ship against the White guards. She was abandoned when the Whites evacuated the Crimea in 1920 and was scrapped <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> in 1922–23.|$|E
5|$|On 11 October 1944 {{the city}} was {{captured}} by Romanian and Soviet troops. It was formally restored to the Kingdom of Romania by the Treaty of Paris in 1947. On 24 January 6 March and 10 May 1946, the Romanian students, who {{had come back to}} Cluj after the restoration of northern Transylvania, rose against the claims of autonomy made by nostalgic Hungarians and the new way of life imposed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets,</b> resulting in clashes and street fights.|$|E
50|$|Not {{long after}} the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact in 1939, Latvia was {{occupied}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. Whereas <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> regime released <b>the</b> Communists imprisoned <b>by</b> Ulmanis with great ceremony, political prisoners from Pērkonkrusts were not freed. Instead, more members of Pērkonkrusts were arrested <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> authorities during 1940-1941, some of them being deported to Siberia.|$|R
50|$|After World War II {{the region}} was placed under Polish {{administration}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Potsdam Agreement under territorial changes demanded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.

5|$|Panteleimon was {{captured}} when the Germans took Sevastopol in May 1918 and was {{handed over to}} the Allies after the Armistice in November 1918. Its engines were destroyed by the British in 1919 when they withdrew from Sevastopol to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using them against the White Russians. It was abandoned when the Whites evacuated the Crimea in 1920 and was finally scrapped <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Soviet-oriented parties, {{backed by}} the Soviet Red Army and {{in control of the}} {{security}} forces, held most of the power, concentrated especially in the Polish Workers' Party under Władysław Gomułka and Bolesław Bierut. Bierut represented the influx of appointees to the Polish party coming (during and after the war) from the Soviet Union and imposed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets,</b> a process accelerated {{at the time of the}} PPR Congress of December 1945. The party's membership dramatically increased from perhaps a few thousand in early 1945 to over one million in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Stalin's early {{policies}} {{pushed for}} rapid industrialisation, nationalisation of private {{industry and the}} collectivisation of private plots created under Lenin's New Economic Policy. As leader of the Politburo, Stalin consolidated near-absolute power by 1938 after the Great Purge, a series of campaigns of political repression and persecution. Nazi German troops invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, but were repulsed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> in December. On Stalin's orders, the USSR launched a counter-attack on Nazi Germany. Stalin died in March 1953, his death triggered a power struggle in which Nikita Khrushchev after several years emerged victorious against Georgy Malenkov.|$|E
