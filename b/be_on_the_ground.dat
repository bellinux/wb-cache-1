5|$|The American {{government}} saw {{the evacuation}} {{as an opportunity}} to weaken the communists by providing for and thereby winning the loyalty of the refugees to the anti-communist cause. The United States Operation Mission proposed that aside from helping to evacuate refugees to the south and thereby draining the communist population base, the Americans should provide healthcare, shelter, food and clothing in order to help the anti-communists win the fidelity of their compatriots. Another benefit of participating in the evacuation was that American personnel would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in North Vietnam, allowing them to gather intelligence on communist activities.|$|E
5|$|A {{high risk}} day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} may <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> for a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is greater or the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E

Kamanin estimated German losses at 30 twin-engined airplanes and one Focke-Wulf Fw 190 (of the 150 aircraft presumed to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground)</b> plus warehouses and other materiel. The same night, similar strikes at three other airfields effectively crippled German {{resistance in the}} air.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} later, Operation Musketeer needed {{the element of}} total {{surprise}} to succeed, and all 660 men had to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> at El Gamil airfield and ready for action within {{four and a half}} minutes. At 04.15 hours on November 5, 1956, British 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment jumped in and although opposition was heavy, casualties were few. Meanwhile, French paratroopers of the 2nd Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment under the command of Colonel Chateau-Jobert jumped on the water treatment factory South of Port Said.|$|E
25|$|O. vernalis can {{be found}} in many {{different}} habitats, including marshes, meadows, the edges of streams, and open woods. It prefers to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> in open areas without a lot of shrubs. During hibernation, the smooth green snake looks for burrows, ant hills, and other dug-out underground areas, normally gathering in large numbers. It prefers moist habitats and areas near permanent water sources, usually staying in green areas for camouflage. Being cold blooded, it prefers warm areas, lying in the sun on rocks and logs, also using them for hiding.|$|E

25|$|Similarly to the {{previous}} Souls games, slaying enemies grants the player Blood Echoes, which doubles as the player's experience points and the game's currency. Should the player die, their Blood Echoes will be lost {{at the location of}} their death. If they are able to reach that point again, they can regain them. However, should the player die before they can retrieve their lost Blood Echoes, they will be lost forever. Sometimes, the player's Blood Echoes may be captured by an enemy, typically identified by glowing blue eyes; defeating this enemy will return the lost Blood Echoes. If an enemy does not hold the Blood Echoes, they will <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> near the location of the player's death. Insight is a secondary form of currency; they can be spent to purchase items and depending on the players Insight level, the world will change in many different ways. When the player reaches a specific Insight level, some NPCs or enemies might no longer be present, the sky and moon may change colour, the player may start hearing different sounds (such as a crying baby and mysterious whispering), or enemies' attack patterns may change. The world also changes as the player progresses through the main story. Insight can be gained by finding and defeating bosses or using items that grant Insight.|$|E

500|$|It is {{commonly}} and mistakenly {{thought that if}} the condensation funnel of a tornado does not reach the ground, then the tornado cannot cause substantial damage. This is another deadly myth. A tornado appears to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> only when its condensation funnel descends to the surface, but this is misleading. The circular, violent surface winds, not the condensation funnel, are what both define the tornado and cause the tornado's damage. Spotters should keep sight of swirling debris directly under any visible funnel or rotating wall cloud, even if such structures appear to not descend entirely to the ground. [...] Additionally, tornadoes can be wrapped in rain and thus may not be visible at all.|$|E

500|$|Gardens in {{the upper}} park area include Longfellow Gardens, Minnehaha Falls Pergola Garden, and the Song of Hiawatha Garden. The lower glen area offers {{examples}} of a surprisingly large number of trees that are native to Minnesota including basswood, black ash, maples, oaks, willows, and cottonwoods. [...] Unusual plants include the first spring-blooming plant, skunk cabbage, often blooming so early that temperatures are still freezing and snow may still <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> [...] As the name implies, they have a disagreeable odor except to the various insects that prefer to feed on rotting flesh or dung. By consuming carbohydrates stored in its fleshy roots, skunk cabbages can maintain a temperature inside the spathe that is 15–35 degrees warmer than the surrounding air temperature. The warmth helps attract cold-blooded, early-emerging pollinating insects during early spring when temperatures are still chilly. [...] As the spathe dies back the large, showy leaves emerge which die back by mid-August, making the plant difficult to find in late summer. Other wild flowers include wild ginger, trout lilies, anemones, marsh marigold and various ferns and sedges. [...] The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board is working to remove invasive species that have been introduced into the park {{in order to promote}} a healthy environment so that native species may survive and grow.|$|E

I support the international effort to protect the civilians of Libya." [...] However, Wyden also stressed that his support was not unlimited and that he expected that the military action would be completed quickly. Wyden, along with fellow Senator Merkley and President Obama, agreed that U.S. forces should not <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in Libya.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Byron White {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion. He addressed the important topic of neutrality of the regulation by stating [...] "The {{requirement that the}} regulation be content-neutral is clearly satisfied. The courts below accepted that view, {{and it is not}} disputed here that the prohibition on camping, and on sleeping specifically, is content-neutral and is not being applied because of disagreement with the message presented. Neither was the regulation faulted, nor could it <b>be,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> that without overnight sleeping the plight of the homeless could not be communicated in other ways. The regulation otherwise left the demonstration intact, with its symbolic city, signs, and the presence of those who were willing to take their turns in a day-and-night vigil. Respondents do not suggest that there was, or is, any barrier to delivering to the media, or to the public by other means, the intended message concerning the plight of the homeless." ...|$|E

Front row players can only strike for the ball with a single foot once it is in the tunnel. Players cannot intentionally collapse the scrum or force players upwards out of the scrum at any time during a scrum. Both sides must try to push straight against one another, and deliberately pushing on an angle or pulling on an opponent to rotate (or [...] "wheel") the scrum are penalised but if the contest between them results in the scrum rotating more than 90 degrees the scrum is reset with the ball going to the opposition. The opposition scrum half stands next to the feeding half and can follow the ball through the scrum as long as both feet remain behind the ball. The opposition scrum half can also move to the other side of the scrum or away from the scrum, but in this situation must stay behind the number eights feet.|$|E

2500|$|Pow wow {{etiquette}} is required; such as {{rules for}} when photography {{is or is}} not acceptable, protocol for the Grand Entry, and so on. A few guidelines are common; clothing worn by participants is known as [...] "regalia" [...] and not to be called a [...] "costume." [...] Some rules are for common sense courtesy: drums have special rules and should not be touched or played by those {{not a part of the}} drum group. People and their regalia should not be touched without permission. However, details of pow wow etiquette vary from one geographic region to another. Regardless of where the pow wow takes place geographically, when a person does not know the proper etiquette at that specific pow wow, it is best to remain quiet until there is a break and they can talk specifically to the staff or arena director. Proper etiquette is important for not only those attending the pow wows but for performers as well. Many of these rules have been in place for hundreds of years and many are new. They are always in a constant state of modification. Some rules for common sense courtesy include, all singers and dancers who are under the influence of drugs while performing will be disqualified. For dancers, when a song is finished, both feet must <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> yet the body can be in any position. Dancers must be in full dress and prepared to start within ten minutes of grand entry time. Dancers also must always keep in time with the drum beat and bells must be worn at all times. All singers must be seated ten minutes before grand entry time and there should be no fewer than three singers per drum and no more than 10. The United Tribes Pow Wow in North Dakota have used these regulations and more, as they apply to dancers and singers.|$|E
