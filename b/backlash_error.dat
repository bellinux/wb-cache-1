The system nonlinear vibration equations are created with piecewise <b>backlash</b> and general <b>errors.</b> Gill’s numerical integration algorithm is implemented in calculating the vibration equation sets. Based on cell-mapping method (CMM), two-dimensional dynamic domain planes {{have been developed}} and primarily focused on the parameters of <b>backlash,</b> transmission <b>error,</b> mesh frequency and damping ratio, and so forth. Solution demonstrates that Period-doubling bifurcation happens as the mesh frequency increases; moreover nonlinear discontinuous jump breaks the periodic orbit and also turns the periodic state into chaos suddenly. In transmission error planes, three cell groups which are Period- 1, Period- 4, and Chaos have been observed, and the boundary cells are the sensitive areas to dynamic response. Considering the parameter planes which consist of damping ratio associated with <b>backlash,</b> transmission <b>error,</b> mesh stiffness, and external load, the solution domain structure reveals that the system step into chaos undergoes Period-doubling cascade with Period- 2 m (m: integer) periodic regions.

40|$|Differential {{absorption}} lidar (DIAL) {{remote sensing}} is a promising technology for atmospheric CO 2 detection. However, stringent wavelength accuracy and stability are required in DIAL system. Accurate on-line wavelength calibration {{is a crucial}} procedure for retrieving atmospheric CO 2 concentration using the DIAL, particularly when pulsed lasers are adopted in the system. Large fluctuations in the intensities of a pulsed laser pose a great challenge for accurate on-line wavelength calibration. In this paper, a wavelength calibration strategy based on multi-wavelength scanning (MWS) was proposed for accurate on-line wavelength calibration of a pulsed laser for CO 2 detection. The MWS conducted segmented sampling across the CO 2 absorption line with appropriate number of points and range of widths by using a tunable laser. Complete absorption line of CO 2 can be obtained through a curve fitting. Then, the on-line wavelength can be easily found {{at the peak of}} the absorption line. Furthermore, another algorithm called the energy matching was introduced in the MWS to eliminate the <b>backlash</b> <b>error</b> of tunable lasers during the process of on-line wavelength calibration. Finally, a series of tests was conducted to elevate the calibration precision of MWS. Analysis of tests demonstrated that the MWS proposed in this paper could calibrate the on-line wavelength of pulsed laser accurately and steadily...|$|E
40|$|Radiation {{force balance}} {{approach}} is universally adopted and {{most widely used}} primary calibration method for total acoustic power radiated by an ultrasonic transducer. In this setup, the separation between the transducer and target (absorbing/reflecting) plays vital role in the overall measurement uncertainty of ultrasonic power due to attenuation of ultrasonic waves within the travel path. It becomes relatively more important at high frequencies as the ultrasonic attenuation {{is proportional to the}} square of frequency. Hence, the separation between the transducer and the target need to be measured with the best possible resolution and least uncertainty. In this article, two methods developed for transducer and target separation measurement have been described and compared. The first method uses displacement sensor in the feedback and controls stepper motor in micro stepping and adjust the separation with control program. It also uses the microbalance feedback approach to automatically detect the null (zero) distance. In the second approach, which does not use distance sensor in feedback and a triangle method is used to detect change in height. High torque stepper motor is used in micro-stepping mode to achieve best step resolution of one lm. Second method is free from error that cause due to electrical noise in sensor and has provision for <b>backlash</b> <b>error</b> correction.

A practical differential planetary gear train, which combines two inputs and one output, is studied using multi-body dynamics software.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop vibration-based fault detection strategies for on-line condition monitoring of gear transmission systems. The study divides the thesis into three sections. First of all, the local stresses created by a root fatigue crack on a pinion spur gear are analyzed using a quasi-static finite element model and non-linear contact mechanics simulation. Backlash between gear teeth which is essential to provide better lubrication on tooth surfaces and to eliminate interference is included as a defect and {{a necessary part of}} transmission design. The second section is dedicated to fixed axis power trains. Torsional vibration is shown to cause teeth separation and double-sided impacts in unloaded and lightly loaded gearing drives. The transient and steady-state dynamic loading on teeth within a two stage crank-slider mechanism arising from backlash and geometric manufacturing errors is investigated by utilizing a non-linear multi-body dynamics software model. The multi-body model drastically reduces the computation time required by finite element methods to simulate realistic operation. The gears are considered rigid with elastic contact surfaces defined by a penalty based non-linear contact formulation. The third section examines a practical differential planetary transmission which combines two inputs and one output. Planetary gears with only <b>backlash</b> <b>errors</b> are compared to those containing both backlash and tooth defects under different kinematic and loading conditions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work is to correct some {{inaccuracies}} of the paper "Bonori, G., Barbieri, M., Pellicano, F., 2008, Optimum Profile Modifications of Spur Gears by Means of Genetic Algorithms, Journal of Sound and Vibration, 313, pp. 603 - 616 "; in that work, the aim was the reduction of vibrations in spur gears by means of profile modifications. This goal was achieved by using an ad hoc genetic algorithm, where the objective function was the peak to peak or the harmonic content of the Static Transmission Error (STE) computed by Finite Element calculations.

5000|$|<b>Backlash</b> is the <b>error</b> {{in motion}} {{that occurs when}} gears change direction. It exists because there is always some gap between the {{trailing}} face of the driving tooth and the leading face of the tooth behind it on the driven gear, and that gap must be closed before force can be transferred in the new direction. The term [...] "backlash" [...] {{can also be used}} to refer to the size of the gap, not just the phenomenon it causes; thus, one could speak of a pair of gears as having, for example, [...] "0.1 mm of backlash." [...] A pair of gears could be designed to have zero backlash, but this would presuppose perfection in manufacturing, uniform thermal expansion characteristics throughout the system, and no lubricant. Therefore, gear pairs are designed to have some backlash. It is usually provided by reducing the tooth thickness of each gear by half the desired gap distance. In the case of a large gear and a small pinion, however, the backlash is usually taken entirely off the gear and the pinion is given full sized teeth. Backlash can also be provided by moving the gears further apart. The backlash of a gear train equals the sum of the backlash of each pair of gears, so in long trains backlash can become a problem.|$|R
40|$|This work {{develops}} a practical approach to explore rough environments when time is critical. The harsh environmental conditions prevent {{the use of}} range, force/torque or tactile sensors. A representative case is the mapping of oil wells. In these conditions, tactile exploration is appealing. In this work, the environment is mapped tactilely, by a manipulator whose only sensors are joint encoders. The robot autonomously explores the environment collecting few, sparse tactile data and monitoring its free movements. These data are {{used to create a}} model of the surface in real time and to choose the robot's movements to reduce the mapping time. First, the approach is described and its feasibility demonstrated. Real-time impedance control allows a robust robot movement and the detection of the surface using a manipulator mounting only position sensors. A representation based on geometric primitives describes the surface using the few, sparse data available. The robustness of the method is tested against surface roughness and different surrounding fluids. Joint backlash strongly affect the robot's precision, and it is inevitable because of the thermal expansion in the joints. Here, a new strategy is developed to compensate for <b>backlash</b> positioning <b>errors,</b> by simultaneously identifying the surface and the backlash values. Second, an exploration strategy to map a constraining environment with a manipulator is developed. To maximize the use of the acquired data, this work proposes a hybrid approach involving both workspace and configuration space. The amount of knowledge of the environment is evaluated with an approach based on information theory, and the robot's movements are chosen to maximize the expected increase of such knowledge. Since the robot only possesses position sensors, the location along the robot where contact with the surface occurs cannot be determined with certainty. Thus a new approach is developed, that evaluates the probability of contact with specific parts of the robot and classifies and uses the data according to the different types of contact. This work is validated with simulations and experiments with a prototype manipulator specifically designed for this application. by Francesco Mazzini. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|A {{completely}} new method of non-contacting, hostile environment displacement and strain measurement {{based on the}} focus and scanning of x-rays, has been developed and demonstrated. The new technique {{has the ability to}} overcome many of the limitations associated with available methods. The system is based on the focus and scanning of low energy, hard x-rays such as those emanating from table top copper or molybdenum sources. The x-rays are focused into a narrow and intense line image which can be swept onto targets that fluoresce secondary x-ray radiation. By monitoring the secondary radiation intensity and comparing it with the focused x-ray image's position as it is swept over the target edge, the position of the target edge relative to the focused image can be determined.

Strain measurements have been conducted in a laboratory environment at both room temperature and at a specimen temperature of 1300 degrees Fahrenheit, with an accuracy of within 20 microstrain (primarily a function of the 0. 5 micron resolution limit).

40|$|One of {{the most}} common goals in {{manufacturing}} is to improve the quality and accuracy of the parts being fabricated without reducing productivity. Aiming at this goal, many different manufacturing processes have been developed. Among them, machining {{plays a major role in}} increasing product accuracy. As an important machining process, grinding is a vital step that can produce both fine finish and dimensional accuracy for applications in which the workpiece material is either hard or brittle. Currently, the ball screw is the most frequently used setup for grinding machine tool feed drive. However, the existence of transmission components induces wear, high friction, backlash, and also lower system stiffness; therefore, applications of conventional feed drives for high speed and high accuracy machining are very limited. As a promising technology, a linear motor feed drive discards the transmission system; therefore, it eliminates transmission induced <b>error,</b> such as <b>backlash</b> and pitch <b>error,</b> and avoids stiffness reduction as well. As a result, a linear motor drive can achieve both high speed and high accuracy performance. A linear motor feed drive will be subject to external disturbances such as friction, force ripple and machining force. Due to the lack of a transmission unit, the tracking behavior of a linear motor feed drive is prone to be affected by external disturbances and model parameter variations. Thus, in order to deliver high performance, a controller should be capable of achieving high accuracy in the presence of external disturbance and parameter uncertainty. This dissertation proposes a general robust motion control framework for the CNC design of a linear motor feed drive to achieve high speed/high precision as well as low speed/high precision. An application to the linear motor feed drives in grinding machines was carried out. One of the developed algorithms is the HSMC, which combines the merits of a reaching law based sliding mode control and a modified disturbance observer for precision tracking to address the practical issues of friction, force ripple, and grinding force disturbances. Another algorithm presented is ASMC, which combines the reaching law based sliding mode control with adaptive disturbance estimation to achieve an adaptive robust motion control. Ph. D.
