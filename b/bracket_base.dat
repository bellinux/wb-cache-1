50|$|Incognito lingual {{brackets}} {{and wires}} {{are made by}} 3M company in Germany. These appliances were initially designed by Dr. Dirk Wiechmann. He published his results in 2003 in American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, where he reported testing these appliances for 18 months on 600 bonded arches on patients in his private practice. The company uses a CAD/CAM technology to combine bracket fabrication and bracket positioning which is done on computer models. The wires and brackets are customized to each patient's anatomy of the lingual tooth surface. The bases of these brackets are bigger than other brackets produced by different companies, however these appliances have thinner <b>bracket</b> <b>base</b> and use less bonding material than other brackets. This {{may be seen as}} an advantage by some due to low profile of brackets which may cause less irritation to the tongue of patients, but this does lead to creating 1st order bends in the wires to compensate for the low profile of these brackets. A study done in Germany in 2005, compared the pre-adjusted lingual brackets (Ormco) to customized lingual brackets (Incognito) on a group of 40 Germany speaking women. The results stated that customized brackets in the study induced significantly fewer cases of tongue space restriction, pressure sores, reddening or lesions to the tongue in the long term than the pre-fabricated brackets. Even though the results favor the Incognito appliance, it should be kept in mind that this is a subjective opinion of people which may confound the results.|$|E

This reduction results in less base surface area available for bonding with the concomitant clinical reality of increased debonding rates. Objectives: To compare the shear bond strength and to evaluate and compare the surface design characteristics (mesh type, mesh wire size) of different commercially available direct bonding metal brackets. Materials and methods: Maxillary first premolar brackets of six different manufacturing companies were bonded on freshly extracted human premolars preserved in artificial saliva, with the same adhesive and then debonded using a universal testing machine. The <b>bracket</b> <b>bases</b> were also examined under the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results: The bond strength obtained with different commercially available <b>bracket</b> <b>bases</b> was stastically variable. The size of <b>bracket</b> <b>bases</b> influenced the shear bond strength values. The mesh size and its configuration also affect the bond strength.

30|$|These {{results do}} not agree with the results of Kula et al. [3], Wong and Power [4], and Verstrynge et al. [5], who {{reported}} that both approaches proved to be equally effective. This outcome might be due to the distinctive X-shaped adhesive application on the <b>bracket</b> <b>base.</b> When this type of bracket is placed and pressed onto the tooth, the X-shaped adhesive material may not homogenously spread over the entire <b>bracket</b> <b>base</b> and the enamel. This might result in gap formation at the tooth-adhesive-bracket complex, weakening the bonds. Subsequently, the seeping and leaking of oral fluids and microorganisms into these gaps may further undermine these bonds [14, 15]. Matasa [16] stated that adhesives are “eaten away” by microorganisms and concluded that this occurrence may possibly be a culprit for bond failure.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the shear bond strength of metallic brackets bonded with Right-On composite under different enamel conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five bovine permanent lower incisors were used, and {{were divided into}} three groups (n = 15). For group 1 (control), the bonding procedures were performed by using Transbond XT according to the manufacturer?s recommendations, that is 37 % phosphoric acid etching, washing, drying, application of primer XT and, finally, the bonding procedure itself. For the other two groups, the brackets were bonded by using the Right-On composite. The bonding procedures for group 2 were performed according to the manufacturer?s recommendations, that is 37 % phosphoric acid etching, application of the composite activation liquid, both on the etched surface and the <b>bracket?s</b> <b>base,</b> and insertion of the composite on the <b>bracket?s</b> <b>base</b> and <b>bracket</b> positioning.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of orthodontic <b>bracket</b> <b>base</b> shape on shear bond strength and adhesive remnant index. In this in vitro study using 140 bovine incisors, shear bond strength (SBS) of brackets with different base shapes (rectangle, flower, round, heart, diamond, star, and football) were measured with an Instron testing machine and tested until bond failure. Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) scoring was evaluated after debonding to evaluate the location of bond failure. Descriptive and one-way ANOVA post-hoc Tukey statistical analyses were performed with a statistical significance set at p? 0. 05. Statistically significant difference in mean SBS in Newtons was observed for multiple base shapes (p< 0. 05). The highest mean SBS (N ± SD) was observed in football and flower base shapes (73. 83 N ± 53. 46; 65. 82 N ± 37. 89 respectively); the lowest mean was observed with diamond and heart shapes (30. 51 N ± 11. 73; 33. 28 N ± 16. 89 respectively). When reported in Megaspascals, statistically significant difference was observed for rectangle base shape (3. 54 MPa ± 2. 69) when compared to all other base shapes. <b>Bracket</b> <b>base</b> shape has an effect on SBS. Higher SBS (N) for rectangle, flower, and football base shape indicates even stress distributions throughout the <b>bracket</b> <b>base.</b> Base shape with a pronounced converging tip over the axial plane may contribute to the reduction in SBS due to increased peak stress concentration resulting in bond failure...|$|E
30|$|After SBS testing, it is {{important}} to determine the site of material failure and measure the ARI scores, using the system developed by Artun and Bergland [33], which helps standardize bond failure analysis. The site of failure provides information regarding the quality of the bond between the adhesive and the tooth, and between the adhesive and the <b>bracket</b> <b>base</b> [43]. By microscopic observation, debonding of the Silorane composite occurred mainly with {{less than half of the}} bonding resin remained on the tooth, (ARI =  1), compared with more than half (ARI =  2) for conventional orthodontic adhesives like Transbond XT (Table  2). These findings suggest that epoxy base resin composites (Silorane) did not bond to the <b>bracket</b> <b>base</b> as effectively as conventional orthodontic adhesives. An important requirement of an orthodontic adhesive is its ability to debond by clear separation from the enamel surface, leaving no residue, which facilitates debonding and subsequent polishing. Increased bond strength is associated with higher ARI scores [44]. Conversely, retention of all resin on the tooth (ARI =  3), such as occurred 60.1  % of the time with the Venus Diamond composite, could be clinically advantageous compared with debonding with the concomitant removal of enamel fragments, which damages tooth surfaces. A significant correlation exists between residual adhesive and the surface appearance after cleanup [45]. Bond failure at the enamel-adhesive interface was suggested to be an advantage, because it reduced the amount of residual adhesive, the need for a rotary instrument for cleanup and therefore, the incidence of subsequent iatrogenic injury [45]. However, these scores depend not only on the adhesive bond strength but also on many other factors, including <b>bracket</b> <b>base</b> design, etching procedures, and adhesive type [46].|$|E

40|$|Introduction: For orthodontists, {{the ideal}} bonding {{material}} {{should be less}} moisture-sensitive and should release fluoride, thereby reducing unfavorable iatrogenic decalcification. Resin-Modified Glass Ionomer Cements (RMGICs), due {{to their ability to}} bond in the presence of saliva and blood can be a very good bonding agent for orthodontic attachments especially in the areas of mouth, which are difficult to access. Moreover, their fluoride releasing property makes them an ideal bonding agent for patients with poor oral hygiene. However, their immediate bond strength is said to be too low to immediately ligate the initial wire, which could increase the total number of appointments. The effect of sandblasting and the use of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCL) on the immediate bond failure of RMGIC clinically have not been reported in the literature until the date. This investigation intended to assess the effect of sandblasting (of the <b>bracket</b> <b>base</b> and enamel) and NaOCL on the rate of bond failure (with immediate ligation at 30 min) of Fuji Ortho LC and its comparison with that of conventional light cured composite resin over a period of 1 year.
