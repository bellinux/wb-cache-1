5|$|Like other requiem sharks, {{the nervous}} shark is viviparous: once the embryos exhaust their initial supply of yolk, they are {{provisioned}} {{by the mother}} through a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac. Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. The male bites {{at the sides of}} the female as a prelude to mating. After mating, the female stores the sperm for approximately four weeks prior to fertilization. In Darwin Harbor, mating occurs from January to March and <b>birthing</b> occurs in October and November following a gestation period of eight to nine months. In Shark Bay, mating occurs from late October to early November and <b>birthing</b> occurs around the same time the following year, following a gestation period of 11 months; this slower development likely reflects the cooler temperatures of Shark Bay.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the walrus, which has five- to six-year-long inter-birth intervals, female pinnipeds enter estrous shortly after they give birth. All species go through delayed implantation, wherein the embryo remains in suspended development for weeks or months before it is implanted in the uterus. Delayed implantation postpones the birth of young until the female hauls-out on land or until conditions for <b>birthing</b> are favorable. Gestation in seals (including delayed implantation) typically lasts a year. For most species, <b>birthing</b> takes place {{in the spring and summer}} months. Typically, single pups are born; twins are uncommon and have high mortality rates. Pups of most species are born precocial. Unlike terrestrial mammals, pinniped milk has little to no lactose.|$|E
5|$|For {{temperate}} living bats, births typically {{take place}} in May or June in the northern hemisphere while births in the southern hemisphere occur in November and December. Tropical species give birth {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season. In most bat species, female carry and give birth to one pup per litter. For bat embryos, apoptosis only affects the hindlimbs, while the forelimbs retain webbing between the digits which form into the wing membranes. At birth, a bat pup can be up to 40 percent of the mother's weight, and hence the pelvic girdle of the female expands during birth as the two halves are connected by a flexible ligament. Females typically give birth in a heads-up or horizontal position, using gravity to make <b>birthing</b> easier. The young emerges rear-first, possibly to prevent the wings from getting tangled, and the females cradles it in her wing and tail membranes. In many species, females give birth and raise their young in maternity colonies and individuals may assist others in their <b>birthing</b> process.|$|E

5|$|As {{the park}} is a {{national}} nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest, all dog owners are required to keep their dogs under control while in the park. This includes not allowing their dog to disturb other park users or disrupt wildlife. In 2009, after some incidents leading {{to the death of}} wildfowl, the park's dogs-on-leads policy was extended. Park users are said to believe that the deer are feeling increasingly threatened by the growing number of dogs using the park and Royal Parks advises against walking dogs in the park during the deer's <b>birthing</b> season.|$|E
5|$|Inhabiting {{the shallow}} coastal {{waters of the}} central and western Indo-Pacific, the winghead shark feeds on small bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. It gives birth to live young, with the {{developing}} embryos receiving nourishment through a placental connection. Females produce annual litters of 6 to 25 pups; depending on region, <b>birthing</b> may occur from February to June after a gestation period of 8–11 months. This harmless species is widely fished for meat, fins, liver oil, and fishmeal. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as Endangered in 2016, as it {{is thought to have}} declined in some parts of its range due to overfishing.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the copper shark is viviparous, in which the yolk sac of the {{developing}} embryo, once depleted, is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment.

In the Southern Hemisphere, mating takes place from October to December (spring and early summer), when both sexes have migrated into offshore waters at higher latitudes. <b>Birthing</b> seems to occur from June to January, peaking in October and November.|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{accuracy}} of maternally reported <b>birth</b> weights, we compared <b>birth</b> weights reported by mothers in the Tennessee Women, Infants, and Children Supplemental Feeding Program (WIC) from 1975 to 1984 with the <b>birth</b> weights recorded on the corresponding Tennessee <b>birth</b> certificate file. Differences in <b>birth</b> weights between these two sources were compared for the total group and were also stratified by sociodemographic and medical variables that might influence {{the accuracy of}} <b>birth</b> weight recall. An accurate <b>birth</b> weight was defined as one reported within 1 ounce of the <b>birth</b> certificate <b>birth</b> weight. We also calculated the proportion of <b>birth</b> weights that would be incorrectly classified as low or normal by maternal reporting. A total of 72, 245 WIC records were matched with their corresponding <b>birth</b> certificates. Of these, 46, 637 had WIC <b>birth</b> weights recorded within the specified <b>birth</b> weight range. Eighty-nine percent of <b>birth</b> weights were reported within 1 ounce of <b>birth</b> certificate <b>birth</b> weights. Lower accuracy of <b>birth</b> weight reporting {{was associated with the}} infant's low <b>birth</b> weight, preterm delivery, and low Apgar scores, and with the mother's grand multiparity, less than a high school education, black race, single marital status, and young age.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Parity is a {{risk factor}} in {{neonatal}} morbidity and mortality. This dissertation examined the association between first <b>births</b> and selected <b>birth</b> defects. The first aim {{was to assess the}} risk of 66 <b>birth</b> defects among first <b>births</b> and third or greater <b>births.</b> The second aim was to determine if maternal race, maternal age, infant sex or infant <b>birth</b> weight modify the association between first <b>births</b> and selected <b>birth</b> defects. METHODS: The Texas <b>Birth</b> Defects Registry provided data for 1999 - 2009. For the first aim, odds ratios were calculated for each <b>birth</b> defect. For the second aim, analysis was restricted to the ten <b>birth</b> defects significantly associated with first <b>births.</b> Stratified analyses were conducted and interaction terms were added to logistic regression models to assess whether differences in the odds ratios for the effect of first <b>birth</b> were statistically significant across strata. RESULTS: Findings for the first aim showed that first <b>births</b> had significantly increased odds of having an infant with 24 of the 66 <b>birth</b> defects. Third or greater <b>births</b> had significantly increased odds of having four of the 66 <b>birth</b> defects. For the second aim, a number of significant effect modifiers were observed. For patent ductus arteriosis, obstructive urinary defects and gastroschisis, the effect of first <b>births</b> was significantly modified by black or U. S. -born Hispanic mothers. The effect of first <b>birth</b> was also significantly modified among mothers ≥ 30 years for mitral valve insufficiency, atrial septal defect and congenital hip dislocation. The effect of first <b>births</b> was significantly modified among infants with low <b>birth</b> weight for hypospadias, congenital hip dislocation and gastroschisis. CONCLUSIONS: First <b>births</b> were associated with an elevated risk of 24 categories of <b>birth</b> defects. For some of the <b>birth</b> defects studied, the effect of first <b>birth</b> is modified by maternal age, maternal race and low <b>birth</b> weight. Knowledge of the increased risk for <b>birth</b> defects among women having their first <b>birth</b> allows physicians and midwives to provide better patient care and spur further research into the etiology of associated <b>birth</b> defects. This knowledge may bring about interventions prior to conception in populations most likely to conceive. ...|$|R
5|$|Spotted eagle rays, {{in common}} with many other rays, often fall victim to sharks such as the tiger shark, the lemon shark, the bull shark, the silver tip shark, and the great hammerhead shark. A great hammerhead shark has been {{observed}} attacking a spotted eagle ray in open water by taking a large bite {{out of one of}} its pectoral fins, thus incapacitating the ray. The shark then used its head to pin the ray to the bottom and pivoted to take the ray in its jaws, head first.

5|$|Swimming {{behavior}} in mantas differs across habitats: when travelling over deep water, they swim {{at a constant}} rate in a straight line, while further inshore they usually bask or swim idly around. Mantas may travel alone or in groups of up to 50. They may associate with other fish species as well as sea birds and marine mammals. Mantas sometimes breach, leaping partially or entirely out of the water. Individuals in a group may make aerial jumps one after the other. These leaps come in three forms: forward leaps where the fish lands head first, similar jumps with a tail first re-entry or somersaults. The reason for breaching is not known; possible explanations include mating rituals, <b>birthing,</b> communication, or the removal of parasites and commensal remoras (suckerfish).|$|E

40|$|Background: Encouraging {{institutional}} <b>birth</b> is {{an important}} component of reducing maternal mortality in low-resource settings. This study aims to identify and understand the determinants of persistently low institutional <b>birth</b> in rural Nepal, with the goal of informing future interventions to reduce high rates of maternal mortality. Methods: Postpartum women giving <b>birth</b> in the catchment area population of a district-level hospital in the Far-Western Development Region of Nepal were invited to complete a cross-sectional survey in 2012 about their recent <b>birth</b> experience. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to determine the institutional <b>birth</b> rate, social and demographic predictors of institutional <b>birth,</b> and barriers to institutional <b>birth.</b> Results: The institutional <b>birth</b> rate for the hospital's catchment area population was calculated to be 0. 30 (54 home <b>births,</b> 23 facility <b>births).</b> Institutional <b>birth</b> was more likely as age decreased (ORs in the range of 0. 20 - 0. 28) and as income increased (ORs in the range of 1. 38 - 1. 45). Institutional <b>birth</b> among women who owned land was less likely (OR = 0. 82 [0. 71, 0. 92]). Ninety percent of participants in the institutional <b>birth</b> group identified safety and good care as the most important factors determining location of <b>birth,</b> whereas 60 % of participants in the home <b>birth</b> group reported distance from hospital as a key determinant of location of <b>birth.</b> Qualitative analysis elucidated the importance of social support, financial resources, <b>birth</b> planning, awareness of services, perception of safety, and referral capacity in achieving an institutional <b>birth.</b> Conclusion: Age, income, and land ownership, but not patient preference, were key predictors of institutional <b>birth.</b> Most women believed that <b>birth</b> at the hospital was safer regardless of where they gave <b>birth.</b> Future interventions to increase rates of institutional <b>birth</b> should address structural barriers including differences in socioeconomic status, social support, transportation resources, and <b>birth</b> preparedness...|$|R
5|$|Wildebeest do {{not form}} {{permanent}} pair bonds {{and during the}} mating season, or rut, the males establish temporary territories and try to attract females into them. These small territories are about 3000 m2, with up to 300 territories per km2. The males defend these territories from other males while competing for females that are coming into season. The males use grunts and distinctive behaviour to entice females into their territories. Wildebeest usually breed {{at the end of}} the rainy season when the animals are well fed and at their peak of fitness. This usually occurs between May and July, and <b>birthing</b> usually takes place between January and March, at the start of the wet season. Wildebeest females breed seasonally and ovulate spontaneously.|$|E
5|$|Active and schooling, {{the black}} dogfish is an {{opportunistic}} predator and scavenger that mainly consumes bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing litters {{of four to}} 40 pups that are sustained to term by a yolk sac. There is no well-defined breeding season, and mating and <b>birthing</b> take place year-round. The black dogfish contributes significantly to the bycatch of deep-sea commercial fisheries operating in the North Atlantic; it is of little commercial value and is usually discarded. As large portions of its range see little deepwater fishing activity and its northwestern Atlantic population seems to be stable, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed this species under Least Concern overall. It has been assessed as Near Threatened in the northeastern Atlantic, where its numbers may have declined from heavy fishing pressure.|$|E
5|$|Complex taboos and rites are {{associated}} with a woman's first childbirth. When about to give birth she is secluded in a special <b>birthing</b> house called a komby. The leaves she eats from and the waste produced by the newborn are kept in a special receptacle for seven days, at which point they are burned. The ash produced is rubbed on the forehead and cheeks of the mother and baby and must be worn for seven days. On the fifteenth day both are bathed in water in which lime or lemon leaves have been soaked. This ritual is called ranom-boahangy (bath of the leaves). The community gathers to drink rum and celebrate with wrestling matches, but the mother must stay in the komby. She is not allowed to consume anything other than saonjo greens and a chicken specially prepared for her. After this celebration she is required to leave the komby and can return to routine life.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND:Infant {{mortality}} {{has traditionally}} been analyzed {{as a function of}} <b>birth</b> weight and <b>birth</b> weight-specific mortality. Often, however, when comparing two populations, the population with higher overall mortality has lower mortality at low <b>birth</b> weights and a reversed pattern at higher <b>birth</b> weights. Methods standardizing <b>birth</b> weight, such as the "relative <b>birth</b> weight", have been proposed to eliminate these crossover effects, but such methods do not account for the separate contributions to <b>birth</b> weight of gestational age and fetal "growth. "METHODS:Using data for singleton U. S. Blacks (n = 3, 683, 572) and Whites (n = 18, 409, 287), we compared neonatal mortality, gestational age, and the difference between the observed <b>birth</b> weight and the optimal <b>birth</b> weight (the weight at which neonatal mortality was lowest) among Black and White infants at the same relative <b>birth</b> weight. RESULTS:At relative <b>birth</b> weights below zero, gestational ages were, on average, 2. 4 ± 1. 5 (mean ± standard deviation) weeks shorter for Blacks than for Whites for the same relative <b>birth</b> weight. At relative <b>birth</b> weights above zero, no differences were observed in gestational age, but the optimal <b>birth</b> weight occurred at a much higher relative <b>birth</b> weight in Whites than in Blacks (4150 vs. 3550 g).

5|$|The diet of the short-tail {{stingray}} {{consists of}} invertebrates and bony fishes, including burrowing and midwater species. It tends to remain within a relatively limited area throughout the year, preferring deeper waters during the winter, {{and is not}} known to perform long migrations. Large aggregations of rays form seasonally at certain locations, {{such as in the}} summer at the Poor Knight Islands off New Zealand. Both <b>birthing</b> and mating have been documented within the aggregations at Poor Knights. This species is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother; the litter size is 6–10. The short-tail stingray is not aggressive but is capable of inflicting a potentially lethal wound with its long, venomous sting. It is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range, usually surviving to be released. Because its population does not appear threatened by human activity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The summer aggregations of the short-tail {{stingray}} at the Poor Knights Islands seem to {{at least}} partly serve a reproductive purpose, as both mating and <b>birthing</b> have been observed among the gathered rays. Courtship and mating take place in mid-water, {{and it has been}} speculated that the rising current flowing continuously through the narrow archways aids the rays in maintaining their position. Each receptive female may be followed by several males, who attempt to bite and grip her disc. One or two males may be dragged by the female for hours before she accedes; the successful male flips upside-down beneath her, inserting one of his claspers into her vent and rhythmically waving his tail from side to side. Copulation lasts 3–5 minutes. Females in captivity have been observed mating with up to three different males in succession.|$|E

5|$|The diet of the pelagic {{stingray}} consists of free-swimming invertebrates and bony fishes. It {{is an active}} hunter, using its pectoral fins to trap and move food to its mouth, and {{has been known to}} take advantage of seasonal feeding opportunities such as spawning squid. Like other stingrays, it is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the embryos are sustained initially by yolk and later by histotroph ("uterine milk"). With a short gestation period of 24 months, females may bear two litters of 413 pups per year. <b>Birthing</b> generally occurs in warm water near the equator, {{with the exception of the}} Mediterranean Sea, with the timing varying between regions. Rarely encountered except by fishery workers, the {{pelagic stingray}} can inflict a severe, even fatal wound with its tail spine. This species is caught as bycatch throughout its range; it is of little economic value and usually discarded, often with high mortality. However, there is evidence that its numbers are increasing, perhaps owing to the heavy fishing of its natural predators and competitors (e.g., sharks). Along with the pelagic stingray's global distribution and prolific life history, this has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|With a {{gestation}} period estimated {{at up to}} 2224 months and a one-year resting period between pregnancies, female dusky sharks bear at most one litter of young every three years. The litter size ranges from 3 to 16, with 6 to 12 being typical, and does not correlate with female size. Sharks in the western Atlantic tend to produce slightly smaller litters than those from the southeastern Atlantic (averaging 8 versus 10 pups per litter). Depending on region, <b>birthing</b> may occur throughout the year or over a span of several months: newborn sharks have been reported from late winter to summer in the northwestern Atlantic, in summer and fall off Western Australia, and throughout the year with a peak in fall off southern Africa. Females move into shallow inshore habitats such as lagoons to give birth, as such areas offer their pups rich food supplies and shelter from predation (including from their own species), and leave immediately afterward.
