5000|$|Satyrium abdominalis (Gerhard, 1850) - Gerhard's <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The Gerhard's <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak</b> is {{a common}} species in Turkey.|$|E
50|$|The Gerhard's <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak</b> prefers bushy rocky {{slopes and}} ravines.|$|E
50|$|Brampton Wood has {{thriving}} {{colonies of}} <b>black</b> <b>hairstreaks,</b> one of Britainâ€™s rarest butterflies. The butterfly survives due to careful {{management of the}} rides. This involves trimming the scrub at times in the year when the population can cope. Brown argus, white admiral and purple hairstreak can also be spotted at Brampton Wood.|$|R
50|$|Hypolycaena nigra, the <b>black</b> fairy <b>hairstreak,</b> is a {{butterfly}} in the Lycaenidae family. It {{was described by}} George Bethune-Baker in 1914. It is found in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria (south and the Cross River loop), Cameroon, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Mongala, Uele, Ituri, Kivu, Tshopo, Tshuapa, Sankuru and Lualaba), Uganda and north-western Tanzania. The habitat consists of forests.|$|R
50|$|This {{traditional}} {{hay meadow}} has over 100 plant species, including lady's bedstraw, green winged orchids and cuckooflowers. It also has {{many species of}} butterfly, such as orange tip and rare <b>black</b> and brown <b>hairstreaks.</b> other wildlife includes brown hares, kestrels and moths.|$|R
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak</b> (Satyrium pruni) is a {{butterfly}} {{in the family}} Lycaenidae.|$|E
50|$|Satyrium abdominalis, the Gerhard's <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak,</b> is a {{butterfly}} {{in the family}} Lycaenidae.|$|E
50|$|The site is ash {{and maple}} {{woodland}} on heavy clay, a habitat {{which has become}} scarce in lowland England. It also has areas of damp grassland, and a grassland valley. It is an important site for butterflies, including the rare <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak.</b>|$|E
50|$|The foliage is {{sometimes}} eaten by the larvae of Lepidoptera, including emperor moth, willow beauty, white-pinion spotted, common emerald, November moth, pale November moth, mottled pug, green pug, brimstone moth, feathered thorn, brown-tail, yellow-tail, short-cloaked moth, lesser yellow underwing, lesser broad-bordered yellow underwing, double square-spot, <b>black</b> and brown <b>hairstreaks,</b> hawthorn moth (Scythropia crataegella) and the case-bearer moth Coleophora anatipennella. Dead blackthorn wood provides {{food for the}} caterpillars of the concealer moth Esperia oliviella.|$|R
50|$|This {{site has}} ash and maple woodland, and dense {{blackthorn}} scrub. It {{is described by}} Natural England {{as one of the}} most important sites in Britain for the <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak</b> butterfly, which requires a habitat of prunus species such as blackthorn. The scrub also provides nesting sites for nightingales.|$|E
50|$|The {{wood was}} {{formerly}} part of Bernwood Forest, a medieval royal hunting forest. Most {{of the site}} is ancient pedunculate oak forest, which has butterflies including the rare wood white and <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak.</b> There is also an area of rough grassland and scrub which is crossed by the River Ray.|$|E
5000|$|Lord <b>Black</b> <b>Hairstreak</b> is the {{antagonist}} of the story. He {{is determined}} {{to be in control}} of the Faerie Realm using any possible means. He is also uncle to Comma, as his mother was Hairstreak's sister, but not to Blue and Pyrgus as their mother died and Apatura Iris remarried.|$|E
50|$|Ocaria ocrisia, the <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak</b> or Hewitson's blackstreak, is a {{butterfly}} of the Lycaenidae family. It {{was described by}} William Chapman Hewitson in 1868. It is found from Mexico to Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, Ecuador and Argentina. It has also been recorded from southern Arizona. The habitat consists of rainforests at altitudes ranging from 200 to 900 meters.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{broadleaved oak}} {{woodland}} on north Buckinghamshire clay, with an understorey of hazel and blackthorn. Herbs include primrose and wood anemone, and small streams and wide rides provide additional habitats. The woods have 35 butterfly species, including the rare <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak.</b> There were five species of fritillary, but some {{have not been}} seen since the late 1970s. Breeding birds include nightingales.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} ancient pedunculate oak {{woodland}} with diverse ground flora, typical breeding birds and some uncommon invertebrates. It {{is located on}} very poorly drained Oxford clay in the Vale of Aylesbury, {{and there are many}} small streams. Much of the woods have been woodland has been coppiced. Wet areas have maple and ash. The ground flora is dominated by brambles and bluebells. Invertebrates include the rare <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak</b> butterfly and ground-hopper tetrix subulata.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{semi-natural}} woodland {{which is}} {{recorded in the}} thirteenth century, and possibly the eleventh century. Ancient large oak trees may reflect a medieval past as a deer park. It is poorly drained on clay, causing seasonal waterlogging, with some areas which are drier. Loughton Brook runs along the boundary. There is {{a wide variety of}} trees and shrubs, and almost three hundred species of moths have been recorded. Butterflies include the nationally rare <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak.</b>|$|E
50|$|The site is {{woodland}} on clay, {{and although}} most {{of it has been}} coppiced at different times, it has a varied structure, and rich variety of flora and invertebrates. These factors, together with the presence of wild service trees, show that the woods are ancient. The main tree is oak, with and understorey which includes wych elm, crab apple and guelder rose. Flowers include primroses and bluebells, and in wetter areas there are ragged robin and marsh bedstraw. The woods have the largest British breeding colony of the nationally rare <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak</b> butterfly.|$|E
50|$|Grendon Underwood once bordered Bernwood Forest, {{the nearest}} {{remnants}} {{of which are}} now Grendon and Doddershall Woods, which are detached from the village itself by approx 500 metres. Both woods are now silvicultural and classified as ancient forest and are sites of special scientific interest (SSSI's). This offers protected status {{to some of the}} endangered species of animals residing therein such as Bechstein's bats, and nightingales. There are also 35 species of butterflies such as purple emperor, brown hairstreak, <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak,</b> wood white, the silver washed fritillary, high brown fritillary, marsh fritillary, pearl-bordered fritillary and small pearly-bordered fritillary.|$|E
5000|$|The site is ancient {{woodland}} {{on heavy}} clay soils {{which are often}} waterlogged. The invertebrate fauna are described by Natural England as [...] "exceptional", including over thirty butterfly species, such as the nationally rare <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak</b> and the scarce wood white and purple emperor. The woodland is wet ash and maple, with other trees including elm and hornbeam. The understorey has species indicative of long tree cover, such as Poa nemoralis and wood millet. There are many common breeding birds and in the ponds and ditches there are breeding smooth and great crested newts. The railway cutting is dominated by upright brome grass.|$|E
50|$|Note that {{information}} on this species applies to Great Britain and some details may not {{be consistent with the}} species in other parts of its range.This small brown butterfly is very similar to the white-letter hairstreak but the <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak</b> has a row of orange spots {{along the edge of the}} upper-side hindwing. In the female these spots also extend to the forewings. The undersides are similar to the white-letter but the white line tends to be straighter and the orange border extends onto the forewings. The most conclusive way to distinguish the two is by the row of black spots accompanying the orange band which the white-letter hairstreak never has. They spend most of their lives in the canopy or in dense scrub, feeding on honeydew, and very rarely come down to ground level.|$|E
5000|$|A dark little {{butterfly}} that {{spends the}} majority of its life in the tree tops, feeding on honeydew, making it best observed through binoculars. The uppersides are a dark brown with a small orange spot in the bottom corner of the hindwing. The male has a small pale spot on the forewings made up of scent scales. The undersides are a lighter brown with a thin white line, the [...] "hairstreak", which gives this group of butterflies their name. On the hindwing this streak zigzags to form a letter W (or M) from which this species gets its name. The outer edge of the hindwing has an orange border, but there is no orange on the forewings as on the similar <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak</b> and there are two short tails on the hindwings. Part of a group known as [...] "lateral baskers", they always rest with their wings closed.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} PatchMapper, a model combining {{a population}} simulator based on individual behaviour, with a spatially explicit {{representation of a}} landscape. To investigate the robustness of the technique, representatives of three major taxa were modelled: the nuthatch (Sitta europaea L.), the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus Rafinesque) and the <b>black</b> <b>hairstreak</b> (Satyrium pruni L.). For the nuthatch and white-footed mouse, the performance of PatchMapper was compared with published models of the same species, but using different approaches, including, for the nuthatch, a comparison against observed numbers in a real landscape. To investigate the behaviour of the model, a sensitivity analysis was also undertaken. Written in Java, for portability, the model enables the user to select demographic and behavioural parameters via an interactive interface and includes a real-time (computer) display {{of the position of}} individuals during the simulation. Novel aspects of the model include perceptual range and field-of-view. Internally generated neutral landscapes can be used for modelling general cases, with imported digitised landscapes enabling specific study areas to be modelled. Habitat area and habitat quality dynamics can also be modelled. Dispersal flow diagrams can be generated, providing a visual explanation of the effects of landscape changes on inter-patch dispersal paths and populations in target patches. Performance compared well with published models, predicting a feasible match with observed numbers of nuthatches in the real landscape. Revealing predictable and realistic responses, the sensitivity analysis revealed that the model coding was valid. The value of specific case studies was illustrated, along with the dangers of relying on intuition when evaluating the response of species to habitat fragmentation. The individual-based SEPM approach was found to be best suited to the modelling of univoltine territorial species (such as nuthatch), with a single dispersal phase between fledging and territorial establishment. When demonstrating the model, the visual outputs proved particularly effective. Providing a set of features not seen in published models and enabling modelling at both local and landscape scales, PatchMapper is offered as a prediction tool for those engaged in activities such as biodiversity conservation and habitat managemen...|$|E
