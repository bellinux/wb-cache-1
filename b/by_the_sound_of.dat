5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the final, the three finalists and Lloyd Webber visited Salzburg to visit some of the {{locations}} made famous <b>by</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> Music, including Leopoldskron Palace and Nonnberg Abbey, to give the finalists a chance to understand the real Maria von Trapp.|$|E
5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden {{building was}} constructed each year, called Dover Castle, from which gunfire salutes were sounded during the competitions. Competitors were {{summoned to the}} hillside <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a hunting horn, {{to take part in}} various sports. Mounted cannons were fired to begin the events, which included horse-racing, coursing with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, sledgehammer throwing, fighting with swords and cudgels, quarterstaff, and wrestling. Prizes included silver trophies for the mounted sports, and perhaps also money for the other events.|$|E
5|$|As {{the elder}} sibling, Durga cares for Apu with motherly affection, but spares no {{opportunity}} to tease him. Together, they share the simple joys of life: sitting quietly under a tree, viewing pictures in a travelling vendor's bioscope, running after the candy man who passes through the village, and watching a jatra (folk theatre) performed by a troupe of actors. Every evening they are delighted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a distant train's whistle. One day, they {{run away from home}} {{to catch a glimpse of}} the train, only to discover Indir lying dead on their return.|$|E

5|$|Cooper is woken early <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> {{a raucous}} {{party in the}} Great Northern Hotel. He leaves to meet Truman, while Jerry Horne (David Patrick Kelly) meets his brother Benjamin (Richard Beymer) to discuss the new Icelandic investors in their {{property}} developments. Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) arrives, disoriented and wishing to return to work, but the Hornes send him home. Cooper, Truman and Doctor Hayward (Warren Frost) discuss Johnson's bloodied shirt, learning that the blood is not Laura's but that of drug smuggler Jacques Renault.|$|E
5|$|Manne {{had strong}} {{preferences}} in {{his choice of}} drum set. Those preferences, however, changed several times over his career. He began with Gretsch drums. In 1957, intrigued <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a kind of drum made by Leedy (then owned by Slingerland), he had a line made for him that also became popular with other drummers. In the 1970s, after trying and abandoning many others for reasons of sound or maintainability, he settled on the Japanese-made Pearl Drums.|$|E
5|$|Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky and Ave Maria by Franz Schubert. At midnight {{the devil}} Chernabog awakes and summons evil spirits and restless souls from their graves to Bald Mountain. The spirits dance and {{fly through the}} air until driven back <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> an Angelus bell as night fades into dawn. A chorus is heard singing Ave Maria as a line of robed monks is {{depicted}} walking with lighted torches through a forest and into {{the ruins of a}} cathedral.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of {{industrial}} whaling, great whales {{may have been the}} major food source for killer whales. The introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided killer whales <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> exploding harpoons indicating availability of prey to scavenge, and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the toll on great whale populations by unfettered whaling had possibly reduced their availability as prey for killer whales, and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to their decline as well.|$|E
5|$|Public {{reaction}} to the Emperor's speech varied–many Japanese simply listened to it, then went {{on with their lives}} as best they could, while some Army and Navy officers chose suicide over surrender. At a base north of Nagasaki, some Japanese Army officers, enraged at the prospect of surrender, pulled some 16 captured American airmen out of the base prison and hacked them to death with swords. A large, weeping crowd gathered in front of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, with their cries sometimes interrupted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> gunshots as military officers present committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} morning, Rasminah is awakened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a guitar, {{played by}} the house's owner, Hoesin (Djoemala). Afraid that he is collaborating with her pursuer, she sneaks outside, only to be confronted by Parta and Doel. Retreating, she is chased by the pair. Hoesin intervenes and, after a fierce fight, defeats the two and chases them away. He then reassures Rasminah and escorts her home.|$|E

5|$|The song {{begins with}} a {{distinctly}} Vivaldian style, as the fast tempo and classical-style chord progression anticipates the lyrics to follow. The opening chords and the melody emphasize the tonic of the leading notes: Fm–E–D–Cm–D–E–Fm–D–E–Fm, resembling a Baroque work. This is followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> dance music, produced by a powerful beat from the instruments. Madonna's vocal range spans from F3 to C5, and has a different sound from her previous work, more mature, centered, and with a lower range.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} to speak English, the children– Ralph says just the surviving girl– {{explained that they}} came from a land where the sun never shone and the light was like twilight. William says the children called their home St Martin's Land; Ralph adds that everything there was green. According to William, the children were unable to account for their arrival in Woolpit; they had been herding their father's cattle when they heard a loud noise (according to William, the bells of Bury St Edmunds) and suddenly found themselves by the wolf pit where they were found. Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and, after being guided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> bells, eventually emerged into our land.|$|E
5|$|Bragg's men {{continued}} northward to Bardstown {{where they}} rested and sought supplies and recruits. Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell's Army of the Ohio, the main Union {{force in the}} state, was pressing toward Louisville. Bragg left his army and met Kirby Smith in Frankfort, where {{he was able to}} attend the inauguration of Confederate Governor Richard Hawes on October 4. Buckner, although protesting this distraction from the military mission, attended as well and gave stirring speeches to the local crowds about the Confederacy's commitment to the state of Kentucky. The inauguration ceremony was disrupted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> cannon fire from an approaching Union division and the inaugural ball scheduled for that evening was canceled.|$|E
60|$|After {{that came}} another period of silence, broken only <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two men undressing. To keep himself awake Dick {{commenced}} {{to walk up}} and down the long hallway again.|$|R

5|$|Five months later, Wendy is on {{a subway}} train with her roommate Laura {{and her friend}} Sean. When she sees more omens she begins to get off, but sees Julie {{entering}} the car and decides to stay. Wendy notices Kevin {{sitting in the back}} of the car. The train derails, and everyone aboard shortly dies; Julie is hit by a stray wheel, and Kevin is crushed between the train and the tunnel wall. Wendy survives the crash, but is hit by another train. This turns out to be another premonition, and they attempt to stop the train. The screen goes black, followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> screeching metal.|$|E
5|$|In 1755, Benedict Arnold was {{attracted}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a drummer {{and attempted to}} enlist in the provincial militia for service against the French, but his mother refused permission. In 1757 when he was sixteen, he did enlist in the Connecticut militia, which marched off toward Albany and Lake George. The French had besieged Fort William Henry in northeastern New York, and their Indian allies had committed atrocities after their victory. Word of the siege's disastrous outcome led the company to turn around; Arnold served for 13 days. A commonly accepted story that Arnold deserted from militia service in 1758 is based on uncertain documentary evidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound of}} Japanese bands Earthshaker, Loudness, Anthem and other minor groups was also {{influenced}} by the NWOBHM, whose British sound engineers were used for their early albums. The Japanese band Bow Wow even transferred to England {{to be part of}} the British metal scene. Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, France and Spain promptly welcomed the new British bands and spawned imitators almost immediately. Acts like Accept, Grave Digger, Sinner and Warlock from Germany, E.F. Band from Sweden, Mercyful Fate from Denmark, Killer and Ostrogoth from Belgium, Picture and Bodine from the Netherlands, Trust and Nightmare from France, and Barón Rojo and Ángeles del Infierno from Spain, formed between 1978 and 1982 and were heavily influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the NWOBHM. Many of these bands signed with the Dutch Roadrunner Records or with the Belgian Mausoleum Records, independent labels that also published recordings of British NWOBHM acts.|$|E
50|$|The music - also {{composed}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> performer - {{is often}} described as being inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> Haiti, however it also makes a nod to <b>the</b> synthesiser <b>sounds</b> increasingly popular at the Contest at the time.|$|R
50|$|New Jersey {{composer}} Frances White {{has written}} two compositions about the bridge: Centre Bridge (1999) and Centre Bridge (dark river)(2001).

5|$|Thétis had {{not even}} cleared the French coast when she was {{discovered}} by a patrolling British frigate of the inshore squadron, a unit tasked with watching {{the entrance to the}} French Biscay ports, principally Brest, and intercepting any ships seeking to enter or leave the harbours. This frigate, HMS Amethyst chased Thétis and brought her to battle, closing with the French ship but preventing the soldiers aboard Thétis from boarding the British ship and using their superior numbers to overwhelm her with heavy and accurate gunfire. The battle lasted more than six hours and the French suffered over 130 men killed, including the captain and many of the soldiers aboard, before the crew of Amethyst was able to storm and capture Thétis. Within minutes two additional British vessels arrived, attracted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> gunfire, and helped secure the badly damaged Thétis for the journey to Britain.|$|E
5|$|When it was re-released in 1947, {{it earned}} an {{impressive}} $5 million rental in the United States and Canada, {{and was one}} of the top ten releases of the year. Successful re-releases in 1954 and 1961 enabled it to retain its position as the industry's top earner, despite strong challenges from more recent films such as Ben-Hur, but it was finally overtaken <b>by</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> Music in 1966. The 1967 reissue was unusual in that MGM opted to roadshow it, a decision that turned it into the most successful re-release in the history of the industry. It generated a box-office gross of $68 million, making it MGM's most lucrative picture after Doctor Zhivago from the latter half of the decade. MGM earned a rental of $41 million from the release, with the U.S. and Canadian share amounting to over $30 million, placing it second only to The Graduate for that year. Including its $6.7 million rental from the 1961 reissue, it was the fourth highest-earner of the decade in the North American market, with only The Sound of Music, The Graduate and Doctor Zhivago making more for their distributors. A further re-release in 1971 allowed it to briefly recapture the record from The Sound of Music, bringing its total worldwide gross rental to about $116 million by the end of 1971—more than trebling its earnings from its initial release—before losing the record again the following year to The Godfather.|$|E
