5|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} {{plays an}} important role in the nitrogen cycle. Azotobacter also synthesizes some biologically active substances, including some phytohormones such as auxins, thereby stimulating plant growth. They also facilitate the mobility of heavy metals in the soil, thus enhancing bioremediation of soil from heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury and lead. Some kinds of Azotobacter can also <b>biodegrade</b> chlorine-containing aromatic compounds, such as 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, which was previously used as an insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide, but later was found to have mutagenic and carcinogenic effects.|$|E

5|$|Cyathus stercoreus {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{for its ability to}} break down lignin and cellulose in agricultural byproducts, like wheat straw or grasses. It selectively breaks down lignin, leaving much of the cellulose intact, which increases the amount of digestible carbohydrate for ruminant mammals, and enhances both its value as a food source and its biodegradability. The enzymes responsible, laccase and manganese peroxidase, also have industrial applications for lignin degradation and removal in the pulp and paper industry. Liquid cultures of C.stercoreus have also been shown to <b>biodegrade</b> the explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).|$|E

In {{the center of the}} Pacific gyre, there is a permanent floating accumulation of mostly plastic waste and there is a similar garbage patch in the Atlantic. Foraging sea birds such as the albatross and petrel may mistake debris for food and accumulate indigestible plastic in their digestive systems. Turtles and whales have been found with plastic bags and fishing line in their stomachs. Microplastics may sink, threatening filter feeders on the seabed.|$|E
5|$|Lignin is {{a complex}} {{polymeric}} chemical compound that is a major constituent of wood. Resistant to biological decomposition, its presence in paper makes it weaker and more liable to discolor when exposed to light. The species C.bulleri contains three lignin-degrading enzymes: lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and laccase. These enzymes have potential applications {{not only in the}} pulp and paper industry, but also to increase the digestibility and protein content of forage for cattle. Because laccases can break down phenolic compounds they may be used to detoxify some environmental pollutants, such as dyes used in the textile industry. C.bulleri laccase has also been genetically engineered to be produced by Escherichia coli, making it the first fungal laccase to be produced in a bacterial host. C.pallidus can <b>biodegrade</b> the explosive compound RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), suggesting it might be used to decontaminate munitions-contaminated soils.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} and economics of production of West African Dwarf (WAD) sheep was investi-gated {{in an experiment}} that lasted for 70 days. Twelve male sheep averaging 9. 9 kg in liveweight and aged 7 - 9 months {{were randomly assigned to}} four treatment groups in a completely rando-mized design with three animals per treatment. Chemical composition of diets, intake, liveweight gain and cost implication of feeding WAD sheep with grass, a conventional concentrate, an autoc-laved and <b>biodegraded</b> Enterolobium cyclocarpum based diet were determined. The crude protein content of Guinea grass (4. 43 %) was relatively low compared to that of <b>biodegraded</b> Enterolobium cyclocarpum (14. 13 %). Total consumption and liveweight change were not significantly different (P < 0. 05). The growth rate of animals fed concentrates were significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than those on the grass diet. Cost per Kg of feed was the highest for control and least for guinea grass diet. However, cost per unit gain was the highest for Guinea grass diet (N 176. 73) and least for <b>biodegraded</b> Enterolobium cyclocarpum diet (N 72. 62).

25|$|Eighty {{percent of}} marine debris is plastic. Plastics {{accumulate}} because they typically do not <b>biodegrade</b> {{as many other}} substances do. They photodegrade on exposure to sunlight, although they do so only under dry conditions, as water inhibits photolysis. In a 2014 study using computers models, scientists from the group 5 Gyres, estimate 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic weighing 269,000 tons dispersed in oceans in similar amount in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and one-hundredth of them in particles in the scale of a sand-size.|$|E

Oil sands are reservoirs of partially biodegraded oil {{still in the}} process of escaping and being biodegraded, but they contain so much migrating oil that, although most of it has escaped, vast amounts are still present—more than can be found in conventional oil reservoirs. The lighter fractions of the crude oil are destroyed first, resulting in reservoirs containing an extremely heavy form of crude oil, called crude bitumen in Canada, or extra-heavy crude oil in Venezuela. These two countries have the world's largest deposits of oil sands.|$|E
25|$|Plastics {{accumulate}} {{because they}} don't <b>biodegrade</b> {{in the way}} many other substances do. They will photodegrade on exposure to the sun, but they do so properly only under dry conditions, and water inhibits this process. In marine environments, photodegraded plastic disintegrates into ever-smaller pieces while remaining polymers, even down to the molecular level. When floating plastic particles photodegrade down to zooplankton sizes, jellyfish attempt to consume them, {{and in this way}} the plastic enters the ocean food chain. Many of these long-lasting pieces end up in the stomachs of marine birds and animals, including sea turtles, and black-footed albatross.|$|E

40|$|Comprehensive {{two-dimensional}} {{gas chromatography}} with {{time of flight}} mass spectrometry (GC×GC-TOFMS) is an appropriate technique for the elucidation of molecular composition of petrochemical samples, such as <b>biodegraded</b> oils.

In the extracted ion chromatogram m/z 123 + 177 + 191, coelutions between tricyclic terpanes, hopanes and 25 -nor-hopanes with secohopanes were resolved by GC×GC-TOFMS. GC×GC-TOFMS allowed the identification of complete series of 25 -nor-hopanes, nor-gammacerane, C 29 28 -nor-spergulanes and oleanane not identified by using GC-MS. The biomarker ratios from the studied oils indicated that they derived from marine source rock deposited under anoxic conditions. The higher chromatographic resolution and sensitivity achieved by using GC×GC-TOFMS allowed for three new parameters to characterize <b>biodegraded</b> oils.

40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that single-walled carbon nanotubes can be catalytically <b>biodegraded</b> over several weeks by the plant-derived enzyme, horseradish peroxidase 1. However, whether peroxidase intermediates generated inside human cells or biofluids {{are involved in}} the biodegradation of carbon nanotubes has not been explored. Here, we show that hypochlorite and reactive radical intermediates of the human neutrophil enzyme myeloperoxidase catalyse the biodegradation of single-walled carbon nanotubes in vitro, in neutrophils and to a lesser degree in macrophages. Molecular modelling suggests that interactions of basic amino acids of the enzyme with the carboxyls on the carbon nanotubes position the nanotubes near the catalytic site. Importantly, the <b>biodegraded</b> nanotubes do not generate an inflammatory response when aspirated into the lungs of mice. Our findings suggest that the extent to which carbon nanotubes are <b>biodegraded</b> may be a major determinant of the scale and severity of the associated inflammatory responses in exposed individuals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Four isonitrogeneous diet {{made up of}} Brewer’s dried grain with {{a control}} diet was {{distributed}} {{at the rate of}} 9 birds per replicate and three replicates per diet in a completely randomized design experiment. Fungal biodegradation of brewers dried grain (BDG) resulted in improved nutrient composition of the by-product. The effects of feeding <b>biodegraded</b> BDG on relative organ weight, serum and heamatological parameters and economy of broiler finisher were investigated. Although no significant difference was observed in the feed intake of broiler finisher fed the graded levels tested but significant difference (P< 0. 05) was observed in the rate of weight gain (g/day). Feed cost per kilogram was lowest on diet 4 but feed cost per weight gain (N/g) gave a value of 10. 60 and 7. 32 on diet 4 and 2 respectively. <b>Biodegraded</b> BDG at 20 % inclusion level gave the highest weight gain 1213. 73 over 28 days and the lowest weight gain of 668. 51 g on diet 4. Weight of gizzard and liver significantly increased with inclusion of BDG a weight range of 2. 50 to 3. 30 % and 1. 59 - 2. 59 % respectively of the total weight.
