5|$|For the <b>breakout,</b> the Marines {{formed into}} a convoy {{with a single}} M4A3 Sherman tank as the lead. The plan was to have 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5) as {{the vanguard of the}} convoy, with three battalions {{covering}} the rear. At the same time, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines (1/7) would attack towards Fox Company in order to open the road at Toktong Pass. To start the <b>breakout,</b> 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines (3/7) had to first attack south and capture Hill 1542 and Hill 1419 in order to cover the road from Chinese attacks. The <b>breakout</b> was carried out under the air cover of the 1st Marine Air Wing.|$|E

5|$|Of all the {{responsibilities}} given the two ships, {{the most important}} was to guard the Eastern Mediterranean against a <b>breakout</b> by Goeben, but when Goeben and Breslau finally made their <b>breakout</b> attempt on 20 January 1918, Lord Nelson was away at Salonika and Agamemnon could not get steam up to depart Mudros in time {{to participate in the}} resulting Battle of Imbros. After both German ships struck mines, Breslau sank and Goeben returned to the Dardanelles before Agamemnon could arrive on the scene.|$|E
5|$|On {{the week}} ending August 8, 2008, <b>Breakout</b> debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200, thus earning Cyrus a third number-one album {{on the chart}} – {{including}} albums fully credited to Hannah Montana; the album sold 371,000 copies in its debut week, becoming the fourth-highest sales week of 2008 for a female artist. The following week, <b>Breakout</b> descended to number two, selling 163,000 copies. The album spent a total of forty-eight weeks on the Billboard 200. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments exceeding one million copies. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album has sold 1.5 million copies since its release. Due to sales of 27,000 copies, <b>Breakout</b> entered at number-one on the Canadian Albums Chart on the week ending August 8, 2008, maintaining the top spot for two consecutive weeks.|$|E

5|$|According to naval {{historian}} Ian Buxton, {{the most}} important role of the Royal Navy was to blockade the Dardanelles and thus guard the Eastern Mediterranean against a <b>breakout</b> by Goeben. On 12 January 1918, Rear-Admiral Arthur Hayes-Sadler hoisted his flag aboard Lord Nelson at Mudros as the new commander of the Aegean Squadron. Needing transportation to Salonika for a conference with the British Army commander there, and finding his personal yacht unavailable, Hayes-Sadler opted to have Lord Nelson take him there, and thus she was not present when Goeben and Breslau finally made their <b>breakout</b> attempt on 20 January. The ship could not {{get back to the}} Dardanelles in time to participate in the resulting Battle of Imbros or intercept Goeben before she gained shelter in the Dardanelles. Lord Nelson was later given a short refit at Malta in October.|$|E

30|$|The SH {{orientation}} is approximately north-south, and the vertical stress SV {{is equivalent to}} the overburden. However, in inhomogeneous rock masses with changing mechanical properties, the magnitude and orientation of the stress field change at the transition between layers of different mechanical strength. The Soultz granite is very heterogeneous due to its porphyritic structure, its lithological variations, hydrothermally altered zones, and the profound fracturing. Borehole <b>breakouts</b> generally form {{in the direction of the}} minimum horizontal stress and are therefore useful indicators of the orientation of Sh and SH. An analysis of borehole <b>breakouts</b> can give evidence about local stress variations. The high resolution of the SCCLs in the order of decimeters for the first time allows a detailed analysis of the indications for stress field variations at Soultz on the basis of <b>breakouts.</b> In the following section, the occurrence of <b>breakouts</b> and their {{orientation is}} interpreted on the basis of the SCCLs.|$|R

5|$|After a {{short period}} of rest, the <b>breakout</b> began on 6 December with the 7th Marines as the vanguard of the {{retreating}} column while the 5th Marines covered the rear. At the same time, the much-delayed PVA 26th Corps arrived at Hagaru-ri with its 76th and 77th Division relieving the 58th and 60th Divisions. As the 7th Marines pushed aside the PVA 76th Division south of Hagaru-ri, the 5th Marines took over the Hagaru-ri perimeter and recaptured the East Hill from the 76th Division. In a last effort to stop the <b>breakout,</b> the customary Chinese night attack returned with the 76th and 77th Division striking the Hagaru-ri perimeter from all directions. The Marines repulsed the Chinese attacks, inflicting heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|At 1:00a.m. on February 14, Floyd held {{a council}} {{of war in}} his {{headquarters}} at the Dover Hotel. There was general agreement that Fort Donelson was probably untenable. General Pillow was designated to lead a <b>breakout</b> attempt, evacuate the fort, and march to Nashville. Troops were moved behind the lines and the assault readied, {{but at the last}} minute a Union sharpshooter killed one of Pillow's aides. Pillow, normally quite aggressive in battle, was unnerved and announced that since their movement had been detected, the <b>breakout</b> had to be postponed. Floyd was furious at this change of plans, but by then it was too late in the day to proceed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Breakout</b> is {{the second}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Miley Cyrus, released on July 22, 2008 by Hollywood Records. It is her first record that is not affiliated with the television series Hannah Montana, in which Cyrus portrays the title character Hannah Montana. She co-wrote eight of its thirteen tracks, several of which {{with the assistance of}} Antonina Armato and Tim James. The majority of the record was composed as she traveled during her headlining Best of Both Worlds Tour (200708). Overall, <b>Breakout</b> is dominant on pop rock but explores a variety of other musical genres. Lyrical themes addressed in the album relate to breakups and coming of age.|$|E

30|$|Borehole <b>breakouts</b> are enlargements and {{elongation}} of a borehole in {{a particular}} direction, caused by failure of the borehole wall rock due to concentration of stresses around the borehole, and thus, {{have been widely used}} to determine the in situ stress orientation. We used electrical borehole wall images obtained during offshore scientific drilling (IODP) that penetrated through a seismogenic megasplay fault in the Nankai Trough, off SW Japan, and extracted a number of borehole <b>breakouts.</b> Most of the <b>breakouts</b> show directions that {{can be explained by the}} regional convergence, but some are obviously rotated by faults and fractures in the megasplay fault zone and in its hanging wall. Stress magnitudes estimated from the width of the <b>breakouts</b> also show some decrease in the horizontal stresses, suggesting that slip along the faults and fractures release shear stress affecting these surfaces. Since such surfaces may have the capability to reactivate where the stresses affecting the surface are geometrically appropriate, the method presented in this paper may contribute to identifying active fault surfaces. This knowledge allows us to identify which surfaces need to be examined in detail to assess their potential for future activity.|$|R

40|$|At Sites U 1322 and U 1324 {{borehole}} <b>breakouts</b> are {{a conspicuous}} {{feature of the}} LWD resistivity images. The <b>breakouts</b> occur as cylindrically opposed zones of low resistivity, but also as zones of high resistivity flanked by narrower low resistivity intervals. The <b>breakouts</b> show a consistent E-W trend at each borehole and with depth in the boreholes. Specifically the Shmin directions are 84 - 264 o and 89 - 269 o, respectively, at Sites U 1322 and U 1324. In the extensional state of stress of the Mars/Ursa area, Shmin is the minimum principal stress. Shmin at U 1324 is subparallel to the southeast slope of the Mars ridge of the 7 / 01 / 08 2 Mississippi fan.

40|$|Two of {{the major}} {{problems}} in continuous casting are cracks and <b>breakouts.</b> Usually primary cracks are associated with <b>breakouts</b> and can also develop into more pronounced cracking in the secondary cooling zone. This paper aims at designing a fuzzy control system to control the dynamism associated with the continuous casting process in order to eliminate cracks and <b>breakouts.</b> The fuzzy control system, (which is a multi-input, multi-output system), obtains inputs of temperature related values from the thermocouples attached to the mould wall. The major outputs of the controller are casting speed and cooling rate and these are controlled {{with the aid of}} variable speed drives. The fuzzy controller attempts to eliminate primary and secondary cracks that could be linked to high casting temperatures by varying the secondary cooling rates.
