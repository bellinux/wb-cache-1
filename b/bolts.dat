5|$|Atherton, {{along with}} {{neighbouring}} Shakerley, {{was associated with}} coal mining and nail manufacture. Alexander Naylor was taxed on his goods in 1332, showing the industry was present for at least 600years. Encouraged by the proximity of outcrops of coal, iron was brought from Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Spain. A variety of nails were made, lath nails, slate nails, thatching nails and sparrowbills. The nail smithies manufactured ploughs and scythes; their products were taken by pack horse to be sold in Manchester, Denbigh, Clitheroe and Kendal. The nail industry developed into the manufacture of nuts and <b>bolts.</b> Thomas Blakemore {{was the first in}} 1843 and by 1853 there were eight makers of nuts and <b>bolts</b> including James Prestwich and Robert Parker. Some manufacturers of nuts and <b>bolts</b> made spindles and flyers for spinning machinery. Collier Brook Bolt Works on Bag Lane dating from 1856 survives and is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} brief nature of the Spanish {{occupation}} of the city, very few European artefacts were found. Those few pieces that were found consisted of forged iron crossbow <b>bolts.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract The <b>bolt</b> {{load loss}} {{behavior}} of AZ 91 D magnesium alloy <b>bolted</b> joints with a conventional SCM 435 steel <b>bolt</b> and an A 5056 aluminum <b>bolt</b> was investigated at elevated temperature. The A 5056 <b>bolt</b> {{could reduce the}} <b>bolt</b> load loss compared to the SCM 435 <b>bolt</b> due to smaller mismatch of thermal expansion between the <b>bolt</b> material and the plates. The mismatch of thermal expansion between <b>bolt</b> material and AZ 91 D plates was found to induce the compressive creep deformation in the AZ 91 D plates which performed as the main mechanism of <b>bolt</b> load loss. At higher tightening stress, the <b>bolt</b> load loss could be intensified by additional plastic deformation in <b>bolt</b> occurred during the test. Moreover, {{it is suggested that}} the plastic deformation could be reduced by decreasing the friction condition in the <b>bolted</b> joint...|$|R

5|$|The early Y-1222 model Fat Man was {{assembled}} {{with some}} 1,500 <b>bolts.</b> This was superseded by the Y-1291 design in December 1944. This redesign work was substantial, {{and only the}} Y-1222 tail design was retained. Later versions included the Y-1560, which had 72 detonators; the Y-1561, which had 32; and the Y-1562, which had 132. There were also the Y-1563 and Y-1564, which were practice bombs with no detonators at all. The final wartime Y-1561 design was assembled with just 90 <b>bolts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Block II {{had already}} been planned to use a {{completely}} redesigned hatch which opened outward, and could be opened {{in less than five}} seconds. Concerns of accidental opening were addressed by using a cartridge of pressurized nitrogen to drive the release mechanism in an emergency, instead of the explosive <b>bolts</b> used on Project Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{changing}} load as the wheel rotates in alternating directions, some sections experience total stress reversals. In order to avoid fatigue {{that could lead to}} cracks, sections were bolted rather than welded, using over 14,000 <b>bolts</b> and 45,000 bolt holes.|$|E
50|$|A {{carriage}} <b>bolt,</b> coach <b>bolt</b> or {{round head}} square neck <b>bolt</b> {{is a form}} of <b>bolt</b> used to fasten metal to wood.|$|R
25|$|At this point, the <b>bolt</b> {{is locked}} into the barrel {{extension}} by locking lugs, so the expanding gas forces the <b>bolt</b> carrier backward a short distance. As the <b>bolt</b> carrier {{moves toward the}} butt of the gun, the <b>bolt</b> cam pin, riding in a slot on the <b>bolt</b> carrier, forces the <b>bolt</b> to rotate and thus unlocks it from the barrel extension. Once the <b>bolt</b> is fully unlocked it begins its rearward movement along with the <b>bolt</b> carrier. The <b>bolt's</b> rearward motion extracts the empty cartridge case from the chamber. As soon as the neck of the case clears the barrel extension, the <b>bolt's</b> spring-loaded ejector forces it out the ejection port {{in the side of the}} upper receiver.|$|R
50|$|The G3A3 (A4) is a selective-fire {{automatic}} weapon that employs a roller-delayed blowback operating system. The two-piece <b>bolt</b> assembly {{consists of a}} breech (<b>bolt</b> head) and <b>bolt</b> carrier. The <b>bolt</b> is held in battery by two sliding cylindrical rollers that engage locking recesses in the barrel extension. The breech is opened when both rollers are compressed inward against camming surfaces driven by the rearward pressure of the expanding gases upon the <b>bolt</b> head. As the rollers move inward, recoil energy is transferred to the locking piece and <b>bolt</b> carrier which begin to withdraw while the <b>bolt</b> head slowly moves rearward {{in relation to the}} <b>bolt</b> carrier. As the <b>bolt</b> carrier clears the rollers, pressure in the bore drops to a safe level, the <b>bolt</b> head is caught by the <b>bolt</b> carrier and moves to the rear as one unit, continuing the operating cycle. The <b>bolt</b> also features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the <b>bolt</b> from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface. The spring-powered claw extractor is also contained inside the <b>bolt</b> while the lever ejector is located inside the trigger housing (actuated by the recoiling <b>bolt).</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{a letter}} to the editor in Aftenposten on 17 June, {{submitted}} by Robert M. Steen, it was suggested that reaching the ledge would be a suitable challenge for the mountaineering association Norsk Tindeklub. The newspaper contacted the club, and offered to cover all expenses. The club sent Boye Schlytter and Henning Tønsberg to Bergen, where they joined forces with police officer Hermann Heggenes and photographer and firefighter Alf Adriansen. The expedition was led by Balchen, arriving with the BSD vessel Vulcanus. Arne Næss, Jr. had just used <b>bolts</b> to climb the Dolomites, and these had been lent to Tønsberg. As such, it was the first time <b>bolts</b> were used for climbing in Norway.|$|E
5|$|King Louis XV honored Franklin {{after seeing}} {{some of the}} {{electrical}} experiments done in the royal palace at St. Germain near Paris, France. However physicist Jean-Antoine Nollet (1700–1770), a skeptic who had published his own theory on electricity, declared Franklin's ideas were wrong. He claimed in 1753 that Franklin's lightning rod was not only dangerous but useless and would attract lightning <b>bolts</b> to wooden buildings, causing them to be hit more often. Franklin in time proved to the scientific community that his lightning rod invention not only was a protective device, but it {{also served as a}} preventive way to divert destructive lightning <b>bolts</b> away from hitting buildings.|$|E
40|$|Thin wire {{welded to}} bottom of hole down center of <b>bolt</b> permits {{measurement}} of tension in <b>bolt.</b> <b>Bolt</b> lengthens under strain, but wire is not loaded, so gap between wire and eddy-current gap transducer mounted on <b>bolt</b> head indicates <b>bolt</b> loading. Eddy-current transducer could measure gap within 0. 05 mm. Method {{does not require}} separate "standard" for each <b>bolt</b> type, and is not sensitive to dirt or oil in <b>bolt</b> hole, unlike ultrasonic probes...|$|R

5|$|The prototypes {{performed}} well; however, several design failings led to {{the loss}} of WB771 on 14 July 1954, when the tailplane detached whilst making a low-level pass over the runway at Cranfield, causing the aircraft to crash with the loss of the crew. Attached to the fin using three <b>bolts,</b> the tailplane was subject to considerably more stress than had been anticipated, and the three <b>bolts</b> failed due to metal fatigue. Additionally, the prototypes were considerably tail heavy {{due to the lack of}} equipment in the nose; this was remedied by large ballast weights being fitted upon the prototypes. Production Victors had a lengthened nose that also served to move the crew escape door further from the engine intakes. The fin was shortened to eliminate the potential for flutter while the tailplane attachment was changed to a stronger four-bolt fixing.|$|E

A person from Xizhou, a Tokharistani (i.e. Bactrian), and three Sogdians verified the sale of the girl.|$|E
50|$|CMMG {{introduced}} the Mk 45 Guard rifle incorporating a radial-delay in 2017. This system uses {{the rotation of}} the <b>bolt</b> head to accelerate the <b>bolt</b> carrier of an AR-15 pattern rifle. The <b>bolt</b> locking lugs are adapted to incorporate angles that rotate the <b>bolt</b> as it travels rearward under conventional blowback power. As the <b>bolt</b> rotates, it must accelerate the <b>bolt</b> carrier to the rear through an adapted cam-pin slot. This acceleration amplifies the effective mass of the <b>bolt</b> carrier, slowing the speed of the <b>bolt</b> head. This delay allows pressure to drop prior to extraction without the penalty of a heavier <b>bolt</b> carrier assembly. The system is similar to roller and lever-delayed blowback in that it uses the mass of the <b>bolt</b> carrier moving at a faster rate than the <b>bolt</b> head to delay the action from opening.|$|R
50|$|While {{it would}} be simpler and easier to shorten the <b>bolt</b> to fit {{completely}} behind the breech, the <b>bolt</b> must have {{a certain amount of}} mass in order to operate reliably with a given caliber. The telescoping <b>bolt</b> moves some of that mass forward of the <b>bolt</b> face, resulting in a <b>bolt</b> which is longer overall, but is shorter behind the <b>bolt</b> face.|$|R

25|$|The Timberwolf {{action is}} a {{manually}} operated stainless steel <b>bolt</b> action with a right-hand side <b>bolt</b> and ejection port. The <b>bolt</b> is a rotary <b>bolt</b> with dual front locking lugs plus one locking lug at the rear. It requires a 90-degree <b>bolt</b> rotation. the <b>bolt</b> is partly helically fluted which reduces weight and stops <b>bolt</b> debris jams. A double plunger ejector and hook type extractor are used to remove fired cartridge cases. This helps create a very smooth action which is very reliable. The extra locking lug at the rear assists in preventing the <b>bolt</b> from becoming jammed when chambering another round.|$|R

40|$|Rock <b>bolting</b> has firmly used as {{the coal}} mine roof {{reinforcement}} in underground coal mine. The <b>bolting</b> effect of fully grouted rebar <b>bolt</b> {{is closely related to}} the <b>bolt</b> surface profile. This paper provides an experimental study to confirm that <b>bolt</b> rib internal length has great influence on <b>bolting</b> effect. Pull-out tests were conducted using rebar <b>bolt</b> with different rib spacings of 12, 24, 36 and 48. mm representatively from steel tube and from concrete. Results show that peak load increases 25. 3 % for <b>bolt</b> with large rib spacing. For pull out using concrete block, the increment of peak load between large and small rib spacing is not significant, but the <b>bolt</b> with large rib spacing has great absorption of deformational energy than small rib spacing <b>bolt.</b> This study provides experimental evidence towards optimum design of rock <b>bolt</b> for understand coal mining industry...|$|R
5|$|Chromium, use of: The use of {{chromium}} {{was invented}} in China no later than 210 BC when the Terracotta Army was interred at a site not far from modern Xi'an; modern archaeologists discovered that bronze-tipped crossbow <b>bolts</b> at the site {{showed no sign of}} corrosion after more than 2,000 years, because they had been coated in chromium. Chromium was not used anywhere else until the experiments of French pharmacist and chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin (1763–1829) in the late 1790s.|$|E

5000|$|In Spool-valve-based {{electropneumatic}} markers, the <b>bolt</b> also {{acts as the}} valve. This {{eliminates the}} need for a stacked tube construction; spool valve markers have a more compact profile. Instead of a cycling hammer or ram that strikes a pin valve, the movement of the <b>bolt</b> is controlled by the routing of air into small chambers in front of or behind the <b>bolt.</b> An air reservoir behind the <b>bolt</b> contains the air that is to fire the paintball. When the marker is at rest, air is routed {{to the front of the}} <b>bolt</b> to prevent the air in the reservoir from escaping. In an [...] "unbalanced spool valve" [...] design, when the trigger is pulled, that air is exhausted from the marker, allowing the air in the reservoir to push the <b>bolt</b> forwards. In a [...] "balanced spool valve" [...] design, the air in the reservoir cannot force the <b>bolt</b> open; instead, the air from the front of the <b>bolt</b> is rerouted to a small chamber behind the <b>bolt,</b> separate from the reservoir, which then pushes the <b>bolt</b> forward. In either case, the movement of the <b>bolt</b> forward exposes pathways in the <b>bolt</b> or the marker that allow the air in the reservoir behind the <b>bolt</b> to surge forward and fire the paintball. Afterwards, airflow to the front of the <b>bolt</b> is restored, pushing the <b>bolt</b> back into its resting position.|$|R
