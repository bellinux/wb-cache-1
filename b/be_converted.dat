5|$|A {{regeneration}} {{scheme was}} announced in 2004; supported by the Phoenix Trust, the maltings would <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> into residential, retail and business space. Public consultation took place in 2005 and 2006, with around 90% of participants supporting regeneration and three-quarters asking for a cinema and entertainment complex. Lincolnshire Enterprise granted £200,000 towards the regeneration scheme and the Gladedale Group came forward to develop the project. Over the next three years, they worked with the Prince's Regeneration Trust to draw up plans for the site's regeneration which protected the historic exterior. In 2009, their proposals were submitted for planning permission. North Kesteven District Council approved the £50million development in 2011; Tesco was also granted permission to build a £20million supermarket {{as part of the}} redevelopment. The maltings would <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> into retail and office space, alongside 220 apartments.|$|E

50|$|GAs {{are usually}} {{produced}} from the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in higher plants. In this pathway, bioactive GA is produced from trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP). In the MEP pathway, three classes of enzymes {{are used to}} yield GA from GGDP: 1) terpene synthases (TPSs), 2) cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), and 3) 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2ODDs). There are 8 steps in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway: - 1) GGDP <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CPD) by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase - 2) etn-CDP <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-kaurene by ent-kaurene synthase - 3) ent-kaurene <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-kaurenol by ent-kaurene oxidase (KO) - 4) ent-kaurenol <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-kaurenal by KO - 5) ent-kaurenal <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-kaurenoic acid by KO - 6) ent-kaurenoic acid <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid by ent-kaurene acid oxidase (KAO) - 7) ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to GA12-aldehyde by KAO- 8) GA12-aldehyde <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to GA12 by KAO. GA12 is processed to the bioactive GA4 by oxidations on C-20 and C-3, which is accomplished by 2 soluble ODDs: GA 20-oxidase and GA 3-oxidase.|$|R
