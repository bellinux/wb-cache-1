There, <b>Bowser</b> Jr. revives his father's skeleton, creating Dry <b>Bowser,</b> but Mario once again defeats <b>Bowser</b> by dropping him into a deep pit. In the final battle, <b>Bowser</b> Jr. flees once more across a lava chasm to a larger castle, where he throws his father's bones into a cauldron and revives <b>Bowser</b> in his original form.
