500|$|The {{following}} year, Widdoes asked Horvath {{to return}} to the team, taking advantage of a wartime rule that allowed college programs to use graduate students if they had not exhausted their four years of college eligibility. Widdoes promised Horvath a leading role as the team's left halfback, a level of prominence he had been denied under Brown. Horvath agreed to come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> a veteran leader for a team that was composed mostly of freshmen because of older players' service in the war. Horvath had a breakout season in 1944, gaining 669 rushing yards and 1,200 all-purpose yards as the Buckeyes turned in a 9–0 record and finished second in the national polls. The highlights of Horvath's season included scoring the winning touchdown in Ohio State's annual matchup against Michigan. Calling all of Ohio State's offensive plays, he was nicknamed the [...] "playing coach".|$|E
500|$|Before the 1994 season, the Elias Sports Bureau {{informed}} the Orioles that Ripken had surpassed Ernie Banks for most career home runs as a shortstop with his 278th on July 15 against Scott Erickson. Banks met Ripken {{at a ceremony}} on February 9 and said, [...] "I'm extremely happy that he broke this record because it {{give me a chance}} to come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> remembered too." [...] Ripken started the season strong, batting [...]340 with 19 RBI through April. On May 24, Ripken had six RBI, including his 300th home run against Teddy Higuera, as the Orioles rallied from a 5–0 deficit to defeat the Brewers 13–5. On August 1, he played in his 2,000th consecutive game, a 1–0 victory over the Twins at the Metrodome. Through 112 games, Ripken batted [...]315 with 13 home runs and 75 RBI before the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike cancelled the rest of the season.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduces}} two new {{characters to}} the series, portrayed by Aaron Munoz (Tony) and Michael Raymond-James (Dave). Although {{they were killed}} off in the episode, writer Robert Kirkman wanted to evoke a reaction that the characters would recur throughout the series. [...] "With the casting of those two guys and everything involving that scene we were really {{trying to convince the}} audience {{that they were going to}} be new regulars, so the end would be that much more shocking." [...] Kirkman felt that Tony and Dave represent new threats and anxieties for the group. [...] "I think this was a particularly good episode coming back because the two guys in the bar represent new threats and they are really just the tip of the iceberg," [...] he stated. [...] "It's really good to come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> off of the farm and see that there are more dangerous things out there than the zombies. Things just keep getting worse from here.". [...] "The Regulator" [...] by Clutch was the song used as the closing title sequence.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{think they}} always had me in mind for Nova. But they needed someone to do the screen test, and you keep trying to employ your actors. So. I did the screen test. The part that {{was hard for me}} was {{actually}} doing the mask,where they put all that plaster on your face and you have to lie there still for a long time. Fortunately, I was an acrobat growing up, and a very very good one — I won a lot of contests — so I knew how to control my body and be 'quiet.' You had to do that, you had to be very still and lay there and be a 'good patient.' A young actor will do anything to get their mug on the screen! I remember that the makeup process took about three hours. I had to lay <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> perfectly still as they put this plaster mold on my face. After seeing the test, everyone was very enthusiastic about going ahead with making Planet of the Apes. But they felt the makeup needed a little more work and perfecting before it would look good on screen." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{quote from}} the NMC, {{describes}} the ideal mouse body type, for showing: [...] "The mouse must be long on body with long clean head, not too fine or pointed at the nose, the eyes should be large, bold and prominent. The ears large and tulip shaped, free from creases, carried erect with plenty of width between them. The body should be long and slim, a trifle arched over the loin and racy in appearance; the tail, which must be free from kinks should come well out of the <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> thick at the root or set-on, gradually tapering like a whip lash to a fine end, the length being about {{equal to that of}} the mouse's body. Unless the variety standard states otherwise, the coat should be short perfectly smooth, glossy and sleek to the hand. The mouse should be perfectly tractable and free from any vice and not subject to fits or other similar ailments. A mouse with absence of whiskers, blind in one or both eyes, carrying external parasites, having a tumor, sore or legs with fur missing, suffering from any obvious disease or deformity or kinked tail shall be disqualified." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{look was}} created by Doctor Who costume {{designer}} Howard Burden who wanted to strip the Doctor back to the bare basics. His design was described as [...] "No frills, no scarfs, no messing, just 100% rebel Time Lord." [...] Capaldi said that the costume {{took a long time}} to find. The reason he settled on his final costume was because, [...] "I think it's quite a hard look. I always wanted him to be in black – I always just saw the Doctor in dark colours. Not tweed," [...] in reference to his immediate predecessor's original costume. [...] "Matt's a really young cool guy – he can wear anything, but I wanted to strip it <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> very stark." [...] He also described it as [...] "back to basics." [...] Moffat described the look as [...] "A stick-insect sort of thing". He also said that Clara calls him [...] "a grey-haired stick-insect at one point". Capaldi also stated that he chose the Twelfth Doctor's costume so fans of the show who enjoy cosplay could easily emulate it without going to great expense. Writing for Radio Times, fashion columnist Anna Fielding described it as [...] "a classic early skinhead look" [...] and linked it to Capaldi's history as a punk musician.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934 {{the chief}} of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Admiral Ernest King, offered Halsey command of the {{aircraft}} carrier , subject to completion of the course of an air observer. Captain Halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full 12-week Naval Aviator course rather than the simpler Naval Aviation Observer program. [...] "I thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> {{at the mercy of the}} pilot." [...] Halsey earned his Naval Aviator's Wings on May 15, 1935, at the age of 52, the oldest person to do so in the history of the U.S. Navy. While he had approval from his wife to train as an observer, she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training, and she told her daughter, [...] "What do you think that the old fool is doing now? He's learning to fly!" [...] He went on to command the Saratoga, and later the Naval Air Station Pensacola at Pensacola, Florida. Halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy, commenting, [...] "The naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation, and good." [...] Captain Halsey was promoted to rear admiral in 1938. During this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the Aircraft Battle Force.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1800, McGready {{was joined}} at Red River by several area Presbyterian ministers, {{including}} William Hodge, John Rankin (whom McGready had recently appointed the minister for the Gasper River congregation), and the brothers, William and John McGee, the latter a Methodist minister who, some years later, wrote his {{account for the}} Methodist Missionary Magazine. [...] His narrative painted a vivid picture of the revival’s beginnings: [...] “All was silent until Monday, {{the last day of}} the feast. … [...] While Mr. Hodge was preaching, a woman in the East end got an uncommon blessing, broke through order, and shouted for some time and then sat down in silence." [...] McGee continued, relating that most of the ministers were already gathered outside the meeting house while the people remained seated inside, unwilling to leave, when his brother, William, “felt such a power come on him that he quit his seat and sat down in the floor of the pulpit." [...] John McGee began to tremble as weeping erupted through the congregation. [...] The woman in the east end began to shout again and McGee started toward her just as someone reminded him that his Presbyterian hosts were “much for order” and would not “hear this confusion; go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> quiet." [...] McGee turned to go back and was “near falling” when he changed his mind and “went through the house shouting and exhorting with all possible ecstasy and energy." [...] Using the term that came to be associated with the revival phenomenon of collapsing in a state of physical helplessness, McGee continued: [...] “The floor was soon covered with the slain; their screams for mercy pierced the heavens.” ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} in 2007, after finishing with his rehabilitation, Morgan explained how the song had [...] "haunted" [...] him around and badly affected his reputation. He stated {{that it was not}} pleasant to hear a song describing him as a [...] "bad guy" [...] which [...] "millions of people have heard". He elaborated, [...] "I was bummed out. I was really upset that she would say and do those things. In any relationship, I don't think it's right to say and do those things when people break up, and she obviously felt the need {{to go out there and}} make me sound like a complete a--hole ... I just refuse to lower myself to that level. But it was a painful thing and it got me down." [...] At the time of the interview, Seether's album Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces was to be released soon and speculations started arising to whether it would contain an answer song to [...] "Call Me When You're Sober"; [...] "Breakdown" [...] was initially pinpointed as a possible answer. In response to that, Morgan elaborated that the particular song was not an [...] "angry backlash" [...] and it was [...] "more universal" [...] as he was trying to be [...] "more vague and respectful". Talking about Lee's song, he mentioned how [...] "there are always two sides to every story", yet, he opted not to tell his side as [...] "hat's what the bloodthirsty want, and I don't care what the bloodthirsty want" [...] emphasizing that he [...] "didn't feel the need to write <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> mean". He added that Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces did not contain other answer songs aimed at Lee either, as [...] "I know what the expectations are for this album and that people will be looking for that Amy Lee reference, and I am trying desperately not to have any" [...] further noting how any possible references would be about another relationship he had recently terminated or inspired by other people in his life. Lee expressed [...] "no intention of hurting [...] " [...] during {{an interview}}, but noted that once the song came out without any metaphors, she wanted to keep it.|$|E
