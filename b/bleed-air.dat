50|$|The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is {{an example}} of a {{commercial}} airframe to use electro-thermal ice protection. In this case the resistive heating circuit is embedded inside the glass and carbon composite wing structure. Boeing claims the system uses half the energy of traditional <b>bleed-air</b> systems (as provided by the engines), and that drag and noise are also reduced.|$|E
50|$|To {{achieve the}} desired temperature, the <b>bleed-air</b> is passed through a heat {{exchanger}} called a pre-cooler. Air bled from the engine fan is blown across the pre-cooler, located in the engine strut, and absorbes excess heat from the service bleed air. A fan air modulating valve (FAMV) varies the cooling airflow to control the final air temperature of the service bleed air.|$|E
50|$|With a {{conventional}} layout that somewhat resembled a scaled-up Lockheed F-104, the XB-68 {{was to have}} been primarily of steel construction, with the crew of a pilot-radio operator and navigator-bombardier defense systems operator in a pressurized compartment, to be cooled by filtered <b>bleed-air</b> from the engines, and a refrigeration unit for evaporative cooling at high Mach numbers. The B-68 would have had stubby diamond-shaped wings and a raked T-tail empennage. It was intended to be operated at supersonic speeds at medium and high altitudes.|$|E
5000|$|On August 2, 2012, a U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18D {{fighter jet}} {{en route from}} MCAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan made an {{emergency}} landing on Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge due to a <b>bleed-air</b> leak in its environmental control system (ECS). A second F/A-18D landed shortly after them as a precaution, while their escort of 2 other F/A-18D fighter jets and a U.S. Air Force KC-10A refueling aircraft continued on to Wake Island Airfield. A Marine Corps KC-130 Hercules turboprop transport was later dispatched to Midway with a maintenance crew and parts for repairs.|$|E
5000|$|Air {{from the}} [...] "mix manifold" [...] is {{directed}} to overhead distribution nozzles [...] in the various [...] "zones" [...] of the aircraft. Temperature in each zone may be adjusted by adding small amounts of [...] "trim air", which is low-pressure, high-temperature air tapped off the aircraft pack upstream of the TCV. Air is also supplied to individual gaspers: small, circular vents above each passenger seat that can be adjusted by passengers for their personal comfort. A revolving control on the vent can be turned to adjust ventilation between no air output at all and a fairly substantial breeze.Gaspers usually receive their air from the air conditioning packs aboard the aircraft, which in turn receive compressed, clean air from the compressor stages of the aircraft's jet engines or when on the ground from the auxiliary power unit (APU) or a ground source. A master control for gaspers {{is located in the}} cockpit, and gaspers may be temporarily turned off during certain phases of flight, when the load on the engines from <b>bleed-air</b> demands must be minimized (e.g. take-off and climb).|$|E
40|$|<b>Bleed-air</b> {{systems in}} {{passenger}} aircraft are often prone to limit cycle oscillations. Tuning of such systems makes additional flight-tests necessary, generating large expenses. In this paper, several control approaches {{to improve the}} performance of <b>bleed-air</b> systems are compared. These approaches combine a base-controller with stiction-compensation techniques. The different approaches are implemented, optimized and evaluated using a high-fidelity <b>bleed-air</b> system model, described in the equation-based modelling language Modelica. Results indicate that interaction between different valves should be reduced as much as possible. If a suitable base control approach is chosen, {{the influence of a}} superimposed stiction compensation technique seems to be small...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{passenger}} airplanes use <b>bleed-air</b> to {{keep the}} cabin well pressurized and tempered for comfortable and safe travel conditions. The high pressurized <b>bleed-air</b> from the aircraft engine therefore has to be expanded and controlled to a constant mass flow. The <b>bleed-air</b> system, doing this job, consists of three valves connected through pipes. The state of art is PI control of the valves, applied in flight tests. Experience shows that in practice limit cycles occur, downgrading performance. The challenge of control consists in the little control authority, the high friction in the valves causing stick-slip action and the coupling of three valves. Three approaches are followed for developing new control strategies. The first one provides a centralized controller for all valves. Second applies different stiction compensation techniques handling the high friction level and last tries to decouple the valves through a feedforward control at the second valve. The three concepts are combined to nine controller variations. For comparing the approaches and their interdependency, each of the resulting controllers is adjusted to the <b>bleed-air</b> system model using global optimization. Thereby movement and integrated absolute error are rated. Effectiveness and robustness of the approaches are discussed. It is showed, that feedforward control and I-Gain Tuning account for significant control improvement. Finally, suggestions for {{improving the quality of}} model-based developing for <b>bleed-air</b> systems are derived from the experiments...|$|E
40|$|The {{technology}} {{data base}} for powered lift aircraft design has advanced {{over the last}} 15 years. NASA's Quiet Short Haul Research Aircraft (QSRA) has provided a flight verification of upper surface blowing (USB) technology. The A- 6 Circulation Control Wing flight demonstration aricraft has provide data for circulation control wing (CCW) technology. Recent small scale wind tunnel model tests and full scale static flow turning test have shown the potential of combining USB with CCW technology. A flight research program is deemed necessary to fully explore the performance and control aspects of CCW jet substitution for the mechanical USB Coanda flap. The required hardware design would also address questions {{about the development of}} flight weight ducts and CCW jets and the engine <b>bleed-air</b> capabilities vs requirements. NASA's QSRA would be an optimum flight research vehicle for modification to the USB/CCW configuration. The existing QSRA data base, the design simplicity of the QSRA wing trailing edge controls, availability of engine <b>bleed-air,</b> and the low risk, low cost potential of the suggested program is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{technical}} issues affecting supersonic STOL development as an airbase attack fighter are discussed. An Air Force study has indicated that, from a weight and cost standpoint, the preferred directions will include two-dimensional nozzles with vectoring and thrust reversing capability. Take-off and landing requirements would determine other design features, {{and the use}} of a jump strut to enable landing maneuvers to be made at pitch angles which would normally drag the tail is detailed. The addition of a tip-mounted reaction control system is foreseen as necessary for roll control at the low aerodynamic speeds of STOL landing. A severe 700 ft landing distance design is outlined, and includes a lifting engine with <b>bleed-air</b> features to feed the reaction control system...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication by the AIAA and the definitive published version is available at [URL] paper documents the installation of a fast jet military aircraft Environmental Control System (ECS) ground test facility. The system used {{in this case is}} a <b>bleed-air</b> driven two-wheel bootstrap cycle with low pressure water extraction. The facility allows the ECS to be run at conditions similar to those in the aircraft during ground operation. Data from the rig is presented and used to validate a 1 -D thermodynamic model. The relationships between aircraft altitude and speed against ECS Coefficient of Performance and system heat rejection are presented, seamlessly utilising both experimental and modelled data. Furthermore, a scenario depicting a ram air blockage in the secondary heat exchanger demonstrates the systemâ€™s ability to mask faults. The physical system is used for component-level analysis, whilst the model extends this to system-level. General attributes of the system operation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The semi-enclosed and {{pressurized}} {{nature of}} the aircraft cabin results in a highly dynamic environment. The dynamic conditions establish spatiotemporal dependent environmental characteristics. Characterization of aircraft cabin environmental and <b>bleed-air</b> conditions have traditionally been done with stand-alone measurement systems which, by their very nature, cannot provide the necessary sensor coverage in such an environment. To this purpose, a prototype wireless sensor network system has been developed that can be deployed in the aircraft cabin environment. Each sensor node in the system incorporates the ability to measure common aircraft contaminants such as particulate matter and carbon dioxide, along with other key environmental factors such as temperature, air pressure, humidity, and sound pressure level. The wireless sensor network enables the collection of time-correlated results from the aircraft cabin, passing sensor data to a central collection point for storage or real-time monitoring. This paper discusses the results of testing this sensor system in a mockup of the Boeing 767 aircraft cabin environment. In this series of tests, both particulate matter and carbon dioxide were introduced into the simulated aircraft environment and measured using an array of 16 wirelessly connected sensor nodes.
