The Regency style, typical of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, is characterised by pale stuccoed exteriors with Classical-style mouldings and bay windows. Even the modest two-storey terraced houses which spread rapidly across the steeply sloping landscape in the mid-19th century display some elements of this style.

2500|$|The Barking Riverside {{development}} {{is part of}} the London Riverside project, which aims to regenerate the Thames riverside area of East London through new homes, jobs, and services. Barking Riverside consists of [...] of brownfield land and therefore needs site clearance and the removal of overhead power lines before it can go ahead. Construction began in 2008, with completion due around 2025. 10,000 homes are to be built, housing around 25,000 people. New transport links will be provided, including East London Transit and the extension of the Docklands Light Railway at Barking Riverside DLR station, and City Hall is seeking £150 million to extend the Gospel Oak to Barking Line of the London Overground from Barking railway station to Barking Riverside. Barking and Dagenham Council has said that it does not believe the 10,800-home <b>brownfield</b> <b>development</b> to be viable without improved transport connections, and expects that the Treasury is likely to confirm funding in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Autumn 2013 statement, due to be made on 4 December 2013. The development will also provide new public facilities, creating [...] "a variety of living, working, leisure and cultural amenities". Two new primary schools and one secondary school will be built, and the public will have access to two kilometres of Thames river front. The Rivergate Centre, designed by van Heyningen and Haward Architects, provides the civic facilities for the initial phase of Barking Riverside, while a new square and 3FE primary school, which includes embedded community facilities, a nursery, church, flexible office suites for the PCT and Community Development Trust, as well as a MUGA and sports pitches are also planned. As yet unbuilt, the second phase provides 90 flats, local shops and a neighbourhood police post.|$|E

40|$|Reducing {{greenhouse}} gas emissions (GHG) is an important social goal to mitigate climate change. A common mitigation paradigm is to consider strategy ‘wedges’ {{that can be applied}} to different activities to achieve desired GHG reductions. In this dissertation, I consider a wide range of possible travel demand reduction and traffic congestion management strategies to reduce light-duty vehicle GHG emissions. To estimate the cost savings associated with the implementation of various travel demand and traffic congestion management strategies, performance measures such as speed, delay, and travel time were assessed for each strategy. These performance measures were then combined with emission factors – amount of pollutants per speed interval – and monetary damage values of each pollutant in terms of mortality, morbidity and environmental damages – dollar per gram of pollutant – to estimate the external environmental cost savings resulting from the implemented strategy. Fuel and time cost savings were simply measured by incorporating the value of time and fuel. Specifically, the external environmental cost of driving in the U. S. including congestion was estimated to be about $ 110 billion annually. <b>Brownfield</b> <b>developments</b> and LEED certified <b>brownfield</b> <b>developments</b> were assessed as land use and travel demand management strategies to reduce vehicular travel demand. Impacts of these residential developments on vehicle miles traveled (VMT) reduction and the resulting costs (cost of driving time, fuel, and external air pollution costs) were examined. Results show with minimal implementation cost incurred by transportation authorities (about 75 - 95 % less than other VMT reduction measures), both <b>brownfield</b> residential <b>developments</b> and LEED certified <b>brownfield</b> residential <b>developments</b> can be beneficial travel demand strategies, assisting federal, state and local governments with their GHG emissions reduction goals. Compared with conventional <b>developments,</b> residential <b>brownfield</b> <b>developments</b> can reduce VMT and its consequential environmental costs by about 52 and 66 percent respectively. LEED certified residential <b>brownfield</b> <b>developments</b> can have an additional 1 % to 12 % VMT reduction and a 0. 03 % to 3. 5 % GHG reduction compared with conventional developments. In addition to land use and travel demand management strategies, a number of supply congestion management measures were also assessed. Traffic signal timing and coordination is an effective congestion management strategy. However, not maintaining the timings regularly to assure they respond to vehicle volumes may result in 18 percent increase in the cost of fuel consumed, 13 percent in the cost of travel time and 11 percent in the external environmental costs annually. Other supply management strategies assessed were cases of adaptive traffic control system and high occupancy toll (HOT) lanes. In comparison to one another, while adaptive traffic signal control system results in 7 to 12 percent external environmental cost saving, HOT lanes show zero external environmental cost savings. Driving patterns and speed profiles have significant impacts on the emission of the criteria air pollutants. In some cases, speed improvements resulting from the implementation of a congestion management measure may, in fact, result in the emission of additional criteria air pollutants, thus increasing the external environmental costs. Other interdependencies such as induced demand were also examined. Results show that induced demand from excess capacity resulting from an implementation of a supply congestion management strategy can be significant enough to reduce the benefits gained from the implemented measure {{in a short period of}} time. In addition to analyzing travel demand management, land use changes and congestion management, strategies including fuel and vehicle options and low carbon and renewable power are briefly discussed in this work. I conclude that no one strategy will be sufficient to meet GHG emissions reduction goals to avoid climate change. However, many of these changes have positive combinatorial effects, so the best strategy is to pursue combinations of transportation GHG reduction strategies to meet reduction goals. Agencies need to broaden their agendas to incorporate such combinations in their planning...|$|R
