5|$|That evening, Anya {{falls asleep}} on Giles' sofa while Spike takes a mugful of {{blood from the}} refrigerator. Xander enters Giles' {{apartment}} as Spike, his mouth wet with blood, <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> pick up something that he dropped {{in front of the}} sofa where Anya sleeps. Inferring that Spike bit and drank from Anya, Xander pummels him ferociously until Anya wakes and stops him; excited that he fought to defend her, Anya gestures that they should go have sex.|$|E
25|$|From the 15th {{century in}} the Netherlands onwards, it was more usual to show the non-Biblical subject of the Holy Family resting on the journey, the Rest on the Flight to Egypt, often {{accompanied}} by angels, and in earlier images sometimes an older boy who may represent, James the Brother of the Lord, interpreted as a son of Joseph, by a previous marriage. The background to these scenes usually (until the Council of Trent tightened up on such additions to scripture) includes a number of apocryphal miracles, and gives {{an opportunity for the}} emerging genre of landscape painting. In the Miracle of the corn the pursuing soldiers interrogate peasants, asking when the Holy Family passed by. The peasants truthfully say it was when they were sowing their wheat seed; however the wheat has miraculously grown to full height. In the Miracle of the idol a pagan statue falls from its plinth as the infant Jesus passes by, and a spring gushes up from the desert (originally separate, these are often combined). In further, less commonly seen, legends a group of robbers abandon their plan to rob the travellers, and a date palm tree <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> allow them to pluck the fruit.|$|E
500|$|His despair gone, Bemis contentedly sorts {{the books}} he {{looks forward to}} reading for years to come. Just as he <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> pick up the first book, he stumbles, and his glasses fall off and shatter. In shock, {{he picks up the}} broken remains of the glasses he is {{virtually}} blind without, and says, [...] "That's not fair. That's not fair at all. There was time now. There was—was all the time I needed…! It's not fair! [...] It's not fair!" [...] and bursts into tears, surrounded by books he now can never read.|$|E

60|$|Thus began {{a time of}} {{love and}} joy. As soon as her work was over and she had {{finished}} tea, Liza would slip out and at some appointed spot meet Jim. Usually {{it would be at}} the church, where the Westminster Bridge Road <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> get to the river, and they would go off, arm-in-arm, till they came to some place where they could sit down and rest. Sometimes they would walk along the Albert Embankment to Battersea Park, and here sit on the benches, watching the children play. The female cyclist had almost abandoned Battersea for the parks {{on the other side of}} the river, but often enough one went by, and Liza, with the old-fashioned prejudice of her class, would look after the rider and make some remark about her, not seldom more forcible than ladylike. Both Jim and she liked children, and, tiny, ragged urchins would gather round to have rides on the man's knees or mock fights with Liza.|$|E
60|$|But {{though the}} friends and scenes of his {{childhood}} had fallen back so swiftly into the far horizon, he was not lonely. His heart found a lovelier, if not a healthier home, than it had ever known before. For during those four peaceful and busy months of study there had sprung up between Hypatia and the beautiful boy one of those pure and yet passionate friendships--call them rather, with St. Augustine, by the sacred name of love--which, fair and holy as they are when they link youth to youth, or girl to girl, reach their full perfection only between man and woman. The unselfish adoration with which a maiden may bow down before some strong and holy priest, or with which an enthusiastic boy may cling to the wise and tender matron, who, amid the turmoil of the world, and the pride of beauty, and the cares of wifehood, <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> with counsel and encouragement--earth knows no fairer bonds than these, save wedded love itself. And that second relation, motherly rather than sisterly, had bound Philammon with a golden chain to the wondrous maid of Alexandria.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Wouldn't you indeed?' said Edgar quietly, in a nonchalant {{tone that}} made the younger lads <b>bend</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> sniggle behind their desks, while {{he moved on to}} the staircase.|$|R
6000|$|Bubbles {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fascinating}} of sports. There is the soft foamy mass, like driven snow, or like whipped cream. Blanche <b>bends</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> blow [...] "a honeycomb," [...] holding the bowl of the pipe in the water; at her gurgling blasts there slowly heaves upwards the pile of larger, clearer bubbles, each reflecting the whole scene, and sparkling with rainbow tints, until Aubrey ruthlessly dashes all into fragments with his hand, and Mary pronounces it stiff enough, and presents a pipe to little Daisy, who, drawing the liquid into her mouth, throws it away with a grimace, and declares that she does not like bubbles! But Aubrey stands with swelled cheeks, gravely puffing at the sealing-waxed extremity. Out pours a confused assemblage of froth, but the glassy globe slowly expands the little branching veins, flowing down on either side, bearing an enlarging miniature of the sky, the clouds, the tulip-tree. Aubrey pauses to exclaim! but where is it? Try again! A proud bubble, as Mary calls it, a peacock, in blended pink and green, is this transparent sphere, reflecting and embellishing house, wall, and shrubs! It is too beautiful! It is gone! Mary undertakes to give a lesson, and blows deliberately without the slightest result. Again! She waves her disengaged hand in silent exultation as the airy balls detach themselves, and float off on the summer breeze, with a tardy, graceful, uncertain motion. Daisy rushes after them, catches at them, and looks at her empty fingers with a puzzled [...] "All gone!" [...] as plainly expressed by Toby, who snaps at them, and shakes his head with offended dignity at the shock of his meeting teeth, while the kitten frisks after them, striking at them with her paw, amazed at meeting vacancy.|$|E
