5|$|The aquatics {{events at}} the 2015 Pan American Games were {{scheduled}} to be held roughly {{around the same time}} as the 2015 World Aquatics Championships scheduled in Kazan, Russia. In order to maintain the quality of its fields, the schedule of the five aquatics disciplines had to be changed to accommodate athletes. The synchronized swimming competition was moved to the day <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> ceremony, diving events began on the day of the opening ceremony (when events are traditionally not held on the day of the ceremony), open water swimming was moved to the first weekend of the games, swimming was reduced to a five-day schedule (down from seven in 2011), and water polo competitions began three days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> ceremony. All events were scheduled to be completed by July 24, six days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> ceremonies of the World Championships, which in itself was moved back a week to accommodate the games. The change in schedule meant that for the first time, events were held <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Andorra {{made its}} début in the Summer Paralympics, having already made three {{appearances}} at the Winter Paralympics. Malawi, {{which would have}} been making its debut at the Games, and Botswana, were both due to send delegations but withdrew hours <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> ceremony citing a lack of government funds.|$|E
5|$|Shortly <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening,</b> Ravenscroft {{appointed}} Robert Newman as manager. Newman {{had already}} had three different careers, as a stockjobber, a bass soloist, and a concert agent. The rest of his career {{was associated with the}} Queen's Hall, and the names of the hall and the manager became synonymous.|$|E

5|$|A {{museum was}} opened inside the {{preserved}} building {{to mark the}} 100th birthday of Mikhail Bulgakov on May 15, 1991. The upper floor of the museum houses an exhibition of various Bulgakov objects, and the lower floor contains thematic exhibitions. The house, built in 1888 and designed by architect N. Gardenin, was thoroughly renovated <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of the museum. A memorial plaque with Bulgakov's portrait is now hanging {{on the front of}} the building.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of the Barlow Road, pioneers {{traveling}} by {{land from the}} east followed the Oregon Trail to Wascopam Mission (now The Dalles) and floated down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver, then a perilous and expensive journey. It was also possible to drive livestock over Lolo Pass {{on the north side}} of Mount Hood, but that trail was too rugged for vehicles and unsuitable for wagons.|$|E
5|$|During its brief span of activity, the Ohio Works team faced {{challenges}} that reflected common difficulties within the Ohio–Pennsylvania League, including weak {{financial support for}} teams. Following a dispute over funding, the team's owners sold the club to outside investors, {{just a few months}} <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of the 1907 season.|$|E

Events began three days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> ceremony on July 7 and ended with the closing ceremony on July 26.|$|E
5|$|There were {{setbacks}} with distribution, however. United Artists, {{which had}} {{ownership of the}} movie, changed hands and the new owners {{had no interest in}} the movie. Carradine bought the movie back from U.A., and set out to find a distributor. The picture was picked up by Crown International, which specialized in teen exploitation films. Just two weeks <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> was scheduled, Carradine was still shooting some additional scenes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of Melbourne Airport, Melbourne's main {{airport was}} Essendon Airport which was officially {{designated}} an {{international airport in}} 1950. In the mid-1950s, over 10,000 passengers were using Essendon Airport and the limitations of Essendon Airport were beginning to become apparent. Essendon Airport's facilities were insufficient to meet the increasing demand for air travel; the runways were too short to handle the then new jet airliners and the terminals failed to handle the increase in passengers, by the mid-1950s, an international overflow terminal was built in a new northern hangar. Due to the encroachment of the urban boundary, the airport had become surrounded by residential housing, meaning that expansion of Essendon Airport was not possible.|$|E

5|$|Built by J.W.Walker and Sons, {{the organ}} was {{completed}} {{only two days}} <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of the cathedral in 1967. Made {{as an integral part}} of the new cathedral, the architect, Frederick Gibberd, saw the casework as part of his brief and so designed the striking front to the organ. Using decorative woodwork, Gibberd was inspired by the innovative use of the pipes at Coventry Cathedral and the Royal Festival Hall and so arranged the shiny zinc pipes and brass trumpets en chamade to contrast strikingly with concrete pillars which surround the organ.|$|E
5|$|Few railway tunnels {{exist in}} Victoria, with the {{exception}} of the Melbourne City Loop. The longest tunnel <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of the loop was on the Fyansford Cement Works Railway (near Geelong), where a 1300 metre long tunnel existed on a narrow gauge quarry railway. Of those open today the longest is the single track 422 metre long Geelong Tunnel, followed by the double track 385 metre Elphinstone and the 390 metre long Big Hill Tunnels on the Bendigo line. A 154 metre long tunnel also exists on the Healesville line, as well as three tunnels on the suburban Hurstbridge line, and another on the freight lines under Footscray station.|$|E
5|$|In total 575 medals {{were awarded}} in 187 events in 10 {{different}} sports. Of the 42 competing National Paralympic Committees (NPCs) 31 won {{at least one}} medal. The host nation won the most gold medals, with 28, and the United States won the most total medals with 74. Rhodesia competed at these Games, winning 12 medals, but did not take part at the 1972 Summer Olympics after their invitation was withdrawn by the International Olympic Committee, four days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> ceremony, in response to African countries' protests against the Rhodesian regime. This medal table ranks the competing NPCs {{by the number of}} gold medals won by their athletes.|$|E

5|$|The 2015 World Archery Championships were {{scheduled}} later in July, to not {{conflict with the}} games, while the 2015 World Fencing Championships (which finished one day {{prior to the start}} of fencing competitions at the Pan-Am Games) were coordinated to allow athletes to compete at both events. Finally the second round of the 2015 Davis Cup was moved ahead one week to not conflict with the tennis competitions. Tennis competitions were held <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> ceremony, to allow athletes to compete in both events.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel was budgeted to cost NOK496 million, {{but ended}} up costing NOK487 million. It opened along with the Stord Bridge on 27 December 2000. Six hours <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening,</b> {{the bottom of the}} tunnel was used for a wedding. The toll company held a course for people with fear of tunnels to master their fears, with 60 people participating. The {{official}} opening took place on 30 April 2001. When it opened, it was the longest and second-deepest subsea tunnel in Europe and Norway, after the Hitra Tunnel.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the seventh}} and last League Cup final to be played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of the new Wembley Stadium, the final's {{traditional}} venue. The match was broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Sky Sports 1; the channel's coverage averaged at 2.7 million viewers, with a peak audience of 3.2 million (24.88%) at 5pm. At {{the time it was}} the biggest multichannel audience of 2007, overtaking a football match between Arsenal and Manchester United in January.|$|E

5|$|Twenty-two teams {{participated in}} the 2013 edition of the Tour de France. All of the {{nineteen}} UCI ProTeams were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race. On 27 April 2013, the organiser of the Tour, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), announced the three second-tier UCI Professional Continental teams given wildcard invitations, {{all of which were}} French-based. The presentation of the teams took place at the harbour of Porto-Vecchio on the island of Corsica on 27 June, two days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> stage held in the town. Each team arrived by boat to the stage, before being introduced to the crowd.|$|E
5|$|After {{six years}} at the Kestrels, the {{defection}} saw Kydd forced {{to adapt to a}} new shooting combination with veteran international Sharelle McMahon. As she had had little opportunity to train with the new team <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of the season, the pair initially had some difficulty adjusting to each other's style. After a tenuous start, however, the pair found form, and were able to form a relatively successful combination. Kydd scored 360 goals in the season, and assisted the Phoenix in becoming the top scoring side for the season, although occasionally patchy form from the team as a whole saw the Phoenix slip outside the top two at season's end. Kydd was overlooked for a return to international selection during the 2006–07 season.|$|E
5|$|By April 2000, {{the number}} of {{services}} by the main airlines was reduced to less than the level <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> of Gardermoen, with 75 daily departures. Braathens had 33 daily departures, SAS had 22 and Widerøe had 20. Of Braathens' services, 14 were to Oslo, 15 to cities on the West Coast (of which four were operated by Norwegian Air Shuttle) and four were to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø. SAS operated 15 daily flights to Oslo, while eight were operated to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø. One flight was to their main hub in Copenhagen. This was the last year that SAS used DC-9s to Trondheim, phasing in Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft, supplemented by occasional MD-80s. Widerøe had 15 daily flights to STOLports in Helgeland, and five flights to Sandefjord.|$|E
