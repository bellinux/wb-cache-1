40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} meaningfulness of a year's worth of audit data {{relating}} {{to all the}} inpatients of one consultant general surgeon and to question the usefulness of certain outcome measures. DESIGN [...] Analysis of records entered on to audit computer (Dunnfile) and relating to inpatient episodes for one consultant general surgeon over one year. Data obtained were compared with ward records and the patient administration system to check their accuracy. SETTING [...] The three hospitals and 12 wards in Brighton health district where the surgeon admitted patients. SUBJECTS [...] 859 Records relating to inpatient episodes from 1 January to 31 December 1988. These covered 655 main procedures and 79 secondary procedures performed at the same time. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Procedures were analysed by complexity of operation (BUPA code) and grade of surgeon; complications were counted and rates constructed by surgeon and by BUPA code: returns to theatre were analysed. RESULTS [...] Simple counts revealed some data, such {{as the fact that}} one registrar performed more major operations (32) than the senior registrars (22 and 14), and an analysis of complications showed that he had a lower complication rate (11. 4 % v 20. 0 % and 19. 4 %). But the simple complication rate disclosed nothing about whether the complication was avoidable. Likewise, the number of returns to theatre needed further qualification. Analysis of data collection for February to April 1988 showed a 30 % deficit of information on the audit system compared with ward records and prompted a re-examination of everyone's role in collecting data. After the year's audit there was still a 17 % shortfall compared with the district's patient administration system, though some of this was accounted for by a <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] It is difficult to ensure adequate data collection and entails everyone in an unfamiliar discipline. Connecting the audit system to the patient administration system would help.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 83 - 84). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Improving project schedule performance is critical to project success in many industries. Resource allocation {{has been used as a}} tool for improving project schedule performance. Common resource allocation policies allocate the same fraction of available resources to each activity as the fraction of total demand for resources created by the current <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for that activity. Such a Proportional Resource Allocation Policy can be myopic because it does not account for future demand of resources. To consider future demand of resources to improve the resource allocation policy, a Foresighted Resource Allocation Policy model was proposed by Ford and Joglekar (2002) using system dynamics with control theory. Management delays, backlog changes created by processing work, and the rework cycle are primary drivers of project schedule performance. The backlog changes reflect the progress of development work and the nature of the project development processes. Project managers cannot directly control the change of backlog. However, management delays can be influenced by project managers directly. Therefore, the tuning of management delays is a potentially effective way to improve resource allocation policies to achieve shortened project duration. This research suggested a way of improving project performance with resource allocation policies. Two managerial decisions were considered: 1) proportional or foresighted resource demand estimates; and 2) the delay of management, and delay in resource allocation (i. e. resource adjustment time). Optimal Resource Adjustment Time is a management delay in resource allocation policies that results in minimum project duration. Hypotheses concerning the impacts of rework and uncertainty on Optimal Resource Adjustment Time and how management delays (i. e. resource adjustment time) impact schedule performance are tested with a dynamic simulation model. Results support the tuning of resource adjustment times to reduce project duration and explain how increasing uncertainty in adjustment time can reduce project duration. Impacts on practices and research are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Viewpoint ArticleViewpoint: Design for Manufacturing Assembly Automation AA 32 - 2 (Design for Manufacturing) At {{this time}} of writing, the latest Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) {{indicated}} that the UK Manufacturing has hit a 28 -month low. As output, new orders and employment have declined; the UK manufacturing sector fell back into contraction to its lowest level since June 2009. It {{is a sign of}} low market confidence and uncertainty. In the report, the most worrying aspect is that new orders have nose dived most since March 2009 and output is now sustained through a <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> The traditional manufacturing industries that have kept the UK economy buoyant is facing bleak times {{and the fact that the}} Eurozone is also in a crisis. Despite these troubled times, the UK Government hopes that precision engineering and high-value manufacturing sector will create jobs and help tackle record youth unemployment. One such industry is the aviation sector where Design for Manufacturing has been used as a good industry practice so that products can be manufactured more easily without sacrificing safety. Fundamentally, this can be achieved through two principles: reducing the number of assembly operations by part reduction; or by making the assembly operation easier to perform. This has been something of a holy grail to manufacturing industries where part reduction, cutting the use of fasteners and light-weight materials are favourable for cost savings. Recently, the BBC featured an episode on “Making a Super Jumbo Wing” for the Airbus A 380 as part of the “How to Build” Series. The wing is the largest ever produced for a commercial aircraft at 17. 7 metres from front to back and 36. 3 metres from fuselage to wingtip. In the documentary, the manufacturer claims that shaving a thickness of 1 millimetre of material per wing equates to a reduction of 350 kilograms of weight, translating this to significant cost savings for the 238 A 380 s currently on order. Using the Design for Manufacturing approach has led to a new wing design with greater rigidity, better stability, more accurate aligning and reduced installation times without sacrificing safety. Rolls-Royce is another example of a high value manufacturer and applies the concept of "invent once and use many". For instance, the MT 30 turbines that are used to power the Queen Elizabeth aircraft carriers and other combat ships is based on the same technology as the Trent jet engine and shares a majority of the components. While the old saying that traditional manufacturing is slowing down is true, it contradicts the new growth of research, design, additive manufacture, precision engineering and high value production. Even more so, greater spin-off effects can be seen such as when British Prime Minister David Cameron opened a new high-tech £ 400 m Airbus factory at Broughton in October and said that the plane maker would safeguard thousands of jobs for many years to come. The factory employs 6000 people at the site with 650 jobs, and is considered as one of the largest manufacturing facilities built in recent years. But will this be enough to give the industry a sustainable future? Probably yes for the next few decades, but when other developing nations play the catch-up game in terms of technology, then we might inevitably need to rethink our manufacturing strategies. * Dr Eujin Pei works as a Senior Lecturer at De Montfort University in the United Kingdom with a research interest in additive manufacture and inclusive design...|$|E

Napoleon was seeking to develop inland waterway connections throughout the country, and the Rhône-Rhine link was of such strategic importance that he gave his name to the project.

Works were completed in 1833. Upgrading to Freycinet standards started in 1882, and the summit level was lowered, reducing the number of locks.

In August 1952, two new B class diesel-electric locomotives established their credentials during trials by hauling a 1,121 ton goods train up Ingliston Bank and covering in 44 minutes the same distance two A2 class locomotives took to haul a 690-ton load in 67 minutes. The B class locomotives proved their ability to provide the same (if not better) performance as the H class, but without the heavy axle load and requirements for upgraded infrastructure.

When congestion is negligible, the optimal policy is state invariant. In the more complex case of non-negligible congestion, this result no longer holds. For studied scenarios, numerical results indicate that operating margins may decrease 10 % for reasonable-length port-of-entry closures, that margins may be eliminated completely without contingency plans, and expected holding and penalty costs may increase 20 % for anticipated increases in port-of-entry utilization...|$|R
40|$|Make-to-order {{companies}} {{are in the}} business of supplying products in response to a customer order in competition with other companies, on the basis of price, technical expertise, delivery time and reliability in meeting due dates. Dealing properly with enquiries is the major problem that MTO companies face. A lack of co-ordination between sales and production at the customer enquiry stage often leads to confirmed orders being delivered later than promised and/or being produced at a loss. The treatment of an enquiry is a multi-stage decision process. The initial decision is whether or not to prepare a bid, and if so, how much effort to put into the specification and estimation process. The MTO company has the choice of putting in a lot of effort to prepare a competitive bid or making a quick estimate with a high safety margin to allow for errors and unforeseen problems expecting further later negotiation with the customer. Consideration has to be given to the likely accuracy of the cost estimates produced. The feasibility of being able to produce the order with the current work load at different delivery times needs to be evaluated together with any extra costs incurred. An input/output planning approach based on the control of a hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>backlogs</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> is proposed to produce a dynamic capacity planning model to determine the capacity to provide at each work centre in future time periods, allocating overtime, transferring operators, process as split batches etc. In setting the price and lead time to quote to the customer, the probability of winning the order plays an important role. A model based on a chi-squared analysis of data on past enquiries is proposed to divide the market into sectors of similar orders. It is extended to produce a strike rate matrix for each sector giving the probability if winning orders in that sector as a function of the price and lead time quoted.
