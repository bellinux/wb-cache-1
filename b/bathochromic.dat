Löwig' route involved treating an Sn/K and Sn/Na alloys with iodoethane, in the presence of quartz sand which was used to control the reaction rate. Products with elemental compositions close to those of oligo(diethylstannane)s or poly(diethylstannane) were obtained. Cahours obtained similar products and attributed the formation of the so-called [...] "stannic ethyl" [...] to a reaction of the Wurtz type. Already in 1858, [...] "stannic ethyl" [...] was formulated as a polymeric compound denoted with the composition n(SnC4H5). In 1917 Grüttner, who reinvestigated results on hexaethyl-distannanes(H5C2)3Sn-Sn(C2H5)3 (reported by Ladenburg in 1870) confirmed the presence of Sn-Sn bonds and predicated {{for the first time that}} tin could form chain like compounds. In 1943, it was postulated that “diphenyltin” exists as a type of polymeric material because of its yellow color 8, and indeed a <b>bathochromic</b> shift of the wavelength at maximum absorption with increasing number of Sn atoms was found later in the case of oligo(dibutylstannane)s comprising up to 15 Sn atoms.|$|E
40|$|Phytochromes are red/far-red photoreceptors that mediate {{a variety}} of photomorphogenic {{processes}} in plants including germination, shade avoidance, and flowering. Phytochromes are dimeric chromopeptides and have two spectral photoisomers, the red-light absorbing Pr and far-red light absorbing Pfr forms. In nature, phytochromes recognize the ratio of red and far-red light (R: FR ratio) from incoming light, changing the photoequilibrium of the Pr and Pfr forms to induce light responses. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop and characterize the in vivo function of <b>bathochromic</b> mutant phytochromes whose Pr-absorption spectra move to longer wavelength so that they can be activated even at low R: FR ratios to suppress shade avoidance in plants. ^ Photochromism of phytochromes is based on an intimate interaction between the chromophore and the protein moiety. Thus, the <b>bathochromic</b> mutants were developed by changing highly conserved amino acid residues in the bilin lyase domain of oat (Avena) phytochrome A. From the photochemical characterization of purified phytochrome mutants, several absorption wavelength-shifted mutants were obtained, including the <b>bathochromic</b> mutants, F 389 A with a 6 nm shift, F 307 R/C 371 A with an 8 nm shift and F 307 W/Y 385 A/F 389 A with a 12 nm shift, as well as hypsochromic mutants including R 317 E with an 8 nm shift. These data indicate that absorption maxima of phytochromes could be modified by changing the interaction between the chromophore and the amino acid residues in the chromophore-binding region. ^ Selected <b>bathochromic</b> phytochrome genes were introduced into phyA-deficient Arabidopsis. Using Arabidopsis transgenic plants, tolerance to shade was examined in both seedlings and adult plants under different shaded conditions. The transgenic Arabidopsis with <b>bathochromic</b> phytochromes displayed a suppression of hypocotyl elongation in seedlings under shaded conditions, and exhibited leaf morphologies indicative of shade tolerance in adult plants. Furthermore, plants expressing the 8 -nm <b>bathochromic</b> phytochrome showed a greater degree of shade tolerance than those expressing the 6 -nm <b>bathochromic</b> phytochrome (270 % vs. 220 % compared to wild-type Col- 0 plants). In addition, floral initiation mediated by shade avoidance responses under FR enriched white light was suppressed by the <b>bathochromic</b> phytochromes. In comparison, transgenic plants with a hypsochromic mutant displayed an increased sensitivity to shade. These results indicate that shade avoidance responses can be effectively suppressed by <b>bathochromic</b> phytochromes. Since shade avoidance is second only to disease as a cause of crop-yield losses, the <b>bathochromic</b> phytochromes will be used to develop shade tolerant plants providing increased crop yields. ...|$|E

40|$|Current {{applications}} of porphyrins {{in medicine and}} optics, such as photodynamic therapy or nonlinear absorption, increasingly {{require the use of}} far-red absorbing dyes. Modifications to the porphyrin structure to accommodate these conditions can be achieved by extending the conjugation of the porphyrin ?-system, which will cause a <b>bathochromic</b> shift in the absorption spectrum. Thus, conjugated porphyrin oligomers have found widespread use. However, past synthetic strategies have mainly targeted symmetric porphyrin dimers, trimers, and oligomers which limit the practical use of such chromophores. To further extend the absorption profile, a series of symmetric and unsymmetric dimeric and oligomeric porphyrin ?-?, meso-meso, ??-?? triply-fused systems were synthesised via oxidative coupling methods. This required an analysis and optimization of the various synthetic strategies.

40|$|THESIS 9715 The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop synthetic strategies for the construction of multiporphyrin arrays with enhanced ?-conjugation. Porphyrin oligomers with extended conjugation display a <b>bathochromic</b> shift in their absorption profiles and thus have a diverse range of potential optical applications. As Prof Senge?s group has interest in the areas of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and non-linear optics (NLO), the design of such oligomers took these into account. One method to enhance the <b>bathochromic</b> shift is via the creation of conjugatively linked porphyrin oligomers. In our work, a series of symmetric and unsymmetric dimeric and trimeric porphyrin systems which are connected via conjugated linkers, namely alkyne and phenylacetylene, were synthesised via palladium catalysed C-C coupling reactions. These novel unsymmetric dimers and symmetric trimers were synthesised via the incorporation of all substituents on the monomeric components prior to coupling. The majority of these conjugated arrays exhibited a significant <b>bathochromic</b> shift in their UV/vis absorption profiles, in particular the alkyne linked arrays which showed absorption greater than 720 nm.

The UV-spectroscopic comparison of the oligosilanes with germanium enriched oligosilanes and also with oligogermanes showed a remarkable uniform picture.
