Multiple bird species include Bewick's swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii), Eurasian bittern (Botaurus stellaris), Eurasian <b>bullfinch</b> (Pyrrhula pyrrhula), *Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), gadwall (Anas strepera), grasshopper warbler (Locustella naevia), hen harrier (Circus cyaneus), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), linnet (Carduelis cannabina), marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus), marsh tit (Poecile palustris), merlin (Falco columbarius), northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), peregrine (Falco peregrinus), reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), song thrush (Turdus philomelos), teal (Anas cracca), willow tit (Poecile montanus) and yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella).|$|E
5|$|Young {{birds are}} {{initially}} mainly fed on invertebrates, often collected from low foliage or under bushes {{rather than in}} the grassland preferred by the adults. Adults will roam up to 1km (1000yd) from the nest on pasture or ploughed land. After fledging the young may accompany their parents until the onset of winter. Individuals or pairs will defend one or more fruit-bearing trees throughout the winter, mistletoe being preferred where available, with holly as the first choice elsewhere. Although the thrush normally feeds on the ground or other trees, the defence of this resource conserves the fruit for later in the season when other food items are becoming scarce. The trees are defended against conspecifics, other thrushes and species such as the <b>bullfinch</b> and great spotted woodpecker. In years when there is an abundance of winter fruit, this strategy may be abandoned, with the mistle thrushes foraging in flocks. Conversely, in hard winters, the defender may be overwhelmed by large flocks of fieldfares, redwings or Bohemian waxwings.|$|E

500|$|Birch Moss Covert {{is a small}} {{woodland}} containing birch, alder and willow trees, as well {{as various}} species of flora and fauna. The small mammal population includes the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), which attract both kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) and sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus). Foxes, stoats, weasels, and badgers, are often seen. The area is part of Shell's estate, covering about [...] of land managed by the Cheshire Wildlife Trust. The trust also manages a small nature reserve located within Manchester United's training ground. This provides a habitat {{for a number of}} species including the red admiral butterfly (Vanessa atalanta), meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis), and grey partridge (Perdix perdix). Carrington Moss is home to the only recorded pairs of breeding grey partridge in Trafford. Six pairs of Eurasian <b>bullfinch</b> (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) were recorded in 2003. The reduction in the population of these and similar birds is attributed to modern farming methods, the loss of broad hedgerows, and the lack of winter stubble. Action for Nature in Trafford has therefore included the site in its Biodiversity Action Plan. The group intends to develop Carrington Moss as a home for other species, such as reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus). Stigmella continuella (a species of moth occurring in southern and north-west England) has been observed in the area.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, {{the eternal}} flame was shared {{for the first}} time in its history. On June 18, a U.S. Army honor guard {{accompanied}} Irish Minister of State Paul Kehoe, T.D., in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Kennedy grave site. An Irish Army officer, accompanied by an Irish Army honor guard, lit a lamp in a metal burner from the eternal flame. (The lamp and burner were created by the <b>Bullfinch</b> company, which also designed the torches for the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay.)

2500|$|Contrary to many frogs, {{which lay}} their eggs in water, coquís {{lay their eggs}} on palm tree leaves or other {{terrestrial}} plants. Abandoned bird nests are also used as nests by E. coqui. The bananaquit, Puerto Rican <b>bullfinch</b> and Puerto Rican tody share nests with the coquí. This method of reproduction allows the coquí to live in forests, mountains and other habitats without direct dependency on water. Since eggs are laid on land, coquís bypass the tadpole stage, proceeding to develop limbs within their eggs, rather than going through a metamorphosis as a larva in water. Thus, a fully independent froglet emerges from the egg, with a small tail that is lost shortly after. [...] This stage of direct development has allowed the coqui to become a successful terrestrial colonizer in tropical areas.|$|E

2500|$|She {{was named}} after her mother's {{favourite}} song, [...] "Miss Annabel Lee", and grew up as a country child at her family's former estates of Mount Stewart, Wynyard Park, and Londonderry House. She was educated at Southover Manor School in Sussex and Cuffy's Tutorial College in Oxford. [...] Awkward and shy in her youth, she was an avid reader, equestrian, and a Girl Guide for the <b>Bullfinch</b> Patrol. She transformed from an unconfident and self-described [...] "skinny, gauche young girl" [...] into a socialite during the 1950s and 1960s. Queen Elizabeth II attended her coming-out ball in 1952. As part of the London social circle, she is known for her sense of humour, down-to-earth personality, and love of children and dogs.

2500|$|The English {{name comes}} from the Old English ceaffinc, where ceaf is [...] "chaff" [...] and finc [...] "finch". The {{chaffinch}} {{is one of the}} many birds depicted in the marginal decoration of the 15th century English illuminated manuscript the Sherborne Missal. The English naturalist William Turner described the chaffinch in his book on birds published in 1544. Although the text is in Latin, Turner gives the English name as chaffinche and lists two folk names: sheld-appel and spink. The word sheld is a dialectal word meaning pied or multicoloured (as in shelduck). Appel may be related to Alp, an obsolete word for a <b>bullfinch.</b> The name spink is probably derived from the bird's call note. The names spink and [...] shell apple are among the many folk names listed for the chaffinch by Reverend Charles Swainson in his Provincial Names and Folk Lore of British Birds (1885).|$|E
2500|$|During his 1792 journey {{aboard the}} Columbia Rediviva, Gray noticed muddy waters flowing from shore {{and decided to}} {{investigate}} whether he might have encountered the [...] "Great River of the West". While waiting for favorable weather, on April 29, Gray spotted a ship and exchanged greetings with her. [...] This ship was the HMS Discovery commanded by British naval officer Captain George Vancouver. [...] The two captains met and discussed the geography of the coastlines: Gray told Vancouver about the large river he had attempted to enter in 1788, but Vancouver doubted a large river was at that latitude. [...] So Gray continued south, leaving the Strait of Juan de Fuca on April 30, 1792, trading for more pelts as the ship sailed. [...] On May 7, he took the Columbia into the estuarine bay of Grays Harbor, Washington. [...] (Gray himself actually named this <b>Bullfinch</b> Harbor, but Vancouver's after-the-fact choice was the name that stuck.) ...|$|E
