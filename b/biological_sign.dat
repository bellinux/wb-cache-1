40|$|The {{response}} of peripheral lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and the thyroid function were investigated in 50 female patients with asymptomatic thyroiditis (AT). None {{of them had}} overt hypothyroidism {{at the time of}} the bleeding but 26 of them were on thyroid substitution therapy. The lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) showed no significant difference between untreated patients and control subjects matched for age and sex, nor between 10 patients with at least one <b>biological</b> <b>sign</b> of hypothyroidism and their matched controls. In patients, thyroid hormones administration did not influence LTT. Values of LTT decreased with age. No correlation was found between LTT and serum levels of T 4, and T 3, basal TSH, peak TSH after TRH injection and thyroglobulin antibodies titer. When all the patients were considered, basal TSH levels were correlated with peak TSH and were negatively correlated with T 4. For peak TSH values, there was no correlation with T 3 and a negative correltion with T 4. In conclusion, the data show in AT: i) a normal LTT with PHA, ii) a lack of influence of the thyroid function on LTT, and iii) a possible influence of basal T 4 concentration even within the normal range on TSH secretion.

DESIGN [...] Prospective survey of all patients in France with kala-azar diagnosed {{over the two}} years 1986 - 7. Information was obtained from parasitology laboratories in regional hospitals and all hospital laboratories and haematology departments capable of diagnosing leishmaniasis {{in the south of}} France. SETTING [...] 107 public hospitals in France. PATIENTS [...] 89 patients with kala-azar. INTERVENTIONS [...] All patients were treated with drugs. In the first instance meglumine antimonate was given to all but two patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Prevalence of the various clinical and biological features of kala-azar; proportion of patients with HIV infection. RESULTS [...] Half (44) of the patients were children under 8 years old. Seventy patients acquired the disease in France. Imported kala-azar was acquired mainly in Mediterranean countries (9 / 18 cases).

Joycean critics have paid little attention to the parent-offspring schisms mimetically mirrored in Joyce's fiction. Freudian (or Lacanian) psychoanalysis and other poststructuralist criticism have mainly either delved into Joycean multi-voiced narrative of free indirect style as a departure from realism or read Joycean texts as Joyce's (or his characters') political struggles against Irish patriarchy {{at the turn of the}} century. My study shifts a focus from the stylistically or politically oriented approaches to Joyce's fiction to a sociobiological dimension to Joycean characters [...] -a neo-Darwinian approach to human development with adaptive implications of human behaviors. More specifically, I bring to light the parent-offspring schisms in the typical patterns of relationships in the Dublin families depicted in Dubliners, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and Stephen Hero. What is the most salient in the matter of Dubliners's familial interactions is overprotective and demanding motherhood in which a mother and a child are extremely interdependent on each other. The seemingly affectionate but tremendously intrusive mothers hinder their children's autonomy and independence, making them indecisive and timid. In A Portrait and Stephen Hero, Stephen displays a <b>biological</b> <b>sign</b> of inhibited temperament with fear of novelty as his inherited nature. At the same time, he grows into a person with rigid personality as the outcome of his adaptation to the sibling position as a firstborn child. As a Bildungsroman, A Portrait is read as Stephen's development into a person of adolescent egocentrism on the basis of his moral reasoning grounded in his personal values in conflict with sociocultural values. Stephen cognitively adapts from pre-adolescent moral absolutism to adolescent moral relativism by which he shows iconoclastic tendencies...|$|E

Four children (Patients 1 - 3, aged between 5. 5 and 6 years; Patient 4 aged 2 years 8 months) received intracerebral injections of an adeno-associated viral vector serotype rh. 10 -SGSH-IRES-SUMF 1 vector in a phase I/II clinical trial. All children were able to walk, but their cognitive abilities were abnormal and had declined (Patients 1 - 3). Patients 1 - 3 presented with brain atrophy.

40|$|Biosemiotic entropy {{involves}} {{the deterioration of}} <b>biological</b> <b>sign</b> systems. The genome is a coded sign system that is connected to phenotypic outputs through the interpretive functions of the tRNA/ribosome machinery. This symbolic sign system (semiosis) {{at the core of}} all biology has been termed &# 8220;biosemiosis&# 8221;. Layers of biosemiosis and cellular information management are analogous in varying degrees to the semiotics of computer programming, spoken, and written human languages. Biosemiotic entropy &# 8212; an error or deviation from a healthy state &# 8212; results from errors in copying functional information (mutations) and errors in the appropriate context or quantity of gene expression (epigenetic imbalance). The concept of biosemiotic entropy is a deeply imbedded assumption in the study of cancer biology. Cells have a homeostatic, preprogrammed, ideal or healthy state that is rooted in genomics, strictly orchestrated by epigenetic regulation, and maintained by DNA repair mechanisms. Cancer is an eminent illustration of biosemiotic entropy, in which the corrosion of genetic information via substitutions, deletions, insertions, fusions, and aberrant regulation results in malignant phenotypes. However, little attention has been given to explicitly outlining the paradigm of biosemiotic entropy in the context of cancer. Herein we distill semiotic theory (from the familiar and well understood spheres of human language and computer code) to draw analogies useful for understanding the operation of biological semiosis at the genetic level. We propose that the myriad checkpoints, error correcting mechanisms, and immunities are all systems whose primary role is to defend against the constant pressure of biosemiotic entropy, which malignancy must shut down in order to achieve advanced stages. In lieu of the narrower tumor suppressor/oncogene model, characterization of oncogenesis into the biosemiotic framework of sign, index, or object entropy may allow for more effective explanatory hypotheses for cancer diagnosis, with consequence in improving profiling and bettering therapeutic outcomes...|$|E
40|$|In workers chronically {{exposed to}} cadmium and without signs of renal insufficiency, plasma {{proteins}} with molecular weight ranging from 11, 800 to 450, 000 are excreted in greater amount in urine. Increased urinary excretion of {{low and high}} molecular weight proteins can occur independently. Because of its greater stability in urine and provided a sensitive immunological technique is used, the determination of retinol-binding protein is a more practical and reliable test of proximal tubular function than 02 -microglobulin. The evaluation of renal function of workers removed from cadmium exposure indicates that cadmium-induced renal lesions, albeit of slow progression, are not reversible when exposures ceases. In workers chronically exposed to cadmium or removed from cadmium exposure, metallothionein in urine is directly correlated with cadmium in urine but not with cadmium in blood or years of cadmium exposure. The association between cadmium in urine and metallothionein in urine is independent {{of the status of}} renal function and the intensity of current exposure to cadmium. Whereas the repeated IP injection of high doses of cadmium to rat gives rise to a mixed or tubular type proteinuria, the prolonged oral administration of cadmium results mainly {{in the development of a}} glomerular type proteinuria. The former is usually reversible after cessation of treatment whereas the latter is not. Circulating antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies have been found in man and in rat chronically exposed to cadmium. The pathogenic significance of this finding deserves further investigation.
