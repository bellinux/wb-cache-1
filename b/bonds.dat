Copper wafer <b>bonding</b> has been considered as a strong candidate for fabrication of three-dimensional integrated circuits (3 -D IC). This thesis work involves fundamental studies of copper wafer <b>bonding</b> and <b>bonding</b> performance of <b>bonded</b> interconnects. Copper <b>bonded</b> wafers exhibit good <b>bonding</b> qualities and present no original <b>bonding</b> interfaces when the <b>bonding</b> process occurs at 400 ⁰C/ 4000 mbar for 30 min, followed by nitrogen anneal at 400 ⁰C for 30 min. Oxide distribution in the <b>bonded</b> layer is uniform and sparse. Evolution of microstructure morphologies and grain orientations of copper <b>bonded</b> wafers during <b>bonding</b> and annealing were studied. The <b>bonded</b> layer reaches steady state after post-bonding anneal. The microstructure morphologies and <b>bond</b> strengths of copper <b>bonded</b> wafers under different <b>bonding</b> conditions were investigated. A map summarizing these results provides a useful reference on process conditions suitable for three-dimensional integration based on copper wafer <b>bonding.</b> Similar microstructure morphology of copper <b>bonded</b> interconnects was observed to that of copper <b>bonded</b> wafers. Specific contact resistances of <b>bonded</b> interconnects of approximately 10 ⁻⁸ [ohms]-cm² were measured by using a novel test structure which can eliminate the errors from misalignment during <b>bonding.</b> The <b>bonding</b> qualities of different interconnect sizes and densities have been investigated. In addition to increasing the <b>bonding</b> temperature and duration, options such as larger interconnect sizes, total <b>bonding</b> area, or use of dummy pads for <b>bonding</b> in the unused area {{improve the quality of}} <b>bonded</b> interconnects. Process development of silicon layer stacking based on Cu wafer <b>bonding</b> was successfully applied to demonstrate a strong four-layer-stack structure. <b>Bonded</b> Cu layers in this structure become homogeneous layers and do not show original <b>bonding</b> interfaces.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-four extracted caries-free premolars were divided into two equal groups. Group A represented the manual <b>bonding</b> technique and Group B represented the modified <b>bonding</b> technique. The shear <b>bond</b> strength was tested using the InstronTM machine. Descriptive statistical analysis and independent two-samples t test were employed to compare the data. RESULTS: The modified <b>bonding</b> technique (Group B) showed significantly higher tolerance to the applied load before the <b>bond</b> failure occurred (P= 0. 02). Also, Group B showed significantly higher degree of displacement of the <b>bonded</b> wire before <b>bond</b> failure (P= 0. 05).
