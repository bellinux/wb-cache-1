40|$|Many {{commercial}} {{hand tools}} {{have been designed}} without ergonomic principles in mind which can result in the occurrence of upper extremity trauma. In this study, therefore, a clamping hand tool, Quick-Grip ® <b>bar</b> <b>clamp,</b> was selected, ergonomically evaluated, {{a new version of}} the clamp focused on the handle was developed, and the original and ergonomically designed versions were compared using survey questionnaire. Design processes of the development of a new version were evaluation of the original clamp regarding ergonomic guidelines and anthropometric data, an idea sketch, prototype development, drafts and rendering of new design, development of final model, and objective and subjective comparisons to the original handle. Eleven male and eleven female students participated in the subjective testing portion which entailed questions after finishing simulated work. The results revealed that subjects were satisfied with the new version that was comfortable to hold and use in any position due to the rounded shape, the handle dimensions were appropriate, and no subjects reported pain in the hand. This study shows that application of ergonomics principles to the design of hand tools could increase usability and value of products and should be considered by manufacturers and designers...|$|E
40|$|The {{procedure}} is as follows: (1) Firmly <b>bar</b> <b>clamp</b> the box together in all directions. When all directions have been secured, tack weld each outside seam {{of the box}} in 4 or 5 places along it's length. Remove clamps and proceed to weld all outside seams. Care should be taken that the maximum weld cross section does not exceed 1 / 16 -inch x 1 / 16 -inch. (2) To help stabilize the metal as it cools, we will install all slot plugs, (MC- 223665), and one side cover plate, (MD- 223637). Inside welds for this side plate will be made thru the opposite side flange. Weld cross sections should be held to a 1 / 16 -inch maximum depth and width. (3) Weld {{the inside of the}} end plates, (MD- 224535), using the weld relief as filler material. After the box has cooled, weld the top plate (ME- 2244533) to the side flange, (ME- 224536) and then to the bottom plate (ME- 223534). (4) Repeat this procedure for the opposite side. (5) Helium leak check the welds, inside and out, by plugging the slot pumpout holes and pumping on the pumpout line. Remember that the clearances are very tight in the space that is to be pumpted. Allow plenty of time for a good pumpdown and leak check. Leak detection should be on the most sensitive scale on a helium leak detector with a minimum sensitivity of 10 - 9 ATM CC/SEC.

40|$|Background We have {{developed}} a novel head-holding device for behaving non-human primates that affords stability suitable for reliable chronic electrophysiological recording experiments. The device is completely non-invasive, and thus avoids the risk of infection and other complications that can occur {{with the use of}} conventional, surgically implanted head-fixation devices. New method The device consists of a novel non-invasive head mold and <b>bar</b> <b>clamp</b> holder, and is customized to the shape of each monkey's head. The head-holding device that we introduce, combined with our recording system and reflection-based eye-tracking system, allows for chronic behavioral experiments and single-electrode or multi-electrode recording, as well as manipulation of brain activity. Results and comparison with existing methods With electrodes implanted chronically in multiple brain regions, we could record neural activity from cortical and subcortical structures with stability equal to that recorded with conventional head-post fixation. Consistent with the non-invasive nature of the device, we could record neural signals {{for more than two years}} with a single implant. Importantly, the monkeys were able to hold stable eye fixation positions while held by this device, demonstrating the possibility of analyzing eye movement data with only the gentle restraint imposed by the non-invasive head-holding device. Conclusions We show that the head-holding device introduced here can be extended to the head holding of smaller animals, and note that it could readily be adapted for magnetic resonance brain imaging over extended periods of time.

40|$|Boring bar {{vibration}} during {{internal turning}} operations in machine tools is a pronounced {{problem in the}} manufacturing industry. Vibration may easily be induced by the workpiece’s material deformation process, due to the bar’s normally slender geometry. In order to overcome the vibration problem in internal turning active or/and passive control methods may be utilized. The level of success achieved by implementing such methods is directly dependent on the engineer’s knowledge of the dynamic properties of the system to be controlled. This thesis focuses predominantly on three steps {{in the development of}} an accurate model of an active boring bar. The first part considers the problem of building an accurate ” 3 -D” FE model of a standard boring bar used in industry. The influence of the FE model’s mesh density on the accuracy of the estimated spatial dynamic properties is addressed. With respect to the boring bar’s natural frequencies, the FE modeling also considers mass loading effects introduced by accelerometers attached to the boring bar. Experimental modal analysis results from the actual boring bar are used as a reference. The second part discusses analytical and experimental methods for modeling the dynamic properties of a boring <b>bar</b> <b>clamped</b> in a machine tool. For this purpose, Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko distributedparameter system models are used to describe the dynamics of the boring bar. Also, ” 1 -D” FE models with Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam elements have been developed in accordance with distributedparameter system models. A more complete ” 3 -D” FE model of the system ”boring <b>bar</b> - <b>clamping</b> house” has also been developed. Spatial dynamic properties of these models are discussed and compared with adequate experimental modal analysis results from the actual boring <b>bar</b> <b>clamped</b> in the machine tool. This section also investigates sensitivity of the spatial dynamic properties of the derived boring bar models to variation in the structural parameters’ values. The final part focuses on the development of a ” 3 -D” FE model of the system ”boring bar - actuator - clamping house”, with the purpose of simplifying the design procedure of an active boring bar. A linear model is addressed along with a model enabling variable contact between the clamping house and the boring bar with and without Coulomb friction in the contact surfaces. Based on these FE models’ fundamental bending modes, eigenfrequencies and mode shapes, control path frequency response functions are discussed in conjunction with the corresponding quantities estimated for the actual active boring bar...|$|R

40|$|Boring bar {{vibration}} in {{machine tools}} during internal turning operations is a pronounced {{problem in the}} manufacturing industry. Due to the often slender geometry of the boring bar, vibration may easily be induced by the material deformation process. One approach to overcome such vibration problems is to use active control of boring bar vibration. The design time of an active boring bar depends {{to a great extent}} on the knowledge of its dynamic properties when clamped in a lathe for different actuator positions and sizes, crucial for its performance. This thesis focuses on the development of accurate dynamic models of active boring bars with the purpose of providing qualitative information on suitable actuator position for a certain boring bar. The first part of the thesis considers the problem of building an accurate " 3 -D" finite element (FE) model of a standard boring bar used in industry. Results from experimental modal analysis of the actual boring bar are the reference. The second and the third parts discuss analytical and experimental methods for modeling the dynamic properties of a boring <b>bar</b> <b>clamped</b> in a machine tool. For this purpose, the Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories are used to produce both distributed-parameter system models and corresponding " 1 -D" FE models. A more complete " 3 -D" FE model of the system boring <b>bar</b> - <b>clamping</b> house is also developed. Spatial dynamic properties of these models are discussed and compared with adequate experimental modal analysis results from the actual boring <b>bar</b> <b>clamped</b> in a machine tool. The third part also investigates the sensitivity of the spatial dynamic properties of the derived boring bar models to variation in the structural parameters' values. The fourth part focuses on the development of a " 3 -D" FE model of the system boring bar - actuator - clamping house. Two models are discussed: a linear model and a model enabling variable contact between the clamping house and the boring bar with and without Coulomb friction in the contact surfaces. Based on these FE models fundamental bending modes and control path frequency response functions are discussed in conjunction with the corresponding quantities estimated for the actual active boring bar. In the fifth part, a method based on FE modeling and artificial neural networks for selecting a suitable actuator position inside an active boring bar is presented. Objective functions for selecting an actuator position are suggested. An active boring bar with an actuator position suggested by the method was manufactured and it displays fairly good correlation with the corresponding FE model. The final part focuses on modeling of an active boring bar vibration control system. A simple " 1 -D" FE model of a boring bar is utilized to simulate the dynamic response and an adaptive digital feedback controller realized by the feedback filtered-x LMS algorithm is used...|$|R

40|$|We address {{two aspects}} of the {{dynamics}} of the forced Duffing oscillator which are relevant to the technology of micromechanical devices and, at the same time, have intrinsic significance to the field of nonlinear oscillating systems. First, we study the stability of periodic motion when the phase shift between the external force and the oscillation is controlled -contrary to the standard case, where the control parameter is the frequency of the force. Phase-shift control is the operational configuration under which self-sustained oscillators -and, in particular, micromechanical oscillators- provide a frequency reference useful for time keeping. We show that, contrary to the standard forced Duffing oscillator, under phase-shift control oscillations are stable over the whole resonance curve. Second, we analyze a model for the internal resonance between the main Duffing oscillation mode and a higher-harmonic mode of a vibrating solid <b>bar</b> <b>clamped</b> at its two ends. We focus on the stabilization of the oscillation frequency when the resonance takes place, and present preliminary experimental results that illustrate the phenomenon. This synchronization process has been proposed to counteract the undesirable frequency-amplitude interdependence in nonlinear time-keeping micromechanical devices...|$|R
