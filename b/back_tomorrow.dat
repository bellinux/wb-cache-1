He and new {{teammate}} Rogers Hornsby (who also contributed 39 home runs) led the Cubs to their first NL pennant in eleven years.

Though trailing the Series two games to one, the Cubs were leading by a score of 8–0 in the fourth game when the Athletics mounted a 10-run rally in the seventh inning. Wilson lost two fly balls in the sun; the second, with two runners on base, led to an inside-the-park home run by Mule Haas as the Athletics won 10–8.
