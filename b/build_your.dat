This is because people search - they are information rich and time poor. It's important to capture audiences who are increasingly reading on smartphones and tablets - they click and they share. Journal articles perhaps suffer in this arena. Plus, it's really important to get ideas out there and to claim that space - especially when there is a lag between having a journal manuscript under review and the speed at which industry moves. An added benefit is that constantly thinking, writing, and sharing <b>builds</b> <b>your</b> network, and helps to improve your ability to express key points, to diverse audiences.
