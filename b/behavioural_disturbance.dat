5000|$|The main {{environmental}} concern for marine seismic surveys {{is the potential}} for noise associated with the high-energy seismic source to disturb or injure animal life, especially cetaceans such as whales, porpoises, and dolphins, as these mammals use sound as their primary method of communication with one another. [...] High-level and long-duration sound can cause physical damage, such as hearing loss, whereas lower-level noise can cause temporary threshold shifts in hearing, obscuring sounds that are vital to marine life, or <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbance.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The disease manifests {{in young}} children. Affected infants are {{apparently}} normal, although some mild facial dysmorphism may be noticeable. The stiff joints, hirsuteness and coarse hair typical of other mucopolysaccharidoses {{are usually not}} present {{until late in the}} disease. After an initial symptom-free interval, patients usually present with a slowing of development and/or behavioral problems, followed by progressive intellectual decline resulting in severe dementia and progressive motor disease. [...] Acquisition of speech is often slow and incomplete. The disease progresses to increasing <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbance</b> including temper tantrums, hyperactivity, destructiveness, aggressive behaviour, pica and sleep disturbance. As affected children have normal muscle strength and mobility, the behavioural disturbances are very difficult to manage. The disordered sleep in particular presents a significant problem to care providers. In the final phase of the illness, children become increasingly immobile and unresponsive, often require wheelchairs, and develop swallowing difficulties and seizures. The life-span of an affected child does not usually extend beyond late teens to early twenties.|$|E

40|$|The {{frequency}} of <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbances</b> early after injury {{in relation to}} outcome was prospectively investigated {{in a series of}} 67 patients with mild-to-moderate head injury (as defined by GCS on admission). In {{more than half of the}} patients, <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbances</b> were observed. Restlessness occured in 40 % of patients, whereas agitation was seen in 19 % of patients. In all patients, restlessness and agitation disappeared before resolution of PTA. In multiple regression analysis, restlessness and PTA were found to be separate factors in predicting outcome. On imaging studies, twice as many lesions were seen in patients with restlessness and agitation (81 % compared to 39 %), mainly localized in the frontotemporal region. In two thirds of patients with early <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbances,</b> residual emotional and cognitive impairments were seen 1 year after injury. This study suggests that <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbances</b> in the early phase after injury are related to frontotemporal lesions and lends support for the view of the existence of a separate profile of patient behaviour in mild-to-moderate head injury...|$|R

40|$|Expressed emotion (EE) {{represents}} {{a measure of}} the emotional quality of the relationship between a key caregiver and relative, where the latter is experiencing a psychiatric or medical condition, and with implications for the course of this condition. To the author's knowledge, despite the salience of <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbance</b> for families with learning disabled children, no published study has specifically investigated the relationship between parental EE and child <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbance.</b> The current study focused on a comparison of high and low EE households with regards to child <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbance,</b> parental stress and coping, and service and respite care usage. Forty parents were interviewed with a modified Camberwell Family Interview. The results showed no significant difference between high and low EE groups with regards to child <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbance,</b> parental coping as related to factors such as social support and familial resources, and service and respite care usage. High EE parents reported significantly higher levels of stress and significantly less use of support and advice outside the family system than low EE parents. The findings conflict with conclusions from EE research e. g. with learning disabled adolescents, dementia and non-learning disabled children, which have demonstrated a relationship between EE and <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbance,</b> but concur with studies, mainly with regards to schizophrenia, which have found that level of EE is independent of <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Thus level of EE in the current study appears principally to reflect parental characteristics as opposed to child-related characteristics. The results suggest that a focus on parental psychological needs in relation to both the emotional quality of the parent-child relationship, and the care of the child more generally, might be more appropriate for both parents and children, as opposed to a traditional child-centric service delivery. Further research is required to elucidate the relationship between EE and behaviour, and there is value in exploring the relationship between EE and behaviour over time, within a longitudinal design. Indeed, the scope for further study of EE in the area of learning disability is tremendous, and the inherent modifiability of the EE construct renders it an appealing guide in terms of service development and outcome evaluation. the Education Department of Avon County Counci...|$|E

40|$|Social {{cognition}} (SC) {{and executive}} functions were explored {{in patients with}} frontal variant frontotemporal dementia (fv-FTD) {{in order to understand}} why <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbances</b> occur in this disease. An additional purpose was the study of the structure of SC and the role of social cognition in producing effective social behavior. Twenty one patients with fv-FTD and 18 age- and education-matched healthy controls were administered neuropsychological tasks assessing aspects of SC (emotion perception and theory of mind) and executive functions. <b>Behavioural</b> <b>disturbances</b> (both positive and negative symptoms) were assessed using the Frontal Behavioural Inventory (FBI). Fv-FTD patients performed more poorly than their respective control group on theory of mind tasks. Moreover, they had difficulty perceiving the emotion of surprise and the neutral emotional state. Executive dysfunction was also evident particularly on measures of cognitive flexibility and inhibition. Deficits in SC correlated significantly with <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbances,</b> especially with positive symptoms, but not with “negative behaviours” such as apathy and indifference. Executive dysfunctions played a very crucial role in the clinical picture of fv-FTD. They correlated significantly with both negative and positive <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbances</b> and contributed significantly to the poor performance of the patients on the theory of mind tasks. Finally, concerning the structure of SC our results are suggestive of a very strong interaction between its subcomponents, namely emotion perception and theory of mind. Moreover, they indicate a very strong correlation between the cognitive subcomponent of SC (theory of mind) and executive functions. Our results highlight the role that specific aspects of SC and executive functions play in the manifestation of FTD symptoms and help to clarify the way in which <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbances</b> present early {{in the course of the}} disorder. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} missing values due to <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbances</b> on the neuropsychological test profile in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The neuropsychological examination of patients with FTD poses a methodological problem. In many patients {{it is impossible to}} administer a complete test battery, due to <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbances</b> inherent to the disease. This study describes the test behaviour of patients with FTD, the number of missing values due to disturbed test behaviour, and its influence on neuropsychological test results.  METHODS—Thirty one patients with probable FTD were administered a neuropsychological test battery including measures of memory, intelligence, and executive functioning. Moreover, patients were rated on a global deterioration scale and a test behaviour scale, constructed for this study.  RESULTS—The more disturbing the test behaviour, the less tests were assessable, leading to many missing values. The most disturbing features were "positive symptoms" of FTD, such as perseveration and stimulus boundedness. The effect of test behaviour was largest for tests measuring executive functions and reasoning capabilities. The replacement of the missing values due to <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbances</b> by the lowest score also showed the largest effect on tests of executive function and reasoning abilities.  CONCLUSION—Data imputation of missing values due to test behaviour disturbances provides a more differentiated picture of cognitive deficits in FTD. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Behavioural</b> <b>disturbances</b> in frontotemporal {{dementia}} (FTD) {{are thought to}} reflect mainly atrophy of cortical regions. Recent studies suggest that subcortical brain regions, in particular the striatum, are also significantly affected and this pathology might {{play a role in}} the generation of behavioural symptoms. Objective: To investigate prefrontal cortical and striatal atrophy contributions to behavioural symptoms in FTD. Methods: One hundred and eighty-two participants (87 FTD patients, 39 AD patients and 56 controls) were included. Behavioural profiles were established using the Cambridge Behavioural Inventory Revised (CBI-R) and Frontal System Behaviour Scale (FrSBe). Atrophy in prefrontal (VMPFC, DLPFC) and striatal (caudate, putamen) regions was established via a 5 -point visual rating scale of the MRI scans. Behavioural scores were correlated with atrophy rating scores. Results: Behavioural and atrophy ratings demonstrated that patients were significantly impaired compared to controls, with bvFTD being most severely affected. Behavioural-anatomical correlations revealed that VMPFC atrophy was closely related to abnormal behaviour and motivation disturbances. Stereotypical behaviours were associated with both VMPFC and striatal atrophy. By contrast, disturbance of eating was found to be related to striatal atrophy only. Conclusion: Frontal and striatal atrophy contributed to the <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbances</b> seen in FTD, with some behaviours related to frontal, striatal or combined fronto-striatal pathology. Consideration of striatal contributions to the generation of <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbances</b> should be taken into account when assessing patients with potential FTD...|$|R

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} The {{interconnection}} between behaviour and epilepsy {{has been recognized}} in psychiatric practice for over a century. Yet, despite this, comparatively little is known of its exact association with the epilepsies. This review highlights advances in knowledge, focusing on a broad definition of behaviour to include psychiatric pathology. Recent findings There is an expanding interest in the psychological impact of epilepsy, in particular that of affective disorder and its treatment - especially that of resective surgery. This is complemented by ongoing exploration of the psychopathology underpinning psychogenic nonepileptic attacks. Psychological treatments of epilepsy itself are coming under scrutiny and if they appear to work, this is through ameliorating psychiatric co-morbidity rather than by treating seizures. Summary Clinical practice should recognize that, {{with the possible exception}} of seizure freedom in postictal <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbance,</b> epilepsy treatment alone is unlikely to treat the associated psychological and <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Research continues to focus on assessing the correlates of epilepsy and psychopathology...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the safety and}} effectiveness of dexmedetomidine for sedating patients in whom previous attempts at sedation in the emergency department have failed. Methods: A study was carried out on dexmedetomidine for sedation of patients with acute <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbance</b> for whom at least two previous attempts at sedation with other drugs had failed. Either a loading dose of dexmedetomidine was administered or a loading dose then an infusion. Administration was titrated to the sedative effect and vital signs. The sedation assessment tool {{was used to assess}} effectiveness, and adverse effects were recorded. Effective sedation was defined as a fall in the sedation assessment tool by two levels or more for an hour or more. Results: A total of 13 patients were given dexmedetomidine. Five of the 13 had a loading dose only. Of these five, successful sedation was achieved in two, and the other three were only briefly sedated during the loading dose. One patient had hypotension. Eight patients received an infusion after the loading dose. Three were successfully sedated, but one developed hypotension. Four patients required a decrease in the infusion rate for hypotension, and in three of these the rate decrease compromised the sedation and one of these required intubation for sedation. The final patient had persistent acute <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbance,</b> which required intubation for management. Five of the eight patients developed hypotension, and, of the five, one had bradycardia and one went into atrial fibrillation. Conclusion: Intravenous dexmedetomidine for difficult-to-sedate patients with acute <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbance</b> is not safe in the emergency department setting...|$|E

40|$|Compared {{with general}} {{population}} rates, prevalence rates of ADHD have been consistently {{reported to be}} higher in {{both male and female}} offender populations, the latter estimated to range between 10 – 29 %. Research in forensic institutional settings has reported that aggressive behaviour is a particularly prominent source of impairment among men with ADHD. However there is a paucity of research investigating the type of behavioural incidents that may arise in female offenders with ADHD. This pilot study therefore aimed to further our understanding of ADHD within a cohort of female mentally disordered offenders by ascertaining estimated rates of ADHD and associated functional disturbance presenting in this population. Fifty female offenders completed the Barkley ADHD rating scales. Data on aggressive and self-harming behaviours were obtained from patients’ clinical records. Almost one-third of patients (28 %) screened positive for ADHD, most commonly hyperactive/impulsive and combined subtypes. They were significantly younger than their peers and {{there were no significant differences}} in <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbance</b> records between groups. When controlling for age, hyperactive/impulsive symptoms and combined symptoms were significantly and positively correlated with measures of <b>behavioural</b> <b>disturbance.</b> ADHD symptoms correlated more strongly with self-harm than outward aggression, which is a novel finding. This pilot study has contributed to the knowledge base about the rate and functional problems of female offenders with ADHD.
