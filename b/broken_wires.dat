40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{location}} of <b>broken</b> prestressing <b>wire</b> wraps on the overall strength of prestressed concrete cylinder pipes (PCCP) is investigated here. An advanced computational model based on non-linear finite element analysis is used to study three possible locations of <b>broken</b> <b>wire</b> wraps: at the spigot joint, at the bell joint and in {{the barrel of the}} pipe. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the cracking of the concrete core and the yielding of the prestressing wires and steel cylinder with increasing internal pressure and with an increasing number of <b>broken</b> <b>wire</b> wraps. Two classes of 2. 44 m embedded cylinder pipe (ECP) were modelled with 5, 35, 70, and 100 wire wrap breaks. The results show that <b>broken</b> <b>wire</b> wraps at the joint, and especially the spigot joint, decrease the overall strength of PCCP more so than those at the bell joint or in the barrel of the pipe. The intensity of this effect increases with increasing internal pressure and with a larger number of <b>broken</b> <b>wire</b> wraps. PublishedN/...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{prestressing}} wires of {{prestressed concrete}} cylinder pipe (PCCP) provide core concrete with compressive stress to resist internal pressure. <b>Broken</b> <b>wires</b> resulting from corrosion and embrittlement may cause cracking in pipe wall {{and increase the}} risk of failure with time. In order to reveal the mechanism of longitudinal cracking in PCCP with <b>broken</b> <b>wires,</b> a simplified model is developed and the maximum number of <b>broken</b> <b>wires</b> to preclude onset of longitudinal cracking can be determined conveniently by the equations derived in this paper. Verification against results of finite element analysis shows that the presented method has decent accuracy for appropriate effective pipe length and wall thickness. By comparing the calculated maximum number of <b>broken</b> <b>wires</b> with the actual number of <b>broken</b> <b>wires</b> detected by inspection and monitoring technologies, longitudinal cracking in prestress loss zone can be predicted, thus aiding condition assessment of PCCP...|$|E

40|$|Current {{methods of}} {{inspecting}} wire rope for <b>broken</b> <b>wires</b> or excessive wear include visual inspection, physical measurements of rope diameter, and electromagnetic nondestructive testing (NDT).

Electromagnetic NDT enables {{a more thorough}} assessment of the condition of a wire rope, but the repeatability, accuracy, and objectivity of this method can be improved. One means of achieving this goal {{is to use a}} computer to analyze the test data and determine the condition of the wire rope, including the presence of <b>broken</b> <b>wires</b> and corrosion, and the amount of wear. An off-the-shelf data acquisition and analysis system was tested in a U. S. Bureau of Mines laboratory using a continuous loop of wire rope containing fabricated flaws. The test rope was run through a commercially available NDT instrument.

Firstly 5000 N axial tension was placed on the rope, the stress distribution was simulated and analysed, and the steel wire with the largest stress distribution was found out. Then one steel wire was truncated with the load unchanged, and the finite element simulation was carried out again, and repeated the steps several times.

40|$|Safety of {{suspension}} {{bridges and}} stay-cable bridges is {{depending on the}} durability of the cables. The latter show an apparent healthy aspect over their observable lengths but in fact can be damaged in the hidden parts (anchorages). In this study, Acoustic Emission (AE) is used in order to detect and to locate <b>broken</b> <b>wires</b> in the anchorages areas. The acoustic activity {{in the presence of}} <b>broken</b> <b>wires</b> comes from interwire friction. When damaged, the reference cables are put in vibration and some acoustic parameters can be used to highlight difference between them. The main parameters of the acoustic signals are the total number of count and the cumulated energy. To better understand the interwire fretting mechanism, a study of the behaviour of a broken wire in a tight cable subject to dynamic bending has been carried out. This contributes to define the conditions of vibrating for AE detection. The interwire fretting mechanism and its detection are influenced by the change of roughness, lubrication and interwire contact strength.
