500|$|In an {{interview}} with Shave Magazine, Ben Gibbard commented on his song writing saying that he [...] "never sit down to write an album number one. I just kind of sit down and write songs and the theme kind of makes itself apparent. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> say I was writing about searching for something as much as just trying to document with every song where I am in that moment when I’m writing that song. If a theme kind of makes itself apparent in a record, it {{has more to do}} with the fact that just what’s been on my mind recently. So I guess clearly I have been and was and am, but it was never a conscious decision." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1941, Presley entered {{first grade}} at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his {{instructors}} regarded him as [...] "average". He {{was encouraged to}} enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of Red Foley's country song [...] "Old Shep" [...] during morning prayers. The contest, held at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, was his first public performance. Ten-year-old Presley was dressed as a cowboy; he stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang [...] "Old Shep". He recalled placing fifth. A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something else—by different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle. Over the following year, he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, [...] "I took the guitar, and I watched people, and I learned {{to play a little}} bit. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> sing in public. I was very shy about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Tuesday, April 17, 2007, the {{day after}} the Virginia Tech massacre, in which a student named Seung-Hui Cho used guns to kill 32 {{students}} and professors before committing suicide, while contestant Chris Richardson and Ryan Seacrest were discussing the shooting after Chris's critique, Simon Cowell apparently appeared to be rolling his eyes at the incident, when he was actually speaking to Paula Abdul and did not hear what Chris had said. On the results show the next day, Cowell stated: [...] "I may not be the nicest person in the world, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never,</b> ever, ever, disrespect those families or those victims, and I felt it was important to set the record straight." [...] To clear Cowell's name, a video was shown on the result show which showed Cowell and Abdul talking with an inset of Chris and Seacrest discussing the shooting. Also, Seacrest began the performance show by acknowledging what had happened the day before.|$|E

2500|$|On March 9, {{during a}} segment of Mad Money, Cramer admitted, [...] "OK, I'm a tempting target. Plenty of people come in and give their {{criticism}} on this show. But we're dealing with serious issues here; we need solutions, which I offer almost every night. I don't want ad hominem attacks. Take The New York Times columnist Frank Rich and Jon Stewart; I criticize Obama, so both of them seize on the urban legend that I recommended Bear Stearns the week before it collapsed, when I simply told an e-mailer that the deposit in his account at Bear Stearns was safe. 'Your money is safe in Bear Stearns,'" [...] Cramer repeated, referring to his own quote during a March 11, 2008 segment of Mad Money. Moreover, Cramer outlined, [...] "But through a clever sound bite, Stewart, and subsequently Rich—neither of whom have bothered {{to listen to the}} context of the pulled quote—pass off the notion of account safety as an out-and-out buy recommendation. If you called Mad Money and asked me about Citigroup, I would tell you that the common stock might be worthless, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> tell you to pull your money out of the bank because I was worried about its solvency. Your money is safe in Citi as I said it was in Bear. The fact that I was right rankles me even more." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] she {{answered}} reflectively. [...] "I can shoot {{very well with}} a rifle, for my father has taught me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> shoot at living things unless I must because I was hungry, for I think that to kill is cruel.

60|$|As to {{explaining}} my ejaculations, {{that was}} impossible. I thought the matter {{over and over}} again as I lay awake that night, and I determined that I would never tell Madeline the facts of the case. It would be better for me to suffer all my life than for her to know that the ghost of her uncle haunted the house. Mr. Hinckman was away, and if she knew of his ghost she could not be made to believe that he was not dead. She might not survive the shock! No, my heart could bleed, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> tell her.|$|E
6000|$|On {{my way out}} of this amphitheater a hard wind {{swooped down}} over the slopes, tearing up the colored dust in sheets and clouds. It seemed to me each gully had its mystic pall of color.

500|$|Moynahan {{moved to}} New York at age 18 and, a year later, began {{appearing}} in magazines such as Vogue and Elle, and on covers of other widely-known magazines. Her cover highlights include Vogue Paris (May 1993), Elle (October 1993), and Glamour (six times). In an interview given in July 2004, Moynahan, discussing her early work, said: [...] "It was a crazy world that {{paid a lot}} of money.

60|$|Anyway, {{most of my}} boys took {{to going}} to church and Bible class of their own accord, after I'd been their aunt for awhile. The young {{minister}} {{thought it was all}} his doings, and I let him think so to keep him cheered up. He was a nice boy himself, and often dropped in of an evening too; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> let him talk theology until after supper.

Dear Elizabeth was wont to plead for him before she died, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> listen to her. I was hearty and strong then, and my heart was hard.

Sickness teaches us that we must condone, and not condemn. He has lived a reputable life, and made the most of the little start I gave him. He has {{supported}} his Majesty and my Lord in most trying times. And his Excellency tells me that the coming governor, Eden, will surely reward him with a seat in the Council." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never dreamed}} of this," [...] she said at last, when he ceased. [...] "I cannot remember, now, that I ever asked him, but I {{took it for granted}} that he would like nothing better than to follow in his father's steps. Had I known that he objected to it, I would not for a moment have forced him against his inclinations. Of course it is natural that, being alone in the world, I should like to have him with me still, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have been so selfish as to have sacrificed his life to mine. Still, though {{it would be hard to}} have parted from him in any way, it is harder still to part like this. If he was to go, he need not have gone as a common sailor. The squire, who has done so much for him, would no doubt, instead of sending him to school, have {{obtained}} a midshipman's berth for him, or a commission in the army; but it is dreadful to think of him as a common sailor, liable to be flogged." ...|$|E

5000|$|To her dismay, her Hillbillies co-star Buddy Ebsen {{contacted}} the Shuster campaign and volunteered {{to make a}} radio campaign ad in which he called Kulp [...] "too liberal."

60|$|Of course {{one does}} not become a soldier on active service at once for the wishing, {{and there was not}} at first that ready {{disposition}} {{on the part of the}} home military authorities which arose later, to send out young enthusiasts. I could ride and shoot fairly well, and accordingly I decided to go on my own account to Durban--for it was manifest that things would begin in Natal--and there attach myself to some of the local volunteer corps that would certainly be raised. This took me out of England at once, a thing that fell in very well with my mood. <b>I</b> <b>would,</b> <b>I</b> was resolved, begin life afresh. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> force myself to think of nothing <b>but</b> the war. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> if <b>I</b> could help it think of Mary again.|$|R
