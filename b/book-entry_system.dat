40|$|The {{conversion}} of U. S. Treasury securities from physical to book-entry form {{was a major}} event {{in the history of}} the Treasury market. The conversion, which began in 1966, resulted in an automated system that has greatly reduced market operating costs and risks. This article examines the origins and development of the Federal Reserve <b>book-entry</b> <b>system</b> for Treasury securities. It suggests that the system was the product of three important factors: the interest of the Federal Reserve Banks and the Treasury in lowering their operating costs and risks, the intention of the Reserve Banks and the Treasury to preserve the liquidity of the market, and the desire of the Reserve Banks to reduce member bank operating costs. Two critical incidents-a loss of securities at a Reserve Bank in 1962 and an "insurance crisis" in 1970 - 71 -played major roles in the early development and subsequent expansion of the <b>book-entry</b> <b>system.</b> Treasury bonds; Federal Reserve banks - Automation; Government securities; Federal Reserve banks - Costs...|$|E
5000|$|Adoption of <b>book-entry</b> <b>systems</b> among private {{companies}} has lagged adoption among public companies, public company transfer agents, and broker-dealers. [...] This {{may be due}} to a number of misunderstandings and challenges unique to private company security issuance but, regardless, data suggest adoption of <b>book-entry</b> <b>systems</b> among {{private companies}} is growing rapidly.|$|R
50|$|Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code {{provides}} for a standard settlement procedure for securities transfers to be effected by book entry when the underlying securities are registered {{in the name of}} the designated nominee of a securities intermediary. Article 8 also {{provides for}} multiple <b>book-entry</b> <b>systems</b> to act together to form a heavily-intermediated securities holding chain known as an Indirect holding system.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{phenomenon}} is ancient, since book entry systems for recording securities have been noted from civilisations as early as Assyria in 2000 BC, it gained new prominence {{with the advent of}} computer technology in the late 20th century. Even during the period when paper certificates were popular, <b>book-entry</b> <b>systems</b> continued since many small firms could not afford printing secured paper-form securities. These book-entry securities were often held under the control of an attorney who acts as a notary to certify the existence of the securities, as well as their authenticity.|$|R
50|$|On August 8, 2006, the SEC {{approved}} a rule changed by NASDAQ, NYSE and AMEX requiring all listed securities (except certain debt securities) {{to be eligible}} for a direct registration system ("DRS") as of March 31, 2008. DRS is an entirely electronic <b>book-entry</b> style <b>system</b> that does not involve physical stock certificates. The rule change does not eliminate physical certificates, but requires issuers {{to be eligible for}} entirely electronic recording of securities ownership.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1990s, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) {{working with}} the {{securities}} industry, developed a new form of, [...] "direct holding system" [...] that would allow both the speedy settlement of securities transactions and communication between shareholders and their companies. This new system was a type of <b>book-entry</b> direct registration <b>system</b> (DRS) operated by stock transfer agent. This concept would allow any retail investor who wants his or her securities to be registered directly on the books of the issuer, but does not necessarily want to receive a certificate, to register those securities in book-entry form directly on the books of the issuer. The DRS concept {{has been slow to}} develop for two reasons. First, many investors do not understand that if they give up paper certificates while joining a DRS, this will return them to the status of direct shareholders of the issuer rather than just customers of a broker (who is the registered shareholder {{in the eyes of the}} issuer), and second, once brokers and banks had been inserted as the [...] "indispensable" [...] middlemen between shareholders and issuers, they were not eager to surrender this privileged position of control. As a result, one version of the [...] "direct holding system" [...] is an inefficient relic of the past and a modern DRS form of direct holding remains for most shareholders an unrealized thing of the future.|$|R
