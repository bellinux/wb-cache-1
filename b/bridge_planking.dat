500|$|Lord Dunmore had, {{on arrival}} in Norfolk, ordered the {{fortification}} {{of the bridge}} across the Elizabeth River, about [...] south of Norfolk {{in the village of}} Great Bridge. [...] The bridge formed a natural defense point since it was on the only road leading south from Norfolk toward North Carolina, it was bordered on both sides by the Great Dismal Swamp, and the access to the bridge on both sides was via narrow causeways. [...] Dunmore sent 25 men of the 14th Foot to the bridge, where they erected a small stockade fort they called Fort Murray on the Norfolk side of the bridge. [...] They also removed the <b>bridge</b> <b>planking</b> to make crossing it more difficult. [...] The fort was armed with two cannons and several smaller swivel guns. [...] The men of the 14th were augmented by small companies from the Ethiopian and Queen's Own regiments, bringing the garrison size to between 40 and 80 men.|$|E
500|$|Dunmore's best {{intelligence}} {{had informed}} him that the rebel forces numbered about 400.

[...] They had been dispatched on a routine deployment to another nearby crossing, and Dunmore had failed to send orders ensuring their availability for the operation. [...] Leslie decided to proceed with the attack anyway. [...] After resting his troops until a little before dawn, he sent men out to replace the <b>bridge</b> <b>planking.</b> [...] Once this was finished, Captain Charles Fordyce led a company of 60 grenadiers across the bridge. [...] They briefly skirmished with militia sentries, raising the alarm in the camp beyond the entrenchments. [...] Fordyce's men were then joined by a company of navy gunners who had been brought along to operate the field artillery for the attack, while the Tory companies arrayed themselves on the Norfolk side of the bridge.|$|E

500|$|As the British forces {{advanced}} on the American line, Phillips and Abercrombie {{noticed that}} one enterprising company of Virginia militia {{had established a}} position on a hill that provided them with an excellent opportunity to enfilade the British line. [...] Abercrombie sent the jägers to flush them out. [...] The lines then closed, and the action became general. [...] The first line of militia put up stiffer resistance than the British anticipated. [...] The British artillery, {{and the strength of}} numbers that threatened to flank their position convinced the first militia line to retreat to the second after half an hour of resistance. [...] Phillips also detached Simcoe and his rangers on a lengthy and roundabout flanking maneuver intended to prevent the Americans from retreating across the Pocahontas Bridge. [...] While Simcoe moved, Phillips made two assaults on the second militia line, both of which were repulsed. [...] It was not until the British artillery was in position to rake the American line more than an hour later that von Steuben finally ordered the retreat. [...] The Americans were eventually able to make an orderly retreat across the bridge, covered by the men placed on the high ground above {{the far side of the}} bridge. [...] The last companies across took up the <b>bridge</b> <b>planking</b> as they went, in order to delay pursuit (an act which later earned them the praise of contemporaries such as Thomas Jefferson, General Nathanael Greene, and others).|$|E

5000|$|In the mid-1880s {{major change}} came to New Canton when a {{railroad}} bridge was constructed over the James River, connecting the Bremo Bluff {{side to the}} New Canton side.

50|$|On 17 April, the Titania began loading {{supplies}} and {{equipment for the}} Australian 26th Infantry Brigade (Reinforced). She got underway on 27 April for the assault on Tarakan Island and arrived off Yellow Beach on P-day, 1 May. The Titanias first shore parties discovered soft, sticky, mud beaches and a 10-foot tidal range, both of which slowed and hampered unloading efforts. Finding the pier badly burned but its supporting structure intact, the Titania sent a work party ashore to obtain logs to restore the pier to usable condition. Seventy tons of <b>bridge</b> <b>planking</b> from the transport's hold completed the repair job and {{made it possible for}} trucks to load from the pier at four hatches. Under these improved conditions, the Titania discharged the materials, engineering equipment, and supplies needed to construct and operate an airfield at Tarakan by the 9th. She retired toward Morotai that day, and then she remained at anchor there {{throughout the rest of the}} month.|$|E

5000|$|Pass With Care: A pair of {{platforms}} {{are suspended}} 20 feet above water, connected by an unstable rope <b>bridge</b> with crooked <b>planks.</b> Unlike {{the previous two}} challenge games, this challenge is played with guys and girls partnered together. Each partner starts {{on opposite sides of}} the ropes, and have to meet each other halfway through the bridge on a red plank. The catch: A team is disqualified if one player sits, kneels on, or touches any part of the bridge with their hands, or falls off the unstable bridge. Since nobody made it across the bridge on the first go-around, the challenge was repeated in a second round, in which teams were allowed to make it across the bridge by any means possible, including sitting on, crawling and kneeling on the <b>bridge</b> <b>planks.</b> The team that makes it across the bridge in the fastest time wins, with the male partner safe from Duel selection and the female partner winning a prize.|$|R
