40|$|An osteochondrosarcoma of {{the common}} fowl, {{designated}} in this laboratory as Chicken Tumor VII, has been successfully transplanted to seven successive series of hosts. The original growth contained bone and cartilage, {{was attached to the}} sternal keel of an otherwise healthy chicken, and appeared to have arisen from this structure. In the growths derived from its transplantation cartilage is regularly laid down, followed later by bone in case the host lives long enough. The prechondral tissue consists of spindle-shaped or multipolar cells of the fibroblast type. The histological character and the behavior of this prechondral tissue show that it is sarcomatous, a fact further proven by one recent case in which the tumor has metastasized. The secondary growth in this instance consisted of prechondral tissue in which a cartilaginous change was taking place. The tumor could not be transferred to pigeons, the one foreign species tested, but grew readily in chickens of two alien breeds. Reinoculation experiments suggest the occurrence of a natural, individual immunity, and of a certain degree of acquired resistance. In one fowl visceral growths developed following an intravenous injection of tumor emulsion, although whether they were due to this cause or were secondary to the large implantation growths in the muscles is uncertain.

40|$|In a {{previous}} communication (1), a description was given of an organism which {{was obtained from}} a stock culture of human tubercle bacilli, Strain H- 37. This organism had the morphological characteristics of the parent strain but its growth was more rapid, and it was chromogenic, having acquired a deep yellow-orange color. On media suitable to acid-fast growth, colonies of this organism were made up of non-acid-fast rods with a scattering of acid-fast granules and rods. On more simple media, the acid-fast elements were almost entirely absent. This organism caused tuberculosis in three of five guinea pigs. It {{was assumed to be}} a non-acid-fast type of B. tuberculosis and was named the chromogenic H- 37 strain. The work represented in the present communication was done in order to determine whether there existed in association with the chromogenic H- 37 strain an agent causing the loss of acid-fastness and, if this agent was transferable, to use it in degrading acid-fast organisms into non-acid-fast forms.

Efforts were next made to determine whether a filtrable virus is responsible for the disease. Method In the filtration experiments, 23 inch Berkefeld V and N candles and Seitz discs have been used. The Berkefeld candles were given a preliminary test of their ability to retain bacteria by the filtration of a young (6 to 24 hour) broth culture of a chromogenic strain of B. prodigiosus. A like test was made at each filtration. To determine whether B. prodigiosus or other bacteria were present, two or more blood or plain agar slants were inoculated with 1 loopful of the unfiltered suspensions and other tubes of the same culture media with 0. 5 to 2 cc. of the filtrates. In addition when the suspension was in broth a portion of the filtrate was incubated and examined for growth. The cultures were not discarded until they had been incubated at least 10 days. In all instances the media inoculated with unfiltered material yielded a profuse growth of B. prodigiosus whereas the media inoculated with filtrates remained sterile. The comparative porosity of the <b>Berkefeld</b> <b>filters</b> was determined by the waterflow test of Ward and Tang (2) by which measurement was made of the amount of water that will flow through them in 5 minutes at 10 cm. negative pressure.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the mode of action of leucemie plasma is different from that of leucemic cells. Although inoculum containing leucemic cells (whole blood and cell suspensions) also conrains some of the filterable transmitting agent, the leucemic ceils are themselves capable of multiplication in susceptible hosts, like cells of transplantable tumors (1). On the other hand, leucemic plasma transmits leucosis only because it contains the agent which causes neoplastic transformation of some of the bone marrow elements of susceptible hosts. This agent is present in the plasma in very high concentration (2). Its properties in general, and particularly its filterability, are best studied with this material, which can easily be obtained free from ceils and cellular debris.

40|$|The {{fact that}} the coagulative {{principle}} is {{closely associated with the}} euglobulin fraction of the blood is of clinical as well as of theoretical interest. It enables us to prepare a hemostatic containing about 2 per cent of protein which is more potent than the whole serum containing 6 to 7 per cent of protein. A preparation of this kind has been made in this laboratory from horse serum and employed during the past few months in numerous cases of bleeding. This euglobulin is absolutely sterile, as it has been passed through a <b>Berkefeld</b> <b>filter,</b> and is safeguarded against decomposition by the addition of 0. 3 per cent tricresol. A detailed account of the therapeutic use of euglobulin will be reported elsewhere. It may be stated, however, that it has been employed in the various manifestations of intractable hemorrhage in which horse serum has been so largely resorted to of late years, and that in certain cases has seemed to bring about most satisfactory results; in no instance has there been any untoward effect. When intravenous injections are resorted to, euglobulin seems to be preferable to serum which contains fully three times the quantity of protein. It also seems to be absorbed more quickly from the subcutaneous tissues. In all probability it will be found to meet the same indications as whole serum, possessing the advantages of concentration, and necessitating the introduction into the body of a much smaller amount of foreign protein...|$|E
40|$|That {{the result}} of any {{filtration}} experiment is dependent {{on a number of}} different factors, that these factors must be carefully controlled and the exact conditions under which any such experi-ment is carried out accurately set forth is now well recognized, and has been thoroughly discussed and well summarized by Mudd (1928). Mudd (1922) and Kramer (1928) have shown that the passage of any substance through a filter depends not only on the relation {{of the size of the}} particles in suspension to the size of the pores of the filter, but also upon the relation of the electrical charge on the filter to the electrical charge on the suspended particles. Thus any siliceous filter, such as the Berkefeld, Chamberland or Mandler, carrying a negative charge, will allow the passage of the acidic dye, Congo red, but will hold back basic Victoria blue B. That the preliminary passage through a filter of egg white, peptone, heated serum or oil allows the subsequent passage of substances which are ordinarily held back has been demonstrated by Holderer (1912), Muir and Browning (1908 - 1909) and Holman (1926). Bronfenbrenner (1927) found that if particles carrying bac-teriophage were deposited on a <b>Berkefeld</b> <b>filter,</b> the bacteriophage could be washed through the filter with broth, but not with water.

40|$|The recent {{investigations}} of Patek and Stet-son (1) 2 {{indicate that the}} defect in coagulation of blood in hemophilia resides in the plasma {{rather than in the}} platelets. Patek and Taylor (2, 3) 2 isolated a substance from citrated normal cellular-free plasma, by isoelectric precipitation, with which was associated the clot-promoting factor of normal plasma. This substance was effective, both in vitro and after intravenous injection, in reducing the coagulation time of hemophilic blood. By the same method, a similar substance in approximately the same quantity was obtained from citrated hemophilic plasma, but its clot-accelerating power on hemophilic blood was much less marked. In the absence of definite knowl-edge concerning the nature of the effective mate-rial it was called "globulin substance " which is the nomenclature that will be retained in this communication. The material was thermolabile, insoluble in water, partially soluble in physiologi-cal saline solution, and non-diffusible. It was precipitated in optimal amounts between pH 5. 9 and 6. 4. The material passed readily through a <b>Berkefeld</b> <b>filter</b> without loss of potency and was almost completely inactivated by small excesses of alkali (3). Bendien and Creveld (4) have iso-lated a substance, by dilution and acidification, from normal serum which they injected intra-muscularly and intravenously and report favor-able results.

40|$|One of the {{important}} factors conditioning the suitability of a habitat {{for the development of}} mosquito larva is the available food supply. Chiefly for this reason, a number of investigators (see Hinman, 1930, for a summary of the literature) have studied the food requirements of mosquito 1 arva@. Since these insects usually ingest large amounts of particulate matter, it has been commonly concluded that this material is the principal, if not the only, source @f food. However, in 1907, Putter had shown that the chief food source for some aquatic organisms consists of organic colloids and solutes, and Matheson and Hinman (1930) suggested that such was probably the case with mosquito larvae. Hinman (1930) presented evidence in support of this suggestion. He was able to rear small numbers of sterile) Edes cegypti in water very rich in organic matter that had been <b>filtered</b> through a <b>Berkefeld</b> N <b>filter.</b> Later (Hinman, 1932) he found that anopheline larwe, in Berkefeld filtrates of the water of their natural habitat, could survive about 11 days and that some reached the second instar. If such water was sub jected to dialysis against distilled water, and the dialysate sterilized by Berkefeld filtration, a medium was obtained containing only the solutes of the original water. In such a medium, sterile anopheline larvae died within 3 days without reaching the second instar. Shipitsina (1930) obtained results similar to those of Hinman. In <b>Berkefeld</b> <b>filtered</b> water, anopheline larwe made a slight growth, some reaching the second instar. She concluded that while organic colloids play some part in the nutrition of the larwe, by far the larger role must l) e attributed to particulate matter.

40|$|In 1910, Peyton Rous {{identified}} a transmissible avian tumor virus, a discovery that began {{the journey from}} tumor virus biology to tumor biology itself. Peyton Rous loved wild flowers. A selfproclaimed disciple of Carl Linnaeus, he published a short-lived column in the Baltimore Sun {{at the age of}} eighteen called “Wild Flowers of the Month. ” With that column, however, his career as a nature writer began and ended. But botany’s loss was cancer biology’s gain. Lessons from the Plymouth Rock hen In 1909, fresh out of medical school and with only 2 years of research under his belt, Rous joined the staff of the Rockefeller Institute and was promptly put in charge of the laboratory for cancer research. Soon thereafter, he was given a barred Plymouth Rock hen that had a large tumor growing on its breast. Recent descriptions of unusual transmissible growths in various animals had sparked his attention, so Rous attempted to transfer his chicken’s tumor. When he injected small pieces of the growth into hens from the same bloodline, but not chickens of other varieties or birds of other species, they too developed tumors (1). Although avian cancers were by no means a new discovery at that time—fibromas, myomas, carcinomas, and sarcomas had all been described in birds—they had never been successfully transmitted from one bird to another. Close examination of Rous ’ tumor revealed a spindle-cell sarcoma that looked like a classical neoplasm except that, unlike most neoplasms described at that time, it was transmissible. Rous later found that adoptive tumor formation did not require transfer of intact tumor cells, and could be achieved using cell-free filtrates that passed through a <b>Berkefeld</b> <b>filter</b> (to exclude bacteria) or supernatants from emulsified tumor cells (2). He thus concluded that the tumors were caused by a filterable agent, as viruses were then known. He published these findings in a pair of seminal articles in th...|$|E
40|$|We have {{described}} the cultivation of a minute organism, upon the special media devised by Noguchi for growing spirochetal organisms, that gives rise to pyrexial and leucocytic reactions in the guinea pig. The reaction in the animal following the injection of culture filtrate is identical with that induced by the inoculation of human dengue blood. While it is possible, it is hardly probable that the infection of animals with cultures of this microorganism several generations removed from the original {{is due to a}} mechanically transferred virus with which the visible microorganism cultivated became accidentally associated. Furthermore, it is unlikely that such a virus would remain viable and be carried over to subcultures in sufficient numbers to infect the animal. The microorganisms appear in culture as globoid bodies measuring from 0. 1 to 0. 3 µ in diameter and are arranged singly, in pairs, and in short chains. They readily pass through the <b>Berkefeld</b> <b>filter</b> (N and V) and the filtrate gives rise to a characteristic reaction in the inoculated guinea pig. The filtrate yields in subplants the same globoid bodies of the original culture. Initial cultures have been obtained directly from the blood of the human case {{as well as from the}} blood of guinea pigs reacting to the human material. However, only early generations retain the degree of virulence necessary to cause the experimental reaction, the culture of remote generation failing to infect. As far as known this minute organism has characters in common with the globoid bodies of Flexner and Noguchi obtained from cases of poliomyelitis. In plasma semisolid medium the striking feature indicative of growth is colonization, which in itself serves to differentiate the opalescence of the medium occasioned by disintegration of the contained tissue. As regards the presence of spirochetal organisms in the blood of dengue fever, we may state that examination was made of the material from human cases and from. a large number of inoculated animals. Despite the most careful search with the dark-field microscope and repeated examinations of blood specimens stained by the best methods, we have been unable to find any demonstrable spiral organism in the blood of dengue patients or in the experimentally inoculated animal. The minute organism herein described is frequently present in cultures of the blood of human dengue and of animals inoculated with dengue material. The inoculation of the culture into guinea pigs produces a response comparable to that occurring in the human case, and that induced by the injection of human dengue blood in guinea pigs. While we are of the opinion that the anaerobic globular bodies described may bear etiological relationship to dengue, we realize that further proof and confirmation of our work are required to establish the connection...|$|E
40|$|The poliomyelitic virus {{obtained}} from an experimental monkey {{has been passed}} through eight generations in rabbits. It {{shows no signs of}} dying out. On the other hand, it gives no evidence of becoming more pathogenic to the species through successive passage. The period of incubation remains variable and the percentage of takes has not increased. Whether eventually a virus can be obtained which is of heightened virulence to rabbits is problematic. All inoculations are by no means successful. The animals show great individual differences in susceptibility to the virus, as is evidenced by the fact that out of fifty-four rabbits inoculated, only twenty-two, or about 40 per cent, succumbed. This fact may explain the negative results of other investigators. At several points in the series of experiments it was thought that the strain had died out. As many as six rabbits have been inoculated one after the other before the virus would catch again. The age of the rabbits is important in considering the susceptibility. From the limited data at our command, adult rabbits are resistant, and there appears to be an abrupt increase in resistance between the age of 6 and 8 weeks; that is, rabbits under 6 weeks are more susceptible to the virus. There seems to be a parallel between the age incidence of this disease in rabbits and spontaneous poliomyelitis in man. The age incidence of poliomyelitis in man is indicated by the term "infantile paralysis. " Several methods of inoculation have proved successful; thus the rabbits have succumbed as a result of introducing the virus directly into the brain, by injecting it into a peripheral nerve, or directly into the circulation, or by placing it upon the uninjured nasal mucosa. The symptoms produced show more or less departure from the symptoms of poliomyelitis as seen in the spontaneous disease in man and in the experimental disease in the monkey. There are two distinct pictures recognizable. In one there is paralysis of {{one or more of the}} extremities which progresses until death, resembling somewhat the symptoms of the experimental disease in the monkey. This we have designated the progressive type. The other group is included in what we have called the fulminating type. The symptoms are explosive in character, with extreme weakness amounting to prostration, terminating in death in a few hours, attendant upon respiratory failure. The mode of inoculation seems to have little effect upon the type of symptoms produced. The period of incubation is variable and apparently does not depend upon the method of inoculation. The period varied from 2 to 41 days, with an average of 12 days. The two extremes both occurred after intracranial injection. After intranasal insufflation the incubation period was short, being in each case 2 days, followed by symptoms of the fulminating type. The placing of the virus into the nose seems to be an effective method, but is as uncertain as other routes, as only three out of nine rabbits tested in this manner succumbed. The disease produced by this route was particularly virulent. The virus shows no tendency to become fixed. The period of incubation is as variable in the eighth generation as in the first, and the virus has shown no tendency towards increasing virulence through successive passage, in these respects differing from the virus of rabies. We have found the virus to be filterable. An emulsion of the central nervous matter of a rabbit of the first generation passed through a <b>Berkefeld</b> <b>filter,</b> and injected intracerebrally into another rabbit, resulted in death, preceded by symptoms of the fulminating type. Virus (unfiltered) from this rabbit was transferred successfully to two other rabbits. The lesions, while definite and consistent throughout the series, lack the distinctive features of the pathologic picture of poliomyelitis in man and the monkey. Capillary congestion, punctate hemorrhages, degeneration of the motor cells, satellitosis, and more or less cellular infiltration of the gray matter of the cord and medulla are found, but perivascular infiltration is absent and the infiltrating cells are not lymphocytic in character. One of the most striking features of this investigation is the way in which rabbits and monkeys react to the same virus. The disease in the rabbit presents certain clinical resemblances to the experimental disease in the monkey and also to the spontaneous disease in children. On the other hand, the symptoms show marked variation from those seen in the monkey and in man. The picture has not the same constancy in rabbits and could not in most cases be recognized clinically as poliomyelitis. There are still more marked differences in the pathology. While it is true that the brunt of the attack in the rabbit falls upon the gray matter of the cord and medulla, the appearance of the lesions under the microscope shows such differences from the lesions of experimental poliomyelitis in monkeys, as well as the natural disease in man, as to suggest two distinct infections. It is more reasonable, however, to assume that we are dealing with a modified form of poliomyelitis; that the rabbit reacts differently to the virus than the monkey or man; and that the disease produced in rabbits by us and others is in fact poliomyelitis. So far as we know, no other virus produces such differences in two animal species. Smallpox is so profoundly altered in the cow that it took almost 100 years to prove Jenner's assumption that cowpox is a modified form of smallpox. However, the pock of vaccinia is a correct counterpart both clinically and pathologically of the pock of variola. If the virus of poliomyelitis may be so altered in the rabbit as scarcely to be recognizable, may it not be still more profoundly changed in other animals? The conjecture then arises that poliomyelitis, instead of being limited naturally to man and experimentally to monkeys, may in fact occur in other animals in unnoticed or unrecognized form. If this should prove true, it may be a source of human infection and may help to solve the problem of prevention...|$|E

In this procedure, as in all other manipulations incident to their preparation, the extracts should be protected {{as far as possible}} from contact with air. All extracts were proved sterile by cultural and animal tests. Sterile extracts of unwashed pneumococcus cells promptly form peroxide on exposure to air. Peroxide formation is almost as active in extracts aerated at 2 °C. as in those exposed to the air at room temperature. Detectable amounts of peroxide may be produced by these cell extracts within the reaction range of pH 5 to 9, the optimal zone lying at reactions less acid than pH 6. The peroxide-forming activity of the extracts is gradually diminished by prolonged exposure to 55 °C., and is completely destroyed by heating at 65 °C. for 5 minutes. Cell extracts of pneumococci which have been thoroughly washed prior to extraction in salt or phosphate solutions exhibit no peroxide-forming activity. These extracts of washed cells may be activated by the addition of the cell washings, yeast extract, or muscle infusion...|$|R
40|$|Regarding {{the cause}} of {{clinical}} manifestations and death in high intestinal obstruction, many recent investigations have presented much evidence {{in favor of the}} hypothesis that the absorption of toxins from the obstructed portion of the intestine into the systemic circulation results in profound intoxication and leads to death. Various chemical substances have been suggested as being responsible for the toxemia. Nesbitt found cholin and neurin in the intestinal contents above an occlusion in the small intestine of a dog after feeding yolk of egg, and he believed that the neurin was a lethal factor. Kukula obtained from the obstructed intestine a toxic substance which was extractible with amyl alcohol, and more or less removable by <b>Berkefeld</b> <b>filters.</b> Albeck believed {{that it was one of}} the group of putrefactive poisons. Murphy and Brooks thought that the toxin was similar to the sepsin isolated by Faust. Roger and Gamier obtained a toxic substance from the contents of the obstructed small intestine of rabbits and dogs by precipitation with alcohol and extraction of the pre-cipitate with water. They noted that part of the toxicity re-mained in the alcoholic filtrate. G. H. Whipple and his col-laborators, by a similar but slightly modified procedure, obtained a toxic substance of a heteroproteose nature which they re-garded as an essential poison concerned in the intoxication of intestinal obstruction in dogs. Sweet, Peet and Hendrix found in the fluid of the intestinal loops a proteose and a cholin-like substance...|$|R
40|$|A {{microorganism}} {{cultivated in}} the course of experiments with the virus of hog cholera shows the following points of interest. It is pleomorphic in extreme degree. Among the forms are coccoid and bacillary bodies at the lower limits of visibility. The culture can be completely regenerated after filtration through some <b>Berkefeld</b> N <b>filters</b> although these retain Bacillus abortus (Bang). The culture is carried forward by multiplication of forms of easy visibility (1. 5 µ). Associated with these at times are still larger forms bearing a striking general resemblance to those yeasts which develop abortive mycelia. Motile bacillary forms appear to arise as buds or branches from round or ovoid cocci. While cognizance is taken of possible alternatives the microorganism is provisionally classified with the yeasts and recognizing its filterability is named Schizosaccharomyces filtrans.

40|$|By the {{employment}} of methods designed to promote the growth both of aerobic and anaerobic organisms, particularly those belonging to the class of spirochetes, {{it was possible to}} obtain a pure culture of a delicate organism, the morphological features of which place it in the genus Leptospira. On three occasions, that is, from three out of eleven cases of yellow fever, the organism was directly cultivated. These three strains were found to induce the characteristic symptoms and lesions when tested on guinea pigs. The organism was designated Leptospira icteroides. Leptospira icteroides was also obtained in pure culture from the blood of guinea pigs which succumbed to infection after being inoculated with the blood or organ emulsions from patients suffering from yellow fever. These cultures also proved to be virulent when tested on susceptible animals. The morphological characteristics and certain biological properties of the organism were considered in detail. It is invisible under translucent illumination and is difficult to stain by most aniline dyes. It is highly sensitive to the presence of bacteria and is rapidly destroyed in a medium in which certain other organisms are present. The presence of blood serum (man, sheep, horse, rabbit, etc.) seems to be essential for its growth. It grows well at a temperature of about 25 – 26 °C. and more quickly at 37 °C., though at the latter temperature it dies out within a few weeks. At 25 °C. under favorable conditions and in suitable culture media it remains viable for several months without losing its virulence. Leptospira icteroides multiplies by transverse division. The virulence attained by some strains was such that 0. 00001 cc. of a culture could induce typical fatal infection in guinea pigs. There exists a considerable variation among guinea pigs in their susceptibility to Leptospira icteroides. The organism is killed within 10 minutes at a temperature of 55 °C. and is also destroyed by complete desiccation or freezing and thawing. Bile and bile salts dissolve it in certain concentrations, but not saponin. Leptospira icteroides passes through the pores of <b>Berkefeld</b> <b>filters</b> V and N, and there is a possibility of its having a granular phase of life under certain conditions...|$|R
40|$|Since 1911, when Rous (1) {{found that}} a chicken sarcoma could be {{transmitted}} by a ccll-free filtrate, many investigators have attcmpted to isolate and thereby identify the causative agent of this tumor, t Because of the lability of the agent, the usual methods for isolation of the more stable biological substances could not be used. The earlier investigations have been reviewed by Claude and Murphy (2). More recently several investigators (3, 4) have applied the technique of the ultracentrifuge. Though very active sediments were obtained, the material appeared to be far from homogeneous. Two of the present authors have reported (5) that tumors could be produced with lipid extracts of dried tumor tissue. These were still active after filtration through a <b>Berkefeld</b> W <b>filter.</b> Neither by chemical nor by biological methods were proteins demonstrable in these extracts. However, because of the extreme activity of the customary filtered water extracts, the possibility exists that proteins may have been present in such lipid extracts in amounts sufficient to produce tumors but incapable o...|$|R
40|$|Five {{cultures}} of Bacillus welchii {{have been studied}} and compared Four came from infected wounds in the western theatre of war, and one was obtained from a personal article of clothing. Each culture possesses the essential characteristics ascribed to that group of bacteria. The infectious processes caused by the five cultures in rabbits, guinea pigs, and pigeons, are local in character; and very few or no bacilli enter or {{are found in the}} general blood stream during life or immediately after death. Glucose broth cultures, injected intravenously, are fatal to rabbits. Death occurs, almost immediately or after a few hours. Agglutinative bacterial emboli have been ruled out as the cause of death, as has been an acid intoxication. The fluid part of the culture acts {{in the same manner as}} the full culture and irrespective of neutralization with sodium hydroxide. The full cultures and supernatant fluid are hemolytic when injected directly into the circulation of rabbits and pigeons, and the acute death produced may be ascribed to a massive destruction of red corpuscles. The passage of the fluid portion of glucose broth cultures through <b>Berkefeld</b> <b>filters</b> reduces materially the hemolytic and poisonous effects. Cultures of the Welch bacilli in plain broth to which sterile pigeon or rabbit muscle is added are highly toxic, and the toxicity is not noticeably diminished by Berkefeld filtration. The filtrates are hemolytic when injected intravenously and inflaming and necrotizing when injected subcutaneously and intramuscularly. The local lesions produced in the breast muscles of the pigeon closely resemble those caused by infection with the bacilli. The toxicity of these filtrates is not affected by neutralization with sodium hydroxide, but is materially reduced by heating to 62 °C. and entirely removed by heating to 70 °C. for 30 minutes. Successive injections of carefully graded doses of this toxic filtrate in pigeons and rabbits give rise to active immunity. The blood taken from the immunized rabbits is capable of neutralizing the toxic filtrate in vivo and in vitro. The filtrate has therefore been designated as toxin and the immune serum as antitoxin. The antitoxin neutralizes the toxin in multiple proportions. Hence the latter would seem to possess the properties of an exotoxin. Moreover, it neutralizes the hemolytic as well as the locally. injurious toxic constituent. Antitoxic serum prepared from a given culture of Bacillus welchii is neutralizing for the toxins yielded by the other four {{cultures of}} that microorganism. The antitoxin is protective and curative against infection with the spore and the vegetative stages of Bacillus welchii in pigeons. The limits of the protective and curative action are now under investigation...|$|R
40|$|From a {{contagious}} {{respiratory disease}} of cats an agent has been transmitted to mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, and embryonated eggs. When inoculated intranasally into cats, {{it produces a}} disease like that seen in the naturally infected animals. Parenteral injection causes only a mild fever. From cats killed during acute illness, the agent was demonstrated regularly in the discharges from the eyes and nose and in the pneumonic lung but not in other organs. The agent can be demonstrated in the nasal mucosa of cats 1 to 2 months after injection. Cultures of egg yolk sac containing the agent showed no growth, and cultures of active lung suspensions were usually negative, such positive findings as were obtained being due to respiratory contaminants. Attempts to pass the agent through <b>Berkefeld</b> N <b>filters</b> were generally unsuccessful. Stained preparations of egg yolk sac membranes and of infected mouse or hamster lungs showed typical elementary bodies. Centrifuge experiments showed that the agent and the bodies sedimented at the same rate. Complement fixation experiments using a suspension of partially purified bodies as antigen were negative with control sera and positive with sera from recovered cats. It is concluded that the respiratory disease of cats {{is due to a}} virus that forms elementary bodies...|$|R
