5|$|Trying to {{discover}} what happened to Marsh, Quatermass contacts Inspector Lomax (John Longden), who had previously assisted him (see The Quatermass Xperiment). Lomax puts him in touch with Vincent <b>Broadhead</b> (Tom Chatto), a Member of Parliament, who {{has been trying to}} uncover the veil of secrecy surrounding Winnerden Flats. Quatermass joins <b>Broadhead</b> on an official tour of the complex, which he is told has been built to manufacture artificial food. Slipping away from the visiting party, <b>Broadhead</b> attempts to get inside one of the large domes that dominate the skyline. Quatermass later finds him dying, covered in a poisonous black slime.|$|E
5|$|As {{he tries}} to {{investigate}} further, Quatermass finds that other figures in high levels of government have gained 'the mark' after coming across meteorites. Quatermass leaves the inquiry, then returns with Fowler to find that <b>Broadhead</b> has been 'marked' and now claims {{there is no problem}} with the project. Fowler takes Quatermass to meet with civil servant Rupert Ward, who has the authority to inspect the plant. Back at the Rocket Group, Leo and Paula deduce and discover with a radio telescope that an asteroid is orbiting the Earth invisibly and discharging the meteorites when it reaches the near point, 400 000 miles over Southern England every 14 hours.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass {{returns to}} the Rocket Group, where Leo has reconstructed the meteorite, which can carry ammonia and other gases and travel through the {{atmosphere}} {{to the ground in}} one piece. In London, the Metropolitan Police claim they have no jurisdiction over the matter, so he goes to his contact Fowler at the ministry, who reveals that the plant is a top secret project to make synthetic food, but Vincent <b>Broadhead</b> MP, who is conducting an inquiry into the project, reveals that there are identical plants in Brazil and Siberia. Upon gaining entry to the inquiry, Quatermass notices that one of the civil servants has 'the mark'.|$|E
25|$|<b>Broadheads</b> {{were used}} for war and are still used for hunting. Medieval <b>broadheads</b> could be made from steel, {{sometimes}} with hardened edges. They usually have two to four sharp blades that cause massive bleeding in the victim. Their function is to deliver a wide cutting edge so as to kill {{as quickly as possible}} by cleanly cutting major blood vessels, and cause further trauma on removal. They are expensive, damage most targets, and are usually not used for practice.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the bodkin came into its own as a means of penetrating armour, but research by the Royal Armouries has found no hardened bodkin points, though only two bodkin points were actually tested, not a statistically relevant number. Bodkins did, however, have greater ability to pierce mail armour than <b>broadheads,</b> and historical accounts do speak of bodkin arrows shot from close range piercing plate armour. <b>Broadheads</b> were made from steel, sometimes with hardened edges, but were more often used against lightly armoured men or horses than against an armoured adversary.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Broadheads</b> {{were used}} for war and are still used for hunting. Information on {{regional}} Arabic arrowheads found from the period 100BC-150AD in the United Arab Emirates show the use of three-bladed <b>broadheads,</b> or trilobate arrowhead. [...] "A trilobate arrowhead {{can be defined as}} an arrowhead that has three wings or blades that are usually placed at equal angles (i.e. c. 120°) around the imaginary longitudinal axis extending from the centre of the socket or tang. Since this type of arrowhead is rare in southeastern Arabia, we must investigate its origin and the reasons behind its presence at ed-Dur." ...|$|R
5|$|There were {{a number}} of first-team {{personnel}} changes from the previous campaign, with only six first-team players staying at the club. Centre forward Joe Eddleston, Nelson's top scorer in 1921–22 with 16 league goals, remained along with Clement Rigg, Sid Hoad and Bob Lilley. Scottish defenders John Steel and James Price also continued to play for Nelson. Among those who left the club were Harold Andrews, who joined Bury, and Irish international inside forward Billy Halligan, who retired from professional football. Goalkeepers Harry Heyes and Robert Bruce both moved on in the close season, so Stockport County custodian Joseph Birds was signed as a replacement in June 1922. In an attempt to improve the attacking prowess at the club, Wilson signed experienced inside forward Arthur Wolstenholme on a free transfer from Darlington in May 1922, and Scottish forward Mike McCulloch arrived from Heart of Midlothian for a transfer fee of £150. Wilson also added to the defensive ranks with the signings of his former Oldham Athletic team-mate Ernie Braidwood, and of Jimmy <b>Broadhead</b> on a free transfer from Scunthorpe & Lindsey United.|$|E
5|$|Other {{locations}} used {{included the}} real-life new town of Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, which was under construction {{at the time}} and doubled for the fictional new town of Winnerden Flats. Other scenes were shot in London including Trafalgar Square, where the police agreed to hold up the traffic for just two minutes to allow Guest to take shots of trucks ferrying equipment through London to Winnerden Flats, and in the foyer of the House of Lords for the scene where Quatermass first meets Vincent <b>Broadhead.</b> The climactic scenes of the hurricane caused by the explosion of the Winnerden Flats complex were shot on the South Downs near Brighton. A minor mishap occurred during the filming of this scene when the wind machines blew Brian Donlevy's toupée off his head and the crew had to chase after it. As well as shooting on location, Guest and his crew made use of Stages 2 and 5 of the New Elstree Studios, the first Hammer production to shoot there. This was production designer Bernard Robinson's first film for Hammer; he went on to become their regular set designer, working on many Hammer films.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of broadheads used by hunters: The fixed-blade and the {{mechanical}} types. While the fixed-blade <b>broadhead</b> keeps its blades rigid and unmovable on the <b>broadhead</b> at all times, the mechanical <b>broadhead</b> deploys its blades upon contact with the target, its blades swinging out to wound the target. The mechanical head flies better {{because it is more}} streamlined, but has less penetration as it uses some of the kinetic energy in the arrow to deploy its blades.|$|E
40|$|Measuring {{an arrow}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{ballistic}} performance such as arrow velocity on impact, total {{time of flight}} and arrow shaft oscillation is challenging because of the dynamic nature of arrow flight. This challenge becomes increasingly difficult as {{the distance of the}} shot increases. It is also of great interest to bowhunters to understand the ballistic performance of arrows that include hunting <b>broadheads.</b> A miniaturized, sensory data acquisition system, located in the arrow tip and engineered to withstand the high accelerations experienced at launch and impact, enables the precise measurement of arrow ballistics in flight. By continuously recording arrow drag in flight, the system enables measurement of the ballistic performance of an arrow as it travels downrange. The authors have also built an adapter that is connected to the housing of the sensing system to allow for comparative ballistic tests to be performed on hunting <b>broadheads.</b> Here, we present results obtained using the sensing system to perform initial testing on two commercially available <b>broadheads</b> at shot distances of approximately 45 m...|$|R
5000|$|On 12 May Velocipede {{began his}} three-year-old {{campaign}} in the York [...] "St Leger" [...] over a distance of one and three-quarter miles. Ridden by Bill Scott, he started at odds of 1/2 and won from Mr <b>Broadhead's</b> unnamed grey colt and four others.|$|R
50|$|Five plays later, Carroll scored another touchdown, {{helped by}} Dane <b>Broadhead's</b> {{back-to-back}} 25+ yard passes, the second {{for a touchdown}} to Anthony Clarke with 39 {{seconds left in the}} half. Tom Yaremko's extra point kick was good and the score at the half ended Saint Xavier 17, Carroll 14.|$|R

50|$|At Crécy and Agincourt bowmen {{unleashed}} {{clouds of}} arrows {{into the ranks}} of knights. At Crécy, even 5,000 Genoese crossbowmen could not dislodge them from their hill. At Agincourt, thousands of French knights were brought down by armour-piercing bodkin point arrows and horse-maiming <b>broadheads.</b> Longbowmen decimated an entire generation of the French nobility.|$|R
5000|$|The shotgun is {{a popular}} weapon for hunting wild turkey. Shotgun gauges used in turkey hunting include 10, 12, 16, and 20 gauge.#2, #4, #5, and #6 lead shot is often used in 2 3/4", 3", or 3 1/2" [...] shotshells. Bow and arrow is {{starting}} to become popular among hunters. Common hunting <b>broadheads</b> are used for body shots while [...] "guillotine" [...] style <b>broadheads</b> are intended {{to remove the head}} with the shot. Some states even allow small caliber rifles to be used while pursuing turkeys. Turkey hunters usually wear full camouflage, from head to toe, to conceal themselves from the wild turkey's excellent eyesight. This includes pants, shirt, hat, boots, gloves, and a mask. Many hunters wear a turkey vest with a cushion to sit on and compartments to carry their calls and dead turkeys.|$|R
25|$|Field tips {{are similar}} to target points and have a {{distinct}} shoulder, so that missed outdoor shots do not become as stuck in obstacles such as tree stumps. They are also used for shooting practice by hunters, by offering similar flight characteristics and weights as <b>broadheads,</b> without getting lodged in target materials and causing excessive damage upon removal.|$|R
25|$|During {{the course}} of his deception, Reavis managed to {{convince}} a number of prominent persons to support his efforts. He obtained legal and political support from Roscoe Conkling, Robert G. Ingersoll and James <b>Broadhead.</b> Business leaders such as Charles Crocker and John W. Mackay in turn provided financial support. Initial exposure of the fraud occurred when an unfavorable Surveyor General report caused the claim to be summarily dismissed. In response to this action, Reavis sued the U.S. government for US$11 million in damages ($ in present-day terms). The suit in turn prompted the U.S. government to perform a detailed investigation that fully exposed the forgeries Reavis had planted in a variety of locations.|$|E
25|$|These are short, {{rigid points}} {{with a small}} cross-section. They were made of unhardened iron {{and may have been}} used for better or longer flight, or for cheaper production. It has been mistakenly {{suggested}} that the bodkin came into its own as a means of penetrating armour, but research has found no hardened bodkin points, so it is likely that it was first designed either to extend range or as a cheaper and simpler alternative to the <b>broadhead.</b> In a modern test, a direct hit from a hard steel bodkin point penetrated Damascus chain armour. However, archery was not effective against plate armour, which became available to knights of fairly modest means by the late 14th century.|$|E
25|$|Several other personalities on Canada's sports {{networks}} have also {{spent time in}} Saskatchewan. Peter Loubardias, currently the voice of Canadian Hockey League games on Rogers Sportsnet, was at one time the host of Sportsline on then-STV (now Global) in Saskatoon. As well, Roger Millions, the current voice of the Calgary Flames on Rogers Sportsnet was also on Sportsline on then-STV in Saskatoon. R.J. <b>Broadhead</b> who is host of Sportsnet Connected on Rogers Sportsnet, was also the sports reporter on Global Saskatoon's evening newscasts. Jay Onrait is currently an anchor on Fox Sports Live on Fox Sports 1 in the United States; at one point, he was the sports director at Global Saskatoon.|$|E
50|$|The {{arrowhead}} is {{the primary}} functional component of the arrow. Some arrows may simply use a sharpened tip of the solid shaft, but separate arrowheads are far more common, usually made from metal, stone, or other hard materials. The most commonly used forms are target points, field points, and <b>broadheads,</b> although there are also other types, such as bodkin, judo, and blunt heads.|$|R
50|$|Arrows, {{bows and}} sights are {{commonly}} {{of the more}} modern varieties. However, all effective variations, including crossbows and wooden bows launching wooden arrows with stone points, are used. Arrowheads are chosen to ensure lethality. <b>Broadheads</b> feature blades that jut out from the shaft {{at an angle to}} cause more damage to the target; some models have retractable blades that only deploy once they hit the target.|$|R
5000|$|Modern arrowheads {{used for}} hunting {{come in a}} variety of classes and styles. Many traditionalist archers choose heads made of modern high carbon steel that closely {{resemble}} traditional stone heads (see Variants). Other classes of <b>broadheads</b> referred to as [...] "mechanical" [...] and [...] "hybrid" [...] are gaining popularity. Often, these heads rely on force created by passing through an animal to expand or open.|$|R
25|$|There {{are four}} Paleo Indians sites. One is in Warren County {{and the other}} three are nearby. The Plenge site located {{on the north side of}} the Musconetcong River in Franklin Township, Warren County. This site is {{estimated}} at 10,000 B.C. The Zierdt site is located near the Delaware River in Montague Township. The next is the Dutchess Cave in Orange County, New York, just east of the Wallkill River. This site is dated at 10,580 B.C. + or - 370 years. Caribou bones and a spear point was located at this site. The last is the Shawnee site located north of the Delaware Water Gap on the west side of the river, where <b>Broadhead</b> Creek enters the Delaware in Pennsylvania. This site is dated from charcoal found at 8640 B.C. + or - 300 years.|$|E
500|$|The {{accusation}} angered Grant, {{who fired}} Henderson as special prosecutor. Grant then replaced Henderson with James <b>Broadhead.</b> [...] <b>Broadhead,</b> though a capable attorney, {{had little time}} to get acquainted with the facts of Babcock's case {{and those of other}} Whiskey Ring members. [...] At the trial a deposition was read from President Grant stating that he had no knowledge that Babcock was involved in the ring. [...] The jury listened to the president's words and quickly acquitted Babcock of any charges. [...] <b>Broadhead</b> went on to close out all the other cases in the Whiskey Ring. [...] McDonald and Joyce were convicted in the graft trials and sent to prison. On January 26, 1877, President Grant pardoned McDonald.|$|E

5000|$|In 1987, Mike Grell {{wrote and}} drew the three-issue {{prestige}} format limited series Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters. He redesigned the character's costume, away from the costume Neal Adams had designed in 1969, and recast Green Arrow as an [...] "urban hunter" [...] going up against non-super-powered, real world villains such as serial killers, terrorists, street gangs, American mobsters and Japanese Yakuza. He did away with Green Arrow's arsenal of [...] "trick arrows" [...] and instead rearmed him with penetrating <b>broadheads</b> with which he actually killed his opponents. The Longbow Hunters showed the first instance in which Green Arrow ever deliberately killed someone; in the follow-on series this occurred frequently.|$|R
40|$|By bone {{remodeling}} {{and changing}} of muscle volume, fish can adapt {{to changes in}} mechanical loads they are confronted with, including dietary changes such as prey hardness. This capability of a genotype to develop different phenotypes in response to varying environment is known as phenotypic plasticity. Differences in prey type being consumed might trigger such a phenotypic plasticity in fish. In European eel, two morphotypes exist: <b>broadheads</b> and narrowheads. Studies based on gut content have shown that <b>broadheads</b> consume larger and harder prey, such as fish, whereas narrowheads feed on smaller prey, such as benthic invertebrates. These studies, however, are performed on yellow eels with a minimum length of 30 cm, and only provide indirect evidence that head shape is affected by diet differences. Here, we performed a feeding experiment on glass eels that just swam up the European rivers to start feeding. These glass eels were captured and separated in three groups: one group was given hard feed requiring biting, the second group got soft feed that could be sucked in and the final group, which acted as a control group, was given a mixture of both. We found that hard feeders developed a broader general head width and postorbital region than soft feeders. This region {{is associated with the}} location of the jaw muscles, indicating that hard feeders develop larger muscles to cope with the harder prey. Hard feeders, however, also grew more slowly than soft feeders, suggesting that net energy uptake of hard feeders was lower as prey handling required more energy and time. Specimens of the control group, finally, developed intermediate head widths, implying that they are not fully adapted to feed on either hard or soft prey. In conclusion, this study provides the first direct evidence that diet influences the head shape of European eel...|$|R
2500|$|Whenever natural {{fletching}} is used, {{the feathers}} {{on any one}} arrow must {{come from the same}} wing of the bird. The most common being the right-wing flight feathers of turkeys. [...] The slight cupping of natural feathers requires them to be fletched with a right-twist for right wing, a left-twist for left wing. This rotation, through a combination of gyroscopic stabilization and increased drag on the rear of the arrow, helps the arrow to fly straight away. [...] Artificial helical fletchings have the same effect. Most arrows will have three fletches, but some have four or even more. Fletchings generally range from two to six inches (152mm) in length; flight arrows intended to travel the maximum possible distance typically have very low fletching, while hunting arrows with <b>broadheads</b> require long and high fletching to stabilize them against the aerodynamic effect of the head. [...] Fletchings may also be cut in different ways, the two most common being parabolic (i.e. a smooth curved shape) and shield (i.e. shaped as one-half of a very narrow shield) cut.|$|R
500|$|The League of Gentlemens Mark Gatiss {{mentions}} on the DVD commentary for the First Series that a {{scene where}} two workmen, who have been abducted by Tubs and Edward, escape, covered in tar, {{was inspired by the}} scene in which Vincent <b>Broadhead</b> is covered in [...] "Synthetic Food" [...] from one of the labelled storage tanks.|$|E
500|$|At {{the edge}} of the park, the trail crosses Water Street and enters the Water Street Market, a [...] "restored area of boutiques, galleries, and cafés". It then crosses State Route 299 and passes La Stazione, the former {{railroad}} station. The refurbished depot had been originally built in 1870, rebuilt after a 1907 fire, and sold to private interests in 1959. The building {{was in a state of}} disrepair by the early 1980s, but renovated in 1988 and converted to an Italian restaurant in 1999. Over the next , the trail passes North Front Street, <b>Broadhead</b> Avenue, and Mulberry Street. After another [...] the trail traverses Huguenot Street, a historic district containing colonial-era stone houses. Some of the houses date to the late 1600s.|$|E
500|$|In {{south central}} Pennsylvania, the Marcellus is mapped with three members, {{from top to}} base: The Mahanoy Member(Dmm), a dark gray to grayish black silty shale and siltstone; the Turkey Ridge Member(Dmt), an olive to dark-gray fine to medium grained sandstone; and the Shamokin Member(Dms), a dark gray to grayish black fissile {{carbonaceous}} shale that is calcareous in places near the base. The Turkey Ridge is commonly mapped in the Mahantango Formation, or included in the Montebello Formation(Dmot), and only the Shamokin correlates with the Marcellus on adjacent map sheets. In extreme eastern Pennsylvania, the <b>Broadhead</b> Creek member, a dark gray silty shale with dark gray shaly limestone concretions, appears above the Stony Hollow and Union Springs, in a layer up to [...] thick.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{took place}} between 28 May and 13 July 1956. The film's budget, at £92,000, was much larger than that of The Quatermass Xperiment. The bigger budget was {{achieved}} by the advance sale of the distribution rights in the United States to United Artists. United Artists contributed some £64,000 towards {{the production of the}} film, as well as Brian Donlevy's $25,000 fee and his airfare to London from the US. The larger budget allowed for greater use of location filming in the making of the film than had been possible for its predecessor. The key location used was the oil refinery at Shell Haven in Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, on the Thames Estuary, which represented the secret Winnerden Flats complex. This was exactly the same location as used in the BBC television production of the story. Despite its size, the plant was run by {{a relatively small number of}} personnel, which made Guest's job of making the plant appear eerily deserted easier. Guest was also surprised at how relaxed the plant's management were about allowing him to stage the climactic gun battle at such a potentially flammable location. Focus puller Harry Oakes recalled, however, that a Newman-Sinclair clockwork camera had to be used for some scenes because of the danger posed by sparks from electrical equipment. The scenes of Vincent <b>Broadhead</b> emerging from one of the domes covered in the noxious black slime were particularly difficult to realise, necessitating many retakes. Tom Chatto, playing <b>Broadhead,</b> whose wife was a leading casting director, joked after the scene was finally completed, [...] "Remind me to talk to my wife about casting me in this". The Shell Haven location was further enhanced by the use of matte paintings created by special effects designer Les Bowie to add the giant domes within which the aliens were incubated.|$|E
500|$|Four {{actors who}} each became {{well known for}} a {{particular}} role on British television had supporting parts in Quatermass II. Rupert Davies who played MP Vincent <b>Broadhead</b> {{would go on to}} find fame as Sûreté detective Commissaire Jules Maigret, the title character of 1960s TV series Maigret, based on Georges Simenon's novels. Roger Delgado, who found fame in the 1970s as the Master in Doctor Who (1971–73), played a journalist who helps Quatermass before falling victim to [...] "the mark" [...] in episode four. Wilfrid Brambell, later star of the sitcom Steptoe and Son (1962–74) and The Beatles' film A Hard Day's Night (1964), appeared as a tramp, and Melvyn Hayes, who played the small role of Frankie, became {{one of the stars of}} the popular sitcom It Ain't Half Hot Mum (1974–81).|$|E
