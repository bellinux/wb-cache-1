It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith, reserving infallibility, passed down by sacred tradition. The Latin Church, the Eastern Catholic Churches, and institutes such as mendicant orders and enclosed monastic orders reflect a variety of theological and spiritual emphases in the Church.|$|E

5|$|The Persians took {{advantage}} of this {{civil war in the}} Byzantine empire by conquering frontier towns in Armenia and Upper Mesopotamia. Along the Euphrates, in 609, they conquered Mardin and Amida (Diyarbakır). Edessa, which some Christians are said to have believed would be defended <b>by</b> <b>Jesus</b> himself on behalf of King Abgar V of Edessa against all enemies, fell in 610.|$|E
5|$|Fragments 2 and 3, giving {{accounts}} of Jesus' baptism and temptation or transfiguration, {{spring from the}} widespread Greco-Roman myth of the descent of divine Wisdom; this underlies the parallel passages in the gospels of Matthew(11.25–30), Luke(7.18–35 and 11.49–51) and John(1.1–18), {{as well as the}} Gospel of Thomas. The differences between fragment 3 and the orthodox canonical gospels are considerable: their third-person narrative has become an account <b>by</b> <b>Jesus</b> himself, Satan is replaced by the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is identified as Jesus' mother.|$|E

50|$|The Gospel of John {{generally}} {{presents the}} point of view of realized eschatology—that the kingdom of heaven was established <b>by</b> <b>Jesus's</b> resurrection. The redactor is theorized to have inserted elements of future eschatology—the view that a future kingdom of heaven has yet to be realized but will at a point in the future.|$|R
40|$|This article {{suggests}} ecstatic or apocalyptic visions, {{within which}} pregnant women symbolize an anticipated redemption, {{function as an}} instrument of liminal peoples, including women. Thus women's visionary experience, seen in the light of Jewish messianic expectations, is the mother of the special proclamations made <b>by</b> <b>Jesus's</b> women followers, including the canonical proclamations of Jesus's resurrection...|$|R
5|$|The Christian {{religion}} {{is based on}} the teachings of Jesus Christ, who lived and preached in the 1st century AD in the province of Judea of the Roman Empire. Catholic doctrine teaches that the contemporary Catholic Church is the continuation of this early Christian community established <b>by</b> <b>Jesus.</b> Christianity spread throughout the early Roman Empire, despite persecutions due to conflicts with the pagan state religion. Emperor Constantine legalised the practice of Christianity in 313, and it became the state religion in 380. Germanic invaders of Roman territory in the 5th and 6th centuries, many of whom had previously adopted Arian Christianity, eventually adopted Catholicism to ally themselves with the papacy and the monasteries.|$|E
5|$|The Eucharistic celebration, {{also called}} the Mass or Divine liturgy, {{includes}} prayers and scriptural readings, {{as well as an}} offering of bread and wine, which are brought to the altar and consecrated by the priest to become the body and the blood of Jesus Christ, a change called transubstantiation. The words of consecration reflect the words spoken <b>by</b> <b>Jesus</b> during the Last Supper, where Christ offered his body and blood to his Apostles the night before his crucifixion. The sacrament re-presents (makes present) the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, and perpetuates it. Christ's death and resurrection gives grace through the sacrament that unites the faithful with Christ and one another, remits venial sin, and aids against committing moral sin (though mortal sin itself is forgiven through the sacrament of penance).|$|E
5|$|In {{the buildup}} towards the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament, the team's first major {{competition}} since their 2008 {{run at the}} same event, manager Slaven Bilić formally agreed a deal to manage Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow, thereby announcing he would resign from the national team when the tournament ended. Croatia opened their campaign with a comfortable 3–1 victory over the Republic of Ireland, with striker Mario Mandžukić scoring twice. Mandžukić continued his run at the tournament with an equaliser in the 1–1 draw against Italy, which was marred by controversial fan reactions and referee decisions from English official Howard Webb. In their last group match, Croatia suffered a 0–1 defeat to Spain. The late Spanish goal <b>by</b> <b>Jesús</b> Navas, along with Italy's victory over the Republic of Ireland in the final round, forced Croatia to exit the tournament in the group stage once again. Upon his formal departure, Bilić was also praised for his long-standing service to the national side. Jutarnji List daily labelled him as Croatia's only manager to depart on such positive terms and credited him for his strong revival of the national side during his six-year tenure.|$|E
50|$|Ratzinger has {{maintained}} that the Catholic Church does not possess the authority to ordain women to the priestly sacramental ministry (the Vatican, and the Catholic Church by extension, have long held that this is shown <b>by</b> <b>Jesus's</b> choosing only men as apostles, saying this was the constant practice and consistent teaching of the Church).|$|R

25|$|Artworks, {{including}} paintings, mosaics and carvings of {{the coronation}} of Mary as Queen of Heaven, became increasingly popular from the 13th century onward.

The Coronation of Mary is almost entirely a theme of western art. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, although Mary is often shown wearing a crown, the coronation itself never became an accepted artistic subject.|$|E
