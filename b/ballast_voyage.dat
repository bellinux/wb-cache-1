5000|$|Inert gas is {{produced}} on board crude oil carriers (above 8,000 tonnes)(from Jan 1, 2016) by using either a flue gas system or by burning kerosene in a dedicated inert gas generator. The inert gas system {{is used to}} prevent the atmosphere in cargo tanks or bunkers from coming into the explosive range. IG keeps the oxygen content of the tank atmosphere below 5% (on crude carriers, less for product carriers and gas tankers), thus making any air/hydrocarbon gas mixture in the tank too rich (too high a fuel to oxygen ratio) to ignite. IG is most important during discharging and during the <b>ballast</b> <b>voyage</b> when more hydrocarbon vapour {{is likely to be}} present in the tank atmosphere. Inert gas {{can also be used to}} purge the tank of the volatile atmosphere in preparation for gas freeing - replacing the atmosphere with breathable air - or vice versa.|$|E
50|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} carrying wet or dry cargoes. The idea is {{to reduce the number of}} empty (<b>ballast)</b> <b>voyages,</b> in which large ships only carry a cargo one way and return empty for another. These are a feature of the larger bulk trades (e.g. crude oil from the Middle East, iron ore and coal from Australia, South Africa and Brazil).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the research {{conducted for the}} MARIDES project, which aims to improve the chartering process in shipping companies. MARIDES (Maritime Decision Support) focuses {{on the development of}} the necessary decision support software tools, which operate in an integrated environment. As far as decision support is concerned, given a certain chartering order, the system will estimate all the possible solutions (all vessels that can serve the given order) and it will present them to the user sorted, according to the estimated profit. Apart from deterministic data, stochastic data is utilized as well and the system will take into consideration data such as the future market potential. This is achieved through estimation of the <b>ballast</b> <b>voyage</b> in order to load the next cargo after the completion of the current order 1.

40|$|The {{ballast water}} {{exchange}} methods in open sea are, {{for the time}} being, the prevailing procedures accepted by shipowners. However, such methods do not guarantee full efficacy in elimination of allochthonous organisms. Besides, in some navigation zones, in particular in the closed seas, not even the criteria prescribed by international regulations can be fulfilled, i. e. {{the position of a}} ship exchanging ballast must be farther than 200 Nm from the shore (alternatively 50 Nm) at the sea depth exceeding 200 m. Numerous research attempts on various treatment methods lead to the conclusion that there is still no scientific opinion on the final choice of methods for wide application on board. The treatment methods, such as hydrocyclone separation in the first stage and UV radiation in the second stage, stand a good chance for application on board. Advantages of such a combined method are in the very application of treatment that can be performed during all stages of ballast water treatment, i. e. loading <b>ballast,</b> <b>voyage</b> in ballast and discharging ballast. In closed seas and on shorter routes the operational advantages of hydrocyclone and UV radiation could be the prevailing factor for application. Within the research on the possible application of ballast water treatment by hydrocyclone and UV radiation, a pilot plant with hydrocyclone cluster and UV device was constructed. The research carried out on the pilot plant installed on board the m/v ‘’Naše more’’ proved the effectiveness of such ballast water treatment method and offered a new approach in using hydrocyclone for the inactivation of organisms by hydrodynamic forces. This approach has largely increased the efficacy of the device and a new method for utilization of hydrocyclone in ballast water treatment on board has been discovered.

40|$|Liquefied {{natural gas}} (LNG) tanker vessel is {{operated}} to carry natural gas at cargo temperature of around - 163 °C. The containment {{system is designed}} to allow heat to escape into the cargo area. Around 0. 15 % of boil-off gas (BOG) is typically present in the cargo volume per day. Thus, the cargoes from the loading terminal are not fully delivered to the client due to the BOG phenomenon. This thesis looks into the utilization of BOG in the boiler. Modem marine boilers installed onboard the LNG carriers are capable of burning 100 % BOG or heavy fuel oil (HFO). It can also use both BOG and HFO in a dual fuel burning operation. A Malaysia International Shipping Corporation (MISC) Berhad vessel which has operated for five voyages and has the same shared route of loading and discharge port {{was identified as a}} sample. The data main source was from the vessel's engine log book. The investigation is conducted by profiling the steam system onboard. On further analysis, the estimated fuel costs and operating characteristics of the facility were determined, focusing on evaluating the fuel to steam conversion efficiency of the boiler. It was found that during the laden voyage, more energy saving of BOG was obtained as compared to HFO in the range of 72. 9 % to 97. 6 % whilst in the <b>ballast</b> <b>voyage,</b> less BOG was obtained in the range of 7 % to 75. 9 %. The percentage energy saved varies whereby the percentage is high when vessel encountered shorter routes or purposely more BOG been utilized through forced boil-off method. The plant efficiency is about the same regardless of the type of fuel burnt in the boiler, whether it is burning combined BOG and HFO, 100 % BOG or 100 % HFO. The only difference is the amount of fuel burnt in the boiler. Hence, it is the owner best interest to decide which fuel to use that provides lesser fuel consumption and less cos...|$|E

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the main}} {{concerns}} of our society is certainly environmental protection. The international efforts for maintaining a clean environment are various and this paper refers to the efforts in the maritime transport field. The subject of our study {{is the concept of}} Energy Efficiency Operational Index (EEOI), developed to provide ship-owners with assistance in the process of establishing the emissions from ships in operation, and to suggest the methods for achieving their reduction. As a monitoring tool, EEOI represents the mass of CO 2 emitted per unit of transport work. Using the software developed by the authors, it will emphasize the variation of the EEOI value for one vessel using different types of fuel during the laden and <b>ballast</b> <b>voyages,</b> for a period of three months, as stated in the Ship's Log Books. The main consumers considered are Main Engine, Diesel Generators and steam Boilers, and the types of fuel used will be as per charter party agreements and following the specific international and local rules and regulations. The results for the quality parameter EEOI and the average cost of achieving them will be included in compared cost-to-quality graphs, in order to underline the profitability of the studied methods for minimizing the air emissions...|$|R

Oil and ore ships had been in operation since the 1920s, but a vessel with the capability of carrying both oil and bulk cargoes seemed impossible to construct. Næss pushed his chief naval architect T. M. Karlsen to keep researching the combined vessel, also checking in on various failed projects like the Mando Theodoracopulos. One of the deficiencies of that vessel was the small hatches, too small for efficient discharging.|$|R

40|$|Studies {{of marine}} viromes (viral metagenomes) have {{revealed}} that DNA viruses are highly diverse and exhibit biogeographic patterns. However, {{little is known about}} the diversity of RNA viruses, which are mostly composed of eukaryotic viruses, and their biogeographic patterns in the oceans. A growth in global commerce and maritime traffic may accelerate spread of diverse and non-cosmopolitan DNA viruses and potentially RNA viruses from one part of the world to another. Here, we demonstrated through metagenomic analyses that failure to comply with mid-ocean ballast water exchange regulation could result in movement of viromes including both DNA viruses and RNA viruses (including potential viral pathogens) unique to geographic and environmental niches. Furthermore, our results showed that virus richness (known and unknown viruses) in ballast water is associated with distance between ballast water exchange location and its nearest shoreline as well as length of water storage time in <b>ballast</b> tanks (<b>voyage</b> duration). However, richness of only known viruses is governed by local environmental conditions and different viral groups have different responses to environmental variation. Overall, these results identified ballast water as a factor contributing to ocean virome transport and potentially increased exposure of the aquatic bioshpere to viral invasion...|$|R
40|$|A major vector for unintentional species {{introductions}} is international shipping. A {{wide range}} of organisms have been transported over long distances in ships' ballast tanks and as hull fouling. Although many desk studies and ship sampling programmes have been carried out, little information is available on changing numbers of individuals in <b>ballast</b> water during <b>voyages.</b> Detailed information could assist in evaluating the dimension of species import and future risks of unintentional species introductions by ballast water. The first European study, organised as a concerted action team and financed by the European Union, carried out several long-term and short-term workshops on board ships undertaking international voyages. The preliminary results from sampling the ballast water of the first four oceangoing workshops of this Concerted Action showed a decrease in numbers of specimens and taxa over time...|$|R
40|$|The {{observed}} {{rates and}} deleterious impacts of biological invasions have caused significant alarm in recent years, driving {{efforts to reduce}} the risk (establishment) of new introductions. Characterizing the supply of propagules is key to understanding invasion risk and developing effective management strategies. In coastal ecosystems, ships' ballast water is an important transfer mechanism (vector) for marine and freshwater species. Commercial ships exhibit a high degree of variation in ballast water operations that affect both {{the quantity and quality of}} propagule supply, and thereby invasion risk. The per-ship inoculation size from ballast water depends upon both the volume discharged and the organism density. Moreover, propagule quality will vary among source regions (ports) and voyage routes, due to differences in species composition and transport conditions, respectively. We show that significant differences exist in (i) the frequency and volume of ballast water discharge among vessel types, (ii) the frequency of vessel types and routes (source regions) among recipient ports, and (iii) the transit success (survivorship) of zooplankton in <b>ballast</b> tanks among <b>voyage</b> routes. Thus, propagule supply is not a simple function of total ship arrivals. For ships, as well as other vectors, variation in propagule quantity and quality must be explicitly considered to estimate invasion risk and advance predictive ability...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the efficacy of}} the first ten months of the Oregon Ballast Water Management Program, which was established by SB 895 during the 2001 legislative session. The Oregon Ballast Water Management Program was initiated to address the introduction of aquatic nuisance species via discharge of ballast water from ships. The Program reflects the Oregon Legislature’s recognition of the potential for aquatic nuisance species to cause economic and environmental damage to the State. Oregon Laws 2001, Chapter 722 (Appendix A), required that owners and operators of certain vessels entering Oregon waters must report the time and place ballast water was taken on and released during the <b>voyage.</b> <b>Ballast</b> water management procedures must be reported to the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) at least 24 hours prior to entering waters of the state. Ballast water reporting forms required by ODEQ are the same as the forms used by neighboring states and the US Coast Guard (USCG). The law also required that the director of the ODEQ establish a task force to evaluate the success of the law and recommend appropriate changes to the 2003 Legislature. Staffing and coordination of the task force was tasked to Portland State University, subject to availability of funds. This report summarizes ballast water management activities in Oregon during the first ten months of the program (January through October 2002), and makes recommendations for amendments to Oregon laws 2001, Chapter 722 based upon compliance of the shipping industry with the law; advances in ballast treatment technologies, development of treatment standards; effectiveness of open-ocean exchange as a means of treatment; compatibility of the Oregon ballast water policy with those of the United States, west coast states and provinces; research advances; amendments to the National Invasive Species Act; and consistency of ballast water management with other invasive species management activities in Oregon...|$|R
