40|$|This {{investigation}} {{sought to}} determine if a quicksetting type lithographic ink printed into the bind edge of an adhesive bound product influences adhesion at the spine in a negative manner. The testing system included four (4) paper lots; two (2) coated and two (2) uncoated, five (5) ink levels; 0. 0 to 2. 2 (10 percent) solid ink density, and three (3) testing times. Two (2) methods were chosen to test variables. The first was considered a traditional, practical method of <b>binding</b> <b>book</b> blocks which included selected test units that were later pulled from the block. The second method sought to simulate the adhesive bind condition through lamination of a test unit, hotmelt and an internally strong base paper. Although a quick test of this sort would be valuable from a production quality control viewpoint, further experimentation and analysis indentified this configuration as not being a valid predictor for the pagepull test, at this time. Based upon the results gathered from this investigation using a pagepull technique, the statement tying a quicksetting type lithographic ink to a loss of adhesion at the spine of an adhesive bound product can not be supported...|$|E

40|$|Even if for a {{long time}} the art of <b>binding</b> <b>books</b> {{was one of the most}} {{important}} branches of applied art, it has remained largely unexplored. Yet, apart from several covers preserved in Dalmatia going down to the 14 th century, the archival sources disclose names of several masters engaged in the trade. The same origins bear witness to the great interest taken in books in Dalmatia at that time so that sin gle monasteries, in order to keep in use as many books as possible, established their own bookbinderies. It is illustrative for this purpose that in the monastery of the Little Brothers we may still find old tools used for the production of »blind print« in the sixteenth- century leather covers. We have good evidence that Marko Marulić also praised the art of <b>binding</b> <b>books.</b> Namely, in his will he particularly mentions one of his manuscripts with covers made of buffalo-horn, a precious and rare binding material. The Scientific Library and the Archeological Museum at Split preserve a couple of masterly executed covers for Marulić 2 ̆ 7 s books going down to the sixteenth century. In Marulić 2 ̆ 7 s time books were not bound in the printing-houses where they were printed but only on the expressed demand of their owners who, as a rule, would commission only the <b>binding</b> of the <b>books</b> which they held in high esteem or those that were frequently used, for hard covers preserved books from decay. The existing covers of Marulić 2 ̆ 7 s books at Split bear decorations printed on light-brown and dark-brown leather, with vegetable, figural and geometric motifs going down to the Renaissance period. Although they appear related to similar Venetian covers, it is reasonable to suppose that they were produced somewhere in Dalmatia for at that time some excellent binders were active in Split, as well...|$|R
