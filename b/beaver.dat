5|$|Catawissa Creek enters Columbia County in <b>Beaver</b> Township. It {{immediately}} {{passes by}} Bunker Hill and makes several meanders and passes by <b>Beaver</b> Valley. An old Conrail railroad starts paralleling Catawissa Creek at this point. In {{the southern part}} of <b>Beaver</b> Township, the creek is situated between Buck Mountain to the east and Catawissa Mountain to the west. The creek takes a sharp turn westwards as it passes by Shumans, where Pennsylvania Route 339 crosses the creek and <b>Beaver</b> Run flows into it. The creek closely follows Catawissa Mountain for a short distance before turning northwards and passing close to McCauley Mountain. It meanders past Dry Ridge and then Full Mill Hill, where Pennsylvania Route 339 crosses it again. The creek makes a hairpin turn northwards and picks up Gap Run before exiting <b>Beaver</b> Township.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Beaver</b> Mill Lumber Company {{became one}} of the largest single lumber {{operations}} in all of Pennsylvania, and four lumber boomtowns, <b>Beaver</b> Mills, Star Mill, Underwood Mills, and Antes, altered the landscape in the Black Moshannon area. A dam was built at the site of an old <b>beaver</b> dam, and the mill ponds for the lumber mills flooded the old <b>beaver</b> ponds. The communities featured general stores, blacksmith shops, liveries, taverns, schools, and even a ten-pin bowling alley. The area helped to meet the nation's need for timber in mining operations, construction, and railroads.|$|E

50|$|Judging {{from the}} past six meetings, there was little {{indication}} that the <b>Beavers</b> would {{stand in the way}} of victory number 40. From 1908 to 1911, the <b>Beavers</b> were outscored 109-0 in four meetings with Washington. The <b>Beavers</b> managed a single field goal in a 9-3 loss in Portland in 1912.

The routes proceed northward through Ellicottville as a two-lane roadway through dense forestry, bending northward along the creek and a nearby railroad track. The dense forestry remains for several miles, before bending northeast into an intersection with Fancy Tract Road. NY240 and CR32 continue northeast as the dense woods retreat for residences before bending northwest away from <b>Beaver</b> Meadows Creek. After bending northward once more, the routes cross through large fields and past several houses along West Valley Road.|$|E

5|$|Records of otters preying upon beavers (Castor canadensis) vary; it {{has been}} {{reported}} in the southern boreal forest of Manitoba.

5|$|River otters are not scavengers; {{they avoid}} {{consuming}} carrion. Northern river otters do not generally handle prey {{of a large}} size relative to themselves but there are occasions where they've been observed ambushing and killing adult common snapping turtles while the large turtles (which are roughly equal in average body weight to a river otter) are hibernating. Remains of the much larger American <b>beaver</b> {{have been found in}} otter scat in some regions, although most otter dietary studies in areas where otters and <b>beaver</b> are sympatric do not show them to be regular predators of beavers (despite the claims of fur-trappers that otters frequently hunt beavers) and perhaps only young <b>beaver</b> kits may be attacked.|$|E
5|$|River otters often {{reside in}} <b>beaver</b> ponds. Encounters between otters and beavers are not {{necessarily}} hostile. In Idaho, otters and beavers were recorded in the same <b>beaver</b> lodge simultaneously on three separate occasions. The otters may compete with the American mink (Mustela vison) for resources. In Alaska, the two species living in marine environments indicate niche separation through resource partitioning, probably related to the swimming abilities of these mustelids.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Turnpike {{begins at}} the Ohio state line in Lawrence County, beyond which it {{continues}} west as the Ohio Turnpike. From the state line, the turnpike heads southeast as a four-lane freeway designated as I-76 through the rural area south of New Castle.

5|$|The episode finalizes several {{important}} plot strands {{of the second}} season. Together, Keith and Vinnie Van Lowe track down Woody Goodman and arrest him. Veronica imagines graduation if Lilly had not been murdered, and then actually graduates. Jackie reveals her true past to Wallace before leaving him finally. Veronica learns that <b>Beaver</b> {{was responsible for the}} bus crash and gave her chlamydia after he raped her. <b>Beaver</b> explodes the plane with Woody Goodman on it. Logan comes up to the roof and attacks <b>Beaver.</b> Afterwards, <b>Beaver</b> commits suicide by jumping {{off the top of the}} building. Aaron is murdered by Clarence Wiedman, and Duncan was the person responsible for the attack. Veronica and Keith plan to go to New York, but due to a business offer from Kendall, Keith misses their flight.|$|E

5|$|Veronica asks <b>Beaver</b> {{how she got}} chlamydia—Woody had it, and <b>Beaver</b> {{transmitted}} it to her {{the night}} she was raped (revealing that he, not Duncan, raped her). <b>Beaver</b> is about {{to blow up the}} plane that has both Woody and Keith on it. <b>Beaver</b> pushes a button, and there is a flash in midair. <b>Beaver</b> tases Veronica before Logan appears, having read the text to Mac. The two steal Beaver's gun, and he ends up committing suicide instead of facing the consequences of his actions. Aaron and Kendall (Charisma Carpenter) are in bed, and while she is in the shower, Clarence Weidman (Christopher B. Duncan) appears and shoots him in the head. The scene moves to Australia, where we learn that Duncan organized the murder. Jackie meets Wallace and tells him that she {{had to go back to}} New York, where she is actually from, in order to care for her two-year-old son, whom she left with her mother, when she came to Neptune to reconnect with Terrence. Veronica learns that Keith is alive—he was not ever on the plane, but Woody was. Kendall receives $8 million, as Cassidy basically gave her the money as part of her plan. Veronica and Logan (Jason Dohring) rekindle their relationship. Kendall makes Keith a business proposal, and as a result, he misses their plane flight to New York.|$|E
