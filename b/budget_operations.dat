40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of {{structural}} power, i. e. horizontal subunit power, on resource allocation at the campus level within a major multicampus university system. The research design was primarily descriptive through the use of a case study approach employing cross sectional and longitudinal data. The case study institution was the University of North Carolina system, which is comprised of sixteen campuses. Both perceptual and archival data were collected. The independent variables, the determinants of power, were grant and contract funding, FTE graduate students, and FTE undergraduate students. The dependent variables constituted the measures of structural power, and included salary increase <b>budgets,</b> <b>operations</b> <b>budgets,</b> the combined salary and <b>operations</b> <b>budgets,</b> and the perceptual power ratings of the campus. ^ Multiple regression was the statistical procedure used to analyze the archival variables. Within each campus, the determinants of power were regressed on each of the three measures of power. Descriptive analysis was used with the perceptual data which were collected by a questionnaire completed by U. N. C. campus administrators. ...|$|R

50|$|As {{the title}} indicates, {{the speed of}} {{filtration}} is changed in the slow sand filter, however, the biggest difference between slow and rapid sand filter, is that {{the top layer of}} sand is biologically active, as microbial communities are introduced to the system. The recommended and usual depth of the filter is 0.9 to 1.5 meters. Microbial layer is formed within 10-20 days {{from the start of the}} operation. During the process of filtration, raw water can percolate through the porous sand medium, stopping and trapping organic material, bacteria, viruses and cysts such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium. The regeneration procedure for slow sand filters is called scraping and is used to mechanically remove the dried out particles on the filter. However, this process can also be done under water, depending on the individual system. Another limiting factor for the water being treated is turbidity, which is for slow sand filters defined to be 10 NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units). Slow sand filters are a good option for limited <b>budget</b> <b>operations</b> as the filtration is not using any chemicals and requires little or no mechanical assistance. However, because of a continuous growing population in communities, slow sand filters are being replaced for rapid sand filters, mostly due to the running period length.|$|E
