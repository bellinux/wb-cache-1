50|$|Like {{many other}} large pelagic visual predators, such as {{swordfish}} and <b>big-eye</b> <b>tuna,</b> they exhibit vertical behavior. Based on those caught off the Hawaiian coast, squid and krill {{make up the}} bulk of their diet, though they also consume small fish. Those caught along the Patagonian Shelf also showed a narrow range of prey, the most common of which was the deepwater onychotenhid squid (Moroteuthis ingens).|$|E
50|$|It is a {{pelagic fish}} with a {{worldwide}} distribution. While {{it is common}} to locations such as Hawaii and west Africa, it remains uncommon in others, including the Mediterranean.In the places where L. guttatus is prevalent, it is not a target of fishing, though it does represent an important commercial component of bycatch. It is common in restaurants in Hawaii. In Hawaiian longline fisheries, it is generally caught on deep sets targeting <b>big-eye</b> <b>tuna.</b> In 2005, the fish caught numbered 13,332. In areas where the fish is uncommon, such as the Mediterranean, its prevalence is increasing. Some researchers believe this a result of climate change.Much is still unknown about the distribution, interactions, life histories, and preferred habitats of this fish and other medium to large-sized pelagic fishes.|$|E
40|$|VAR {{models have}} been used to {{describe}} the dynamic relationships among market price, Japanese harvest, import-from-Taiwan, and import-from-Korea for frozen <b>Big-Eye</b> <b>tuna</b> and Yellow-Fin tuna markets in Japan. It is found that tuna imports from South Korea exert more significant effects on Japan market prices than import-from-Taiwan. Demand and Price Analysis, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
40|$|Tuna {{fishing grounds}} in {{relation}} to hydrographic conditions were studied from the data obtained during the HOE (1960 - 64). The most abundant catch of the yellowfin tuna {{was found in the}} equatorial countercurrent area and in the south equatorial current areas. The Indian Ocean central water area and subtropical convergence area (75 Â°E) formed good ground for albacore tuna. The <b>big-eye</b> <b>tuna</b> occurred in subtropical convergence area with the maximum concentration of fishes along the marginal areas. The results indicate that the upwelling areas are favourable for tuna fishing in the equatorial zone...|$|E
40|$|Pelagic fish {{schools are}} thought to show a general pattern of {{dispersion}} at night and aggregation within schools during the day. This pattern is often accepted as the major rule driving {{most of the other}} physiological, biological and ecological processes. Foraging on mobile prey, for instance, is assumed to be enhanced by schooling behaviour. Current theory assumes then that foraging is only possible for obligatory gregarious predatory fish from dawn to dusk. However, offshore mesopelagic communities perform vertical migrations and are out of reach for most oceanic pelagic predators during the day (with the exception of some apex predators, e. g. swordfish or <b>big-eye</b> <b>tuna).</b> To investigate how fish may overcome this apparent contradiction, we studied the 3 -dimensional spatial strategy of the South Pacific jack mackerel Trachurus murphyi according to the abiotic and biotic conditions of the habitat. Data came from acoustic surveys performed in central Chile in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Our results show that the jack mackerel distribution was driven by prey during the night when foraging, and related to the hydrology when resting during the day in {{the upper part of the}} oxycline. Fish were more aggregated at night than during the day, probably because jack mackerel cycles of schooling behaviour depend primarily on prey availability. This 'atypical' behaviour could be an adaptation of gregarious pelagic fish to an oceanic ecosystem. Fish schooling behaviour is not necessarily driven directly by the diel cycle; rather, it can be functional and depends on prey availability...|$|E
40|$|Since 1952, the Tunny Catch Fluctuation {{at the sea}} fronts {{spreading}} {{over the}} both South & Northward of the sea fronts off the Mangoli and Taliabu Islands belonging to the Sula Islands lying eastward of the Celebes Island has investigated by {{the crew of the}} Kagoshima-maru, Training ship of Kagoshima University, {{as a part of the}} fixed researching plan. After making some researches according to the features derived from the regional and seasonal devisions, the following results were obtained. (1) It was in Winter and at the North side of the sea front that the Fishing Rate per 100 hooks reached its maximum at the figure of 6. 0 %; and the next one was observed, in Summer, at the Southern Sea Front, at the figure of 5. 8 %. (2) At the southern sea fronts, an abundant appearance of <b>Big-eye</b> <b>tuna</b> (38 %) was observed, the fish body being large, 30 % of those fish caught having the trunk-length more than 141 ~ 150 cm and body-weight more than 60 kg. At the northern sea front, in winter, the appearance of Marlin's reached 33. 7 % of the total, main species of which being Sail Fish. (3) The main sources of the Catch are, except the Summer Season at the southern sea front, composed of Yellow-fin tuna. (4) Through both Summer and Winter, good catch percentage was seen at the southern sea front along the water-line about 20 miles off the seaside of Taliabu Island. (5) At the Southern Sea Front, about 25 miles off the seaside and in case of the Northern Sea Front, about 30 miles off, the Drift-Line could not help being overwhelmed by the running waves, and this showed the existence of a Tide current. The detailed Sea condition of these fronts should be reported in the next paper...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to evaluate the influence of ice storage on the raw materials {{for the production of}} high quality dried fish products in solar tunnel dryer by determining organoleptic, biochemical and bacteriological aspects. Fresh fish samples of silver jew fish, Bombay duck, <b>big-eye</b> <b>tuna,</b> Chinese pomfret and ribbon fish were collected from the landing centre of Cox`s Bazar and stored in ice for 13 days. During the storage period, required quantity of fish samples were taken out every three days for drying in a Hohenheim type solar tunnel dryer. The quality of the raw materials during storage and corresponding dried products produced in the dryer were evaluated. One day ice stored raw materials exhibited excellent quality on the basis of odour, colour, appearance and consistency of flesh. However, the overall organoleptic qualities of all samples were acceptable conditions up to 10 days of ice storage. Four days ice stored raw materials produced excellent quality of dried products in the solar dryer, while the dried products produced from 10 days of ice stored fishes were also found acceptable qualities judged by their characteristic colour, odour, texture, infestation and broken pieces. There were little or no changes in initial moisture content of 70. 5 to 89. 1 % in raw materials during 13 days of ice storage. The initial total volatile base, peroxide value and aerobic plate count of the raw materials were 2. 37 to 5. 15 mg N (100 g) - 1, 1. 27 to 2. 81 m eq kg - 1 oil and 2. 75 x 10 2 to 2. 0 x 10 3 CFU g - 1, respectively, which increased considerably beyond the acceptable limits after 13 days of ice storage. The moisture content of the dried products prepared from various days of ice stored fish samples were in the range of 15. 9 to 16. 4 % which were within the acceptable limit. The TVB-N, peroxide and APC values of the dried products produced from up to 10 days of ice stored raw materials were found within the limit of acceptable levels, which increased beyond the acceptable limits when raw materials stored up to 13 days in ice were used to produce solar tunnel dried fish products...|$|E
