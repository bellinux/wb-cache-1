5000|$|There are {{therapeutics}} used clinically {{which can}} effect {{the activity of}} P-type calcium channels. However, the primary target of these therapeutics are not thought to be P-type channels. For example, calcium antagonists, which are used to treat coronary heart disease, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmia, act by inhibiting L-type or T-type calcium channels. Some of these calcium antagonists include verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, <b>benidipine,</b> cilnidipine, nicardipine, and barnidipine. Although their main target is not P-type channels, these calcium antagonists also act to block the function of P-type channels. Moreover, flunarizine is another calcium antagonist {{which is used to}} treat migraines. Its main targets are voltage-gated calcium channels and sodium channels. Flunarizine inhibits the P-type channels that are located in the neocortical slices. It works to inhibit the inward flux of calcium. The migraines that it helps to prevent are due to mutations within the [...] "cacna1a" [...] gene of the P-type channel subunit. Also, compounds that block P-type channels are shown to help with seizures. Epileptic seizures are caused by increased neurotransmission, which is partially a result of P-type channels. Compounds such as levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine are known to block the P-type channels, which have helped to decrease the occurrence of seizures. Overall, there are various non-selective calcium channel blockers that help alleviate symptoms of hypertension, schizophrenia, cardiac arrhythmia, epilepsy, pain, asthma, bradycardia, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease. Although many of the therapeutic compounds' main target is not P-type channels, further research needs to determine if the clinical effects of these compounds are also influenced by the P-type channel blockage.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), an atherogenic {{component}} of oxidized low-density lipoprotein, {{has been shown}} to induce the attenuation of endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation. Although <b>benidipine,</b> a dihydropyridine-calcium channel blocker, is known to have endothelial protective effects, the effects of <b>benidipine</b> on LPC-induced endothelial dysfunction remain unknown. We examined the effects of <b>benidipine</b> on the impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by LPC. Methods <b>Benidipine</b> was administered orally to rats and aortas were then isolated. Aortic rings were treated with LPC and endothelial functions were then evaluated. Additionally, the effects of <b>benidipine</b> on intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +] i) and membrane fluidity altered by LPC in primary cultured rat aortic endothelial cells were examined. [Ca 2 +] i was measured using the fluorescent calcium indicator fura- 2. Membrane fluidity was monitored by measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Results Treatment with LPC impaired endothelial function. <b>Benidipine</b> prevents the impairment of relaxation induced by LPC. Acetylcholine elicited an increase in [Ca 2 +] i in fura- 2 loaded endothelial cells. The increase in [Ca 2 +] i was suppressed after exposure to LPC. Plasma membrane fluidity increased following incubation with LPC. <b>Benidipine</b> inhibited the LPC-induced increase in membrane fluidity and impairment of increase in [Ca 2 +] i. Conclusion These results suggest that <b>benidipine</b> inhibited LPC-induced endothelial dysfunction by maintaining increase in [Ca 2 +] i. <b>Benidipine</b> possesses membrane stabilization properties in LPC-treated endothelial cells. It is speculated that the preservation of membrane fluidity by <b>benidipine</b> {{may play a role in}} the retainment of calcium mobilization. The present findings may provide new insights into the endothelial protective effects of <b>benidipine.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives：This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the appropriate dose and dose-dependent effect of <b>benidipine</b> hydrochloride, a Ca＋＋-channel blocker, in patients with mild–moderate essential hypertension. Material and Methods：Benidipine was administered in 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg once daily with 1 month interval in 41 hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressure over 90 mmHg and systolic blood pressure from 140 to 210 mmHg. Blood pressure, heart rate, subjective symptoms and adverse effects were checked every 4 weeks after <b>benidipine</b> administration. Laboratory examinations were performed before and after <b>benidipine</b> administration. Results：The dose-dependent, antihypertensive effect of <b>benidipine</b> was evaluated in 41 patients. The blood pressure significantly reduced from 166 ± 15 mmHg/ 103 ± 7 mmHg to 13815 mmHg/ 88 ± 11 mmHg at 12 weeks administration of <b>benidipine</b> and overall effective rate was 95 %. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure was reduced significantly in proportion to dose of <b>benidipine</b> (p< 0. 0001). Antihypertensive effect was prominent at 4 mg of <b>benidipine.</b> The heart rate was not affected by <b>benidipine.</b> No significant laboratory changes were observed.

40|$|Aldosterone is {{implicated in}} the {{pathogenesis}} of several cardiovascular diseases, including ischemia reperfusion (I/R) and myocardial infarction, and also causes oxidative stress and inflammation in cardiovascular systems. <b>Benidipine,</b> a long-acting T-and L-type calcium channel blocker, reduces infarct size following myocardial I/R in rabbits. <b>Benidipine</b> also inhibits the production of aldosterone in vitro. However, the precise mechanism of this phenomenon in vivo remains unknown. We therefore evaluated whether benedipine has a beneficial role through the regulation of oxidative stress in myocardial I/R. C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were subjected to 30 min of left ascending coronary I/R. <b>Benidipine</b> was administered orally at 3 mg kg - 1 daily for 3 weeks without any changes in hemodynamic variables. <b>Benidipine</b> significantly reduced infarction size (13. 4 ± 2. 5 %) compared with controls (25. 5 ± 3. 6 %). Urinary 8 -hydroxy- 2 ′ deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG), a marker of oxidative DNA damage, increased significantly after I/R. I/R induced increases in 8 -OHdG were significantly lower with <b>benidipine.</b> Local myocardial 8 -OHdG was also elevated in I/R, but this augmentation was significantly suppressed with <b>benidipine.</b> The plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) significantly increased 2 days after I/R and remained elevated at least 7 days after I/R. Treatment with <b>benidipine</b> significantly decreased I/R-induced elevation of the PAC.

Adult male rats were subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by 3 h of reperfusion. Rats were randomized to receive either vehicle or <b>benidipine</b> (10 μg kg− 1, i. v.) 10 min before reperfusion.

Background. <b>Benidipine</b> protects endothelial cells against ischemia and reperfusion injury in hearts. Methods and Results. In open chest dogs, coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) of the left anterior descending coronary artery was reduced so that CBF decreased to one-third of the control CBF, and thereafter CPP was maintained constant (103 ± 8 to 42 ± 1 mmHg). Both fractional shortening (FS: 6. 1 ± 1. 0 %) and lactate extraction ratio (LER: − 41 ± 4 %) decreased. Ten minutes after the onset of an intracoronary infusion of <b>benidipine</b> (100 ng/kg/min), CBF increased from 32 ± 1 to 48 ± 4 ml/ 100 g/min during 20 min without changing CPP (42 ± 2 mmHg).

40|$|Ischaemia/reperfusion causes {{intracellular}} calcium overloading in cardiac cells. Administration {{of calcium}} antagonists reduces myocardial infarct size. Recent {{in vitro studies}} have demonstrated that calcium plays a critical role in the signal transduction pathway leading to apoptosis. However, whether or not calcium antagonists may reduce myocardial apoptosis induced by ischaemia-reperfusion, and thus decrease myocardial infarction, has not been directly investigated. The present study investigated the effects of <b>benidipine,</b> an L-type calcium channel blocker, on myocardial infarct size, apoptosis, necrosis and cardiac functional recovery in rabbits subjected to myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (MI/R, 45 [*]min/ 240 [*]min). Ten minutes prior to coronary occlusion, rabbits were treated with vehicle or <b>benidipine</b> (10 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 or 3 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. v.). In the vehicle-treated group, MI/R caused cardiomyocyte apoptosis as evidenced by DNA ladder formation and TUNEL positive nuclear staining (12. 2 ± 1. 1 %). Treatment with 10 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 <b>benidipine</b> lowered blood pressure, decreased myocardial apoptosis (6. 2 ± 0. 8 %, P< 0. 01 vs vehicle) and necrosis, reduced infarct size (20 ± 2. 3 % vs 49 ± 2. 6 %, P< 0. 01), and improved cardiac functional recovery after reperfusion.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to clarify whether azelnidipine might have beneficial effects on autonomic functions, and whether such beneficial effects might affect the vascular functions (i. e., arterial stiffness and endothelial function). Methods and resultsThis study with a cross-over design was conducted in 21 hypertensive patients (65 ± 9 years old) being treated with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) other than azelnidipine or <b>benidipine</b> (i. e., during the study period, the CCB was switched to either azelnidipine 16 mg/day or <b>benidipine</b> 4 mg/day, administered alternately for 8 weeks each). Blood examinations were conducted and the heart rate variability, baro-receptor sensitivity (BRS), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) in the brachial artery were measured after treatment with each of the two drugs. While the blood pressure levels decreased to a similar degree after both treatments, the BRS (8. 8 ± 5. 5 ms/mmHg vs. 6. 4 ± 2. 9 ms/mmHg, p< 0. 01) and high-frequency power component (HF: 139 ± 152 ms 2 /Hz vs. 88 ± 97 ms 2 /Hz) were higher after treatment with azelnidipine than after treatment with <b>benidipine</b> (p< 0. 05).

Finally, we concluded that there was a synergy when fluconazole combined with the four tested CCBs against resistant strains, with fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) < 0. 5, but no interaction against sensitive strains (FICI = 0. 56 ~ 2). The mechanism studies revealed that fluconazole plus amlodipine caused down-regulating of CNA 1, CNB 1 (encoding calcineurin) and YVC 1 (encoding calcium channel protein in vacuole membrane) ...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundWe {{compared}} {{the efficacy of}} once-daily treatment with nifedipine CR 40 mg (NR) and twice-daily treatment with <b>benidipine</b> 4 mg (BD) in patients with coronary spastic angina (CSA) registered in 3 cardiovascular institutes in Tokyo. Methods and resultsCSA was diagnosed by an ischemic ST change during Holter ECG monitoring or drug-induced test. Thirty patients were randomly allocated to either NR or BD group. The number of symptomatic attacks and the total frequency of short-acting nitrates were examined based on the data in diaries written by patients. There {{were no significant differences}} in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. The median number (25 – 75 % quartile) of attacks per week was significantly decreased in NR group, i. e., 1. 0 (0. 8 – 2. 0) at baseline, 0. 0 (0. 0 – 1. 0) after 4 weeks of treatment, and 0. 0 (0. 0 – 0. 0) after 8 weeks of treatment (P= 0. 0093, P= 0. 0002, Wilcoxon's rank-sum test). No significant decrease was observed in BD, i. e. 1. 0 (0. 5 – 2. 0) at baseline, 1. 3 (0. 0 – 3. 0) after 4 weeks, and 0. 0 (0. 0 – 1. 0) after 8 weeks. The number of attacks was fewer in NR than in BD group (P= 0. 074, P= 0. 015, U-test for difference). ConclusionOnce-daily treatment with NR 40 mg was more effective than twice-daily treatment with BD in the prevention of CSA attacks...|$|E
