5|$|Due to {{subsequent}} vowel loss many Mayan languages now show complex consonant clusters at {{both ends}} of syllables. Following the reconstruction of Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the Proto-Mayan language had the following sounds. It has been suggested that proto-Mayan was a tonal language, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> four different contemporary Mayan languages have tone (Yucatec, Uspantek, San Bartolo Tzotzil and Mocho'), but since these languages each can be shown to have innovated tone in different ways, Campbell considers this unlikely.|$|E

Based on this view, the Achaeans under Attarsiya may have formed some kind of alliance which included several Mycenaean kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|A late 15th century legenda nova {{claimed that}} Henry {{had come to}} Sweden in the retinue of papal legate Nicholas Breakspear, the later Pope Adrian IV, and {{appointed}} as the Bishop of Uppsala by him. Even though legenda nova states 1150 as {{the year of the}} crusade, it is certain from other sources that Nicholas really was in Sweden in 1153. It is not known whether this was just an inference by the writer, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> also Nicholas was an Englishman. However, there is no information about anyone called as Henry accompanying the legate in any source describing the visit, nor him appointing a new bishop in Uppsala. Another claim by legenda nova was that Henry was translated to Turku cathedral already in 1154, which certainly was false since the cathedral was built only in the 1290s. In the late 16th century, Bishop Paulus Juusten claimed that Henry had been the Bishop of Uppsala for two years before the crusade. Based on these postulates, early 20th-century historians assembled 1155 as the year of the crusade and 1156 as the year of Henry's death. Historians from different centuries have also suggested various other years from 1150 to 1158.|$|E
5|$|Barea {{continued}} {{playing in}} the backup position at the 2008 Centrobasket tournament. He entered the final round leading the event in points, after scoring 31 and 30 points against Panama and the Dominican Republic. In the last two games, Barea {{was placed in the}} team's starting lineup. Puerto Rico won the tournament's gold medal by defeating the United States Virgin Islands. Following this game, Barea received the event's Most Valuable Player award. In 2009, the Mavericks didn't give Barea permission to play in the FIBA Americas Championship. This decision was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the player had undergone surgery on his left shoulder during the post-season. Barea returned to international play at the 2010 Centrobasket, serving as the national team's starting point guard, Arroyo was in turn reassigned to the regular shooting guard position. Puerto Rico won its group, defeating Panama in semifinals and the Dominican Republic in the final to win the gold medal. Barea had averages of 13.8 points per game and led CentroBasket in assists per game with 7.0, earning him inclusion in the tournament's All-Star Team.|$|E

5|$|Before commencing {{the designs}} for the {{characters}} in Devil May Cry 4, character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa consulted with {{several members of the}} staff that had worked in the series previously, in order to become familiar with previous elements. The characters were designed in order to emphasize their moves, which made the staff controlling their motions vital in the design. Some of the demonic forms of the antagonists in Devil May Cry 4 resemble angels. These characters were designed to be attractive to the game's audience while providing a contrast when compared to other demons in the game. Yoshikawa noted that several of the boss characters presented some difficulty when creating them, but that Nero's design {{was one of the biggest}} challenges he had experienced in his career, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the character would have to be accepted by the public and fit in the series' universe.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Camille Flammarion {{noted that}} the comets 1862 III and 1889 III had aphelia of 47 and 49AU, respectively, {{suggesting}} that they might mark the orbital radius of an unknown planet that had dragged them into an elliptical orbit. Astronomer George Forbes concluded {{on the basis of}} this evidence that two planets must exist beyond Neptune. He calculated, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> four comets possessed aphelia at around 100AU and a further six with aphelia clustered at around 300AU, the orbital elements of a pair of hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets. These elements concorded suggestively with those made independently by another astronomer named David Peck Todd, suggesting to many that they might be valid. However, sceptics argued that the orbits of the comets involved were still too uncertain to produce meaningful results. George Forbes is today considered to be the first describing Planet Nine.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the French chemist Georges Urbain {{separated}} Marignac's ytterbia {{into two}} components: neoytterbia and lutecia. Neoytterbia later {{became known as}} the element ytterbium, and lutecia {{became known as the}} element lutetium. The Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach independently isolated these elements from ytterbia at about the same time, but he called them aldebaranium and cassiopeium; the American chemist Charles James also independently isolated these elements at about the same time. Urbain and Welsbach accused each other of publishing results based on the other party. The Commission on Atomic Mass, consisting of Frank Wigglesworth Clarke, Wilhelm Ostwald, and Georges Urbain, which was then responsible for the attribution of new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the separation of lutetium from Marignac's ytterbium was first described by Urbain. After Urbain's names were recognized, neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium.|$|E

5|$|New {{research}} indicates that many white dwarfs—at least in certain types of galaxies—may not approach that limit by way of accretion. It has been postulated {{that at least some}} of the white dwarfs that become supernovae attain the necessary mass by colliding with one another. It may be that in elliptical galaxies such collisions are the major source of supernovae. This hypothesis is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the X-rays produced by those galaxies are 30 to 50 times less than what is expected to be produced by type Ia supernovas of that galaxy as matter accretes on the white dwarf from its encircling companion. It has been concluded that no more than 5 percent of the supernovae in such galaxies could be created by the process of accretion onto white dwarfs. The significance of this finding is that there could be two types of supernovae, which could mean that the Chandrasekhar limit might not always apply in determining when a white dwarf goes supernova, given that two colliding white dwarfs could have a range of masses. This in turn would confuse efforts to use exploding white dwarfs as standard candles in determining distances.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 2010 the FIFA Emergency Committee {{suspended}} the Salvadoran Football Federation (FESFUT) {{on account of}} government interference. This decision by FIFA was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the statutes ratified by the FESFUT general assembly in August 2009 had not been formally entered in the country's official register, {{and that the government}} had failed to acknowledge the authority of the Normalisation Committee set up to represent FESFUT. Consequently, FIFA considered that it was not possible for FESFUT to organise the general assembly in line with the action plan that had been drawn up, and suspended FESFUT. For the suspension to be lifted, Salvadoran authorities needed to recognize the legitimacy of the Normalisation Committee of the Salvadoran Football Association. The suspension was lifted by May 28. By FIFA lifting the suspension, La Selecta was once again allowed to participate in international tournaments at both club and national levels. El Salvador's under-21 team qualified for the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games (CAC) tournament in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico. However, CONCACAF decided to suspend football at the 2010 CAC shortly thereafter. El Salvador was also able to participate in the qualifying tournament for the 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|E

Originally from Guatemala, where he had served in various political positions, Ramírez was {{also a member of the}} Philadelphia Philosophical Society. The Diario Económico de Puerto Rico, a newspaper specialized in the archipelago's economy, noted that during the time banknotes of all denominations were still being forged in large quantities. The publication claimed that the counterfeits were most likely produced in other locations of the Caribbean, this was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> only one royal press existed in Puerto Rico. However, modern researchers maintain that the copies could have been produced locally in a clandestine manner. This is based on a report that emphasizes that the designs of false 8-real notes were crude and that the ink used spread when touched, something that wouldn't be possible if produced elsewhere, particularly because the ink would dry in the voyage between countries. During this time, paper notes began disappearing and the stated recurred to renewing old pieces.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} final pre-bowl game Bowl Championship Series standings were {{released}} on December 4, Auburn was among several teams disgruntled with the system. One of these was California, which only lost to top-ranked USC, but was denied a bid to the prestigious Rose Bowl after Texas vaulted it in the rankings despite having the same record. The Golden Bears were forced to attend the less-attractive Holiday Bowl instead. The Auburn Tigers, meanwhile, had completed their first 12-win regular season and won their first conference championship in 15 years, but in the final BCS rankings, Auburn was third, behind USC and Oklahoma. It {{was the first time}} since the creation of the BCS in 1998 that three major-conference college football teams were undefeated at the conclusion of the regular season. Some pundits and fans considered Auburn's failure to reach the championship game to be <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the Tigers had started with a lower ranking at the beginning of the season. The Tigers had been ranked 17th at the beginning of the season, while USC had been ranked first and Oklahoma second, the same spots they occupied at the end of the regular season.|$|E
5|$|The International Commission on Atomic Weights, {{which was}} then {{responsible}} for the attribution of new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the separation of lutetium from Marignac's ytterbium was first described by Urbain; after Urbain's names were recognized, neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium. Until the 1950s, some German-speaking chemists called lutetium by Welsbach's name, cassiopeium; in 1949, the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium. The reason for this was that Welsbach's 1907 samples of lutetium had been pure, while Urbain's 1907 samples only contained traces of lutetium. This later misled Urbain into thinking that he had discovered element 72, which he named celtium, which was actually very pure lutetium. The later discrediting of Urbain's work on element 72 led to a reappraisal of Welsbach's work on element 71, so that the element was renamed to cassiopeium in German-speaking countries for some time. Charles James, who {{stayed out of the}} priority argument, worked on a much larger scale and possessed the largest supply of lutetium at the time. Pure lutetium metal was first produced in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The airline started {{negotiating}} a charter contract {{agreement with the}} Danish tour operator Spies Rejser in July 1970. Trans Polar offered the operator the use of two Boeing 720s for 55 million Danish krone (DKK), 10 million lower than the incumbent Scanair was bidding, which would allow Spies to transport 140,000 of their annual 250,000 passengers. As the first aircraft was bound to existing operations, Trans Polar would have to procure two additional aircraft for the contract, as well as receive operating permission in Denmark. Trans Polar and Spies signed a contract in mid-August for one weekly service from Copenhagen to Gran Canaria, while another weekly contract was awarded to Maersk Air. Negotiations for the main contract started on 5 September; Scanair had stated a minimum price it could accept, largely <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Spies {{did not have an}} alternative operator. The successful negotiations with Trans Polar also included an agreement with Spantax, who each could offer Spies 70,000 seats for the season. The contract brought annual revenue of DKK25 million to Trans Polar. To fly the operations, two ex-Aer Lingus Boeing 720s were registered on 16 October. The company later signed agreements with the Danish tour operators Karavan-rejser and Danmarks Internasjonale Studentkomite (DIS).|$|E
