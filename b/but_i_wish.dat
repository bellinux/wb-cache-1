Club found the episode to have a [...] "fantastic premise for a Peter Griffin adventure" [...] but went on to state that he gives the episode [...] "points for a strong first half, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> that the writers had pushed {{themselves}} {{a little harder to}} make this one go the distance." [...] Ramsey Isler of IGN reiterated his own enjoyment of the premise {{of the episode}}, but went on to state, [...] "While I can appreciate the point that good comedy does take a certain degree of wit and cleverness, this just wasn't a very satisfying end to an idea that had so much potential." [...] In a much more positive review, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the underuse of cutaways, going on to note, [...] "Reducing the reliance on cutaways seems to be the continuing trend for the series, and I think it's a good move [...] It forces smarter writing, and creates a better narrative structure." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 9, 2012, it was {{announced}} that Odom had parted ways with the Mavericks. Instead of releasing him, the team listed Odom inactive {{for the remainder of the}} season.

2500|$|Henry the Young King died, aged 28, in {{the summer}} of 1183, {{during the course of a}} {{campaign}} in Limousin against his father and his brother Richard. He had just completed a pillage of local monasteries to raise money to pay his mercenaries. He contracted dysentery at the beginning of June. Weakening fast, he was taken to Martel, near Limoges. It was clear to his household that he was dying on 7 June, when he was confessed and received the last rites. As a token of his penitence for his war against his father, he prostrated himself naked on the floor before a crucifix. He made a testament and, since he had taken a crusader's vow, he gave his cloak to his friend William Marshal, with the plea that he should take the cloak (presumably with the crusader's cross stitched to it) to the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. On his deathbed, he reportedly asked to be reconciled to his father, but King Henry, fearing a trick, refused to see him. He died on 11 June, clasping a ring his father had sent instead as a sign of his forgiveness. After his death, his father is said to have exclaimed: [...] "He cost me much, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> he had lived to cost me more." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the Chicago game, 1,000 {{students}} {{gathered at}} the Athens Theater in Ann Arbor where they listened to a play-by-play account of the game as it was transmitted by telegraph from Chicago. [...] Michigan gains were met with cheering. [...] When Widman's touchdown run was announced, [...] "It {{seemed as if the}} whole assembly was thrown into the air by a volcanic eruption. Men threw their hats and coats at one another and hugged and danced in the aisles for fully ten minutes." [...] After the game, the crowd marched through the streets to President James B. Angell's home. [...] President Angell greeted the crowd with a broad smile and said, [...] "I congratulate you on the success of the Michigan team in Chicago this afternoon. [...] It is a great victory, and we owe much to the men who have won the laurels of our victory from the brow of our sister institution of learning. [...] It has been said that I am opposed to the game, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> to say that I, too, used to play in college. [...] In those days, however, we played the Herschberger game, and used to kick the ball instead of the man.

2500|$|A {{report in}} November 2010 {{suggested}} that Hatcher, along with co-star Felicity Huffman, would be quitting Desperate Housewives, but ABC denied the claim. Hatcher later addressed the rumors of her departure from Desperate Housewives, saying that [...] "here {{are not enough}} adjectives to describe how stupid, off base, and ridiculously untrue this is". However, after the show concluded in 2012, media sources revealed an apparent rift with her co-stars. It has been widely speculated that the cast did not get along well with Hatcher. Eva Longoria, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross, and Vanessa Williams gave thank-you gifts to the crew from the show which included a message with their names subscribed at the end, and Hatcher's name was distinctly absent. TV Guide source, William Keck, revealed that [...] "something went down" [...] between Hatcher and the cast that caused a split and also observed how Hatcher would physically distance herself from the others during breaks in filming. On her end, Hatcher said to TV Guide that [...] "I will never disclose the true and complicated journey of us all, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> everyone on the show well." [...] Longoria denied any animosity saying to David Letterman, [...] "we all get along." [...] Remarkably, a friend of Longoria's revealed, to another media source, that Hatcher [...] "excluded herself {{from the rest of}} the cast from day one", and that she chose to end it all on a sad note, saying that [...] "doing the last press they will ever do for the show, the ladies stood united and were shocked when Teri simply didn't show up".|$|E
