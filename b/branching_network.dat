5|$|Mitochondria (and related structures) {{are found}} in all eukaryotes (except one—the Oxymonad Monocercomonoides sp.). Although {{commonly}} depicted as bean-like structures they form a highly dynamic network {{in the majority of}} cells where they constantly undergo fission and fusion. Mitochondria vary in number and location according to cell type. A single mitochondrion is often found in unicellular organisms. Conversely, numerous mitochondria {{are found in}} human liver cells, with about 1000–2000 mitochondria per cell, making up 1/5 of the cell volume. The population of all the mitochondria of a given cell constitutes the chondriome. The mitochondrial content of otherwise similar cells can vary substantially in size and membrane potential, with differences arising from sources including uneven partitioning at cell divisions, leading to extrinsic differences in ATP levels and downstream cellular processes. The mitochondria can be found nestled between myofibrils of muscle or wrapped around the sperm flagellum. Often, they form a complex 3D <b>branching</b> <b>network</b> inside the cell with the cytoskeleton. The association with the cytoskeleton determines mitochondrial shape, which can affect the function as well: different structures of the mitochondrial network may afford the population a variety of physical, chemical, and signalling advantages or disadvantages. Mitochondria in cells are always distributed along microtubules and the distribution of these organelles is also correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent evidence suggests that vimentin, one of the components of the cytoskeleton, is also critical to the association with the cytoskeleton.|$|E
500|$|The Roman {{physician}} Galen {{also argued}} {{for the importance of}} the brain, and theorized in some depth about how it might work. Galen traced out the anatomical relationships among brain, nerves, and muscles, demonstrating that all muscles in the body are connected to the brain through a <b>branching</b> <b>network</b> of nerves. He postulated that nerves activate muscles mechanically by carrying a mysterious substance he called pneumata psychikon, usually translated as [...] "animal spirits". Galen's ideas were widely known during the Middle Ages, but not much further progress came until the Renaissance, when detailed anatomical study resumed, combined with the theoretical speculations of René Descartes and those who followed him. Descartes, like Galen, thought of the nervous system in hydraulic terms. He believed that the highest cognitive functions are carried out by a non-physical res cogitans, but that the majority of behaviors of humans, and all behaviors of animals, could be explained mechanistically.|$|E

Similar from a {{physiological}} point of view, to the secretory glands which form the digestive fluids are those which furnish lubricating fluids, the lachrymal gland, and Harderian glands in the orbit internally to the eye, and posterior and anterior to it respectively, the sebaceous glands (oil glands) {{connected with the}} hair, and the anal and perineal glands. The secretions of excretory glands are removed from the body; chief among them are the sweat glands and kidneys. The sweat glands are microscopic tubular glands, terminating internally in a small coil (Figure VIII. s.g.) and are scattered thickly over the body, the water of their secretion being constantly removed by evaporation, and the small percentage of salt and urea remaining to accumulate as dirt, and the chief reasonable excuse for washing. The kidney structure is shown diagrammatically in Figure 5, Sheet 7. A great number of branching and straight looped, tubuli (little tubes) converge on an open space, the pelvis. Towards the outer layers (cortex) of the kidney, these tubuli terminate in little dilatations into which tangled knots of blood-vessels project: the dilatations are called Bowman's capsules (B.c.), and each coil of bloodvessel a glomerulus (gl.). In the capsules, water is drained from the blood; in the tubuli, urea and other salts in the urine are secreted from a <b>branching</b> <b>network</b> of vessels.|$|E
40|$|Despite recent {{innovations}} {{that might have}} reduced banks' reliance on brick-and-mortar branches for distributing retail financial services, the number of U. S. bank branches has continued to increase steadily over time. Further, an increasing percentage of these branches are held by banks with large <b>branch</b> <b>networks.</b> This paper assesses {{the implications of these}} developments by examining a series of simple branch performance measures and asking how these measures vary, on average, across institutions with different <b>branch</b> <b>network</b> sizes. The key findings are that banks with 100 to 500 <b>branches</b> (mid-sized <b>networks)</b> had lower bank-average deposits per branch and roughly equal volumes of small business loans per branch, but no reduction in net deposit costs, relative to banks with larger <b>branch</b> <b>networks.</b> When compared to banks with 100 or fewer <b>branches,</b> mid-sized <b>branch</b> <b>networks</b> had lower bank-average deposits and small business loan volume per branch, but had lower net deposit costs. The analysis shows no systematic relationship between <b>branch</b> <b>network</b> size and overall institutional profitability. The results imply that mid-sized <b>branch</b> <b>networks</b> may be at a competitive disadvantage, especially relative to the very largest <b>branch</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{amplification}} reaction initiates when multiple primer hexamers anneal to the template. When DNA synthesis {{proceeds to}} the next starting site, the polymerase displaces the newly produced DNA strand and continues its strand elongation. The strand displacement generates newly synthesized single stranded DNA template for more primers to anneal. Further primer annealing and strand displacement on the newly synthesized template results in a hyper-branched DNA network. The sequence debranching during amplification results in high yield of the products. To separate the DNA <b>branching</b> <b>network,</b> S1 nucleases are used to cleave the fragments at displacement sites. The nicks on the resulting DNA fragments are repaired by DNA polymerase I.|$|E

5000|$|Tight {{junctions}} {{are composed}} of a <b>branching</b> <b>network</b> of sealing strands, each strand acting independently from the others. Therefore, {{the efficiency of the}} junction in preventing ion passage increases exponentially with the number of strands.Each strand is formed from a row of transmembrane proteins embedded in both plasma membranes, with extracellular domains joining one another directly. Although more proteins are present, the major types are the claudins and the occludins. These associate with different peripheral membrane proteins such as ZO-1 located on the intracellular side of plasma membrane, which anchor the strands to the actin component of the cytoskeleton. [...] Thus, tight junctions join together the cytoskeletons of adjacent cells.|$|E
5000|$|... == Structure of the tracheae == After {{passing through}} a spiracle, air enters a {{longitudinal}} tracheal trunk, eventually diffusing throughout a complex, <b>branching</b> <b>network</b> of tracheal tubes that subdivides into smaller and smaller diameters and reaches {{every part of the}} body. At the end of each tracheal branch, a special cell (the tracheole) provides a thin, moist interface for the exchange of gasses between atmospheric air and a living cell. Oxygen in the tracheal tube first dissolves in the liquid of the tracheole and then diffuses into the cytoplasm of an adjacent cell. At the same time, carbon dioxide, produced as a waste product of cellular respiration, diffuses out of the cell and, eventually, out of the body through the tracheal system.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{decomposers}} of litter in many {{ecosystems are}} fungi. Unlike bacteria, which are unicellular organisms, most saprotrophic fungi grow as a <b>branching</b> <b>network</b> of hyphae. While bacteria {{are restricted to}} growing and feeding on the exposed surfaces of organic matter, fungi can use their hyphae to penetrate larger pieces of organic matter. Additionally, only wood-decay fungi have evolved the enzymes necessary to decompose lignin, a chemically complex substance found in wood. These two factors make fungi the primary decomposers in forests, where litter has high concentrations of lignin and often occurs in large pieces. Fungi decompose organic matter by releasing enzymes {{to break down the}} decaying material, after which they absorb the nutrients in the decaying material. [...] Hyphae used to break down matter and absorb nutrients are also used in reproduction. When two compatible fungi's hyphae grow close to each other, they will then fuse together for reproduction and form another fungus.|$|E
