40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the primary utility of travel (PUT) after data from the French National Travel Survey (FNTS) 2007 - 2008, to know how 'primary' actual trips are, or more exactly to what extent they yield each of three types of utility : utility of {{reaching}} a destination, utility of activities performed during the trip, and utility of the trip itself. For that, a twelve-fold typology of trips is created (PUT type). The paper provides one dimension statistics of all PUT questions in the FNTS, as well as the split of all trips <b>by</b> <b>PUT</b> type. Cross tabulations of <b>PUT</b> type <b>by</b> different <b>PUT</b> questions, age-gender groups, trip purpose and travel mode are also described. Finally, a generalized logistic model is estimated to explain the trip split <b>by</b> <b>PUT</b> type with respect to a number of explanatory variables at the household level, at the individual level, at the trip level. Many variables have a significant effect on the probability that a trip is of any of the twelve considered PUT types...|$|R

5|$|At the time, {{animals in}} zoos were {{typically}} held in poor conditions in small, cramped cages, and the Zoological Gardens presented no exception.

Children were carried around the park {{on the back of}} the zoo's elephant, giving it a rare opportunity for exercise. Even with these entertainments, the Zoological Gardens were eventually forced to admit defeat. The park was closed and the site sold to a property developer in 1857.
