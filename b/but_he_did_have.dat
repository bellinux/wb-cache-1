Pepys never remarried, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> a long-term housekeeper named Mary Skinner who was assumed by many of his contemporaries to be his mistress and sometimes referred to as Mrs. Pepys.

25|$|Garnett {{was drafted}} with the fifth overall {{pick in the}} 1995 NBA draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves, {{and became the first}} player to be drafted {{directly}} out of high school since 1975. Since joining the NBA for the 1989–90 season, the Timberwolves had not won more than 29 games in any season. In Garnett's rookie season, the Timberwolves {{were in the midst of}} a transition phase; they replaced Bill Blair with Flip Saunders as head coach early in the season, and made several trades. Garnett initially came off the bench in his rookie year, but moved into the starting lineup soon after Saunders became head coach. In his rookie year, Garnett and fellow newcomer Tom Gugliotta carried the scoring load. Garnett did not immediately leap to stardom as later prep-to-pro prospects such as Amar'e Stoudemire, LeBron James and Dwight Howard would, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> a very respectable rookie year. He averaged 10.4 points, 6.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game and was voted to the All-Rookie Second Team. Despite having some promising players, the Timberwolves suffered through their seventh consecutive sub-30 win season and failed to make the playoffs. At the time, Garnett was the youngest NBA player in history at 19 years and 11 months of age.|$|E
25|$|When the two {{submarines}} arrived {{they were}} off Mendoza Island (now Shenggao Island) {{at the entrance of}} the bay. The two then split up, L4 went to patrol around the entrance of the bay and Halahan ordered L5 to patrol within. Bias Bay is surrounded by rocks and that night there was a fleet of fishing junks sheltering inside and constantly moving around the anchorage. Both the rocks and the junks made it difficult for the British to monitor the area without being detected though they succeeded in doing so and on the morning of 20 October they encountered the Irene steaming off Cake Island. She had been taken over by at least eighteen pirates armed with automatic pistols. It was still dark so the L4 was surface cruising with a crew at the 4-inch (102-mm) gun and another pair at the vessel's searchlight. Lieutenant Halahan knew that torpedoes were not helpful in recapturing a pirate held ship <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> a 4-inch (102-mm) deck gun. Then the Irene was spotted so Halahan maneuvered his submarine into position for firing and when the order was given, the search light was turned on and the gun crew fired a blank warning shot at the steamer. When the shot was ignored a second live round was fired and it blew a hole straight through the ship and killed a pirate who was standing on deck.|$|E

500|$|On May 8, General Whiteside's militia brigade was mustered into federal service under Atkinson. Two days later, {{the militia}} and regulars began marching up the Rock River {{in pursuit of}} the British Band, with Governor Reynolds {{accompanying}} the expedition as a major general of militia. Atkinson allowed Reynolds, Whiteside, and the militiamen to take the lead while he brought up the rear with the regular soldiers. In what historian Patrick Jung calls a [...] "serious lapse in judgment", Atkinson directed the militia—his least trained and disciplined men—to [...] "move upon the Indians should they be within striking distance without waiting for my arrival". On May 12, the militiamen learned that Black Hawk's band was only twenty-five miles away. Reynolds wanted to send out a scouting force, but the cautious Whiteside insisted on waiting for Atkinson. Because most of the militia were now under U.S. Army command, Reynolds could not give them orders, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> two battalions of mounted militia under Major Isaiah Stillman that had not been federalized. In what would prove to be a controversial decision, Reynolds sent these 260 amateur citizen-soldiers forward to reconnoiter the British Band.|$|E
500|$|Oxbow drew post {{position}} {{five for}} the Haskell, carried the highest weight at 122 pounds, {{and was the}} second favorite in the race behind Verrazano. [...] Leading for {{the early part of}} the race, Oxbow was challenged for the lead by Verrazano at the three-quarter-mile marker, then weakened and finished fourth, earning another $60,000. Stevens felt something was wrong with Oxbow at the half-mile pole, later saying the horse [...] "didn’t feel like he did in any of the Triple Crown races", and Lukas stated the jockey [...] "kind of held" [...] Oxbow from that point on. Oxbow was pulled up soon after crossing the finish line, then his rider jumped off and removed the saddle when Oxbow failed to jog sound on the track. [...] The horse walked back to the barn without obvious sign of injury, and radiographs of his right front ankle revealed no fracture, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> a soft tissue injury to the area, described as a [...] "sprain". Of Oxbow's overall health, Lukas commented, [...] "he had a pretty set of X-rays. It's amazing. For a horse with that many , they were really clean." [...] Nonetheless, as a result of the soft tissue injury, Oxbow was taken out of races for the duration of the summer, and after three weeks of hand-walking at Saratoga was shipped home to Calumet in mid-August, with an announcement that he was not anticipated to run again in 2013. Lukas said: [...] "He's been a warrior and a hell of a nice horse for us and I don't want to do anything to jeopardize his future down the line." [...] On October 25, 2013, Calumet Farm announced the decision to retire Oxbow. Combined with his winnings in his two-year-old season, his lifetime race earnings were $1,243,500. [...] He stood at stud for the 2014 breeding season at [...] Taylor Made Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, for an introductory stud fee of $20,000. He closed out the year ranked 17th in earnings with $1,146,000 won in 2013. For the 2015 season he moves to Calumet Farms, where he joins seven other stallions, including English Channel, who sired 2014 Travers Stakes winner V.E. Day.|$|E
