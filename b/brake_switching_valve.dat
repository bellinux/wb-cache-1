40|$|Two {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatograph}} (HPLC) systems with a Rheodyne Model 7000 <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> {{for separation of}} D- and L-lactate in biological samples has been reported. However, since the <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> was rotated manually, so that only 10 samples could be determined within one day. For better efficiency, a circuit for rotating the <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> automatically, which is including mechanical units of motion, two timers, and electronic control units was designed. Total (D+L) -lactate fluorescent derivatives was separated from others by a TSKgel ODS- 80 Ts column, when the peak of lactate derivatives appeared in the chromatogram on the ODS column, the valve position was changed by switching and then the isolated lactate derivatives was introduced into the chiral column automatically. Then the D- and L- enantiomers were separated by the chiral column. The utility of the analyzer system was tested for the determination of chiral separation of urinary D, L-lactate in the mouse. It takes about 90 min to analyze one urine sample for a circulation. Before automation, we must turn the <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> manually when the signal shows up, so {{that there must be}} someone always standby and only about 10 samples could be analyzed within one day. With the designed automatic column-switching HPLC system, the <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> can be automatically turned at the setting time repeatedly and over 15 samples could be determined within one day.

30|$|Traditional drivers, such as motors, {{run through}} complex {{mechanisms}} [17]. Meanwhile pneumatic muscles {{have been widely}} used because of its simple assembly [18] and are mainly controlled by tracking control methods [19 – 21]. Several studies have performed on pneumatic muscles, mainly focusing on the modeling and control of pneumatic valves [22 – 24]. The precise pressure proportional valve is typically used to achieve output accuracy, but the cost is expensive and the flow rate of the pressure proportional valve is relatively small. Further, such setup is not suited for situations demanding large flow inputs. In this paper, pneumatic muscles are controlled by high-speed <b>switch</b> <b>valves,</b> which have high flow rate and fast response, thereby simplifying the design of the frog-inspired robot. In addition, high-speed <b>switch</b> <b>valves</b> are light weight, occupy small volume, and incur low cost, and is thus preferable in the robot system.|$|R

In {{order to develop}} a high-performance automated proteome analysis system allowing direct injection sample containing detergents, the influence of void volume varied from 0 to 5 mu L on the separation performance and proteomic coverage of sample injection system using strong cation-exchange (SCX) trap column was investigated, it was found the void volume hardly affects the separation performance by using SCX trap column. Thus, a fully automated sample injection system using SCX trap column and ten-port <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> was established for efficient shotgun proteome analysis. In this system, a nanoflow <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> and a microtee were used to connect the SCX trap and analytical columns, and the uncleaned samples of proteolytic digests containing contaminants could be directly injected with minor influence on the separation performance, which was demonstrated to be a useful strategy in proteome analysis.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{fundamental}} principles of energy-conservative hydraulic control {{based on the}} fluid inertance principle are discussed and {{a detailed analysis of}} step-up switched-inertance control is presented. A non-loss system comprising an inertance tube and <b>switching</b> <b>valve</b> is modelled and its operational curves are presented as a reference for an ideal behaviour. Considering the load loss at both the tube and the PWM <b>switched</b> <b>valve,</b> a linear mathematical model for the step-up switched-inertance hydraulic system is presented which describes the pressure response {{as a function of the}} PWM duty cycle. Mathematical expressions of the flow rates through the tube and the supply and return ports as well as the system efficiency are also presented. A system prototype is evaluated on a test rig and the experimental data compared with the theoretical results, demonstrating the model accuracy. The proposed model simplifies the analysis process for step-up switching converters and thus their restrictions and potential can be investigated more quickly...|$|R

30|$|The three {{revolute}} joints of each {{hind leg}} use six pneumatic muscles in total, and each pneumatic muscle {{is controlled by}} two high-speed <b>switch</b> <b>valves.</b> Thus, the entire hind limb requires 12 pneumatic high-speed <b>switch</b> <b>valves.</b> We consider the hip joint as an example to explain the working principle of the pneumatic circuit. The body and the thigh crank are connected with a joint shaft. Each end of the crank is hinged to the muscles, and the other ends {{are connected to the}} body frame. During muscle contraction and stretching, the crank (fixed with the thigh frame) rotates relative to the body. To reach the initial position, the charging valve 1 and discharging valve 2 are open, and the discharging valve 1 and charging valve 2 are closed. The recovery muscle then starts to contract, and the driving muscle stretches until the joint rotates clockwise to the preset position (Figure  6). During the propulsive phase, the hip joint must rotate counterclockwise quickly, and thus the charging valve 1 and discharging valve 2 are close, and charging valve 1 and the discharging valve 2 are open. The recovery muscle of the hip joint then starts to stretch and the driving muscle contracts. The hip joint rotates counterclockwise quickly to a specific position.|$|R
