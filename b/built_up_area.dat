5|$|At the 2011 census {{it had a}} {{population}} of 29,626. It includes Great Malvern on the steep eastern flank of the Malvern Hills, {{as well as the}} former independent urban district of Malvern Link. Many of the major suburbs and settlements that comprise the town are separated by large tracts of open common land and fields, and together with smaller civil parishes adjoining the town's boundaries and the hills, the <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>area</b> is often referred to collectively as The Malverns.|$|E
5|$|The new tracks {{built by}} the London, Midland and Scottish Railway allowed {{additional}} intermediate stations to be constructed on the local lines between 1932 and 1935. Increased local demand {{was caused by the}} expansion of the <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>area</b> of suburban London during the interwar period. The station at Upminster Bridge opened with platforms on the local electric lines on 17 December 1934. The station was operated by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway but was only served by District line trains. After nationalisation of the railways in 1948 management of the station passed to British Railways and in 1969 ownership transferred to the London Underground.|$|E
5|$|Junction 28 of the M5 {{lies within}} the parish of Cullompton {{and a short}} {{distance}} from the town centre. Other major road links are the A373 to Honiton and the former A38 to Exeter which runs through the town, and is now the B3181. In 2001 61.6% of people living in Cullompton travelled to work by car or van and 83% of households had at least one car. In October 1969 a bypass was completed but after only five years this was upgraded to form part of the M5. Since this time traffic coming from the south of Cullompton to the M5 junction has had to pass through the centre of the town. There are now problems with air quality in the town and Mid Devon District Council have made the whole of the <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>area</b> in Cullompton an Air quality management area. Traffic on the exit slip road leaving the M5 northbound often backed up onto the motorway, so the Highways Agency and Devon County Council made junction improvements by widening roads, introducing traffic lights and reopening the left hand lane of the northbound slip road, at a cost of £1.3m. This cost was covered by businesses moving to Cullompton.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{confusion}} in the primary sources over what was the target in Dresden, {{whether it was the}} marshalling yards near the centre or centre of the <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>area.</b> The report by the 1st Bombardment Division's commander to his commander states that the targeting sequence was the centre of the <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>area</b> in Dresden if the weather was clear. If clouds obscured Dresden but Chemnitz was clear, Chemnitz was the target. If both were obscured, they would bomb the centre of Dresden using H2X radar. The mix of bombs for the Dresden raid was about 40% incendiaries—much closer to the RAF city busting mix than that the USAAF usually used in precision bombardment. Taylor compares this 40% mix with the raid on Berlin on 3 February, where the ratio was 10% incendiaries. This was a common mix when the USAAF anticipated cloudy conditions over the target.|$|E

25|$|Leeds {{city centre}} is {{contained}} within the Leeds Inner Ring Road, formed from parts of the A58 road, A61 road, A64 road, A643 road and the M621 motorway. Briggate, the principal north-south shopping street, is pedestrianised and Queen Victoria Street, {{a part of the}} Victoria Quarter, is enclosed under a glass roof. Millennium Square is a significant urban focal point. The Leeds postcode area covers most of the City of Leeds and is almost entirely made up of the Leeds post town. Otley, Wetherby, Tadcaster, Pudsey and Ilkley are separate post towns within the postcode area. Aside from the <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>area</b> of Leeds itself, {{there are a number of}} suburbs and exurbs within the district.|$|E
25|$|Styled after how {{airports}} handle passenger services, besides having escalators and lifts, {{the proposed}} facility will have shopping malls, food plazas, entertainment and recreation centres. The plan also includes vertical {{expansion of the}} station by constructing platforms on different floors. This would enable the railways to make maximum benefit of the <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>area.</b> Segregation of arriving and departing commuters to minimise conflicting movement, and integration of the proposed integrated bus terminus (IBT) and metro services to facilitate travel of passengers, will be key ingredients in the upgrade. The current security apparatus at the station — CCTVs, doorframe metal detectors, hand-held sensors and other detection equipment-might be overhauled {{to fit into the}} new scheme of things. Centralised lighting, seating areas, waiting rooms, retiring rooms and internet kiosks would be upgraded.|$|E
25|$|When {{the railway}} {{merged with the}} Caledonian Railway on 9 July 1847, Greenock Cathcart was the main access to the coast. However, in 1869 their {{dominance}} of this traffic ended when the Glasgow and South Western Railway opened its station on the waterfront at Princes Pier, Greenock. Greenock's growth had led to increasing overcrowding of tenement houses, and passengers were glad to avoid the walk through these streets. Attempts by the Caledonian to extend their railway to Gourock had met with difficulties in getting through a <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>area,</b> but now, spurred by competition, they gained Parliamentary approval in 1884. The route took the railway in a tunnel from the station under the town's Well Park (which provides a level area atop a high rocky crag), then in further cuttings and tunnels westwards through the hillside clear of the expensive properties on the coast. After three years in construction the Gourock Extension Railway opened on 1 June 1889.|$|E
