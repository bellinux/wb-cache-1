5|$|<b>Bonfire</b> was {{postponed}} until 2002 to restructure {{it to make}} it safer. Delays {{in the development of}} a safety plan and a high estimated cost (mainly due to liability insurance), led A president Ray Bowen to postpone <b>Bonfire</b> indefinitely. Despite the university's refusal to allow <b>Bonfire</b> to take place on campus, since 2002 a non-university sanctioned <b>Bonfire</b> has burned annually. Known as Student <b>Bonfire,</b> the off-campus event draws between 8,000 and 15,000 fans.|$|E
5|$|Detractors further {{blamed the}} school for the accident, saying that, {{in the name of}} tradition, administrators {{turned a blind eye to}} an unsafe {{structure}} being constructed with minimal engineering and safety protocols. Before the collapse, some people expressed concerns about the safety of the <b>Bonfire,</b> citing the partial collapse that occurred in a previous <b>Bonfire,</b> the progressively shorter <b>Bonfire</b> burn times (collapse of the stack after lighting) which had dropped from several hours to less than 20minutes, and numerous incidents involving alcohol or unsafe horseplay at the <b>Bonfire</b> site. One of the students killed in the 1999 <b>Bonfire</b> collapse was under the legal drinking age yet a toxicology test showed high blood-alcohol levels; however, lower readings in a second test and inconsistencies in the initial sampling and annotation methods led to questions about the accuracy of the original tests.|$|E

5000|$|Beauty is {{the most}} emblematic element in the <b>Bonfires</b> after the monument. The Beauty {{is a woman who}} is the queen of the festival [...] There are both Beauties and Infantile Beauties {{representing}} <b>Bonfires</b> and Infantile <b>Bonfires</b> respectively.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Bonfires</b> are not {{the same}} as the Valencian Fallas. When <b>Bonfires</b> {{originated}} in Alicante there were not made by [...] "fallero" [...] artists, and the first <b>Bonfires</b> were made by local painters and sculptors. They did not imitate the Valencian style; they were very vanguardist and they followed Art-Dèco and other artistic currents. This vanguard continued throughout the history of the event (except 70's, when Valencian style was adopted), and today <b>Bonfires</b> are different still.|$|R
50|$|In Lithuania <b>bonfires</b> lit to {{celebrate}} St John's Eve (aka: Rasos (Dew Holiday). <b>Bonfires</b> may be lit to keep witches and evil spirit away.|$|R
5|$|In 1978, <b>Bonfire</b> {{shifted to}} a wedding-cake style, in which upper stacks of logs were wedged {{on top of}} lower stacks. The {{structure}} was built around a fortified centerpole, made from two telephone poles. Although tradition stated that if <b>Bonfire</b> burned through midnight A would win the following day's game, {{with the introduction of}} the wedding cake design <b>Bonfire</b> began to fall quickly, sometimes burning for only 30 or 45 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1952, the bonfires were {{constructed}} entirely from fresh-cut logs. The event suffered its first fatality in 1955, {{when a student}} {{was struck by a}} swerving car. The same year (for unrelated reasons), <b>Bonfire</b> was moved from Simpson Drill Field in front of the Memorial Student Center to Duncan Field, near the dorms of the Corps of Cadets (whose leaders oversaw construction). In 1957, the structure collapsed two days before <b>Bonfire</b> was to be held, but students worked around-the-clock to rebuild it, and the <b>bonfire</b> burned as scheduled.|$|E
50|$|In {{the western}} parts of Sweden and in Finnish Ostrobothnia, <b>bonfires</b> {{have at least}} since the 18th century been lit during Holy Saturday. This {{tradition}} is claimed to have its origin in Holland. During the last decades though, the <b>bonfires</b> have in many places been moved to Walpurgis Night, as this is the traditional date for <b>bonfires</b> in many other parts of the country.|$|R
5000|$|In Northern Ireland, <b>bonfires</b> are lit on Halloween, October 31. {{and each}} 11 July, <b>bonfires</b> are lit by many Protestant {{communities}} {{to celebrate the}} victory of Williamite forces at the Battle of the Boyne, which took place on 12 July 1690. This is often called the [...] "Eleventh night". <b>Bonfires</b> have also been lit by Catholic communities on 9 August since 1972 to protest and commemorate Internment.|$|R
50|$|In {{many regions}} of {{continental}} Europe, <b>bonfires</b> are made traditionally on 16 January, the solemnity of John the Baptist, {{as well as}} on Saturday night before Easter. <b>Bonfires</b> are also a feature of Walpurgis Night in central and northern Europe, and the celebrations on the eve of St. John's Day in Spain. In Finland <b>bonfires</b> are tradition on Midsummer Eve and Easter, also in midst of May celebrations.|$|R
5|$|<b>Bonfire</b> (March 21, 1983 – October 28, 2013), {{full name}} Gestion <b>Bonfire,</b> was an Oldenburg gelding that competed in {{dressage}} with Dutch rider Anky van Grunsven. Between 1991 and 2000, the pair competed in multiple {{national and international}} championships, including three Olympic Games and two World Equestrian Games. They won one gold medal and four silver medals at the Olympics and one gold and three silvers at the World Equestrian Games. Although known for having a hot temperament, <b>Bonfire</b> mellowed as he aged, becoming one of Van Grunsven's best horses – until she found his replacement, Salinero, {{she did not think}} she would ever find a horse to match Bonfire's talent. A statue of <b>Bonfire</b> stands in Van Grunsven's home town of Erp.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bonfires</b> {{are used}} on farms, in large gardens and allotments {{to dispose of}} waste plant {{material}} that is not readily composted. This includes woody material, pernicious weeds, diseased material and material treated with persistent pesticides and herbicides. Such <b>bonfires</b> may be quite small but are often designed to burn slowly for several days so that wet and green material may be reduced to ash by frequently turning the unburnt material into the centre. Such <b>bonfires</b> can also deal with turf and other earthy material. The ash from garden <b>bonfires</b> is a useful source of potash and may be beneficial in improving the soil structure of some soils although such fires must be managed with safety in mind. Garden and farm <b>bonfires</b> are frequently smoky and can cause local nuisance if poorly managed or lit in unsuitable weather conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Eleventh Night <b>bonfires</b> have {{involved}} sectarian and loyalist paramilitary displays. Symbols of Irish nationalism/republicanism (such as the Irish tricolour), and symbols of Catholicism, are often burnt on the <b>bonfires.</b> The tricolours on such <b>bonfires</b> are often daubbed with sectarian slogans such as [...] "Kill All Taigs" [...] (KAT) or [...] "Kill All Irish" [...] (KAI). Effigies, and posters of Irish nationalist election candidates, are also sometimes burnt, {{which has been}} condemned as [...] "inciting hatred". More recently, symbols of immigrant communities, especially the large Polish immigrant community, have been burnt on some <b>bonfires.</b> The Polish Association of Northern Ireland, and others, described this as [...] "racist intimidation".|$|R
50|$|The OCS {{celebrate}} the old Cornish tradition of midsummer <b>bonfires,</b> normally held on 23 June each year. The hilltop <b>bonfires</b> that form a chain are {{currently held at}} Kit Hill, St Breock Beacon, Castle An Dinas, and Redruth.|$|R
5|$|Freshmen were {{expected}} to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth. For almost two decades, the students constructed <b>Bonfire</b> from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912. In 1935, a farmer reported that students carried off his entire barn as fuel for <b>Bonfire.</b> To prevent future incidents, the university made <b>Bonfire</b> a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them toward a grove of dead trees {{on the edge of}} town.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, the Campus Ministry Association, {{representing}} 17religious denominations, unanimously {{approved a}} resolution asking {{the university to}} change <b>Bonfire</b> {{because of concerns about}} safety, participant academic performance, humanitarian considerations, and the environment. Shortly afterwards, the Faculty Senate's Committee of the Whole approved a resolution asking for a panel to explore alternatives to <b>Bonfire.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Bonfires</b> of Saint John, Noite de San Xoán or Noite da Queima {{is widely}} spread in all Galician territory, celebrated as a {{welcome to the}} summer {{solstice}} since the Celtic period, and Christianized in Saint John's day eve. <b>Bonfires</b> are believed to make meigas, witches, to flee. They are particularly relevant {{in the city of}} Corunna, where it became Fiesta of National Tourist Interest of Spain. The whole city participate on making great <b>bonfires</b> in each district, whereas the centre of the party is located in the beaches of Riazor and Orzan, in the very city heart, where hundreds of <b>bonfires</b> of different sizes are lighted. Also, grilled sardines are very typical.|$|R
2500|$|The most {{well-known}} custom of [...] is the lighting of <b>bonfires</b> throughout Israel and worldwide wherever religious Jews can be found. In Meron, the burial place of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his son, Rabbi Eleazar, {{hundreds of thousands}} of Jews gather throughout the night and day to celebrate with <b>bonfires,</b> torches, song and feasting. This was a specific request by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai of his students. Some say that as bar Yochai gave spiritual light to the world with the revelation of the Zohar, <b>bonfires</b> are lit to symbolize the impact of his teachings. [...] As his passing left such a [...] "light" [...] behind, many candles and/or <b>bonfires</b> are lit.|$|R
5000|$|Fire {{features}} {{in many of}} the celebrations, with people gathering together and creating large <b>bonfires</b> from any kind of wood, such as old furniture, and sharing food and drinks while teens and children jump over the fires. In some areas, [...] <b>bonfires</b> are traditionally named tequeos, which means people of the dance. Parties are often organized at beaches, where <b>bonfires</b> are lit and a set of firework displays usually take place. On the Spanish Mediterranean coast, especially in Catalonia and Valencia, special foods such as coca de Sant Joan are also served on this occasion. In Alicante, since 1928, the <b>bonfires</b> of Saint John were developed into elaborate constructions inspired by the Falles, or Fallas, of Valencia.|$|R
5|$|November the 5th {{firework}} {{displays and}} <b>bonfire</b> parties are common throughout Britain, in major public displays and in private gardens.

This layer hardened to a consistency similar to concrete.|$|E
5|$|The Texas Board of Professional Engineers {{announced}} in 2000 that the Aggie <b>Bonfire</b> met the requirements {{to be considered}} a complex construction project that should be regulated by state engineering laws.

5000|$|Before 1928, the <b>bonfires</b> of Saint John {{had been}} celebrated in Alicante {{as it had}} been {{elsewhere}} in Europe: by burning old pieces of furniture on the night of Saint John on 24 June.

Jose María Py, the founder of the festival, felt that Alicante needed an important fiesta, and came up with an idea to combine <b>bonfires</b> with a Valencian tradition known as the [...] "falles". The festival ultimately became the most important cultural event in Alicantinian society.|$|R
