50|$|This {{and issues}} of cost led to {{third-party}} implementations of PostScript becoming common, particularly in low-cost printers (where the licensing fee was the sticking point) or in high-end typesetting equipment (where the quest for speed demanded support for new platforms faster than Adobe could provide). At one point, Microsoft licensed to Apple a PostScript-compatible interpreter it had <b>bought</b> <b>called</b> TrueImage, and Apple licensing to Microsoft its new font format, TrueType. Apple ended up reaching an accord with Adobe and licensed genuine PostScript for its printers, but TrueType became the standard outline font technology for both Windows and the Macintosh.|$|R
40|$|Cephalon Inc., a biotech firm, <b>bought</b> <b>call</b> {{options on}} its own stock to meet its {{conditional}} cash flow needs. We analyze this decision by using the cash flow hedging concepts of Froot et al., (1993. Journal of Finance 5, 1629 - 1658). We identify the managerial analyses necessary to apply this theory and discuss managerial considerations absent from the theory. We find that managers consider deadweight costs of risk management, which theory tends to ignore. Theory provides little guidance in how to measure these and other deadweight costs. Finally, uncertainty about the availability of external financing and accounting considerations are critical considerations by managers...|$|R

5000|$|Hernández {{made his}} in-ring debut in 1951, using the ring name Tony Hernández {{as he worked}} for Vera's wrestling {{promotion}} in Nuevo León.

In 1953 former referee Roberto Rangel showed a magazine he <b>bought</b> <b>called</b> Los Espectros de Ultratumba (Spanish for [...] "The Spectres from Beyond the Grave)") to local promoter Jesús Garza Hernández. The two thought it would make for a great wrestling character and unbeknownst to Hernández the promoter had a green suit and mask created specifically for Hernández. While Hernández did not like to wrestle in a full body suit, he still went ahead with the character, wrestling as [...] "Espectro de Ultratumba" [...] from that point on. Working with the promoter Hernández began to develop the Espectro de Ultratumba character further, adding in a large degree of theatrics to his matches, including using an actual coffin as part of his entrance. Prior to his matches, he would be carried to the ring in the coffin, often by several hooded pallbearers or wrestlers dressed like ghosts, allowing Espectro to emerge from the coffin [...] "like a ghost rising from the grave". The spectacle of the entrance combined with the showmanship of Hernández himself made the Espectro de Ultratumba character very popular with the locals.|$|R
