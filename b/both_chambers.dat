5|$|Germany is a federal, parliamentary, {{representative}} democratic republic. The German {{political system}} operates under a framework {{laid out in}} the 1949 constitutional document known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of <b>both</b> <b>chambers</b> of parliament; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, {{and the rule of law}} are valid in perpetuity.|$|E
5|$|NPVIC {{legislation}} {{has been introduced}} in all 50 states. States where only one chamber has adopted the legislation are Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Oregon. In Colorado and New Mexico, the {{legislation has}} passed in <b>both</b> <b>chambers</b> (in different sessions). Bills seeking to repeal the compact in Maryland, New Jersey, and Washington have failed.|$|E
5|$|Senators may {{be members}} of joint {{committees}}: committees jointly established by <b>both</b> <b>chambers</b> of the Australian parliament.

5|$|To {{amend the}} Constitution, {{one of two}} things must happen before the National Assembly can {{consider}} the measure: The president must suggest the change, or 150,000 eligible voters must send a petition to the National Assembly. <b>Both</b> <b>chambers</b> of the National Assembly must discuss the proposed amendments for a minimum of three months. Two conditions can prevent a discussion from taking place: Either there is a state of emergency, or there are less than six months in the current term of the House of Representatives. In order for an amendment to take effect, it must be approved by either two-thirds of <b>both</b> <b>chambers</b> of the National Assembly or a simple majority of the voting population of Belarus in a national referendum. The only restriction is that Sections One, Two, Four and Eight can only be changed by national referendum. Rules for conducting a national referendum are enumerated in Chapters 22 through 25 of the Electoral Code of the Republic of Belarus. Since the original adoption of the Constitution in 1994, it has been amended twice; once in 1996 and once in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Veteran {{organizations}} and politicians reacted negatively. Several {{months after the}} decision, <b>both</b> <b>chambers</b> of Congress passed new versions of the Stolen Valor Act based on the suggestions in the Court's opinion. Despite the Supreme Court having struck down the conviction under the Act, Alvarez remained in prison for fraud on other matters.|$|E
50|$|The AK-74M {{was also}} {{the basis for the}} new Russian AK-100 family of Kalashnikov firearms: the AK-101 assault rifle and AK-102 carbine (<b>both</b> <b>chambered</b> for the NATO-standard 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge), AK-103 assault rifle and AK-104 carbine (<b>both</b> <b>chambered</b> for the 7.62×39mm round) and the 5.45×39mm AK-105 carbine. The AK-101, AK-102, AK-103 and AK-104 are destined {{primarily}} for export, while the AK-105 is slated to replace the AKS-74U with the Russian Armed Forces. Additionally, the 5.45×39mm AK-107 and 5.56×45mm NATO AK-108 rifles have a balanced recoil system to reduce felt recoil and muzzle rise. This balanced recoil system is derived from the AL-7 rifle.|$|R

5|$|A sejm {{began with}} a solemn mass, a {{verification}} of deputies mandates, and election of the Marshal of the Sejm (also known as the Speaker). (The position of the Marshal of the Sejm (and sejmik) {{who presided over the}} proceedings and was elected from the body of deputies evolved in the 17th century.) Next, the kanclerz (chancellor) declared the king's intentions to <b>both</b> <b>chambers,</b> who would then debate separately till the ending ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Failing {{to gather}} enough {{support for a}} floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats {{controlled}} <b>both</b> <b>chambers),</b> the proposal was abandoned in September 1994. Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat, but cited many other factors. The First Lady's approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50s percent range during her first year, fell to 44percent in April 1994 and 35percent by September 1994.|$|E
5|$|In the {{election}} of 2010, Republicans took control of <b>both</b> <b>chambers</b> of the Minnesota legislature {{for the first time}} in 38 years and, with Mark Dayton's election, the DFL party took the governor's office {{for the first time in}} 20 years. Two years later, the DFL regained control of both houses, and with Governor Dayton in office, the party had same-party control of both the legislative and executive branches for the first time since 1990. Two years later, the Republicans regained control of the Minnesota House in the 2014 election, and in 2016, the GOP also regained control of the State Senate.|$|E

5|$|The PJ won the 2001 midterm {{election}} by 40% to 24%, {{giving it a}} majority in <b>both</b> <b>chambers</b> of the Congress. However, the abstention rate and several forms of protest votes combined reached 41%, the highest in Argentine history, {{as a consequence of}} the popular discontent with the two main parties. Even the few candidates of the Alliance who won at their districts, such as the radical Rodolfo Terragno in Buenos Aires, did so with political platforms against De la Rúa's administration.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{works in}} concert with the state legislature (the bicameral Indiana General Assembly, consisting of the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate) and the state supreme court (the Supreme Court of Indiana) to govern the state. The governor has the power to veto legislation passed by the General Assembly. If vetoed, a bill is returned to the General Assembly for reconsideration. Unlike other states, most of which require a two-thirds supermajority to override a veto, the Indiana General Assembly may override the veto with an absolute majority vote in <b>both</b> <b>chambers.</b>|$|E
5|$|The sejms in Warsaw {{were held}} in the Warsaw Castle, within the Chamber of Deputies (Hall of Three Pillars), with the upper Senate Chamber located {{literally}} above it. In the late 17th century, new quarters were constructed for the Chamber of Deputies, and were joined {{on the same level}} by the senate quarters in the mid-18th century. The new Senate Chamber was the larger of the two, as it was intended to host <b>both</b> <b>chambers</b> during the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|<b>Both</b> <b>chambers</b> {{worked to}} {{reconcile}} differences between their respective {{versions of the}} bill, and on April 1, 1994, the last regular day of the legislative session, the Senate passed a compromise bill, but the House killed it on a procedural motion. On April 15, {{the last day of}} the session, which legislators had set aside to override any gubernatorial vetos, the health care bill was reintroduced and passed both houses of the General Assembly. Jones then reversed course and signed it. Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform and the creation of a Health Policy Board to regulate rate increases. It ensured that insurance companies could not deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.|$|E
5|$|During the 2011-2015 term, the State Senate {{was made}} up of 35 Democrats and 12 Republicans. Republicans gained two seats (District 6 in Baltimore County and District 29 in Calvert and St. Mary's counties) in the {{elections}} held on November 4, 2014. Democrats maintain a super-majority in the chamber despite these changes. Article II, Section 17(a) of the Maryland Constitution specifies it takes a three-fifths vote of <b>both</b> <b>chambers</b> to override a veto, which is 29 votes in the State Senate. The rules of the Senate also permit members to limit debate by a three-fifths majority vote, meaning Republicans would need to gain five additional seats, for a total of 19, in order to sustain a veto or filibuster legislation.|$|E
5|$|Mathias {{began his}} first term in the Senate in January 1969 and laid out his {{legislative}} agenda soon thereafter. He {{was appointed to the}} District of Columbia committee, where he argued in favor of home rule in the district and providing D.C. residents full representation in <b>both</b> <b>chambers</b> of Congress. Both were positions he carried over from his career in the House. In December 1970 he finally gained passage of legislation creating the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. He also served as chair of the Special Committee on Termination of the National Emergency from 1971 to 1977, which produced Senate Report 93-549.|$|E

5|$|In the November general {{election}} Hatfield faced Democratic incumbent Robert D. Holmes. In {{the final days}} of the campaign U.S. Senator Wayne Morse, a Democrat, implied Hatfield lied in his trial regarding the deadly car accident when he was 17. This tactic backfired as the press denounced the comments, as did Holmes and other Democrats. Hatfield defeated Holmes, winning 55.3% of the vote in the election. That same election saw the Democratic Party gain a majority in <b>both</b> <b>chambers</b> of the state legislature for the first time since 1878. Holmes' defeat was attributed in part to the image and charisma portrayed by Hatfield and in part due to the campaign issues such as the declining economy, increased taxation, capital punishment, labor, and education. After the election, Holmes attempted to appoint David O'Hara as Secretary of State to replace Hatfield, who would have to resign to become governor. Hatfield appointed Howell Appling, Jr. to the office, and O'Hara challenged the appointment in state court. The Oregon Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hatfield on the constitutional issue, with the appointment of Appling confirmed. He was the youngest governor in the history of Oregon at that point in time at the age of 36.|$|E
5|$|National referendums, or plebiscites, are {{elections}} whereby {{citizens can}} {{determine whether a}} specific legal text can become official law or not. For this to take place, {{one of the following}} conditions must be met: The president wishes to hold one, both houses of the National Assembly request to hold one, or the citizens petition for it. If the National Assembly calls for a plebiscite, a majority is needed in <b>both</b> <b>chambers</b> for it to be official. If the citizens request a plebiscite, they must gather 430,000 signatures from eligible voters across the country. Additionally, over 30,000 people from each region must sign the petition, including the capital Minsk. Once either condition is met, the president must issue a decree setting the date of the national plebiscite. The plebiscite must take place less than three months after the decree was signed. Local cities can hold their own plebiscites if ten percent of the local population ask for it.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1960, Kasa-Vubu {{announced}} that he had unilaterally dismissed Lumumba on national radio using the massacres in South Kasai as a pretext and with the promise of American backing. Andrew Cordier, the American UN representative in the Congo, used his position to block communications by Lumumba's faction and to prevent a coordinated MNC-L reaction to the news. <b>Both</b> <b>chambers</b> of Parliament, however, supported Lumumba and denounced Kasa-Vubu's action. Lumumba attempted to dismiss Kasa-Vubu from his position, but could not get support for this, precipitating a constitutional crisis. Ostensibly in order to resolve the deadlock, Joseph-Désiré Mobutu launched a bloodless coup and replaced both Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba with a College of Commissionaires-General (Collège des Commissaires-généraux) consisting of a panel of university graduates, led by Justin Bomboko. Soviet military advisors were ordered to leave. Allegedly, the coup was intended to force the politicians to take cooling-off period before they could resume control. In practice, however, Mobutu sided with Kasa-Vubu against Lumumba, who was placed under house arrest, guarded by Ghanaian UN troops and an outer ring of ANC soldiers. Kasa-Vubu was re-appointed President by Mobutu in February 1961. From the coup onwards, Mobutu was able to exert considerable power in Congolese politics behind the scenes.|$|E

25|$|If {{no single}} {{candidate}} gets {{a majority of}} <b>both</b> the <b>Chamber</b> and the Senate, a second round is then called for. At this stage, a candidate requires an absolute majority of merely those actually present {{at the time of}} voting in <b>both</b> the <b>Chamber</b> of Deputies and the Senate. The actual number of votes required in the second round might be the same as in the first round, but as in 2008, it can be a little less, due to the absence of a few parliamentarians. Nevertheless, in this second round, a single candidate would need to win a majority in <b>both</b> the <b>Chamber</b> and the Senate.|$|R
