40|$|The major {{features}} and {{physics of the}} aerodynamic interactions between various main components of a generic four-wheel landing gear are studied. The study was conducted {{as a part of}} the UK ATI ALGAAP (Advanced Landing Gear Aero-loads and Aero-noise Prediction) project. Delayed Detached-Eddy Simulations with the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model with fixed laminar-turbulent transition are performed to compare three configurations of landing-gear components. The wheel geometry is the same as in the tandem-wheel configuration that was previously studied for the ALGAAP project. For this geometry both simulations and experiments are available for validation and comparison with the current results on the four-wheel bogie. The effect of the fixed transition are also assessed on the four-wheel geometry and compared with the tandem wheels. The results show strong effects of the axles and the <b>bogie</b> <b>beam</b> on the low past the wheels. The axles generate a wide low-pressure wake in the aft part of the front wheels, which increases the mean drag coefficient of the front wheels. The flow features observed on the three configurations show some similarities with the flow features that were reported on tandem wheels, with a few differences. Adding axles and <b>bogie</b> <b>beam</b> increases the mean drag significantly on the front wheels, and slightly on the downstream wheels. Adding a main strut reduces the mean drag of the downstream wheels, but the mean drag of the front wheels slightly increases. A similar trend is seen with the RMS. The effect of the fixed transition in the four-wheel case is important in order to capture the transitional ow features but does not show an effect on the mean force coefficients as strong as on the tandem wheels...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{recently}} more used {{method of}} improving weld quality at the weld {{transition to the}} plate called HFMI (High Frequency Mechanical Impact) has been investigated and tried on two demonstrators, a <b>bogie</b> <b>beam</b> in an articulated hauler and a dipper arm in an excavator, see fig. 1. The designs of the beams have been made so that thinner plates can be used and higher material strength can be utilized. Such an approach needs {{to make use of}} local based analysis methods and in this case the effective notch method was used. Recently made research has suggested SN-curves where the use of HFMI in combination with different material yield strengths are described and these FAT values have been used to develop allowed stress levels in the beams to fulfill the life requirements. All this resulted in components which were 24 % and 18 % lighter using plate thicknesses of 8 - 12 mm in material yield 700 MPa. They were then produced and tested in a rig to verify the designs. The results imply that the HFMI treatment is a very promising method to build lighter welded structures, however, the design needs to take some new considerations into account to succeed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} work {{is to improve the}} {{accuracy}} and efficiency of aerodynamic load predictions on landing gear in flight conditions, as part of the UK TSB ALGAAP(Advanced Landing Gear Aero-loads and Aero-noise Prediction) project. To this purpose,both experiments and simulations are performed on simplified landing-gear components. The new geometry presented in this work is a configuration composed of two simplified wheels in tandem. Experimental and numerical results from a single-wheel geometry are used as a baseline for comparison. The models are tested in the University of Southampton wind-tunnel complex, where forces, surface pressures and velocity fields are measured {{to gain a better understanding}} of both mean and unsteady flow features. Also, a vibration test is employed for the first time in a wind tunnel to validate the unsteady load measurements. The results of the experiments are presented in this thesis, showing the wake structure of the flow past the tandem wheels and the configurations that provide minimum values of mean drag and unsteady fluctuations. On the same single-wheel and tandem-wheel geometries, advanced numerical simulations such as Delayed Detached-Eddy Simulations (DDES) with the Spalart-Allmaras equation are used to predict the flow. The methodology is based on the use of techniques to improve the efficiency of the process, thus unstructured grids with a semi-structured boundarylayer mesh are employed to achieve the desired results. The results of the simulations are compared with the experiments, showing the importance of modifying the standard turbulence model in order to consider the laminar-turbulent transition for improved accuracy. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is also employed to analyse the data of both experiments and simulation, in order to obtain a better insight of the flow features. Finally, additional simulations are performed on a simplified four-wheel landing gear to understand the effects of additional components, such as axles and <b>bogie</b> <b>beam.</b> The results show the high importance of the axles on the flow past the wheels and the effect of the modifications of the turbulence model on the full landing gear...|$|E

This was an off-highway, heavy haulage tractor, first produced in 1927. It showed outstanding cross-country performance {{due to the}} design that included the patent <b>beam</b> <b>bogie</b> rear axle, with 2 ft of vertical movement {{for each of the}} rear wheels. This design was the work of Oliver Danson North. The Pioneer proved popular in the oil field and forestry (logging) markets, and formed the basis of the British Army's Second World War R100 30-ton tank transporter.

40|$|Vibrations of {{a vehicle}} that moves on a long elastic {{structure}} can become unstable because of elastic waves that the vehicle generates in the structure. A typical example of the vehicle that can experience such instability is a high-speed train. Moving with a sufficiently high speed, this train could generate in the railway track elastic waves, whose reaction might destabilise vibrations of the train. Such instability could increase the level of vibrations of both the train and the railway track, significantly worsening the comfort of passengers and increasing the probability of the track deterioration and the train derailment. Instability of a moving vehicle on an elastic structure can be classified {{as one of the}} "moving load problems". This class of problems has been drawing attention of researches {{for more than a century}} being a fundamental issue in dynamics of bridges and railway tracks. Recently, the classical "moving load problem" has attracted researches once again because of the rapid development of high-speed railways. The necessity to take a fresh look at this old problem is based on the fact that in earlier studies it was usually assumed that the load speed is much smaller than the wave velocity in the elastic structure, which the load moves on. Nowadays, this assumption is no longer acceptable, since modern high-speed trains are able to move with a speed that is comparable with the wave velocity in a railway track. The main objective of this thesis is to study the stability of the train-track system at high speeds. The practical aim behind this objective is to develop an accurate and efficient method that would allow for choosing parameters of the train-track system so that the stability is guaranteed at operational train speeds. Having such a method developed, this thesis aims to study the effect of physical parameters of a moving train bogie on stability of the train-track system; analyse the effect of periodical inhomogeneity of the track that is caused by sleepers and rail corrugation on stability of the train-track system; investigate the effect of waves in the track subsoil on stability of the train-track system; To investigate the influence of the physical parameters {{of a vehicle}}, a simplified model for a railway track, namely a one-dimensional homogeneous elastically supported Timoshenko beam is used. Since instability depends on the reaction of elastic system, a so-called equivalent stiffness of the Timoshenko beam (a complex-valued function that depends on the frequency of vibrations of the contact point, its velocity and parameters of the beam and foundation) in a moving contact point is introduced and studied. For this development, the most important is the dependence of the equivalent stiffness on the velocity of the contact point. Therefore, this dependence is investigated thoroughly and then compared to that of an Euler-Bernoulli beam. Then, a two-mass oscillator, moving uniformly along such an elastic system is considered. It has been shown that vertical vibrations of this oscillator as it moves along the beam may become unstable if the oscillator's velocity exceeds the minimum phase velocity of waves in the beam. In this case, the equivalent dynamic stiffness of the beam has a negative imaginary part, which may be referred to as a "negative radiation damping" that is caused by radiation of anomalous Doppler waves. Instability domains in the parameter space of the system are found with the help of the D-decomposition method. The effect of various parameters of the system on its stability is studied. Then, a more realistic model for the vehicle is considered, namely a bogie that has two contact points with the <b>beam.</b> The <b>bogie</b> is modelled by a rigid bar of a finite length on two identical supports. The parametric analysis of the instability domain is performed with the emphasis on the effect of the <b>bogie</b> and the <b>beam</b> parameters and comparative analysis with simpler models (two-mass oscillator and simplified bogie) is carried out. Then, influence of the periodic inhomogeneity of elastic structure (actually, a railway track is periodically inhomogeneous due to the sleepers and also can become inhomogeneous due to corrugation of the rails) on the instability is studied. To this end, a simplistic model for the vehicle is utilised, namely a moving mass. The structure is modelled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam on visco-elastic foundation. The inhomogeneity is introduced by assuming that either the foundation stiffness or the beam cross-section is a periodic function of the co-ordinate. By moving on such a structure, the vehicle could experience parametric instability. It is found out that for high-speed trains, the zones of parametric instability are very narrow and, therefore should not be of concern. What could be a practically important threat is the instability that occurs when the minimum phase velocity of waves in the railway track is exceeded by the train. How large is this velocity? To answer this question, it is not enough to consider one-dimensional models of the railway track. The phase velocity of waves in a railway track is strongly influenced by the track subsoil. Therefore, to make a plausible estimation of train velocities at which the instability may arise, a three-dimensional model that includes the track subsoil should be employed. To this end, a railway track has been modelled by a beam resting on a visco-elastic half-space. The instability domain in the space of physical parameters of the system is found and parametrically studied with the help of the D-decomposition method. The main attention has been paid to the effect of the half-space parameters, especially to that of the material damping. It has been proved, that instability can occur at the velocities that are reachable for modern high-speed trains. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
