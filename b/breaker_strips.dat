2500|$|The first {{prototype}} flew for {{the first}} time on 15 May 1959 but was lost in a fatal crash during single engine tests on 2 August 1959. [...] Development work continued on a second aircraft which first flew in 1960 and a third followed in 1962. The fourth aircraft, now renamed the Simmering-Graz-Pauker SGP.222 was intended as a production prototype and demonstrator and appeared at the 1964 Hamburg show, though it turned out to be the last of the line. [...] It incorporated several changes in response to the lengthy development trials. The wing leading edges had <b>breaker</b> <b>strips</b> added and there were new fillets in this edge at the root and on the outboard side of the engine cowlings. [...] The ailerons were mass balanced and fitted with ground adjustable trim tabs, and the upper hinge gaps sealed with fabric. The most obvious external changes were to the empennage where the horizontal tail now had positive dihedral and the previously rounded vertical tail had been enlarged and given severe straight taper, assisted by a ventral fin to improve low speed handling. Both elevators and the rudder had trim tabs.|$|E
50|$|Wsiewołod Jakimiuk, a Polish pre-war engineer, {{served as}} the {{principal}} designer and led the design team {{in the development of}} the new aircraft, which became known as the Chipmunk. He designed a cantilever monoplane that incorporated numerous advances over typical trainer aircraft then in widespread service. These included an enclosed cockpit complete with a rear-sliding canopy, and various aerodynamic features to manage the aircraft's flight performance. Strakes were fitted to deter spin conditions and stall <b>breaker</b> <b>strips</b> along the inboard leading edges of the wing ensured that a stall would originate in this position as opposed to the outboard section. The Chipmunk would become the first indigenous aircraft design to be produced by de Havilland Canada.|$|E
5000|$|Chyeranovskii {{designed}} {{an enlarged}} BICh-3, at approximately 1.5 scale, with tandem open cockpits, underslung elevons (à la Junkers) centreline mono-wheel, wing-tip rudders with skids with no tail. Flight testing commenced in 1929 but was soon halted {{due to the}} very poor handling characteristics which rendered the BICh-7 almost impossible to take-off.The BICh-7 was completely re-built as the BICh-7A, modifications included: enclosed tandem cockpits, a conventional style tail-skid undercarriage, and a fin with rudder faired into {{the rear of the}} cockpit nacelle.Flight tests resumed, in , with much improved handling other than excessive speed loss when turning and engine vibration. The speed loss was attributed to interference between the large elevons and the rudder and was alleviated by adding <b>breaker</b> <b>strips</b> to the elevons and setting them at a lower incidence.|$|E

50|$|Overload {{protection}} {{protects the}} cable from excess current. The protective device will automatically switch {{off when the}} devices plugged into it are drawing more power than the strip is rated to supply. For example, the standard rating for overload protected power strips is 2400W in Australia, so exceeding that amount of power will make the circuit <b>breaker</b> trip. Power <b>strips</b> offering only overload protection generally {{do not have a}} power light, but they do have a reset switch, which is used to return the strip to service after an overload has caused it to trip.|$|R
