40|$|The present {{work has}} been {{performed}} to study the growth and metabolic activities of maize and <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> plants which are shown to have a degree of sensitivity to salinity and to determine the role of amino acids proline or phenylalanine in increasing the salt tolerance of theses plants. Dry mass, water content, leaf area and photosynthetic pigment of maize and <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> plants decreased with increasing salinity. These changes were accompanied with {{a drop in the}} contents of soluble sugars, soluble proteins and amino acids. This was accompanied by a marked increase in the proline content. When maize and <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> plants sprayed with proline or phenylalanine the opposite effect was occurred, saccharides as well as proteins progressively increased at all sanitization levels and proline concentration significantly declined. Salinity significantly increased the sodium content in both shoots and roots of maize and <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> plants, while a decline in the accumulation of K+, Ca++, Mg++ and P was observed. Amino acids treatments markedlyaltered the selectivity of Na+, K+, Ca++ and P in both maize and <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> plants.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Broad</b> <b>bean</b> seeds, {{with a high}} {{nutritional}} value at green maturity stage, are used for direct human consumption and in food processing. However <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> green seeds had as a very shortly time to use because the green seeds very quickly lost the white-green fresh colour. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the content of biologically active substances in fresh <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> seeds immediately after the harvest and seeds from pods stored for a week under low temperature conditions. Experimental material consisted of fresh, green <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> seeds of Bachus, Basta, R- 366 / 1, Bolero, Jankiel Biaáy, and Windsor Biaáy cultivars. <b>Broad</b> <b>bean</b> seeds were sown in the second decade of April at 60 × 10 cm spacing, 100 seeds per plot of 6. 0 m 2 area. <b>Broad</b> <b>bean</b> pods were harvested once at the stage of technological maturity of seeds in the second and third decade of July. Marketable seed samples of 500 g were collected for laboratory tests. At the same time, immediately after the harvest, samples of 2 kg marketable <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> pods of each culti-var were collected and storage within 7 days at 1 – 4 °C. The contents of L-ascorbic acid, chlorophyll (a + b), flavonoids (QE), free phenolic acids sum (CAE), and dry matter were determined in <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> seeds directly after the harvest as well as in the seeds from the pods stored for 7 days. In the results of the investigation indicate that green faba bean seeds from the storage pods had a good white-green colour and marketable quality, how-ever the seeds had the significantly lowest content of L-ascorbic acid and chlorophyll (a + b).

40|$|The {{influence}} of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (Glomus etunicatum) and phosphorous fertilization was studied on growth and metabolic changes in <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> plants (Vicia faba) grown under drought conditions. Addition of phosphate {{to the soil}} caused {{an increase in the}} growth of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants. The applied drought stress reduced growth responses, net assimilation rate, mycorrhizal infection and nodulation of <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> plants. Arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation significantly increased dry matter production, photosynthetic pigments, phosphorous content, relative water content and alkaline phosphatase of <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> compared to non-mycorrhizal plants, but these beneficial effects were significantly reduced with increasing soil phosphorous. In most instances, drought-stressed mycorrhizal plants had significant higher shoot dry weight, leaf area, nodule number, relative water content, acid and alkaline phosphatases and total soluble sugars relative to non-mycorrhizal plants particularly in P-deficient soil. Most of these parameters were unaffected by phosphorous fertilization, and therefore phosphorous had no effect on drought resistance of <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> plants.

40|$|In-flight {{orientation}} of the braconid Aphidius ervi in response to volatiles released from <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> plants infested by the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, was studied in a no-choice wind-tunnel bioassay. The role of aphid infestation level and duration, systemic production of volatiles by "insect-free" parts of the plant, and the specificity of aphid-induced volatiles on the flight behavior of the foraging female parasitoids were investigated. The upper insect-free part of a three-leaved <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> plant, which was basally infested by a population of 40 A. pisum, released synomones detectable by A. ervi females after at least 48 - 72 hr of infestation, resulting in both significant increases iii oriented flights and landings on the source compared with uninfested control plants. This suggests that volatiles involved in host-location by A. ervi are systemically released by <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> plants either in response to circulation of aphid saliva, circulation of saliva-induced bioactive elicitors, or circulation of the synomones themselves. Air entrainment extracts of volatiles collected from a <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> plant infested by the nonhost Aphis fabae or an uninfested <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> plant elicited few oriented flights and landing responses by female parasitoids.

40|$|Abstract Background Non-host {{resistance}} (NHR) confers {{plant species}} immunity against {{the majority of}} microbial pathogens and represents the most robust and durable form of plant resistance in nature. As {{one of the main}} genera of rust fungi with economic and biological importance, Puccinia infects almost all cereals but is unable to cause diseases on legumes. Little is known about the mechanism of this kind of effective defense in legumes to these non-host pathogens. Results In this study, the basis of NHR in <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> (Vicia faba L.) against the wheat stripe rust pathogen, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), was characterized. No visible symptoms were observed on <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> leaves inoculated with Pst. Microscopic observations showed that successful location of stomata and haustoria formation were significantly reduced in Pst infection of <b>broad</b> <b>bean.</b> Attempted infection induced the formation of papillae, cell wall thickening, production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition and accumulation of phenolic compounds in plant cell walls. The few Pst haustoria that did form in <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> cells were encased in reactive oxygen and callose materials and those cells elicited cell death. Furthermore, a total of seven defense-related genes were identified and found to be up-regulated during the Pst infection. Conclusions The results indicate that NHR in <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> against Pst results from a continuum of layered defenses, including basic incompatibility, structural and chemical strengthening of cell wall, posthaustorial hypersensitive response and induction of several defense-related genes, demonstrating the multi-layered feature of NHR. This work also provides useful information for further determination of resistance mechanisms in <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> to rust fungi, especially the adapted important <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> rust pathogen, Uromyces viciae-fabae, because of strong similarity and association between NHR of plants to unadapted pathogens and basal resistance of plants to adapted pathogens. </p...|$|R
