500|$|... "Metzengerstein: A Tale in Imitation of the German", was {{the first}} short story by American writer and poet Edgar Allan Poe to see print. It was first {{published}} in the pages of Philadelphia's Saturday Courier magazine, in 1832. The story follows the young Frederick, the last of the Metzengerstein family, who carries on a long-standing feud with the Berlifitzing family. Suspected of causing a fire that kills the Berlifitzing family patriarch, Frederick becomes intrigued with a previously unnoticed and untamed horse. Metzengerstein is punished for his cruelty when his own home catches fire and the horse carries him into the flame. Part of a Latin hexameter by Martin Luther serves as the story's epigraph: Pestis eram vivus—moriens tua mors ero ("Living I have <b>been</b> <b>your</b> plague, dying I shall be your death").|$|E

As a wedding present, Sir Moses Montefiore, a banker and philanthropist, presented Beatrice and Henry with a silver tea service inscribed: [...] "Many daughters have acted virtuously, but thou excellest them all." [...] The Times newspaper, shortly before Beatrice's marriage, wrote: [...] "The devotion of your Royal Highness to our beloved Sovereign has won our warmest admiration and our deepest gratitude. May those blessings which it has hitherto <b>been</b> <b>your</b> constant aim to confer on others now be returned in full measure to yourself." [...] The sentence was, {{as far as it}} dared, criticising the Queen's hold over her daughter.|$|E

2500|$|Speaking of the {{thinking}} behind titling the album 'Pulse', Braxton explained to UK R writer Pete Lewis – Deputy Editor of Blues & Soul – in May 2010: [...] "It comes from when I got ill. I went into cardic rehab, {{and there was}} this older lady there. She was like 'What are you doing here so young? It must have <b>been</b> <b>your</b> heart. You know what? This is my fourth heart-attack and you're so young, you can't be AFRAID! You can't stop LIVING!'... Then she told me how she'd just got back from holiday with her 40-year-old boyfriend! And because I'd lost hope – the doctors had told me I'd never be able to record again – her conversation was like that heartbeat, that pulse that gave me back the love of life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{her second}} memoir, This 'N That (1987), Davis wrote, [...] "I am still {{recovering}} {{from the fact that}} a child of mine would write about me behind my back, to say nothing about the kind of book it is. I will never recover as completely from B.D.'s book as I have from the stroke. Both were shattering experiences." [...] Her memoir concluded with a letter to her daughter, in which she addressed her several times as [...] "Hyman", and described her actions as [...] "a glaring lack of loyalty and thanks for the very privileged life I feel you have been given". She concluded with a reference to the title of Hyman's book, [...] "If it refers to money, if my memory serves me right, I've <b>been</b> <b>your</b> keeper all these many years.

2500|$|The {{band members}} had a mixed {{experience}} in Hamburg. Harrison later said that [...] "a lot of ghosts materialised {{out of the}} woodwork – people you didn't necessarily want to see again, who had <b>been</b> <b>your</b> best friend one drunken Preludin night back in 1960." [...] McCartney commented: [...] "It was as if we'd mutated into something different and yet we were still just the boys. But we knew and they knew that we'd got famous in the meantime …" [...] The Beatles had also tired of the generally inane questions put to them at press conferences throughout the German tour, with only McCartney attempting to humour the local reporters. At the between-shows press conference in Hamburg, Lennon's impatience was palpable, leading a female reporter to ask why the band had become [...] "so horrid and snobby". On 27 June, the Beatles and their entourage flew from Hamburg to London's Heathrow Airport, where they boarded a Japan Airlines (JAL) flight over the North Pole to Tokyo.|$|E
2500|$|On November 29, 2007, The New York Times {{noted that}} Lott's brother-in-law, Richard Scruggs, was indicted {{on charges of}} {{offering}} a $40,000 bribe to a Mississippi state judge in a fee dispute. Scruggs represented Lott and then Representative Gene Taylor in settlements with State Farm Insurance company [...] after the insurer refused to pay claims {{for the loss of}} their Mississippi homes in Hurricane Katrina. Lott and Taylor had pushed through federal legislation to investigate claims handling of State Farm and other insurers after Hurricane Katrina, a potential conflict of interest. On July 30, 2008, the Associated Press reported that during a deposition related to the Hurricane Katrina claims, Zach Scruggs, son of Richard Scruggs, was asked by State Farm Fire & Casualty Cos. attorney Jim Robie, [...] "Has it <b>been</b> <b>your</b> custom and habit in prosecuting litigation to have Senator Lott contact and encourage witnesses to give false information?" [...] Zach Scruggs responded, [...] "I invoke my Fifth Amendment rights in response to that question." [...] On February 14, 2009, The New York Times noted in relation to an indictment of Judge Bobby DeLaughter for taking bribes from Scruggs that federal prosecutors have said that Lott was induced by Scruggs to offer DeLaughter a federal judgeship in order to gain the judge's favor. [...] The Richard Scruggs controversy was the subject of the 2009 book Kings of Tort in 2009 by Alan Lange, and the 2010 book The Fall of the House of Zeus: The Rise and Ruin of America's Most Powerful Trial Lawyer.|$|E
