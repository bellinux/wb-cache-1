2500|$|In finance, {{arbitrage}} pricing theory (APT) is {{a general}} theory of asset pricing that holds that the expected return of a financial asset can be modeled as a linear function of various macro-economic factors or theoretical market indices, where sensitivity to changes in each factor is represented by a factor-specific <b>beta</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The model-derived rate of return will then be used to price the asset correctly—the asset price should equal the expected end of period price discounted at the rate implied by the model. If the price diverges, arbitrage should bring it back into line.|$|E

3000|$|The {{dynamics}} of <b>beta</b> <b>coefficients</b> from [...] g [...] models {{indicate that there}} was divergence (positive <b>beta</b> <b>coefficients)</b> in 2003 and 2004 and then convergence (negative <b>beta</b> <b>coefficients)</b> {{for the rest of}} the observed period with local peaks in 2009 and 2013. The rapid convergence continues till the beginning of the 2020 s. From two previous results subsections, we know that this period is characterized by the anticipated rapid decrease in the TSR in East-European regions. Then, there is hardly any convergence in the 2020 s and early 2030 s while East-European regions experience an alleviating echo effect of a relatively smaller generation born to the very small generation of parents born in the 1990 s (see, for example, population pyramids for Romania in the Appendix, Figure 11). Finally, fast convergence starts again in the middle of the 2030 s when the smaller “echo generation” enters working ages. In short, most of the regional convergence in aging in Europe seems to be driven by the {{dynamics of}} the TSR in the regions of Eastern Europe.|$|R

The {{empirical}} study is carried on nineteen Belgian stocks quoted on this Market from {{the introduction of the}} Computer Assisted Trading System (C. A. T. S.), beginning of 1989, until the 31 st of December 1992. The existence of an intervalling {{effect on the}} Brussels Forward Market is highlighted, the estimated systematic risks depend on the length of the interval chosen to calculate the returns. As far as the Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model is concerned, the results show that the <b>beta</b> <b>coefficients</b> still depend on the differencing interval and do not perform better than the Ordinary Least Square estimated betas. Thus the intervalling effect doesn't seem to be due to conditional heteroscedasticity. It also appears that the Scholes and Williams' and the Dimson's models produce <b>beta</b> <b>coefficients</b> for a one-day interval which are closer to the asymptotic betas than the Ordinary Least Square estimated betas based on daily observations. We may therefore conclude that models such as Scholes and Williams' and Dimson's can "improve" the estimated <b>beta</b> <b>coefficients.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{asymmetric}} dynamic rotation of <b>beta</b> <b>coefficients</b> to global investment style factor shocks in the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) universe of assets and its implications for investment management. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses an asymmetric extension of the Christodoulakis and Satchell approach of time varying <b>beta</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Findings – Evidence suggests that positive (negative) style factor shocks tend to be associated more with increases (decreases) in <b>beta</b> <b>coefficients</b> rather than the reverse. Research limitations/implications – There is a need to examine other forms of beta rotation and the degree of common persistence and empirical applications to investment management and portfolio performance attribution. Practical implications – Forecast the evolution of beta. Persistent positive or negative shocks could spark rotating investment exposures, particularly relevant during turbulent periods in which asset managers may engage onto tactical asset allocation strategies. Originality/value – The paper explores the asymmetric rotation of style factors in the MSCI universe of assets. The results can be used in applied investment management involving dynamic asset allocation strategies. Accounting, Assets, Beta factor, Data analysis, Investments...|$|R
