5|$|Curator of Birds Gary R. Graves of the Smithsonian Institution spent 18 years {{scouring}} {{the island for}} evidence of the taxon without success. He is doubtful of its survival as it is diurnal and Jamaica is a popular destination for birdwatchers. The exact cause of the likely extinction is unknown, but predation by introduced mammals, especially the black rat but possibly also the Indian mongoose, is thought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor.</b> Graves points {{out that there is}} little evidence that habitat loss has played a role. It is noted that this swallow is not affected by being near human disturbance. Graves also added that the swallows adapted to nesting in man-made structures. In general, this swallow is not affected by being near human disturbance. It is proposed that nest boxes be used to counter habitat loss and predation.|$|E
5|$|Diệm deposed head {{of state}} Bảo Đại in a {{fraudulent}} referendum in 1955 and proclaimed himself president of the newly created Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam).

5|$|In 2014, {{the most}} recent year for which {{statistics}} are available, AirTrain JFK carried 6,487,118 paid passengers, with another 10 million using the service for free on-airport travel. This is a 247% increase over 2004, the first full year of operation, when 2,623,791 riders paid. The 2014 paid ridership is 12% of the 53.2 million passengers that used JFK that year. The ridership of AirTrain JFK has risen each year from 2004 to 2014, which Governor Andrew Cuomo touted in a 2015 announcement in which he also announced the plan for AirTrain LaGuardia, a similar system to be built at LaGuardia Airport. The $5 fare is much cheaper than the $45 one must pay for a taxi between Manhattan and JFK, which may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> in the increased ridership.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, HIV causes AIDS by {{depleting}} CD4+ T cells. This {{weakens the}} immune system and allows opportunistic infections. T cells are essential to the immune response and without them, the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells. The mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases. During the acute phase, HIV-induced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells accounts for CD4+ T cell depletion, although apoptosis may also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>factor.</b> During the chronic phase, the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of {{the immune system}} to generate new T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4+ T cell numbers.|$|E

With some high-profile defections of star league players to cashed-up rugby union clubs from France, Hunt is expected to be the target of offers from overseas and within Australia. Australian rugby union club Queensland Reds stated their intentions to attempt to lure Hunt to the rugby union code, with the reasoning being his successful young career in rugby union. From within the NRL competition, Sydney based clubs Sydney Roosters and St. George Illawarra Dragons stated their intentions to make a bid for Hunt for his services in the 2010 season, claiming they could double Hunt's three-year deal from 2006, reported to be around $200,000.
