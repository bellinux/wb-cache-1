Eddison was a stage and television veteran only appearing once before in film (a supporting role in Peter Ustinov's 1948 comedy Vice Versa). Glover recalled Eddison was excited and nervous for his film debut, often asking if he had performed correctly.

5|$|Diệm's trip {{came after}} two years of American {{attempts}} to schedule a state visit. In 1955, Washington made two attempts to organise a trip while Diệm was still prime minister, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> busy quelling opposition groups and his grip on power was tenuous. Diệm took care of this by crushing the Bình Xuyên organised crime syndicate in the Battle for Saigon in May 1955, and then deposed Bảo Đại and proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam after his brother Ngô Đình Nhu rigged a referendum that made him head of state. Diệm was credited with 98.2% of the votes and 133% in the capital Saigon. The South Vietnamese leader's visit was organized after he indicated interest in February 1957 to US Ambassador to South Vietnam Frederick Reinhardt.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{came in and}} {{accompanied}} Morris for 39 further runs before falling to Edrich. Lindwall fell for nine before Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving. It took a run out to remove Morris; he attempted a quick run after the ball was hit to third man. Morris was called through for a run by Don Tallon, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> slow for the substitute fielder Reg Simpson's arm. Australia went on to finish with 389. Morris had scored {{more than half the}} runs {{as the rest of the}} team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. Hollies tossed the ball up repeatedly, coaxing the Australians into attacking balls that spun after pitching on off stump. Morris took four catches for the match as Australia took victory by an innings and 149 runs, sealing a 40 Test series triumph.|$|E
5|$|However, Elton ends {{up being}} cornered in a dead end alley. As he resigns himself to being absorbed, the TARDIS materializes and the Doctor and Rose emerge from within. The Abzorbaloff {{attempts}} to ransom Elton {{in exchange for the}} Doctor, but the Doctor feigns disinterest in Elton's fate, while dropping a hint to the absorbed members of LINDA. In response, the absorbed members collectively use their willpower to suppress the Abzorbaloff, who ends up dropping his cane. At Ursula's prompting, Elton breaks the cane, which causes the Abzorbaloff to melt into the ground. The Doctor explains that the cane created a limitation field to suppress the alien's power, but with it broken, he lost control and his power caused him to be absorbed by the ground. The Doctor then recalls his first encounter with Elton, and explains that he was at Elton's house years ago tracking an elemental shade, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late and the shade killed Elton's mother.|$|E

5|$|Nothing can {{be gleaned}} from the {{contemporary}} skaldic poems on {{the causes of the}} battle. Adam of Bremen states that Olaf Tryggvason's Danish wife, Thyri, egged him on to make war against Denmark. When Olaf heard that Svein Forkbeard and Olaf the Swede had formed an alliance, he was angered and decided the time had come for an attack. Ágrip and Historia Norwegie have a similar account. Thyri was the sister of Svein Forkbeard, and when Olaf Tryggvason married her, Svein refused to pay her promised dowry. Angered, Olaf launched an expedition to attack Denmark, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> impatient to wait for a fleet to assemble from all of Norway, and he set sail for the south with only 11 ships, expecting the rest to follow. When that hope was not realized, he set out for Wendland (Pomerania) to seek allies and on the way was ambushed by Svein and his allies. These accounts are contradicted by a contemporary verse of Halldórr the Unchristian which states that Olaf Tryggvason was travelling from the south {{when he came to the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|In 1075, during William's absence, Ralph de Gael, the Earl of Norfolk, and Roger de Breteuil the Earl of Hereford, {{conspired to}} {{overthrow}} {{him in the}} Revolt of the Earls. The exact reason for the rebellion is unclear, but it was launched at the wedding of Ralph to a relative of Roger's, held at Exning. Another earl, Waltheof, despite being one of William's favourites, was also involved, and some Breton lords were ready to offer support. Ralph also requested Danish aid. William remained in Normandy while his men in England subdued the revolt. Roger was unable to leave his stronghold in Herefordshire because of efforts by Wulfstan, the Bishop of Worcester, and Æthelwig, the Abbot of Evesham. Ralph was bottled up in Norwich Castle by the combined efforts of Odo of Bayeux, Geoffrey of Coutances, Richard fitzGilbert, and William de Warenne. Norwich was besieged and surrendered, and Ralph went into exile. Meanwhile, the Danish king's brother, Cnut, had finally arrived in England with a fleet of 200 ships, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late as Norwich had already surrendered. The Danes then raided along the coast before returning home. William {{did not return to}} England until later in 1075, to deal with the Danish threat and the aftermath of the rebellion, celebrating Christmas at Winchester. Roger and Waltheof were kept in prison, where Waltheof was executed in May 1076. By that time William had returned to the continent, where Ralph was continuing the rebellion from Brittany.|$|E

5|$|In {{a similar}} legend from the Klickitats, {{there was a}} large inland sea between the Cascades and the Rocky Mountains. The Native Americans lived on the sea and each year they would hold two large powwows at Mount Multnomah, one in the spring and one in the fall. The demigod Koyoda Spielei lived among them and settled {{disputes}} among the living things of the earth, including the mountains Pa-toe (Adams) and Yi-east (Hood), sons of the Great Spirit Soclai Tyee. For many years, peace prevailed over the land. Then a beautiful squaw mountain moved to the valley between Pa-toe and Yi-east. She fell in love with Yi-east, but liked to flirt with Pa-toe. This caused the two mountains to quarrel with each other and it quickly escalated into an all out brawl. Ignoring Koyoda’s calls for peace, they belched forth smoke and ash and threw hot rocks at each other. Some time later, they paused for a rest and discovered the catastrophe they had caused. The forests and meadows had been burnt to the ground and many animals and other living things had been killed. The earth had been shaken so severely that a hole had been created in the mountains and the sea had drained away and the Bridge of the Gods was formed. The squaw mountain had hid herself in a cave during the battle and because they could no longer find her, they were about to resume fighting. However, while they had been fighting, Koyoda went to Soclai and told him what was happening. Soclai arrived in time to stop them from resuming their quarrel. He decreed that the squaw mountain should remain in the cave forever and the Bridge of the Gods was to be a covenant of peace between the mountains that he would cause to fall if they ever resumed their quarrel. He also placed an ugly old woman, known as Loo-wit, as a mountain to guard the bridge and remind the brothers that beauty is never permanent. After many years, the signs of the great battle and the evidence of the inland sea had disappeared and there was happiness and contentment over the earth. The squaw mountain wished to come out of her cave and grew very lonely. In an effort to ease her loneliness, Soclai sent the Bats, a tribe of beautiful birds, to be her companions. Yi-east eventually learned that the Bats were her guardians and carried out secret communication with the squaw mountain through them. He befriended Loo-wit and crossed the bridge at night to meet with the squaw mountain. One night, he stayed too long and had to hurry to get back to his proper place. He caused the ground to shake so much in his haste that a large rock fell and blocked the entrance to the cave. When Soclai found this, he was furious with the Bats and punished them by turning them into bats that are seen today. He allowed the squaw mountain to remain out of the cave on her promise to be good, but would not allow her and Yi-east to be married, fearing the inevitable quarrel that might start again. He did promise to look for a mate for Pa-toe, hoping this would initiate a lasting peace. However, because of his many duties, he forgot this promise and the two mountains were only held in check by his threats. Eventually, when Soclai was {{in another part of the}} world, they resumed their quarrel and created chaos again. Their violence broke the Bridge of the Gods and destroyed the landscape again. Loo-wit, in her attempts to stop the two brothers, was badly burned and scarred; and when the bridge collapsed, she fell with it. Finally, Pa-toe won the battle and Yi-east admitted defeat. Soclai returned from where he had been, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late to avert the disaster. He found Loo-wit and because she had been faithful in her guardianship, he rewarded her by giving her her greatest desire, youth and beauty. Having received this gift, she moved to the west side of the Cascades and remains there to this day as Mount St. Helens. Since Pa-toe won the battle, the squaw mountain belonged to him. She was heart broken, but took her place at his side. She soon fell at his feet and into a deep sleep from which she never awoke. She is now known as Sleeping Beauty. Pa-toe became so sad that he caused her deep sleep, he lowered his own head in remorse.|$|E

25|$|The Australia XI {{match against}} the MCC {{used to be}} seen as {{virtually}} another Test match and important for the Australian selectors to see up and coming cricketers in action before choosing a team. For some reason in 1950–51 it was scheduled between the First and Second Tests and after the team for the latter had already been announced. Even if someone made a century or took ten wickets they could not be picked for the Australian team until the Third Test early in 1951, though Ken Archer and Jim Burke had been named in the XII and were fighting to avoid being the twelfth man. The game was held in Sydney as their rivals Melbourne were hosting two of the Tests. The Australian vice captain Arthur Morris was in charge on his home ground with local hero Keith Miller and the Victorian Neil Harvey who hardly needed testing. The batsmen Graeme Hole, wicket-keeper Gil Langley and bowlers Alan Walker, Geoff Noblet and Chris Langdon were also included, as was Ritchie Benaud, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> ill to play and was replaced by the veteran leg-spinner Doug Ring. Morris won the toss again and batted on a flat Sydney wicket, he added 170 with Ken Archer (81) before he was out for exactly 100, Harvey (40), Miller (62), Burke (128) and Hole (41) piled up the runs and Morris declared during the second day's tea interval for 526/9. John Warr (2/89) opened the bowling, Alec Bedser and Freddie Brown failed to take a wicket and Eric Hollies (3/108) and Bob Berry (2/108 off just 14 overs) could not contain the attack. The two spinners could not blame the fielding as they each dropped Morris of their own bowling, and Berry dropping him off Hollies. Alan Walker (5/60) and Doug Ring (3/106) reduced the MCC's reply to 47/3 by stumps and it was up to Denis Compton (115) and nightwatchman Godfrey Evans (31) to restore the innings with a partnership of 85, followed by another of 130 between Compton and Gilbert Parkhouse (58). Burke added to his credentials be taking a great catch in gully to dismiss a tired Compton, leaving Brown to punch 46 before the tail gave way five runs short of saving the follow on. Morris sent the MCC back in to bat and saw them fall to 22/2 before John Dewes (66 not out) and Parkhouse (46 not out) saved the day. Dewes retired hurt at 66/2, but returned after Compton was dismissed for 29 and they ended on 173/3. Although Jim Burke made the most runs he carried the drinks in the Second Test and Archer opened with Morris, but Burke was chosen for the Fourth Test at Adelaide and made a century on debut. Langley proved to be a competent keeper, but failed to oust Don Tallon despite the latter's lack of form. The results for Freddie Brown were more dire, Compton's knee had swollen again due to his exertions and he was unfit to play at Melbourne, Berry and Hollies had proved incapable of containing the Australian batsmen and Bedser and Brown has lost the form which had caught Australia out at Brisbane. The only good news was that John Dewes had shown his fighting abilities regardless of form and a fair crowd had come to watch, so increasing coffers of the MCC Manager John Nash.|$|E
