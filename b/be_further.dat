5|$|At least 30% of TBI are not {{discovered}} at first; this number {{may be as}} high as 50%. In about 10% of cases, TBI has no specific signs either clinically or on chest radiography, and its detection may <b>be</b> <b>further</b> complicated by concurrent injuries, since TBI tends to occur after high-energy accidents. Weeks or months may go by before the injury is diagnosed, even though the injury is better known {{than it was in the}} past.|$|E

Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1.5–4mm across. Rolling scars are wider than icepick and boxcar scars (4–5mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin.|$|E
5|$|CPG is {{commonly}} defined by its pore size. In oligonucleotide chemistry, pore sizes of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000Å {{are used to}} allow the preparation of about 50, 80, 100, 150, and 200-mer oligonucleotides, respectively. To make native CPG suitable for further processing, {{the surface of the}} material is treated with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane to give aminopropyl CPG. The aminopropyl arm may <b>be</b> <b>further</b> extended to result in long chain aminoalkyl (LCAA) CPG. The amino group is then used as an anchoring point for linkers suitable for oligonucleotide synthesis (see below).|$|E

5|$|Expression of Hsp90A also {{correlates}} with disease prognosis. Increased levels of Hsp90A {{are found in}} leukemia, breast and pancreatic cancers {{as well as in}} patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In human T-cells, HSP90AA1 expression is increased by the cytokines IL-2, IL-4 and IL-13. HSP90, alongside other conserved chaperones and co-chaperones that interact to safeguard proteostasis, is repressed in aging human brains. This repression was found to <b>be</b> <b>further</b> exacerbated in the brains of patients with age-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease.|$|E

The PC version supports multiplayer mode over the internet or a local area network (the original Unreal was mainly a single-player game).|$|E

5|$|In that article, he {{attempted}} to show how mental representations, specifically sentences {{in the language of}} thought, are necessary to explain this relational nature of mental states. Fodor considers two alternative hypotheses. The first completely denies the relational character of mental states and the second considers mental states as two-place relations. The latter position can <b>be</b> <b>further</b> subdivided into the Carnapian view that such relations are between individuals and sentences of natural languages and the Fregean view that they are between individuals and the propositions expressed by such sentences.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the riot}} {{appeared}} to increase {{public support for}} radical reform of the present degrading prison system. Some of that goodwill will have been eroded by the antics of the rioters {{in the last two}} weeks, and may <b>be</b> <b>further</b> eroded once details emerge during the forthcoming criminal prosecutions. But this must not deflect Home Office ministers from the road down which they had belatedly begun to travel. A change in prison conditions is crucial if good order is to be restored to the system.|$|E

5|$|Organisms differ {{according}} {{to the number of}} constructed molecules in their cells. Autotrophs such as plants can construct the complex organic molecules in cells such as polysaccharides and proteins from simple molecules like carbon dioxide and water. Heterotrophs, on the other hand, require a source of more complex substances, such as monosaccharides and amino acids, to produce these complex molecules. Organisms can <b>be</b> <b>further</b> classified by ultimate source of their energy: photoautotrophs and photoheterotrophs obtain energy from light, whereas chemoautotrophs and chemoheterotrophs obtain energy from inorganic oxidation reactions.|$|E
