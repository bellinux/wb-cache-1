5000|$|Jaguar {{first used}} the Dana 44 in an IRS in 1961 for the Jaguar E-type {{as well as}} other models. It was used through 1996 (Jaguar IRS Article). There are some {{differences}} in the Jaguar Dana 44, however. The differential (possibly the entire axle assembly) was made by Salisbury, a U.K. division of Dana Corporation. The ring gear in the Salisbury version uses slightly smaller mounting bolts and the pinion shaft is a different diameter than the common version. Naturally the cast housing is also unique to the IRS model. Standard 8.5" [...] Dana 44 ring and pinion gear can be used in the IRS model {{through the use of a}} special installation kit which includes special shouldered bolts to mount the standard ring gear to the IRS carrier and a special pinion <b>bearing</b> <b>set</b> to fit the standard pinion shaft to the IRS housing. Gear distributors with knowledge of the Jag IRS should be able to get the installation kit. US Dana 44 gears a slightly stronger than Jaguar gears, and Jaguar gears higher priced, but once the installation kit price is added to the lower US gear prices cost is about the same. If Jaguar makes the needed gear ratio there isn't much difference in strength. The consensus in the hot rodding community is that the Jaguar IRS is good for up to 500 hp from the factory. Most V-12 Jaguar and E-type six-cylinder models used limited slip versions, other models (mainly the XJS) used a standard differential stock with limited slip as an option.|$|E

40|$|Summary Carbohydrate and {{nitrogen}} contents, chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange were measured in leaves from both vegetative and reproductive terminal shoots of 12 -year-old flowering mango trees. Reproductive shoot leaves {{were close to}} swelling floral buds, inflorescences or panicles <b>bearing</b> <b>set</b> fruits. Leaves close to inflorescences had lower rates of mi-tochondrial respiration (Rd) and net photosynthesis (Anet), and lower stomatal conductance (gs) and quantum efficiency of photosystem II under actinic light than vegetative shoot leaves. Leaf nitrogen concentration, which decreased from the begin-ning {{until the end of}} flowering, was lower in leaves close to in-florescences than in vegetative shoot leaves. However, these differences and changes were counterbalanced by an increase in leaf mass-to-area ratio so that leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area (Na) remained nearly constant during the whole flowering pe-riod, except in leaves close to panicles <b>bearing</b> <b>set</b> fruits. Net CO 2 assimilation rate simulated by a biochemical model of leaf photosynthesis (Urban et al. 2003) was much higher than Anet measured at an ambient CO 2 partial pressure (Ca) of either 36 or 70 Pa. The overestimation of Anet was more pronounced in leaves close to inflorescences, to panicles <b>bearing</b> <b>set</b> fruits and to reversing inflorescences (characterized by the appearance of leaves in terminal positions on inflorescences) than in vegeta-tive shoot leaves. It is concluded that low Anet in leaves close to inflorescences was probably due neither to changes in Na nor to a decrease in Rubisco activity induced by low gs, but rather to a decrease in electron flow in photosystem II. This decrease was not directly associated with higher starch or soluble sugar con-tents...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} experimental test of a passive magnetic bearing system composed by a superconductor magnetic bearing (SMB) and a permanent magnet bearing (PMB). This bearing setup {{is part of a}} flywheel energy storage system. The advantage of using a passive bearing system is that it offers low friction without the need of a magnetic bearing controller, increasing the reliability and decreasing the energy consumption. The first set of tests were quasi-static radial and axial force measurements of the PMB operating alone and together with the SMB. As the PMB is intrinsically unstable in one degree of freedom, the operation of the SMB together with the PMB is necessary to stabilize the system. After that, dynamic measurements were made for the SMB operating alone and together with the PMB. The resonant speeds were identified and the bearing radial and axial forces were also measured for the SMB and SMB + PMB operation. These results indicate that the studied <b>bearing</b> <b>set</b> is technologically feasible to be used in flywheel energy storage systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} develop a new {{magnetic}} <b>bearing</b> <b>set</b> for a flywheel energy storage prototype, it was designed and simulated some configurations of Permanent Magnetic Bearings (PMB) and Superconducting Magnetic Bearings (SMB). The bearings were assembled with Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets and the simulations were carried out with the Finite Element Method (FEM). The PMB was designed to reduce the load on SMB and provide radial positioning of the whole set. SMB were designed with YBCO superconductors and an assembly of permanent magnets. Several configurations of permanent magnets were simulated, trying to maximize the magnetic flux gradient in direction or-thogonal to the movement and flux density in the surface of the superconductors. Early experiments have shown an increasing stiffness and levitation force with increasing field gradient and intensity. It was also a goal to reduce the stray field outside the bearing. The levitation force of the SMB using a flux shapers configuration was measured and compared with FEM simula-tion, showing very good agreement. The simulation of a SMB using Halbach array configuration shows that it increases the levitation force and reduces the stray field. Index Terms—Flywheel, magnetic bearing, superconducting levitation.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the effect of {{flowering}} on leaf photosynthesis. To understand why net photosynthesis (A(net)) is lower in Mangifera indica L. leaves close to inflorescences than in leaves on vegetative shoots, we measured nitrogen and carbohydrate concentrations, chlorophyll a fluorescence and gas exchange in recently matured leaves on vegetative terminals and on floral terminals of 4 -year-old trees. We used models to estimate photosynthetic electron fluxes and mesophyll conductance (g(m)). Lower A(net) in leaves close to developing inflorescences was attributable to substantial decreases in stomatal conductance and g(m), and also in photosynthetic capacity as indicated by the decrease in the light-saturated rate of photosynthetic electron transport (J(max)). The decrease in J(max) was the result of decreases in the amount of foliar nitrogen per unit leaf area, and may have been triggered by a decrease in sink activity as indicated by the increase in the hexose:sucrose ratio. Parameters measured on leaves close to panicles <b>bearing</b> <b>set</b> fruits were generally intermediate between those measured on leaves on vegetative shoots and on leaves close to inflorescences, suggesting that the changes in A(net) associated with flowering are reversible...|$|E

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{growth in the}} renewable energy sector to contribute to sustainable development, environmental conservation and most importantly to provide affordable energy to isolated rural communities of sub-Saharan Africa. Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind require energy storage since the source of energy is intermittent. Electrochemical batteries especially from lead acid are commonly used to store energy in Solar Home Systems (SHS) for rural electrification in sub-Saharan Africa. Disadvantages such as low efficiencies, low life cycle costs, high maintenance, comparatively short life and serious environmental and human toxicity effects exist. Since recycling is not widespread, replacement costs are high, as are the resultant environmental damage and health hazards from lead and sulphuric acid. In this thesis, an electromechanical flywheel energy storage device is proposed {{as an alternative to}} a lead acid battery in order to increase efficiency, life expectancy, increased high depth of discharge, low life cycle cost and elimination of adverse environmental effects. Due to income and service skill constraints in rural areas, the proposed, high speed flywheel systems (for long time energy storage) will require the use of low cost configurations and topologies, special considerations on the flywheel rotor profile design, robust electrical machines, simple power electronics and a low cost <b>bearing</b> <b>set.</b> Low loss magnetic bearings are also possible but were limited by time while also making their maintenance complex especially in rural areas. Conventional high strength composite materials used in flywheel rotor manufacture for high speed operation are expensive. Therefore {{there is a need to}} develop techniques to profile the rotor shape so as to improve on material usage and exhibit lower mechanical stresses. A robust electrical machine topology for high speed operation and a simple drive system are investigated to ensure simple assembly, low cost and low maintenance. vii The various flywheel components were designed using analytical and numerical methods. Two techniques were used to develop two optimal profiles for the flywheel rotor structure. Partial differential equations and analytical solutions were employed to develop the profiles. Analytical equations were used to design the electrical machine, drive, bearing system and other accessories. The final electromechanical battery prototype consisted of a composite flywheel rotor made from E-glass fibre materials, double rotor Axial Flux Permanent Magnet (AFPM) machine and a drive system using Brushless DC (BLDC) mode of operation. The system was designed for 300 Wh of energy storage for the delivery of 100 W and 500 W of power and an operating speed range of 8, 000 rpm- 25, 000 rpm. The design and development of the flywheel energy storage system and test rig using locally available materials was investigated. Experiments were conducted for speeds up to 6, 000 rpm. The electromechanical battery was able to store a maximum of 77 Wh of energy. The shortfall of the system to meet its design specifications was investigated and found to have been caused by vibrations resulting from prototyping issues. A thermal model was developed to predict the temperature rise in the system which showed a good correlation with the experimental results...|$|E
