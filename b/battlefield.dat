5|$|On the {{northern}} end of the <b>battlefield,</b> events had unfolded quite differently. Dampierre's cavalry routed Lannoy's company of light horse; the Italians and the contingent from Gruyères, meanwhile, broke and fled—leaving their officers to be killed—without offering any real resistance to the advancing Imperial infantry. As Cardona's infantry moved past the original French line, Enghien descended on it with the entire body of heavy cavalry under his command; the subsequent engagement took place on the reverse slope of the ridge, {{out of sight of the}} rest of the <b>battlefield.</b>|$|E
5|$|Part of the <b>battlefield</b> is now {{preserved}} in Princeton <b>Battlefield</b> State Park, which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. Another {{section of the}} <b>battlefield</b> adjacent to the state park is embroiled in a development controversy. The Institute for Advanced Study, which owns the property, is planning a housing project on land where George Washington charged with his men during the battle. Historians, the Department of the Interior and archaeological evidence confirm the land's significance. Several national and local preservation organizations are working to prevent construction on the property, and the Princeton <b>Battlefield</b> Society had legal action pending as of summer 2016. On December 12, 2016, the Civil War Trust announced they will purchase almost 15 acres of land from the Institute for Advanced Study. Seven of the planned single family dwellings will be replaced with townhouses. In total, 16 housing units will be constructed. The compromise is subject to approval by the Princeton Planning Board and Delaware and Raritan Canal Commission.|$|E
5|$|Sunrise was at 6:48am that morning, {{and reports}} of the day record that it was unusually bright. The weather {{conditions}} are not recorded. The route that the English army took to the <b>battlefield</b> is not known precisely. Several roads are possible: one, an old Roman road that ran from Rochester to Hastings has long been favoured because of a large coin hoard found nearby in 1876. Another possibility is a Roman road between London and Lewes and then over local tracks to the <b>battlefield.</b> Some accounts of the battle indicate that the Normans advanced from Hastings to the <b>battlefield,</b> but the contemporary account of William of Jumièges places the Normans {{at the site of}} the battle the night before. Most historians incline towards the former view, but M. K. Lawson argues that William of Jumièges's account is correct.|$|E
