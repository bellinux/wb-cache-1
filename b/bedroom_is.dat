5|$|The Princess of Wales <b>Bedroom</b> <b>is</b> {{named after}} {{the wife of the}} future King Edward VII, Alexandra, Princess of Wales, who stayed at Althorp in 1863 on a visit to see the Red Earl. Although the fabric of the four-poster bed was {{designed}} in 1911, the room is largely Georgian, with deep red walls and furnishings, and contains a notable portrait of a young princess by the Spanish court painter, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. The Queen Mary <b>Bedroom</b> <b>is</b> named after Mary, the wife of King George V, who visited Althorp in 1913. It contains a bed with an extremely tall structure, dated to the 18th century, draped in pea green taffet. Of particular note in the Queen Mary Bedroom are two chairs covered with needlework created by Albert, who was once the chairman of the Royal School of Needlework.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Misako Aoki in 2015, Kurosaki discussed the influence of lolita fashion on her work. Her life changed when she encountered lolita fashion, and modeling in the style would broaden her world {{and give her a}} sense of comfort. Kurosaki was inspired by the film Legally Blonde because of the film's main character always wearing what she wants to wear, and how the main character's <b>bedroom</b> <b>is</b> colored pastel pink, a color scheme that Kurosaki liked.|$|E
5|$|The {{relatively}} small study contains {{plans for the}} house and potential impressions for various elevations. One is reputed to have been drawn by Sir Francis Dashwood himself, while the Tapestry Room, once ante-room to the adjoining former principal <b>bedroom,</b> <b>is</b> hung with Brussels tapestries depicting peasant scenes by Teniers. Dashwood inherited them in 1763 from his uncle Lord Westmorland, {{who is said to}} have been given them by the 1st Duke of Marlborough to celebrate their victories in the Low Countries.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} Spanish Room, {{the library is}} the most {{atmospheric}} of rooms, upon the wall of which are hung the huge keys of the destroyed Corfe Castle, handed back to Mary Bankes after her defence of Corfe Castle during the Civil War. The state <b>bedroom</b> <b>is</b> extremely ornate and has housed such important guests as Kaiser Wilhelm II who stayed with the family for a week in 1907. The main staircase is beautifully carved from stone and features three huge statues which look out onto the gardens from their seats. These depict Sir John Bankes and Lady Bankes, the defenders of Corfe Castle, and their patron, Charles I.|$|E
5|$|The room to {{the east}} of the Oak <b>Bedroom</b> <b>is</b> known as The Great Room. The room was {{established}} in the mid 17th century as part of a reception suite, and was used by George John, the Second Earl for important political conferences during his period as First Lord of the Admiralty and Home Secretary. The Great Room, predominantly red and gold in design like many of the first floor rooms, contains a table and chairs with a large gilded mirror with three urns in front of it. The long mirror, designed by James Stuart, who was noted for his Athenian designs, features a tableaux at the top with the Spencer coat of arms and the pulling of chariots by cherubs, representing the love between John and Georgiana. The Great Room contains an extensive collection of miniature portraits, including a very rare Lucas de Heere portrait of Lady Jane Grey as a teenage girl at her family residence in Bradgate, Leicestershire. The Portrait of Isaak Abrahamsz. Massa is mentioned in the 1822 Bibliotheca Spenceriana as hanging in one of the bedrooms at Althorp. It was sold in 1924 to art merchant Joseph Duveen, who sold it the following year to Canadian businessman Frank P. Wood.|$|E
25|$|The Lincoln <b>Bedroom</b> <b>is</b> {{a bedroom}} {{which is part}} of a guest suite located in the {{southeast}} corner of {{the second floor of the}} White House in Washington, D.C. The Lincoln Sitting Room makes up the other part of the suite. The room is named for President Abraham Lincoln, who used the room as an office.|$|E

25|$|In the Pine Street house, Ward has a den {{near the}} main entry, {{which serves as}} a setting for many scenes. The garage at the Pine Street house is used less often as a setting for {{masculine}} get-togethers than the Mapleton Drive garage had been. June and Ward's <b>bedroom</b> <b>is</b> seen {{for the first time in}} the Pine Street house. They have their own bath, sleep in twin beds and have a portable TV in the room.|$|E
25|$|Archie's <b>bedroom</b> <b>is</b> {{one floor}} above Wolfe's, and {{his room and}} board at the brownstone are part of his compensation. On several occasions, he makes {{it a point to}} note that he owns his bedroom furniture. Except for breakfast (which chef Fritz Brenner {{generally}} serves him in the kitchen), Archie takes his meals at Wolfe's table, and has learned much about haute cuisine by listening to Wolfe and Fritz discuss food. While Archie has a cocktail on occasion, his beverage of choice is milk.|$|E
25|$|The Entrance Hall {{contains}} a white staircase {{leading to the}} second floor of the house with a wall of reflective mirrors. The floor features Elvis' bedroom at the southwest corner that connects to his dressing room and bath room in the northwest corner. His daughter Lisa Marie's <b>bedroom</b> <b>is</b> in the northeast corner, and a bedroom in the southeast corner served as Elvis' private personal office. The second floor is not open to visitors out of respect for the Presley family and partially to avoid any improper focus on the bathroom which was the site of his death. The floor has been untouched since the day Elvis died and is rarely seen by non-family members.|$|E
60|$|The {{silence in}} the <b>bedroom</b> <b>was</b> broken by a murmuring of women's voices outside the door.|$|R
50|$|In 1988, four residences {{for single}} {{students}} with 48 <b>bedrooms</b> <b>were</b> built to replace two older houses.|$|R
50|$|There are ten fireplaces, {{and those}} in the <b>bedrooms</b> <b>were</b> faced with carved marble {{imported}} from Italy.|$|R
25|$|There {{are four}} {{bedrooms}} {{and a small}} kitchenette upstairs. The master bedroom, where Mr. and Mrs. Adamson slept, is on {{the southwest corner of}} the house. It has a large tiled bathroom, and Mrs. Adamson's clothes and hat collection remain in her closet. Next to the master <b>bedroom</b> <b>is</b> the one designed for the Adamsons' son; its bathroom has detailed tiles depicting ships and nautical scenes. The girls' bedroom in the center facing the ocean has a tremendous view of the ocean and coast. These three bedrooms open onto a large upstairs patio with the home's most spectacular panoramic view of the ocean, the Malibu lagoon and the coast in both directions. The fourth bedroom upstairs is at the eastern end of the second floor and looks out of a large Dombeya tree that blooms with spectacular bright red flowers in the spring.|$|E
25|$|Richard Cotton's {{alterations}} to the Great Hall (now the library) {{are thought}} to include concealing the hammerbeam roof with a plaster ceiling and putting in a fireplace. Timbers {{in one of the}} bedrooms have been dated to around this time. It is unclear whether he installed a grand staircase to access the Hall, which is on the first floor. The room's existing screen is believed to date from somewhat later; it is known to have been moved at some point from its original northern position to {{the south side of the}} Hall, where it now stands. William III stayed at the house in 1690, while travelling to the Battle of the Boyne, and his visit may have been the cause of internal reorganisation. The room where the king is thought to have slept, known as the Orange <b>Bedroom,</b> <b>is</b> adjacent to the Great Hall; its timbers have been dated to 1546–81. There is also evidence for building work in around 1725.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to other popular comedies {{of the era}} (such as Father Knows Best, Leave It to Beaver, and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet), which depicted their characters in comfortable, middle class suburban environments, the set design for The Honeymooners reflected the blue collar existence of its characters. The Kramdens lived in a small, painfully sparsely furnished two-room apartment (the main set) in a tenement building at least four stories high (the Kramdens were {{on the third floor}} and the Nortons' were one floor above them), badly aired and with insufficient lighting. They used the single main room as the kitchen, dining and living room. It consisted of a functional table and chairs, a plain chest of drawers, a curtainless window with a view of a fire escape, a noisy sink, and an outdated icebox. The Kramdens' bedroom never was seen, although in the episode about Ed Norton's sleepwalking the Nortons' <b>bedroom</b> <b>is.</b> One of the few other sitcoms about a blue collar family was The Life of Riley, whose first season (1949–50) had featured Jackie Gleason in the lead role, although veteran movie actor William Bendix, who had originated the role of Chester A. Riley on the radio show, thereafter took over the role on television.|$|E

500|$|The family <b>bedroom</b> <b>is</b> {{located at}} one end of the car's lower level and {{measures}} [...] × [...] It can hold up to two adults and two children in four berths. During the day the berths form a sofa and two seats. At the opposite end of the car from the family <b>bedroom</b> <b>is</b> the accessible bedroom, which measures [...] × [...] It sleeps two people in two berths and includes a wheelchair-accessible toilet, but no shower.|$|E
500|$|The Green State <b>bedroom</b> <b>is</b> the {{principal}} bedroom; it {{is decorated with}} paintings and tapestries, including works by Paul Saunders and George Smith Bradshaw. It is said that when Queen Mary visited, Gavin Hamilton's [...] "lewd" [...] depiction of Jupiter Caressing Juno [...] "was considered unsuitable for that lady's eyes and was banished to the attics".|$|E
500|$|This <b>bedroom</b> <b>is</b> {{also less}} richly ornamented than {{many in the}} castle, making {{extensive}} use of plain, stencilled geometrical patterns on the walls. Crook suggested this provided some [...] "spartan" [...] relief before {{the culmination of the}} castle in Lady Bute's Bedroom but Floud considered the result [...] "thin" [...] and drab in comparison with the more richly decorated chambers. The bedroom would have been impractical for regular use, lacking wardrobes and other storage.|$|E
50|$|The {{rumbling}} on {{the other}} side of Elmer's <b>bedroom</b> <b>was</b> reused in a later cartoon, The Wabbit Who Came to Supper.|$|R
60|$|Five {{minutes after}} this casual survey <b>was</b> made his <b>bedroom</b> <b>was</b> empty, and its {{occupant}} had vanished quietly from the house.|$|R
50|$|In 1922, two <b>bedrooms</b> <b>were</b> added upstairs, as were servants' {{quarters}} on {{the ground}} floor. May died in 1936 and the house remained empty for six years, not selling until 1942. Sold again in 1945, carports and additional entrances were added, and the <b>bedroom</b> additions <b>were</b> rented out.|$|R
500|$|Two ornate palace {{buildings}} were built of rosewood in this compound in 1871 {{on the former}} site of the Manjakamiadana royal idol residence. The first and larger of the two, Fandriampahalemana, features a room for receiving visitors and a large salon on the ground floor, and the bedrooms of Queen Ranavalona II and her serving lady on the second floor. [...] The original European furnishings have been preserved, and the many gifts given by foreign dignitaries to the queen are on display here. The queen's <b>bedroom</b> <b>is</b> considered a sacred place and many visitors come on pilgrimage to pray to her spirit.|$|E
500|$|The <b>bedroom</b> <b>is</b> Moorish in style, {{a popular}} {{inspiration}} in mid-Victorian interior design, and echoes earlier work by Burges in the Arab Room at Cardiff Castle {{and in the}} chancel at St Mary's Church at Studley Royal in Yorkshire. Lilwall-Smith likened the chamber, with its [...] "Moorish-looking dome, maroon-and-gold painted furniture and large, low bed decorated with glass crystal orbs", to {{a scene from the}} Arabian Nights. Peter Floud criticised the eclectic nature of this Moorish theme and contrasted it unfavourably with the more consistent style Burges applied to the Arab Room, suggesting that it gave the bedroom an overly theatrical, even pantomime-like, character. The historian Matthew Williams considered that Lonsdale's efforts lack the imagination and flair that Burges himself might have brought to the room.|$|E
500|$|The Oak <b>Bedroom</b> <b>is</b> at {{the rear}} of the house, on the western side between King William Bedroom and the Great Room. The {{marriage}} of the first Earl Spencer and Margaret Georgiana took place in secret here on 20 December 1755, during a ball which was taking place at Althorp to celebrate John's 21st birthday. Georgiana later recalled, [...] "We both behaved very well, spoke distinctly and loudly but I trembled so much I could hardly stand". As of 1998 it was furnished with deep red wall paper, rug and chairs, with oak floors, bed and chairs. There are several portraits on the wall, one of them very large above the fireplace. The Spencer [...] "S" [...] features on the blue velvet bed cover, and above the king-sized bed and by the fireplace.|$|E

50|$|The Small Oak Room and <b>Bedroom</b> <b>are</b> {{contemporary}} {{with the}} Great Oak Room but much less richly panelled. The Bedroom has the moulded plaster ceiling {{upon which the}} knot garden’s design is based. The common layout of Tudor rooms in an apartment with people travelling from most public to most intimate suggests that the Great Oak Room was the most public room whilst the Small Oak Room and <b>Bedroom</b> <b>were</b> more private antechambers, possibly bedrooms and cabinets.|$|R
