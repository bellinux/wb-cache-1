25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1968, Kaplan enlisted {{help from}} Dan Byer, a retired {{engineer}} from AMC, {{for the development of}} a new <b>block</b> <b>casting.</b> Using the basic AMC 390 drawings, they added more mass for four-bolt mains and improved the oiling system. A run of 50 blocks was contracted to Central Foundries in Windsor, Ontario. Because this was a small run, and there was little factory support, it fell to Kaplan and his staff to clean up the blocks from the sand casting, hone the various passages and, finally, send them to AMC’s “Parts Central” in Kenosha. From there, they could draw on the inventory, as required.|$|E

50|$|V engines {{remained}} {{with a separate}} <b>block</b> <b>casting</b> for each bank. The complex ducting required for inlet manifolds between the banks were too complicated to cast otherwise. For economy, a few engines, such as the V12 Pierce-Arrow, were designed to use identical castings for each bank, left and right. Some rare engines, such as the Lancia 22½° narrow-angle V12 of 1919, did use a single <b>block</b> <b>casting</b> for both banks.|$|E
50|$|A {{version of}} NASCAR V8 {{cylinder}} <b>block</b> <b>cast</b> in Compacted Graphite Iron by Grainger & Worrall won the UK's Casting of the Year Award 2010.|$|R
5000|$|The 400 V8's for {{the model}} years 1971-72 were either cast in the Dearborn Iron Foundry or the Cleveland Foundry. Those built for model years 1973-79 were either cast in the Cleveland Foundry or the Michigan Casting Center. [...] The 351M {{introduced}} in 1975 shared the same block as the 400. The 351M and 400 <b>blocks</b> <b>cast</b> at the Michigan Casting Center prior to March 2, 1977 experienced water jacket cracking problems above the lifter bores. The cracking was caused by an internal coring problem when the <b>blocks</b> were <b>cast.</b> The result was horizontal cracks approximately 1" [...] above the lifter bore. [...] After March 2, 1977 the <b>blocks</b> <b>cast</b> at Michigan Casting Center did not have problems with cracking.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We study {{multicrystalline}} silicon (mc-Si) <b>block</b> <b>cast</b> wafer {{solar cell}} material {{with respect to}} mechanical residual stresses at grain boundaries (GBs) related to GB type, details of microstructure, and electrical activity of the GBs. For this purpose we combine micro-Raman spectroscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and electron beam induced current techniques. Stresses of several tens of MPa are found not to influence the electrical activity in <b>block</b> <b>cast</b> mc-Si. Inhomogeneous distributions of residual stresses and electrical activity are observed along the same GB as well as along different GBs of the same type. These results are {{discussed in terms of}} local variations in the GB microstructure due to the presence of dislocations superimposed on the GB, their arrangement, intrinsic structure, and impurity decoration...|$|R

5000|$|It was {{introduced}} in two piston displacement sizes in 1960: The 170 cuin L [...] "LG" [...] (Low-G, referring to the relatively short engine <b>block</b> <b>casting</b> and crankshaft stroke) in the Valiant, and the 225 cuin L [...] "RG" [...] (Raised-G, referring to the relatively tall engine <b>block</b> <b>casting</b> and crankshaft stroke) in full-size Plymouth and Dodge Dart models. In 1960, the engine was called the [...] "30-D Economy Six" [...] engine by Plymouth marketers, referring to the 30° cylinder block angle.|$|E
5000|$|... 1956 - Full-flow oil {{filtration}} was introduced, using a paper element filter in a canister that was mounted to a boss that {{was added to}} the left rear cylinder <b>block</b> <b>casting</b> and machined for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|Moir {{produced}} a design for concrete machine-gun pillboxes. Designed to be constructed from {{a system of}} interlocking precast concrete blocks, with a steel roof, around 1500 Moir pillboxes were eventually produced (with <b>blocks</b> <b>cast</b> at Richborough in Kent) {{and sent to the}} Western Front in 1918.|$|R

5000|$|... 1958 - Bosses {{for side}} motor mounts {{were added to}} the <b>block</b> <b>casting,</b> {{utilized}} for production mounts for this and all future model years. However, the features for front motor mounts as used in 1955-1957 remained part of the <b>block</b> <b>casting</b> in this and future years. The 265-cubic-inch version of the engine was discontinued. Also, the cylinder head valve cover mounting bolt holes were changed from the top row staggered (relative to the bottom row of bolts) to the [...] "straight-across" [...] pattern that remained the way of identifying the early heads from the newer ones with a valve cover design which lasted until the 1987 center-bolt-style covers.|$|E
50|$|The endemic {{problem of}} {{crankshaft}} failure was later attributed to flexing of the crankcase - because the E-series relied upon the heavy sump/transmission unit to give additional strength to the cylinder <b>block</b> <b>casting,</b> this caused problems when a plain sump was bolted in its place.|$|E
50|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1933 to improve its {{breathing}} the engine was given a cross-flow head with inlet and exhaust manifolds on opposing sides. The <b>block</b> <b>casting</b> was redesigned to increase its stiffness and the Special received the long wheelbase underslung chassis and other modifications of the saloon including freewheel.|$|E
50|$|Polk {{won by a}} mere 5,106 out of 470,062 cast in New York, {{and only}} 3,422 out of 52,096 votes in Michigan. Had enough of these voting <b>blocks</b> <b>cast</b> their ballots for the anti-annexationist Clay in either state, he would have {{defeated}} Polk. Still, Clay's opposition to annexation and western slavery expansion served him well among Northern Whigs and nearly secured him the election.|$|R
50|$|Some pillboxes were {{designed}} to be prefabricated and transported to their location for assembly. During World War I, Sir Ernest William Moir produced a design for concrete machine-gun pillboxes constructed from a system of interlocking precast concrete blocks, with a steel roof. Around 1500 Moir pillboxes were eventually produced (with <b>blocks</b> <b>cast</b> at Richborough in Kent) {{and sent to the}} Western Front in 1918.|$|R
2500|$|The weights are {{generally}} made of lead {{because of its}} high density, reasonably low cost, ease of casting into suitable shapes, and resistance to corrosion. The lead can be <b>cast</b> in <b>blocks,</b> <b>cast</b> shapes with slots for straps, or shaped as pellets often named [...] "shot" [...] and carried in bags. There is some concern that lead diving weights may constitute a toxic hazard to users and environment.|$|R
50|$|The Mark III Sprite {{was also}} marketed as the Mark II MG Midget - {{differences}} between the two were again restricted to minor trim detailing. Although still 1098 cc, the engine had a stronger <b>block</b> <b>casting,</b> {{and the size of the}} crankshaft main bearings was increased to two inches (engine code 10CC).|$|E
50|$|The {{redesigned}} A13 is a 1.3-liter engine. It {{used the}} same basic <b>block</b> <b>casting</b> as the A12 and same stroke of 70 mm, but used a 76 mm bore for a displacement of 1,270 cc. This engine was also used as the base {{for a number of}} Formula Pacific and Formula 3 race engines.|$|E
5000|$|The FE and FT {{engines are}} Y-block designs - [...] {{so-called}} because the cylinder <b>block</b> <b>casting</b> extends below the crankshaft centerline, giving great rigidity {{and support to}} the crankshaft's bearings. In these engines, the casting extends 3.625 in below the crankshaft centerline, {{which is more than}} an inch below the bottom of the crank journals.|$|E
5000|$|All VAM engines were of AMC design, but {{built in}} Mexico. Moreover, VAM added unique {{engineering}} features {{to deal with}} low octane fuel and high altitudes. This included a 282 cuin L I6 engine (essentially a 258 <b>block</b> <b>cast</b> with a 0.16" [...] larger bore) not available from AMC. The larger six helped counter high altitude/low octane fuel power loss and {{with the lack of}} a V8 engine option in VAM produced vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|... 1905 {{brought a}} new car that was again bigger and which {{provided}} the only offering from the small Cleveland manufacturer. It was a huge automobile with a four-cylinder L-head engine with a <b>block</b> <b>cast</b> in pairs and mechanical operated side valves delivering 40 HP. Wheelbase of 118 inches (300 cm). It was called the model 32/40 and was available as a very expensive 7-passenger Touring that set a buyer back a hefty $4,150.|$|R

5000|$|The 406 engine used a new 4.13 in bore {{with the}} 390's 3.785 in stroke, giving a {{displacement}} of 405.7 cuin L, rounded up to [...] "406" [...] for the official designation. The larger bore required a new <b>block</b> <b>casting</b> design allowing for thicker walls, but otherwise {{was very similar}} to the 390 block.|$|E
50|$|The BSA Royal Star was a Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) {{motorcycle}} {{whose new}} engine design {{paved the way}} for a range of successful unit construction twins. As well as giving a clean look to the engine, with the pushrod passages part of the cylinder <b>block</b> <b>casting,</b> unit construction reduced the number of places oil could leak from.|$|E
5000|$|As casting {{techniques}} improved, {{an entire}} cylinder block of 4, 6, or 8 cylinders could be cast as one. This was a simpler construction, thus less expensive (unit-wise) to make. For straight engines, {{this meant that}} one engine block could now comprise all the cylinders plus the crankcase. Monobloc straight fours, uncommon when the Ford Model T was introduced with one in 1908, became common during the next decade, and monobloc straight sixes followed soon after. By the mid-1920s, both were common, and the straight sixes of General Motors (along with other features that differentiated GM's various makes and models from the Model T) were prying market share away from Ford. (These were all flathead designs.) During that decade, V engines retained a separate <b>block</b> <b>casting</b> for each cylinder bank, with both bolted onto a common crankcase (itself a separate casting). For economy, some engines were designed to use identical castings for each bank, left and right. The complex ducting required for intake and exhaust was too complicated to allow {{the integration of the}} banks, except on a few rare engines, such as the Lancia 22½° narrow-angle V12 of 1919, that did manage to use a single <b>block</b> <b>casting</b> for both banks. The hurdles of integrating the banks of the V for common, affordable cars were first overcome by the Ford Motor Company with its Ford flathead V-8, introduced in 1932, which was the first V-8 with a single engine <b>block</b> <b>casting,</b> putting an affordable V-8 into an affordable car for the first time.|$|E
50|$|All 4.6 L 4-valve engines {{featured}} aluminum engine blocks with 6-bolt {{main bearing}} caps, {{the only exception}} being the 2003 - 2004 SVT Cobra which had a 4-bolt main <b>cast</b> iron <b>block.</b> The 1999 and earlier engines featured an aluminum <b>block</b> <b>cast</b> in Italy by Fiat subsidiary Teksid S.p.A. Since 1996, all of the 4.6 L 4-valve engines manufactured {{for use in the}} SVT Cobra have been hand-built by SVT technicians at Ford's Romeo, Michigan plant.|$|R

50|$|The Rife House is a {{historic}} house at 1515 South Eighth Street in Rogers, Arkansas. It is a modest single-story house, built out of concrete <b>blocks</b> <b>cast</b> to resemble rusticated stone. It has a gable-on-hip roof, with a shed-roof extension to the rear, and a full-width porch across the front. The porch is supported by four fluted columns fashioned out of concrete blocks. Built c. 1920, this is a well-preserved local example of a vernacular house built using a once-popular construction material.|$|R
5000|$|The BSA A65 Star was a Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) {{motorcycle}} {{aimed at}} the US market for unit construction twins. As well as giving a clean look to the engine, with the pushrod passages part of the cylinder <b>block</b> <b>casting,</b> unit construction {{reduced the number of}} places oil could leak from. [...] A range of A65 Star twins was produced between 1962 and 1972.|$|E
5000|$|With its 4.235" [...] bore size, the 427 {{block was}} {{expensive}} to manufacture as the slightest shifting of the casting cores {{could make a}} <b>block</b> <b>casting</b> unusable. Therefore, Ford combined attributes that had worked well in previous incarnations of the FE [...] - [...] a 3.985 in stroke and a 4.135 in bore [...] - [...] to create an easier-to-make engine with nearly identical displacement. The 428 cuin L engine used a cast nodular iron crankshaft and external balancer.|$|E
50|$|While an {{evolution}} of the RA IV and H.O. engine designs, the 455 SD was a much improved engine. In addition to the more refined cylinder heads, <b>block</b> <b>casting</b> reinforcements in the lifter galley and main bearing oil pan rail area along {{with the addition of}} forged connecting rods with larger 7/16 in bolts, the SD was made with a provision for dry sump oiling from the factory. This truly was a racing engine, detuned for use in passenger cars.|$|E
5000|$|The Chelsea House Livery Stable is {{a two-story}} {{structure}} located at 110 Jackson Street. [...] It was built from concrete <b>blocks</b> <b>cast</b> on-site, and contains 10200 sq ft of space. It {{was built in}} 1905-1906 as a place for travelers on the nearby train line to stable horses. [...] It was later converted into a shop for the next-door auto dealership, housed in the Mack Building/Daniels Showroom. The building was vacant for years; in 2008 the Chelsea Downtown Development Authority purchased it and proposed demolition.|$|R
5000|$|... 1907 was {{the last}} {{year in which the}} company offered but one single model. Again, it was a new one, and again, it was the largest and most {{powerful}} yet. The 30/60 rode on a 120-inch (3048 mm). It had a massive T-head four-cylinder engine with the cylinder <b>block</b> <b>cast</b> in pairs, displacing 536 c.i. (8783 cc) and delivering 60 HP. There were two body styles available: a Touring with either 5 or 7 seats for $4,500 each, and a 7-passenger Pullman at $4,759.|$|R
50|$|The 2.4-litre V6 had bore {{and stroke}} {{respectively}} of 92.5 mm and 60 mm, for a total displacement of 2,418 cc. The redesigned engine <b>block</b> was <b>cast</b> iron.|$|R
