As the bolt travels forward it seals off the feed port and 'uncorks' from the dump chamber.

50|$|Before the Model 1867 was {{put into}} full production, the rifle designer, Friedrich Vetterli, updated the rifle by {{replacing}} the external hammer with an internal cocking <b>bolt</b> <b>spring,</b> rounded front barrel band and placing the cleaning rod {{on the left side}} of the rifle. It was discovered soon after that the cleaning rod in its current placement was easily damaged and was subsequently moved to the under-barrel position. The model was designated the Model 1869.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{installation}} of the P3/P4 Truss to the ISS by the Canadarm2, Tanner and Stefanyshyn-Piper began their spacewalk to activate the truss at 09:17 UTC. During the EVA they installed power and data cables between the P1 & P3/P4 trusses, released the P3/P4 truss' launch restraints {{and a number of other}} tasks to configure the truss for upcoming activities. The spacewalk was so successful that the astronauts carried out a number of tasks scheduled for later EVAs, with the eventual completion of the EVA at 15:43 UTC. A <b>bolt,</b> <b>spring</b> and washer assembly from a launch lock was lost during these extra activities and floated off into space.|$|E

40|$|In {{applications}} {{where the}} combination of high strength and good corrosion resistance are required, {{there have been only}} a few alloys of choice. A new powder metallurgy alloy has been developed, PM 625 M, a niobium modification of Alloy 625, as a material to fill this need. One area of particular interest is the nuclear power industry, where many problems have been encountered with <b>bolts,</b> <b>springs,</b> and guidepins. Mechanical properties and stress corrosion cracking data of PM 625 M are presented in this paper...|$|R
50|$|Other {{industries}} followed, such as {{galvanized iron}} manufacturers John Lysaght & Co., (1921), Rylands Bros (wire, nails, rivets, <b>bolts,</b> <b>springs</b> etc.), tubemakers Stewarts & Lloyds (1934), and the Newcastle Chemical Co., (1940), and sited themselves {{adjacent to the}} steel works. The result was pollution which began to affect Mayfield which lost its fashionable status. The housing erected during and after World War I was overwhelmingly for those with employment in the heavy industries. The Steel Works finally closed down in the late 1990s and this had a knock on effect with adjacent industries, several of whom were now struggling with developing world markets.|$|R

50|$|A dead bolt, {{deadbolt}} or {{dead lock}} is a locking mechanism distinct from a <b>spring</b> <b>bolt</b> lock because a deadbolt cannot {{be moved to}} the open position except by rotating the lock cylinder with the key. The more common <b>spring</b> <b>bolt</b> lock uses a spring to hold the bolt in place, allowing retraction by applying force to the bolt itself. A deadbolt can therefore make a door more resistant to entry without the correct key.|$|R

5000|$|Universal Firearms of Hialeah, Fla. - Early Universal guns were, {{like other}} manufacturers, {{assembled}} from USGI parts. However, beginning in 1968, {{the company began}} producing the [...] "New Carbine", which externally resembled the M1 but {{was in fact a}} completely new firearm internally, using a different receiver, bolt carrier, <b>bolt,</b> recoil <b>spring</b> assembly, etc. with almost no interchangeability with GI-issue carbines. Universal was acquired by Iver Johnson in 1983 and moved to Jacksonville, Ark. in 1985.|$|R

50|$|Swedish company Interdynamic AB of Stockholm {{designed}} the Interdynamic MP-9 9mm submachine gun. Interdynamic intended {{it as an}} inexpensive submachine gun based on the Carl Gustav M/45 for military applications, but did not find a government buyer, so it {{was taken to the}} US market as an open-bolt semi-automatic pistol. The open-bolt design was deemed too easy to convert to full auto. Because of this, the ATF forced Interdynamic to redesign it into a closed-bolt system, which was harder to convert to full auto. This variant was called the KG-99. It made frequent appearances on Miami Vice, where it was legally converted to full auto by Title II manufacturers. The KG-9 and KG-99 have an open-end upper receiver tube where the <b>bolt,</b> recoil <b>springs,</b> and buffer plate are held in place by the plastic/polymer lower receiver frame. This design only allows for 115 grain 9mm ammunition. If heavier grain ammunition or hot loads are used, the plastic lower receiver will fail or crack, rendering the firearm unusable. The later model TEC-9 and AB-10 have a threaded upper receiver tube at the rear and a screw-on end cap to contain the <b>bolt,</b> recoil <b>spring,</b> and buffer plate even if removed from the lower receiver. This solves the problem of lower receiver failure when using hot ammo.|$|R

25|$|The 1928 variant can be {{disassembled}} easily {{by first}} detaching the stock, then sliding off the lower receiver and then simply removing the internal parts, cleaning them, and then putting it back together.

5000|$|The {{machine gun}} has an automatic-only trigger {{mechanism}} and a cross-bolt {{safety in the}} form of a button that is operated by the shooting hand (in its [...] "safe" [...] position the bolt release is disabled).
