The Byzantines responded to this threat by concentrating their units at Ajnadyn (a place in Palestine, probably al-Lajjun) from different garrisons. This move tied down the Muslim troops at border regions, as with this large force at their rear, Muslim armies were no longer free to march to central or northern Syria.|$|E

5|$|The aim of {{the first}} season's depot-laying was to place a series of depots on the Barrier from its edge (Safety Camp) down to 80°S, for use on the polar journey which would begin the {{following}} spring.

The work was to <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> 12men, the 8fittest ponies, and two dog teams; ice conditions prevented {{the use of the}} motor sledges.|$|E

5|$|The {{execution}} of Gardner at Utah State Prison {{became the focus}} of media attention in June 2010, {{because it was the first}} to <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> firing squad in the United States in 14years. Gardner stated that he sought this method of execution because of his Mormon background. On the day before his execution, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints released a statement clarifying its position on the issue of blood atonement of individuals. The case also attracted debate over capital punishment and whether Gardner had been destined for a life of violence since his difficult childhood.|$|E
5|$|The glider {{pilots were}} the first group to leave 'D' Company, their {{expertise}} being required for other planned operations. In particular Operation Comet, which included another coup-de-main operation where eighteen gliders {{would be used to}} capture three bridges in the Netherlands. The mission would <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the 1st Airborne Division with a brigade allocated to defend each bridge. Comet was scheduled for the 8September 1944, but was delayed and then cancelled. The plans were adapted, and became Operation Market Garden. This operation would involve three airborne divisions, however the coup-de-main assault plans were not carried out.|$|E
5|$|Borchgrevink's {{expedition}} objectives comprised commercial, {{scientific and}} geographical goals. He considered forming {{a company to}} exploit the extensive guano deposits that he had observed during his 1894–95 voyage, but this came to nothing. In numerous addresses to scientific societies, he stressed the extent of work that could <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> a resident expedition, including the possibility of establishing {{the location of the}} South Magnetic Pole. The team of scientists that Borchgrevink appointed, though inexperienced, covered a wide range of disciplines—magnetism, meteorology, biology, zoology, taxidermy and cartography. Borchgrevink also hoped that the expedition's scientific achievements could be matched by spectacular geographical discoveries and journeys, even perhaps an attempt on the geographical South Pole itself. With no knowledge of the continent's geography, he was unaware that the site of the base at Cape Adare would rule out any serious exploration of the Antarctic interior.|$|E

5|$|Homing on the enemy's {{broadcasts}} {{meant that}} there was no accurate way to calculate the range to the target; radar ranging measurements are based on timing the delay between broadcast and reception, {{and there was no way}} to know when the enemy's signal was originally broadcast. This meant that the homing device could only be used for the initial tracking, and the final approach would have to <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> radar. The extra range of the Mk. VIII was not required in this role as Serrate would bring the fighter within easy tracking range, and the loss of a Mk. IV would not reveal the secret of the magnetron to the Germans. For this reason, the Mk. IV was considered superior to the newer radars for this role, in spite of any technical advantages of the newer designs.|$|E

5|$|In {{supporting}} Calvin's {{proposals for}} reforms, {{the council of}} Geneva passed the Ordonnances ecclésiastiques (Ecclesiastical Ordinances) on 20 November 1541. The ordinances defined four orders of ministerial function: pastors to preach and to administer the sacraments; doctors to instruct believers in the faith; elders to provide discipline; and deacons {{to care for the}} poor and needy. They also called for the creation of the Consistoire (Consistory), an ecclesiastical court composed of the lay elders and the ministers. The city government retained the power to summon persons before the court, and the Consistory could judge only ecclesiastical matters having no civil jurisdiction. Originally, the court had the power to mete out sentences, with excommunication as its most severe penalty. The government contested this power and on 19 March 1543 the council decided that all sentencing would <b>be</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the government.|$|E
