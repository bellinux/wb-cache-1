40|$|Purpose: Routine toothbrushing is the {{principal}} method by which in-dividuals remove plaque and control plaque-related diseases, such as periodontitis and caries. Oral health care professionals generally rec-ommend at least 2 minutes brushing with an appropriate technique, and yet the average brushing time {{in the general population}} is closer to 45 seconds. Our understanding of the relationship between brushing time and plaque removal, in an untutored general population using a conventional manual toothbrush and dentifrice, is limited. The role of dentifrice in plaque removal is also unclear. Methods: This study was undertaken to measure plaque removal dur-ing untutored brushing over timed periods between 30 and 180 seconds with 1. 5 g dentifrice, using an Aquafresh Flex ® brush and Aquafresh Advanced ® dentifrice. Plaque removal after brushing without dentifrice was also determined (at the 60 second time point only). Forty-seven subjects participated in the study, in which plaque level was assessed using the Quigley-Hein (Turesky-modification) Index. Results: Plaque removal increased with brushing time across the range studied, tending towards a maximum at longer brushing times. At the extremes, <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 180 seconds removed 55 % more plaque than <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 30 seconds. <b>Brushing</b> <b>for</b> 120 seconds removed 26 % more plaque than <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 45 seconds. The use of dentifrice did not increase plaque removal during 60 seconds of brushing. Conclusions: Oral health care professionals should reinforce efforts to persuade patients to <b>brush</b> <b>for</b> longer periods of time, as increasing brushing time to the consensus minimum of 2 minutes from a more typical 45 seconds increases plaque removal to an extent likely to pro-vide clinically significant oral health benefits...|$|R

5000|$|Routine tooth {{brushing}} is {{the principal}} method of preventing many oral diseases, {{and perhaps the most}} important activity an individual can practice to reduce plaque buildup. Controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from plaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries - the three most common oral diseases. The average <b>brushing</b> time <b>for</b> individuals is between 30 seconds and just over 60 seconds. Many oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for a minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day. <b>Brushing</b> <b>for</b> at least two minutes per session is optimal for preventing the most common oral diseases, and removes considerably more plaque than <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> only 45 seconds ...|$|R

The one-knot <b>brush</b> <b>for</b> cornices and other moldings and the two-knot and brassbound <b>brushes</b> <b>for</b> flat surfaces are usually employed for distempering and whitewashing.

40|$|Microbial biofilms {{are mainly}} implicated in {{etiopathogenesis}} of caries and periodontal disease. Owing to its properties, these pose great challenges. Continuous and regular disruption of these biofilms is imperative for prevention {{and management of}} oral diseases. This study was done to {{understand the relationship between}} brushing time and plaque removal, in an untutored general population using a conventional manual toothbrush and dentifrice. Methods: The present study was undertaken to measure plaque removal by brushing over time periods between 30, 45, 60, 120 and 180 seconds with 1. 5 g dentifrice. (FULLSTOP) colgate 360 ° whole mouth clean tooth brush and Colgate total tooth paste were used in this study. Fourty subjects participated in the study, in which plaque level was assessed using the QuigleyHein (Turesky-modification) Index. Results: The study showed increased plaque removal with increased brushing time,Plaque removal significantly improved while <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 180 seconds when compared to <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 30 seconds. Conclusions: Oral health care professionals should motivate patients to <b>brush</b> <b>for</b> longer periods of time. A minimum duration of 2 minutes or more should be advised to the patients instead of 45 seconds. Special emphasis should be given in motivating all patients to brush of 2 minutes or more for plaque removal. Patients undergoing orthodontic treatment should also be advised <b>for</b> <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> the stipulated time as plaque retention in such patients can hamper the final result...|$|R
40|$|Objectives The {{influence}} of toothbrushing duration and dentifrice quantity on fluoride efficacy against dental caries is poorly understood. This study investigated {{effects of these}} two oral hygiene factors on enamel remineralisation (measured as surface microhardness recovery [SMHR]), enamel fluoride uptake (EFU), and net acid resistance (NAR) post-remineralisation in a randomized clinical study using an in situ caries model. Methods Subjects (n = 63) wore their partial dentures holding partially demineralised human enamel specimens and <b>brushed</b> twice-daily <b>for</b> two weeks, following each of five regimens: <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 120 or 45 s with 1. 5 g of 1150 ppm F (as NaF) dentifrice; for 120 or 45 s with 0. 5 g of this dentifrice; and for 120 s with 1. 5 g of 250 ppm F (NaF) dentifrice. Results Comparing <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 120 s against <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 45 s, SMHR and EFU increased by 20. 0 % and 26. 9 % respectively when 1. 5 g dentifrice was used; and by 22. 8 % and 19. 9 % respectively when 0. 5 g dentifrice was used. Comparing brushing with 1. 5 g against brushing with 0. 5 g dentifrice, SMHR and EFU increased by 35. 3 % and 51. 3 % respectively when <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 120 s, and by 38. 4 % and 43. 0 % respectively when <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 45 s. Increasing brushing duration and dentifrice quantity also increased the NAR value. The effects of these two oral hygiene factors on SMHR, EFU, and NAR were statistically significant (p < 0. 05 in all cases). Conclusion Brushing duration and dentifrice quantity {{have the potential to}} influence the anti-caries effectiveness of fluoride dentifrices. Study NCT 01563172 on ClinicalTrials. gov. Clinical significance The effect of two key oral hygiene regimen factors – toothbrushing duration and dentifrice quantity – on fluoride’s anticaries effectiveness is unclear. This 2 -week home-use in situ remineralisation clinical study showed both these factors can influence fluoride bioactivity, and so can potentially affect fluoride’s ability to protect against caries...|$|R
