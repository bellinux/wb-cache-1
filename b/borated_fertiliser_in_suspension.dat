40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} a series of local field and {{glasshouse}} studies to highlight the main issues associated with fertilisers causing germination damage to seed. When <b>fertiliser</b> was placed <b>in</b> close contact with seed either through a conventional drill or when placed on top of seed in the glasshouse, in general small seed was more predisposed to germination damage than large seeds. The greatest risk was when using clover and Brassica seeds. Urea and <b>borated</b> <b>fertilisers</b> cause the most damage, while high analysis DAP and MAP based <b>fertilisers,</b> <b>in</b> particular those containing more ammonium N caused more damage than Superphosphate based treatments. Damage increased with increasing fertiliser rate. Where yield was measured plants usually had the ability to compensate for 15 - 30 % damage, particularly those crops that respond to N. Soil moisture status had a large influence on germination risk, in moist soils damage was much less than in dry soils. When soils were wet after a prolonged dry period, some delayed germination occurred but this was less than if moisture was adequate from the start. Broadcasting <b>fertiliser</b> <b>in</b> contact with seed caused minimal germination damage provided contact time was kept to a minimum. Some recommendations are given. Additional key words: germination damage, fertiliser damage, osmotic pressure, sal...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to bring {{together}} all the information collected {{in the course of}} this research project and to present a synoptic view of <b>fertiliser</b> use <b>in</b> Southland as a guide to the future. The analysis is concerned with all forms of mineral <b>fertiliser</b> used <b>in</b> New Zealand pastoral farming and concentrates on the most important chemical fertiliser used - superphosphate. After reviewing the pattern of agricultural production in the province of Southland, the report considers livestock number trends, new developments in farming likely to affect livestock number trends, the use of <b>fertiliser</b> <b>in</b> pastoral farming, the production of <b>fertiliser</b> <b>in</b> Southland and fluctuations in the demand for fertiliser by farmers...|$|R

40|$|Chemical {{fertilisers}} are {{key element}} of modern technology and have {{played an important role}} in agricultural productivity growth in India. However, the demand-supply gap of <b>fertilisers</b> <b>in</b> India has increased in recent times, thereby leading to increased dependency on imports. Indian imports, which were about 2 million tonnes in early part of 2000, increased to 10. 2 million tonnes of <b>fertilisers</b> <b>in</b> 2008 - 09. In view of importance of <b>fertilisers</b> <b>in</b> agricultural growth and the possibility of an emerging demand-supply gap, there is need to forecast future demand. The paper begins with an overview of fertiliser consumption trends and then identifies important determinants of fertiliser demand and develops projects demand scenarios for <b>fertilisers</b> <b>in</b> India in 2020 - 21. India is the second largest consumer of <b>fertilisers</b> <b>in</b> the world after China, consuming about 26. 5 million tonnes. However, average intensity of <b>fertiliser</b> use <b>in</b> India remains much lower than most countries in the world but is highly skewed, with wide inter-regional, inter-state, and inter-district variations. The results show that non-price factors such as irrigation, high yielding varieties, were more important than price factors in influencing demand for fertilisers. Of the two price policy instruments, affordable fertiliser prices and higher agricultural commodity prices, the former is more powerful <b>in</b> influencing <b>fertiliser</b> demand. The paper suggests that in order to ensure self-sufficiency in agricultural production in the country, availability of fertilisers at affordable prices should be prioritized over higher output prices. By 2020, <b>fertiliser</b> demand <b>in</b> the country is projected to increase to about 41. 6 million tones and is expected to grow at a faster rate in eastern and southern region compared with north and west. To meet the increasing fertiliser requirements of the country, a conducive and stable policy environment, availability of raw materials, capital resources, and price incentives will play a critical role. ...|$|R

40|$|The grain yield {{benefits}} of applying micronutrient fluid fertilisers over conventional granular products in calcareous sandy loam soils have been agronomically demonstrated. An {{understanding of the}} fundamental mechanisms and reactions occurring following application of these products to soils is critical to improve fertiliser management. We therefore examined the diffusion, solubility, and potential availability of manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) from both granular and fluid forms of Mn and Zn <b>fertiliser</b> <b>in</b> an alkaline calcareous and alkaline non-calcareous soil using laboratory incubation experiments in conjunction with an isotopic dilution technique with ⁵⁴Mn and ⁶⁵Zn. Enhanced mobility, solubility, and/or potential availability of Mn and Zn from fluid <b>fertilisers</b> were observed <b>in</b> comparison to Mn or Zn from granular <b>fertilisers</b> <b>in</b> both soils after 5 weeks of incubation. Differential behaviour of fluid and granular fertilisers for Mn and Zn appeared to be independent of their effects on soil pH. Most (~ 90 %) of the Mn <b>in</b> granular <b>fertiliser</b> dissolved and diffused out of the granule but was retained within 4 mm of the point of granular placement, whereas most (~ 85 %) of the Zn in the granular Zn <b>fertiliser</b> source remained <b>in</b> the granule. Our {{data suggest that the}} superior agronomic effectiveness of fluid Mn and Zn <b>fertilisers</b> observed <b>in</b> calcareous soils under field conditions may have resulted from the enhanced diffusion (Mn) and/or solubility/availability (Mn, Zn) of these micronutrients in soil when applied in fluid form.
