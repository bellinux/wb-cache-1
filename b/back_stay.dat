5000|$|The major {{advantage}} a masthead sloop {{has over}} a fractional one, {{is that the}} jib is larger. Since the jib has no mast {{in front of it}} to cause turbulent airflow over it, it is considered much more efficient than the main, especially for sailing up wind. Also, since the fore stay is attached {{to the top of the}} mast, it pulls directly against the <b>back</b> <b>stay.</b> Tightening the <b>back</b> <b>stay,</b> then, increases the tension on the fore stay. This is useful because the jib needs considerable fore stay tension to set well. This need increases in direct proportion to the wind speed and jib size. Increasing the tension on the <b>back</b> <b>stay</b> does not tend to bend the mast, as it would on a fractional sloop. It puts the mast in compression instead. For this reason the mast on a mast head rig has a thicker section at the top to stand this load.|$|E
5000|$|The Seri Wawasan Bridge is a {{longitudinally}} asymmetric cable‐stayed box-girder {{bridge with}} a inverted-Y shape concrete/steel pylon 96m high. The main span, 165m long, {{is supported by}} 30 pairs of forward stay cables, anchored on the 75° forward‐inclined pylon and on the outer edges of the bridge deck, arranged in a fan shape pattern from the side elevation. To counter balance these front stays, a combination of 21 pairs of cable backstays and structural steel tie back was used. The <b>back</b> <b>stay</b> anchored at the (next-) highest point of the pylon is anchored at the curved backstay anchorage point (next-) nearest to the pylon, creating a crisscross‐over pattern from the side elevation, which adds to the aesthetic of the bridge. The overall complexity of the <b>back</b> <b>stay</b> tie back structure, however, may be aesthetically distracting. [...] The inclined concrete pylon and the backstays are anchored into bore piled foundation off the roadway in precinct 8.|$|E

50|$|The {{design of}} the bridges is complex. Each of the two decks is {{supported}} by inclined outward-leaning pylons. The decks are suspended from fans of slender steel rods called deck stays—there are 180 on each deck, made up of over 4 km of cable—and are held in position by other rods called <b>back</b> <b>stays.</b> Because the pylons lean the <b>back</b> <b>stays</b> are under tension. The deck is secured in place by steel collars fitted around (although not supported by) the pillars of the railway bridge; the collars are themselves attached to the bridge's foundations by tie-down rods. The entire structure is thus {{held in place by}} exploiting the tensions between the pylons and the various stay rods and struts.|$|R

I will pay you whatever you want." [...] Ramanna was shocked and scared by the Iraqi proposal. He reportedly could not sleep that night, worried that he might never see his homeland again. He took the next flight out.|$|E
