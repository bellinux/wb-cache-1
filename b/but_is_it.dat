The scientific evidence clearly indicates {{that this is not the}} case... measurements of atmospheric temperatures made by instruments lofted in satellites and balloons show that no warming has occurred in the atmosphere in the last 50 years. This is just the period in which humanmade carbon dioxide has been pouring into the atmosphere and according to the climate studies, the resultant atmospheric warming should be clearly evident.|$|E

500|$|In August 1992, {{the group}} self-funded a seventrack self-titled {{extended}} play, {{also known as}} the Blue EP, on their own Finger label and distributed by MDS. It was produced by Leroy Bath and Ian Taylor, and recorded at Broken Toys Studios, Brisbane. The EP has an early version of [...] "Save Your Skin", co-written by Coghill, Collins, Haug, Middleton and Fanning; it was later expanded and released in July 1994 as a single from their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears. Their second EP, Transfusion, was issued in September 1993, distributed by Polydor Records. At that time, Simon McKenzie of Time Off noted they were [...] "hoping the major label will put a bit of weight behind the disc, but it's not as though they've signed a record deal or anything". McKenzie felt the EP showed they were [...] "wanting to get heavier and louder for a long time, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> also a reaction against the sixties tags they've been stuck with?". The five tracks include [...] "Reap What You Sow", which reached the No.1 spot on the ARIA Alternative Singles Chart, replacing Nirvana's [...] "Heart-Shaped Box". The group recorded their first music video, for [...] "Reap What You Sow"; it was directed by David Barker, who subsequently directed their next seven videos. After the EP's success the group were signed by Polydor.|$|E

Also, during the broadcast itself, Clarkson was seen referring to the controversy that had risen after the Burma Special; when inspecting a bridge, which {{he and his colleagues}} had built during the episode, he was quoted as saying [...] "That is a proud moment, Hammond, <b>but...</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> straight?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Robert Todd Carroll also {{states that}} a more likely source of the {{knowledge}} of the Sirius star system is from contemporary, terrestrial sources who provided information to interested members of the tribes. James Oberg, however, citing these suspicions notes their completely speculative nature, writing that, [...] "The obviously advanced astronomical knowledge must have come from somewhere, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> an ancient bequest or a modern graft? Although Temple fails to prove its antiquity, the evidence for the recent acquisition of the information is still entirely circumstantial." [...] Additionally, James Clifford notes that Griaule sought informants best qualified to speak of traditional lore, and deeply mistrusted converts to Christianity, Islam, or people with too much contact with whites.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{projections}} {{suggest that}} by 2030 almost all energy {{could come from}} non-dispatchable sources – how much wind or solar power is available depends on the weather conditions, and instead of turning on and off available sources becomes one of either storing or transmission of those sources to when {{they can be used}} or to where they can be used. Some excess available energy can be diverted to hydrogen production for use in ships and airplanes, a relatively long term energy storage, in a world where almost all of our energy comes from wind, water, and solar (WWS). Hydrogen is not an energy source, but is a storage medium. A cost analysis will need to be made between long distance transmission and excess capacity. The sun is always shining somewhere, and the wind is always blowing somewhere on the Earth, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> cost effective to bring solar power from Australia to New York? ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} R.E.M.'s previous two records, the music of Monster consisted of distorted guitar tones, minimal overdubs, and touches of 1970s glam rock. Peter Buck described Monster as [...] "a 'rock' record, with the rock in quotation marks." [...] He explained, [...] "That's not what we started out to make, but that's certainly how it turned out to be. There's a nudge, nudge, wink, wink feel to the whole record. Like, it's a rock record, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> really?" [...] Mike Mills told Time, [...] "On past albums we had been exploring acoustic instruments, trying to use the piano and mandolin, and we did it about all we wanted to do it. And you come back to the fact that playing loud electric-guitar music is about as fun as music can be." [...] Stipe's vocals were pushed back in the mix. Buck's guitar work on the album was inspired by the tremolo-heavy guitar playing of Glen Johansson from Echobelly, who supported R.E.M. for some of the Monster Tour.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{limited number}} of appearances, the {{character}} of Darius has an important moral influence in the show. Horvath remarks, [...] "When he joined the show {{it was the first}} time that someone started talking about peace." [...] She explains, [...] "The arrival of Darius, aside from bringing in a great character, represented the first time that someone questioned the basic premise of the show. The basic premise is that 's a hero and he goes around kicking the ass of the bad guys. Now you have this character in Darius who shows up and says, 'Yes, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> actually a good goal to kick the ass of the bad guys?' Even though Mac has to be a good guy who has to fight the bad guys, you set up this scenario where one of his closest friends has questioned whether beating up bad guys makes you a good guy or whether you should be a man of peace. (...) That underlying question shaped the whole rest of the series." [...] Abramowitz says further, [...] "It was a major moment for MacLeod. And {{it was the first time}} for him when he believed that the way of the warrior may not be the only way." [...] Abramowitz summarizes, [...] "Darius was the voice of God on the show, and then God died." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maurice Percy Ashley in The Times Literary Supplement gave a {{positive}} review {{to the book}} in the issue of 9 March 1940: [...] "In recent years the detective story-reading public has been so profusely drenched with thrills, 'wisecracks' and perverted psychology that one sometimes wonders whether there is still room for the old-fashioned straight-forward problem in detection. There are, however, a few first-class exponents of this art with us– though now that Miss Sayers has, for the moment at any rate, turned moralist and others have entered the easier field of thriller writing {{there seem to be}} increasingly few. Mrs. Christie in particular remains true to the old faith; and it is pleasant to be able to record that her hand has not lost its cunning". The reviewer regretted that Poirot had lost some of his 'foibles' and Hastings no longer featured in the plots but he ended on a high note: [...] "Like all Mrs Christie's work, it is economically written, the clues are placed before the reader with impeccable fairness, the red herrings are deftly laid and the solution will cause many readers to kick themselves. Some occasional readers of detective stories are wont to criticize Mrs Christie on the ground that her stories are insufficiently embroidered, that she includes, for instance, no epigrams over the college port. <b>But</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> not time to state that in the realm of detective fiction proper, where problems are fairly posed and fairly solved, there is no one to touch her?" ...|$|E
