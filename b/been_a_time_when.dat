25|$|The {{argument}} from necessary being asserts that all beings are contingent, {{meaning that it}} is possible for them not to exist. Aquinas argued that if everything can possibly not exist, there must have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> nothing existed; as things exist now, there must exist a being with necessary existence, regarded as God.|$|E
25|$|Cuvier speculated {{correctly}} {{that there}} had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> reptiles rather than mammals had been the dominant fauna. This speculation was confirmed over the two decades following his death {{by a series of}} spectacular finds, mostly by English geologists and fossil collectors such as Mary Anning, William Conybeare, William Buckland, and Gideon Mantell, who found and described the first ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and dinosaurs.|$|E
25|$|The helmet {{was buried}} among other regalia and {{instruments}} of power {{as part of}} a furnished ship burial, probably dating from the early 7th century. Although the man in the grave has not been identified, the contents of the grave point to its being that of a king. It is generally thought most likely that Rædwald, the ruler of the East Angles, is the person buried in the ship, due to the proximity of the royal vill of Rendlesham and as use of the site is believed to have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> he held power in England.|$|E

25|$|In any case, Hildegard and Jutta were {{enclosed}} {{together at}} the Disibodenberg, and formed {{the core of a}} growing community of women attached to the male monastery. Jutta was also a visionary and thus attracted many followers who came to visit her at the cloister. Hildegard tells us that Jutta taught her to read and write, but that she was unlearned and therefore incapable of teaching Hildegard sound biblical interpretation. The written record of the Life of Jutta indicates that Hildegard probably assisted her in reciting the psalms, working in the garden and other handiwork, and tending to the sick. This might have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> Hildegard learned how to play the ten-stringed psaltery. Volmar, a frequent visitor, may have taught Hildegard simple psalm notation. The time she studied music could have been the beginning of the compositions she would later create.|$|E
