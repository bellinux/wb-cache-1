25|$|A {{flush toilet}} is {{different}} from a urinal, {{which is designed to}} handle only liquid waste; or from a <b>bidet,</b> which can be used for personal cleansing after toilet use.|$|E
5000|$|Such {{attachable}} <b>bidets</b> (also called [...] "electronic bidets", [...] "electric bidets", [...] "combined toilets", [...] "bidet attachments", or [...] "add-on bidets") {{are controlled}} either mechanically or electronically. Mechanically controlled <b>bidets</b> {{tend to be}} simple mechanisms manually controlled by a valve. There are add on <b>bidets,</b> mechanically controlled, that produce oblique water jet and others vertical jets.The first ones have their flash tubes fixed at the back toilet rim, while the second ones at the side rim. From the last ones some have the apparatus fixed on bowl rim and others on bowl lid. The attachable <b>bidets</b> may be manufactured of plastic, chrome-plated metal, or stainless steel to accommodate many tastes and budgets.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, it is {{used for}} example in Finland, while <b>bidets</b> are more common {{bathroom}} fixtures in many southern European countries. It is very common in Brazil, where traditional <b>bidets</b> are being replaced by it. It is most common in Muslim countries and {{all parts of the}} Arab world.|$|R
5000|$|Electronic <b>bidets</b> {{have been}} {{featured}} in the Simpsons and Futurama as [...] "Japanese Toilets".|$|R
25|$|The seat-heating {{feature is}} very common, found even on toilets that lack the <b>bidet</b> features. As most Japanese homes lack central heating – instead using space heating – the {{bathroom}} {{may be only}} a few degrees above freezing in the winter.|$|E
25|$|The {{most basic}} {{feature is the}} {{integrated}} <b>bidet,</b> a nozzle {{the size of a}} pencil that comes out from underneath the toilet seat and squirts water. It has two settings: one for washing the anus and one for the <b>bidet.</b> The former is called posterior wash, general use, or family cleaning, and the latter is known as feminine cleaning, feminine wash or simply <b>bidet.</b> At no point does the nozzle actually touch the body of the user. The nozzle is also self-cleaning and cleans itself before and after operation. The user can select to wash the anus or vulva by pressing the corresponding button on the control panel. Usually the same nozzle is used for both operations, but at a different position of the nozzle head, and using different openings in the nozzle to squirt water at a different angle to aim for the correct spot. Occasionally, two nozzles are used, each dedicated for one area. The control logic is also attached to a pressure switch or a proximity sensor in the toilet seat, and operates only when the seat is occupied. The very first models did not include this automatic switch-off. A number of curious users pressed the button while watching the toilet to see its mode of operation, and promptly received a jet of warm water in their faces.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, {{the sale}} of Western-style toilets {{exceeded}} {{the sale of}} traditional squat toilets in Japan. Based on toilets with a built-in <b>bidet</b> from Switzerland and the US, the world's largest sanitary equipment company, TOTO, introduced the Washlet in 1980. Japanese companies currently produce {{some of the most}} advanced, high-tech toilets in the world.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, toilet-integrated <b>bidets</b> with drying {{facility}} {{are becoming}} more widespread for use among people with physical disabilities.|$|R
5000|$|Most modern {{electronic}} <b>bidets</b> include customization {{options to}} match the user preferences. Such options include adjustable water, air and seat temperature, adjustable water pressure, adjustable nozzle direction.|$|R

25|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons for low sales outside Japan. One main reason is that it takes some time for the {{customers}} {{to get used to the}} idea of a washlet. Sales in Japan were also slow when the device was introduced in 1980, but after some acclimatization, sales improved significantly starting in 1985. Around 1990, 10% of Japanese households had a washlet, and this number increased greatly to over 50% in 2002. Toto expects a corresponding improvement in foreign sales within the next few years. Another reason is the lack of a power supply near the toilet. While virtually all Japanese washrooms have an electric outlet behind the toilet, many foreign bathrooms do not have a nearby outlet. In Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the UK, and many other countries, high current electrical outlets installed in close proximity to water, or where persons may be wet, are prohibited by legally enforced codes due to health and safety reasons. Finally the outlet of the toilet (for S-type toilets) is max. 10 ~ 15cm from back wall but Japanese toilets need it to be at least 30cm so a S-type European toilet cannot be replaced easily with a Japanese toilet. They are also much more expensive than traditional Western toilets. Finally, in Europe, there is the competition of the traditional Western bidet; conversely, North Americans are not accustomed to any sort of <b>bidet.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{ancestors of}} the Breton were a population of horses that lived in the Breton mountains, possibly descended from steppe horses ridden by Celts. During the Crusades, these mountain horses were crossed with oriental horses to create a type known as the <b>Bidet</b> Breton. In the Middle Ages, the ancestral Breton horse was sought by military leaders, partly because of its comfortable gait, which {{was said to be}} partway between a brisk trot and an amble. [...] Due to its gaits {{and the fact that it}} only stood about [...] high, it was nicknamed the <b>Bidet</b> d'Allure or <b>Bidet</b> Breton. [...] Horses of other bloodlines brought back to Europe during the Crusades had a strong influence on the Breton, and two types subsequently developed. [...] The Sommier was the common, heavier type, used mainly as a pack horse and for farm and draft work. From the Sommier, the Roussin was developed, was used mainly in wars and on long journeys. The Roussins natural ambling gait made it popular as a lighter riding horse.|$|E
500|$|Jackson was {{promoted}} to flight lieutenant on 1July 1941. By now his younger brother Ed had been posted to No.3 Squadron and was serving with him in Palestine. With the campaign in Syria concluding in mid-July, the unit undertook no operations in August and personnel went on leave before returning to action in Egypt the next month. The rural-bred Jackson took to the night life in Alexandria, but his stay at a first-class hotel left him bewildered as {{to the purpose of}} the room's <b>bidet,</b> which he eventually determined was [...] "some feminine arrangement". Peter Ewer, in Storm Over Kokoda, observed: [...] "There was something of the patrician about John Jackson, but his well-to-do background had a distinctly Australian tinge to it. He liked a game of cards, with a bet on the outcome." [...] In Whispering Death, Mark Johnston noted that although [...] "tall and blue-eyed", he [...] "did not have the air of a 'boy's own' or movie star pilot", but rather was [...] "balding, ambling and no extrovert". Jackson returned to Australia in November 1941. He was mentioned in despatches, and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for his [...] "marked keenness and determination" [...] during operations with No.3 Squadron in the Middle East. The former award was promulgated in the London Gazette on 1January 1942 and the latter, which listed him as [...] "John Henry Jackson", on 7April. The DFC was presented to Jackson's widow Elisabeth, after his death.|$|E

50|$|This {{exemption}} {{that would}} allow fire hydrants to continue under current previous lead guidelines {{is similar to the}} one already provided for shower valves. Toilets and <b>bidets</b> are already exempt as well.|$|R
50|$|From an {{environmental}} standpoint, {{some argue that}} <b>bidets</b> can {{reduce the need for}} toilet paper, saving households money on paper products and allowing users to reduce their carbon footprint by reducing their paper waste over time. On the other hand, they increase the amount of heated water used in the bathroom, and, when combined with a toilet, the added complexity increases their total cost of ownership, perhaps causing them to be replaced or upgraded more frequently than simpler toilets. Until further experimentation is done on internal and external losses, the environmental advantages of <b>bidets</b> remain unclear.|$|R
2500|$|In the Western world, {{the most}} common method of {{cleaning}} the anal area after defecation is by toilet paper or sometimes by using a <b>bidet.</b> In many Muslim countries, the faciliites are designed to enable people to follow Islamic toilet etiquette [...] For example, a <b>bidet</b> shower may be plumbed in. The left hand is used for cleansing, for which reason that hand is considered impolite or polluted in many Asian countries.|$|E
2500|$|Toilets in Japan are {{generally}} more elaborate than toilets in other developed nations. There are two styles of toilets commonly found in Japan; the oldest type is a simple squat toilet, which is still common in public conveniences. After World War II, modern Western-type flush toilets and urinals became common. The {{current state of the}} art for Western-style toilets is the <b>bidet</b> toilet, which, as of March 2016, is installed in 81.2% of Japanese households. [...] In Japan, these bidets are commonly called washlets, a brand name of Toto Ltd., and include many advanced features rarely seen outside of Asia. The feature set commonly found on washlets are anus washing, <b>bidet</b> washing, seat warming, and deodorization. Japanese toilets are well-known in popular culture and often parodied in amusing ways in comedic works set in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|In Japan, being clean is very important, {{and some}} Japanese words for 'clean' {{can be used}} to {{describe}} beauty. The word kirei (きれい, 綺麗) can be defined as [...] "pretty, beautiful; clean; pure; orderly." [...] This may explain the success of the high-tech toilet with a built-in <b>bidet.</b> There is also a large market for deodorants and air fresheners that add a pleasant scent to the area.|$|E
5000|$|In Japan, flat sticks {{were used}} in ancient times, being {{replaced}} by toilet paper as the country became more Westernized. Toilets in Japan may include built-in <b>bidets</b> for anal cleansing with warm water.|$|R
50|$|Seating in cars 1, 2 and 4 are {{arranged}} 2+2 transverse, {{with a seat}} pitch of 1,050 mm. Car 3 is a deluxe car and features rotating and reclining seats arranged 2+1 transverse with AC outlets built into the armrest and tables which fold out. Cars 2 and 3 come with heated toilets and are equipped with automatic <b>bidets.</b>|$|R
50|$|They {{are usually}} not meant to replace the use of toilet paper as they are used after some paper to achieve full {{cleanliness}} without immediately having to take a shower. <b>Bidets</b> with a vertical jet are intended to replace the use of toilet paper, as they can achieve {{a high level of}} cleanliness of the anal area.|$|R
2500|$|Since {{the goal}} of the {{preparation}} is to clear the colon of solid matter, the patient should plan to spend the day at home in comfortable surroundings with ready access to toilet facilities.

[...] A soothing salve such as petroleum jelly applied after cleaning the anus will improve patient comfort.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Cuban {{invested}} in Brondell Inc., a San Francisco startup making a high-tech toilet seat called a Swash that {{works like a}} <b>bidet</b> but mounts on a standard toilet. [...] "People tend to approach technology the same way, whether it's in front of them, or behind them," [...] Cuban joked. He also {{invested in}} Goowy Media Inc., a San Diego internet software startup. In April 2006, Sirius Satellite Radio announced that Cuban would host his own weekly radio talk show, Mark Cuban's Radio Maverick. However, the show has not materialized.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second floor}} is reached {{by means of}} an {{elliptical}} stairway in the cross-hall. Embedded into the newel post {{at the base of the}} stairs is glass [...] "peace stone", symbolizing the owners [...] "peace of mind" [...] after having paid off the mortgage. The living quarters for the inhabitants of Wheatland were located on the second floor. A bathroom, complete with bathtub, shower and a <b>bidet,</b> was installed in the west wing when the Willsons bought Wheatland in 1884. The third floor was primarily used as servants' quarters and has been left unrestored.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bidets</b> {{were first}} {{identified}} in the 15th century. They were used as [...] "jack-of-all-trades" [...] animals, equally suited for riding, farm work and passenger transport. They declined during the 19th century, when railways and better-kept roads pressured horse breeders into specialising their breeds. Despite the animal's disappearance, the name [...] "bidet" [...] survives in several French cultural references.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bidets</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly popular with the ageing community, or for use among people with physical disabilities. These combined units make independent toileting possible for many people, affording greater independence. These are often special units with higher toilet seats allowing easier wheelchair transfer, and with some form of electronic remote control that benefits an individual with limited mobility or requiring assistance.|$|R
50|$|The museum's {{exhibits}} {{bring out}} {{the development of the}} toilet related technology of the entire gamut of human history, social habits, etiquettes specific to existing sanitary situation and the legal framework in different periods. The items on display not only include privies, chamber pots, decorated Victorian toilet seats, toilet furniture, <b>bidets</b> and water closets in vogue since from 1145 AD to-date. Display boards have poetry related to toilet and its use.|$|R
2500|$|Both the {{traditional}} squat toilet and the high-tech toilet {{are a source}} of confusion for foreigners unaccustomed to these devices. There are humorous reports of individuals using a toilet, and randomly pressing buttons on the control panel either out of curiosity or in search for the flushing control, and suddenly to their horror receiving a jet of water directed at the genitals or anus. As the water jet continues for a few seconds after he jumps up, he also gets himself or the bathroom wet. Many Japanese toilets now feature pressure sensitive seats that automatically shut off the <b>bidet</b> when the person gets up. Many also have the buttons written in English to reduce the culture shock.|$|E
2500|$|The modern toilet in Japan, in English {{sometimes}} called Super Toilet, and commonly known in Japanese as [...] or as [...] {{is one of}} the most advanced types of toilet worldwide, showing a dazzling array of features. The Toto product Washlet Zoe is listed in Guinness World Records as the world's most sophisticated toilet with seven functions. However, as the model was introduced in 1997, it is now likely to be inferior to the latest model by Toto, Neorest. The idea for the washlet came from abroad, and the first toilet seat with integrated <b>bidet</b> was produced in the United States in 1964. The age of the high-tech toilet in Japan started in 1980 with the introduction of the Washlet G Series by Toto, and since then the product name washlet has been used to refer to all types of Japanese high-tech toilets. As of 2002, almost half of all private homes in Japan have such a toilet, exceeding the number of households with a personal computer. While the toilet looks like a Western-style toilet at first glance, there are numerous additional features—such as blow dryer, seat heating, massage options, water jet adjustments, automatic lid opening, automatic flushing, wireless control panel, room heating and air conditioning for the room—included either as part of the toilet or in the seat. [...] These features can be accessed by an (often wireless) control panel attached to the seat or mounted on a nearby wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ce Smiley avait une jument que les gars appelaient le <b>bidet</b> du quart d'heure, mais seulement pour plaisanter, vous comprenez, parce que, bien entendu, elle était plus vite que ca! Et il avait coutume de gagner de l'argent avec cette bête, quoi-qu'elle fût poussive, cornarde, toujours prise d'asthme, de coliques ou de consomption, ou de {{quelque chose}} d'approchant. On lui donnait 2 ou 300 'yards' au départ, puis on la dépassait sans peine; mais jamais à la fin elle ne manquait de s'échauffer, de s'exaspérer et elle arrivait, s'écartant, se défendant, ses jambes grêles en l'air devant les obstacles, quelquefois les évitant et faisant avec cela plus de poussière qu'aucun cheval, plus de bruit surtout avec ses éternumens et reniflemens.---crac! elle arrivait donc toujours première d'une tête, aussi juste qu'on peut le mesurer. Et il avait un petit bouledogue qui, à le voir, ne valait pas un sou; on aurait cru que parier contre lui c'était voler, tant il était ordinaire; mais aussitôt les enjeux faits, il devenait un autre chien. Sa mâchoire inférieure commencait à ressortir comme un {{gaillard}} d'avant, ses dents se découvcraient brillantes commes des fournaises, et un chien pouvait le taquiner, l'exciter, le mordre, le jeter deux ou trois fois par-dessus son épaule, André Jackson, c'était le nom du chien, André Jackson prenait cela tranquillement, comme s'il ne se fût jamais attendu à autre chose, et quand les paris étaient doublés et redoublés contre lui, il vous saisissait l'autre chien juste à l'articulation de la jambe de derrière, et il ne la lâchait plus, non pas qu'il la mâchât, vous concevez, mais il s'y serait tenu pendu jusqu'à ce qu'on jetât l'éponge en l'air, fallût-il attendre un an. Smiley gagnait toujours avec cette bête-là; malheureusement ils ont fini par dresser un chien qui n'avait pas de pattes de derrière, parce qu'on les avait sciées, et quand les choses furent au point qu'il voulait, et qu'il en vint à se jeter sur son morceau favori, le pauvre chien comprit en un instant qu'on s'était moqué de lui, et que l'autre le tenait. Vous n'avez jamais vu personne avoir l'air plus penaud et plus découragé; il ne fit aucun effort pour gagner le combat et fut rudement secoué, de sorte que, regardant Smiley comme pour lui dire:--Mon coeur est brisé, c'est ta faute; pourquoi m'avoir livré à un chien qui n'a pas de pattes de derrière, puisque c'est par là que je les bats?--il s'en alla en clopinant, et se coucha pour mourir. Ah! c'était un bon chien, cet André Jackson, et il se serait fait un nom, s'il avait vécu, car il y avait de l'etoffe en lui, il avait du génie, je la sais, bien que de grandes occasions lui aient manqué; mais il est impossible de supposer qu'un chien capable de se battre comme lui, certaines circonstances étant données, ait manqué de talent. Je me sens triste toutes les fois que je pense à son dernier combat et au dénoûment qu'il a eu. Eh bien! ce Smiley nourrissait des terriers à rats, et des coqs combat, et des chats, et toute sorte de choses, au point qu'il était toujours en mesure de vous tenir tête, et qu'avec sa rage de paris on n'avait plus de repos. Il attrapa un jour une grenouille et l'emporta chez lui, disant qu'il prétendait faire son éducation; vous me croirez si vous voulez, mais pendant trois mois il n'a rien fait que lui apprendre à sauter dans une cour retirée de sa maison. Et je vous réponds qu'il avait reussi. Il lui donnait un petit coup par derrière, et l'instant d'après vous voyiez la grenouille tourner en l'air comme un beignet au-dessus de la poêle, faire une culbute, quelquefois deux, lorsqu'elle était bien partie, et retomber sur ses pattes comme un chat. Il l'avait dressée dans l'art de gober des mouches, er l'y exercait continuellement, si bien qu'une mouche, du plus loin qu'elle apparaissait, était une mouche perdue. Smiley avait coutume de dire que tout ce qui manquait à une grenouille, c'était l'éducation, qu'avec l'éducation elle pouvait faire presque tout, et je le crois. Tenez, je l'ai vu poser Daniel Webster là sur se plancher,--Daniel Webster était le nom de la grenouille,--et lui chanter: Des mouches! Daniel, des mouches!--En un clin d'oeil, Daniel avait bondi et saisi une mouche ici sur le comptoir, puis sauté de nouveau par terre, où il restait vraiment à se gratter la tête avec sa patte de derrière, comme s'il n'avait pas eu la moindre idée de sa superiorité. Jamais vous n'avez grenouille vu de aussi modeste, aussi naturelle, douee comme elle l'était! Et quand il s'agissait de sauter purement et simplement sur terrain plat, elle faisait plus de chemin en un saut qu'aucune bete de son espèce que vous puissiez connaître. Sauter à plat, c'était son fort! Quand il s'agissait de cela, Smiley entassait les enjeux sur elle tant qu'il lui, restait un rouge liard. Il faut le reconnaitre, Smiley était monstrueusement fier de sa grenouille, et il en avait le droit, car des gens qui avaient voyagé, qui avaient tout vu, disaient qu'on lui ferait injure de la comparer à une autre; de facon que Smiley gardait Daniel dans une petite boîte a claire-voie qu'il emportait parfois à la Ville pour quelque pari.|$|E
5000|$|In British English, [...] "commode" [...] is the {{standard}} term for a chair, often on wheels, enclosing a chamber pot—as used in hospitals and the homes of invalids.
