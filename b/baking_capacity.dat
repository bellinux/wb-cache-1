40|$|This study {{presented}} {{the development and}} optimization of operational parameters of an indigenous gas-fired bread-baking oven for small-scale entrepreneur. It is an insulated rectangular box-like chamber, made of galvanized-steel sheets and having a total dimension of 920 mm× 650 mm× 600 mm. This oven consists of two baking compartments and three combustion chambers. The oven characteristics were evaluated {{in terms of the}} <b>baking</b> <b>capacity,</b> baking efficiency and weight loss of the baked bread. The physical properties of the baked breads were measured and analyzed using Duncan multiple range test of one way ANOVA at significant level of p< 0. 05. These properties were optimized to determine the optimum baking temperature using 3 D surface response plot of Statistical Release 7. The <b>baking</b> <b>capacity,</b> baking efficiency, weight loss and optimum baking temperature were: 12. 5 kg/hr, 87. 8 %, 12. 5 g, 200 - 220 oC, respectively. The physical properties of baked bread dough were found to correspond with the imported product (control sample). These results showed that, the developed gas-fired baking oven can be adopted for baking of bread at domestic and commercial levels...|$|E

The cooker has a cooking surface of 1.7 square meters, two large ovens for <b>baking,</b> and storage <b>capacity</b> for heating 800 litres of water at any given time. Each oven {{is large enough to}} bake up to 10 loaves of bread at one time, or roast an entire goat.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{the effect}} of lactic acid and UV {{irradiation}} on the physicochemical and structural characteristics of cassava and corn starches was evaluated. Only the modified cassava starch presented <b>baking</b> expansion <b>capacity.</b> From RVA, reduction of viscosity values, greater internal stability and none set back for modified cassava starch were observed. Modified corn starch did not show any peak viscosity. There {{were no significant differences}} in DSC thermal properties of treated and native starches. Amylopectin and amylose molecules from both the modified starches displayed some degradation. Molecular weight of cassava amylopectin was mostly preserved, whereas corn amylopectin was evenly attacked through the granule. Nevertheless, the B long branched chains of cassava amylopectin, with DP~ 37, were degraded whereas they were unchanged for corn amylopectin. Key words: starch, photochemical treatment, expansion capacity, structural and physicochemical characteristic...|$|R
40|$|Polyphenolic components, such as anthraquinones and stilbenes, from {{species of}} the genus Rheum {{have been shown to}} have a range of bioactivities {{relevant}} to human health. This paper outlines the polyphenolic composition of edible petioles of garden rhubarb (Rheum rhapontigen) and describes the effects of common cooking methods on total polyphenolic content, anthocyanin content and total antioxidant capacity. Most cooking regimes (fast stewing, slow stewing and baking) except blanching increased total polyphenol content and overall antioxidant capacity, compared to the raw material. The patterns of anthocyanin content and total polyphenol content between the different cooking regimes suggested a balance between two processes; cooking facilitated the release of polyphenol compounds from the rhubarb but also caused breakdown of the released compounds. Baking and slow stewing offered the best maintenance of colour through preservation of anthocyanin and the highest antioxidant <b>capacity.</b> <b>Baking</b> for 20 min provided well-cooked rhubarb with the highest antioxidant capacity and the highest anthocyanin content, which is important for the aesthetic quality of the dish. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometric (LC–MS) analysis putatively identified over 40 polyphenol components in raw rhubarb, including anthraquinone, stilbene, anthocyanin and flavonol derivatives. Baking caused selective effects on the stability of the different polyphenol components. Initially, the yield of all components increased but there was a drastic decline in the relative stability of anthraquinone aglycones with increasing cooking time and initial evidence for the turnover of other anthraquinone derivatives was obtained...|$|R
