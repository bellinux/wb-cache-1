[...] Such an act of repudiation is designed to signal to centrist voters that the politician is not <b>beholden</b> <b>to</b> <b>traditional,</b> and sometimes unpopular, interest groups associated with the party, although such a repudiation runs the risk of alienating some of the politician's allies and the party's base voters. The term is named after the hip hop artist Sister Souljah.|$|R

40|$|A {{new measure}} of {{adherence}} <b>to</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>values</b> was created {{with the objective}} of facilitating research within and across cultures and nations. The measure was tested in China (N = 321) and Russia (N = 314) and factor analysis of the data revealed two subscales named Personal <b>Traditional</b> <b>Values</b> (10 items) and Public <b>Traditional</b> <b>Values</b> (6 items). Empirical psychometric testing of the overall 16 -item measure and the two subscales strongly supported the validity and reliability of all three measures. Means comparisons conducted to assess how well the measures could be used for cross-cultural comparisons revealed the Russians somewhat more than the Chinese living by <b>traditional</b> <b>values</b> overall, both nations about equal on living according <b>to</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>values</b> in their personal lives, and the Russians significantly more inclined <b>to</b> abide by <b>traditional</b> <b>values</b> in public. Also tested were several social and psychological variables as theoretical predictors of living by <b>traditional</b> <b>values,</b> and Life Satisfaction was tested as a possible correlate of living according <b>to</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>values.</b> Regression analyses on the combined data confirmed that Family Emotional Support, Conscientiousness, Collectivism, and Age were all significant positive predictors of living by <b>traditional</b> <b>values.</b> Additional regressions also found some unique predictors for each nation. These findings and the results of the parametric tests support the use of the new scales for measuring <b>traditional</b> <b>values</b> both within and across cultures...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploratory}} one, which examines {{the relationship between}} Western influences (such as the media, education, work, travel, and friendships) and <b>traditional</b> <b>values</b> in South Korea (such as those related to family, social relationships, nationalism, social order, leisure time, work, religion and women??s issues). The relationship between these was investigated in light of modernization theories and Riesman??s stages of societal progress. Furthermore, a survey was conducted among 579 individuals from the younger and older generations in Seoul and Daegu, to determine the degree of Western influences among the generations, and the adherence <b>to</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>values.</b> It {{was found that the}} younger generation clearly had more exposure to Western influences, and also adhered much less <b>to</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>values,</b> while the opposite held true for the older generation. A case was made that South Korea??s unprecedented development following Independence opened the country, especially the younger generation, to influences from the West as they had never experienced before. The generation gap that came {{as a result of this}} is extreme, and without express effort <b>to</b> preserve those <b>traditional</b> <b>values</b> that have shaped Korean society for so long, there may be serious ramifications for Korean society in the future...|$|R
