5|$|A population's genetic {{variation}} can <b>be</b> <b>greatly</b> reduced by a bottleneck, and even beneficial adaptations may be permanently eliminated. The loss of variation leaves the surviving population vulnerable to any new selection pressures such as disease, climate change or {{shift in the}} available food source, because adapting in response to environmental changes requires sufficient {{genetic variation}} in the population for natural selection to take place.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the higher Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike receives fewer visitors. When climbing from the west many people traverse the western slopes on their way to Helvellyn. Despite this the summit does still receive a large number of walkers, who use a large number of footpaths. The large number of footpaths causes significant disturbance to the summit vegetation, which could <b>be</b> <b>greatly</b> reduced by using fewer footpaths.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium is a {{rare earth}} element that has a metallic, bright silver luster. It is soft enough to be cut with a knife, and can be {{machined}} without sparking if overheating is avoided.

5|$|Long-term field {{research}} has shown that range size, group size, social systems, and territorial behavior vary widely, and may <b>be</b> <b>greatly</b> affected by food distribution and quality. It is generally agreed that the ruffed lemur social system is multi-male/multi-female with a fission-fusion society, although some populations of black-and-white ruffed lemur have been reported as monogamous. This social flexibility is suspected to improve survivability despite an inflexible feeding ecology.|$|E
5|$|Richard Fetherston had {{established}} a Baby Health Center in Prahran in 1920 that provided post-natal care.

He asked Mary if she {{would be willing to}} establish such a clinic, which would be open one day a week.|$|E
5|$|Seabird {{mortality}} {{caused by}} long-line fisheries can <b>be</b> <b>greatly</b> reduced by {{techniques such as}} setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, {{increasing the amount of}} weight on lines and by using bird scarers, and their deployment is increasingly required by many national fishing fleets. The international ban on the use of drift nets has also helped reduce the mortality of seabirds and other marine wildlife.|$|E

5|$|Despite the UERL's {{success in}} {{financing}} and constructing the Hampstead Railway in only seven years, its opening {{was not the}} financial success that had been expected. In the Hampstead Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 25million passengers, just half of the 50million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to <b>be</b> <b>greatly</b> over-optimistic, as did the improvement in passenger numbers expected on the newly electrified MDR – in each case achieving only around fifty per cent of their targets.|$|E
5|$|Following Oppenheimer's {{reorganization}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory in July 1944, {{the work on the}} uranium gun-type weapon was concentrated in Francis Birch's O-1 (Gun) Group. The concept was pursued so that in case of a failure to develop an implosion bomb, at least the enriched uranium could be used. Henceforth the gun-type had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to <b>be</b> <b>greatly</b> simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted, one short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay. The new design was called Little Boy.|$|E
5|$|Haumea's moons are {{unusual in}} a number of ways. They are thought to be part of its {{extended}} collisional family, which formed billions of years ago from icy debris after a large impact disrupted Haumea's ice mantle. Hiʻiaka, the larger, outermost moon, has large amounts of pure water ice on its surface, which is rare among Kuiper belt objects. Namaka, about one tenth the mass, has an orbit with surprising dynamics: it is unusually eccentric and appears to <b>be</b> <b>greatly</b> influenced by the larger satellite.|$|E

5|$|In New Guinea, {{a country}} without roads, {{large-scale}} transportation {{of men and}} materiel {{would have to be}} accomplished by aircraft or ships. A multi-pronged approach was employed to solve this problem. Disassembled landing craft were shipped to Australia, where they were assembled in Cairns. The range of these small landing craft was to <b>be</b> <b>greatly</b> extended by the landing ships of the VII Amphibious Force, which began arriving in late 1942, and formed part of the newly formed Seventh Fleet. Since the Seventh Fleet had no aircraft carriers, the range of naval operations was limited by that of the fighter aircraft of the Fifth Air Force.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon and the plutonium gun-type fission weapon, the uranium gun-type weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design. The concept was pursued so that {{in case of a}} failure to develop a plutonium bomb, it would still be possible to use the gun principle. The gun-type design henceforth had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to <b>be</b> <b>greatly</b> simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted. The simplified weapon was short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay.|$|E
5|$|In {{some very}} small insects, the venation may <b>be</b> <b>greatly</b> reduced. In Chalcidoidea (Chalcid wasps), for instance, only the subcosta {{and part of}} the radius are present. Conversely, an {{increase}} in venation may occur by the branching of existing veins to produce accessory veins or by the development of additional, intercalary veins between the original ones, as in the wings of Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets). Large numbers of cross-veins are present in some insects, and they may form a reticulum as in the wings of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and {{at the base of the}} forewings of Tettigonioidea and Acridoidea (katydids and grasshoppers respectively).|$|E

5|$|The Thin Man gun-type {{design was}} at that time based on the fissibility of the very pure plutonium-239 isotope so far only {{produced}} in microgram quantities by the Berkeley cyclotron. When the Hanford production reactors came on-line in early 1944, the mix of plutonium-239 and plutonium-240 obtained was found to have a high rate of spontaneous fission. To avoid pre-detonation, the muzzle velocity of the gun-type design would need to <b>be</b> <b>greatly</b> raised, making it impractically long.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} problem that arises at {{the interface between}} wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues {{that make up a}} wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with oxygen and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, {{would not be able to}} provide transportation across the interface. In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to diffuse across the interface, a process that would <b>be</b> <b>greatly</b> limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as keratin, of which hair and nails are composed.|$|E
5|$|Commandant Teste was {{designed}} to accommodate the naval version of the Farman F.60 Goliath torpedo bomber, but they were obsolete when she was commissioned in 1932. Biplane Levasseur PL.14 torpedo bomber floatplanes were only briefly used as they proved to be too fragile for landing at sea. They were replaced by improved Levasseur PL.15 biplanes from July–August 1934. The Latécoère 298 monoplane replaced the PL.15 in March–May 1939. The scouting squadron was initially equipped with fixed-wing Gourdou-Leseurre GL-810 floatplanes until the folding wing Gourdou-Leseurre GL-811 arrived in October 1933. They were replaced in turn by the improved Gourdou-Leseurre GL-813 in early 1936. The larger Loire 130 flying boat replaced the GL-813 from April 1938, although the catapults had to be modified to handle their greater weight. No fighter seaplanes were ever embarked on Commandant Teste, although the Loire 210 floatplane {{was designed}} for the role. However, it proved to <b>be</b> <b>greatly</b> out-classed by contemporary land-based fighters and only 20 were built in 1939.|$|E

5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, so they do not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit system will be changed is that determination of values can often <b>be</b> <b>greatly</b> improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 7 May, Dönitz gave the order for all German {{military}} forces to unconditionally surrender, and on 8 May the German Instrument of Surrender was delivered to General Böhme. The Germans were to withdraw from all Norwegian towns and the Swedish border and gradually redeploy to areas pre-designated for disarmament; simultaneously, all senior Nazi party officials and security personnel were to immediately be arrested. Force 134 would <b>be</b> <b>greatly</b> outnumbered during its task; a total of 30,000 Allied troops would have to supervise the disarmament of more than 350,000 German troops. There were fears that the German forces might refuse to surrender and instead resist the Allied occupation forces, and there were particular concerns about what the large detachment of Kriegsmarine personnel at the port of Trondheim might do.|$|E

The loss of these relics was thought by many Christian Byzantines to be a clear mark of divine displeasure. Some blamed the Jews for this misfortune and {{for the loss of}} Syria in general. There were reports that Jews helped the Persians capture certain cities and that the Jews tried to slaughter Christians in cities that the Persians had already conquered but were found and foiled from doing so.
