50|$|Fahnestock clips {{were seen}} on early radio {{receiver}} <b>breadboard</b> <b>construction,</b> model train power connections, and the like. They were also available on early dry batteries. Today, they {{have largely been}} supplanted by binding posts. However, they remain in use in elementary schools especially, where their ease of use and visible connections make them a popular way for science instructors to teach the creation of simple circuits, and most university physics departments still have them on apparatus.|$|E
5000|$|Prototypes {{which are}} subject to {{modification}} are often not made on PCBs, using instead <b>breadboard</b> <b>construction.</b> Historically this could be literally a breadboard, a wooden board with components attached to it and joined up with wire. More recently the term is applied to a board of thin insulating material with holes at standard 0.1-inch pitch; components are pushed through the holes to anchor them, and point-to-point wired {{on the other side}} of the board. Some prototyping [...] "breadboards" [...] have this layout, but with metal socket strips into which components are pushed; all the terminals in a straight line in one direction are electrically connected. Such breadboards, and stripboards, fall somewhere between PCBs and point-to-point; they do not require design and manufacture of a PCB, and are as easily modified as a point-to-point setup.|$|E
40|$|A timing {{discriminator}} whose {{output is}} relatively insensitive to input pulse width and amplitude is described. The video-handling technique {{is known as}} slope reversal processing {{and is based on}} tapped delay line estimation methods. The concept, design, <b>breadboard</b> <b>construction,</b> and preliminary laboratory test results are reviewed. The processor system features (1) a peak input voltage dynamic range of 80 x starting at 100 microvolts; (2) a four stage preamplifier/line-driver having a voltage gain of 2400 x; (3) a tapped delay-line estimator implemented for slope reversal triggering by differential comparison; (4) a nominal plus or minus 2. 5 nsec shift of the output trigger leading edge over the entire input voltage range, (5) up to 7 dB discrimination against pulse widths less than 35 nsec; and (6) up to one order of magnitude reduction in the false alarm rate compared to a constant fraction system...|$|E
5000|$|A <b>breadboard</b> is a <b>construction</b> {{base for}} {{prototyping}} of electronics. Originally it was literally a bread board, a polished {{piece of wood}} used for slicing bread. In the 1970s the solderless breadboard (AKA plugboard, a terminal array board) became available and nowadays the term [...] "breadboard" [...] is commonly {{used to refer to}} these.|$|R
5000|$|Radial leads project {{more or less}} in {{parallel}} from the same surface or aspect of a component package, rather than from opposite ends of the package. Originally, radial leads were defined as more-or-less following a radius of a cylindrical component (such as a ceramic disk capacitor). [...] Over time, this definition was generalized in contrast to axial leads, and took on its current form. When placed on a board, radial components [...] "stand up" [...] perpendicular, occupying a smaller footprint on sometimes-scarce [...] "board real estate", making them useful in many high-density designs. The parallel leads projecting from a single mounting surface gives radial components an overall [...] "plugin-nature", facilitating their use in high-speed automated component insertion ("board-stuffing") machines.When needed, an axial component can be effectively converted into a radial component, by bending one of its leads into a [...] "U" [...] shape so that it ends up close to and parallel with the other lead. Extra insulation with heat-shrink tubing may be used to prevent shorting out on nearby components. Conversely, a radial component can be pressed into service as an axial component by separating its leads as far as possible, and extending them into an overall length-spanning shape. These improvisations are often seen in <b>breadboard</b> or prototype <b>construction,</b> but are deprecated for mass production designs. This is because of difficulties in use with automated component placement machinery, and poorer reliability because of reduced vibration and mechanical shock resistance in the completed assembly.|$|R
40|$|Medical imaging {{technologies}} are rarely suitable for intraoperative applications in cancer diagnostics, {{given the current}} state of the art in biomedical engineering. Conventional histological procedures are still prevalent, even though they are more elaborate and time-consuming for the staff. The method of autofluorescence spectroscopy is a new attempt in real time cancer classification. This project is a first step on the way to using this position sensitive method in combination with minimally-invasive imaging. A concept was developed to adapt the measurement of the fluorescence spectrum to a traditional video endoscope without compromising the quality of the video image. The quintessential points of this concept were evaluated, and the electronic components, consisting of illuminant, driver circuit, and control system, were developed to a fully functional <b>breadboard</b> <b>construction.</b> In order to record the fluorescence spectrum, the white light needs to be deactivated temporarily. During this time, the area being examined is illuminated with UV light. Apart from linking two light sources, there are connectors to trigger the camera and the spectrometer. The camera is triggered in such a way that the video image remains flicker-free. For the evaluation of a future full prototype, the controller has already been programmed with the implementations of several different concepts for the control signals...|$|E
