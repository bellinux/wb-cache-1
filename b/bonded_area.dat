40|$|The {{integrity}} of steel-aluminium dissimilar alloy joints {{is dependent on}} the thermal cycle applied during the joining process. The thermal field has a direct influence on the growth of the intermetallic compounds (IMC), which result from the reaction between iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al), but it also determines the size of the <b>bonding</b> <b>area</b> of the joint. A finite element (FE) thermal model was developed to predict the transient thermal cycle at the Fe-Al interface for different levels of applied energy by changing the power density and interaction time. The time-temperature profiles were correlated to the weld geometry, IMC layer thickness and mechanical strength. The experimental results showed that having a small <b>bonding</b> <b>area</b> is equally detrimental to the mechanical strength of the joint as having a thick IMC layer. The FE model suggested that comparing to time, the temperature is more important in laser welding of steel to aluminium as this is the factor which most contributes to the growth of the IMC layer and the formation of the <b>bonding</b> <b>area.</b> However, {{it was not possible to}} identify a thermal field able to produce simultaneously a large <b>bonding</b> <b>area</b> and a thin IMC layer to optimize the joint strength...|$|R

30|$|Anodically bonded {{substrates}} {{having a}} large cavity are fabricated for a silicon MEMS device. Anodic bonded substrates with four different bonding areas are simulated {{for the analysis}} of stresses, occurring during the CMP process. In order to prevent anodically bonded substrate fracture, the stress intensity of four samples is analyzed according to the <b>bonded</b> <b>area</b> and pattern of the glass pillar arrays inside the cavity. As the ratio of <b>bonded</b> <b>area</b> to cavity area increased from 7.0 to 21.2 %, the von Mises stress occurring during the CMP process was relieved from 89.5 to 0.3  MPa.

40|$|The role of bonding in the tensile creep {{behavior}} of paper was analyzed. This {{was accomplished by}} producing handsheets at a range of different bonding levels through manipulation of relative <b>bonded</b> <b>area</b> and specific bond strength. This was done by varying the level of wet pressing (to change relative <b>bonded</b> <b>area)</b> and using debonding and bonding agents (to change specific bond strength). Once manufactured, sheets underwent an extensive battery of physical testing and creep testing. Creep testing was conducted under constant humidity and cyclic humidity (accelerated creep) conditions. Microscopic analysis techniques were also employed to visually study <b>bonded</b> <b>area</b> loss from creep strain. Two mathematical models (one empirical and one rheological) were created to isolate, account for, and incorporate bonding into predicting tensile creep behavior in paper. Overall, {{the results from this}} thesis show that the role of bonding in tensile creep behavior (and accelerated creep behavior) is no different than its role in stress-strain behavior, which is a new finding. This means the bonding influence on tensile creep behavior is related to sheet efficiency and how effectively stress is distributed within the structure, <b>bonded</b> <b>area</b> loss is a strain-induced phenomenon and bonding is not the cause of accelerated creep behavior.

30|$|Three {{ultrasound}} arrays {{provided by}} IKTS each consisting of 16 elements, a centre frequency of 5  MHz, an element pitch of 400  μm, an element width of 350  μm and an element length of 8  mm are {{arranged for the}} ultrasonic testing of the three areas of the seam bond as shown in Fig.  1 on the right. This arrangement enables arrays A and B to achieve special resolution of 400  µm when evaluating the adhesive in the x-direction using the pulse echo method. The arrays A and B can inspect an area of 6.5  mm each, whereby the resolution for one test position consists of 14 individual measurements. This is done through a line scan with a 3 element aperture that is shifted by one element after every shot. This test area is sufficient for the complete testing of seam <b>bond</b> <b>area</b> b, whereas seam <b>bond</b> <b>area</b> a is usually larger. This means that this array cannot completely test seam <b>bond</b> <b>area</b> a. Array C can focus the ultrasound in the y-direction to the strong curved edge.

30|$|Thus, this {{discussion}} {{makes clear that}} the scarf joint should perform best for the same <b>bonded</b> <b>area</b> of adhesive, followed by the stepped-lap joint. The DLJ only outperforms the SLJ, which clearly gives the worst performance, {{but it should be}} considered that, for the same LO, the DLJ has twice the <b>bonded</b> <b>area</b> than all other joints. As a result, these differences should result in a distinct joint behaviour, although the joints’ performance also depends on the adhesive type, in the sense that, typically, more brittle adhesives are more sensitive to peak stresses. Moreover, at high transmitted loads, which typically take place for higher LO, another issue has importance: plasticization of the adherends. All these issues will be discussed further in the strength analysis that will follow.|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} of electronic packages under exceptionally harsh environments presents a significant {{challenge for the}} microelectronics industry, for example, in down-hole, well-logging and turbo-machinery applications. High temperature Au based solders are one potential candidate for die attachment for harsh environments and is already used in limited cases. For Au-Si die bonding, some of the Si is provided by diffusion from the Si die itself. Therefore, the interfacial reaction between the Si and Au-Si thin foil solder preform is {{a key factor in}} the control of the die bonding process. Unfortunately, during the die bonding process, defects such as voids, delaminations, and impurities are not unusual. These defects are caused by the assembly process, chemical impurities, soldering reactions, and thermal stresses. Understanding these defects is critical for the reliable performance of the devices after bonding. In this paper, optimization of the Au-Si eutectic die bonding has been performed and near 100 % <b>bonded</b> <b>area</b> confirmed by scanning acoustic microscopy achieved consistently.

30|$|Depending on the substrate, the {{adhesive}} procedure can be extremally challenging. The difficulty to stablish {{a proper}} and durable <b>bonding</b> <b>area</b> in NCCLs {{is related to}} the modified histology of the affected dental structure, that presents hyper-mineralized dentin and denatured collagen, not ideal for the bond stability [22]. There are many studies on adhesive procedures in the cases of NCCLs and the best results are usually obtained with RMGIC and two-step self-etch adhesive systems [20, 21], with some variations among commercial brands. In general, the durable <b>bonding</b> <b>area</b> created by the two-step self-etch adhesives is attributed to a simple operatory technique, as the primer is applied on dry dentin, becoming less dependent on the operator. Additionally, the chemical adhesion to the dental structure, provided by the specific monomers, such as 10 -methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogenphosphate (10 -MDP), is considered crucial [20 – 23].|$|R

40|$|Bond {{strength}} is classically characterized into two separate factors; {{area of the}} bond and specific bond strength. This separation is especially important in pulps that lack strength properties, and are specifically used for their optical properties, such as mechanical pulps. In this research {{the applicability of the}} Ingmansson and Thode method for distinguishing between specific <b>bonded</b> <b>area</b> and specific bond strength in mechanical pulps is studied. It is shown that the rigid, non-collapsable, nature of the mechanical pulp can be overcome by press drying the sheets until they approach their 50 % relative humidity moisture content. Mechanical pulps have been assumed to operate in a domain where fiber failure can be considered insignificant, and the <b>bonded</b> <b>area</b> to tensile strength relationship is linear. In this study it was shown that most commercial pulps operate in a significant fiber failure domain. However, it is shown that pure fines and fines rich mechanical pulp better follow a linear <b>bonded</b> <b>area</b> to tensile strength relationship rather than a non-linear (significant fiber failure) model, suggesting that only the fiber fraction undergoes fiber failure and the finer fractions predominantly bond failure. The Ingmansson and Thode method relies on the use of scattering coefficient as a measure of specific surface area. It is shown that scattering coefficient is an accurate estimate of mechanical pulp specific surface area at a constant wavelength of light, provided that the wavelength used to measure scattering coefficient is above the significant absorption limit.
