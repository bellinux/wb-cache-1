500|$|Following {{their last}} record, the highly {{successful}} Odyssey Number Five, the band {{agreed that they}} wanted to continue in their musical careers, but wanted to have more fun with it. They were no longer dole reliant, as they had been when they made their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears. Drummer Jon Coghill told The Sydney Morning Herald [...] "we wanted to have more fun and enjoy that we were a band, rather than chase what you're supposed to do", and guitarist Ian Haug said [...] "We all found that this is really important to us, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make it more fun".|$|E
500|$|This {{story had}} no {{traces of the}} Circle 7 version of the film, since the filmmakers did not read its script: [...] "Not out of spite, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> start fresh, and not be {{influenced}} by what they'd done," [...] said Unkrich. [...] "We didn't look {{at any of the}} work they'd done. We really didn't want to know anything about it." [...] In February 2007, Lasseter announced Toy Story 2s co-director, Unkrich, as the sole director of the film instead of himself (Lasseter had directed the first two films and was busy directing Cars 2), and Michael Arndt as screenwriter. 2010 was also announced as the tentative release date.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{took place}} at Henson Recording Studios, Conway Recording Studios and Capitol Studios in California, Electric Lady Studios in New York City, and Gang Recording Studio in Paris, France. Having worked with keyboardist and {{arranger}} Chris Caswell on Tron: Legacy, the duo enlisted him and connected with engineers and other session players for their next album. Daft Punk recalled that they wished to avoid the more compressed sounds of drum machines in favor of [...] "airy open" [...] drum sets of the 1970s and 80s, which the duo consider the most appealing era. Bangalter clarified that [...] "it's not that we can't make crazy futuristic sounding stuff, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> play with the past". The duo noted that the session players were enthusiastic to reunite {{in the context of}} the new album and the perceived prestige of the studio locations.|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't <b>want</b> him <b>to</b> swallow anything," [...] Sylvie explained. [...] "He's not hungry. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see him. So Will you please--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] said March hastily, [...] "we've {{heard of}} him, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hear more {{particularly}} about him, for the accounts don't all agree." ...|$|R

500|$|Some {{characters}} who previously appeared in War for Cybertron feature updated appearances and transformation schemes, or moving parts that animate regardless of player action, similar to breathing. The character Optimus Prime was redesigned for a [...] "more warrior-type feel", with more bulk {{added to his}} body mass. The weaponry in Fall of Cybertron was also modified and enhanced; the designers of the game put out a call {{to everyone in the}} studio for new weapon ideas. Matt Tieger of High Moon explained that in addition to new designs, each weapon could be upgraded, continuing, [...] "We really made a conscious choice to make every upgrade a significant improvement, so one upgrade might increase your firing speed by 75%. We could have made the system so {{that there were a lot}} of upgrades that each improved your guns a little bit, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make each upgrade feel like this giant thing. That way when players buy it they’re really going to feel the difference." ...|$|E
500|$|The group's {{voices are}} {{presented}} individually on the record. Savan Kotecha {{noted that the}} Backstreet Boys' late-’90s hits inspired the way he formulated One Direction's voices for the album. Composer Julian Bunetta, who worked on three of Take Me Home tracks, also tried to place emphasis on the sound of each member: [...] "The fans can tell the difference, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{make sure that when}} it came on the radio, the average person knew that it must be One Direction, because it’s five guys." [...] Likewise, Caramanica noted that the album's songs produced by Bunetta [...] "tend to start out with more breathing room, giving the guys a chance to show off vocally". The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, and commitment, in songs such as [...] "Little Things," [...] "Last First Kiss," [...] "Back For You," [...] and [...] "They Don't Know About Us." [...] Other tracks, like [...] "Heart Attack," [...] "Rock Me," [...] "I Would," [...] and [...] "Over Again," [...] have a more solemn tone, addressing jealousy and longing for past significant others.|$|E
500|$|Inclement weather {{continued}} {{to disrupt the}} Saturday's proceedings as qualifying was delayed multiple times before being ultimately rescheduled for Sunday morning. Many drivers backed the decision, with Jenson Button saying: [...] "It {{was the right thing}} to do [...] In one respect, maybe if we decided three hours earlier it would have been better for the fans. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get out there and drive and put on a show. Delaying it every half an hour was the way it had to be." [...] During the waiting period on Saturday, many teams had engaged in tomfoolery in the paddock to entertain the crowds, such as bowling or ballroom dancing between Red Bull teammates Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat. Ferrari later condemned the behaviour of their fellow teams, with team principal Maurizio Arrivabene saying: [...] "We are a Formula One team, not the Cirque du Soleil." [...] Kimi Räikkönen backed him, stating: [...] "I think this is F1 and not the circus. The people are obviously not happy when we're not running but we cannot make them happy with whatever we do apart from running." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, dear. I know {{it sounds}} as if all their insides were coming out of their mouth. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be serenaded, don't we, nurse?--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} latter thoughtfully, [...] "I guess his packers will be asleep in camp, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get there before {{he does and}} he's gone off first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will pay}} up, never fear. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> sell off all our stuff first. Will {{you let me}} write out a notice to that effect and post it outside?" ...|$|R
500|$|Shearer {{said in an}} {{interview}} that [...] "The animating impulse was to do rock 'n' roll right. The four of us had been around rock 'n' roll and we were just amazed by how relentlessly the movies got it wrong. Because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get it right." [...] When they tried to sell it to various Hollywood studios, they were told that the film would not work. The group kept saying, [...] "No, this is a story that's pretty familiar to people. We're not introducing them to anything they don't really know," [...] so Shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with the public. The film was only a modest success upon its initial release but found greater success, and a cult following, after its video release. In 2000, the film was ranked 29th on the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 comedy movies in American cinema and it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".|$|E
500|$|Munroe {{stated in}} terms of the story line that ideas were floated as extreme as the Turtles being in space, but {{eventually}} it just came back to New York City, and the theme of the family that had fallen apart. When developing the screenplay, Munroe wanted to take on a less lighthearted tone or [...] "less Cowabunga" [...] and place an emphasis on dark elements as shown in the original comics to appeal to the mature audience. [...] "I had a very specific tone because mixing that sort of action and comedy is a very specific thing. Most people were just coming and wanting to make it too funny. I think that version of the movie could do really well, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do something where it sort of pushes the envelope a little bit more and says that animation is more than just comedic animals bumping into each other and farting!" [...] Munroe said that in design and in the rendering of the animation, he was after the feel of a comic book. Karai was one of Munroe's favoriite characters from the comics and he [...] "was the one who really pushed for Karai" [...] to appear in the film. TMNT co-creator Peter Laird stated it takes place in its own universe separate from the previous films. However, director Munroe says the film exists in the same continuity as the other films, which was supported by the memento wall {{at the end of the}} film.|$|E
500|$|After much research, Nolan's {{brother and}} co-writer, Jonathan, {{suggested}} the Joker's first two appearances, {{published in the}} first issue of Batman (1940), as the crucial influences. Christopher had Jonathan watch Fritz Lang's 1933 crime film The Testament of Dr. Mabuse prior to writing the Joker, with the Joker resembling Mabuse's characteristics. Christopher Nolan referred to Lang's film as [...] "essential research for anyone attempting to write a supervillain". Jerry Robinson, one of the Joker's co-creators, was consulted on the character's portrayal. Nolan decided to avoid divulging an in-depth origin story for the Joker, and instead portray his rise to power so as to not diminish the threat he poses, explaining to MTV News, [...] "the Joker we meet in The Dark Knight is fully formed... To me, the Joker is an absolute. There are no shades of gray to him– maybe shades of purple. He's unbelievably dark. He bursts in just as he did in the comics." [...] Nolan reiterated to IGN, [...] "We never wanted to do an origin story for the Joker in this film," [...] because [...] "the arc of the story is much more Harvey Dent's; the Joker is presented as an absolute. It's a very thrilling element in the film, and a very important element, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> deal with the rise of the Joker, not the origin of the Joker." [...] Nolan suggested [...] influenced a section of the Joker's dialogue in the film, in which he says that anyone can become like him given the right circumstances. Nolan also cited Heat as [...] "sort of an inspiration" [...] for his aim [...] "to tell a very large, city story or the story of a city": [...] "If you want to take on Gotham, you want to give Gotham a kind of weight and breadth and depth in there. So you wind up dealing with the political figures, the media figures. That's part of the whole fabric of how a city is bound together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure we can, by {{the aid of}} {{the hooks}} and ropes, and the horses. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be careful how it's done. There is no sense in {{breaking}} the machine still more." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. H. Mr. Hornblower, you had better, {{decide that}} after hearing what it is--we shall be {{quite ready to}} repeat it in her presence; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do as little harm as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "We can go ahead, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be mighty careful. Don't {{take a step}} {{until you}} are sure of your footing. If you find {{yourself}} sinking, grab hold of some tree or bush." ...|$|R
500|$|The writers {{felt this}} {{approach}} was similar to how Stan Lee reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with [...] "the Captain dealing {{with all sorts of}} the same things that the country [...] dealing with–Vietnam, Watergate and all that stuff–so he gets to have opinions on that", thus making the [...] "guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world that we live in." [...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back to things like [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed by the Reagan Era followed by where we are today. In the comics it {{was a hell of a}} journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor. And in our film that takes the form of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
2500|$|Led Zeppelin III {{was not one}} of {{the best}} sellers in the {{catalogue}} because the audience turned round and said 'What {{are we supposed to do}} with this?'—'Where is our 'Whole Lotta Love Part 2'? They wanted something like Paranoid by Black Sabbath! <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go acoustic and a piece like [...] "Gallows Pole" [...] still had all the power of [...] "Whole Lotta Love" [...] because it allowed us to be dynamic.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of {{the video}} to MTV, Reynolds said [...] "We read through a ton of scripts from really talented directors, and we came across one that stood out to us in particular, because it put into visuals the general theme of the song, {{which is kind of}} an {{empowering}} song about an awakening, but it did {{it in a way that}} was very different". [...] "A lot of people probably see a post-apocalyptic world when they hear 'Radioactive', understandably, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> deliver something that was maybe a little different from that ... a lot different from that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know {{lots and}} lots more,'said Dan. 'How you got home--and what old Maingon said on the barge--and wasn't your cousin {{surprised}} {{when he had to}} give back the BERTHE AURETTE, and--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is all right, <b>but,</b> by Jove! <b>we</b> {{have had}} a shaver. I will tell you all in a moment, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> keep the thing quiet, and so let the fellows disperse, and we will talk afterwards.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you think}} best, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{know all that}} goes on. I can't bear to be battened down like {{passengers}} in a storm at sea; there is nothing so trying <b>to</b> nerves. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be on deck with the captain if the storm breaks." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{album was}} titled War for several reasons; in 1982, Bono said, [...] "War {{seemed to be}} the motif for 1982," [...] adding that [...] "Everywhere you looked, from the Falklands to the Middle East and South Africa, there was war. By calling the album War we're giving people {{a slap in the face}} and at the same time getting away from the cosy image a lot of people have of U2." [...] The Edge said that [...] "It's a heavy title. It's blunt. It's not {{something}} that's safe, so it could backfire. It's the sort of subject matter that people can really take a dislike to. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> take a more dangerous course, fly a bit closer to the wind, so I think the title is appropriate." [...] The boy on the cover is Peter Rowen (brother of Bono's friend, Guggi). He also appears on the covers of Boy, Three, The Best of 1980–1990, Early Demos and many singles. Bono described the reasoning behind the cover: [...] "Instead of putting tanks and guns on the cover, we've put a child's face. War can also be a mental thing, an emotional thing between loves. It doesn't have to be a physical thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009 Alkaline Trio {{announced}} {{the formation of}} their own independent record label, created as {{a joint venture with}} Epitaph Records {{in a manner similar to}} ANTI- and Hellcat Records. Epitaph had previously released Patent Pending, the 2006 album by Skiba's side project Heavens. Named Heart & Skull after Alkaline Trio's logo, the new label would be inaugurated by the release of their new album. Skiba remarked that [...] "We made the decision to form Heart & Skull to put out our own records after having been through every kind of label deal in the industry, big indies, small indies, majors. We knew it was time to adapt to the shifting tides of the music industry and we could not be more thrilled about doing that in conjunction with the team at Epitaph." [...] Singer and bassist Dan Andriano added: [...] "For our band at this time it really makes sense to release our own records, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make sure we could partner up with good people who we would want to share in something very special to us. When Brett [...] called and said he wanted to be involved, that was it. Epitaph is a label I've admired and supported for more than half of my life." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Manitoba's all right!" [...] another declared. [...] "We'll {{send them}} all the flour they want, besides men who can ride and shoot.

6000|$|... "Sure," [...] agreed Charnock. [...] "We did {{watch out}} and blew the whistle; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do the square thing. If Pearson got hurt and can't work, let him {{show you the}} bruise. We'll stand for his pay until you think he's fit to begin again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{there is}} just {{nothing to be done}} to-night," [...] said the Squire; [...] "nor for some days to come perhaps, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> have you prepared." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{rushed into}} the room pouring out: [...] "I'm afraid you'll think the {{teachers}} have been shabby in not coming near you, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{give you a chance}} to get settled.

[...] "We {{are both}} sorry to {{have had to go}} about the thing in this roundabout way, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> avoid a fuss. I think we had better be getting away.
