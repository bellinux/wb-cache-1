25|$|Astrologically speaking, Venus is {{associated}} with the principles of harmony, resilience, beauty, refinement, solidarity, affections, equality, and the urge to sympathize and unite with others. It is involved with the desire for pleasure, comfort and ease. It governs romantic relations, marriage and business partnerships, sex (the origin of the words 'venery' and 'venereal'), the arts, fashion and social life. The 1st-century poet Marcus Manilius described Venus as generous and fecund and the lesser <b>benefic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 1st-century poet Manilius {{described}} Jupiter as temperate and benign, and {{the greater}} <b>benefic.</b> It was regarded as warm and moist in nature, and therefore favorable to life.

In modern astrology, Jupiter is the primary native ruler of the ninth house, but traditionally, Jupiter was assigned to both the second and ninth houses: the house of values and the house of beliefs, respectively, and had its joy in the eleventh house of good luck.|$|E

Natural malefics owning auspicious bhavas, when they act as yogakarakas, tend to produce good results. These are the basic rules concerning planetary aspects.|$|R

However, the road was never built; first because Guatemalan and Belizeans could not reach an agreement of the exact location for the road, and later because the conservatives lost power in Guatemala in 1871, and the liberal government declared the treaty void.|$|E

In a Capricorn Lagna nativity that had Rahu in the 5th, Mars in the 6th, Saturn in the 7th, the Sun and the Moon in the 8th, Venus and Mercury in the 9th, Jupiter and Ketu in the 11th despite a powerful Bhagya Yoga obtaining and all three natural <b>benefics</b> being placed ahead of the Sun and the Moon the lady did not receive Diksha because Saturn did not aspect the Moon or its dispositor, and Mars did not aspect the 9th house.|$|R

If we had eyes to see it, a bit of stone from the city wall would certify us of the necessity that man must exist, as readily as the city. That identity makes us all one, and reduces to nothing great intervals on our customary scale. We talk of deviations from natural life, as if artificial life were not also natural. The smoothest curled courtier in the boudoirs of a palace has an animal nature, rude and aboriginal as a white bear, omnipotent to its own ends, and is directly related, there amid essences and billets-doux, to Himalaya mountain-chains[509] and the axis of the globe. If we consider how much we are nature's, we need not be superstitious about towns, as if that terrific or <b>benefic</b> force did not find us there also, and fashion cities. Nature, who made the mason, made the house. We may easily hear too much of rural influences. The cool, disengaged air of natural objects, makes them enviable to us, chafed and irritable creatures with red faces, {{and we think we}} shall be as grand as they, if we camp out and eat roots, but let us be men instead of wood-chucks, and the oak and the elm shall gladly serve us, though we sit in chairs of ivory on carpets of silk.|$|E
50|$|In astrology, a <b>benefic</b> planet, {{or simply}} <b>benefic,</b> is a planet {{considered}} {{to have a positive}} influence upon those it rules.

50|$|Jataka Tattva reiterates {{that the}} person whose lord of the 10th house is in {{conjunction}} with <b>benefic</b> planets (Sutra X.19) or is hemmed and aspected by <b>benefic</b> planets (Sutra X.22) or is situated in a navamsa owned by a <b>benefic</b> planet (Sutra X.20), becomes renowned, however, any association with evil planets earns bad name only, makes one notorious (Sutra X.23) and makes his father suffer (Sutra X.57). Raja yoga arises if the 10th house formed by a fixed sign is occupied by {{the lord of the}} lagna and Jupiter is in a kendrasthana (Sutra X.148) or if the strong lord of the 10th house from the Natal Moon is in a kendra, in the 9th or in the 2nd from the Lagna (Sutra X.160).|$|E
50|$|The trikonas are as {{sensitive}} as the kendras if not more; {{planets in}} mutual trikonas become effective co-workers. The antra-dasha {{of the planet}} situated in a kendra or in a trikona from the dasha-lord generally confers auspicious results. The Sun in the 4th, a retrograde Venus in the 5th with Jupiter situated in the lagna, or Saturn in the 9th, Mars exalted, and Mercury, Venus and Jupiter combining in the 5th house give rise to powerful Raja yogas which yogas illustrate the importance and effectiveness of the trinal aspects of planets more particularly that of Jupiter. If the <b>benefic</b> sign rising in the lagna is occupied by a <b>benefic</b> planet and {{the lord of the}} lagna , also a natural <b>benefic,</b> occupies a <b>benefic</b> sign in the 9th house then they invariably make one fortunate, long-lived and enjoy Raja yoga. But the kendras dominated by cruel malefic planets usually prove counter-productive, they prevent effective operation of yogas and Raja yogas, which situation becomes worse with the lord of the lagna and the lord of the 9th afflicted and ill-placed, and not favourably influencing their own bhavas.|$|E
50|$|Saturn or Mars or the Sun {{otherwise}} occupying or aspecting the 9th house do not tend to give {{good results}} {{but they can}} give rise to Raja yoga or confer much wealth. Jataka Parijata (Sloka VII.4) states that Raja yoga arises if strong <b>benefics</b> are situated in the lagna, the 7th and the 10th, and Mars and Saturn are in the 9th and the 11th. Saravali (Sloka XXXV.95) states that Raja yoga arises in case strong <b>benefics</b> are in the lagna, the 4th and the 7th and the Sun, Mars and Saturn are in the 3rd, 9th and the 11th house. Jataka Parijata (Sloka VII.12) states that the Sun in the 3rd, the Moon in the 9th and Jupiter in the 5th, all vested with strength, make one powerful and very rich. Saravali (Sloka XXXV.168) states that similar would be the result if from Mars, Jupiter, the Moon and the Sun happen to occupy the 5th, the 9th and the 3rd bhavas in any order avoiding debilitation signs and navamsas. Vaidyanatha states that the son born during the antra-dasa of {{the lord of the}} 5th house conjoining with Rahu will be short-lived but the son born during the antra-dasa of Rahu will live long.|$|R
50|$|The Birth Chart or Horoscope drawn for {{the time}} of birth verily {{indicates}} when events are bound to happen, and the Shashtiamsa Chart tells why events happen {{in the life of}} the native; both charts complement each other. Jataka Tattva tells us that the lord of the 10th house occupying evil vargas owned by evil planets and situated in cruel shashtiamsa makes one notorious. But, if the lord of the 10th associating with <b>benefics</b> is in the 5th shashtiamsa then he will be an able leader and ruler.|$|R
5000|$|The Yoga-karaka is {{the planet}} which rules a Kendra ('Angular house') and a Trikona ('Trine') simultaneously. Thus, Saturn is the yoga-karaka for Taurus and Libra, Mars for Cancer and Leo, Venus for Gemini, Virgo, Capricorn and Aquarius, and the Moon, for Scorpio sign. The Sun, Mercury and Jupiter do not attain this status {{which the two}} Lunar Nodes can if they are aspected or {{associated}} with the lord of a kendra or a trikona. [...] Yoga-karakas are first rate functional <b>benefics,</b> they are particularly suited to benefit a person materially and in status.|$|R
50|$|The 10th {{house and}} its lord are an {{important}} factor in the formation of yogas and Raja yogas. Venkatesa Sarma in his Sarvartha Chintamani (Sloka VIII.15-23) explains that the lord of the 10th house a <b>benefic</b> associated with or aspected by another <b>benefic</b> makes one exercise ruling or administrative powers. If the lord of the 10th occupies a kendra and the Sun also joins Mars in the 10th house or if Saturn joins the lord of the 10th in a kendra in a cruel shastiamsa along with the lord of the 8th he will be a harsh and a cruel administrator. If the lord of the 10th associating with benefics is in the 5th shashtiamsa then he will be an able leader and ruler. Best results are experienced in case the lord of the Chandra-lagna associates with benefics is hemmed by benefics and, the lord of the 10th, a <b>benefic,</b> is exalted or in a friendly sign gaining many <b>benefic</b> vargas. He states that the lord of the 10th house even though associating with papa-grahas will confer Raja yoga provided all planets severally occupy the first six bhavas counted from the lagna (IX.31).|$|E
50|$|Upachayasthanas, {{which are}} houses {{of growth and}} expansion, confer good or bad results {{according}} {{to the nature of}} the planets occupying them; <b>benefic</b> planets situated therein generally help one earn and accumulate riches. Malefic planets occupying the upachayasthanas give gains not without physical struggles and anxiety, whereas <b>benefic</b> planets give gains with less physical struggle and more yield.Planets that own the 3rd, the 6th, or the 11th bhava are deemed malefics. Malefic planets occupying the upachayasthanas cause struggle, effort and eventual success.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the basic}} {{principles}} of Hindu astrology the signs that are owned by natural benefics are auspicious signs as also those that are even signs and the shirshodaya signs (those rising with the head first); the odd signs, prashtodaya signs (those rising with their hind-portion first) and the signs owned by natural malefic are not auspicious signs; benefics become more <b>benefic</b> by occupying shirshodya signs. However, Jatakadeshmarga (p. 171) explains that natural malefics confer good results if they are not evilly inclined and are strong in shadabala i.e. occupy own, friendly or exalted rasi, hora, drekkena, navamsa, dwadasamsa and trimsamsa, and thus occupying <b>benefic</b> vargas (sub-divisions of signs) are aspected by benefics occupying <b>benefic</b> vargas; natural benefics that are weak in shadabala and occupying evil vargas are aspected by evil planets occupying evil vargas do not confer good results expected of them.|$|E
50|$|Here, night {{includes}} day-time. People {{are seldom}} {{aware of the}} exact time of conception, therefore, traditionally these and other relevant planetary combinations a few cited hereat if found present in the prasna-charts are taken to indicate same results. If {{at the time of}} commencement of menses the lagna for that moment is aspected by Mars the woman will have sexual union with an evil person; if aspected by the Sun, with a noble ruler and if aspected by Saturn, with a servant. She will have a safe and pregnancy in case <b>benefics</b> influence the lagna, the Moon and the trines and the quadrants or if malefic are in the 3rd or the 11th aspected by the Sun.|$|R
50|$|If <b>benefics</b> aspect the Bandhana yogas afore-detailed {{then the}} {{troubles}} are temporary but if malefics aspect then {{the person is}} likely to suffer very harsh treatment. The Lagna or {{the lord of the}} lagna and the Moon afflicted by a cruel malefic or malefics, the 4th house and its lord or the 9th house and its lord or the 10th house and its lord similarly afflicted make one commit evil deeds, become a criminal and suffer punishment at the hands of authorities. A person takes to a career of crime if at the time of birth Rahu afflicts the Moon and the lord of the 10th. Ketu situated in the 10th house makes one commit vile deeds and be impure in his resolves.|$|R
50|$|Phaladeepika is a {{treatise}} on Hindu astrology written by Mantreswara. The text {{is written in}} lyrical Sanskrit verse comprises 865 slokas and 28 chapters. It {{is one of the}} more significant works on Hindu astrology, along with Bṛhat Parāśara Horāśāstra of Parashara, Brihat Jataka of Varahamihira, and Jataka Parijata of Vaidyanatha Dikshita. It deals in a most comprehensive and authoritative manner with almost all astrological aspects of human life. Mantreswara has equated a retrograde planet with an exalted planet in strength and effects even though it be in an inimical or its debilitation sign differing with Saravali which states that <b>benefics</b> are powerful when retrograde and cause Raja yoga (Hindu astrology) but malefic when retrograde do not confer favourable results.|$|R
50|$|Vaidyanatha Dikshita in his Jataka Parijata {{states that}} a planet will give better or {{exceptional}} results {{if it is}} situated in {{the centre of the}} bhava occupied by it, the results will minimise the more it is removed from the centre or if it has gained more and more <b>benefic</b> bindus in the Sarva Ashtakavarga or if it occupies the lagna, the 10th or the 11th house or it is exalted, in own or friendly vargas or occupies favourable bhavas in yoga with <b>benefic</b> bhava-lords and karakas. The mahadasa of the planet owning the sign occupied by either Mandi or Gulika or in conjunction with Mandi or gaining very few <b>benefic</b> bindus or occupying its inimical or debilitation sign or combust or afflicted by papa-grahas or in Rasi-sandhi or in Bhava-sandhi or in adverse association with malefics will give poor results.|$|E

50|$|As per Jaimini the {{financial}} {{status of a}} person is indicated by the Lagnarudha and its lord. Arudha lagna associated with <b>benefics</b> gives wealth, if the 2nd house from this lagna is occupied by Venus, Moon and Jupiter or if the Arudha rasi of the 7th house {{happens to be a}} kendra or trikona or the 3rd or 11th from Lagnarudha the person will be very wealthy. Poverty is indicated if the Arudha rasi of the 7th falls on the 6th, the 8th or the 12th from Lagnarudha. There will be destruction of wealth through association with women of ill-repute if the 9th from Karakamsa is joined by Rahu. Karakamsa is the navamsa occupied by the Atmakaraka, the planet most advanced in any one sign in one's natal chart.|$|R
50|$|A {{retrograde}} planet at {{the time}} of birth affects a person immensely by its qualities. If more than one planet is retrograde then the planet most advanced in a sign affects the most. An exalted planet when retrograde certainly loses its power to help but a debilitated planet which is retrograde becomes more helpful in many possible ways; in fact the debilitated and retrograde planet situated in its exaltation navamsa becomes very helpful. Natural <b>benefics</b> i.e. Mercury, Venus and Jupiter, if owning the 4th, the 7th or the 10th house and retrograde become more adverse and spoil the house they own, occupy and aspect. On the other hand natural malefics such as the Mars and Saturn, become more helpful. Retrograde Jupiter gives results of the bhava it occupied at birth, rest give the results of the bhava in which they began retrograding.|$|R
