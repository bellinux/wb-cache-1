In previous years, his descendants from South Wales have been invited back to the geographical milestone. Harry <b>Bluck's</b> legend is still told throughout the world and still spoken with fear by sailors.|$|R

50|$|<b>Bluck</b> {{returned}} to Hong Kong in January 1971 as {{the managing director}} of Cathay Pacific. <b>Bluck</b> persuaded the company to introduce its first long-haul Boeing 707s and its first wide-bodied aircraft, the Lockheed TriStar in 1973 and 1975 respectively. With the new aircraft, Cathay was able to expand its route network substantially. In 1976, the airline started its first expansion by flying to Bahrain.|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 1981, <b>Bluck</b> was {{appointed}} chairman, the taipan of the Swire in Hong Kong, and served simultaneously {{as chairman of}} all the major Swire companies in Hong Kong. Under his spell, <b>Bluck</b> {{was known for his}} determined focus and perfectionism, qualities particularly admired by his Chinese colleagues. During his time, the company expanded in particular of the property field. By the end of <b>Bluck's</b> tenure in 1984, Cathay Pacific had been transformed into a major international carrier. He was also the director of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, chairman of the Hong Kong Tourist Association and the English Schools Federation and member of the financial committee of the University of Hong Kong. In 1984, he was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).|$|R

50|$|On {{his first}} leave, <b>Bluck</b> was engaged with Stella and married in March 1952. The couple {{was known to}} be kind to the junior staff.|$|R
5000|$|Robert <b>Bluck</b> {{explained}} {{that as a}} consequence of opening Madhayamaka Centre, Lama Yeshe asked for Kelsang Gyatso's resignation, [...] "but his students petitioned him to remain, and a struggle ensued for control of Manjushri Institute, which eventually withdrew from the FPMT." [...] Although some FPMT students regarded Kelsang Gyatso as a [...] "rogue geshe" [...] {{as a result of his}} separation from the FPMT, <b>Bluck</b> suggests an alternative view: [...] "FPMT teachers became increasingly remote, with Kelsang Gyatso's single-minded approach and personal example inspiring many students." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1954, <b>Bluck</b> {{took up the}} {{position}} of commercial manager of the Cathay Pacific {{at the age of}} 27, the airline's most senior non-engineering post. During his spell, he was able to acquire the northbound routes at the time the routes from Hong Kong to Mainland China, Taiwan and Japan were given by the government to Hong Kong Airways (HKA), a subsidiary of the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). The HKA had to sellits fleet and chartered out its traffic rights to the American Northwest Airlines after it lost the Mainland market. <b>Bluck</b> foresaw the potential of the Japanese market, and thus he asked for the northbound rights from the government, unless HKA flew its own planes. In 1959, the BOAC swapped HKA for a part of the shares in the Cathay Pacific as predicted by <b>Bluck,</b> and thus opened the Japanese and Taiwanese market to Cathay.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} the boss of the Swire Group, Jock Swire was knocked out of the Hong Kong-Sydney route by Qantas, the Australian state carrier. <b>Bluck</b> belonged to the pro-expansion lobby with Bill Knowles, opposed to the anti-expansionists {{including}} Jock Browne and John Browne. John Bremridge, the managing director held a middle position but leaned towards Jock-like caution. <b>Bluck</b> gave a vision of global expansionism in a report he wrote after a five-week tour in North America in 1961, pointing out the potential business opportunity in the United States.|$|R
50|$|The {{royalties}} {{from the}} print and stage versions of The Wizard of Oz were sufficient to allow Denslow to purchase <b>Bluck's</b> Island, Bermuda, and crown himself King Denslow I.|$|R

50|$|<b>Bluck</b> {{remarks that}} there remains an {{apparent}} contradiction between claiming a pure Tibetan lineage and separating completely from contemporary Tibetan tradition. While the NKT strongly emphasizes its unbroken 'lineage', {{it has no}} Tibetan followers and claims to stand outside current Tibetan Buddhism.|$|R
60|$|The {{singularity}} was, {{that all}} {{were of the}} same opinion: everybody cheered him, every house was adorned with his colours. His triumphal return was no party question. Magog Wrath and Bully <b>Bluck</b> walked together like lambs {{at the head of}} his procession.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Bluck</b> {{notes the}} {{activity}} regarding Dorje Shugden {{practice in the}} 80s: In the early 1980s the Dalai Lama restricted reliance on Dorje Shugden to private rather than public practice. The tension this caused within the Gelug and wider Tibetan community may reflect some opposition to his ecumenical approach.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bluck</b> has {{conceptualized}} {{several reasons}} people tell narratives. One reason is for directive purposes, which involves transmitting {{information regarding the}} future. Additionally, stories are told for social reasons, in particular communication, persuasion, and entertainment purposes. Finally, narrators can benefit by expressing themselves, in addition to giving life purpose and meaning.|$|R
6000|$|This was {{a signal}} for the instant {{appearance}} of {{the leader of the}} Liberal mob. Magog Wrath, not so tall as Bully <b>Bluck,</b> his rival, had a voice almost as powerful, a back much broader, and a countenance far more forbidding. 'Now, my boys, the Queen and Millbank for ever!' ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Bluck</b> {{was born}} in Shanghai on 19 March 1927. His father Thomas was a draper's {{assistant}} in Leicester as a young man. He joined the department store, Whiteaway, Laidlaw & Co. and was sent to its Shanghai branch. Duncan was named after Major General Sir John Duncan, commander of the Shanghai Defence Force.|$|R
50|$|A carerr-changing {{opportunity}} came in 1953, when <b>Bluck</b> {{was sent}} to Bangkok {{to open a new}} branch for the Cathay Pacific Airways. At the time, the fleet consisted of only two DC-3s and one DC-4 Skymaster. The DC-4 operated the Hong Kong-Bangkok-Singapore route five times a day and a weekly Hong Kong-Bangkok-Calcutta flight.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bluck</b> {{aimed to}} expand the airline's network to London, which was monopolised by the British Airways by that time. Equipped with Boeing 747, Cathay {{launched}} its first challenge with Caledonian Airways (B-Cal) and the low-cost carrier, Laker Airways. After a series of hearing before the Hong Kong's Air Transport Licensing Authority, licences were granted to Cathay Pacific and B-Cal. However, the CCA in London revoked Cathay's licence, {{on the basis that}} the B-Cal's DC-10 was more suitable to operate the route. Swire appealed to the Minister of State for Trade. All three carriers were given licences at the end as a compromise. On the next day, <b>Bluck's</b> team hanged up the huge banners with the message [...] "Cathay Pacific flies to London" [...] as a sign of success. Following the London route, the company subsequently acquired routes to North America.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1945, Winmau was {{acquired}} by rival dartboard manufacturer Nodor in 2002, with both brands remaining in production. The company is based in Bridgend in south Wales although manufacturing of the boards takes place in Kenya. The company was bought by great entrepreneur John <b>Bluck.</b> His eldest son Vince is now the directing manager.|$|R
5000|$|R.S. <b>Bluck,</b> {{although}} unimpressed {{by previous}} arguments against the dialogue's authenticity, tentatively suggests a date {{after the end}} of Plato's life, approximately 343/2 BC, based especially on [...] "a striking parallelism between the Alcibiades and early works of Aristotle, as well as certain other compositions that probably belong to the same period as the latter." ...|$|R
5000|$|While the Je Tsongkhapa and Dorje Shugden {{practices}} are recited daily, NKT-IKBU practitioners also regularly perform {{a number of}} other ritual practices, including Avalokiteshvara, Heruka, Vajrayogini, Tara, Manjushri, Amitayus and the Medicine Buddha. <b>Bluck</b> notes that [...] "All these sādhanas have either been 'compiled from traditional sources' by Geshe Kelsang or translated under his supervision." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Robert <b>Bluck,</b> [...] "Most {{teachers}} are appointed to centres by Kelsang Gyatso {{before they have}} completed the Teaching Training Programme and continue studying by correspondence, with an intensive study programme at Manjushri each summer." [...] Daniel Cozort explained that this is [...] "rather like graduate students who teach undergraduate courses while pursuing their own Ph.D.'s." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{expression}} was termed by Habermas and <b>Bluck</b> (2000), {{along with other}} terms such as temporal coherence, biographical coherence, and causal coherence, to describe the coherence that people talk about while narrating their own personal experiences (the many different episodes in their life, most especially in childhood and adolescence) which need to be structured within a context.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bluck</b> {{attributes}} NKT-IKBU's {{rapid growth}} to [...] "a wish {{to share the}} Dharma rather than ‘conversion and empire-building’." [...] Kay says that the NKT-IKBU is sensitive to criticism {{on the subject of}} expansion and cites Kelsang Gyatso's response to any criticisms about its outreach efforts, stating that [...] "every organization 'tries to attract more people with appropriate publicity.'" ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Bluck</b> was a keen yachtsman, {{regularly}} {{competing in}} Hong Kong-Macau races during his residence in Hong Kong. {{he had also}} sailed in Yokohama Bay until he was arrested by US coastguards. He settled in Kent after he returned to England. In later years he had {{a house in the}} South of France, where he sailed his last yacht, Stella Maris.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, Cathay Pacific {{acquired}} {{its first}} jet aircraft, the Convair 880M {{and formed a}} joint venture air catering company with the Peninsula Group. The partnership provided the impetus to take on catering for other airlines which {{eventually led to the}} founding of the Cathay Pacific Catering Services. In April 1964, <b>Bluck</b> joined the Board of the Cathay Pacific Airways.|$|R
40|$|Storytelling is a {{ubiquitous}} {{human activity}} (Dunbar, 2005; Swearingen, 1990) that occurs across cultures (Freeman, 2001; Strawbridge, 2005; Wang, 2004). Most {{of the literature}} on narrative text recall has used fictional stories or other laboratory-based materials. The current research focuses on differences as well as continuities (Baltes, Staudinger, & Lindenberger, 1999) in memory sharing among younger and older adults using ecologically relevant materials: self-generated autobiographical memory stories about a specific event. Such stories are commonly shared in daily life and across most of the lifespan. Individuals of all ages, after about age five (Nelson & Fivush, 2004), tell autobiographical memory stories. Sharing personal stories can be fun and entertaining but scholarly research on such stories is also gaining momentum due to their psychosocial functions (McAdams, 2003). Sharing autobiographical memory stories can serve three broad functions: self, social, and directive (<b>Bluck,</b> 2003; <b>Bluck</b> & Alea, 2002; Cohen, 1998). That is, it may aid in self-definitio...|$|R
50|$|In 1968, <b>Bluck</b> {{was sent}} to Nassau to take over as {{chairman}} of the Bahamas Airways, which Swire in conjunction with P&O and Blue Funnel Line acquired from the BOAC. During his two-year chairmanship, the airways crumpled financially as the Bahamian government exclusively licensed the national carrier BAL to fly long haul routes. Swire had to put the airline into voluntary liquidation as a result.|$|R
