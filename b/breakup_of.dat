50|$|There are no {{reliable}} hypotheses {{about the nature}} <b>of</b> the subsequent <b>breakups</b> <b>of</b> West and South Slavic. East Slavic is generally thought to converge to one Old Russian or Old East Slavonic language, which existed until at least the 12th century.|$|R
5|$|All six {{boats were}} {{completed}} from 1985 to 1989 at the Brodogradilište Specijalnih Objekata (BSO) in Split, SR Croatia and named after rivers in SFR Yugoslavia: Tisa (P-911), Una (P-912), Zeta (P-913), Soča (P-914), Kupa (P-915) and Vardar (P-916).

5|$|By March 1991, the {{conflict}} had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence and in June 1991, with the <b>Breakup</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia, Croatia declared its independence.

50|$|Because {{the family}} is so ancient and was so widely {{distributed}} on the Gondwana supercontinent, modern species commonly occur in relict populations isolated by geographical barriers, for instance on islands or tropical mountains.

Her successes there, including two Academy Award nominations, were curtailed when her involvement in left-wing politics led to a place on the Hollywood blacklist.|$|E

50|$|The twelve {{teams in}} Group III {{were divided into}} two pools of six, each of which played a {{round-robin}} tournament. The top two teams in each pool were promoted to Group II for 1994.

5|$|The album Adios {{was written}} and {{performed}} almost exclusively by Konietzko and Skold. Ogre again provided vocals, as did German musician Nina Hagen.

40|$|A {{posterior}} modeling {{approach for}} on-orbit breakup, named ASSEMBLE (ASemi-Stochastic Environment Modeling <b>of</b> <b>Breakup</b> in LEO), is proposed. The main objectives {{of this paper}} are the statistical characterization of the orbital and physical parameters of the fragments generated by a non-orbit <b>breakup.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> two line element (TLE) data of the fragments of some fragmentation events, such as the Indian PSLV-TES rocket body breakup, showed their orbital parameters obey statistical distributions. The apogee or perigee height, limited by breakup altitude, and the inclination follow Laplace distributions, while the eccentricity a Lognormal distribution. Subsequently, suitable empirical relations in the literature help to expand the fragmentation scenario to mass, effective area, and ballistic coefficient. Lastly, the simulation <b>of</b> well-known historical <b>breakups</b> <b>of</b> (i) SPOT I rocket body,(ii) COSMOS 1813, (iii) STEP II rocket body, and (iv) CBERS I/ SAC Iprovide further confidence in the present model for orbital debrisstudies...|$|R
5|$|The <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> the Carolingian Empire was {{accompanied}} by invasions, migrations, and raids by external foes. The Atlantic and northern shores were harassed by the Vikings, who also raided the British Isles and settled there {{as well as in}} Iceland. In 911, the Viking chieftain Rollo (d. c. 931) received permission from the Frankish King Charles the Simple (r. 898–922) to settle in what became Normandy. The eastern parts of the Frankish kingdoms, especially Germany and Italy, were under continual Magyar assault until the invader's defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955. The <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> the Abbasid dynasty meant that the Islamic world fragmented into smaller political states, some of which began expanding into Italy and Sicily, as well as over the Pyrenees into the southern parts of the Frankish kingdoms.|$|E
