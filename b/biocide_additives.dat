40|$|AbstractThe biodeterioration {{process of}} concrete, having a sol-gel coating, under {{the impact of}} a wide range of live {{microorganisms}} - green algae, thionic and nitrifying bacteria and filamentous fungi - has been researched. As a <b>biocide</b> <b>additive</b> the biocidal composite material based on modified galvanic sludge in amount of 1 - 5 % of sol mass was used. It was determined that the coating including galvanic sludge demonstrates biocidal activity. Newly formed crystals of quartz, Portlandite, calcite, larnite, ettringite, gismondite, scawtite etc. were found on the surface of samples having no protective coating and exposed to microorganisms. Application of the suggested method of building materials protection is going to increase their durability, make it possible to recycle waste and to improve the environmental condition...|$|R
40|$|Dry {{construction}} mixes {{are today}} {{a product of}} high technologies. Depending on the purpose and requirements to the properties {{it is easy to}} produce dry construction mixes with different compositions and operating indicators in plant conditions using the necessary modifying additives. Cement, gypsum and other mineral binders are used in the construction mixes. Different types of cement are more heavily used in dry construction mixes. Such dry mixes are believed to be more effective materials comparing to traditional cement-sandy solutions of centralized preparation. The authors present the results of the investigations on obtaining biocidal cement-sand compositions. It was established, that introduction of sodium sulfate into the composition provides obtaining the materials with funginert and fungicide properties. The strength properties of the mixes modified by carbon nanotubes and <b>biocide</b> <b>additive</b> were investigated by mathematical planning methods. The results of the investigations showed that the modification of cement stone structure by carbon nanotubes positively influences their strength and technological properties. Nanomodifying of construction composites by introducing carbon nanotubes may be effectively used at different stages of structure formation of a construction material...|$|R

Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is known {{to be one of the}} most challenging processes in microelectronics manufacturing due to the number of variables involved in the design of the process. In particular, the slurries made of nano-sized particles and aggressive chemistries need to be characterized batch to batch and as a function of time to enable robust high volume manufacturing. In this study, the effect of slurry aging on CMP performance was investigated systematically for regular silica based slurry as well as for slurry containing an organic <b>biocide</b> <b>additive</b> to prevent bacteria formation. The parameters examined were particle size distribution, zeta potential, bacteria count, total organic carbon concentration, silicon ion dissolution, material removal rate (MRR), and surface quality. The results indicated that aging influenced slurry performance negatively and even with the addition of biocide, organic contamination was observed at the extended aging periods. The material removal rates decreased significantly by aging and more surface deformations were observed on the wafer surfaces polished with the slurries destabilized with the elapsed time. Slurries containing biocide were detected to be more prone to agglomeration and increase in particle size as the time passes after the slurry is exposed to the environment. Furthermore, the impact of short time slurry aging (conditioning) on particle properties of the slurries containing polymeric additives and the adverse affects of extreme stability in the slurries containing surfactants are also discussed in terms of the two other factors that can cause variability in CMP slurry performance.

40|$|Polycarbonate (PC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used engi-neering {{polymers}} due to its unusual combination of opti-cal clarity, heat resistance, high impact strength and dimensional stability over wide thermal range [1]. Low water absorption, ease of sterilization and biocompatibility of PC have led to its use in a wide range of medical equip-ment, including critical medical devices [2]. The preven-tion of biofilm formation on the internal medical devices is of great importance since it can initiate a degradation process of the material, as well as cause infections and health related problems [3]. In order to obtain antimicro-bial properties, polymers are usually compounded with organic or inorganic biocides [4, 5]. However, the use of organic <b>biocides</b> as <b>additives</b> for PC is significantly limited due to their insufficient thermal stability in the tempera...|$|R
40|$|Tests with {{vertebrates}} are {{an integral}} part of environmental hazard identification and risk assessment of chemicals, plant protection products, pharmaceuticals, <b>biocides,</b> feed <b>additives</b> and effluents. These tests raise ethical and economic concerns and are considered as inappropriate for assessing all of the substances and effluents that require regulatory testing. Hence, there is a strong demand for replacement, reduction and refinement strategies and methods. However, until now alternative approaches have only rarely been used in regulatory settings. This review provides an overview on current regulations of chemicals and the requirements for animal tests in environmental hazard and risk assessment. It aims to highlight the potential areas for alternative approaches in environmental hazard identification and risk assessment. Perspectives and limitations of alternative approaches to animal tests using vertebrates in environmental toxicology, i. e. mainly fish and amphibians, are discussed. Free access to existing (proprietary) animal test data, availability of validated alternative methods and a practical implementation of conceptual approaches such as the Adverse Outcome Pathways and Integrated Testing Strategies were identified as major requirements towards the successful development and implementation of alternative approaches.

40|$|On the {{initiative}} {{of a group of}} scientists, a meeting of experts has taken place on 11 and 12 April 2016 on the topic of substances that harm the hormonal system. The meeting was organised by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) with the aim of constructively promoting scientific discourse in this area. The precondition for determining whether the use of a specific product might result in a health risk to the consumer is the existence of a wellfounded scientific assessment of the endocrine disruptors that may be present in the product in question. There are currently differing opinions among scientists who work in this area of research with regard to the basic principles used for the assessment of substances that are harmful to the hormonal system. Substances that are foreign to the body can be designated as "endocrine disruptors" if they harm the health of an organism by altering the function of the hormonal system. Such substances can occur naturally in plants, be administered in medications or contained in chemical substances and products such as plant protection products, <b>biocides,</b> food <b>additives</b> or cosmetics. The findings of the meeting will be published on the BfR website and additionally in a scientific journal...|$|R

30|$|In a field study, {{micronucleus}} assay {{was shown}} to be applicable to micronucleus-inducing agents in frogs ([Saleh and Zeytinoğlu 2001]). The micronucleus test is simple and successful among many mutagenesis assays, which are both dependent on any karyotypic characteristics and less time consuming ([Heddle et al. 1991]). According to ([Hartwell et al. 2000]) and ([Fagr et al. 2008]), the incidence of micronuclei in fish and other aquatic life serves as an index {{of these types of}} damage, and counting of micronuclei is much faster and less technically demanding than scoring of chromosomal aberrations. The comet assay has been considered as a sensitive, rapid, and reliable method of quantitatively measuring DNA damage in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells ([Bajpayee et al. 2005]). It is increasingly being used in testing of substances such as industrial chemicals, <b>biocides,</b> agrochemical, food <b>additives,</b> and pharmaceuticals for genotoxicity testing ([Brendler-Schwaab et al. 2005]). Thus, for these reasons, comet assay and micronuclei test in fish erythrocyte seem to be promising tests in environmental genotoxicity and mutagenesis investigations. ([Andrade et al. 2004]).|$|R

40|$|Background: Nanotechnology {{applications}} can {{be found}} in agricultural production, animal feed, food processing, food additives and food contact materials (hereinafter referred to as agri/feed/food). A great diversity of nanomaterials is reported to be currently used in various applications, while new nanomaterials and applications are reported to be in development. Scope and approach: It is expected that applications of nanomaterials in agri/feed/food will increase in the future and thereby increase the human and environmental exposure to such materials. To gain up-to-date knowledge we explored and reviewed the already marketed and in-development applications of nanomaterials in the agri/feed/food sectors upon the request of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). In this paper the results of the project are highlighted and discussed in more detail. Key findings and conclusions: The majority of the applications of nanomaterials that we identified concerned application in food as food additives and food contact materials, while much fewer applications seem to be developed for agriculture and feed. Nano-encapsulates, silver, titanium dioxide and silica are the most often mentioned nanomaterials in the literature. About half of the identified applications are claimed to be already in use. In-development applications are found for nano-encapsulates and nano-composites in novel foods, food and feed <b>additives,</b> <b>biocides,</b> pesticides and food contact materials. </p...|$|R
40|$|Nanotechnology can {{contribute}} to the development of innovative applications in the agriculture, food and feed sector by e. g. enabling improved delivery of nutrients or increased efficacy of agrichemicals. It is expected that applications will increase in the near future and may therefore become a relevant source of human exposure to nanomaterials (NM). To gain more up-to date information, RIKILT and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) were commissioned by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to prepare an inventory of currently used and reasonably foreseen applications of NM in agriculture and food/feed production and carried out a review of regulatory aspects concerning NM in both EU and non-EU countries. An analysis of the information records in the inventory shows that nano-encapsulates, silver and titanium dioxide are the most frequent type of NM listed and that food additives and food contact materials are the most frequent types of application. A comparison between marketed applications and those in development indicates a trend from inorganic materials (e. g. silver) towards organic materials (nano-encapsulates, nanocomposites). Applications in novel food, feed <b>additives,</b> <b>biocides</b> and pesticides are currently mostly at a developmental stage. The review of EU and non-EU legislation shows that currently a few EU legal acts incorporate a definition of a nanomaterial and specific provisions for NM, whereas in many non-EU countries a broader approach is applied, which mainly builds on guidance for industry. </p...|$|R
40|$|The in vivo {{comet assay}} (single cell gel {{electrophoresis}} assay) in its alkaline version (pH 413) is being increasingly used in genotoxicity testing of substances such as industrial chemicals, <b>biocides,</b> agrochemicals, food <b>additives</b> and pharmaceuticals. Recommendations for an appropriate {{performance of the}} test using OECD guidelines for other in vivo genotoxicity tests have been published. In this review, we critically discuss the biological significance of comet assay effects {{in general and the}} status of the test in current strategies for genotoxicity testing. Examples for practical applications of the in vivo comet assay and poten-tial consequences of positive and negative test results are given. The significance of comet assay results for hazard identification and risk assessment is discussed. In accord-ance with international guidelines for genotoxicity testing the in vivo comet assay is recommended for follow-up test-ing of positive in vitro findings. It is particularly useful as a tool for the evaluation of local genotoxicity, especially for organs/cell types which cannot easily be evaluated with other standard tests. A positive result in an appropriately performed in vivo comet assay indicates genotoxicity of the test compound in the tissue tested and gains particular significance when a mutagenic potential of the test com-pound has already been demonstrated in vitro. Such find-ings will have practical consequences in the risk assessment processes and further development of substances...|$|R
