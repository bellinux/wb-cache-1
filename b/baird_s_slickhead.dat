50|$|American {{paleontologist}} Donald Baird named {{a second}} species of Spathicephalus, S. pereger, from Nova Scotia in 1962. <b>Baird</b> named <b>S.</b> pereger {{on the basis}} of an impression of the right half of a skull table that collectors from the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology found on a beach between Point Edward and Keating Cove on Cape Breton Island.

40|$|Cryptosporidium spp. are {{potential}} contaminants of food. Suspected cases of food-borne cryptosporidiosis are rarely confirmed {{because of the}} limited numbers of oocysts in the samples {{and the lack of}} sensitive detection methods adaptable to food. PCR was investigated as a means of overcoming this problem. A PCR assay was designed for the specific amplification of a previously sequenced portion of an oocyst protein gene fragment of Cryptosporidium parvum (N. C. Lally, G. D. <b>Baird,</b> <b>S.</b> J. McQuay, F. Wright, and J. J. Oliver, Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 56 : 69 - 78, 1992) and compared with the primer set of Laxer et al. (M. A. Laxer, B. K. Timblin, and R. J. Patel, Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 45 : 688 - 694, 1991). The PCR products were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled internal probes and detected by chemiluminescence to enhance sensitivity. The two sets of primers were compared with regard to their sensitivity and specificity by using a variety of human and animal isolates of C. parvum and related parasites. Both assays enabled the detection of 1 to 10 oocysts in 20 ml of artificially contaminated raw milk. The assay based on the PCR set and probe of Laxer et al. detected DNAs from Eimeria acervulina and Giardia intestinalis. The new assay has good specificity for C. parvum bovine isolates and hence has a better potential for monitoring the prevalence of C. parvum in raw milk and other environmental samples...|$|R

The first report of Albatross planktonic copepods was published in 1895 by Wilhelm Giesbrecht of the Naples Zoological Station. Other collections were sent to the Norwegian Georg Ossian Sars. The American Charles Branch Wilson eventually added planktonic copepods to his extensive published works on the parasitic copepods from the Albatross. The Albatross copepods from San Francisco Bay were reported upon by Calvin Olin Esterly in 1924. Henry Bryant Bigelow accompanied the last scientific cruise of the Albatross in 1920. Bigelow incorporated the 1920 copepods into his definitive study of the plankton of the Gulf of Maine. The late Otohiko Tanaka, in 1969, published two reviews of Albatross copepods.

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of DsRed, a red fluorescent protein from a corallimorpharian, {{has been determined}} at 2. 0 -Å resolution by multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion and crystallographic refinement. Crystals of the selenomethionine-substituted protein have space group P 21 and contain a tetramer with 222 noncrystallographic symmetry in the asymmetric unit. The refined model has satisfactory stereochemistry and a final crystallographic R factor of 0. 162. The protein, which forms an obligatory tetramer in solution and in the crystal, is a squat rectangular prism comprising four protomers whose fold is extremely {{similar to that of}} the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein despite low (≈ 23 %) amino acid sequence homology. The monomer consists of an 11 -stranded β barrel with a coaxial helix. The chromophores, formed from the primary sequence -Gln-Tyr-Gly- (residues 66 – 68), are arranged in a ≈ 27 × 34 -Å rectangular array in two approximately antiparallel pairs. The geometry at the α carbon of Gln- 66 (refined without stereochemical restraints) is consistent with an sp 2 hybridized center, in accord with the proposal that red fluorescence is because of an additional oxidation step that forms an acylimine extension to the chromophore [Gross, L. A., <b>Baird,</b> G. <b>S.,</b> Hoffman, R. C., Baldridge, K. K. & Tsien, R. Y. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 11990 – 11995].
