5|$|Beginning in 1964, {{however, the}} Kingston Trio's {{dominance}} in record sales and concert bookings began to wane, due partly to imitators in the pop-folk world {{and also to}} the rise of other commercial folk groups like Peter, Paul and Mary. The British Invasion spearheaded by The Beatles, who were signed by EMI/Capitol just as the Trio's seven-year contract was running out, depressed sales of acoustic folk albums significantly, and Capitol did not make a serious effort to re-sign the group. Werber secured a generous signing bonus from Decca Records, and the last four albums of the Kingston Trio's first decade were released by that label. Without the production facilities of Capitol, however, and the expertise of Voyle Gilmore and engineer Pete Abbott, the Decca releases lacked the aural <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Capitol albums, and none of the four sold especially well.|$|E
5|$|Numerous archaeological discoveries {{show that}} silk {{had become a}} luxury {{material}} appreciated in foreign countries well before {{the opening of the}} Silk Road by the Chinese. For example, silk has been found in the Valley of the Kings in a tomb of a mummy dating from 1070 BCE. First the Greeks, then the Romans began to speak about the Seres (people of silk), a term to designate the inhabitants of the far-off kingdom, China. According to certain historians, the first Roman contact with silk was that of the legions of the governor of Syria, Crassus. At the Battle of Carrhae, near to the Euphrates, the legions were said to be so surprised by the <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> banners of Parthia that they fled.|$|E

In particular the decoration features large areas of translucent red, which have survived in excellent condition. This colour, known as rouge clair, {{was the most difficult}} to achieve technically, and highly prized for this and the <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colour when it was done successfully. Scenes from the life of Saint Agnes run round the top of the cover and the sloping underside of the main body. The symbols of the Four Evangelists run round the foot of the cup, and there are enamel medallions at the centre of the inside of both the cup and the cover. The lower of the two added bands contains enamel Tudor roses on a diapered pointillé background; this was apparently added under HenryVIII. The upper band has an engraved inscription filled in with black enamel, with a barrier of laurel branches in green to mark off the end of the inscription from its beginning.|$|E

25|$|During {{his tenure}} at the RFC, Reed {{influenced}} two major national policies. First, Reed was instrumental in setting up the Commodity Credit Corporation. In early October 1933, President Roosevelt ordered RFC president Jesse Jones to establish a program to strengthen cotton prices. On October 16, 1933, Jones met with Reed and together they created the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6340 the next day, which legally established the CCC. The <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CCC was {{that the government would}} hold surplus cotton as security for the loan. If cotton prices rose above the value of the loan, farmers could redeem their cotton, pay off the loan and make a profit. If prices stayed low, the farmer still had enough money to live as well as plant next year. The plan worked so well that it became the basis for the New Deal's entire agricultural program.|$|E

25|$|The first {{brilliant}} {{cuts were}} introduced {{in the middle of}} the 17th century. Known as Mazarins, they had 17 facets on the crown (upper half). They are also called double-cut brilliants as they are seen as a step up from old single cuts. Vincent Peruzzi, a Venetian polisher, later increased the number of crown facets from 17 to 33 (triple-cut or Peruzzi brilliants), thereby significantly increasing the fire and <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cut gem, properties that in the Mazarin were already incomparably better than in the rose. Yet Peruzzi-cut diamonds, when seen nowadays, seem exceedingly dull compared to modern-cut brilliants. Because the practice of bruting had not yet been developed, these early brilliants were all rounded squares or rectangles in cross-section (rather than circular). Given the general name of cushion—what are known today as old mine cuts—these were common by the early 18th century. Sometime later the old European cut was developed, which had a shallower pavilion, more rounded shape, and different arrangement of facets. The old European cut was the forerunner of modern brilliants and was the most advanced in use during the 19th century.|$|E

The temple murals and some cholan and pandyan literature refer to this sthala puranam. The chidambaram mahatyam as well as koyil puranam by the same author discuss as to how this prince who was presented with dhataki or atti garland and tiger flag in which Lord Indra would take abode to make him ever victorious was blessed with vision of lord and further attained mukti at this spot. This is very credible because all ancient {{literature and}} documents report that tiger flag and atti or dhataki (grislea tomentosa) garland as being emblematic with cholas. Some sangam period works also passingly refer to the krita age king's war with demons and his victory against them. The king also went by name Vyaghraketu after being gifted with the tiger flag.|$|E

500|$|Light {{became a}} popular means for 15th-century Northern {{painters}} {{to represent the}} mystery of the Incarnation, utilising the idea of light passing through glass without shattering it to convey the paradox of conception and [...] "virgo intacta".

500|$|Light was {{associated}} with Mary and the Incarnation from the 9th century.

50|$|According to Latter Day Saint theology, all of {{material}} creation {{is filled with}} immanence, known as <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> Christ.

Alan Ross, writing in The Times Literary Supplement wrote that Casino Royale was [...] "an extremely engaging affair", and that [...] "the especial charm... is the high poetry with which he invests the green baize lagoons of the casino tables". He concluded that the book was [...] "both exciting and extremely civilized". Reviewing for The Listener, Simon Raven believed that Fleming was a [...] "kind of supersonic John Buchan", but he was somewhat dismissive of the plot, observing that it is [...] "a brilliant but improbable notion" [...] that includes [...] "a deal of champagne-drinking, bomb-throwing, relentless pitting of wits etc... with a cretinous love-affair".

500|$|Closely {{detailed}} {{beams of}} light spill {{through the high}} windows and illuminate the interior, filling the portal and flowing across the tiled floors before it hits the clerestory windows.

Shadows cast by the cathedral can be seen across the choir steps and near aisle. Their angle is rendered in an unusually realistic manner for early 15th century, and the detail is such that their description is likely based on observation of the actual behaviour of light, a further innovation in 15th-century art. Yet while the light is portrayed as it might appear in nature, its source is not. Panofsky notes that the sunlight enters from the north windows, but contemporary churches normally had east-facing choirs, so the light should enter from the south. He suggests the light {{is not intended to}} be natural, but rather to represent the divine, and hence subject to [...] "the laws of symbolism and not those of nature." ...|$|E
