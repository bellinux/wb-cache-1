25|$|The bishop {{said that}} he was not aware of her {{alarming}} health condition when he approved of the exorcism and did not testify. The accused were found guilty of manslaughter resulting from negligence and were sentenced to six months in jail (which was later suspended) and three years of probation. It was a far lighter sentence than anticipated, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> requested by the prosecution, who had asked that the priests only be fined and that the parents be found guilty but not punished. The Church approving such an old fashioned exorcism rite drew public and media attention. The case has been labelled as a misidentification of mental illness, negligence, abuse, and religious hysteria.|$|E

500|$|In {{the middle}} of the 2nd century, some of the largest domes were built near present-day Naples, as part of large bath {{complexes}} taking advantage of the volcanic hot springs in the area. At the bath complex at Baiae, there are remains of a collapsed dome spanning , called the [...] "Temple of Venus", and a larger half-collapsed dome spanning [...] called the [...] "Temple of Diana". The dome of the [...] "Temple of Diana", which may have been a nymphaeum as part of the bath complex, can be seen to have had an ogival section made of horizontal layers of mortared brick and capped with light tufa. It dates to {{the second half of the}} 2nd century and is the third largest dome known from the Roman world. The second largest is the collapsed [...] "Temple of Apollo" [...] built nearby along the shore of Lake Avernus. The span cannot be precisely measured due to its ruined state, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> [...] in diameter.|$|E
500|$|A {{spinster}} {{for many}} years, Mavis resisted the advances of men, often {{too shy to}} allow dating to progress beyond {{the initial stages of}} courtship. Ian Randall comments that [...] "Many a man has been smitten with Mavis Riley, but unfortunately she always seemed to attract the drippier of the male species". In 1976 a love interest was introduced for Mavis in the form of Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a decade before the couple finally married in 1988, after simultaneously jilting each other four years earlier. Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, said, [...] "She [...] was quite a tough little character. You know, a lot of girls would have gone through with , and she stuck to her guns and said 'No, no this isn't right.' Again, dithering and weepy, but she was tough enough to do it. That scene [...] is reflective of the two of them. That was the essence of the friendship, they stuck up for each other and [...] great friends, all the way through." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{leaflets}} {{were seen}} as being an effective tactic in manipulating troops when morale was low, [...] "During {{the early months of}} the war, leaflets or pamphlets were scattered over enemy territory by aircraft and balloons <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> doubtful whether these had any useful effect, their obvious defects being that few can have reached their targets and, being printed, they were sometimes out of date {{by the time they were}} ready to distribute. The front-line distribution of leaflets was quite another matter and these were dropped by aircraft or fired by shells, the messages they bore being less careful about the general principles of consistency and frankness and only truthful about matters on which the enemy had contradictory information". It was found that psychological warfare was not effective when distributing surrender leaflets to an enemy which currently had a high morale amongst its troops. Despite the pitfalls to airborne leaflets ineffectiveness on opposing sides with high morale, enemies used this tactic [...] "to cause the men to begin talking to each other about their poor military position, their desire to stay alive for their families' sakes, and the reasonableness of honorable surrender", which often led men to desert their troops.|$|E
2500|$|Financed by The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald, Morrison {{was sent}} on an {{exploration}} journey to New Guinea. He sailed from Cooktown, Queensland {{in a small}} lugger, arriving at Port Moresby after a stormy passage. On 24 July 1883 Morrison with a small party started {{with the intention of}} crossing to Dyke Acland Bay 100 miles (160km) away. Much high mountain country barred the way, and it took 38 days to cover 50 miles. The natives became hostile, and about a month later Morrison was struck by two spears and almost killed. Retracing their steps, with Morrison strapped to a horse, Port Moresby was reached in days. Here Morrison received medical attention <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a month before he reached the hospital at Cooktown. In spite of his misfortune Morrison had penetrated farther into New Guinea than any previous white man. Much the better for a week in hospital Morrison went on to Melbourne, but he still carried the head of a spear in his body and no local surgeon was anxious to probe for it in the condition of surgery in that day. His youngest sister, whose married name was Evelyn Hilda Gaunt (1877-1967), presented a miniature daily devotional book with an inscription [...] "Ernest with Hilda's love. Geelong College March 1884". She was the youngest sibling and was six years old when she gave the 22-year-old this book before he left Melbourne, for Edinburgh, on 27 March 1884.|$|E
