5|$|After moving ashore, <b>Beryl</b> quickly {{weakened}} to {{a tropical}} depression. It slowed {{due to the}} weakening ridge to its north, and an approaching cold front turned it {{to the north and}} northeast on May29. Despite being well inland, <b>Beryl</b> retained enough convection to remain a tropical cyclone. As <b>Beryl</b> approached the Atlantic Ocean on May30, its convection increased to the south and east of the center, although the intrusion of dry air resulted in a ragged appearance on satellite imagery. Based on reports from ships, <b>Beryl</b> was upgraded to a tropical storm on May30 near the South Carolina coastline. The approaching front caused the storm to accelerate northeastward. Beryl's circulation became elongated and its associated convection spread northward, suggesting the transition into an extratropical cyclone. By late on May30, <b>Beryl</b> became extratropical, prompting the NHC to discontinue advisories. The storm continued to the northeast, later turning to the east-southeast. On June2, a larger extratropical storm absorbed the remnants of <b>Beryl</b> to the southeast of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|Early in its duration, Tropical Storm <b>Beryl</b> {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} and gusty winds on the Cape Verde island of Sal. The storm caused moderate damage across the archipelago, totaling $3million (1982USD). The passage of <b>Beryl</b> resulted in three casualties in Brava Island, {{as well as}} 122 injuries. In the period after the storm's passage, the United States provided humanitarian aid and economic assistance to the country, helping the archipelago to reverse the effects of <b>Beryl.</b>|$|E

5|$|The mineral <b>beryl,</b> which {{contains}} beryllium, {{has been used}} {{at least since the}} Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. In the first century CE, Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder mentioned in his encyclopedia Natural History that <b>beryl</b> and emerald ("smaragdus") were similar. The Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis, written in the third or fourth century CE, contains notes on how to prepare artificial emerald and <b>beryl.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Beryl</b> was {{an unusual}} Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclone that formed over southeastern Louisiana in August 1988. The second tropical storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season, <b>Beryl</b> developed from a slow-moving trough of low pressure on August 8. It tracked southeastward into the coastal waters of eastern Louisiana, and <b>Beryl</b> reached peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) while located about 75miles (120km) southeast of New Orleans. The storm turned to the northwest over Louisiana and Texas, and slowly dissipated. The remnants of <b>Beryl</b> continued northward into the central United States, dropping some rainfall and providing relief to a severe heat wave.|$|E

5|$|<b>Beryl</b> {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about}} 18hours as it paralleled the Mid-Atlantic and New Jersey coasts, during which an eye-like feature {{developed in the}} center of the convection. Late on July 20, it began a slow weakening trend after passing over cooler waters. Steering winds ahead of an approaching mid-level trough caused <b>Beryl</b> to accelerate northeastward, and early on July 21 the center of the storm crossed the island of Nantucket. The convection diminished as it moved through progressively colder waters, and shortly after 1200UTC on July 21 <b>Beryl</b> became an extratropical cyclone a short distance east of Cape Cod. Hours later, it made landfall in southwestern Nova Scotia, and on July 22 the extratropical remnants of <b>Beryl</b> merged with an approaching cold front over Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beryl</b> {{produced}} rough seas {{along the}} northeast United States coastline. In Massachusetts, its impact {{was limited to}} light rainfall and gusty winds, with no reported damage. <b>Beryl</b> later produced moderate rainfall and gusty winds across Atlantic Canada, resulting in some localized power outages though little damage. No deaths were reported.|$|E

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{absorption spectra}} of Fe^(2 +) in non-chromium <b>beryls</b> are examined. Fe^(2 +) in the Al-rich six-coordinate site produces absorption bands at about 820 nm and 970 nm polarized EIIc. Fe^(2 +) in the channel produces bands at 820 nm (⊥c) and 2100 nm (IIc). Some blue <b>beryls</b> {{which are more}} intensely colored than most aquamarines, have an absorption band at ∼ 700 nm (‖c) which is suggested to arise from an Fe^(2 +) /Fe^(3 +) intervalence interaction. Fe^(2 +) in both the six-coordinate site and the channel is identified in the Mössbauer spectra. The Mössbauer spectra of deep blue <b>beryls</b> are unusual and have not been satisfactorily explained.

5|$|In August 1955 <b>Beryl</b> felt unwell {{and went}} for tests: she was {{diagnosed}} with cancer of the uterus and was given two years to live. The couple reacted to the news in different ways, and while <b>Beryl</b> began to drink heavily—up to a bottle of whisky a day to dull the pain—George began to work harder, and began a close friendship with a school teacher, Pat Howson.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} {{moved slowly}} to the north-northwest through {{a break in the}} subtropical ridge, and as convective banding features became more prominent the system intensified into Tropical Storm <b>Beryl.</b> Throughout much of its duration, the storm tracked through an environment with light vertical wind shear and well-established upper-level outflow. Shortly after becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation of <b>Beryl</b> became exposed with limited deep convection, though deep convection re-developed the following morning. Outflow continued to improve, and with warm sea surface temperatures <b>Beryl</b> gradually intensified to attain peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) early on July 20 while located about 120miles (190km) east of Nags Head, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to <b>Beryl</b> produced heavy rainfall in Cuba, causing flooding, mudslides and two deaths. Torrential rain also affected south Florida and the Bahamas. After forming, <b>Beryl</b> produced rough surf along the US southeastern coast, leaving one person from Folly Beach, South Carolina missing. Upon making landfall in Florida, the storm produced strong winds that left 38,000people without power. High rains alleviated drought conditions {{and put out}} wildfires along the storm's path. A fallen tree killed a man driving in Orangeburg County, South Carolina. In northeast North Carolina, <b>Beryl</b> spawned an EF1 tornado that snapped trees and damaged dozens of homes {{near the city of}} Peletier. Overall damage was minor, estimated at $148,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{warnings}} {{remained in}} effect for twelve hours, then they were discontinued north of Port Mansfield in Texas. The hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning in all areas between Port Mansfield southwards to Tampico. It was predicted the rains from <b>Beryl</b> could produce dangerous flash floods and mudslides over the mountainous areas of Mexico. When <b>Beryl</b> made landfall early on August 15, all warnings were discontinued in Texas. All warnings issued in the Government of Mexico were discontinued six hours later when <b>Beryl</b> was downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Beryl</b> caused {{flooding}} {{in several states}} in the Eastern United States in August1994. The second named storm and third tropical cyclone of the season, <b>Beryl</b> developed from an upper-level low pressure area over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on August14. Initially a tropical depression, the system intensified into a tropical storm about 24hours after forming. <b>Beryl</b> then moved slowly northeastward and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) before making landfall near Panama City, Florida, early on August16. Within 12hours of moving inland, the storm weakened to a tropical depression, but persisted as a tropical cyclone {{for a few days}} while traversing the Eastern United States. <b>Beryl</b> was absorbed by a frontal system while situated over Connecticut early on August19.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Beryl</b> made {{landfall}} {{just south}} of the United States–Mexico border in mid-August2000, causing minimal damage. The second named storm of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season, <b>Beryl</b> originated from a tropical wave near the African coastline. Tracking westward, the wave failed to organize substantially until entering the Bay of Campeche, at which time it developed into a tropical storm. <b>Beryl</b> rapidly deepened while in the Gulf of Mexico, and it initially was forecast to strengthen to a hurricane under favorable conditions for development. Instead, <b>Beryl</b> remained at moderate tropical storm intensity and failed to intensify any further. It made landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas as a weak tropical storm with winds of 50mph (85km/h) on August15 and dissipated over mountainous terrain shortly thereafter. One death was reported in Mexico due to drowning. Otherwise, no significant damage was reported associated with <b>Beryl,</b> as it affected a sparsely populated area of Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Beryl</b> was a weak system, {{and unlike}} Alberto, its rapid motion up the Eastern Seaboard spread its heavy {{rainfall}} across a large area. <b>Beryl</b> caused inland flooding {{as it moved}} through Georgia, across the Carolinas, {{and all the way}} to Connecticut. Property damage reached at least $74.22 million, with $40 million in damage in South Carolina, $15 million in Virginia, $12 million in New York, $5.9 million in Florida, and at least $1.32 million in Georgia. Five deaths were reported, while {{a large number of people}} ndash& 37 in Lexington County, South Carolina, alone ndash& were injured by the tornadoes <b>Beryl</b> produced as it weakened.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Beryl</b> made {{landfall}} in Jacksonville Beach, Florida with , {{it became}} the strongest tropical cyclone at landfall in the U.S. outside of the official Atlantic hurricane season. <b>Beryl</b> was also the second tropical storm to form {{before the start of}} the season, which marked only the fifth such occurrence since records began in 1851; the other four occurrences were in 1887, 1908, 1951 and 2016.|$|E
