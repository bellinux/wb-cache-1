5|$|In 1981, Sharman {{reunited with}} O'Brien to do Shock Treatment, a {{stand-alone}} feature {{that was not}} a direct sequel to the original film. This film reunites characters Brad and Janet and was originally conceived and written to depict the characters filmed in normal settings until the production changed to work around a Screen Actor's Guild strike. The eventual production would now entail the full film being shot entirely within a sound stage and purposely blending that into the story line. Shock Treatment has a cult following <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> strong as the first film, and was a commercial failure in no small part due to the principal cast of Curry, Sarandon and Bostwick not returning.|$|E
25|$|With Jochen Rindt signing for Lotus for 1969, Oliver was out, {{switching}} to BRM. He was to suffer disappointing {{two years at}} the Bourne team, which would effectively kill off his Grand Prix career. In two years, he would muster just four finishes, with his only points scores being 6th place in the 1969 Mexican Grand Prix, and 5th in the 1970 Austrian Grand Prix. However, in 1970 he led much of the Race of Champions holding off Stewart and was a strong third {{for most of the}} Dutch and British GP. The poor result in the Austrian GP which Team boss, Lou Stanley thought he should have won, saw the best car go to Rodriquez from then on, but Oliver still led some laps at the slipstream Italian race. Stanley described Oliver, as 'good, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> good as he thought'. The majority of his other races saw the BRM break down. Most pundits and sponsor, Yardley, were surprised and disappointed after Oliver was sacked by BRM. Jackie Stewart, judged Oliver a very good GP and Can Am driver.|$|E

There were figures of up to $1.5 million for demolition." [...] At the time of {{the building}}'s collapse, the Spiegel brothers vowed that it would be re-built, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> large: [...] "perhaps 20 feet high by 60 feet deep by 75 feet wide, which would cost about $2 million to $3 million".|$|E

500|$|The Okeechobee hurricane, {{also known}} as the San Felipe Segundo hurricane, was one of the deadliest hurricanes in the {{recorded}} history of the North Atlantic basin. The fourth tropical cyclone, third hurricane, and only major hurricane of the 1928 season, this system developed just offshore the west coast of Africa on September6. Initially a tropical depression, it strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, shortly before passing south of the Cape Verde Islands. Further intensification was slow and halted by late on September7. About 48hours later, the storm resumed strengthening and became a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane wind scale. Still moving westward, the system reached Category4 intensity before striking Guadeloupe on September12. There, the storm brought [...] "great destruction" [...] and 1,200deaths. The islands of Martinique, Montserrat, and Nevis also reported damage and fatalities, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> severe as in Guadeloupe.|$|E

Brian quickly becomes obsessed with Brooke and leaves several messages on her answering machine, even though she never gets back to him. Brooke gets angry at Brian for stalking her and throws her telephone at him when he attempts to serenade her outside her apartment. Brian is upset that he became the very thing he was mocking in the beginning.|$|E
500|$|More {{complete}} {{material is}} available for the two Megalomys species known to have survived into historic times, M.desmarestii and M.luciae. M.desmarestii is about as large as [...] "Ekbletomys" [...] and M.luciae is slightly smaller.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. IGN contributor Robert Canning {{felt that}} the episode [...] "didn't have the same comedic appeal" [...] as [...] "Klaus and Greta", but did say there were [...] "some funny moments to be sure", but overall the episode lacked. He commented that the main plot had its faults, but that the weak link in the story was Cheyenne Jackson's Danny. He wrote that the Sue character had been great in the past, but that her [...] "expanded role" [...] in this episode was less successful. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating. The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff wrote that [...] "Black Light Attack!" [...] was [...] "dead in spots. I mean, I laughed out loud a number of times, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> much". He noted he liked Liz and Jack battling over Danny, but [...] "something about it never landed {{in the way it}} should have", and opined that the show {{did not know what to}} do with Jackson. Overall, he gave the episode a B rating. Sean Gandert for Paste {{felt that the}} Liz, Jack, and Danny plot was less interesting [...] "and in general pretty meh." [...] He noted that [...] "Black Light Attack!" [...] was [...] "a big let-down" [...] after the airing of [...] "Klaus and Greta". Leonard Pierce for The A.V. Club called the episode uneven.|$|E
500|$|A 1985 {{review in}} the book The Motion Picture Guide said, [...] "The film tries to balance horror against {{morality}} but ends up shaky at best". The review described the special effects as [...] "all right, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> gruesome as the film pretends they are". In a review written shortly after the film was released, Variety wrote that the film [...] "more often than not succeeds in telling a story and sustaining audience interest," [...] and that the script included not only horrors, but also a human story with a moral message about society. However, the review also called the dialogue [...] "trite," [...] described some scenes as [...] "technically incorrect," [...] and said the film disappointed by lingering on the ordinary characters {{rather than on the}} monster. Gene Wright, who wrote a book about science fiction films, said the film [...] "attempts to blend pathos with awesome horror, but can't resist going for the gut with a surfeit of gore". Blockbuster Inc.'s Guide to Movies and Videos gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, and described the it as [...] "unexciting and contrived, though Rick Baker's gross-out makeup is undeniably effective". In The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction Movies, Phil Hardy described it as a better-than-average but [...] "spotty" [...] film, and said director William Sachs injected a sense of [...] "grisly humor" [...] into it. However, Hardy said the central concept inspired more laughter than terror, and called the special effects [...] "only routine".|$|E
500|$|Reviews were mixed, and {{the camp}} tone had a mostly {{negative}} reaction. The film currently has a 67% [...] "fresh" [...] rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Connery was applauded by Kevin A. Ranson of MovieCrypt and Michael A. Smith of Nolan's Pop Culture. Critic Roger Ebert noted, {{in a positive}} review, the irrelevance of the plot and [...] "moments of silliness", such as Bond finding himself driving a moon buggy with antennae revolving and robot arms flapping. He praised the Las Vegas car chase scene, particularly the segment when Bond drives the Mustang on two wheels. Twenty-five years after its release, James Berardinelli criticised {{the concept of a}} laser-shooting satellite and the performances of Jill St. John, Norman Burton and Jimmy Dean. Christopher Null called St. John [...] "one of the least effective Bond girls â€“ beautiful, but shrill and helpless". Steve Rhodes said, [...] "looking and acting like a couple of pseudo-country bumpkins, they (Putter Smith and Bruce Glover) seem to have wandered by accident from the adjoining sound stage into the filming of this movie." [...] But he also extolled the car chase as [...] "classic". According to Danny Peary, Diamonds are Forever is [...] "one of the most forgettable movies of the entire Bond series" [...] and that [...] "until Blofeld's reappearance we must watch what is no better than a mundane diamond-smuggling melodrama, without the spectacle we associate with James Bond: the Las Vegas setting isn't exotic enough, there's little humour, assassins Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint are similar to characters you'd find on The Avengers, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> amusing â€“ and the trouble Bond gets into, even Maxwell Smart could escape." [...] IGN chose it as the third worst James Bond film, behind only The Man with the Golden Gun and Die Another Day. Total Film listed Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, and Bambi and Thumper, as the first and second worst villains in the Bond series (respectively). The film was more positively received by Xan Brooks of the Guardian, who said it was [...] "oddly brilliant, the best of the bunch: the perfect bleary Bond film for an imperfect bleary western world." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the island}} of St. Thomas, the damage was bad <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> extensive. [...] Television station WBNB-TV channel 10 (the local CBS affiliate) had its {{transmitter}} completely destroyed by Hurricane Hugo. [...] The station would {{not return to the}} air, because of the damages, and the owners' inability to afford repairs. Many business were destroyed. West Indies Transport had operated several businesses in Krum Bay, St. Thomas, including a dry dock, a ship repair facility, and a barge towing company. In UNITED STATES v. WEST INDIES TRANSPORT INC 96 7063 WIT 96 7064 96 7065 it was written that [...] "Hurricane Hugo seriously damaged some of the barges, shifting them from their permitted positions. West Indies Transport did not attempt to repair, reposition, or salvage these barges after the storm. Instead, it used these barges as docks, repair facilities, and housing for employees in their new unauthorized locations."

2500|$|Both {{throughout}} Bonin's {{trials and}} in the years prior to his execution, much speculation was given {{as to whether the}} root cause of Bonin's crimes lay in his abusive, dysfunctional upbringing. Opponents and advocates of the death penalty alike were in agreement Bonin had endured extensive physical and sexual abuse in his childhood, but much scorn was given to the claims from Bonin's attorneys and supporters that the murders had been a direct manifestation of the abuse he had endured as a child and adolescent, and an attempt to purge his frustration and anger onto his victims. In one article published in the San Francisco Chronicle three days prior to Bonin's execution, an editor named Robert Morse opined: [...] "Bonin was abused as a child. The abuse seems to have been bad, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> gruesome as the abuse he dealt out. [...] world is filled with articulate people who can write and paint and were abused as children; very few of them become serial killers. The crime rate among the mentally ill is lower than among so-called 'normal' people. To call Bonin's evil a psychiatric disorder, as the defense has, or an illness, is to slander the mentally ill." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Sound of Music film, {{like the}} stage musical, {{presents}} {{a history of}} the von Trapp family that is not completely accurate. The filmmakers used artistic license to convey the essence and meaning of their story. Georg Ludwig von Trapp was indeed an anti-Nazi opposed to the Anschluss, and lived with his family in a villa in a district of Salzburg called Aigen. Their lifestyle depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living. The actual family villa, located at TraunstraÃŸe 34, Aigen 5026, was large and comfortable <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> grand as the mansion depicted in the film. The house was also not their ancestral home, as depicted in the film. The family had previously lived in homes in Zell Am See and Klosterneuburg after being forced to abandon their actual ancestral home in Pola following World War I. Georg moved the family to the Salzburg villa shortly {{after the death of his}} first wife in 1922. In the film, Georg is referred to as [...] "Baron", but his actual family title was [...] "Ritter" [...] (German for [...] "knight"), a hereditary knighthood the equivalent of which in the United Kingdom is a baronetcy. Austrian nobility, moreover, was legally abolished in 1919 and the nobiliary particle von was proscribed after World War I, so he was legally [...] "Georg Trapp". Both the title and the prepositional nobiliary particle von, however, continued to be widely used unofficially as a matter of courtesy.|$|E
