50|$|The {{addition}} of glycerol {{results in an}} exothermic reaction (i.e., heat is produced), as usual for mixed-acid nitrations. If the mixture becomes too hot, it results in a runaway reaction, a state of accelerated nitration accompanied by the destructive oxidation of organic materials by the hot nitric acid {{and the release of}} poisonous nitrogen dioxide gas at high risk of an explosion. Thus, the glycerin mixture is added slowly to the reaction vessel containing the mixed acid (not acid to glycerin). The nitrator is cooled with cold water or some other coolant mixture and maintained throughout the glycerin addition at about 22 C, much below which the esterification occurs too slowly to be useful. The nitrator vessel, often constructed of iron or lead and generally stirred with compressed air, has an emergency trap door at its base, which hangs over a large pool of very cold water and into which the whole reaction mixture (called the charge) can be dumped to prevent an explosion, a process referred to as drowning. If the temperature of the charge exceeds about 30 C (actual value varying by country) or <b>brown</b> <b>fumes</b> are seen in the nitrator's vent, then it is immediately drowned.|$|E
30|$|Each sample (0.1  g) was weighed into a 100  ml conical flask, and digested using US EPA method 3050 B as {{described}} below (United States, Environmental Protection Agency 1996). Each sample was mixed thoroughly to achieve homogeneity and sieved using a USS # 10 sieve. All equipment used for homogenization was cleaned thoroughly {{to minimize the}} potential cross-contamination. For each digestion procedure, a sample was weighed to the nearest 0.01  g and a 0.1  g sample (dry weight) was transferred to a digestion vessel. Concentrated HNO 3 (10  ml) was added into it. The sample was heated to 95 [*]±[*] 5 °C and refluxed for 10 to 15  minutes without boiling. The sample was allowed to cool, and then 5  ml of Concentrated HNO 3 was added and refluxed for 30  minutes. If <b>brown</b> <b>fumes</b> were generated, indicating oxidation of the sample by HNO 3, this step was repeated (addition of 5  ml of conc. HNO 3) over and over until no <b>brown</b> <b>fumes</b> were given off by the sample indicating the complete reaction with HNO 3. The solution was allowed to evaporate to approximately 5  ml without boiling and heated at 95 [*]±[*] 5 °C for two hours. The sample was cooled to room temperature and 2  ml of water and 3  ml of 30 % H 2 O 2 were added. The vessel {{was covered with a}} watch glass (care was taken to ensure that losses did not occur due to excessively vigorous effervescence). The sample was heated until effervescence subsides and the vessel was cooled. The adding of 30 % H 2 O 2 in 1  ml aliquots with warming was continued until the effervescence was minimal. The reaction mixture was poured into a 100  ml volumetric flask and diluted to 100  ml. Each fertilizer was digested in duplicates. Spiked samples (10  μg/L) in duplicates were also digested to confirm the methodology. The same procedure repeated without the fertilizer was considered as the control.|$|E
30|$|The {{second part}} {{was devoted to}} the HCrO 4 − {{reduction}} under visible light on the hetero-system CoZn 2 O 4 /TiO 2. The spinel ZnCo 2 O 4 was prepared by co-precipitation; stoichiometric amounts of Co(NO 3) 2 · 5 H 2 O (purity 99 %, Merck) and Zn(NO 3) 2 · 6 H 2 O (99 %, Prolabo) were dissolved in distilled water. The solution was evaporated on a hot plate and heated at 150  °C for the nitrate decomposition until disappearance of <b>brown</b> NOx <b>fumes.</b> Then, the powder was ground in an agate mortar and reheated in a programmed furnace at 650  °C (10  °C min− 1, 16  h) with three intermediate regrindings. TiO 2 (99 %) was supplied by Merck company. The phases were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Mini-Diffractometer MD- 10 using Cu Kα anticathode (λ[*]=[*] 0.15418  nm).|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the feasibility of decreasing NO{sub x} emissions from the current uranium alloy scrap tray dissolving facility. In the current process, uranium scrap is dissolved in boiling nitric acid in shallow stainless-steel trays. As scrap dissolves, more metal and more nitric acid are added to the tray by operating personnel. Safe geometry is assured by keeping liquid level at or below 5 cm, the depth of a safe infinite slab. The accountability batch control system provides additional protection against criticality. The trays are steam coil heated. The process has operated satisfactorily, with few difficulties, for decades. Both uranium and uranium alloys are dissolved. Nitric acid is recovered from the vapors for reuse. Metal nitrates are sent to uranium recovery. <b>Brown</b> NO{sub x} <b>fumes</b> evolved during dissolving have occasionally resulted in a visible plume from the trays. The fuming is most noticeable during startup and after addition of fresh acid to a tray. Present environmental regulations are expected to require control of brown NO{sub x} emissions. Because NO{sub x} is hazardous, fumes should be suppressed whenever the electric blower system is inoperable. Because the tray dissolving process has worked well for decades, as much of the current capital equipment and operating procedures as possible were preserved. A detailed review of the literature, indicated the feasibility of slightly altering process chemistry to favor the production of NO{sub 2 }, which can be scrubbed and recycled as nitric acid. Methods for controlling the process to manage offgas product distribution and to minimize chemical reaction hazards were also considered...|$|R
30|$|A 2 -cm 2 {{sheet of}} a {{developed}} film (0.0504  g) was cut into several strips {{and put into}} a 100 -mL beaker. Then, 0.5  mL of concentrated sulfuric acid was added, followed by six to eight drops of concentrated nitric acid. The beaker {{was placed on the}} hot plate and heated until evolution of <b>brown</b> <b>fumes</b> was no longer observed. This procedure was repeated until the radiological film was digested. After complete decomposition, the contents of the beaker should consist of a white to very light tan precipitate and a clear yellowish liquid. The hot plate was set on high heat, and the contents of the beaker were boiled until white fumes appeared (Gansel 1959; Sarafraz-Yazdi and Amiri 2010). Then, the analysis was performed as mentioned previously after diluting the solution 50 times and adjusting the pH with sodium hydroxide to pH 2.|$|E

3000|$|Further, the {{construction}} triazole ring on 15 to provide 16 comprises diazotization reaction followed by cyclization. The reported reactions for diazotization (NaNO 2 -acetic acid) involve highly acidic {{conditions that are}} found to be not suitable as it leads to deprotection compound 15 and formation of other unknown impurities which are difficult to remove. The alternative diazotizing agents such as alkyl nitrite (isoamyl nitrite in bromoform) is not suitable for diazotization on an industrial scale, since they are expensive, decompose during storage, corrosive and requires exclusively organic medium (ether, acetonitrile, THF, etc.,). Diazonium salts obtained under classical conditions are potentially explosive substances and thus need a very safer mechanism to handle in the plant scale. Diazotization using cation exchange resin along with mild acidic reagent such as P-toluene sulphonicacid (TsOH) with sodium nitrite in acetonitrile and water mixture releases <b>brown</b> <b>fumes</b> of gaseous nitrogen oxide which is again not safe in the production environment (Filimonov et al. 2008; Gorlushko et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2010; Moon et al. 2010). While exploring safer means of conducting this reaction, we have identified and introduced the anion exchange resin (Resin NO 2 [...]...|$|E
40|$|During {{the casting}} of {{ferromanganese}} alloys from electric arc furnaces into sand beds at temperatures {{of up to}} 1800 °C {{a considerable amount of}} very <b>brown</b> <b>fumes</b> are generated when the alloy fume is oxidized in the atmosphere. The fume is difficult to capture because of the large flux of gas that is generated. Possible reasons for this flux include the high evaporation rate of Mn at elevated temperatures, the large surface area of the casting beds and the large thermal plumes over the furnace tapholes and casting beds. It has been found that the use of fine water sprays {{along the edge of the}} roof that covers the casting bed resulted in a significant reduction in visible emissions. This paper describes research into the kinetics of the fume to improve the design of the capture hoods, as well as the mechanism of suppression by the water sprays by using CFD analysis. It is shown that the oxidation reaction produces less than 20 % of the energy content of the plume over the arc furnace taphole, and also that radiation heat transfer may play an important role in increasing the energy content of the taphole plume. The capture of fume particles by fine spray droplets is shown to have limited efficiency, while the heat sink that is caused by evaporation does not materially contribute to the circulation of fume through the spray. It is postulated that the increased moisture content of the air over the casting beds may be instrumental in reducing the oxygen partial pressure or in the formation of an oxide layer, both of which would reduce metal evaporation and, therefore fume formation. The exact mechanism requires further investigation. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{bioaccumulation}} of heavy metals from Synodontis clarias (S. clarias) and Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus (C. nigrodigitatus) with their parasitic fauna. Methods: A total of 50 specimens of each fish species (n = 100) were examined. The fishes {{were subjected to}} parasitological investigation while 3 g of intestinal tissue of S. clarias and C. nigrodigitatus samples were digested with nitric acid (10 mL). The tissues were then heated until <b>brown</b> <b>fumes</b> disappeared. The samples were allowed to cool and distilled water was added to make up to 50 mL in a standard flask. The filtrate was examined using the atomic absorption spectrometer. The fish hosts were weighed and measured {{with the aid of}} digital weighing balance and measuring board, respectively. Results: The Chi-square distribution was significant at 0. 01 level (χ 2 = 2. 16, P Zn > Mn > Fe > Cd (not detected) and Mn > Zn > Fe > Pb > Cd (not detected), respectively, while in the nematode, Procamallanus spp. and trematode, Siphodera spp. were Pb > Mn > Fe > Zn > Cd and Mn > Fe > Zn > Pb > Cd, respectively. In the water and sediment, the distribution of heavy metals were Fe > Mn > Zn > Pb > Cd and Fe > Mn > Pb > Zn > Cd, respectively. Conclusions: The findings of the concentrations of the trace elements in the aquatic habitat as well as the sediment were below the permissible limit of Federal Ministry of Environment. These findings confirmed that the aquatic habitat was adequate for fishing activity and that the consumption of fish species therein are safe. However, {{it should be noted that}} there was bioaccumulation of trace elements in the fish tissues which should not pose any danger to man. Therefore, a regular monitoring of the levels of trace elements in the water body as well as in the fauna should be regularly undertaken...|$|E
