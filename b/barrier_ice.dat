There is, however, apparently no definite evidence that the original Framheim hut was rediscovered, possibly because it was deeply buried.

40|$|Extracellular ice {{nucleation}} usually {{occurs at}} mild subzero temperatures in most plants. For persistent supercooling of certain plant parts <b>ice</b> <b>barriers</b> {{are necessary to}} prevent the entry of ice from already frozen tissues. The reproductive shoot of Calluna vulgaris is able to supercool down to below - 22 °C throughout all developmental stages (shoot elongation, flowering, fruiting) despite an established xylem conductivity. After localization of the persistent <b>ice</b> <b>barrier</b> between the reproductive and vegetative shoot {{at the base of}} the pedicel by infrared differential thermal analysis, the currently unknown structural features of the <b>ice</b> <b>barrier</b> tissue were anatomically analyzed on cross and longitudinal sections. The <b>ice</b> <b>barrier</b> tissue was recognized as a 250 μm long constriction zone {{at the base of the}} pedicel that lacked pith tissue and intercellular spaces. Most cell walls in this region were thickened and contained hydrophobic substances (lignin, suberin, and cutin). A few cell walls had what appeared to be thicker cellulose inclusions. In the <b>ice</b> <b>barrier</b> tissue, the area of the xylem was as much as 5. 7 times smaller than in vegetative shoots and consisted of tracheids only. The mean number of conducting units in the xylem per cross section was reduced to 3. 5 % of that in vegetative shoots. Diameter of conducting units and tracheid length were 70 % and 60 % (respectively) of that in vegetative shoots. From vegetative shoots water transport into the <b>ice</b> <b>barrier</b> must pass pit membranes that are likely impermeable to ice. Pit apertures were about 1. 9 μm x 0. 7 μm, which was significantly smaller than in the vegetative shoot. The peculiar anatomical features of the xylem at the base of the pedicel suggest that the diameter of pores in pit membranes could be the critical constriction for ice propagation into the persistently supercooled reproductive shoots of C. vulgaris...|$|R

The extinct volcano Mount Terror, also named during the Ross expedition, rises sharply from the Cape to a height of 3230 m, and {{the edge of the}} Ross Ice Shelf (formerly known as the <b>Barrier</b> or Great <b>Ice</b> <b>Barrier)</b> stretches away to its east.|$|R
40|$|AbstractOver-wintering {{reproductive}} buds of many {{woody plants}} survive frost by supercooling. The bud tissues are isolated from acropetally advancing ice {{by the presence}} of <b>ice</b> <b>barriers</b> that restrict <b>ice</b> growth. Plants living in alpine environments also face the risk of ice formation in summer months. Little knowledge exists, how reproductive structures of woody alpine plants are protected from frost injury during episodic summer frosts. In order to address this question, frost resistance of three common dwarf shrubs, Calluna vulgaris, Empetrum hermaphroditum and Loiseleuria procumbens was measured and ice formation and propagation were monitored in twigs bearing reproductive shoots during various stages of reproductive development (bud, anthesis, and fruit) throughout the alpine summer. Results indicated that, in the investigated species, <b>ice</b> <b>barriers</b> were present at all reproductive stages, isolating the reproductive shoots from ice advancing from the subtending vegetative shoot. Additionally, in the reproductive stems ice nucleating agents that are active at warm, sub-zero temperatures, were absent. The <b>ice</b> <b>barriers</b> were 100 % effective, with the exception of L. procumbens, where in 13 % of the total observations, the <b>ice</b> <b>barrier</b> failed. The <b>ice</b> <b>barriers</b> were localized {{at the base of the}} pedicel, at the anatomical junction of the vegetative and reproductive shoot. There, structural aspects of the tissue impede or prevent ice from advancing from the frozen stem into the pedicel of the reproductive shoot. Under the experimental conditions used in this study, ice nucleation initially occurred in the stem of the vegetative shoot at species-specific mean temperatures in the range of − 4. 7 to − 5. 8 °C. Reproductive shoots, however, remained supercooled and ice free down to a range of − 7. 2 to − 18. 2 °C or even below − 22 °C, the lowest temperature applied in the study. This level of supercooling is sufficient to prevent freezing of reproductive structures at the lowest air temperature occurring at the altitude of the upper distribution boundary of the natural habitat of the investigated species which is between − 8 and − 10 °C in summer. Frost resistance assays indicated that reproductive shoots are much less frost resistant than vegetative stems, and in contrast to vegetative shoots, are not ice tolerant. Supercooling of reproductive shoots in alpine, woody plant species is an effective mechanism that protects developing offspring from potential frost damage resulting from episodic summer freezing events...|$|R
