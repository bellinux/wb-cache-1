5|$|The {{film was}} a {{financial}} failure; according to Wild Bunch in February 2011, the film had returned 1.25% of the investment. In France, it was launched on 30 prints and sold 51,126 tickets in total.

Damilano, who set a games record, won the men's 20 kilometres walk title at that year's world championships, while men's steeplechase winner Azzedine Brahmi became a world bronze medallist in his event. <b>Brahim</b> Boutayeb, the reigning Olympic {{champion in the}} 10,000 metres, took the world 5000 metres bronze after his games record performance in Athens.|$|E
25|$|Nuttall's first senior {{international}} appearance {{came at the}} 1991 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, {{where he}} helped the English team to sixth. After a 3000m win at the UK Championships in Athletics in 1993, his first senior national title, he competed at the 1993 World Championships in Athletics, though he was eliminated in the heats. His most successful year came in 1994. He was Britain's top performer at the 1994 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in 32nd place then claimed fifth place in the 5000m at the 1994 European Athletics Championships. He took his first major medals over the 5000m, being the silver medallist at the 1994 IAAF World Cup (behind <b>Brahim</b> Lahlafi) and a bronze medallist at the 1994 Commonwealth Games.

25|$|The Polisario Front {{is led by}} a Secretary General. The first Secretary General was <b>Brahim</b> Gali, {{replaced}} in 1974 by El-Ouali at the II Congress of the Polisario Front, followed by Mahfoud Ali Beiba as Interim Secretary General upon his death. In 1976, Mohamed Abdelaziz was elected at the III Congress of the Polisario, and has held the post ever since. The Secretary General is elected by the General Popular Congress (GPC), regularly convened every four years. The GPC is composed of delegates from the Popular Congresses of the refugee camps in Tindouf, which are held biannually in each camp, and of delegates from the women's organization (UNMS), youth organization (UJSARIO), workers' organization (UGTSARIO) and military delegates from the SPLA (see below). All residents of the camps have {{a vote in the}} Popular Congresses, and participate in the administrative work in the camp through base-level 11-person cells, which form the smallest unit of the refugee camp political structure. These typically care for distribution of food, water and schooling in their area, joining in higher-level organs (encompassing several camp quarters) to cooperate and establish distribution chains. There is no formal membership of Polisario; instead, anyone who participates in its work or lives in the refugee camps is considered a member.|$|E
500|$|As {{in other}} Sahelian countries, {{literature}} in Chad has seen an economic, political and spiritual drought that has affected its best known writers. Chadian authors {{have been forced}} to write from exile or expatriate status and have generated literature dominated by themes of political oppression and historical discourse. Since 1962, 20 Chadian authors have written some 60 works of fiction. Among the most internationally renowned writers are Joseph <b>Brahim</b> Seïd, Baba Moustapha, Antoine Bangui and Koulsy Lamko. In 2003 Chad's sole literary critic, Ahmat Taboye, published his [...] to further knowledge of Chad's literature internationally and among youth and to make up for Chad's lack of publishing houses and promotional structure.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] {{talks about}} a scorned lover rediscovering their inner strength, with Madonna [...] "shooting a few poison arrows {{into the heart of}} some dude who's done her wrong," [...] as noted by Rolling Stone Rob Sheffield. During the song, she {{repeatedly}} labels an ex's bad behavior as [...] "bullshit" [...] and tells him, [...] "fuck you". In another part, she mocks, [...] "When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied." [...] In the chorus, she sings: [...] "It might sound like I’m an unapologetic bitch / but sometimes you know I gotta call I like it is." [...] The song was allegedly written about Madonna's ex-boyfriend <b>Brahim</b> Zaibat. She told Rolling Stone that the song [...] "it's like, fuck you, I'm going to have fun. You think you're going to ruin my life and you think that it's over for me, but guess what? It's not. Life goes on."

500|$|A {{writer for}} Rolling Stone noticed how Madonna's fans also make an {{appearance}} in the [...] "simple" [...] video. Brennan Carly from Billboard wrote that Madonna seemed [...] "down-to-earth and affable" [...] in the video. Bradley Stern from MuuMuse called the video as La Dolce Vita [...] "through Instagram filters" [...] and found elements of the music video for Madonna's 1998 single, [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love", with the paparazzi shots. He declared the scenes showing Madonna's then-boyfriend <b>Brahim</b> Zaibat, the singer's cleavage and booty slaps as highlights of the video. Stern concluded by saying that he [...] "thought this would be much worse because the concept is so flimsy, but I have to say: It's kind of a treat to see Madonna letting loose and having some fun." [...] Belinda White from The Daily Telegraph wrote that Madonna refused to act [...] "her age" [...] in the video but [...] "she has us {{more than a little}} envious of all the fun she's having, not to mention how incredible she looks." [...] Leslie Price from Pop Dust website found Madonna's getup as similar to actress Brigitte Bardot.|$|E
500|$|Crowley and Hirsig went to Tunis, where, {{dogged by}} {{continuing}} poor health, he unsuccessfully tried again {{to give up}} heroin, and began writing what he termed his [...] "autohagiography", The Confessions of Aleister Crowley. They were joined in Tunis by the Thelemite Norman Mudd, who became Crowley's public relations consultant. Employing a local boy, Mohammad ben <b>Brahim,</b> as his servant, Crowley went {{with him on a}} retreat to Nefta, where they performed sex magic together. In January 1924, Crowley travelled to Nice, France, where he met with Frank Harris, underwent a series of nasal operations, and visited the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man and had a positive opinion of its founder, George Gurdjieff. Destitute, he took on a wealthy student, Alexander Zu Zolar, before taking on another American follower, Dorothy Olsen. Crowley took Olsen back to Tunisia for a magical retreat in Nefta, where he also wrote To Man (1924), a declaration of his own status as a prophet entrusted with bringing Thelema to humanity. After spending the winter in Paris, in early 1925 Crowley and Olsen returned to Tunis, where he wrote The Heart of the Master (1938) as an account of a vision he experienced in a trance. In March Olsen became pregnant, and Hirsig was called to take care of her; she miscarried, following which Crowley took Olsen back to France. Hirsig later distanced herself from Crowley, who then denounced her.|$|E

2500|$|Founded in , Afek Tounes (Tunisian Horizons) is a centre-right {{political}} party in Tunisia. Its program is liberal, focusing on secularism and civil liberties.

2500|$|The {{danger of}} drought is ever present and still {{dramatically}} affects the Moroccan economy, even though Moroccan decisionmakers have recently {{stated that the}} economy becomes more diversified and deconnected from rain falls. Especially, cereal yields still depend on considerable variation in annual precipitation. Cereals constitute the essential of the agricultural value added and their production is very sensitive to rain falls. More important is that cereal yields determine not only the aggregate value added in the agricultural sector but also economic growth in general. According to the Moroccan economist, <b>Brahim</b> MANSOURI (Fiscal Policy and Economic Growth: Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia Compared, UNECA, 2008), when drought, measured as a dummy variable computed {{on the basis of}} the rate of growth of cereal yield, endangers extremely, the growth rate of real GDP would fall by 10 percent (see also, Mansouri's articles in [...]|$|E

6000|$|I {{shall not}} dilate further on this subject; because it will, (if God grant health and permission), be treated of {{at large and}} {{systematically}} in a work, which I have many years been preparing, on the Productive Logos human and divine; with, and as the introduction to, a full commentary on the Gospel of St. John. To make myself intelligible {{as far as my}} present subject requires, it will be sufficient briefly to observe.--1. That all association demands and presupposes the existence of the thoughts and images to be associated.--2. That the hypothesis of an external world exactly correspondent to those images or modifications of our own being, which alone, according to this system, we actually behold, is as thorough idealism as Berkeley's, inasmuch as it equally, perhaps in a more perfect degree, removes all reality and immediateness of perception, and places us in a dream-world of phantoms and spectres, the inexplicable swarm and equivocal generation of motions in our own brains.--3. That this hypothesis neither involves the explanation, nor precludes the necessity, of a mechanism and co-adequate forces in the percipient, which at the more than magic touch of the impulse from without is to create anew for itself the correspondent object. The formation of a copy is not solved by the mere pre-existence of an original; the copyist of Raffael's Transfiguration must repeat more or less perfectly the process of Raffael. It would be easy to explain a thought from the image on the retina, and that from the geometry of light, if this very light did not present the very same difficulty. We might as rationally chant the <b>Brahim</b> creed of the tortoise that supported the bear, that supported the elephant, that supported the world, to the tune of [...] "This is the house that Jack built." [...] The sic Deo placitum est we all admit as the sufficient cause, and the divine goodness as the sufficient reason; but an answer to the Whence and Why is no answer to the How, which alone is the physiologist's concern. It is a sophisma pigrum, and (as Bacon hath said) the arrogance of pusillanimity, which lifts up the idol of a mortal's fancy and commands us to fall down and worship it, as a work of divine wisdom, an ancile or palladium fallen from heaven. By the very same argument the supporters of the Ptolemaic system might have rebuffed the Newtonian, and pointing to the sky with self-complacent grin [26] have appealed to common sense, whether the sun did not move and the earth stand still.|$|E
