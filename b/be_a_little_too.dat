500|$|Still Alice {{is based}} on a novel of the same name {{published}} in 2007. The novel was written by Lisa Genova, a neuroscientist who was inspired by her grandmother's development of Alzheimer's disease to write about the disease from a firsthand perspective. British film producers Lex Lutzus and James Brown bought the rights to a film adaptation of the novel and pitched the project to their friends, filmmaking partners and married couple Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, in 2011. Glatzer and Westmoreland were initially hesitant to write and direct the film because Glatzer had just been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); they thought that writing about Alzheimer's disease, another neurodegenerative disease, [...] "may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> close to the bone". They ultimately took up the offer and wrote a screenplay based on Genova's novel in early 2012. Elements of the story were lifted from Glatzer's experience with ALS and Westmoreland's role as his primary caregiver.|$|E
500|$|... "Living for Love" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna, Diplo and Ariel Rechtshaid, with additional writing from MoZella and Toby Gad. Madonna's collaboration with Diplo was revealed in May 2014 through an image on her Instagram showing her {{working on her}} laptop with him. She had invited him for her annual Oscar party, {{and he could not}} make it. So he began texting with her about music and sent some music. Madonna replied with a 20-page text containing her anecdotes on the music. Following this they started collaborating for the album. In an interview with Idolator, Diplo explained that Madonna had asked him to provide his [...] "craziest record" [...] for the album. Together they wrote and recorded seven songs and Diplo added that [...] "Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding. We really pushed the envelope with some of the stuff we were doing... he was up for anything. I love when an artist gives a producer the confidence he needs to work with them, and Madonna was very open-minded to my ideas... she was down from day one." [...] According to Diplo, [...] "Living for Love" [...] had almost 20 versions ranging from a piano ballad to an EDM composition, ultimately Madonna and Diplo compromising on a middle level. Rechtshaid and British singer MNEK also joined for writing sessions with them, improving the verse of the song. Madonna denied that there were 20 versions of the song, admitting it [...] "might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> high", and commented on how she wanted it to sound: ...|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} generally positive reviews from most music critics. Sam Lanksy of Idolator gave the song a favorable review, calling it [...] "an emotional ballad that shows off Mars’ sweet vocals." [...] Lansky also praised it, naming it [...] "another exceptional offering from Unorthodox Jukebox, which {{is shaping up}} {{to be one of the}} year’s best pop releases." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Pop Dust gave the song a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting that 'When I Was Your Man' is [...] "a much more satisfying, less ostentatious ballad than 'Young Girls'— though maybe the lyrics are a little too clichéd to result in a classic soul ballad the way Bruno seems to be going for." [...] However, he praised Mars, which according to him, [...] "nobody puts a song like this over quite like him, and when he hits the big high note on the song’s bridge, it’s about as striking a moment as you’re likely to hear on a pop record this year. It might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> perfect to be as devastating as a song like 'Someone Like You', but it might be a big hit just the same, and it’s guaranteed to absolutely slay in a live set." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly was positive, writing that [...] "Old-school charm still gets Mars the furthest, and the best thing here is the classic torch song 'When I Was Your Man', which finds him at the piano listing all the ways he wronged an ex. 'Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life,' he cries in his Sinatra-smooth tenor, oozing charm. Maybe he's a jerk. But he's the jerk that girl's going home with tonight." ...|$|E

500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger noted [...] "I use {{the phrase}} 'funny forgives a lot' in my 30 Rock reviews when an episode fails to cohere but is still entertaining. [...] That changed with 'Audition Day', which still wasn't 30 Rock at its peak but which had one perfect, hilarious sequence that almost singlehandedly redeemed the episode for me." [...] He enjoyed Jack's scene in the subway, calling it [...] "the funniest moment" [...] from the episode, and [...] "one of the funniest things Alec Baldwin has done on the show in a long time". TV Squad's Bob Sassone wrote {{that he did not}} enjoy Jack's plot, explaining that the bedbug bit [...] "got to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> much", and much preferred Jenna and Tracy's storyline [...] "because it fit in with the auditioning plot." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik opined that this was an [...] "amusing episode overall", and was glad that it gave Scott Adsit's Pete [...] "something to do" [...] here. Los Angeles Timess Meredith Blake was favorable towards [...] "Audition Day", writing it was a [...] "fine return to form", following the airing of [...] "Stone Mountain", which she disliked. IGN contributor Robert Canning said this episode of 30 Rock had fun, comedic chaos, and that it [...] "worked well, but never quite reached the hilarity tipping point." [...] He disliked that Brian Williams' cameo was ruined by the promos [...] "because the surprise of the bit would have been far funnier than what the bit actually turned out to be." [...] Canning said the auditions were [...] "fun, though not a complete knockout", enjoyed the fact that Kathy participated in the auditions and her Susan Boyle reference [...] "had great timing", and was [...] "let down" [...] by the revelation that Jayden was psychotic, noting it [...] "eemed like a bit of a cop out to the story as a whole." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave this episode an 8.2 out of 10 rating.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} of three segments, the Simpsons visit Morocco (which Homer {{mistakes}} for Monaco). Homer purchases a severed monkey's hand that will grant four wishes, despite the vendor's warning that the wisher will experience grave misfortune. Back in Springfield, the family argues in how to use the wishes. Despite Marge's warning to heed the advice of the vendor in not using any of them, Maggie is granted that first wish: a new pacifier. Next, Bart wishes for the Simpsons to be rich and famous. His wish is granted, but the people immediately tire of the family's annoying antics, cheesy merchandise and celebrity treatment. Horrified by these wasteful wishes, Lisa wishes for world peace and Homer is furious. While all countries declare peace and destroy their weapons, the aliens Kang and Kodos realize the human race is [...] "ripe for the plucking" [...] and, armed with only a slingshot and a club, enslave the Earth. At the house, Homer blames Lisa and deems her own wishes to be selfish. She defends herself, claiming that Bart and Maggie's own wishes were also selfish as well and felt that hers was the only selfless one. Soon, Marge catches the people who are angry with the Simpsons and calls for a temporary truce in the family. Determined to make a wish that could not be twisted, she begs Homer {{to do the right thing}} and use the last wish to get rid of the aliens. Much to her dismay, Homer refuses and demands a turkey sandwich, but the turkey turns out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> dry. With all the wishes used up, he goes to throw out the paw, but his neighbor Ned asks about it. Hoping to see Flanders suffer, Homer gladly hands the paw over. Ned's first wish is to [...] "Get rid of those awful aliens," [...] which is accomplished when Moe chases after Kodos with a board with a nail sticking out of it, then brings the aliens back to the flying saucer. Kodos laments their failed invasion, but Kang assures him that humanity is doomed: [...] they will end up in an arms race creating increasingly larger boards and larger nails, which will ultimately [...] "cause the human race to create a board with a nail in it so big to doom mankind." [...] Everyone celebrates and after Flanders wishes to [...] "spruce up the ol' homestead," [...] his house is converted into an opulent castle, making Homer envious. Lisa wakes up from her nightmare and begs Bart to keep her company. Bart sleepily complies after Lisa gives him a candy necklace. Bart then has a nightmare.|$|E
500|$|Released to {{positive}} reviews, with aggregated scores of 87/100 on Metacritic and 88.7% on GameRankings, some journalists considered Super Monkey Ball {{the highlight of}} the GameCube's launch lineup. The staff of Edge praised the main game as [...] "absorb" [...] due to its high level of difficulty, noting that the trial and error required to complete challenging levels forces one to learn the nuances of its [...] "reductive control system" [...] and eventually enables the player to perform seemingly impossible tasks with increasing ease: [...] "Once a level falls, the mysticism around it vanishes. It's beatable; it's an afterthought on the route to your next impossible hurdle." [...] Writing for GameSpy, Ben Turner commented on the [...] "excellent progression of difficulty" [...] engendered by three distinct difficulty modes and thoughtful stage design, expounding [...] "most levels introduce some new idea or concept to the game" [...] and [...] "every single level played adds to your skill." [...] IGN's Matt Casamassina commended the [...] "great level variation", with [...] "well created mazes and puzzles that must be completed using a combination of physics calculations, careful planning and a huge helping of patience." [...] Turner complimented the frequent introduction of incentives to keep playing such as additional continues and hidden levels, adding that a high [...] "ceiling of mastery" [...] enhanced the game's longevity through a [...] "simple but well conceived" [...] scoring system and the ability to test strategies in practice mode. Edge and Casamassina thought similarly, with the latter stating [...] "there are shortcuts that can be carved out by the crafty player, physics to be considered when navigating and more." [...] N-Sider's Tim Knowles pointed out that [...] "the latter levels in the game get extremely difficult and you will often get frustrated", while Casamassina felt [...] "it may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> difficult for the casual gamer." [...] However, N-Sider's Mark Medina called the learning curve [...] "perfectly spot on": [...] "Any falling off the platforms feels entirely your fault and at the same time, you always get the sense that you're just that little bit closer to that elusive goal." [...] Edge and N-Sider's Jason Nuyens and Will Stevenson agreed with this sentiment, with the latter emphasizing the addictive quality of the gameplay. On a technical note, GamePros Four-Eyed Dragon faulted the camera system, which [...] "can get out of position, making it hard to maneuver in tight spots." [...] In The Japan Times, Steven L. Kent described the game as [...] "a test of nerve" [...] requiring [...] "advanced eye–hand coordination." [...] Turner reflected on the game's ability to evoke feelings of [...] "nervous excitement", [...] "intensity", and [...] "electrifying, stomach-wrenching fear": [...] "It's a thrilling feeling to be winding down a paper-thin path with ten seconds on the clock, hoping against hope that you can keep your balance for just a few more seconds and make it to the goal before time expires." [...] Edge opined that the game is [...] "defined" [...] by [...] "unrefined and angular" [...] emotions: ...|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{scored the}} game 7.6 out of 10, writing [...] "it might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> {{straightforward}} in spots, {{but it does}} make for a solid action game." [...] He concluded that [...] "although The Suffering tends to rely more on startling you with visual effects and sudden attacks than on actually trying to scare you, it's still a pretty refreshing take on horror-themed games. [...] more monsters, more ways to do them in, and perhaps some slightly more-involving puzzles would have probably made the game feel more in-depth. But even taking this into consideration, The Suffering is a fun action game." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band's debut album, Razbliuto!, was {{released}} in September 2006 on Just Music. Produced by Ressel, at Sound & Motion, it received praise from critics. The album's maturity and lyrical playfulness created something that was experimentally ambitious, yet accessible as noted by critics. During the recording, the band was introduced to Ou Tim, a session musician and multi-instrumentalist. After recording the album, he joined the band as their on-stage drummer and percussionist. The album won the Best Alternative Album at the 13th South African Music Awards in 2007, beating established favourite Chris Chameleon. After the release, Lark focused on securing tour dates in Europe, as the album failed to attract airplay on national radio stations.

2500|$|Complexity. Doubts were {{expressed}} as to workability of FATCA {{due to its}} complexity, and the legislative timetable for implementation was pushed back multiple times. According to U.S. national taxpayer advocate Nina Olsen in regards to FATCA: [...] "This {{is a piece of}} legislation that is so big and so far-reaching, and [...] so many different moving pieces, and is rolling out in an incremental fashion (...) that you really won’t be able to know what its consequences are, intended or otherwise,’ Olson said. [...] "I don’t think we’ll know that for years. And by that point we’ll actually <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> late to go, [...] "Oops, my bad, we shouldn’t have done this,’ and then try to unwind it." [...] Bloomberg reported in 2015 that the IRS help center is not able to provide adequate taxpayer customer service. In 2016, the Taxpayer Advocate reported that [...] "FATCA implementation has created significant compliance burdens and risk exposures" [...] for overseas Americans, and its [...] "heavy-handed approach, especially when combined with the complexity surrounding IRS requirements, has negative consequences, both for FFIs and the IRS".|$|E
2500|$|Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Exceptionally {{beautiful}} to behold and bolstered by a stellar vocal cast, this umpteenth film rendition of Rudyard Kipling's tales of young Mowgli's adventures amongst the {{creatures of the}} Indian jungle proves entirely engaging, even if it's ultimately lacking in subtext and thematic heft." [...] Andrew Barker of Variety felt that this version [...] "can't rival the woolly looseness of Disney's 1967 animated classic, of course, but it succeeds on its own so well that such comparisons are barely necessary." [...] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph gave the film four stars out of five, and deemed it [...] "a sincere and full-hearted adaptation that returns to Kipling for fresh inspiration." [...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap says [...] "This 'Book' might lack the post-vaudeville razzamatazz of its predecessor, but director Jon Favreau {{and a team of}} effects wizards plunge us into one of the big screen's most engrossing artificial worlds since Avatar." [...] Peter Bradshaw, writing for The Guardian, gave the film four out of five stars and felt that the film had a touch of Apocalypto in it, finding the plot elements to be similar to those in The Lion King. He wrote that the film was [...] "spectacular, exciting, funny and fun" [...] and that it [...] "handsomely revives the spirit of Disney's original film." [...] Pete Hammond of Deadline.com wrote that the film had laughs, excitement, an exceptional voice cast and, most importantly, a lot of heart, calling it a cinematic achievement like no other. He particularly praised Murray's performance and the visual effects, deeming it [...] "simply astonishing." [...] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly graded the film an [...] "A–," [...] calling it one of the biggest surprises of 2016. He, however, felt the two songs were rather unnecessary and distracting, and believed the film to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> frightening for children.|$|E
