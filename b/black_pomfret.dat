The total mortality coefficient (Z) and the fishing mortality (F) of the <b>black</b> <b>pomfret</b> were at high levels, the exploitation ratio (E) was over 0. 5, {{and the number of}} captured juvenile fishes showed that the stock of <b>black</b> <b>pomfret</b> in this area was overexploited and improper fishing gear was utilized.

The smaller change of the fork length at first maturity of the two fishes has indicated a more vulnerable fishery ecosystem in this area. Therefore, in addition to the traditional fishery management approach, such as taking the minimum length into consideration, ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAF) should be taken to improve the practical fishing management, including conserving the small pelagic fishery population in order to achieve the sustainable fishing of the stocks...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to answer same question about what fish commodities would be developed {{in order to improve}} fishermen income and to make a high contribution on the economy of Cilacap Regency of Central Java Province by using Location Quotient Analysis. The objectives of this research are (1) to analyze what commodity which based on capture fishery sector; and (2) to analyze primer fish commodities from capture fisheries sector. his research method used study and continued to descriptive analysis. Data were analyzed in this research came from secondary data i. e production data of Cilacap, of Central Java Province from 1999 to 2003. Data were analyzed by using economical mathematics which is supported by Excel computer program. The result showed that (1) commodities which based on capture fisheries sector that would be a key factor for regional development of Cilacap Regency had LQ values were bigger then I, therefore for regional the commodity might be exported. For example in big pelagic fish i. e. skipjack tuna LQ= 23. 27) and snapper (LQ= 1. 22); in demersal fish i. e. white pomfret (LQ= 9. 72), layur (LQ= 8. 38), <b>black</b> <b>pomfret</b> (LQ= 6. 75) and shark (LQ= 6. 14), shrimp (LQ= 8. 77) and squid (LQ= 1. 40), (2) primer commodity of fish from capture fisheries of Cilacap Regency, i. e. skipjack tuna, layur, shark, shrimp, and squid, snapper, white pomfret and <b>black</b> <b>pomfret.</b> Those primer fish commodities would be promote as key commodities in capture fisheries development because they would improve income and their contribution in regional economy in terms of export value...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to quantitatively determine the fatty acid contents of 20 species of marine fish and four species of shellfish from Straits of Malacca. Most samples contained fairly high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, C 18 : 3 n 3), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C 20 : 5 n 3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C 22 : 6 n 3). Longtail shad, yellowstripe scad, and moonfish contained significantly higher (P< 0. 05) amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), respectively. Meanwhile, fringescale sardinella, malabar red snapper, <b>black</b> <b>pomfret,</b> Japanese threadfin bream, giant seaperch, and sixbar grouper showed considerably high content (537. 2 – 944. 1 [*]mg/ 100 g wet sample) of desirable omega- 3 fatty acids. The polyunsaturated-fatty-acids/saturated-fatty-acids (P/S) ratios for most samples were higher than that of Menhaden oil (P/S= 0. 58), a recommended PUFA supplement which may help to lower blood pressure. Yellowstripe scad (highest DHA, ω- 3 /ω- 6 = 6. 4, P/S= 1. 7), moonfish (highest ALA, ω- 3 /ω- 6 = 1. 9, P/S= 1. 0), and longtail shad (highest EPA, ω- 3 /ω- 6 = 0. 8, P/S= 0. 4) were the samples with an outstandingly desirable overall composition of fatty acids. Overall, the marine fish and shellfish from the area contained good composition of fatty acids which offer health benefits and may be used for nutraceutical purposes in the future...|$|E
40|$|Utilization {{of fishing}} area in Banten Bay by various {{activities}} may cause multi sectors conflicts related to {{management of the}} bay. The integrated zone system in that area has not been established yet; therefore it is needed to be studied. The objectives {{of this study were}} to 1) determine fishing season and fishing ground; 2) determine indicators and criteria of fishing zone; 3) establish fishing zone. The study was conducted in four fish landing centers which are located in Karangantu, Terate, Wadas, and Kepuh from January to April 2010. Data were collected by surveying analyzed using the fishing season index analysis, relationship analysis between sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a and fish abundance, and GIS analysis. Based on the results, it were revealed that 1) peak fishing season of pelagic fish was from November to January and demersal fish was from November to December; 2) the catches from fishing grounds surrounding Panjang island were anchovies, trevallies, squids, Indian mackerels, pony fishes, Fringescale sardinella; surrounding Pamujan besar island were threadfin bream, shrimps; and surrounding Tunda island were eastern little tuna, narrow barred king mackerels, <b>black</b> <b>pomfret,</b> red snapper, great trevally, scads, mullets, squids; 3) development indicators of fishing zone were (i) feasibility of fishing ground, (ii) compatibility of fishing gears with fishing grounds, (iii) possibility of conflicts, (iv) infrastructure, (v) carrying capacity of environment; 4) Banten bay water was divided into three fishing zones, they were (i) passive zone, (ii) passive and outboard motor zone, (iii) active and inboard motor zone...|$|E
40|$|Three {{species of}} Opisthomonorcheides Parukhin, 1966 are {{reported}} {{for the first time}} from Indonesian waters: O. pampi (Wang, 1982) Liu, Peng, Gao, Fu, Wu, Lu, Gao & Xiao, 2010 and O. ovacutus (Mamaev, 1970) Machida, 2011 from Parastromateus niger (Bloch), and O. decapteri Parukhin, 1966 from Atule mate (Cuvier). Both O. pampi and O. ovacutus can now be considered widespread in the Indo-Pacific region, with earlier records of these species being from Fujian Province, China and Penang, Malaysia, respectively. We redescribe O. decapteri from one of its original hosts, Atule mate, off New Caledonia, and report this species from Jakarta Bay, Indonesia, extending its range throughout the Indian Ocean into the south-western Pacific. All three species possess a genital atrium that is long, sometimes very long, and a genital pore that is located in the forebody. This validates the interpretation that the original description was erroneous in reporting the genital pore in the hindbody, well posterior to the ventral sucker. These observations verify the synonymy of Retractomonorchis Madhavi, 1977 with Opisthomonorcheides. A major discrepancy between the species of Opisthomonorcheides is that some are described with the uterus entering the terminal organ laterally and some with it entering terminally; this feature needs further analysis. Based on the length of the genital atrium and the posterior extent of the vitellarium, the 27 species of Opisthomonorcheides considered valid can be divided into four groups. Among the 53 host records analysed, the families Carangidae (53 % of records), Stromateidae (17 %) and Serranidae (5. 7 %) are the most common; the reports are overwhelmingly from members of the Perciformes (91 %), with further records in the Clupeiformes (5. 7 %), Gadiformes (1. 9 %) and Pleuronectiformes (1. 9 %). Two fish genera (Parastromateus Bleeker and Pampus Bonaparte) dominate the recorded hosts, with the <b>black</b> <b>pomfret</b> Parastromateus niger harbouring six species, the silver pomfret Pampus argenteus (Euphrasen) harbouring six, and the Chinese silver pomfret P. chinensis (Euphrasen) two. A host-parasite checklist is presented. We discuss the host-specificity of members of the genus, questioning some records such as that of O. decapteri in a deep-sea macrourid. We also comment on the morphological similarity, but phylogenetic distance, between the various Pomfret species, advancing the possibility that a series of host misidentifications has occurred. Sequences of the ITS 2 rDNA gene generated for O. pampi and O. ovacutus are briefly discussed and molecular data are lodged in the GenBank database...|$|E
