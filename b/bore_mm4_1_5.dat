40|$|Alternative {{splicing}} creates several Na(v) <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> transcripts in the mammalian myocardium and {{in various}} other tissues including brain, dorsal root ganglia, breast cancer cells {{as well as}} neuronal stem cell lines. In total nine Na(v) <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> splice variants have been discovered. Four of them, namely Na(v) <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> a, Na(v) <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> c, Na(v) <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> d, and Na(v) <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> e, generate functional channels in heterologous expression systems. The significance of alternatively spliced transcripts for cardiac excitation, in particular their role in SCN 5 A channelopathies, is less well understood. In the present study, we systematically investigated electrophysiological properties of mutant T 1620 K channels {{in the background of}} all known functional Na(v) <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> splice variants in HEK 293 cells. This mutation has been previously associated with two distinct cardiac excitation disorders: with long QT syndrome type 3 (LQT 3) and isolated cardiac conduction disease (CCD). When investigating the effect of the T 1620 K mutation, we noticed similar channel defects in the background of hNa(v) <b>1.</b> <b>5,</b> hNa(v) <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> a, and hNa(v) <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> c. In contrast, the hNa(v) <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> d background produced differential effects: In the mutant channel, some gain-of-function features did not emerge, whereas loss-of-function became more pronounced. In case of hNa(v) <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> e, the neonatal variant of hNa(v) <b>1.</b> <b>5,</b> both the splice variant itself as well as the corresponding mutant channel showed electrophysiological properties that were distinct from the wild-type and mutant reference channels, hNa(v) <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> and T 1620 K, respectively. In conclusion, our data show that alternative splicing is a mechanism capable of generating a variety of functionally distinct wild-type and mutant hNa(v) <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> channels.

40|$|The overall aims of this PhD were (1) to {{evaluate}} the mechanisms controlling functional expression of neonatal Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> (nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5),</b> the predominant voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) subtype expressed in metastatic human breast cancer (BCa) cells, and (2) to characterize the electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> compared with the adult Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> (aNav <b>1.</b> <b>5)</b> counterpart. Experiments were carried out under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The Results chapter- 1 demonstrates the hypoxic upregulation of functional VGSC (nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5)</b> expression in MDA-MB- 231 human BCa cells, proposed to occur via positive feedback involving Na+ influx and activation of protein kinase A. Upregulation of nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5,</b> evident at mRNA, protein and signalling levels, led to significant augmentation of Matrigel invasion. The hypoxia-sensitive persistent Na+ current (INaP) {{played a significant role}} in the increased invasiveness. The Results chapter- 2 shows that, compared to aNav <b>1.</b> <b>5,</b> nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> (i) exhibited depolarized activation, (ii) had slower activation/inactivation kinetics, (iii) allowed greater transient charge (Na+) influx, (iv) recovered from inactivation significantly more slowly, (v) exhibited greater use-dependent attenuation, and (vi) expressed larger INaP. Mutagenesis studies revealed the charge-reversing Asp 211 (aNav <b>1.</b> <b>5)</b> to Lys 211 (nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5)</b> switch to be predominantly responsible for these differences. Surprisingly, however, challenging the two splice variants with mono-, di- and trivalent cations generated only subtle differential effects in channel gating. The Results chapter- 3 determines the sensitivities of nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> and aNav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> to various VGSC blockers. The effects of small-molecule drugs lidocaine, phenytoin, mexiletine, procaine, ranolazine and riluzole were similar. NESOpAb, a polyclonal antibody targeting nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5,</b> exhibited 200 -fold lower threshold and 5 -fold lower IC 50 for inhibiting nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> vs. aNav <b>1.</b> 5; the Lys/Asp 211 residue was crucial to this difference.

Ankyrin-G and Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> are both localized at intercalated disc and T-tubule membranes in cardiomyocytes, and Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> coimmunoprecipitates with 190 -kDa ankyrin-G from detergent-soluble lysates from rat heart. These data suggest that Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> associates with ankyrin-G and that ankyrin-G is required for Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> localization at excitable membranes in cardiomyocytes. Together with previous work in neurons, these results in cardiomyocytes suggest that ankyrin-G participates in a common pathway for localization of voltage-gated Nav channels at sites of function in multiple excitable cell types...|$|R
40|$|Background: Increased {{expression}} of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) have been implicated with strong metastatic potential of human {{breast cancer in}} vitro and in vivo where the main culprits are cardiac isoform Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> and its ‘neonatal’ splice variant, nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5.</b> Several factors {{have been associated with}} Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> and nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> gain of expression in breast cancer mainly hormones, and growth factors. Aim: This study aimed to investigate the role of epigenetics via transcription repressor, repressor element silencing transcription factor (REST) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) in enhancing Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> and nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> expression in human breast cancer by assessing the effect of HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). Methods: The less aggressive human breast cancer cell line, MCF- 7 cells which lack Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> and nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> expression was treated with TSA at a concentration range 10 – 10, 000 ng/ml for 24 h whilst the aggressive MDA-MB- 231 cells was used as control. The effect of TSA on Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5,</b> nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5,</b> REST, HDAC <b>1,</b> HDAC 2, HDAC 3, MMP 2 and N-cadherin gene expression level was analysed by real-time PCR. Cell growth (MTT assay) and metastatic behaviors (lateral motility and migration assays) were also measured. Results: mRNA expression level of Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> and nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> were initially very low in MCF- 7 compared to MDA-MB- 231 cells. Inversely, mRNA expression level of REST, HDAC 1, HDAC 2, and HDAC 3 were all greater in MCF- 7 compared to MDA-MB- 231 cells. Treatment with TSA significantly increased the mRNA expression level of Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> and nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> in MCF- 7 cells. On the contrary, TSA significantly reduced the mRNA expression level of REST and HDAC 2 in this cell line. Remarkably, despite cell growth inhibition by TSA, motility and migration of MCF- 7 cells were enhanced after TSA treatment, confirmed with the up-regulation of metastatic markers, MMP 2 and N-cadherin. Conclusions: This study identified epigenetics as another factor that regulate the expression level of Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> and nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> in breast cancer where REST and HDAC 2 play important role as epigenetic regulators that when lacking enhances the {{expression of}} Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> and nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> thus promotes motility and migration of breast cancer. Elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms for gain of Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> and nNav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> expression may be helpful for seeking effective strategies for the management of metastatic diseases...|$|R
40|$|Voltage-gated Nav {{channels}} {{are required for}} normal electrical activity in neurons, skeletal muscle, and cardiomyocytes. In the heart, Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> is the predominant Nav channel, and Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> -dependent activity regulates rapid upstroke of the cardiac action potential. Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> activity requires precise localization at specialized cardiomyocyte membrane domains. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Nav channel trafficking in the heart are unknown. In this paper, we demonstrate that ankyrin-G is required for Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> targeting in the heart. Cardiomyocytes with reduced ankyrin-G display reduced Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> expression, abnormal Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> membrane targeting, and reduced Na+ channel current density. We define the structural requirements on ankyrin-G for Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> interactions and demonstrate that loss of Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> targeting {{is caused by the}} loss of direct Nav <b>1.</b> <b>5</b> –ankyrin-G interaction. These data are the first report of a cellular pathway required for Nav channel trafficking in the heart and suggest that ankyrin-G is critical for cardiac depolarization and Nav channel organization in multiple excitable tissues...|$|R
