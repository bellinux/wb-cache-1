40|$|The aim of my bachelor´s {{thesis is}} a design and an {{assessment}} of a steel construction of an outdoor crane runway. The crane runway is used for operations of two bridge cranes. Each bridge crane has 40 tons of lifting capacity. The construction of the crane runway {{is located in a}} site of a factory for prefabricated concrete elements. The length of the track is 100 meters and the span of the crane bridge is 25 meters. The upper surface of cantilever is 10 meters above ground. A central beam of the crane runway consists of an uniaxially symmetrical welded I profile which is made from steel of the grade S 355. Every single bar of a horizontal <b>bracing</b> <b>beam</b> is made from steel of the grade S 235. Columns are designed as solid-web welded I profiles and they are made from steel of the grade S 235. These columns are transversely fixed. Spatial rigidity in the longitudinal direction of the construction is provided by braking bracings. These bracings are designed as simple cross layout...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{bachelor}} thesis is recalculation the crane runaway according to current Eurocodes (CSN EN 1991 - 3 a CSN EN 1993 - 6) comparing results with the recalculation according to previous standards (CSN 27 0103 and CSN 27 0101). In the hall {{there is one}} trolley crane. Its capacities is 12, 5 tons. The structure is designed for the area of city Koprivnice. The main beam 12, 0 m in length is welded biaxial symmetric I profile. Heigth of the beam is 800 mm, width is 300 mm, thickness of the flange 30 mm and web thickness is 30 mm. Horizontal <b>bracing</b> <b>beam</b> is truss girder - one belt is the upper belt of the main crane beam and second one is made from the half of HEB 140 profile. On the horizontal truss girder there is revision footbridge. Diagonals 1803 mm in length are designed from L 70 x 70 x 7 profile. Vertical beam length is 1000 mm and is made from L 50 x 50 x 5 profile. Length of truss is 1500 mm. Free belt of horizontal truss is supported by angled bars, which are connected to upper belt of the main crane beam, creating a fulltruss system in oblique level...|$|E

30|$|Another {{proposed}} setup of precast {{prestressed concrete}} brace is V shaped; this proposed brace {{consists of two}} precast concrete diagonal legs that are connected {{in the middle of}} the beam (Figs.  20, 21). This proposed V shape seems to have the benefits of both X shape and single diagonal, the middle section is omitted like the single diagonal brace which may lead to faster and more economical seismic method and unlike the single diagonal the length of each leg is reduced that hinders (postponed) buckling of brace. The challenge is proper connection of the <b>brace</b> to <b>beam</b> and dealing with shear force applied by <b>brace</b> to <b>beam.</b>|$|R

40|$|Analytical and {{experimental}} studies {{were made to}} develop design procedures for steel gusset plate connections in diagonally braced frames. Stiffness and strength models of structural fasteners based on physical tests were incorporated into inelastic finite element analyses. The modeling techniques were verified by comparing analytical {{and experimental}} results of full scale connection tests. Finite element models of bracing connections were generated to determine gusset plate force, stress, strain, and displacement distributions {{for a variety of}} connection designs including K-bracing and X-bracing. Based on these results current design procedures were scrutinized and new design procedures were proposed for predicting the tensile strength, buckling strength, and force distributions for bracing connections. Additionally, it was found that gusseted beam-to-column connections are rigid (AISC Type I) and the centroidal axes of the <b>brace,</b> <b>beam,</b> and column members do not necessarily need to intersect at a common working point...|$|R

40|$|Recent seismic events {{pointed out}} the high {{vulnerability}} of existing industrial facilities, stressing on safety and high losses inherent to interruption of economic activities and release of environmentally hazardous materials. These structures often have irregular geometry and structural configuration, are subject to aging and corrosion, and are designed without specific performance-based or seismic design criteria. Due to these inherent complexities, retrofit using friction isolators can be a viable and practical solution for performance improvements. This work presents {{a case study of}} irregular industrial storage plant structure consisting of a group of six elevated silos resting on a steel frame on one side and connected to a vaulted RC structure on the other. A computational model is built incorporating nonlinearities from the components (<b>braces,</b> <b>beams,</b> columns, etc.) and from the mitigation devices. Retrofit using friction isolators is analyzed and evaluated through linear and nonlinear dynamic analyses under a set of natural ground motions. Results show the effectiveness of the mitigation strategy in terms of performance improvement...|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} brace {{consists of}} two precast concrete diagonal legs that are connected {{in the middle of}} the beam in a V-shaped setup. This proposed V-shaped seams have the benefits of the two last proposed systems, X-shaped and single diagonal. In this proposed brace, the middle section is omitted like single diagonal brace which may lead to faster and more economical seismic method and unlike the single diagonal the length of each leg is reduced (in comparison to single diagonal brace) and the result is that slender ratio of brace is reduced which leads to more lateral load bearing before buckling of brace. But the challenge is connecting the <b>brace</b> to the <b>beam</b> properly and dealing with shear force applied by <b>brace</b> to <b>beam.</b> Design of proper section is beyond the realm of the current paper and it is suggested for future researches.|$|R

40|$|Annual Stability Conference, ASC; Pittsburgh, PA; United States; 10 May 2011 through 14 May 2011 Flange and web local {{buckling}} in beam plastic hinge regions of steel moment frames can prevent beam-column connections from achieving adequate plastic rotations under earthquake-induced forces. This threat is especially valid for existing steel moment frame buildings with beams that lack adequate flange/web slenderness ratios. As {{the use of}} fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) have increased in strengthening and repair of steel members in recent years, using FRPs in stabilizing local instabilities have also attracted attention. Previous computational {{studies have shown that}} longitudinally oriented glass FRP (GFRP) strips may serve to moderately <b>brace</b> <b>beam</b> flanges against the occurrence of {{local buckling}} during plastic hinging. An experimental study was conducted at Izmir Institute of Technology investigating the effects of GFRP reinforcement on local buckling behavior of existing steel I-beams with flange slenderness ratios (FSR) exceeding the slenderness limits set forth in current seismic design specifications and modified by a bottom flange triangular welded haunch. Four European HE 400 AA steel beams with a depth/width ratio of 1. 26 and FSR of 11. 4 were cyclically loaded up to 4 % rotation in a cantilever beam test set-up. Both bare beams and beams with GFRP sheets were tested in order to investigate the contribution of GFRP sheets in mitigating local flange buckling. Different configurations of GFRP sheets were considered. The tests have shown that GFRP reinforcement can moderately mitigate inelastic flange local buckling.

40|$|The ANSI/AISC 360 - 10 Appendix- 6 {{provisions}} provide limited {{guidance on}} the bracing requirements for beam-columns. In cases involving point (nodal) or shear panel (relative) lateral bracing only, these provisions simply sum the corresponding strength and stiffness requirements for column and <b>beam</b> <b>bracing.</b> Based on prior research evidence, {{it is expected}} that this approach is accurate to conservative when the requirements can be logically added. However, in many practical beam-column bracing situations, the requirements cannot be logically added. This is because {{of the importance of the}} brace and transverse load position through the cross-section depth, as well as the fact that both torsional and lateral restraint can be important attributes of the general bracing problem. These attributes of the bracing problem can cause the current beam-column bracing requirement predictions to be unconservative. In addition, limited guidance is available in the broader literature at the current time regarding the appropriate consideration of combined lateral and torsional <b>bracing</b> of I-section <b>beams</b> and beam-columns. Nevertheless, this situation is quite common, particularly for beam-columns, since it is rare that separate and independent lateral bracing systems would be provided for both flanges. More complete guidance is needed for the proper consideration of combined <b>bracing</b> of I-section <b>beams</b> and beam-columns in structural design. This research focuses on a reasonably comprehensive evaluation of the bracing strength and stiffness requirements for doubly-symmetric I-section beams and beam-columns using refined Finite Element Analysis (FEA) test simulation. The research builds on recent simulation studies of the basic <b>bracing</b> behavior of <b>beams</b> subjected to uniform bending. Various cases of beam members subjected to moment gradient are considered first. This is followed by a wide range of studies of beam-column members subjected to constant axial load and uniform bending as well as axial load combined with moment gradient loading. A range of unbraced lengths are considered resulting in different levels of plasticity at the member strength limit states. In addition, various bracing configurations are addressed including point (nodal) lateral, shear panel (relative) lateral, point torsional, combined point lateral and point torsional, and combined shear panel lateral and point torsional bracing.
