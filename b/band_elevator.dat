40|$|Purpose. A drive behaves to {{the basic}} {{elements}} of scoop <b>band</b> <b>elevators.</b> To determine the drive power calculations are carried out according to standard methods, which take plenty of time. It is necessary to conduct the analysis of influence of project characteristics on the parameters of high-speed drive in a scoop bent elevator and to build the improved algorithm of speed-up determination of its drive power on project descriptions, that will take into account the type of load, rise height, necessary productivity, standard parameters of scoops and tape. Methodology. Using parametric dependences of elevators drive power on its project characteristics, received by the author earlier, the improved algorithm of speed-up determination of elevators high-speed drive power with deep and shallow scoops at set type of load, productivity, rise height was offered. Findings. The algorithm of drive power speed-up determination of high-speed vertical elevators with deep and shallow scoops depending on project parameters was offered. The example of such algorithm application is considered for an elevator that is intended for transporting of cement. Analytical dependences of drive power of such elevator are determined on the productivity and rise height. Corresponding graphic dependences were built and character of drive power changes during the size changing of any project characteristics was determined. Originality. The improved algorithm of drive power elevator determination at the given project characteristics (type of load, rise height, productivity) that takes into account standard sizes, parameters of scoops and ribbons, was built at first time. Practical value. The use of an offered algorithm of calculation gives the possibility of relatively fast determination of reference value of high-speed elevators drive power with deep and shallow scoops, to build graphic dependences of drive power on the values of the productivity and rise height at the certain type of load, that assists the quality selection of his basic elements at certain project descriptions, such algorithm gives an opportunity to save time on calculations in the process of elevators planning...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. One {{of basic}} {{elements}} of <b>band</b> bucket <b>elevators</b> is their drive. For determination of power drive {{it is necessary to}} conduct calculations on standard by methods, in what it is needed to expend enough time. One of project parameters is productivity of elevator. It is necessary to build parametric dependence of power drive of elevator on its design capacity that takes into account a type and descriptions of load, lifting height, standard sizes and parameters of buckets and tapes. Methodology. Using the method of hauling calculation of <b>band</b> buckets <b>elevators,</b> the parametric dependences of power drive of high-speed elevators are built with deep and shallow buckets from their productivity at fixed type of load and height of getting up. Findings. It is set {{on the basis of the}} built parametric dependences that the change function of a size of elevator power from design capacity (at fixed to the lifting height, load type, rate of tape movement) is piecewise and droningly increasing. The intervals of project values of productivity, which provide the permanent size of elevator power drive are certain in a general view. As the example of application of the recived results the construction process of power drive dependence from design capacity of elevator of shotblasting room, which is intended for transporting of the metallic shot using for consolidating of carriage springs, is considered. For concrete type of load and lifting height of such elevator graphic dependence of power drive on productivity was built. Originality. Parametric dependences of elevator power drive on its design capacity were first built, which take into account a type and physical and mechanical descriptions of load, lifting height, standard sizes and parameters of buckets and tapes. Practical value. The use of the built dependences enables in relation to rapid determination of approximate value of power drive of vertical high-speed elevators with deep and shallow buckets on the stage of planning and to execute the high-quality selection of its basic elements at concrete project descriptions: type of load, productivity, lifting height...|$|R
500|$|In October 1966, the Texas <b>band</b> 13th Floor <b>Elevators</b> debuted with The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators. They {{were the}} first group to {{advertise}} themselves as psychedelic rock, having done so {{since the end of}} 1965. The Beach Boys' October 1966 single [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] was another early pop song to incorporate psychedelic lyrics and sounds. Upon release, the single prompted an unexpected revival in theremins and increased the awareness of analog synthesizers. As psychedelia gained prominence, Beach Boys-style harmonies would be ingrained into the newer psychedelic pop.|$|R
5000|$|Dragan Popović, {{with the}} band Maj, {{recorded}} the single [...] "Još uvek sanjam" [...] ("I'm Still Dreaming"), and [...] "A ja bih je ljubio" [...] ("And I Would Kiss Her"), released on the various artists album Uspomene (Memories). After Maj ended their activity, Popović worked as a journalist for Omladinske novine and Mladost. Various artists album Index 202, released in 1981, featured four songs written by him. During 1981 he worked with a short-lived band Dragstor (Drugstore), and later formed the <b>band</b> Lift (<b>Elevator)</b> with the bass guitarist Boba Orlić. He participated in the recording of Doktor Spira i Ljudska Bića album Dijagnoza. During the 1980s {{he worked in the}} Akademija Studio and composed children's music and experimental music. During the 1990s he moved to Sweden, where he performed in clubs, worked as a music teacher. He was a founder of the theatre Teater Kapija, and with the actress Janna Eriksson he formed Mitopa Music Project.|$|R
5000|$|... "We Sell Soul" [...] by the Spades was a {{regional}} hit {{by one of}} the first bands headed by Roky Erickson; {{he was one of the}} founding members of the legendary psychedelic rock <b>band</b> 13th Floor <b>Elevators.</b> Houston's Neil Ford - also spelled Neal Ford - was in a succession of bands including the Ramadas. Their [...] "Shame on You" [...] was included on Essential Pebbles, Volume 2. These Iguanas are not the same band that launched Iggy Pop's career, although a track by those Iguanas is included on Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 19.The track listed as [...] "The Darkest Hour (Part 1)" [...] is actually the instrumental B-side, Part 2.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004 Mathews co-{{produced}} a [...] "Roy Tyler" [...] album, [...] "Three Way Calling" [...] {{and joined}} forces with Raphael Saadiq. He also discovered, signed and produced a fun and reckless band just out of High School called Rock n Roll Soldiers and got them a recording deal with Atlantic Records. Recordings Mathews had made in 1981 {{as part of the}} main personnel with Roky Erickson for his classic, cult-favorite album, [...] "The Evil One", were re-released to huge acclaim on [...] "I Have Always Been Here Before: The Roky Erickson Anthology," [...] a two-CD set that featured his original <b>band,</b> 13th Floor <b>Elevators</b> on one disc and the near frightening material that Mathews worked on the other disc.|$|R
50|$|The {{video was}} filmed over two days: 25/26 November 1994, before the Bizarre Fruit tour kicked off {{and was the}} most {{expensive}} video done to that point. Produced by Matthew Amos, this more adventurous offering showed the <b>band</b> in an <b>elevator</b> moving between floors and watching clubbers come {{in and out of}} the sliding doors exiting onto another dancefloor. Band members Mike Pickering, Paul Heard, and Shovell are in amongst the crowd dancing while Heather stands still singing in a red Oriental-style dress on the other side of the viewing glass, as people dance around her and then leave or even disappear as quickly as they arrived. As the video continues, the camera is continuously panning from right to left encircling the body of the elevator moving from the front where you can see the people dancing to round to the back where you can see the mechanisms in the lift shaft.|$|R
