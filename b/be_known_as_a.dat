5|$|While burghs {{acted as}} centres of basic crafts. These {{included}} {{the manufacture of}} shoes, clothes, dishes, pots, joinery, bread and ale, which would normally be sold to inhabitants and visitors on market days. However, there were relatively few developed manufacturing industries in Scotland {{for most of this}} period. By the late fifteenth century, there were the beginnings of a native iron-casting industry, which led to the production of cannon and of the silver and goldsmithing for which the country would later <b>be</b> <b>known.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, the most important exports were unprocessed raw materials, including wool, hides, salt, fish, animals and coal, while Scotland remained frequently short of wood, iron and, in years of bad harvests, grain, which was imported in large quantities, particularly from the Baltic ports, through Berwick and Ayr.|$|E

25|$|During {{the summer}} months of 1973, Morrison had {{embarked}} on a three-month tour with his eleven-piece band, the Caledonia Soul Orchestra. Although the resulting concerts and live album, It's Too Late to Stop Now, have come to <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> performing high for Morrison, the tour was physically and emotionally exhausting. Morrison decided afterwards to take a vacation break, returning to Ireland after a six-year absence obtensibly to record an RTÉ national TV show. Having gone through divorce proceedings earlier in the year, Morrison was now accompanied by his new fiancee, Carol Guida. The vacation visit lasted nearly three weeks during which time he only toured {{the southern part of}} the island and did not venture into his native Northern Ireland as the province was engulfed in the Troubles.|$|E

25|$|Árbenz {{served as}} defense {{minister}} under President Arévalo. He {{was the first}} minister of this portfolio, since it was previously called the Ministry of War. In 1947 Dr. Arévalo, in company with a friend and two Russian dancers who were visiting Guatemala, had a terrible car accident {{on the road to}} Panajachel: fell into a ravine and was seriously injured, while all his companions were killed. The official party leaders signed a pact with Lieutenant Colonel Arana, in which he pledged not to attempt any coup against the ailing president, in exchange for the revolutionary parties as the official candidate in the next election. However, the recovery of the sturdy president was almost miraculous and soon he was able to take over the government. Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Javier Arana had accepted this pact because he wanted to <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Democratic hero of the uprising against Ponce and believed that the Barranco Pact ensured his position when the time of the presidential elections came.|$|E
25|$|The Statute of Westminster 1931 {{provided}} for the then Dominions—named therein as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State, and Newfoundland—to have full legislative independence as equal members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, having, together with the United Kingdom, one person as the sovereign of each. Subsequently, India and Pakistan (both in 1947) and Ceylon (in 1948) became Dominions. By the early 1950s, in order to reflect the equality between the countries in that group, each (including the United Kingdom, but not the former Irish Free State and India, which had by that time become republics) came to <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> realm. The word was formally used in Britain's proclamation of Elizabeth II as queen in 1952 and was adopted for the modern royal styles and titles under the legislation enacted by the individual countries. The principle was applied to other countries as they became Commonwealth realms, having sovereign status granted directly. The phrase Commonwealth realm, though used officially, is not a statutory term.|$|E
25|$|In the mid 19th century Brympton d'Evercy was {{the home}} of Lady Georgiana Fane, a single lady of modest means who had no need of a large and lavish household. Thus the house was not given the Victorian wings given so {{carelessly}} to so many of Britain's historic houses. Lady Georgiana confined herself to improvements in the gardens and grounds. She added a balustrade to the walls enclosing the forecourt {{in front of the}} west facade; the walls, topped by balustrading, link the priest house, churchyard on the south side, and clock-tower and stables on the north. The effect was to create what in a grander house than Brympton d'Evercy would <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cour d'honneur. Entered through great gate piers crowned by urns (see illustration top of page) the cour d'honneur effect is softened, and de-formalised by lawns and some very English style flower beds. The broad gravel terrace along {{the full extent of the}} south front was also created at this time, along with the large pond which reflects it. Other than necessary restoration work, and installation of modern plumbing and electricity, little has been added to the house since the 19th century. It is now recognised by English Heritage as a grade I listed building.|$|E
50|$|Risers are {{classified}} by three criteria. The first {{is if the}} riser {{is open to the}} atmosphere, if it is then it is called an open riser, otherwise it <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> blind type. The second criterion is where the riser is located; if it is located on the casting then it <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> top riser and if it is located next to the casting it <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> side riser. Finally, if the riser is located on the gating system so that it fills after the molding cavity, it <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> live riser or hot riser, but if the riser fills with materials that have already flowed through the molding cavity it <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dead riser or cold riser.|$|R

25|$|Monghyr {{was thus}} {{occupied}} by Mir Qasim Ali, the Nawab of Bengal (from 1760 to 1764). In 1763, Quasim shifted his capital from Murshidabad to Munger. His new appointee General Gurgin Khan from Isfahan patterned the Bengal Army {{on the lines}} of the British forces. At this fort, a factory for arsenal, for manufacturing of fire-arms was established. This tradition has continued to this day; several hundred families who have specialized in the manufacture of guns are continuing with this old tradition. He further added to the fortifications and also built palaces in the fort. Mir Quasim came to <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> just ruler (he tried to eliminate corruption and injustice) but was also feared by his opponents as a fierce and ruthless warrior. He was also known for encouraging culture and had many scholars in his court. But all this ended soon as he had serious differences on trade and other administrative practices with the British. Mir Qasim later had to use the fort as a base for waging war against the British. But he was defeated in 1764. Later, {{he turned out to be}} a poor looser as he disgraced himself by committing serious atrocities on his own people in Munger fort and also in Patna, and also on the English army and other personnel who were captured in Patna. His criminal atrocities in Patna are known in the historical annals as the ‘Massacre of Patna’. Subsequently, the fort lost its glory. Lord Cornwallis, the Governor General, in British India, had built a country house here.|$|E
25|$|Pursuant to its {{campaign}} pledges, the Mauroy Government established 14,760 new permanent teaching posts {{at the elementary}} and secondary levels in June 1981, and provided for 16,800 more in the 1982 budget and an additional 8,370 in the 1983 budget. A major increase in the modest salaries of elementary school teachers was announced. Technical education at the secondary level was declared to be a priority area, with special attention in the form of more scholarship money, additional teaching positions, and the commitment of 430million francs per year for three years for the introduction of new technologies into the school programme. However, these actions (particularly the creation of only 400 new technical teachers’ positions in 1981, when enrolment went up by 11,000) were seen as inadequate by the National Union of Technical Education-Autonomous Apprenticeship. In December 1981, a general science programme in the eleventh grade (premier) was created to replace the mathematics programme (the Bac C) which, after the fall from favour of Latin and Greek, had come to <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> “royal road into élitist schools and careers.” The Premier S programme was an attempt to postpone definitive scholastic and social segregation, and also to reduce the importance of mathematical aptitude as the primary criterion for selection into élite schools. Greater funds were allocated to education, with the education budget was increased by 17.3% in 1982 and by 15% in 1983. In 1981–82, as a means of tackling cases of education failure, the Ministry of Education subsidized projects designed to help weaker students in 4,500 of the country’s 7,300 secondary schools. Although these subsidies were only of 30million francs, the programme encouraged secondary schools {{to pay attention to the}} problem. They were heaviest in designated priority education and action zones.|$|E
