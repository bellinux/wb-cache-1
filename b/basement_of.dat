5|$|Although much {{is known}} of Little's {{investment}} activities in his adult life, {{little is known about}} his early years. Jacob Little was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts on March 17, 1794. The son of a successful local shipbuilder and of Quaker origin, Little exhibited a strong understanding of money and financial markets from an early age. In 1817 he emigrated to New York City and became a clerk in the store of Jacob Barker, a highly successful financier, merchant, and politically well-connected founding member of the Democratic Party political machine Tammany Hall. Little spent five years in apprenticeship under Barker before moving out in 1822 to start his own business with $700 he had accrued over the length of his employment. He bought a small office in the <b>basement</b> <b>of</b> a Wall Street building, which served as his base of operations for the next twelve years, before moving out of his old office to a new one in the <b>basement</b> <b>of</b> the old exchange building in 1834, from which he opened a brokerage—the start of his investment career.|$|E

40|$|Electron {{microscopic}} {{studies were}} carried out in pursuit of the difference and interrelationship between the changes <b>of</b> the <b>basement</b> membrane <b>of</b> renal glomerulus and the changes <b>of</b> the <b>basement</b> membrane <b>of</b> renal arteriole in experimental hypertension. The changes <b>of</b> the <b>basement</b> membrane <b>of</b> arteriole and <b>basement</b> membrane like material of mesangium and lacis show their occurrence {{at about the same time}} and their progress in the same degree. The changes first observed are the beads-like thickening and reticular change <b>of</b> the <b>basement</b> membrane <b>of</b> vascular wall and also the increase <b>of</b> <b>basement</b> membrane like material in mesangium and lacis. These changes are followed by the deposit of dense material and fibrin on the vascular wall and the increase <b>of</b> <b>basement</b> membrane like material of mesangium and lacis so as to compress their cells and tear them to pieces. About this stage, the thickening <b>of</b> the <b>basement</b> membrane <b>of</b> glomerular capillary loop is intensified and moreover the wrinkle and tortuosity <b>of</b> the <b>basement</b> membrane <b>of</b> glomerular capillary loop and the collapse of glomerular capillary lumen became remarkable. The above findings suggest that the <b>basement</b> membrane <b>of</b> renal arteriole and the basement membrane like material of mesangium and lacis are interrelated, and may be the portions in the kidney most liable to changes and injury in hypertension...|$|R

Today, these walkways are littered with garbage, broken glass, and graffiti. The hospital basements are also infested with rats and bats. In addition, parts of the walkways are flooded with nearly 3 ft of water.|$|R
