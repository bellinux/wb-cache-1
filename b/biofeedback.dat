5|$|Medications may be {{prescribed}} to treat sleep problems and depression. Analgesics such as ibuprofen {{can be taken}} for headache, but paracetamol (acetaminophen) is preferred {{to minimize the risk}} of intracranial hemorrhage. Concussed individuals are advised not to use alcohol or other drugs that have not been approved by a doctor as they can impede healing. Activation database-guided EEG <b>biofeedback</b> has been shown to return the memory abilities of the concussed individual to levels better than the control group.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} research documented intervention {{approach is the}} activation database guided EEG <b>biofeedback</b> approach, which has shown significant improvements in memory abilities of the TBI subject that are far superior than traditional approaches (strategies, computers, medication intervention). Gains of 2.61 standard deviations have been documented. The TBI's auditory memory ability was superior to the control group after the treatment.|$|E
5|$|Avoidance therapy {{consists}} of minimizing or eliminating triggers. For example, {{in those who}} are sensitive to light, using a small television, avoiding video games, or wearing dark glasses may be useful. Operant-based <b>biofeedback</b> based on the EEG waves has some support in {{those who do not}} respond to medications. Psychological methods should not, however, be used to replace medications. Some dogs, commonly referred to as seizure dogs, may help during or after a seizure. It is not clear if dogs have the ability to predict seizures before they occur.|$|E
5|$|Relaxation techniques, such as exercise, yoga or meditation, may {{be useful}} in {{relieving}} the stress that may aggravate tics, but the majority of behavioral interventions (such as relaxation training and <b>biofeedback,</b> with the exception of habit reversal) have not been systematically evaluated and are not empirically supported therapies for Tourette's. Deep brain stimulation has been used to treat adults with severe Tourette's that does not respond to conventional treatment, but it is regarded as an invasive, experimental procedure that is unlikely to become widespread.|$|E
5|$|The third theory {{suggests}} that restricted venous drainage from the brain may be impaired resulting in congestion. Many patients with IIH have narrowing of the transverse sinuses. It {{is not clear whether}} this narrowing is the pathogenesis of the disease or a secondary phenomenon. It has been proposed that a positive <b>biofeedback</b> loop may exist, where raised ICP (intracranial pressure) causes venous narrowing in the transverse sinuses, resulting in venous hypertension (raised venous pressure), decreased CSF resorption via arachnoid granulation and further rise in ICP.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other {{experiments}} were to be performed inside the orbiter crew compartment. Among these was the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System, being flown for the fourth time. This separated solutions of biological materials by passing electric fields through them; the experiment aimed at supporting research into diabetes treatments. A small animal cage was flown containing six rats; no animal experiment was carried out on the flight, but a student involvement project was planned for a later mission which would use the cage, and NASA wanted to ensure it was flight-tested. The student involvement project carried out on STS-8 involved William Thornton using <b>biofeedback</b> techniques, to try {{to determine if they}} worked in microgravity. A photography experiment would attempt to study the spectrum of a luminous atmospheric glow which had been reported around the orbiter, and determine how this interacted with firings of the reaction control system.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the poor}} quality of most studies of {{complementary}} and alternative medicine {{in the treatment of}} cancer pain, {{it is not possible to}} recommend integration of these therapies into the management of cancer pain. There is weak evidence for a modest benefit from hypnosis; studies of massage therapy produced mixed results and none found pain relief after 4 weeks; Reiki, and touch therapy results were inconclusive; acupuncture, the most studied such treatment, has demonstrated no benefit as an adjunct analgesic in cancer pain; the evidence for music therapy is equivocal; and some herbal interventions such as PC-SPES, mistletoe, and saw palmetto are known to be toxic to some people with cancer. The most promising evidence, though still weak, is for mind-body interventions such as <b>biofeedback</b> and relaxation techniques.|$|E
5|$|Hanegraaff {{identified}} the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being holistic health. This {{emerged in the}} 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises {{the idea that the}} human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, {{with some of the most}} common including acupuncture, reiki, <b>biofeedback,</b> chiropractic, yoga, kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age; this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.|$|E
5|$|Randolph Chitwood, a cardiothoracic surgeon with East Carolina, {{performed}} the first minimally invasive robotic-assisted mitral-valve heart {{surgery in the}} United States. East Carolina researchers also developed an electronic fluency device called SpeechEasy; the device is designed to improve the fluency {{of a person who}} stutters by changing the sound of the user's voice in his or her ear. Walter Pories, a faculty member at The Brody School of Medicine developed the standard procedure for gastric bypass surgery. Researchers here also first discovered that 80% of obese/type 2 diabetic patients who underwent this surgical procedure had a reversal of the disease. The <b>Biofeedback</b> Lab is currently developing techniques to help service members recover from posttraumatic stress disorders and traumatic brain injuries they received in Afghanistan and Iraq. The in vitro fertilization program is ranked first in North Carolina and fourth overall in the United States. Jason Bond, a former scientist in the Department of Biology, discovered many new species of spiders, including Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi and Aptostichus stephencolberti.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{findings}} correlating mirror neuron {{activity and}} mu wave suppression in individuals with autism as in typically developing individuals, {{studies have examined}} both the development of mirror neurons and therapeutic means for stimulating the system. A recent study has found that fMRI activation magnitudes in the inferior frontal gyrus increase with age in people with autism. This finding was not apparent in typically developing individuals. Furthermore, greater activation was associated with greater amounts of eye contact and better social functioning. Scientists believe the inferior frontal gyrus {{is one of the}} main neural correlates with the mirror neuron system in humans and is often related to deficits associated with autism. These findings suggest that the mirror neuron system may not be non-functional in individuals with autism, but simply abnormal in its development. This information is significant to the present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror neuron activity in the brain. Other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate the mirror neuron system and suppress mu waves using neurofeedback (a type of <b>biofeedback</b> given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity, in this case EEGs of mu waves). This type of therapy is still in its early phases of implementation for individuals with autism, and has conflicting forecasts for success.|$|E
5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using <b>biofeedback</b> may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on DVD on July 22, 2003. The DVD includes bonus features including an audio commentary, six deleted scenes, three documentaries, two music videos, three trailers, interactive menus and subtitles. The audio commentary presents Ellis, Perry, Bress, and Gruber providing information about {{the making of the}} film and their intentions overall. Deleted scenes are a cross-examination with Isabella's husband Marcus Hudson (Roger Cross), a conversation between Eugene and Nora, a car chase concerning Kimberly's reckless driving, and Eugene's meeting with Death at the hospital, and extended versions of Kimberly's interrogation at the police station and the encounter with Bludworth. The first documentary labelled Bits & Pieces: Bringing Life To Death runs for 30 minutes and recalls the history of splatter film, on top of accounts in relation to the visual effects of the film. The second documentary entitled Cheating Death: Beyond and Back progresses for 18 minutes and brings out people recounting their own real-life experiences with death. The Terror Gauge, the third documentary, is a test screening system of the film in which viewers are subjected to <b>biofeedback</b> and neurological examination under neurophysiologist Dr. Victoria Ibric. Other featurettes of the DVD include the interactive game Choose Your Fate, the music videos of Middle of Nowhere by The Blank Theory and Seven Days a Week by The Sounds, the theatrical trailers of this film and its antecedent, in addition to informative trivias provided throughout the featurettes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biofeedback</b> (the use {{equipment}} to record or amplify and then feed back {{activities of the}} body) is a commonly used and researched treatment, but the benefits are uncertain. <b>Biofeedback</b> therapy varies {{in the way it}} is delivered, but it is unknown if one type has benefits over another.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biofeedback</b> {{is a form}} of {{alternative}} medicine that involves measuring a subject's quantifiable bodily functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, skin temperature, sweat gland activity, and muscle tension, conveying the information to the patient in real-time. This raises the patient's awareness and conscious control of his or her unconscious physiological activities. Neal Miller is generally considered the father of modern-day <b>biofeedback.</b> Miller theorized the basic principles of <b>biofeedback</b> by applying his theory that classical and operant conditioning were both the result of a common learning principle in 1961. Miller hypothesized that any measurable physiological behavior within the human body would respond in some way to voluntary control.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biofeedback</b> {{has been}} used by many {{researchers}} since the 1950s in an effort to enter deeper states of mind.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biofeedback</b> {{therapy for}} facial synkinesis aims to {{increase}} the patient’s awareness of the facial muscle posture and movement. Facial muscles contain few to none intrinsic muscle sensory receptors (used for proprioceptive feedback) and additionally they do not span movable joints and so lack joint receptors (another source for proprioceptive feedback). Thus, <b>biofeedback</b> allows the patient to actively sense the motion of their muscles. The two common forms of <b>biofeedback</b> used are electromyographic feedback and mirror feedback. Electromyographic feedback includes visual EMG signals (coming from facial muscle sites displayed to the patient from a computer {{in the form of}} waveform traces) or auditory signals that indicate strength of muscle contraction. The subsequent role of the patient is to control the movement of undesired muscle during volitional movement by incorporating the information perceived through the EMG. While mirror feedback is a much more basic way of providing the patient feedback on muscle movement, studies have shown that both are very effective options for synkinesis/paresis reduction. <b>Biofeedback</b> is commonly coupled to facial retraining techniques to achieve maximal effectiveness.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{psychotherapy}} approaches {{have been designed}} with the treatment of trauma in mind—EMDR, progressive counting (PC), somatic experiencing, <b>biofeedback,</b> Internal Family Systems Therapy, and sensorimotor psychotherapy.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Nakamura et al. {{has shown that}} <b>biofeedback</b> works better for {{prevention}} of synkinesis as opposed to treatment of synkinesis. Due to the extreme efforts needed to achieve improvements during synkinesis, Nakamura et al. observed that patients will often fail to reach their desired goal {{because of the difficulty}} of maintaining motivation during training. The desired course of action is to catch the patient shortly after facial nerve trauma and teach the patient <b>biofeedback</b> techniques. This course of action has been experimentally proven to significantly reduce the development of synkinesis.|$|E
25|$|Stopping {{straining}} during bowel movements, by use {{of correct}} posture, dietary fiber intake (possibly included bulk forming laxatives such as psyllium), stool softeners (e.g. polyethylene glycol, and <b>biofeedback</b> retraining to coordinate pelvic floor during defecation.|$|E
25|$|Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) have both been used successfully as non-invasive BCIs. In a widely reported experiment, fMRI allowed two users being scanned to play Pong in real-time by altering their haemodynamic response or brain blood flow through <b>biofeedback</b> techniques.|$|E
25|$|Neurofeedback (NF) or EEG <b>biofeedback</b> is a {{treatment}} strategy used for children, adolescents and adults with ADHD. The human brain emits electrical energy which is measured with electrodes. Neurofeedback alerts the patient when beta waves are present. This theory believes {{that those with}} ADHD can train themselves to decrease ADHD symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Music {{may improve}} {{insomnia}} in adults. EEG <b>biofeedback</b> has demonstrated effectiveness {{in the treatment}} of insomnia with improvements in duration as well as quality of sleep. Self-help therapy (defined as a psychological therapy that can be worked through on one's own) may improve sleep quality for adults with insomnia to a small or moderate degree.|$|E
25|$|If the {{phytoplankton}} {{is consumed}} by other {{components of the}} pelagic ecosystem, most of the carbon remains in the upper strata. There is speculation that this process {{is one of the}} largest <b>biofeedback</b> mechanisms of the planet, maybe the most sizable of all, driven by a gigantic biomass. Still more research is needed to quantify the Southern Ocean ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|A further {{parameter}} is {{the method}} of feedback used and this is shown in studies of P300 signals. Patterns of P300 waves are generated involuntarily (stimulus-feedback) when people see something they recognize and may allow BCIs to decode categories of thoughts without training patients first. By contrast, the <b>biofeedback</b> methods described above require learning to control brainwaves so the resulting brain activity can be detected.|$|E
25|$|Non {{surgical}} {{measures to}} treat internal intussusception include pelvic floor retraining, a bulking agent (e.g. psyllium), suppositories or enemas to relieve constipation and straining. If there is incontinence (fecal leakage or more severe FI), or paradoxical contraction of the pelvic floor (anismus), then <b>biofeedback</b> retraining is indicated. Some researchers advise that internal intussusception be managed conservatively, compared to external rectal prolapse which usually requires surgery.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{research}} for treatment has been mostly focused on facial synkinesis {{due to its}} abundant prevalence compared to extra-ocular synkinesis. Additionally, since the extra-ocular muscles are hidden within the orbits, {{there is a limit}} on the type of practical treatments that can be established (e.g. massage). Treatments for synkinesis in general include facial retraining, <b>biofeedback,</b> mime therapy, and Botox and surgery, as a last resort.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence-based}} treatment of conversion disorder. Other treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnosis, EMDR, and psychodynamic psychotherapy, EEG brain <b>biofeedback</b> need further trials. Psychoanalytic treatment may possibly be helpful. However, most studies assessing {{the efficacy of}} these treatments are of poor quality and larger, better controlled studies are urgently needed. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy {{is the most common}} treatment, however boasts a mere 13% improvement rate.|$|E
25|$|Health {{psychology}} {{attempts to}} find treatments to reduce or eliminate pain, as well as understand pain anomalies such as episodic analgesia, causalgia, neuralgia, and phantom limb pain. Although the task of measuring and describing pain has been problematic, {{the development of the}} McGill Pain Questionnaire has helped make progress in this area. Treatments for pain involve patient-administered analgesia, acupuncture (found to be effective in reducing pain for osteoarthritis of the knee), <b>biofeedback,</b> and cognitive behavior therapy.|$|E
25|$|No serious adverse {{side effects}} from neurofeedback have been reported. Research into neurofeedback has been mostly limited and of low quality. While {{there is some}} {{indication}} {{on the effectiveness of}} <b>biofeedback</b> it is not conclusive: several studies have yielded positive results, however the best designed ones have either shown reduced effects or non-existing ones. In general no effects have been found in the most blinded ADHD measures, which could be indicating that positive results are due to the placebo effect.|$|E
25|$|Riggers jump in to {{machines}} {{to control them}} with their mind. While jumped in {{they feel like they}} are the machine, using the vehicle or drone's sensors to replace their own. This allows the rigger to control the machine at Matrix speeds and with greater precision. The downside is if the machine takes damage the rigger {{will have to deal with}} dangerous levels of <b>biofeedback.</b> Likewise the rigger may have to engage in cybercombat with other hackers that are attempting to hijack their devices.|$|E
25|$|This {{investigation}} objectively {{documents the}} functional {{status of the}} sphincters. However, the clinical significance of the findings are disputed by some. It {{may be used to}} assess for pelvic floor dyssenergia, (anismus is a contraindication for certain surgeries, e.g. STARR), and these patients may benefit from post-operative <b>biofeedback</b> therapy. Decreased squeeze and resting pressures are usually the findings, and this may predate the development of the prolapse. Resting tone is usually preserved in patients with mucosal prolapse. In patients with reduced resting pressure, levatorplasty may be combined with prolapse repair to further improve continence.|$|E
25|$|Mind-body therapies {{focus on}} {{interactions}} among the brain, mind, body and behaviour. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine defines the treatments under holistic principle that mind-body are interconnected and through treatment there is improvement in {{psychological and physical}} well-being, and allow patient to have {{an active role in}} their treatment. There are several therapies such as mindfulness, movement therapy (yoga, tai chi), psychological (including CBT) and <b>biofeedback</b> (use of technology to give audio/visual feedback on physiological processes like heart rate). There is only weak evidence that psychological intervention is effective in the treatment of fibromyalgia and no good evidence for the benefit of other mind-body therapies.|$|E
25|$|The Association for Behavior Analysis International {{was founded}} in 1974 and by 2003 had members from 42 countries. The field has been {{especially}} influential in Latin America, where it has a regional organization known as ALAMOC: La Asociación Latinoamericana de Análisis y Modificación del Comportamiento. Behaviorism also gained a strong foothold in Japan, where it {{gave rise to the}} Japanese Society of Animal Psychology (1933), the Japanese Association of Special Education (1963), the Japanese Society of <b>Biofeedback</b> Research (1973), the Japanese Association for Behavior Therapy (1976), the Japanese Association for Behavior Analysis (1979), and the Japanese Association for Behavioral Science Research (1994). Today the field of behaviorism is also commonly referred to as behavior modification or behavior analysis.|$|E
25|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} anal sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, inducing muscle contraction without traditional exercises (similar to transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, TENS). The evidence supporting its use is limited, and any benefit is tentative. In light of the above, intra-anal electrical stimulation (using an anal probe as electrode) appears to be more efficacious than intra-vaginal (using a vaginal probe as electrode). Rarely, skin reactions may occur where the electrodes are placed, but these issues typically resolve when the stimulation is stopped. Surgically implanted sacral nerve stimulation may be more effective than exercises, and electrical stimulation and <b>biofeedback</b> may be more effective than exercises or electrical stimulation by themselves. TENS is also sometimes used to treat FI by transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation.|$|E
25|$|John Henry Irons tests Jimmy's powers using metahuman <b>biofeedback,</b> but {{the display}} generates {{complicated}} {{images of the}} Source Wall and alternate Earths. On his way home, Jimmy meets two members of Cadmus, who offer their assistance, take him back to their HQ, and run tests on him. Jimmy's powers go haywire, and he runs off to keep himself from hurting anyone. He encounters the Newsboy Legion, who offer him shelter. Jimmy encounters Forager, who asks for help in stopping {{the killing of the}} New Gods. On Apokolips, Jimmy and Forager fight Parademons and are overpowered and taken prisoner. The Monitors decide that Jimmy is not meant to control his powers and that he is being manipulated. Jimmy is sent to the slave pits, where his overseers are ordered to torture him; Mister Miracle comes to his aid. Unable to discern the nature of Jimmy's powers with his Mother Box, Mister Miracle gambles by dropping Olsen into a fire pit. Jimmy survives by assuming a turtle-like form. Jimmy locates Forager, who then attacks him. Jimmy duplicates the powers of a Mother Box to restore Forager's sanity. When the two of them are confronted by Bernadeth, Jimmy manages to open a Boom Tube and returns to Earth with Forager, whereupon he kisses her.|$|E
