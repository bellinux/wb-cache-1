2500|$|In January 2004, Robertson {{said that}} God told him President Bush will be re-elected in a [...] "blowout" [...] in November. [...] "I think George <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> {{to win in}} a walk", Robertson told viewers of his The 700 Club program. [...] "I really believe I'm hearing from the Lord it's {{going to be like}} a blowout {{election}} in 2004. It's shaping up that way." [...] Bush did in fact win re-election, but not in a landslide. The 2004 race between Bush and John Kerry was one of the closest large elections in history.|$|E
5000|$|John Gibson, {{the former}} host of an {{afternoon}} hour of news coverage called The Big Story, was cited {{as an example}} of Fox News blurring the lines between objective reporting and opinion/editorial programming. Gibson caused a general rampage among listeners immediately after the 2000 presidential election controversy when, during the opinion segment of his show, Gibson said: [...] "Is this a case where knowing the facts actually would be worse than not knowing? I mean, should we burn these ballots, preserve them in amber, or shred them?" [...] and [...] "George <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be president. And who needs to know that he's not a legitimate president?" [...] In an opinion piece on the Hutton Inquiry decision, Gibson said the BBC had [...] "a frothing-at-the-mouth anti-Americanism that was obsessive, irrational and dishonest" [...] and that the BBC reporter, Andrew Gilligan, [...] "insisted on air that the Iraqi Army was heroically repulsing an incompetent American Military." [...] In reviewing viewer complaints, Ofcom (the United Kingdom's statutory broadcasting regulator) ruled that Fox News had breached the program code in three areas: [...] "respect for truth", [...] "opportunity to take part", and [...] "personal opinions expressed (in an opinion slot) must not rest upon false evidence." [...] Fox News admitted that Gilligan had not actually said the words that John Gibson appeared to attribute to him; Ofcom rejected the claim that it was intended to be a paraphrase. (See.) Gibson has also called Joe Wilson a [...] "liar", claimed that [...] "the far left" [...] is working for Al Qaeda and stated that he wished that Paris had been host to the 2012 Olympic Games, because it would have subjected the city to the threat of terrorism instead of London.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we tried to}} predict what a {{candidate}} in a political debate (namely George W. <b>Bush)</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to say, {{based on what the}} moderator and the other candidate just said. In order to achieve that, we first used PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, and then applied several regression models in order to do the actual predictions. While the PCA turned up some interesting patterns, the best test error (in a complex enough model) we achieved was about 70 %. I...|$|E

He made references to [...] "goddamn immigrants" [...] in Canada during his speech. During a question-and-answer session following his lecture, Ahenakew said that Jews were a disease in Germany and that Hitler was trying to [...] "clean up Europe" [...] when he [...] "fried six million of those guys." [...] He also stated that Israel and the United States (specifically mentioning George W. <b>Bush)</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to start the next world war.|$|R
500|$|The {{album was}} {{initially}} scheduled to feature Dan Nelson on vocals. However, following the events later that year, {{he was no}} longer a member of the band. When asked {{what would happen to the}} completed studio album featuring Nelson's vocals, Ian said: [...] "Until we have a new singer, I can't tell you what will happen to the record. We'll probably change a few things on it, including the vocals." [...] Ian also indicated that the album's release could be delayed until 2010. It was assumed that John <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to record new vocals for the album after his reunion with the band. However, this did not happen. In an interview at the time, <b>Bush</b> said he <b>was</b> trying to re-record vocals for some of the songs that had already been recorded.|$|R
50|$|The {{exit polls}} showed that <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> the <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> the clear {{winner of the}} state, {{based on the fact}} that both Bush won among both genders. A major key factor was how 55% of the people thought the state economy was good, and 70% of those people voted for Bush. Also, 55% of the state {{approved}} of Bush.|$|R

50|$|The first National Climate Assessment was {{prepared}} over several years. ExxonMobil {{did not participate}} in public consultations, but on August 10, 2000, ran an advertisement in the Washington Post raising various objections to a draft. The report was delivered to Congress in November 2000. The incoming George W. Bush administration appointed moderate Republican Christine Todd Whitman as chair of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and American Petroleum Institute lobbyist Philip Cooney as {{chief of staff of the}} Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). During the campaign, Bush had promised to cap carbon dioxide emissions. Shortly after the inauguration Ebell heard a rumor that <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to repeat the pledge in a speech. Ebell contacted Robert Novak who was due to interview Whitman, and Novak questioned her on CNN's Crossfire. It became a hot topic, and CEI circulated it to anyone with influence. Bush dropped the pledge, and in March withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol.|$|R

The video, attributed to the Sunni insurgent group Islamic Army in Iraq, showed American soldiers being shot and falling to the ground. The video starts with a man saying, [...] "I have nine bullets in this gun and I have a present for George <b>Bush.</b> I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to kill nine Soldiers.

Leight said [...] "I’d say, you know, this - we were aware last year there were - there’s a spate of comics getting a lot of attention for rape-jokes. And obviously there was the Tosh incident, was I think one of the more public and egregious incidents in which he decided wouldn’t it be funny if he - someone was heckling him and he got into it with her. And said wouldn’t it be funny if you were - if these guys gang raped you right here? And, you know, at SVU we don’t think that’s funny. And then there was Dane Cook had certain jokes." ...|$|R

[...] According to Adam Goldman and Matt Apuzzo, of the Associated Press, Intelligence officials who insisted on anonymity asserted that the double agent program had successful graduates -- individuals who were believed to be trustworthy enough to be released early, and who would then betray terrorists. However, they acknowledged {{that at least some of}} those individuals defected, and stopped reporting back to the CIA. In anticipation of the United States Supreme Court's ruling in Rasul v. <b>Bush,</b> which <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to allow access to habeas corpus for individuals held in Guantanamo, Penny Lane, and other CIA black sites, like Camp Strawberry Fields, were shut down.|$|R

5000|$|Kerry {{was criticized}} by Howard Dean {{and others for}} his {{position}} on the war, which was criticized as inconsistent. Kerry explained his vote authorizing force by claiming that he believed the Senate resolution was intended to be a diplomatic [...] "threat" [...] to Saddam Hussein and not a blank check for war. In the first of the 2004 U.S. presidential election debates, Kerry argued that Saddam Hussein had posed a significant potential threat, but that President <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> premature in <b>going</b> to war. Kerry stated that war should have been a last resort, after diplomatic pressure and efforts by United Nations weapons inspectors had been allowed to run their course.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 47). Since the legislative branch is responsible for policy-making, the president's success at passing policy depends on his ability to persuade Congress. Because congressmen are responsive to their constituents, one of the ways presidents can persuade Congress is by obtaining public support. In attempts to obtain support, presidents make appeals to the American public, otherwise known as "going public. " These appeals began with Theodore Roosevelt's administration and have been employed more frequently with each successive president. However, the effectiveness of "going public" is highly speculative. In this study, I examined four issues about which President Bush went public: the Persian Gulf Crisis, War on Drugs, North American Free Trade Agreement, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1990. I determined how successful <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> at <b>going</b> public by comparing the frequency of his appeals to changes in public opinion. The results show that the president's attempts to change public opinion were relatively unsuccessful, except when he addressed the nation as a whole...|$|R

60|$|It {{does not}} follow, however, {{that there are}} many novelle which, if they were duly padded, would be found novelettes. In that dim, {{subjective}} region where the aesthetic origins present themselves almost with the authority of inspirations there is nothing clearer than the difference between the short-story motive and the long-story motive. One, if one is in that line of work, feels instinctively just the size and carrying power of the given motive. Or, if the reader prefers a different figure, the mind which the seed has been dropped into from Somewhere is mystically aware whether the seed <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to grow up a <b>bush</b> or <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to grow up a tree, if left to itself. Of course, the mind to which the seed is intrusted may play it false, and wilfully dwarf the growth, or force it to unnatural dimensions; but the critical observer will easily detect the fact of such treasons. Almost in the first germinal impulse the inventive mind forefeels the ultimate difference and recognizes the essential simplicity or complexity of the motive. There will be a prophetic subdivision into a variety of motives and a multiplication of characters and incidents and situations; or the original motive will be divined indivisible, {{and there will be a}} small group of people immediately interested and controlled by a single, or predominant, fact. The uninspired may contend that this is bosh, and I own that something might be said for their contention, but upon the whole I think it is gospel.|$|R

At this point, McCunn's diary indicated his hope that his family or friends would send someone to look for him after he failed to return. McCunn had sent three maps with his campsite marked to some friends and his father, but was not clear about his exact itinerary. Although his father {{knew he would be}} in the area, he did not know when McCunn planned on returning. McCunn had also told his father not to be concerned if he did not return {{at the end of the}} summer, as he might stay later in the season if things went well.|$|R
25|$|I believe President <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> running {{deficits in}} Washington very deliberately.
