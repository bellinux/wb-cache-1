In his famous Hadith on Talbinah, the Prophet Mohammad (SAW) recommended it when sad events happen for {{its effect on}} soothing hearts and relieving sadness. This 3 -week crossover designed, randomized clinical trial was conducted {{to determine the effect}} of Talbinah on mood and depression among institutionalized elderly people in Seremban. A sample of 30 depressed elderly subjects (21 men and 9 women) was selected from the long term care facility. Three different interview-based validated scales (Geriatric Depression Scale, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, and Profile of Mood States) were used to determine mood, depression, stress, and anxiety at week 0, 3, 4, and 7. The nutritional value of Talbinah was examined using proximate food analysis, minerals content analysis, and differential amino acid analysis. The results indicated that Talbinah is a high carbohydrate food (86. 4 %) and has a high tryptophan: branch chain amino acids ratio (1 : 2). A Wilcoxon nonparametric test showed that there was a statistically significant decrease on depression, stress, and mood disturbances scores among the intervention group (P &lt; 0. 05) for all parameters. In conclusion, Talbinah has the potential to reduce depression and enhance mood among the subjects. Ingestion of functional foods such as Talbinah may provide a mental health benefit to elderly people. Keywords: Talbinah, food and depression, cross over study, elderl...|$|E

40|$|The {{separation}} {{performance of}} a semicontinuous counter-current chromatographic refiner (SCCR 7), consisting of twelve 5. 4 cm id x 75 cm long columns packed with calcium charged cross-linked polysytrene resin (KORELA VO 7 C), was optimised. An industrial <b>barley</b> <b>syrup</b> was used containing 42 % fructose, 52 % glucose and 6 % maltose and oligosaccharides. The effects of temperature, flow rates and concentration on the distribution coefficients were evaluated and quantified by deriving general relationships. The effects of flow rates, feed composition and concentration on the separation performance of the SCCR 7 were identified and general relationships {{between them and the}} switch time, which was found to be the controlling parameter, were developed. Fructose rich (FRP) and glucose rich (GRP) product purities of 99. 9 % were obtained at 18. 6 % w/v feed concentrations. When a 66 % w/v feed concentration was used and product splitting technique was employed, the throughput was 32. 1 kg sugar solids/m 3 resin/hr. The GRP contained less than 4. 5 % fructose, the FRP was over 95 % pure, and the respective concentrations were 22. 56 and 11. 29 % w/v. Over 94 % of the glucose and 95. 78 % of the fructose in the feed were recovered in the GRP and FRP respectively. By recycling the dilute product split fractions, the GRP and FRP concentrations were increased to 25. 4 and 12. 96 % w/v; the FRP was 90. 2 % pure and the GRP contained 6. 69 % w/v fructose. A theoretical link between batch and semicontinuous chromatographic equipments has been determined. A computer simulation was developed predicting successfully the purging concentration profiles at `pseudo-equilibrium', and also certain system design parameters. An important further aspect of the work has been to study the behaviour of chromatographic bioreactor-separators. Such batch systems of 5. 4 cm id and lengths varying between 30 and 230 cm, were used to investigate the effect of scaling up on the conversion of sucrose into dextran and fructose {{in the presence of the}} dextransucrase enzyme. Conversions of over 80 % were achieved at 4 hr sucrose residence times. The crude dextransucrase was purified using centrifugation, ultrafiltration and cross-flow microfiltration techniques. Better enzyme stability was obtained by first separating the non-solid impurities using cross-flow microfiltration, and then removing the cells from the enzyme immediately before use by continuous centrifugation...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Barley</b> malt <b>syrup</b> is an {{unrefined}} sweetener {{processed by}} extraction from sprouted i.e., malted barley, containing approximately 65 percent maltose, 30 percent complex carbohydrate, 3% protein. Malt syrup is dark brown, thick and sticky, and possesses a strong distinctive flavor described as [...] "malty." [...] It {{is about half}} as sweet as refined white sugar. <b>Barley</b> malt <b>syrup</b> is sometimes used {{in combination with other}} natural sweeteners to lend a malt flavor.|$|R

25|$|At {{its most}} basic, {{traditional}} bagel dough contains wheat flour (without germ or bran), salt, water, and yeast leavening.

Most bagel recipes call for {{the addition of a}} sweetener to the dough, often <b>barley</b> malt (<b>syrup</b> or crystals), honey, high fructose corn syrup, sugar, with or without eggs, milk or butter. Leavening can be accomplished using a sourdough technique or a commercially produced yeast.|$|R

50|$|Nahalin was {{incorporated}} into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1596 Nahalin appeared in the tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Quds of the Liwa of Quds.

They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33,3 % on agricultural products, including wheat, <b>barley,</b> grape <b>syrup</b> or molasses, and goats or beehives; a total of 3,880 Akçe. Historically, Nahalin was frequented by Bedouin and was well known for its tradition of beekeeping.|$|R
5000|$|Malt beer is a sweet, {{low-alcohol beer}} (0%-2.5% ABV) that is brewed like regular beer but with low or minimal {{fermentation}}. To keep the alcohol content low, {{one of two}} methods may be used: either the yeast is added at about 0 °C (resulting in an alcohol content of under 0.5% ABV) or fermentation is halted at the desired alcohol content (usually {{in the range of}} 1 to 2% ABV). It is made from <b>barley</b> malt <b>syrup,</b> sugar, yeast, hops, and water. [...] Malt beer is considered to be nutritious and is sometimes given to nursing mothers.|$|R

According to the bottle, it should be consumed within one year of purchase. The website claims it has about as many calories as an orange juice; in fact, at 43 kcal per 100 ml, it is about on par with both alcoholic lager and most soft drinks with added sugar.The company recommends it for young people and pregnant women because of its nutritional value. Unfortunately, no information on said value can be found, {{other than the fact}} that it contains several B-Vitamins which support the metabolism and that it gives lots of energy to the body.|$|R
