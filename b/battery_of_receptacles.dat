40|$|The role of auxin in {{ripening}} strawberry (Fragaria ×ananassa) fruits {{has been}} {{restricted to the}} early stages of development where the growth <b>of</b> the <b>receptacle</b> is dependent on the delivery of auxin from the achenes. At later stages, during enlargement <b>of</b> the <b>receptacle,</b> other hormones have been demonstrated to participate to different degrees, from the general involvement of gibberellins and abscisic acid to the more specific of ethylene. Here we report the involvement of auxin at the late stages <b>of</b> <b>receptacle</b> ripening. The auxin content <b>of</b> the <b>receptacle</b> remains constant during ripening. Analysis of the transcriptome of ripening strawberry fruit revealed the changing expression pattern of the genes of auxin synthesis, perception, signaling and transport along with achene and receptacle development from the green to red stage. Specific members of the corresponding gene families show active transcription in the ripe receptacle. For the synthesis of auxin, two genes encoding tryptophan aminotransferases, FaTAA 1 and FaTAR 2, were expressed in the red receptacle, with FaTAR 2 expression peaking at this stage. Transient silencing of this gene in ripening receptacle was accompanied by a diminished responsiveness to auxin. The auxin activity in the ripening receptacle is supported by the DR 5 -directed expression of a GUS reporter gene in the ripening <b>receptacle</b> <b>of</b> DR 5 -GUS transgenic strawberry plants. Clustering by co-expression of members of the FaAux/IAA and FaARF families identified five members whose transcriptional activity was increased with the onset <b>of</b> <b>receptacle</b> ripening. Among these, FaAux/IAA 11 and FaARF 6 a appeared, by their expression level and fold-change, as the most likely candidates for their involvement in the auxin activity in the ripening <b>receptacle.</b> The association <b>of</b> the corresponding ARF 6 gene in Arabidopsis to cell elongation constitutes a suggestive hypothesis for FaARF 6 a involvement in the same cellular process in the growing and ripening receptacle...|$|R

40|$|Ocean {{warming and}} {{acidification}} may substantially affect {{the reproduction of}} keystone species such as Fucus vesiculosus (Phaeophyceae). In four consecutive benthic mesocosm experiments, we compared the reproductive biology and quantified the temporal development of Baltic Sea Fucus fertility under the single and combined impact of elevated seawater temperature and pCO 2 (1100 ppm). In an additional experiment, we investigated the impact of temperature (0 – 25 °C) on the maturation of North Sea F. vesiculosus receptacles. A marked seasonal reproductive cycle of F. vesiculosus became apparent {{in the course of}} 1 year. The first appearance <b>of</b> <b>receptacles</b> on vegetative apices and the further development <b>of</b> immature <b>receptacles</b> <b>of</b> F. vesiculosus in autumn were unaffected by warming or elevated pCO 2. During winter, elevated pCO 2 in both ambient and warmed temperatures increased the proportion <b>of</b> mature <b>receptacles</b> significantly. In spring, warming and, to a lesser extent, elevated pCO 2 accelerated the maturation <b>of</b> <b>receptacles</b> and advanced the release of gametes by up to 2 weeks. Likewise, in the laboratory, maturation and gamete release were accelerated at 15 – 25 °C relative to colder temperatures. In summary, elevated pCO 2 and/or warming do not influence receptacle appearance in autumn, but do accelerate the maturation process during spring, resulting in earlier gamete release. Temperature and, to a much lesser extent, pCO 2 affect the temporal development of Fucus fertility. Thus, rising temperatures will mainly shift or disturb the phenology of F. vesiculosus in spring and summer, which may alter and/or hamper its ecological functions in shallow coastal ecosystems of the Baltic Sea...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of a temperature gradient on the maturation <b>of</b> fertile <b>receptacles</b> <b>of</b> Fucus vesiculosus. Samples collected from the North Sea at Sylt were cultivated at six different Temperatures (0 °C – 25 °C) over a period of five weeks. All other abiotic factors like light intensity, salinity and nutrient supply were kept constant. The number of conceptacles producing the gametes (eggs and sperms) mainly characterize the reproduction of this alga. The conceptacles are developed on the surface <b>of</b> the <b>receptacles</b> therefore their number and size are important parameters of the reproduction process. To investigate this in detail the following relationships were studied: • Receptacle growth and development with respect to the different temperatures • Number of conceptacles with respect to the different temperatures • Correlations between number <b>of</b> conceptacles and <b>receptacle</b> size It was shown that temperature has a significant influence on the maturation <b>of</b> the <b>receptacles.</b> The optimal reproduction temperature is in the range of 5 °C – 15 °C, where receptacles become biggest and develop the most conceptacles. Correlations between the number of conceptacles and the receptacle size were found. The number of conceptacles increases during maturation and is related to the growth <b>of</b> the <b>receptacles.</b> The description <b>of</b> this dependency with a linear model was not very accurate. But since it was shown that an increase in length, width, thickness and area <b>of</b> the <b>receptacles</b> is related to an increase of the number of conceptacles, these parameters could be used as derived parameters to determine the maturation level in the temperature range of 5 °C – 15 °C also in field studies...|$|R
