40|$|The article studies {{fixed coupon}} {{securities}} (bonds). It provides a {{calculation of the}} cash flow, generated by fixed coupon securities, with enclosed discounted face value of securities. It analyses time indicator – average weighted duration of payments, which characterises sensitivity {{of the price of}} securities to changes of interest rates in the market. It proves availability of two groups of interconnections between the cost of a <b>bond,</b> <b>coupon</b> rate, market rate (rate of return) and term of its payment. The first group of interconnections reflects interconnections between the cost of a <b>bond,</b> <b>coupon</b> rate and market rate (rate of return). The second group characterises connection between the bond cost and term of its payment. The authors study the average weighted duration of payments. It {{plays an important role in}} analysis of long-term securities with fixed income. To simplify calculations it was accepted that the coupon payment is done once a year. The article offers a formula for identifying inaccuracy of the bond price depending on the expected change of profitability on payment. Analysing duration properties the article identifies shortcomings inherent in this indicator. Taking into account the average weighted duration of payments the article recommends a formula, as more efficient, for identification of the future bond price depending on change of profitability. The conducted studies are a theoretical ground for development of models of management of fixed income securities portfolios. The obtained scientific results could be used in the educational process both in colleges and specialised trainings of securities specialists.

40|$|A bond is a {{debt capital}} market {{instrument}} issued by a borrower, who is then required to repay to the lender/investor the amount borrowed plus interest at maturity, and {{also known as}} fixed-income securities, and therefore the bond is an attractive investment in the financial sector.

40|$|A key {{measure of}} {{relative}} {{value of a}} corporate bond is its swap spread. This is the basis point spread over the interest-rate swap curve, and {{is a measure of}} the credit risk of the bond. In its simplest form, the swap spread can be measured as the difference between the yield-to-maturity of the bond and the interest rate given by a straight-line interpolation of the swap curve. In practice traders use the asset-swap spread and the Z-spread as the main measures of relative value. The government bond spread is also considered. We consider the two main spread measures in this paper. Asset-swap spread An asset swap is a package that combines an interest-rate swap with a cash bond, the effect of the combined package being to transform the interest-rate basis of the bond. Typically, a fixed-rate bond will be combined with an interest-rate swap in which the bond holder pays fixed coupon and received floating coupon. The floating-coupon will be a spread over Libor (see Choudhry et al 2001). This spread is the asset-swap spread and is a function of the credit risk of the bond over and above interbank credit risk. 1 Asset swaps may be transacted at par or at the bond’s market price, usually par. This means that the asset swap value is made up of the difference between the bond’s market price and par, as well as the difference between the <b>bond</b> <b>coupon</b> and the swap fixed rate. The zero-coupon curve is used in the asset swap valuation. This curve is derived from the swap curve, so it is the implied zero-coupon curve. The asset swap spread is the spread that equates the difference between the present value of the bond’s cashflows, calculated using the swap zero rates, and the market price of the bond. This spread is a function of the bond’s market price and yield, its cashflows and the implied zero-coupon interest rates. 2 Exhibit 1 shows the Bloomberg screen ASW for a GBP-denominated bond, GK...|$|E
