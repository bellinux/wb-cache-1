5|$|Heavy atom methods (multiple {{isomorphous}} replacement)– If electron-dense metal atoms can <b>be</b> <b>introduced</b> {{into the}} crystal, direct methods or Patterson-space methods {{can be used}} to determine their location and to obtain initial phases. Such heavy atoms can <b>be</b> <b>introduced</b> either by soaking the crystal in a heavy atom-containing solution, or by co-crystallization (growing the crystals {{in the presence of a}} heavy atom). As in MAD phasing, the changes in the scattering amplitudes can be interpreted to yield the phases. Although this is the original method by which protein crystal structures were solved, it has largely been superseded by MAD phasing with selenomethionine.|$|E

5|$|Interior Minister Anne Holmlund, who {{had ordered}} the {{original}} investigation into the police officers' conduct in the Kauhajoki incident, said that legislation would <b>be</b> <b>introduced</b> to aid police officers in accessing information about the {{mental and physical health}} of applicants for firearms licenses.

In addition to this, Holmlund said that the referencing process for being granted a firearms license would be intensified: two referees would have to be personally interviewed before a license was granted. Holmlund also pointed to legislation of the EU as her starting point.
