40|$|The {{service sector}} {{in the world economy}} is growing and becomes {{increasingly}} important. It is widely recognised that the success and vitality of the service sector are the essential factors in measuring an economy’s progress, its quality and its future. Improving service quality is therefore considered an essential strategy for success and survival in today’s competitive economic environment. Small businesses are equally important for a country’s economy. They {{play an important role in}} the economic and social development of countries. The correct location for small businesses can contribute to their success and, many consider shopping centres as a good location for their businesses. The landlords however, have a huge impact on small business tenants’ success in shopping centres. Although landlords of shopping centres realise the importance of accommodating small independent businesses in their centres, it is argued that they are at a competitive disadvantage regarding the service they receive in comparison with that of bigger anchor tenants. There are several research studies on the measurement of service quality in several service sectors, but none has addressed the quality of service rendered by landlords of shopping centres to their small <b>business</b> <b>tenants.</b> The purpose of this study is to measure the perceived service quality that small <b>business</b> <b>tenants</b> in shopping centres receive from landlords. The study will also determine whether the existing SERVPERF and FAIRSERV service quality models will be suitable to measure the service quality that landlords render to small <b>business</b> <b>tenants.</b> The findings of the empirical study have revealed that small <b>business</b> <b>tenants</b> in shopping centres are in general dissatisfied with the service that they receive from their landlords. Factor analysis was done to determine the factors or dimensions of service quality that small <b>business</b> <b>tenants</b> deemed as important. From this study it became clear that small <b>business</b> <b>tenants</b> in shopping centres are concerned about mainly two aspects of the service they receive from landlords, namely intangible aspects as well as marketing and tangible aspects. This study has therefore proved that the five dimensions of SERVPERF and the one dimension of FAIRSERV cannot be applied directly to measure the perceived service quality that small <b>business</b> <b>tenants</b> receive from their landlords. The One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was also executed to illustrate statistical differences between various variables. The contribution of this study to the science, as well as its possible limitations and areas for future research, is also discussed. This study further shows that, although small <b>business</b> <b>tenants</b> are dissatisfied with the service they receive from landlords, they have indicated that they will stay on as tenants in the centres. The reason for this is that it is simply too expensive for them to move to another location and also because shopping centres are good locations for their businesses.

50|$|In some jurisdictions, {{the tenant}} has a {{legal right to}} remain in {{occupation}} of the premises {{after the end of}} a lease unless the landlord complies with a formal process to dispossess the tenant of the property. For example, in England & Wales, a <b>business</b> <b>tenant</b> has a right to continue occupying their demise after the end of their lease under the provisions of sections 24-28 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (unless these provisions were formally excluded by agreement before the lease was completed). At the end of their lease they need do nothing but continue payment of rent at the previous level and uphold all other relevant covenants such as to keep the building in good repair. They cannot be evicted unless the landlord serves a formal notice to end the tenancy and successfully opposes the grant of the new lease to which the tenant has an automatic right. Even this can only be done under prescribed circumstances, for example the landlord's desire to occupy the premises himself or to demolish and redevelop the building.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, 58-year-old Jim Fergesson {{decides to}} sell his Oakland-based auto repair {{business}} and retire. This threatens to greatly inconvenience his <b>business</b> <b>tenant,</b> used car salesman Al Miller, who rents a lot from Fergesson {{to sell his}} battered but superficially reconditioned old jalopies. Chris Harmon, an entrepreneur, advises Fergesson {{to invest in a}} new super-garage located in Marin Country Gardens. Jim takes a fall in the mud and has a minor heart attack during a visit to the property to personally verify its existence. Miller is convinced that Harmon is corrupt and makes an amateurish attempt at blackmailing him over his alleged (then-illegal) sale of salacious audio recordings. At the same time Al enters employment with Harmon as a curiously unqualified salesman of Classical Music. This, as it turns out, was an innocent administrative error. Al's actual assignment now involves the mass marketing of Barbershop Music. He sees conspiracies, machinations and double-dealings where there are none and strives mightily, but ultimately fails, to disrupt the final contract-signing between Fergesson and Harmon by playing on old Jim's paranoia. The strain of it all takes its toll on a recently injured, weakened, ailing Fergesson and he dies later that night at home.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} the {{findings}} relating to small business tenants {{of a major}} UK Government funded study into the commercial and industrial property landlord and tenant relationship. The UK Government is concerned that small business tenants do not appreciate many {{of the implications of}} signing leases, which in the UK are generally longer than in most other countries of the world. The objectives of the paper are to identify the characteristics of leases in the UK and any differences between those signed by small, medium and larger companies. It also examines the negotiation process and identifies whether small <b>business</b> <b>tenant</b> negotiations exhibit different characteristics. The findings are that small business tenants occupy on different terms to larger tenants including shorter terms and that the negotiation process is also different. Many small business tenants are unrepresented at the commercial stage of negotiations and take the first terms on offer. They are largely unaware of attempts to make them more informed by voluntary industry Codes of Practice. This can lead to small business tenants being unaware of the implications of certain terms within leases, hence the continuing Government concern over the issue. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the commercial leases policy {{issue of how}} to deal with small <b>business</b> <b>tenants.</b> The UK has adopted a voluntary solution to commercial lease reform by using Codes of Practice which is in contrast to the legislative approach adopted by Australia to attempt to solve its perceived problems with small business retail tenancies. The aim of the research was to examine the perceptions of the effectiveness of the legislation in Australia and discuss any implications for the UK policy debate. The research used a combination of literature and legislation review and a semi structured interview survey to investigate the policy aims and objectives of Australian Federal and State Governments, identify the nature and scope of the Australian legislation and examine perceptions of effectiveness of the legislation in informing small <b>business</b> <b>tenants.</b> The situation is complicated in Australia due to leases being a State rather than Federal responsibility therefore the main fieldwork was carried out in one case study State, Victoria. The paper concludes that some aspects of the Australian system can inform the UK policy debate including mandatory information provision at the commencement of negotiations and the use of lease registrars/commissioners. However, {{there are a number of}} issues that the Australian legislation does not appear to have successfully addressed including the difficulties of legislating across partial segments of the commercial property market and the collection of data for enforcement purposes. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the framework for}} commercial lease negotiations in Australia and the UK. The paper discusses the different approaches to lease negotiations in the different countries and specifically {{examines the}} process by which small <b>business</b> <b>tenants</b> negotiate leases in the UK. This paper uses a combination of literature review and survey evidence and finds that in some States in Australia legislation was proposed after a voluntary code had not worked and now all States have a legislative framework. In the UK the Government has relied upon voluntary codes of practice but has decided that the awareness of small <b>business</b> <b>tenants</b> concerning the implications of some lease clauses is still poor. This conclusion is based on the findings of this research which concludes that small businesses in the UK have very different negotiation processes than medium sized enterprises and larger corporate occupiers. Despite being less experienced in taking leases, {{they are less likely to}} take professional advice, more likely to take the first lease offered and are less likely to know about the existence of the code of practice. However, they do tend to occupy on shorter leases than larger tenants which have a lower incidence of upwards only ratcheted rent reviews. The voluntary code of practice is having little direct effect on UK practice. However, the literature review gives no indication that any research work has been undertaken on the relative success of the legislative option adopted in Australia and therefore this remains as a major research questio...|$|R
