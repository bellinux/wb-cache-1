50|$|In physics, quantum beats {{are simple}} {{examples}} of phenomena that cannot be described by semiclassical theory, {{but can be}} described by fully quantized calculation, especially quantum electrodynamics. In semiclassical theory (SCT), there is an interference or <b>beat</b> <b>note</b> term for both V-type and -type atoms. However, in the quantum electrodynamic (QED) calculation, V-type atoms have a beat term but -types do not. This is strong {{evidence in support of}} quantum electrodynamics.|$|E
5000|$|Assume {{that the}} loop power supply is {{initially}} switched {{off and then}} at [...] the power is switched on, and assume that the initial frequency difference is sufficiently large. The loop may not lock within one <b>beat</b> <b>note,</b> but the VCO frequency will be slowly tuned toward the reference frequency (acquisition process). This effect is also called a transient stability. The pull-in range is used to name such frequency deviations that make the acquisition process possible (see, e.g. explanations in p. 40, p. 61).|$|E
5000|$|Gongs produce two {{distinct}} types of sound. A gong with a substantially flat surface vibrates in multiple modes, giving a [...] "crash" [...] {{rather than a}} tuned note. This category of gong is sometimes called a tam-tam to distinguish it from the bossed gongs that give a tuned note. In Indonesian gamelan ensembles, some bossed gongs are deliberately made to generate in addition a <b>beat</b> <b>note</b> {{in the range from}} about 1 to 5 Hz.

5000|$|After the {{returning}} waves are received, a signal with a frequency equal to {{this difference is}} created by mixing the received radio signal with {{a little of the}} transmitted signal. Just as two different musical notes played together create a <b>beat</b> <b>note</b> at the difference in frequency between them, so these two radio signals are mixed to create a [...] "beat" [...] signal (called a heterodyne) and an electrical circuit then measures this frequency using a digital counter and displays the number on a digital display as the object's speed.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{frequency}} domain, a pulse train {{is represented by}} a frequency comb. Here, the carrier-envelope frequency [...] is exactly the offset frequency of the pulse train, cf. figure. This {{makes it possible to}} perform a multi-shot measurement of the CEP, for example by using an f-2f interferometer. Here, the pulses to be measured are broadened to a bandwidth of at least one octave. A long-wavelength part of the pulse is frequency doubled and the <b>beat</b> <b>note</b> between it and the short-wavelength part of the fundamental pulse is measured. This is better known as the offset phase.|$|E
50|$|In Indonesian gamelan ensembles, {{instruments}} that are organologically gongs come in various sizes with different functions and different names.

The gong ageng and some gong suwukan have a <b>beat</b> <b>note.</b>|$|E

The method {{is based on the}} measurement of the <b>beat</b> <b>notes</b> obtained by filtering pairs of adjacent longitudinal laser modes in a high-resolution, zero-dispersion grating-lens spectroscope arrangement.

5000|$|A {{second problem}} was that the {{multiple}} radio frequency stages, all tuned to the same frequency, were prone to oscillate, and the parasitic oscillations mixed with the radio station's carrier in the detector, producing audible heterodynes (<b>beat</b> <b>notes),</b> whistles and moans, in the speaker. [...] This was solved by the invention of the Neutrodyne circuit (below) and the development of the tetrode later around 1930, and better shielding between stages.|$|R
5000|$|In the superheterodyne, {{the radio}} {{frequency}} signal from the antenna is shifted down to a lower [...] "intermediate frequency" [...] (IF), before it is processed. [...] The incoming {{radio frequency signal}} from the antenna is mixed with an unmodulated signal generated by a local oscillator (LO) in the receiver. The mixing is done in a nonlinear circuit called the [...] "mixer". The result at {{the output of the}} mixer is a heterodyne or beat frequency at the difference between these two frequencies. The process is similar to the way two musical notes at different frequencies played together produce a <b>beat</b> <b>note.</b> This lower frequency is called the intermediate frequency (IF). The IF signal also has all the information that was present in the original RF signal. The IF signal passes through filter and amplifier stages, then is demodulated in a detector, recoveirng the original modulation.|$|E
5000|$|Compared to {{many other}} musical instruments, the Great Highland bagpipe is limited by its range (nine notes), lack of dynamics, and the {{enforced}} legato style, due to the continuous airflow from the bag. The Great Highland bagpipe is a closed reed instrument, {{which means that the}} four reeds are completely encased within the instrument and the player cannot change the sound of the instrument via mouth position or tonguing. As a result, notes cannot be separated by simply stopping blowing or tonguing, so grace notes and combinations of grace notes, called [...] "embellishments", are used for this purpose. These are more complicated ornaments using two or more grace notes include doublings, taorluaths, throws, grips, and birls. There are also a set of ornaments usually used for pìobaireachd, for example the dare, vedare, chedare, darado, taorluath and crunluath. Some of these embellishments have found their way into light music {{over the course of the}} 20th century. These embellishments are also used for note emphasis, for example to emphasize the <b>beat</b> <b>note</b> or other phrasing patterns. These three single grace notes (G, D, and E) are the most commonly used and are often played in succession. All grace notes are performed rapidly, by quick finger movements, giving an effect similar to tonguing or articulation on modern wind instruments. Due to the lack of rests and dynamics, all expression in Great Highland bagpipe music comes from the use of embellishments and to a larger degree by varying the duration of notes. Despite the fact that most Great Highland bagpipe music is highly rhythmically regimented and structured, proper phrasing of all types of Great Highland bagpipe music relies heavily on the ability of the player to stretch specific notes within a phrase or measure. In particular, the main beats and off-beats of each phrase are structured. However, sub-divisions within each beat are flexible.|$|E

40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{for measuring}} the relative stability of two signals is disclosed comprising a means for mixing the two signals down to a <b>beat</b> <b>note</b> sine wave and for producing a <b>beat</b> <b>note</b> square wave whose upcrossings {{are the same as}} the sine wave. A source of reference frequency is supplied to a clock divider and interval counter to synchronize them and to generate a picket fence for providing a time reference grid of period shorter than the beat period. An interval counter is employed to make a preliminary measurement between successive upcrossings of the <b>beat</b> <b>note</b> square wave for providing an approximate time interval therebetween as a reference. The <b>beat</b> <b>note</b> square wave and the picket fence are then provided to the interval counter to provide an output consisting of the time difference between the upcrossing of each <b>beat</b> <b>note</b> square wave cycle and the next picket fence pulse such that the counter is ready for each upcrossing and dead time is avoided.

40|$|Dual-comb {{spectroscopy}} utilizes {{two sets}} of comb lines with slightly different comb-tooth-spacings, and optical spectral information is acquired by measuring the radio-frequency <b>beat</b> <b>notes</b> between the sets of comb lines. It holds the promise as a real-time, high-resolution analytical spectroscopy tool {{for a range of}} applications. However, the stringent requirement on the coherence between comb lines from two separate lasers and the sophisticated control system to achieve that have confined the technology to the top metrology laboratories. By replacing control electronics with an all-optical dual-comb lasing scheme, a simplified dual-comb spectroscopy scheme is demonstrated using just one dual-wavelength, passively mode-locked fiber laser. Dual-comb pulses with a repetition-frequency difference determined by the intracavity dispersion are shown to be sufficiently stable against common-mode cavity drifts and noises. As sufficiently low relative linewidth is maintained between {{two sets of}} comb lines, capability to resolve RF <b>beat</b> <b>notes</b> between comb teeth and picometer-wide optical spectral features is demonstrated using a simple data acquisition and processing system in an all-fiber setup.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{was an attempt to}} {{investigate}} musicians ' tempo note preferences within a musical context. Using relatively familiar orchestral music as stimuli, the study tested the ability of subjects to discriminate how an altered excerpt differed in tempo from its unaltered presentation by asking subjects to select a <b>beat</b> <b>note</b> for each trial. One hundred randomly selected subjects participated in the study. A representative list of eight relatively familiar orchestral works was specifically selected because of the ambiguity of the perceived rhythmic organization, that is, either in oneness (dotted note as <b>beat</b> <b>note)</b> or in threeness (undotted note as <b>beat</b> <b>note),</b> regardless of the actual notation. Subjects heard each of the eight excerpts three times, at increased, decreased, and unaltered tempi. The amount of tempo change in either direction was 12 %.
