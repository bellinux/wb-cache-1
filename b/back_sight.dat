6000|$|Edgar {{showed him}} how this was done, and the sheik then {{repeatedly}} loaded and unloaded the gun {{until he could}} manipulate it quickly. [...] "And what is this thing?" [...] he asked, touching the <b>back</b> <b>sight.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{few days}} ago we were shown {{one of a number}} of rifles {{furnished}} at the C. S. Armory here. It is much the same in general appearance, as the U.S. rifle for some years made at Harper’s Ferry and at Springfield, Mass.; but for certain improvements, in the matter of sword bayonet, Maynard primer, and perfection of finish in all parts, it must be pronounced very superior. The <b>back</b> <b>sights</b> are set for 800 and 500 yards.|$|R

5000|$|In tournaments, {{compound}} archers usually equip their bows with a sighting system, {{consisting of}} a [...] "peep sight" [...] held within the bowstring {{that acts as a}} <b>back</b> <b>sight,</b> and a front sight attached to the bow handle. Some front sights are magnifying and/or adjustable for targets at different distances. Some sights have multiple [...] "pins" [...] set up for targets at different distances.|$|E
50|$|The {{breech block}} was {{confined}} within a flat-sided frame with {{a bridge to}} carry the <b>back</b> <b>sight</b> and arrest the upper section of the slide. The recoil spring surrounded the barrel, enclosed in the frame and held by a collar engaging {{the front end of}} the slide through a spring catch. Pulling back on the finger grips at the front of the slide brings the breech block into view behind the frame.|$|E

50|$|In {{the absence}} of wind, the bombsight problem is fairly simple. The impact point is a {{function}} of three factors, the aircraft's altitude, its forward speed, and the terminal velocity of the bomb. In many early bombsights, the first two inputs were adjusted by separately setting the front and <b>back</b> <b>sights</b> of an iron sight, one for the altitude and the other for the speed. Terminal velocity, which extends the fall time, can be accounted for by raising the effective altitude by an amount that is based on the bomb's measured ballistics.|$|R

50|$|In December 1978, {{he became}} a co-founder and {{chairman}} of Seva Foundation, an international, non-profit, health foundation. Seva's projects in places like Tibet, Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Guatemala have given <b>back</b> <b>sight</b> to more than 3 million blind people through surgery, self-sufficient eye care systems, and low cost manufacturing of intraocular lenses. One important contribution of his was his helping {{to set up the}} Aravind Eye Hospital in Madurai, India.|$|E
50|$|Fixed {{front and}} <b>back</b> <b>sight</b> that cannot be {{adjusted}} produced some {{criticism from the}} users. The magazine well was designed to accept the direct copy of Uzi magazine. This type of dual stack, dual feed type magazine {{is considered one of}} the improvements this gun has in comparison to the original STEN gun or similar ones that used dual stack, single feed magazines, that are often more prone to jamming and harder to load. The butt stock shape was apparently influenced by another similar gun of World War II vintage, the Grease Gun.|$|E
50|$|The {{heart of}} the TRG system is its {{receiver}} that houses a single stroke pneumatic power system that is operated by the users muscle power with a side mounted cocking lever. While the cocking lever is pulled back a constant volume of surrounding air rushes through air intake holes into the cylinder. During this operation the trigger is also cocked. On pushing the cocking lever back forward the air is compressed by a piston to a constant much smaller volume in a compression chamber. This results in an operating pressure of about 60 to 70 bar.The hinge mechanism that connects the cocking lever to the air cylinder piston protrudes out of the rifle {{at the rear of}} the air cylinder under the <b>back</b> <b>sight.</b> The lever sports a large synthetic bulbous knob that provides a firm grip when cocking the rifle.The early LGR rifles had a reputation under smaller framed persons for being physically strenuous to cock during extended training and match sessions compared to the Feinwerkbau 300 match air rifles. This problem was addressed by improving the cocking system, though the improved Walther LGR still required more effort to cock compared to the Feinwerkbau 300 series.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, damn--you! No!" [...] cried Kells, in hoarse, broken fury. With {{both hands}} before him {{he seemed to}} push <b>back</b> the <b>sight</b> of that gold, of Gulden, of the {{malignant}} men, of a horrible temptation.|$|R

50|$|The PYa is a high-capacity, double-action, short-recoil {{semi-automatic}} pistol. Barrel/slide locking is {{a simplified}} Colt-Browning design, {{similar to that}} found in many modern pistols (for example the SIG Sauer and Glock families of pistols); the breech end of the barrel is rectangular in shape, rather than rounded, and fits into matching locking grooves within the slide, near the ejection port. The slide stop lever can be mounted {{on either side of}} the weapon to accommodate both left- and right-handed users. Likewise, the manual safety is ambidextrous, with safety catches on both sides of the weapon, where it is manipulated by the thumb. It is mounted on the frame, below the rear slide grooves, and directly behind the slide stop lever. The hammer is partially concealed at the sides to prevent catching on clothes and equipment. The magazine release catch is located in the base of the trigger guard on the left side, where it can be manipulated with the thumb (right-handed users) or index or middle finger (left-handed users). The front sight is formed as a fixed part of the slide and is non-adjustable. The <b>back</b> <b>sight</b> is drift adjustable for windage (dovetail type), but this requires a tool. Both feature white contrast elements to ease aiming in low-light conditions. The standard magazine capacity is 17 rounds, fed from a double-column, single feed magazine. Magazines with an 18 round capacity were produced after 2004.|$|E

50|$|The most {{prominent}} {{features of the}} APS-95 over the Galil and the R4 were its distinctive handguard and front sight, and its carrying handle integrating an 1.5× optical sight and optional backup <b>back</b> iron <b>sights.</b> The pistol grip was also different, featuring finger grooves, much {{in the style of}} the M16 rifle.|$|R

And the elder man went pale, and his reddish eyebrows twitched. He gave his order, barrenly.|$|R
