5|$|Natural {{enemies of}} insect pests, {{also known as}} <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> agents, include predators, parasitoids, pathogens, and competitors. <b>Biological</b> <b>control</b> agents of plant {{diseases}} are most {{often referred to as}} antagonists. <b>Biological</b> <b>control</b> agents of weeds include seed predators, herbivores and plant pathogens.|$|E
5|$|<b>Biological</b> <b>control</b> {{is first}} {{recorded}} around 300 AD in China, when colonies of weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina, were intentionally placed in citrus plantations to control beetles and caterpillars. Also in China, ducks {{were used in}} paddy fields to consume pests, as illustrated in ancient cave art. In 1762, an Indian mynah was brought to Mauritius to control locusts, and about the same time, citrus trees in Burma were connected by bamboos to allow ants to pass between them and help control caterpillars. In the 1880s, ladybirds were used in citrus plantations in California to control scale insects, and other <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> experiments followed. The introduction of DDT, a cheap and effective compound, put an effective stop to <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> experiments. By the 1960s, problems of resistance to chemicals and damage to the environment began to emerge, and <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> had a renaissance. Chemical pest control is still the predominant type of pest control today, although {{a renewed interest in}} traditional and biological pest control developed {{towards the end of the}} 20th century and continues to this day.|$|E

5|$|<b>Biological</b> <b>control</b> {{can have}} {{side-effects}} on biodiversity through attacks on non-target species {{by any of}} the same mechanisms, especially when a species is introduced without thorough understanding of the possible consequences.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} ways to manage diseases including cultural, chemical, and <b>biological</b> <b>controls.</b> Some of these controls are more effective than others, however, the best approach to a managing any disease, including Microdochium Patch, is an integrated approach called Integrated Pest Management or IPM. IPM uses a combination of chemical, cultural and <b>biological</b> <b>controls</b> to reduce spending on pesticides and to decrease pesticide resistance. The following {{are some of the most}} important cultural controls used in managing Microdochium Patch.|$|R

50|$|The Sterile insect {{technique}} (SIT) is an Area-Wide IPM {{program that}} introduces sterile male pests into the pest population to trick females into (unsuccessful) breeding encounters, providing {{a form of}} birth control and reducing reproduction rates. The <b>biological</b> <b>controls</b> mentioned above only appropriate in extreme cases, because in {{the introduction of new}} species, or supplementation of naturally occurring species can have detrimental ecosystem effects. <b>Biological</b> <b>controls</b> can be used to stop invasive species or pests, but they can become an introduction path for new pests.|$|R
5|$|<b>Biological</b> <b>control</b> {{techniques}} {{as we know}} them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the USA, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites Tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight the grapevine phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid Cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, {{but by the end of}} 1889 the cottony cushion scale population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{pest control}} is a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. Classical <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> involves the introduction of natural enemies of the pest that are bred in the laboratory and released into the environment. An alternative approach is to augment the natural enemies that occur {{in a particular area}} by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. <b>Biological</b> <b>control</b> can be an important component of an integrated pest management programme.|$|E
5|$|Importation or {{classical}} <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> {{involves the}} introduction of a pest's natural enemies to a new locale where they do not occur naturally. Early instances were often unofficial and not based on research, and some introduced species became serious pests themselves.|$|E

5|$|In 1905 the USDA {{initiated}} {{its first}} large-scale <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> program, sending entomologists to Europe and Japan {{to look for}} natural enemies of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar dispar, and brown-tail moth, Euproctis chrysorrhoea, invasive pests of trees and shrubs. As a result, nine parasitoids (solitary wasps) of gypsy moth, seven of brown-tail moth, and two predators of both moths became established in the USA. Although the gypsy moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies, the frequency, duration, and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful. This program also {{led to the development}} of many concepts, principles, and procedures for the implementation of <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> programs.|$|E

25|$|Although certain control {{methods are}} {{effective}} on other root-feeding arthropods, control measures for sugarbeet root aphids are more difficult. Crop rotation and simple foliar and postemergence insecticides are usually ineffective. However, Knox Out 2FM and Counter 15G {{have proven to}} be effective in containing infestations, although some states, such as California, currently have no chemicals registered for use on the sugarbeet root aphid. <b>Biological</b> <b>controls,</b> such as introduction of fungal diseases or natural predators, may also serve as an effective means of pest control. Although it is unlikely that <b>biological</b> <b>controls</b> are fully capable of controlling sugarbeet root aphid populations, future research may increase their role in management.|$|R
25|$|The parasitoids used {{to control}} the borer beetle are Hymenoptera (wasps) native to Africa. Although they have a low impact in the beetle population, the use of <b>biological</b> <b>controls</b> allows the product to qualify as organic food.|$|R
50|$|In addition, USDA's Risk Management Agency has {{initiated}} education and outreach to low-income farmers regarding use of <b>biological</b> <b>controls,</b> rather than pesticides, for pest control, efforts {{that the agency}} believes are valuable {{in the face of}} climate change.|$|R

40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract is unique {{when compared to}} other organs of the body because is in direct contact with the external environment and continuously exposed to antigens derived from foods and the enteric flora. To provide a balanced response (homeostasis) to these massive antigenic challenges and still allow the selective absorption of essential nutrients, the intestine has developed a series of powerful defense mechanisms that comprise both physical and <b>biological</b> <b>controls.</b> Physical controls include peristalsis, mucus secretion, and an uninterrupted monolayer of epithelial cells regulated by tight junctions. <b>Biological</b> <b>controls</b> include secretion of antibacterial molecules like defensins, lactoferrin, and lysozyme, trafficking of immune cells {{in and out of the}} gut, and a highly specialized immunological system that utilizes both innate and adaptive immune components.

5|$|Bacteria {{used for}} <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> infect insects via their {{digestive}} tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used for <b>biological</b> <b>control,</b> with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.|$|E
