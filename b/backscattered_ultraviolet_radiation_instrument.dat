40|$|The Solar <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (SBUV/TOMS) onboard the Nimbus 7 {{satellite}} is an {{atmospheric ozone}} measuring experiment from solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> off the earth atmosphere. The excellent spatial coverage and long lifetime of SUBV/TOMS makes this experiment viable {{for the long}} term monitoring of the global ozone. A technique used in the in-orbit calibration of SUBV/TOMS for the ozone data processing is presented. This technique employs a model to explain and correct the observed instrument output due to degradation. From the analyses with the corrected data to verify the model, it is concluded that the in-orbit instrument calibration for the ozone measurement is accurate within 2 percent for the first four years of the instrument operation...|$|R
40|$|Results of a {{simulation}} {{study on the}} effects of optically thick stratospheric sulfate aerosol layers on the <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> (buv) in the range 256 - 340 nm are presented. In general, the increased Mie scattering produced by the aerosols results in an enhancement of the buv radiation. The increase is approximately linear with optical depth and strongly depends on solar zenith angle and aerosol layer altitude in relation to the ozone maximum. The effect is greatest at those wavelenghts whose contribution functions peak {{in the vicinity of the}} densest part of the aerosol layer. The aerosol induced perturbation of the buv field affects the ozone profile retrieval from space measurements by the Solar <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> Experiment (SBUV) experiment. In the tropical stratosphere, the retrieved ozone between 25 and 45 km is underestimated as a result of increased Mie scattering. On the other hand, an algorithm related effect causes the retrieved ozone below 25 km to be overestimated by an amount similar to the stratospheric deficit...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} tropospheric {{aerosols}} on the retrieval of column ozone amounts using spaceborne measurements of <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> is examined. Using radiative transfer calculations, {{we show that}} uv-absorbing desert dust may introduce errors as large as 10 % in ozone column amount, depending on the aerosol layer height and optical depth. Smaller errors are produced by carbonaceous aerosols that result from biomass burning. Though the error is produced by complex interactions between ozone absorption (both stratospheric and tropospheric), aerosol scattering, and aerosol absorption, a surprisingly simple correction procedure reduces the error to about 1 %, {{for a variety of}} aerosols and {{for a wide range of}} aerosol loading. Comparison of the corrected TOMS data with operational data indicates that though the zonal mean total ozone derived from TOMS are not significantly affected by these errors, localized affects in the tropics can be large enough to seriously affect the studies of tropospheric ozone that are currently undergoing using the TOMS data...|$|R

This method uses jointly the usual analytical and Monte Carlo methods. Effects of the lower boundary of the atmosphere, cloud tops, and ground surface are investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. The ratio of multiple to single scattering is determined, and its importance in ozone profile inversion of backscattered UV solar radiation from the terrestrial atmosphere is evaluated. The polarization of the atmospheric radiance is treated briefly...|$|R
40|$|New {{methods to}} {{quantify}} the aerosol optical properties have been developed. These properties have important influences on UV radiation. By combining spectral irradiance and radiance measurements, the effective single scat-tering albedo and optical depth of aerosols can be derived with reasonable accuracy at locations with moderate to high aerosol optical depth. Under low aerosol conditions, accurate determination of the wavelength dependence of the aerosol optical depth in the UV-B is restricted by calibration uncertainties and by the interference of ozone and SO 2. • Although the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instrument is no longer available, continuity of satellite-derived global UV data is maintained. The new Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) onboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Observing System (EOS) Aura spacecraft was launched in July 2004 for continued global monitoring of ozone, other trace gases, and surface UV irradiance. • Tropospheric aerosols {{are responsible for the}} overestimation of UV irradiance from satellite instruments (e. g., TOMS) that use solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> to derive surface UV irradiance. Although at clean sites the agreement with ground-based measurements is good, over more polluted locations the bias can be as large as 40 % because the lowermost atmosphere containing the absorbing aerosols is not adequately probed. The presence of clouds, and snow or ice cover, can also lead to significant biases. New algorithms have been develope...|$|R

40|$|Observations of <b>backscattered</b> near <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> {{from the}} Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer {{on board the}} Nimbus 7 (1979 - 1992) and the Earth-Probe (mid- 1996 to present) {{satellites}} {{have been used to}} derive a long-term record of aerosol optical depth over oceans and continents. The retrieval technique applied to the TOMS data makes use of two unique advantages of near-UV remote sensing not available in the visible or near IR: 1) low reflectivity of all land surface types (including the normally bright deserts in the visible), that makes possible aerosol retrieval over the continents, and, 2) large sensitivity to aerosol types that absorb in the UV, allowing the clear separation of carbonaceous and mineral aerosols from purely scattering particles such as sulfate and sea salt aerosols. The near-UV method of aerosol characterization is validated by comparison with AERONET ground based observations. TOMS retrievals of aerosol optical depth over land areas (1996 - 2000), are shown to agree reasonably well with AERONET sunphotometer observations for a variety of environments characterized by different aerosol types, such as carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning, desert dust aerosols, and sulfate aerosols. In most cases the TOMS derived optical depths of UV absorbing aerosols are within 30 % of the AERONET observations, while non-absorbing optical depths agree to within 20 %...|$|R

40|$|The role of aerosol {{absorption}} on the {{radiative transfer}} {{balance of the}} earth-atmosphere system {{is one of the}} largest sources of uncertainty in the analysis of global climate change. Global measurements of aerosol single scattering albedo are, therefore, necessary to properly assess the radiative forcing effect of aerosols. Remote sensing of aerosol absorption is currently carried out using both ground (Aerosol Robotic Network) and space (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) based observations. The satellite technique uses measurements of <b>backscattered</b> near <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation.</b> Carbonaceous aerosols, resulting from the combustion of biomass, are one of the most predominant absorbing aerosol types in the atmosphere. In this presentation, TOMS and AERONET retrievals of single scattering albedo of carbonaceous aerosols, are compared for different environmental conditions: agriculture related biomass burning in South America and Africa and peat fires in Eastern Europe. The AERONET and TOMS derived aerosol absorption information are in good quantitative agreement. The most absorbing smoke is detected over the African Savanna. Aerosol absorption over the Brazilian rain forest is less absorbing. Absorption by aerosol particles resulting from peat fires in Eastern Europe is weaker than the absorption measured in Africa and South America. This analysis shows that the near UV satellite method of aerosol absorption characterization has the sensitivity to distinguish different levels of aerosol absorption. The analysis of the combined AERONET-TOMS observations shows a high degree of synergy between satellite and ground based observations...|$|R
40|$|An {{iterative}} {{method of estimating}} total atmospheric O₃ and SO₂ is developed for currently available satellite measurements of <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (uv) <b>radiation.</b> This method utilizes a direct inversion of the equation of radiative transfer by using a first order Taylor expansion of this equation {{with respect to a}} guessed combination of total O₃ and total SO₂. A new guess is made so as to minimize the difference between the measurements and theoretically calculated values. This method is able to model an atmosphere with molecular scattering or one with scattering by both molecules and particulates. A sensitivity analysis is presented and, {{in the case of a}} molecular atmosphere, the errors in retrieved total O₃ are on the order of 20 % and for total SO₂ are 25 %. Estimates can be performed for an atmosphere containing both molecular scatters and particulate scatters for scattering angles of 110 °- 150 °. In the case of volcanic ash and SO₂ mixed within the stratospheric eruption cloud, retrieval errors for these angles are within the same range as those of the molecular only atmosphere if: the index of refraction of the ash is known to within a factor of 1. 5 and the mean radius is also known to within a factor of 2. Application of this method to total ozone measuring spectrometer (TOMS) Nimbus 7 data for scans of a volcanic cloud show the total O₃ amount within the cloud to be noticeably lower than those of positions out of the cloud. This is consistent with the results of others...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} for determining cloud-top height {{by means of}} <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (BUV) solar <b>radiation</b> is presented. Cloud-top heights can be inferred using this technique of both the BUV radiance and its degree of polarization are measured by a spacecraft and compared with theoretical values. The cases of satellites with high-inclination orbits and geosynchronous satellites are discussed here. Based on calculations of radiance and polarization, the resolutions of cloud-top height determinations are roughly estimated in both cases. The estimates show that inference is possible {{as long as the}} angle between the direction of the sun and the satellite from the point of interest in the atmosphere is larger than about 10 deg. The estimates also indicate that the cloud-top-height resolution depends on solar zenith angle theta(0) in the case of nadir observation by satellites in nonequatorial orbits: The resolution is about 0. 5 km for theta(0) = 30 and about 0. 3 km for larger theta(0). On the other hand, when observations are made by geosynchronous satellites, the resolution depends strongly on the latitude of the point of interest, alpha(1); a resolution within 0. 4 km can be achieved for alpha(1) {{less than or equal to}} 65 deg (0. 2 km resolution can be obtained for middle latitudes). Resolution becomes rapidly worse with increasing latitude, and alpha(1) = about 70 deg seems to be the limit of observations with this technique...|$|R

40|$|This study {{applies the}} concept of a budget to {{describe}} the interaction of solar <b>ultraviolet</b> (UV) <b>radiation</b> with the earth-atmosphere system. The wavelength ranges of interest are the biologically relevant UV-B between 280 and 320 nm and the UV-A from 32000 to 400 nm. The Nimbus 7 solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (SBUV) instrument provides measurements of total column ozone and information concerning cloud cover which, in combination with a simple model of radiation transfer, define the fractions of incident solar irradiance absorbed in the atmosphere, reflected to space, and absorbed at the ground. Results for the month of July quantify the contribution of fractional cloud cover and cloud optical thickness to the radiation budget's three components. Scattering within a thick cloud layer makes the downward radiation field at the cloud base more isotropic than is the case for clear skies. For small solar zenith angles, typical of summer midday conditions, the effective pathlength of this diffuse irradiance through tropospheric ozone is greater than that under clear-sky conditions. The result is an enhanced absorption of UV-B radiation in the troposphere during cloud-covered conditions. Major changes in global cloud cover or cloud optical thicknesses could alter the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> received by the biosphere by an amount comparable to that predicted for long-term trends in ozone...|$|R
