5|$|In the 1994 {{campaign}} season, in {{an effort}} to offer an alternative to Democratic policies and to unite distant wings of the Republican Party, Gingrich and several other Republicans came up with a Contract with America, which laid out ten policies that Republicans promised to bring to a vote on the House floor during the first hundred days of the new Congress, if they won the election. The contract was signed by Gingrich and other Republican candidates for the House of Representatives. The contract ranged from issues such as welfare reform, term limits, tougher crime laws, and a balanced <b>budget</b> <b>law,</b> to more specialized legislation such as restrictions on American military participation in United Nations missions.|$|E
5|$|Meeting on {{the third}} day of the special session, Democratic factions within the General Assembly reached a {{compromise}} budget. That tentative budget proposed an increase in the state sales tax from 6% to 7%, which was estimated to generate an additional $1.1 billion in revenue. The plan also included a requirement to use half of that for direct relief toward New Jersey's property tax—highest of all states. The plan also called for the same dedicated purpose for all of the money raised by this sales tax increase in subsequent years. The new <b>budget</b> <b>law</b> included a provision for a constitutional amendment which was required, like all such amendments in the state, to be approved in an Election Day referendum. On November 7, 2006, New Jersey voters approved this measure by a two to one margin statewide.|$|E

40|$|Virtually {{unknown in}} Canada before the 1990 s, {{balanced}} budget legislation has suddenly become popular across the country. The author examines the wide diversity of mechanisms {{being used to}} limit state fiscal powers, including spending caps, anti-deficit rules, and tax referenda. Evaluating these measures, the author raises concerns {{about the impact of}} balanced <b>budget</b> <b>laws</b> on economic stability, social justice, and political democracy. She warns against discounting either their instrumental effects or their power to shape public finance discourse. Though some provinces have adopted less severe versions, the author concludes that these efforts only partially mitigate the dangers of balanced <b>budget</b> <b>laws...</b>|$|R

25|$|One of {{the first}} successes of the Hohenwart {{ministry}} was {{the passing of the}} <b>Budget</b> <b>Law</b> of 1871. After this, Hohenwart dissolved the Parliament in Vienna and provincial diets. Hohenwart then called for the election of new diets. Hohenwart dissolved the diets because he had enough influence on big Estate owners to secure the election of federalist Conservatives. Also, the Hohenwart ministry enfranchised districts which would elect federalist Conservatives. With the dissolving of Parliament and the solidifying of political support, the stage was set {{for the development of a}} Federalist agreement.|$|E

The economics and public finance literature provides little explanation as to why <b>budget</b> system <b>laws</b> differ so widely across countries. Comparative law studies are more promising, particularly those relating to the hierarchy of law. The differences in {{the relative importance of}} the constitution, statutes and regulations provide some explanation as to why countries’ budget-related laws are so different. However, there is no theory to explain why the relative weight of each of these sources of law differs across countries. Political variables are also important, particularly the past and present forms of government. The degree of separation of powers between the executive and the legislature partly explains the extent to which law is used for specifying budget processes and actors. ...|$|R

In the committee's first meeting, he called for Lebanon's economic system to be reformed, saying that [...] "it is outdated. The Taef Agreement did not meet the requirements needed." [...] During the summer of 2010, Nahas raised a number of objections in cabinet meetings to the draft <b>budget</b> <b>law</b> that was proposed by Finance Minister Raya Haffar al-Hassan. In particular, he objected to what he described as the proposed law's failure to address Lebanon's basic economic difficulties (which manifested themselves in the form of high unemployment and emigration) at a time of relatively favorable circumstances (including a spectacular increase in capital in-flows since 2008). Nahas proposed a number of changes to the draft <b>budget</b> <b>law</b> that would reduce the burdens on employment and on income, as well as increased investment in a modern public transport system in Lebanon. He has also insisted on a number of methodological changes, including the elimination of all off-balance sheet expenses. The draft <b>budget</b> <b>law</b> was eventually approved by the Cabinet, including by Nahas, on 19 June 2010.
