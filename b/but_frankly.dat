500|$|In {{conversation}} with Woods, Biko {{insisted that the}} BCM would not degenerate into anti-white racism [...] "because it isn't a negative, hating thing. It's a positive black self-confidence thing involving no hatred of anyone". He acknowledged that a [...] "fringe element" [...] may retain [...] "anti-white bitterness"; he added: [...] "we'll {{do what we can}} to restrain that, <b>but</b> <b>frankly</b> it's not one of our top priorities or one of our major concerns. Our main concern is the liberation of the blacks." [...] Elsewhere, Biko argued that it was the responsibility of a vanguard movement to ensure that, in a post-apartheid society, the black majority would not seek vengeance upon the white minority. He stated that this would require an education of the black population in order to teach them how to live in a non-racial society.|$|E
500|$|In September 1926, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Wynter gave {{a lecture}} to the United Services Institute of Victoria {{entitled}} [...] "The Strategical Inter-relationship of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force: an Australian View", {{which was published}} in the April 1927 edition of British Army Quarterly. In this article Wynter argued that war was most likely to break out in the Pacific at a time when Britain was involved in a crisis in Europe, which would prevent Britain from sending sufficient resources to Singapore. He contended that Singapore was vulnerable, especially to attack from the land and the air, and argued for a more balanced policy of building up the Army and RAAF rather than relying on the RAN. [...] "Henceforward", wrote Australian official historian Lionel Wigmore, [...] "the attitude of the leading thinkers in the Australian Army towards British assurances that an adequate fleet would be sent to Singapore at the critical time was (bluntly stated): 'We do not doubt that you are sincere in your beliefs <b>but,</b> <b>frankly,</b> we do not think {{you will be able to}} do it.|$|E
500|$|Jim Abott of Orlando Sentinel {{classified}} [...] "the sweetly melodic old-school" [...] song among Jackson's [...] "occasional {{bursts of}} inspiration," [...] declaring it [...] "a beautifully big arrangement that's Motown-esque." [...] Additionally, its [...] "depth and sweetness" [...] was considered unexpected by Dan LeRoy from The Scene, commenting [...] "West's swaying '50s pastiche [...] "I Want You" [...] is delightful". Richard Cromelin of the Los Angeles Times exclaimed the track [...] "has a swooning charm, with a chimes-studded texture that suggests the sweeping light-points of a disco ball." [...] Mikael Wood of Baltimore City Paper gave a similar critique, saying the [...] "luscious slow jam" [...] ultimately [...] "shimmers with the sweet lovesickness Karen Carpenter {{had to fight}} through a scrim of suburban sang-froid to express." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared the song [...] "on the slower side", containing [...] "a verse that's memorable." [...] Plugged In observed subtle sexuality within its lyrics, commenting that Jackson is insatiable. The song's production from West also received acclaim. Music critic Kevin Nottingham ranked it as West's second best production, classifying it as a [...] "gorgeous piece of work." [...] He exclaimed. [...] "The drums hit {{at the beginning and}} the listener should already fall in love. Janet's voice should intrigue you, <b>but</b> <b>frankly,</b> those strings and those drums grab my attention all the time." [...] Nottingham added that West's beat takes the listener on a joyful ride, while the beat evokes happiness.|$|E

500|$|The Day the Earth Stood Still: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was orchestrated and {{conducted}} by Timothy Williams. Tyler Bates {{was brought in}} to compose the score for The Day the Earth Stood Still after Derrickson heard his work on The Devil's Rejects and Slither. Instead of imitating the original score by Bernard Herrmann, Bates decided to try to convey the updated message of the new film, and he assumed that most people would not even realize it was a remake. Bates said, [...] "People revere an original property and feel that it's sacred, <b>but</b> <b>frankly,</b> there's a good story to be retold, as it applies to the climate of the world now. If that's something beyond the scope of a person's ability to take in, on a new level, without necessarily using the original as a criteria for whether or not they're going to enjoy it, then they probably shouldn't bother themselves with it." [...] The origins for the sound on the new score came from Bates attending the filming of a few scenes with Reeves and Smith. When he got back to L.A., he created a sound loop on his GuitarViol to which Derrickson responded, [...] "I think that's the score!", when it was played for him. Bates utilized the theremin, which Herrmann heavily used for the original film's score. Bates and the theremin player he hired used the instrument in a manner reminiscent of a sound effect, especially during Klaatu's surgery. A short segment from Bach's Goldberg Variations is heard playing in the background of the Professor's home when Klaatu visits the Professor which {{was not included in the}} film's accompanying soundtrack release.|$|E

Hu encouraged intellectuals to raise controversial subjects in the media, including democracy, human rights, and the possibility of introducing legal limits to the Communist Party's influence within the Chinese government.

2500|$|Variety {{called the}} film [...] "one {{of the great}} {{cinematic}} achievements of the 1970s." [...] Gene Siskel of The Chicago Tribune also wrote that the film [...] "truly tests a film critic's power of description ... Some critics have complained that the Days of Heaven story is too slight. I suppose it is, <b>but,</b> <b>frankly,</b> you don't think about it while the movie is playing". Time magazine's Frank Rich wrote, [...] "Days of Heaven is lush with brilliant images". The periodical went on to name {{it one of the}} best films of 1978. Nick Schager of Slant Magazine has called it [...] "the greatest film ever made." ...|$|E
