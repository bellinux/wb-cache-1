At the {{stage of the}} RF heating the moisture contents decreased clearly at the internal parts of timbers. The surface stress of the sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D.

However, the increase of the area and the width of the surface checks in the Link 3 were comparatively low, and the quality of these <b>boxed</b> <b>heart</b> timbers seemed relatively good.

30|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of pretreatment with high temperature and low humidity (HT-LH) on characteristics of radio-frequency/vacuum (RF/V) drying of <b>boxed</b> <b>heart</b> timber of Japanese cedar (150 × 150 mm in cross section, 3600 mm long). From green to approximately 15 % moisture content, the drying times including HT-LH treatment were 170 h for the nonkerfed control, 190 h for the kerfed control, and 150 h for both the kerfed and nonkerfed HT-LH specimens. Surface checks were effectively prevented by the HT-LH treatment while the kerfed HT-LH specimens were free from surface checks. In order to prevent the formation of internal checking during RF/V drying, {{it is suggested that}} HT-LH treatment should finish around the fiber saturation point.|$|E

40|$|Bending {{tests were}} {{performed}} on full scale structural lumber sawed frm sugi(Cryptomeria japonica D. Don.) logs grown in Oita orefecture, {{and the relationship between}} the wood 2 ̆ 7 s strength performance and material factors, as well as the variation of Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus in the wood in its transformation from log to lumber were examined. The ersults are summarized as follows. (1) The mean value of MOE (A) (modulus of elasticity corrected by the standard testing condition) and MOR(A) (modulus of repture correcetd by the standard testing condition) of the sugi square-cut lumber were 7. 86 kN/mm 2 and 40. 3 N/mm 2, respectively. On the ither hand the mean value of MOE(A) and MOE(A) of the sugi rectangular-cut lumber were 8. 12 kN/m 2 and 47. 7 N/mm 2, respectively. The MOE(A) values in both sugi lumber were above the value of standard strength of non graded lumber of established by the Ministry of Construction notice. (2) In the relationship between material factors and strength performance,MOE(A) showed the highest correlation to MOE(A). It was proven that in full-scale <b>boxed</b> <b>heart</b> square-cut structural lumber of sugi the effect of the knots on the strength was small. (3) The dynamic modulus of elasticity decreased in the transition from log to gren lumber. It is considered that sawing pattern and the ratio of juvenile wood in the lumber are involved in the reduction of this value. (4) The machine stress grading of the JAS (Japanese Agricultural Standard) using modulus of elasticity approximately corresponded with the value established by the Ministry of Construction notice. This sugegsts that lumber grown in Oita prefecture classfied according to the grading scale of the JAS can be utilized in terms of its strength preformance...|$|E
40|$|The Owase district, {{one of the}} {{advanced}} forestry ones, {{is located at the}} south-west part of Mie Prefecture facing the Sea of Kumano-nada, and covers Owase-shi, Miyama-cho and Kii-Nagashima-cho. 　 　So-called Owase forestry is exercised at about 55 % of the total private forest area of 33, 000 ha in the Owase district. It is labor-intensive, and characterized by growing Hinoki (Japanese Cypress), dense planting, frequent thinning, short rotation, full tree logging and the sawing of <b>boxed</b> <b>heart</b> wood square pillars. Although the forest soil of this area is not rich and there are no rivers adequate to raft logs, the commercial forestry of the area started quite early, next to the earliest Yoshino district. 　In part I, " The Formation and Development of the Owase Forestry in the Edo Era. " I attempt to look into why forestry started so early in this region, based on the analysis of the old documents kept by a Shoya (village headman) of Owase. 　The Owase forestry, which laid its foundation in the Edo era, has developed outwardly and quantitavely in terms of {{the advanced}} logging techniques, and internally and qualitatively in terms of the systematized and standardized tree-growing techniques, after the Meiji era. 　In part Ⅱ, " The Development of the Owase Forestry since the Meiji era. 　" I intend to verify the relationship between the both techniques and the commercial forestry. At the same time, I clarify the role of the Doi family in the advancement of the Owase orestry from the mid-Edo {{to the beginning of the}} Showa era. 　Because the post-war plantations are now reaching the marketable stage, the close cooperation between the timber growers and the processors is called for. The establishment of local indentity is also required. 　Part Ⅲ　discusses " The Name Value and the Market Mechanism of the Owase Lumber ", and is intended to help solving the problem facing us...|$|E
40|$|Recently Agriculture Department of Liguria Region had {{supported}} studies and researches on the timber quality of living trees in local coppice chestnut forests, {{with the prospect}} to produce also timber for structural use. Under some ad-hoc funds a 30 years old coppice forest in the high Bormida Valley, never thinned after the last utilization, has been chosen for sampling. 18 selected trunks were felled and the assortment called “Uso Fiume” (UF) was chosen, getting 49 beams (cross-section from 12 ¥ 12 to 24 ¥ 24 cm), by way of saw-mill operations The UF-beam is a structural element, derived from Italian tradition. Such elements are used in Italian buildings over the time, in substitution to structural sawn timber, principally for roofing. The UF-beam is a square edged log with wane; more precisely it is a full log, edged on four sides, maintaining <b>boxed</b> <b>heart</b> and an approximately central pith. Today the features of such a beam is established according to the specific Italian standard UNI 11035 - 3 for spruce and fir and to the CUAP (Common Understanding of Assessment Procedure) n. 03. 24 / 22 for chestnut and conifers. The beams were visually graded according to the Visual Strength Grading procedure and the physical and mechanical properties (density, modulus of elasticity-MOE and modulus of rupture- MOR) were determined according to the standard requirements (EN 408, EN 384, ISO 3131), disregarding the moisture content: the mechanical tests were performed with wood in green state (moisture content M. C. > 30 %) {{because it is the}} actual condition of use in building, due to the very low permeability of the chestnut heartwood which entails long seasoning time of large cross section beams. The study showed very high yields considering the stems-to-beams volume ratio, close to 70 %. Characteristics values of the sample resulted: char. density kg/m³, char. modulus of elasticity E 0,mean 10, 3 GPa and char. bending strength fm,k 28, 5 MPa. These results can be considered very promising because the data match the Strength Class D 24 (EN 338), the same Class as full cross-section chestnut beams (at M. C. = 12 %). </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTwo {{sorts of}} lumber drying house {{covered by a}} {{composite}} surface consisting of three layer transparent films and a carbon-fibre sheet (CF-sheet; looks like a semi-opaque) were invented and developed. One of them was built in Ashoro-cho, {{the eastern part of}} Hokkaido, Japan (the first proving site), and the other was built in Asahikawa-shi, the central part of Hokkaido (the second proving site). The dimension of each drying houses is a frontage of 4. 5 m, depth of 5. 0 m and height of 3. 4 m (the 1 st site) and the same frontage and depth as the former, but height of 3. 8 m (the 2 nd site), respectively. Two types of models of the drying house (East-West type and South-North-type) were desinged. The former is shaped like a half Quonset hut and the latter a just Quonset hut. All of the surfaces including the roof and walls except for a north wall of both models are covered by a composite surface. The composite surface is specially consisted by a triple transparent film from upper side and a CF-sheet to bottom side between which there are a few space of air layers. As a result of mutual effect of a spectral radiation properties of the films and the CF-sheet, a total solar radiation incident upon the drying house with cubic body composed of multi-surface from all the sky globally, can be collected into the house as solar rays volumetrically, converted into infrared radiation and trapped inside the drying house as solar heat passively, without any electric power. Moreover, the moist air inside the house being evaporated when drying green lumber can be naturally exhausted through two insulated cylinders (chimney) outside the drying house according to a principle of the thermo-siphon. From these reasons, “An opaque solar lumber drying house covered by a composite surface consisting of a triple-transparent film and a CF-sheet” could be called “A fully passive solar lumber drying house” in other word. In this paper, after explained the principle of drying mechanism due to solar radiation and heat rays, the experimental procedures and the results at the proving test, on a board-larch lumber at the 1 st proving site and a <b>boxed</b> <b>heart</b> squares-larch lumber for pillar material at the 2 nd proving site, were described and discussed thoroughly...|$|E
