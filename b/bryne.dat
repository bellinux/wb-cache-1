40|$|Oral {{squamous}} cell carcinoma has a great predisposition to produce metastasis in lymph nodes. In clinical practice, the treatment plan and prognosis of oral {{squamous cell}} carcinoma is mainly based on the primary tumor, regional lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis (TNM) staging system. However, this system does not provide any information on the biological characteristics and thus an aggressive clinical behavior of the tumor. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess some indicative histological parameters that would assist in the prognosis of these lesions. All cases of oral {{squamous cell carcinoma}}'s treated with wide excision of growth with radical neck dissection, registered between 2006 – 2009 in the Department of Pathology, Shree Krishna Hospital, Karamsad were studied retrospectively. Surgical specimens of 31 metastasizing tumors were compared with 26 tumors which did not metastasize. Each case was graded according to: Broders' classification in the whole thickness of tumor, Anneroth’s multifactorial grading system and <b>Bryne’s</b> deep invasive cell grading system. <b>Bryne’s</b> score showed an Odds ratio of 2. 12, 95 % C. I. (1. 41, 3. 18). The predictive value of the score is 73. 7 %. <b>Bryne’s</b> deep invasive cell score showed significant relation with lymph node metastasis.

500|$|In the United States, Margaret Sanger and Otto Bobsein popularized {{the phrase}} [...] "birth control" [...] in 1914. Sanger {{primarily}} advocated for birth {{control on the}} idea that it would prevent women from seeking unsafe abortions, but during her lifetime, she began to campaign for it {{on the grounds that it}} would reduce mental and physical defects. She was mainly active in the United States but had gained an international reputation by the 1930s. At the time, under the Comstock Law, distribution of birth control information was illegal. She jumped bail in 1914 after her arrest for distributing birth control information and left the United States for the United Kingdom. In the U.K., Sanger, influenced by Havelock Ellis, further developed her arguments for birth control. She believed women needed to enjoy sex without fearing a pregnancy. During her time abroad, Sanger also saw a more flexible diaphragm in a Dutch clinic, which she thought was a better form of contraceptive. Once Sanger returned to the United States, she established a short-lived birth-control clinic with the help of her sister, Ethel <b>Bryne,</b> based in the Brownville section of Brooklyn, New York in 1916. It was shut down after eleven days and resulted in her arrest. The publicity surrounding the arrest, trial, and appeal sparked birth control activism across the United States. Besides her sister, Sanger was helped in the movement by her first husband, William Sanger, who distributed copies of “Family Limitation.” Sanger’s second husband, James Noah H. Slee, would also later become involved in the movement, acting as its main funder.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Oral {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (OSCC) {{is one of the}} most common head and neck cancers. Objective. The aim of this study was to investigate the histopathological features of OSCC specimens obtained from incisional biopsies and to alert clinicians to the importance of more representative biopsies. Methods [...] Forty-eight OSCC samples were obtained from incisional biopsies and classified by <b>Bryne’s</b> score. The following morphological features were analyzed: invasive front, invasiveness, apoptotic cells, atypical mitosis, giant cells, acantholysis, ulceration, necrosis, calcification, surface epithelium, granulation tissue, desmoplasia, tissue invasions, inflammatory infiltrate and tumor thickness. Results. Ten (21 %) cases were classified as high grade malignancies and 38 (79 %) as low grade. Apoptotic cells (n = 26), atypical mitosis (1 - 2 / 20 ×; n = 38), giant cells (n = 8), acantholysis (n = 5), necrosis (n = 5), calcification (n = 1), granulation tissue (n = 32), desmoplasia (n = 4), perineural invasion (n = 2), muscular invasion (n = 8), invasion of salivary gland tissue (n = 3), vascular invasion (n = 10), and chronic inflammation (n = 33) were observed. Vascular invasion (p = 0. 04, Pearson’s χ 2 test) and necrosis (p = 0. 04, Pearson’s χ 2 test) were significantly associated with cases of high-grade malignant tumors. Atypical mitosis was associated with a greatest tumor thickness (p = 0. 04, Fischer’s exact test). Conclusion. This study suggests that incisional biopsies may be useful and significant as they can show histopathological variables that are important to classify oral {{squamous cell}} carcinomas into low grade and high grade according to <b>Bryne’s</b> score, which was used in this study. Thus, more representative biopsies might be useful to achieve this and allow a more accurate planning...|$|R
