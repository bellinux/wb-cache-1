25|$|The {{most common}} {{impurity}} of synthetic urea is <b>biuret,</b> which impairs plant growth.|$|E
25|$|Two {{reactions}} produce impurities. <b>Biuret</b> {{is formed}} when two molecules of urea combine {{with the loss}} of a molecule of ammonia.|$|E
25|$|The first {{appearance}} of ammelamide occurs prior to 225°C and is suspected also to occur from decomposition of <b>biuret</b> but is produced {{at a slower}} rate than that of CYA.|$|E
50|$|Under related conditions, {{pyrolysis}} of urea affords triuret ((H2N-CO-NH)2CO).In general, organic <b>biurets</b> (those with alkyl or aryl {{groups in}} place {{of one or more}} H atoms) are prepared by trimerization of isocyanates. For example, the trimer of 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate is also known as HDI-biuret.|$|R
2500|$|The term [...] "urea" [...] is {{also used}} for a class of {{chemical}} compounds that share the same functional group, a carbonyl group attached to two organic amine residues: RR'N—CO—NRR'. Examples include carbamide peroxide, allantoin, and hydantoin. Ureas {{are closely related to}} <b>biurets</b> and related in structure to amides, carbamates, carbodiimides, and thiocarbamides.|$|R
50|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of oximes proceeds easily by heating in {{the presence}} of various inorganic acids, and the oximes decompose into the corresponding ketones or aldehydes, and hydroxylamines. The reduction of oximes by sodium metal, sodium amalgam, hydrogenation, or reaction with hydride reagents produces amines. Typically the reduction of aldoximes gives both primary amines and secondary amines; however, reaction conditions can be altered (such as the addition of potassium hydroxide in a 1/30 molar ratio) to yield solely primary amines. In general, oximes can be changed to the corresponding amide derivatives by treatment with various acids. This reaction is called Beckmann rearrangement. In this reaction, a hydroxyl group is exchanged with the group that is in the anti position of the hydroxyl group. The amide derivatives that are obtained by Beckmann rearrangement can be transformed into a carboxylic acid by means of hydrolysis (base or acid catalyzed). And an amine by hoffman degradation of the amide {{in the presence}} of alkali hypoclorites at 80 degrees Celsius, the degradation is itself prone to side reactions, namely the formation of <b>biurets</b> or cyanate polymers., To avoid this side-reaction, strict temperature control is necessary; the reaction must be conducted at sufficient temperature to isomerise the cyanate to the isocyante.Also, good solvation is also crucial to be successful. Beckmann rearrangement is used for the industrial synthesis of caprolactam (see applications below).|$|R
25|$|FDA {{permits a}} certain amount of cyanuric acid to be present in some non-protein {{nitrogen}} (NPN) additives used in animal feed and drinking water. Cyanuric acid has been used as NPN. For example, Archer Daniels Midland manufactures an NPN supplement for cattle, which contains <b>biuret,</b> triuret, cyanuric acid and urea.|$|E
500|$|Freeman was {{appointed}} to the faculty of the University of Sydney in 1954 as a Lecturer, working his way up until he was made the inaugural Professor of Inorganic Chemistry in 1971. [...] Freeman pioneered the use of computers in crystallography in Australia, working on SILLIAC (the Australian cousin of the University of Illinois' ILLIAC machine and Australia's second computer) after its installation in 1956. [...] His research group extended its interests beyond purely organic compounds and on to metal complexes (such as copper <b>biuret,</b> one of the first bioinorganic substances to be structurally determined) and went on to determine the structures of numerous metal complexes of amino acids and peptides.|$|E
500|$|Hans adapted well {{to his new}} environment, quickly {{mastering}} his {{new language}} and demonstrating his outstanding scholastic ability. [...] He was dux of his primary school, dux of Sydney Boys High in 1945, and took his Bachelor's degree with the university medal in chemistry in 1949. [...] He {{was one of the}} ten chemistry students in his class at Sydney Boys High to go on to become Professors of Chemistry. [...] After receiving his MSc in 1952 under the supervision of Raymond Le Fevre FRS, Freeman attended Caltech on a Rotary Foundation Fellowship where, at the urging of Linus Pauling, he learned the fundamentals of crystallography. [...] He received a PhD in 1957 for his work on the structure of <b>biuret</b> hydrate, where he completed most of the calculations for the crystal structure by hand.|$|E
40|$|The {{extensive}} role hydrogen bonding {{plays in}} nature has been repeatedly emulated {{in the laboratory}} to produce both extensive networks and discrete aggregates.   As the principle interaction between many component groups, supramolecular chemists have employed hydrogen bonding to form various assemblies, and consequently this has become of increasing interest to biologists, chemists and biochemists.   Lehn, Cram, Etter, Reinhoudt and Whitesides have carried out notable work in this field.   It is the challenge of synthetic chemists to produce supramolecular structures, which can contribute towards areas of research as diverse as catalysis, electronics, medicine and nanotechnology. The complementary cyanuric acid and melamine components utilise hydrogen bonding in large numbers to form the highly ordered (CA. M) motif, which creates an infinite 2 -D hexagonal lattice.   It {{has been shown that}} by selectively attaching different bulky groups to the two amine groups on the melamine component, the preferential formation of either two types of 1 -D polymers or an additional cyclic hexagonal aggregate may form.   The latter, also referred to as a rosette has been comprehensively studied, however, it is the view of the author that the scope available for the  adaptation of this particular aggregate has not been fully exploited. In this work a variety of novel compounds have been prepared based upon both the cyanuric acid and melamine structures.   Classical synthetic chemistry based around the cyclisation of malonates and <b>biurets</b> have been supplemented with the exploitation of the Sonigashira palladium catalysed cross-coupling reaction to furnish a range of new linear bis(isocyanuric acids).   The synthesis of a melamine incorporating a pyridine group has now allowed the study of both metal coordinate binding and hydrogen bonding within this type of system.   In addition the synthesis of a range of verdazyl radicals also attached to pyridyl groups have been accomplished.

50|$|The <b>biuret</b> test is a {{chemical}} test for proteins and polypeptides. It {{is based on}} the <b>biuret</b> reagent, a blue solution that turns violet upon contact with proteins, or any substance with peptide bonds. The test and reagent do not actually contain biuret; they are so named because both <b>biuret</b> and proteins have the same response to the test.|$|E
50|$|Despite its name, the reagent {{does not}} in fact contain <b>biuret</b> ((H2N-CO-)2NH). The test is named so because it also gives a {{positive}} reaction to the peptide-like bonds in the <b>biuret</b> molecule.|$|E
50|$|Hofmeister {{also argued}} for peptide bonds {{based on the}} <b>biuret</b> {{reaction}} observed with all proteins but never with free amino acids. Since <b>biuret</b> has the formula NH2-CO-NH-CO-NH2, that suggested the presence of similar peptide bonds in proteins.|$|E
50|$|Two major {{modifications}} of the <b>biuret</b> test are commonly applied in modern colorimetric analysis of peptides: the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay and the Lowry assay.
