5|$|Although {{the species}} is {{primarily}} fossorial, it occasionally gathers food near the entrance of a tunnel. Dandelions seem to <b>be</b> <b>its</b> favorite food, and are also used as nesting material. During breeding season males will enter the tunnels of females, and males and females may make purring (or cooing) sounds when they are together. Mothers seem to comfort the young by softly vocalizing, with the young twittering in response.|$|E
5|$|As {{intriguing}} as geometric Newtonian gravity may <b>be,</b> <b>its</b> basis, classical mechanics, {{is merely}} a limiting case of (special) relativistic mechanics. In the language of symmetry: where gravity can be neglected, physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics. (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincaré group, which includes translations, rotations and boosts.) The {{differences between the two}} become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.|$|E

In criticism, reviewers considered Knight Lore sound to <b>be</b> <b>its</b> weakest component, though Your Spectrum and Clash also identified the sometimes cruel difficulty of its gameplay.

5|$|Energy {{from the}} Sun should have {{converted}} {{all traces of}} methane in Titan's atmosphere into more complex hydrocarbons within 50 million years—a short time compared {{to the age of}} the Solar System.

5|$|Established in 1667 by the German alchemist J. J.

5|$|For its United States release, {{the film}} was {{originally}} scheduled to be released on November 25, 2015, but 20th Century Fox switched The Martian with Victor Frankenstein, so the former would <b>be</b> <b>its</b> first film for all audiences in the country's Autumn season (September–November). On the film's 3D screenings, RealD's chief Anthony Marcoly said 3D technology was proliferating from action-packed blockbuster films commonly released in the United States' summer season. Marcoly said the technology was being used in more immersive storytelling, citing The Martian and The Walk (released the same year) as two examples.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Glenn T.

It was not until decades later that element 103 was finally conclusively synthesized and this prediction was experimentally confirmed.|$|E

Cai and Feng (1982) and Wang(1985) elevated it to species status based on morphological and ecological differences from the woolly hare. In 2005, {{it was found that}} molecular phylogenetics indicated the Yunnan hare and the woolly hare to be sister taxa, and they may exhibit allopatric speciation or parapatric speciation. It might also be related to the Indian hare (Lepus nigricollis) and probably <b>be</b> <b>its</b> northern form.|$|E

5|$|The machine's most {{significant}} innovation {{is generally considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>its</b> incorporation of index registers, commonplace on modern computers. The SSEM had included two registers, implemented as Williams tubes: the accumulator (A) and the program counter (C). As A and C had already been assigned, the tube holding the two index registers, originally known as B-lines, was given the name B. The contents of the registers {{could be used to}} modify program instructions, allowing convenient iteration through an array of numbers stored in memory. The Mark 1 also had a fourth tube, (M), to hold the multiplicand and multiplier for a multiplication operation.|$|E
5|$|The main {{short-term}} {{danger to}} Enron's survival {{at the end}} of October 2001 seemed to <b>be</b> <b>its</b> credit rating. It was reported at the time that Moody's and Fitch, two of the three biggest credit-rating agencies, had slated Enron for review for possible downgrade. Such a downgrade would force Enron to issue millions of shares of stock to cover loans it had guaranteed, which would decrease the value of existing stock further. Additionally, all manner of companies began reviewing their existing contracts with Enron, especially in the long term, in the event that Enron's rating were lowered below investment grade, a possible hindrance for future transactions.|$|E
