According to the prosecutor, Lars-Eric Petersson had, {{without the consent of}} the Board, removed the cap on the <b>bonus</b> <b>programme</b> by signing a document named Appendix 3, and thus causing payments of additionally approx. SEK 156 million to the beneficiaries. According to the Court of Appeal, the prosecutor was not able to prove that the limitation for Wealthbuilder was still in force when Lars-Eric Petersson signed Appendix 3 in December 2000. The charges were therefore dismissed. (Translation of the press release from the Svea Court of Appeal) ...|$|E

40|$|Urbanization sets further {{pressure}} on the building industry. The migration from rural areas to cities continues to grow and in Latin America 90 % {{of the population is}} estimated to live in cities by 2050. In Peru {{more than a quarter of}} the total population lives in the capital Lima. Despite Peru’s unprecedented economic growth the last years many people lack adequate housing. In order to solve the housing deficit and to provide access to housing the State and the private sector have to work together. Fondo Mivivenda (FMV) is an organisation addressing this issue. FMV works as a second-tier bank and have reached great success with the programme Crédito MiVivienda, providing mortgage loans to low-incomers. FMV are today developing a financial <b>bonus</b> <b>programme</b> in order to promote green social housing. To create sustainable houses, cities and communities it is essential with a comprehensive approach. Recently the impact our buildings have on the environment is realized but often the social sustainability is largely neglected while priority is given to economic and environmental sustainability in the context of planning and housing. With Fondo MiVivienda’s Green <b>Bonus</b> <b>Programme</b> as starting point, the research examines the importance of including social sustainability in green social housing. The outcomes of this research are presented in a design proposal exemplifying how social sustainability can be achieved in low-cost housing projects situated in Lima. With means of flexible apartments, smart greenery and mixed-functions we can create long-term sustainable livelihoods with high level of local participation.

40|$|Despite {{a strong}} plea for {{integrating}} sustainability goals into traditional corporate bonus schemes, a comprehensive implementation {{of these systems}} has been lacking until recently. This article explores four illustrative cases from the Netherlands, where several multinationals started to pioneer with sustainable bonuses {{in the past few}} years. The article examines the setups and the different elements of <b>bonus</b> <b>programmes</b> used, in terms of performance criteria (focusing in particular on external vs. internal benchmarking), their link to specific stakeholders, type and size of bonuses, target levels and transparency. While sustainable bonuses signal corporate awareness of responsibility vis-à-vis society and stakeholders, credibility varies considerably depending on these elements. Our case evidence sheds some light {{on the extent to which}} sustainable bonuses may be a credible sign of corporate responsibility or rather just another perverse mechanism meant to keep up bonus levels (window dressing). A definite assessment is hampered by the emergent state and lack of full transparency—while ‘justified’ by companies for competitive reasons, this raises questions. Insights are offered to appraise current and future systems and provide directions for further research...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Organisations need to {{have the}} ability to recruit and retain {{appropriate}} knowledge workers in order to create an inflow of knowledge and skills to develop and maintain their competitiveness. High technology organisations, particularly, rely on knowledge workers to transfer human capital into intellectual capital by turning technological knowledge into products. Taiwan is renowned for information and communication technology (ICT) product design and manufacture. This research uses Taiwan’s high technology industry as a sample to examine the recruitment, selection and retention practices for knowledge workers. Three organisation ownership types exist in Taiwan’s context: Taiwanese-owned,foreign-owned and non-private. This study asks: what are the current recruitment, selection and retention practices for knowledge workers in Taiwan’s high technology industry? Are there any differences in the three types of ownership group? Do ownership groups influence knowledge workers’ decisions to join or stay in their organisations? To answer these questions, a quantitative survey was conducted from September 2009 to March 2010, and two hundred valid questionnaire responses were collected (a response rate: 67 %). Additionally, interviews were conducted with human resource managers in 10 organisations under various ownerships to collect information that was unobtainable in the questionnaire survey. This research contributes empirical evidence about the current recruitment/selection and retention practices for knowledge workers in Taiwan’s high technology industry. The results showed that organisations within various ownership groups preferred to use different practices. Taiwanese-owned firms predominantly used on-line agents to recruit knowledge workers and relied on employee ownership <b>bonus</b> <b>programmes</b> to attract and retain knowledge workers. Foreign-owned firms, significantly, used head hunters. They provided their knowledge workers with high base salaries, challenging and interesting work, and influential power over work-related decisions. Non-private organisations were significantly different in their adoption of company websites. They offered good training programmes, opportunities to access new technology, and attractive work-life balance, reflecting their research-oriented ethos.

Individual passenger prioritisations decide whether a person is treated with priority at the common security control point which is a critical element of the infrastructure. In the model, status group division takes place at boarding card control. Instead of membership to a passenger class or frequent-flier <b>bonus</b> <b>programme,</b> traffic aspects are now the defining factor in guaranteeing priorities. The investigations were carried out using a microscopic fast-time simulation. A variety of strategies recommend themselves with regard to maximising the number of passengers who can actually catch their flight, depending on the capacity load...|$|E
40|$|Aim - Bonus schemes within German {{statutory}} {{health insurance}} (GKV) use monetary incentives to promote health-conscious behaviour, particularly amongst risk groups. The {{idea is to}} exploit a latent potential for participation in money-saving preventive measures. First studies suggest that incidental effects (good risks) are more common than prevention effects. The purpose of the article is to present factors contributing to the successfulness of incentive schemes. Methods - To outline the findings of current research, {{an analysis of the}} literature was carried out. By law, sickness funds in Germany have to report on savings made. This kind of report portrays cost-efficiency but does not provide an assessment of general learning with regard to optimal practice. The analysis therefore also included studies from commercial areas in order to identify possible success factors and research needs. Results - The results of the literature analysis show that not only do the core elements of bonus schemes play a significant role, but additional elements (reminder systems, removing barriers) also help to increase the participation rate in prevention measures. Conclusion - In order to stimulate health-conscious behaviour, more attention should in future be paid to the removal of barriers to information, knowledge, and empowerment. <b>Bonus</b> <b>programme,</b> Health insurance funds, Communication, Prevention, Incentives, Motivation...|$|E
40|$|This {{report has}} been {{elaborated}} {{as part of}} the CHANGE research project ([URL] funded by the <b>BONUS</b> <b>programme</b> and national research funding institutions, in this case the Academy of Finland. The overall objective of the interdisciplinary CHANGE project is to reduce to a minimum the supply of toxic compounds from antifouling paints used on leisure boats in the Baltic Sea by changing antifouling practices on leisure boats into a sustainable consumption of antifouling paints and practices. As part of the CHANGE project, a mapping of EU legislation as well as national legislation in Sweden, Finland and Denmark has been carried out. This report maps the Finnish legal framework regarding antifouling paints on leisure boats {{as well as for the}} use of alternative techniques. The report starts with an introduction to the overall governance structure of the legislation and the relevant authorities. It then is divided into four areas of law relevant to antifouling paints and practices, including regulation of environmental quality, products, waste management and other environmental issues as well as contaminated land and sediments. Furthermore, the report includes a table containing an analysis from the actors’ perspective. The report is based on a legal-dogmatic research on applicable national legislation based on relevant sources of law as well as relevant reports, articles etc. Finnish legislation is accessible in both Finnish and Swedish languages at the national database [URL]...|$|E

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} use and effects of Customer Relationship Management, and {{attempts}} to posit how the technology may develop in the future, while also presenting recommendations regarding how companies may wish to adapt their policy {{in order to make}} best use of the technology. The paper begins by looking at the issues of CRM and data protection, as well as surveillance culture. This is looked at from the perspectives of both consumers and organisations, and a wide background framework is presented. The second section of the work explains why the topic was chosen, and presents {{the manner in which the}} focus of the research was chosen - the author’s experience and access to consumer markets in both Germany and Ireland, and interest in loyalty card schemes which are used in both countries. Overall aims are presented, and a thorough literature review is also undertaken, in order to make sure the work is fully contextualised. A full explanation of CRM technology, as well as a description of legislation and practice in the two countries is also given. There is then a thorough explanation of the research methods chosen, and the manner in which they were deemed to be appropriate for this particular project is also discusses. Ethical issues are discusses, and the full method chosen for the research is put forward and justified. Results are then presented in the following section of the work, and the results are analysed and illustrate trends within both countries, also discuss differences between the two. The limitations of the research and possible flaws are discusses, conclusions are presented, and recommendations are drawn from these. The findings of this thesis essentially illustrate that Irish and German consumers of all classes and ages think more critically than would have been expected when it comes to the issue of data protection. This critical attitude concerns the private and public sectors in equal measure. The thesis further discovered that the most significant disparities lie between how different groups of people think and act. This gap is large and as there are no obvious disadvantages, they ignore the technological progress and the potential negative effect further developments that such technology might have. What is more, it has been shown that there are several features which distinguish the populations of Ireland and Gennany. Most notably, the fear of state surveillance is more deeply rooted in Germany than in Ireland. In relation to loyalty card behaviour and how German people deal practically with matters of data protection, there is no significant difference between behaviour of consumers in both countries. In other words German respondents, who have a different and a stricter attitude to the issue of data protection, tend to act in a less critical way. At the moment, bonus programs are widely accepted in both countries because of the strong desire for the small benefits they offer, which overrides people’s concern for the protection of their data. As long as companies who offer loyalty cards deal responsibly and transparently with the issue of data protection, consumers will benefit in the long run from <b>bonus</b> <b>programmes.</b> It can therefore be argued that CRM is currently not having a discernible effect on customers’ behaviour...|$|R
40|$|M. Comm. The use {{of equity}} {{incentives}} has gained popularity {{since the early}} nineties for various reasons. Some of these are the need {{to attract and retain}} executives, management’s desire to share in global asset price growth, aligning managers and shareholders’ objectives and the perceived low cost of granting options as part of the compensation package. The main objective of equity based compensation plans are on aligning management goals with those of shareholders. This study examined the relationship between equity based compensation and price to book values of retail firms listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Many listed firms replaced fixed salaries of executives with variable performance pay components such as cash <b>bonuses,</b> share purchase <b>programmes,</b> share options or share grants. Researchers are divided whether equity compensation is efficient and there is currently no theoretical or empirical consensus on how equity compensation affects firm performance. The results of the study indicated a statistical insignificant relationship between share based payments and change in price to book values. More effective equity incentive plans need to be put in place as the current share option schemes most firms employ, are not achieving their objectives...|$|R
40|$|We make {{an attempt}} to {{consolidate}} results {{from a number of}} recent studies into spatial patterns of temporal variations in Baltic Sea wave properties. The analysis is based on historically measured and visually observed wave data, which are compared with the results of numerical hindcasts using both simple fetch-based one-point models and contemporary spectral wave models forced with different wind data sets. The focus is on the eastern regions of the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Finland for which long-term wave data sets are available. We demonstrate that {{a large part of the}} mismatches between long-term changes to wave properties at selected sites can be explained by the rich spatial patterns in changes to the Baltic Sea wave fields that are not resolved by the existing wave observation network.
