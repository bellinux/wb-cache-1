The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the possibility of utilizing iron ore tailings (IOT) to replace clay as alumina-silicate raw material for the production of Portland cement clinker. For this purpose, two kinds of clinkers were prepared: one was prepared by IOT; the other was prepared by clay as a reference. The reactivity and <b>burnability</b> of raw meal, mineralogical composition and physical properties of clinker, and hydration characteristic of cement were studied by <b>burnability</b> analysis, differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, and hydration analysis. The results showed that the raw meal containing IOT had higher reactivity and <b>burnability</b> than the raw meal containing clay, and the use of IOT did not affect the formation of characteristic mineralogical phases of Portland cement clinker. Furthermore, the physical and mechanical performance of two cement clinkers were similar. In addition, the use of IOT was found to improve the grindability of clinker and lower the hydration heat of Portland cement.

Both gave satisfactory <b>burnability</b> indexes (BI) and high percentages of replacement of limestone (up to 38 %) and clay (up to 72 %). EAF slag was introduced in the kiln feed at a lesser degree (20 %), but promoted a better raw mix burttability: furthermore, being a non-carbonated source of lime, it allows a reduction of both thermal requirement and emission of COZ, gas responsible for the greenhouse effect.

40|$|The use of {{selected}} secondary materials {{for improving the}} reactivity of cement raw mix, is a challenging subject. It is known that certain foreign elements exert a considerable effect on the cement raw mix <b>burnability</b> and clinker structure, even at low concentration. This work {{is part of a}} project on the use {{of selected}} minerals as a source of elements having a positive effect on the <b>burnability</b> of cement raw mix. The minerals, iron rich wolframite, stibnite and a wolframite-stibnite assemblage, were selected in order to introduce W, Sb and S in the cement raw mix. One reference and twelve modified mixtures, prepared by mixing the reference sample with 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 % w/w of the above minerals, were studied. Their effect on the <b>burnability</b> is discussed in Part I. The subject of this paper is their effect on the structure of the produced clinker. The XRD studies, performed in samples that were burned at 1450 °C, showed that the diffraction patterns correspond to a structure of a typical clinker, obtained at the above temperatures. In addition, samples sintered at lower temperature (1200 - 1400 °C) were examined in order to investigate the effect of the additives on the intermediate products. It is concluded that the added compounds affect mainly the structure of calcium aluminate and calcium aluminoferrite phases, due to their dissolution in the melt formed during the sintering. Scanning Electron Microscopy was used in order to examine the structure of the clinker and the distribution of the foreign elements in its main phases. It is shown that W and Sb are mainly concentrated in the solidified melt. In addition, bigger and more roundish alite crystals are found in these samples.

40|$|Abstract. The {{study on}} the use of blast furnace slag, steel slag and fly ash as raw {{materials}} to produce cement clinker has been carried out in the present investigation. The <b>burnability</b> of raw meal was determined by the linear shrinkage and free lime content of clinkers sintered at different temperatures. The microstructrue and properties of raw meal and clinker were investigated by the means of chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction and petrographic analysis. The physical and mechanical performance of cement was tested according to the standards. The results showed that the <b>burnability</b> was good as the free lime content was lower than 0. 5 w % in the clinker sintered at 1350 ℃. It is believed that the nucleation of alite only needs to grow bigger and rearrange with the rising temperature. The micrograph of clinker sintered at 1450 ℃ showed that there were some garlands of belite crystals around alite crystals because of high temperature or the local reducing atmosphere caused by the compact raw meal.

Laboratory measurements showed that the <b>burnability</b> index for a clinker-generating raw mixture consisting of commercial clay and the exhausted sorbent was better than that of a reference mixture containing the same clay and fresh limestone. The results of the <b>burnability</b> test were confirmed by (i) the mineralogical composition data on the synthetic clinkers obtained from both raw mixtures at 1500 °C and (ii) the hydration rate of the related Portland cements, evaluated by means of X-ray diffraction analysis and simultaneous differential thermal-thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. Preliminary and novel results here reported show that the utilization of the spent limestone sorbent as a raw material for making cement can have a very favorable effect not only on the economics of the CaL-FB process, but also on the cement manufacture in terms of (i) reduced generation of carbon dioxide and pollutants, (ii) saving of raw materials and fuel, (iii) decreased flow rate of gaseous emissions...|$|E
40|$|The cement {{industry}} has {{for some time}} been seeking procedures that would effectively reduce the high energy and environmental costs of cement manufacture. One such procedure {{is the use of}} alternative materials as partial replacements for fuel, raw materials or even clinker. The present study explores the reactivity and <b>burnability</b> of cement raw mixes containing fired red or white ceramic wall tile wastes and combinations of the two as alternative raw materials. The results showed that the new raw mixes containing this kind of waste to be technically viable, and to have higher reactivity and <b>burnability</b> than a conventional mix, providing that the particle size of the waste used is lower than 90 μm. The mineralogical composition and distribution in the experimental clinker prepared were comparable to the properties of the clinker manufactured with conventional raw materials. Due to the presence of oxides such as ZnO, ZrO 2 and B 2 O 3 in tile glazing, the content of these oxides was higher in clinker made with such waste. The mix of red and white ceramic wall tile waste was found to perform equally or better than each type of waste separately, a promising indication that separation of the two would be unnecessary for the purpose described above. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The {{basis for this}} property is a well-burned clinker with consistent chemical composition and free lime. The main reason for the clinker free lime to change in situation with stable kiln operation is variation in the chemical composition of the kiln feed. This variation in chemical composition is related to raw mix control and the homogenization process. To ensure a constant quality of the product and maintain a stable and continuous operation of the kiln, the attention must be paid to storage and homogenization of raw materials and kiln feed. Due to variations in the kiln feed chemical compositions that affect its <b>burnability</b> and the fuel consumption. The raw materials for Portland cement production are the mixture (as fine powder in the 'Dry process') of minerals containing calcium oxide, silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, ferric oxide, and magnesium oxide.

Higher replacement of grinding sludge was found to improve <b>burnability,</b> reduce formation of major of cement compositions (dicalcium silicate, C 2 S and tricalcium aluminate, C 3 A), lower in silica and alumina ratios, but promote the formation of tricalcium silicate (C 3 S) and tetracalcium aluminateferrite (C 4 AF). Microstructural analysis of the synthesized Portland clinker revealed that the grinding sludge promoted formation of secondary C 2 S as well as caused color change of C 3 S. Thai regulatory leaching procedure was performed on the synthesized clinker and mortar samples. The concentrations of heavy metals in the leachate were found below the limits. Moreover, the maximum substitution of grinding sludge was found to be 2 % of grinding sludge. Thus, this sludge has potential applications as an alternative raw material in cement production...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} the present {{dissertation}} is the exploitation of selected Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste, obtained from buildings C&D works, as substitutes of the conventional raw materials {{that are used in}} the cement industry for the production of clinker cement. The C&D waste which are faced in this research are Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RMA) and Recycled Masonry Aggregates (RMA). According to the target that has set in this dissertation, the planning of the experimental process is focused in three parts. The basic points of each part are ascribed afterwards: a) Characterization of C&D waste, examination of their composition compatibility with the composition of the cement raw meal of industrial origin and cement raw meal mixtures determination - preparation, b) <b>Burnability</b> study of cement raw meal mixtures and c) Preparation of clinkers and Portland cements and examination of their quality characteristics. Compendiously, from {{the results of the present}} dissertation is concluded that RCA and RMA could be credible carriers of calcium and silica, respectively, into the raw materials mixture of cement. Their introduction into the cement raw meal indicates their positive effect in terms of burning process, improving significantly the operation of this procedure. Moreover, from the analysis of the produced clinkers and the arise Portland cements is resulted that the addition of RCA and RMA into raw materials mixture does not affect negatively their quality characteristics. The importance of the above mentioned remarks is more sensible taking into account that there are no clear references in the literature concerned with the exploitation of C&D waste as cement raw meal components for the production of clinker. This reality amplifies the ingenuity of the dissertation subject as well as renders the specific research a tool for its potential implementation in industrial scale. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of CaO and P 2 O 5 upon the reactivity of cement raw meal {{was investigated in}} this paper. Ash of bone meal containing Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 - 3 CaO·P 2 O 5 {{was used as the}} source of P 2 O 5. Two series of samples with different content of the ash of bone meal were prepared. In the first series, the ash of bone was added into cement raw meal. The second series of samples were prepared by considering ash as one of CaO sources. Therefore, the total content of CaO in cement raw meal was kept constant, while the amount of P 2 O 5 increased. These different series of samples were investigated by analyzing free lime content in the clinkers. The XRD analysis and Electron Micro Probe Analyzer analysis of the clinkers were also carried out. Two parameters were used to characterize the reactivity of cement raw meal: content of free lime and <b>Burnability</b> Index (BI) calculated from free lime content in both series of samples burnt at 1350 ºC, 1400 ºC, 1450 ºC and 1500 ºC. According to the first parameter, P 2 O 5 content that drastically makes worse the reactivity of cement raw meal was found at 1. 11 wt. % in the first series, while this limit has reached 1. 52 wt. % in the second one. According to the BI, the limit of P 2 O 5 was found at 1. 42 wt. % in the first series and 1, 61 wt. % in the second one. Furthermore, EPMA has demonstrated the presence of P 2 O 5 in both calcium silicate phases forming thus solid solutions...|$|E
40|$|Calcium looping is a {{promising}} post-combustion technology for capturing CO 2 from flue gases by using solid CaO-based sorbents (e. g. limestone). It {{is based on}} a dual fluidized bed (DFB) system that involves a carbonator - where flue gas is absorbed by CaO - and a regenerator where captured CO 2 is enriched to be processed and stored. The potential reuse of spent – from repeated cycles - CaO in cement raw meal is among the advantages of the technology. This could allow substantial CO 2 savings in an industry that thrives for decarbonisation. In this study, purged CaO – taken from a 200 KWth DFB pilot facility in the University of Stuttgart - was used in raw meal. The aim was to evaluate if clinker (thus cement and concrete) of acceptable quality can be produced and if any bottlenecks exist. Purged CaO was found chemically compatible with raw meal and can replace all limestone in the mix without altering the quality targets. Its elevated SO 3 content (approx. 2 %) however allows for approximately. 10 % addition or else clogging phenomena can occur in the preheater. Practically to allow complete limestone replacement and avoid undesired process implications – in kiln systems with no by-pass installed - SO 3 of the purged sorbent must be kept up to 0. 3 %. Trace elements were found very low, posing no concern for clinker or emissions. Sulphur was in the form of anhydrite, thus it is not expected to give rise to SOx emissions. <b>Burnability</b> of raw meal was improved and clinker quality was found similar to the reference case. A higher C 2 S content that was detected was not in expense of C 3 S thus no detrimental effect on early strength is anticipated. It was estimated that for every 1 % of purged CaO replacing limestone, a CO 2 save of 3. 6 kg/tn of raw meal can be achieved. Equivalently, a plant producing 1 mil. tons of clinker/annum, can save approx. 300. 000 tons of CO 2 emitted...|$|E
