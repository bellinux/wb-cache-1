40|$|Psychoacoustic {{testing of}} {{simulated}} helicopter main rotor noise is described, and the subjective results are presented. The objective {{of these tests}} was to evaluate the potential acoustic benefits of main rotors with modulated (uneven) <b>blade</b> <b>spacing.</b> Sound simulations were prepared for six main rotor configurations. A baseline 4 -blade main rotor with regular <b>blade</b> <b>spacing</b> {{was based on the}} Bell Model 427 helicopter. A 5 -blade main rotor with regular spacing was designed to approximate the performance of the 427, but at reduced tipspeed. Four modulated rotors - one with "optimum" spacing and three alternate configurations - were derived from the 5 <b>bladed</b> regular <b>spacing</b> rotor. The sounds were played to 2 subjects at a time, with care being taken in the speaker selection and placement to ensure that the sounds were identical for each subject. A total of 40 subjects participated. For each rotor configuration, the listeners were asked to evaluate the sounds in terms of noisiness. The test results indicate little to no "annoyance" benefit for the modulated <b>blade</b> <b>spacing.</b> In general, the subjects preferred the sound of the 5 -blade regular spaced rotor over any of the modulated ones. A conclusion is that modulated <b>blade</b> <b>spacing</b> is not a promising design feature to reduce the annoyance for helicopter main rotors...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} on the noise characteristics of four-bladed general aviation propellers with uneven <b>blade</b> <b>spacing.</b> The subscale propeller designs were inspired by the fourbladed McCauley propellers used on the Beechcraft King Air 350 series aircraft. The 4 -inch diameter (1 : 22. 5 scale) propellers were manufactured using high-resolution stereolithography and were powered by a high performance, radio controlled brushless electric motor. Acoustic measurements were taken with a 24 -microphone array. The use of uneven <b>blade</b> <b>spacing</b> created additional tones over which the acoustic intensity was distributed. Large amounts of acoustic intensity were shifted into the lowest frequency tone (occuring at half of the blade passage frequency of the propeller with evenly <b>spaced</b> <b>blades),</b> resulting in reductions of A-weighted overall sound pressure levels of up to 5 dB for polar angles near 90. These reduction are partly offset by increases in A-weighted overall sound pressure levels of up to 4 dB at polar angles less than 50. Although the theory used to predict propeller noise does not show good agreement with experiments, it does show this trend of increasing noise at low polar angles. Since noise at low polar angles are weighted less in noise metrics such as flyover noise, the use of uneven <b>blade</b> <b>spacing</b> has potential for providing noise reduction without adding excessive complexity to propeller design...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of a}} NASA {{initiative}} to reduce helicopter main rotor noise, a Phase 1 study has been performed of candidate noise reduction concepts. Both conventional and novel design technologies have been analyzed that reduce the community impact of helicopter operations. In this study the noise reduction potential and design implications are assessed for conventional means of noise reduction, e. g., tip speed reduction, tip shapes and airfoil tailoring, and for two innovative design concepts: modulated <b>blade</b> <b>spacing</b> and x-force control. Main rotor designs that incorporate modulated <b>blade</b> <b>spacing</b> are shown to have reduced peak noise levels in most flight operations. X-force control alters the helicopter's force balance whereby the miss distance between main rotor blades and shed vortices can be controlled. This control provides a high potential to mitigate BVI noise radiation. Each concept is evaluated using best practice design and analysis methods, achieving the study's aim to significantly reduce noise with minimal performance degradation and no vibration increase. It is concluded that a SILENT main rotor design, incorporating the modulated <b>blade</b> <b>spacing</b> concept, offers significantly reduced noise levels and the potential of a breakthrough in how a helicopter's sound is perceived and judged. The SILENT rotor represents a definite advancement in the state-of-the-art and is selected as the design concept for demonstration in Phase 2.

40|$|The {{requirements}} on gas turbines for aircraft power units, namely, adequate efficiency, operation at high gas temperatures, low weight, and small dimensions, {{must be taken}} into consideration during the design of the blading. To secure good efficiency, it is necessary that the gas flow past the blades as smoothly as possible without separation. This is relatively easily obtainable in the accelerated flow of turbine blading, if the <b>blade</b> <b>spacing</b> is chosen small enough. A small <b>blade</b> <b>spacing,</b> however, is detrimental to the other requirements outlined above. Operation at high gas temperatures usually calls for blade cooling. This cooling is associated with a power input that lowers the turbine efficiency. Since the amount of heat that must be carried off for coding a blade can be influenced rather little, the gross power input for a turbine stage can be reduced by keeping the number of blades to a minimum, that is, with <b>blades</b> of high <b>spacing</b> ratio. But here also a limit is imposed, the exceeding of which is followed by separation of flow. Hence the requirement of finding blade forms on which the flow separates at rather high spacing ratios...|$|R
