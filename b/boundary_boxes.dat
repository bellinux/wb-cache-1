40|$|Manual offline analysis, of a {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} (SEM) image, is a time consuming process and requires continuous human intervention and efforts. This paper presents an image processing based method for automated offline analyses of SEM images. To this end, our strategy relies on a two-stage process, viz. texture analysis and quantification. The method involves a preprocessing step, aimed at the noise removal, {{in order to avoid}} false edges. For texture analysis, the proposed method employs a state of the art Curvelet transform followed by segmentation through a combination of entropy filtering, thresholding and mathematical morphology (MM). The quantification is carried out by the application of a box-counting algorithm, for fractal dimension (FD) calculations, with the ultimate goal of measuring the parameters, like surface area and perimeter. The perimeter is estimated indirectly by counting the <b>boundary</b> <b>boxes</b> of the filled shapes. The proposed method, when applied to a representative set of SEM images, not only showed better results in image segmentation but also exhibited a good accuracy in the calculation of surface area and perimeter.

40|$|Generic object recognition, {{the problem}} of {{recognising}} categories of objects, {{has been a long}} standing challenge in computer vision. While a histogram of quantised local features widely known as the bag-of-visual-words model is shown to perform well due to its simplicity and robustness, it fails to capture spatial relationships between local features which are also important in modelling object categories. Pairs of visual words and higher-order spatial features encode such spatial information into the bag-of-visual-words model by enumerating spatial combinations of visual words. Unfortunately, these combinations grow exponentially large. Feature selection is used {{to reduce the number of}} the combinations, but requires additional information such as class labels and <b>boundary</b> <b>boxes.</b> In this thesis, we provide a new perspective on capturing spatial relationships between local features and propose the local pairwise codebook (LPC) to approach the combinatorial problem differently from existing pairing methods, making feature selection unnecessary. We represent each pair of spatially nearby local descriptors as a joint descriptor and apply k-means clustering to these joint descriptors to build a codebook in an unsupervised manner. The construction of the LPC is independent to the number of visual words which effectively avoids the combinatorial explosion. The LPC takes the underlying distribution of pairs of spatially nearby local features into account by minimising the quantisation error of the distribution. We show that the LPC outperforms existing pairing methods and performs competitively against state-of-the-art methods for generic object recognition. Several extensions to the LPC are also proposed in this thesis to demonstrate its wide applicability. First, to increase the discrimination of the codebook, sparse coding is utilised. Second, to improve robustness against object deformation, we describe a scale-invariant object representation based on the codebook by exploiting the nearest neighbour-based distance between local features instead of the pixel-based distance. Third, to accelerate the iterative optimisation of sparse coding, we propose a fast approximation method based on the generalised LASSO. The final outcome of this thesis is an innovative generic object recognition system that outperforms existing methods across challenging datasets by compactly and efficiently modelling discriminative spatial relations between local features...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Dynamic {{analysis}} of many mechanical systems is often involved with contacts among bodies. This paper presents an efficient and general-purpose contact search algorithm for multibody dynamics {{in the context}} of the compliance contact force model. While many conventional collision detection algorithms are based on the absolute coordinate system, this paper proposes to use the relative coordinate system in detecting a contact. A <b>boundary</b> <b>box</b> of a defense surface geometry is divided into many blocks. A contact reference frame is defined on the defense body of a contact pair. Since all geometric variables necessary to detect a contact are measured relative to the contact reference frame attached to the defense body, the variables belonging to the defense body are constant, which significantly reduces computation time associated with the contact search. Therefore, the contact reference frame plays a key role in developing an efficient contact search algorithm. Contour of the defense body is approximated by many piecewise triangular patches, while contour of the hitting body is represented by hitting nodes along its <b>boundary.</b> Bounding <b>boxes</b> inside which contain each body of a contact pair are defined at a preprocessing stage to eliminate an exhaustive contact inspection when two bodies are in a distance. If two bounding boxes are turned out to be in a contact during the pre-search, each node on the hitting boundary i...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In an {{intelligent}} surveillance system, object tracking provides {{better sense of}} security using visual information. Hence, {{the main purpose of}} this work is to develop an object motion detection system that detected the presence of motion in video sequences. The proposed system employed background modelling and image differential techniques to isolate the motion objects from its background. Additionally, morphology processes are performed to enhance the object pixels that have been extracted so that a more accurate output image that comprised of the detected object can be determined. Subsequently, the plotting method is intentionally developed to denote the object being tracked. Two different approaches were utilized namely, edge detection and <b>boundary</b> <b>box.</b> The plotting process will be updated as the object moves in the video surrounding. In addition, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the system is built to facilitate users to apply the developed system and understand its hierarchy.

The feasibility and workability of the proposed detection system along with the built GUI is demonstrated throughout the experimental results that clearly detect and track the moving objects in the video sequences recorded in the outdoor environment...|$|R
