5|$|Modern scholar Peter Davies surmises that Eusebius is {{referring}} to the same event as Lactantius, but that he heard of the event through public rumors and knew nothing of the privileged discussion at the emperor's private religion ceremony that Lactantius had access to. Since it was Galerius's army {{that would have been}} purgedDiocletian had left his in Egypt to quell continuing unrestAntiochenes would understandably have believed Galerius to be its instigator. The historian David Woods argues instead that Eusebius and Lactantius are referring to completely different events. Eusebius, according to Woods, describes the <b>beginnings</b> of the army purge in Palestine, while Lactantius describes events at court. Woods asserts that the relevant passage in Eusebius's Chronicon was corrupted in the translation to Latin and that Eusebius's text originally located the <b>beginnings</b> of the army persecution at a fort in Betthorus (El-Lejjun, Jordan).|$|E
