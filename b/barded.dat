40|$|The BRCA 1 -associated ring domain protein 1 (<b>BARD</b> 1) {{interacts with}} BRCA 1 via its RING finger domain. The <b>BARD</b> 1 -BRCA 1 complex participates in DNA repair, cell cycle control, genomic stability, and mitotic spindle {{formation}} through its E 3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Cancer cells express several <b>BARD</b> 1 protein isoforms, including the RING finger-deficient variant <b>BARD</b> 1 beta. Here, {{we show that}} <b>BARD</b> 1 has BRCA 1 -dependent and BRCA 1 -independent functions in mitosis. <b>BARD</b> 1, but not BRCA 1, localizes to the midbody at telophase and cytokinesis, where it colocalizes with Aurora B. The 97 -kDa full-length (FL) <b>BARD</b> 1 coimmunoprecipates with BRCA 1, but the 82 -kDa <b>BARD</b> 1 beta coimmunoprecipitates with Aurora B and BRCA 2. We used selective small interfering RNAs to distinguish the functions of FL <b>BARD</b> 1 and <b>BARD</b> 1 beta. Depletion of FL <b>BARD</b> 1 had only minor effects on cell growth and did not abolish midbody localization of <b>BARD</b> 1 staining, but resulted in massive up-regulation of Aurora B. In contrast, suppression of FL <b>BARD</b> 1 and <b>BARD</b> 1 beta led to growth arrest and correlated with various mitotic defects and disappearance of midbody localization of <b>BARD</b> 1 staining. Our data suggest a novel function of FL <b>BARD</b> 1 in Aurora B ubiquitination and degradation, opposing a proproliferative function of <b>BARD</b> 1 beta in scaffolding Aurora B and BRCA 2. Thus, loss of FL <b>BARD</b> 1 and up-regulation of Aurora B, as observed in cancer cells, {{can be explained by}} an imbalance of FL <b>BARD</b> 1 and <b>BARD</b> 1 beta...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Colon cancer {{predisposition}} {{is associated}} with mutations in BRCA 1. BRCA 1 protein stability depends on binding to <b>BARD</b> 1. In different cancers, expression of differentially spliced <b>BARD</b> 1 isoforms is correlated with poor prognosis and decreased patient survival. We therefore suspected a role of <b>BARD</b> 1 isoforms in colon cancer. METHODS: We performed immunohistochemistry in 168 colorectal cancers, using four antibodies directed against differentially expressed regions of <b>BARD</b> 1. We determined structure and relative expression of <b>BARD</b> 1 mRNA isoforms in 40 tumour and paired normal peri-tumour tissues. <b>BARD</b> 1 expression was correlated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: <b>BARD</b> 1 isoforms were expressed in 98 % of cases and not correlated with BRCA 1. <b>BARD</b> 1 mRNA isoforms were upregulated in all tumours as compared with paired normal peri-tumour tissues. Non-correlated expression and localisation of different epitopes suggested insignificant expression of full-length (FL) <b>BARD</b> 1. Expression of N- and C-terminal epitopes correlated with increased survival, but expression of epitopes mapping {{to the middle of}} <b>BARD</b> 1 correlated with decreased survival. Middle epitopes are present in oncogenic <b>BARD</b> 1 isoforms, which have pro-proliferative functions. Correlated upregulation of only N- and C-terminal epitopes reflects the expression of isoforms <b>BARD</b> 1 d and <b>BARD</b> 1 j.

40|$|<b>BARD</b> 1 was {{originally}} {{identified as a}} protein interacting with BRCA 1, the breast cancer predisposition gene product. <b>BARD</b> 1, like BRCA 1, has an amino-terminal RING-finger domain and carboxy-terminal BRCT domains. In addition, <b>BARD</b> 1 has three ankyrin repeats adjacent to the BRCT domains. <b>BARD</b> 1 and BRCA 1 form a stable heterodimer via their RING-finger domains. BRCA 1, like many RING-finger proteins, has E 3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is amplified when in association with <b>BARD</b> 1. By contrast, <b>BARD</b> 1 alone has no such activity. The binding of <b>BARD</b> 1 to BRCA 1 stabilizes BRCA 1 and, to some extent, <b>BARD</b> 1. <b>BARD</b> 1 and BRCA 1 are co-expressed in most proliferating tissues and are localized to the nucleus. Based mostly on its ubiquitin ligase activity, the <b>BARD</b> 1 /BRCA 1 complex has functions in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, chromatin condensation, cell-cycle regulation, mitotic spindle formation and cytokinesis. <b>BARD</b> 1 is highly conserved, having orthologs in many species. In mice, <b>BARD</b> 1 has essential functions during development, and <b>Bard</b> 1 -null mice, like Brca 1 -null mice, die between embryonic days 7 and 8, suggesting that the defect {{is caused by the}} lack of a functional <b>BARD</b> 1 /BRCA 1 heterodimer. Whereas only a few somatic and germline mutations of <b>BARD</b> 1 have been found associated with breast, ovarian and endometrial cancer, nine commonly found alleles of <b>BARD</b> 1 that contain single nucleotide polymorphisms {{have been found to be}} significantly associated with childhood neuroblastoma. In breast and ovarian cancers, truncated forms of <b>BARD</b> 1 derived by differential RNA splicing are highly upregulated and are localized to the cytoplasm.

40|$|The BRCA 1 -associated protein <b>BARD</b> 1 is a {{putative}} tumor suppressor.

The proapoptotic activity of <b>BARD</b> 1 involves binding to and elevations of p 53. BRCA 1 is not required for but partially counteracts apoptosis induction by <b>BARD</b> 1. A tumor-associated mutation Q 564 H of <b>BARD</b> 1 is defective in apoptosis induction, thus suggesting a role of <b>BARD</b> 1 in tumor suppression by mediating the signaling from proapoptotic stress toward induction of apoptosis...|$|R

40|$|The BRCA 1 -binding RING-finger domain protein <b>BARD</b> 1 may act conjointly with BRCA 1 in DNA {{repair and}} in ubiquitination, {{but it may}} also induce {{apoptosis}} in a BRCA 1 -independent manner. In this study, we have investigated <b>BARD</b> 1 expression during spermatogenesis. In contrast with BRCA 1, which is expressed only in meiotic spermatocytes and early round spermatids, <b>BARD</b> 1 is expressed during all stages of spermatogenesis. However, while spermatogonia expressed full-length <b>BARD</b> 1 mRNA, later stages of spermatocyte precursors express predominantly a novel, shorter splice form <b>BARD</b> 1 beta. <b>BARD</b> 1 beta lacks the BRCA 1 -interacting RING finger but maintains its proapoptotic activity. Consistently, BRCA 1 can counteract the proapoptotic activity of full-length <b>BARD</b> 1 but not of <b>BARD</b> 1 beta. Several lines of evidence suggest that <b>BARD</b> 1 is involved in proapoptotic signaling in testis: i) both <b>BARD</b> 1 isoforms are mostly found in cells that stain positive for TUNEL, Bax, and activated caspase 3; ii) <b>BARD</b> 1 beta, capable of inducing apoptosis even in the presence of BRCA 1, is specifically expressed in BRCA 1 -positive later stages of spermatogenesis; iii) antiapoptotic hormonal stimulation leads to <b>BARD</b> 1 downregulation; and iv) <b>BARD</b> 1 expression is associated with human pathologies causing sterility due to increased germ cell death. Our data suggest that full-length <b>BARD</b> 1 might be involved in apoptotic control in spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, while a switch to the BRCA 1 -independent <b>BARD</b> 1 beta might be necessary to induce apoptosis in BRCA 1 -expressing meiotic spermatocytes and early round spermatids...|$|R
