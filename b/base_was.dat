5|$|In 1981, Loring's bombers {{were placed}} on alert after Soviet {{submarines}} were spotted {{off the coast of}} the region. The <b>base</b> <b>was</b> briefly mentioned in the 1983 movie WarGames, although the film erroneously listed Loring as being home to the 43rd Bombardment Wing. In 1982, the <b>base</b> <b>was</b> hit by two earthquakes, which damaged the base hospital and caused cracks to appear {{on the walls of the}} control tower.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Canadian {{government}} {{announced that a}} research and fact-finding program initiated in 2005 had found the <b>base</b> <b>was</b> safe.|$|E
5|$|The <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{reactivated}} on 15 July 1961, but {{the only}} personnel based there were a fifteen-man firefighting detachment. By 1962, when the <b>base</b> <b>was</b> again deactivated, only 128 of the original 668 buildings remained. The General Services Administration (GSA) wanted to sell the base {{to the town of}} Wendover, leaving only the bombing ranges and radar site with the Air Force. The <b>base</b> <b>was</b> renamed Decker Field, and again declared surplus in 1972. The base continued to be used occasionally for training by Air National Guard units, and the firefighting detachment remained until 1977.|$|E

5|$|Travis {{was killed}} in the crash of a B-29 Superfortress at Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base near Fairfield, California. The <b>base</b> <b>was</b> named for him the {{following}} year.|$|E
5|$|A Soviet {{military}} <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{established in}} the current Šiaurės miestelis section of Žirmūnai during the 1950s. The heavily wooded northernmost part of the elderate was thinly populated until the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|As al-Mansur's {{persecution}} intensified, pressure {{began to}} mount on the brothers to react. Kufa, the traditional Alid <b>base,</b> <b>was</b> kept under close surveillance by the Abbasid government, {{and the two}} brothers resolved to launch a simultaneous rebellion in Basra and Medina. Although the Alids could count on a large network of sympathizers throughout the Caliphate, the action was rushed and lacked organization.|$|E
50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, a non-nucleophilic <b>base</b> <b>is</b> an organic <b>base</b> that <b>is</b> a poor nucleophile. Normal <b>bases</b> <b>are</b> also nucleophiles, but often chemists seek the proton-removing {{ability of a}} base without any other functions. Typical non-nucleophilic <b>bases</b> <b>are</b> bulky, such that protons can attach to the basic center but {{alkylation}} and complexation is inhibited.|$|R
50|$|Since a deductively closed {{knowledge}} <b>base</b> <b>is</b> infinite, complexity {{studies on}} belief revision operators working on deductively closed knowledge <b>bases</b> <b>are</b> {{done in the}} assumption that such deductively closed knowledge <b>base</b> <b>are</b> given {{in the form of}} an equivalent finite knowledge base.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} s-point-discrete weak <b>bases</b> <b>are</b> considered. Three {{necessary}} conditions that individually {{ensure that a}} space with a d-point-discrete weak base has a d-compact-finite weak <b>base</b> <b>are</b> given. We show that d-compact-finite weak <b>bases</b> <b>are</b> preserved by closed sequence-covering maps. It is shown that a space X is metrizable {{if and only if}} Xw has a d-point-discrete weak <b>base.</b> Conditions <b>are</b> given to ensure when a paratopological group with s-point-discrete weak <b>base</b> <b>is</b> metrizable. Several open questions are posed...|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the {{artillery}} bombardment at KSCB, an attack was launched against Khe Sanh village, seat of Huong Hoa District. The village, three kilometers south of the <b>base,</b> <b>was</b> defended by 160 local troops, plus 15 American advisers and heavy artillery provided from the base. At dawn of 21 January, it was attacked by a roughly 300-strong NVA battalion. Reinforcements were dispatched aboard nine UH-1 helicopters, but were wiped out after landing near the NVA, along with one helicopter. A small ground rescue force from the nearby combat <b>base</b> <b>was</b> repulsed, while the survivors from the village assault evacuated themselves to the combat base. The NVA fought throughout the day, into the next night, and finally completed the capture of Khe Sanh village at 09:30 on 22 January.|$|E

5|$|During the 60 {{years of}} {{occupancy}} by the Israeli army, the <b>base</b> <b>was</b> served by an army synagogue {{in one of}} the halls of the main building, including a Torah ark, bookcase, and a balcony door set with 12 stained-glass windows depicting the Twelve Tribes of Israel.|$|E
50|$|Junior {{borrowing}} {{base and}} senior borrowing <b>base</b> <b>are</b> {{calculated for the}} financial institutions and large corporations which have structured debt. In these cases, senior borrowing <b>base</b> <b>is</b> associated with senior debt and calculated of all assets. On the other hand, junior borrowing <b>base</b> <b>is</b> associated with junior debt and calculated of assets that are not already pledged for senior debts. Thus junior borrowing <b>base</b> <b>is</b> always smaller than senior borrowing base.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>Base</b> <b>is</b> the {{location}} from which primary logistics and administrative functions are coordinated and administered. The <b>Base</b> may <b>be</b> collocated with the Incident Command Post. There <b>is</b> only one <b>Base</b> per incident, {{and it is}} designated by the incident name. The <b>Base</b> <b>is</b> established and managed by the Logistics Section. The resources in the <b>Base</b> <b>are</b> always out-of-service.|$|R

5|$|Gibraltar {{was a very}} tempting {{target for}} the Italians, who {{saw it as a}} refuge for British {{warships}} and allied merchant shipping. The Italian frogmen originally used a Spanish villa (Villa Carmela) located two miles (3km) from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who had married a Spanish woman named Conchita Ramognino. Their <b>base</b> <b>was</b> shifted later to the Italian tanker SS Olterra, interned in Algeciras.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{the former}} <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{considered}} for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, {{as previous studies}} had found that 88 buildings were eligible for inclusion on the list, including the base's arch hangar.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1914, {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, a Royal Navy seaplane <b>base</b> <b>was</b> opened by the coast to defend the Thames Estuary naval towns against attack. It was at first used for both seaplanes and landplanes, but due to landing problems, a separate landplane <b>base</b> <b>was</b> opened in Manston in 1916. After the war, the seaplane <b>base</b> <b>was</b> decommissioned, and the landplane base in Manston eventually became Kent International Airport. During the war, the Coronation Bandstand was converted into sleeping quarters {{for use by the}} Royal West Kent Regiment. In 1925, the bandstand was refurbished and reopened as the 600-seat Westgate Pavilion theatre. By 1931, the town's population had reached 4,554. During World War II, several schools were evacuated to inland areas, with some, such as Streete Court School, leaving the town permanently. On 24 August 1942, a German fighter pilot, Herbert Bischoff, was captured after being shot down and crash landing in a field adjacent to Linksfield Rd, just south of the town.|$|E

5|$|Once a <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} at Jacquinot Bay {{it was used}} to support Australian operations near Rabaul which were conducted in early 1945 in conjunction with advances on the northern side of New Britain. The campaign was effectively one of containment as the larger Japanese force was isolated while the Allies conducted further operations elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|RAF West Ruislip was a Ministry of Defence site, {{located in}} Ickenham within the London Borough of Hillingdon. The <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{built as a}} depot for the Royal Air Force (RAF), split by {{what is now the}} Chiltern Main Line. North of the railway was RAF Blenheim Crescent, which housed the RAF Records Office and the depot's original personnel accommodation.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic {{methods were}} {{predominantly}} used by physicists and astrophysicists. Spectroscopic techniques were rarely taught in chemistry classes and were unfamiliar to most practicing chemists. Beginning around 1904, Frank Twyman of the London instrument making firm Adam Hilger, Ltd. tried to develop spectroscopic instruments for chemists, but his customer <b>base</b> <b>was</b> consistently {{made up of}} physicists rather than chemists.|$|E
