50|$|All {{classes are}} {{provided}} with a skill library that spans in both Sword and Magic-based spheres. Classes who are focused on one sphere, like Warriors or <b>Bladers,</b> will have all its offensive and support skills in it, while the other will be used only for common targeted magic spells and novice buffs, {{as well as an}} advanced one. Hybrid classes may use both spheres for different purposes; while Force <b>Bladers</b> develop only curses in advanced stages of the Magic sphere, Force Shielders possess some offensive unique arts in that sphere as well. Beyond offensive and support skills, there are also teleportation skills that all classes possess. Dashing is one that every character can use if they develop the necessary Sword sphere stage, which causes them to quickly dash a short distance and can be used in intervals to increase walking speed. Wizards have a unique teleportation skill called Blink which behaves similarly to Dash but is developed in the Magic sphere. Wizards are also the only class that can use both Dash and Blink and thus walk faster than any other class, effectively moving faster than even the rare vehicle items that exist in the game.|$|R

50|$|In North America, BeyWheelz {{was created}} {{due to the}} fact that Beyblade: Metal Fury episodes were cut to {{thirteen}} minutes from the 27th episode on, to share its time-slot with Cross Fight B-Daman. International versions of Metal Fury thus consist of 39 thirty-minute episodes, with the thirteen episodes of BeyWheelz completing the 52-episode season. This anime does not follow Metal Saga and instead takes place in a completely different universe where <b>Bladers</b> are called Wheelers and use BeyWheelz, wheel versions of existing Beyblades.|$|R
50|$|Subcultures may {{be based}} on age, geographic, religious, racial, and ethnic differences. More often, however, a {{subculture}} occurs when people with shared interests form a loose-knit group with a distinctive identity (sometimes called consumer tribes). Members of subcultures are self-selected, and signal their membership status by adopting symbols, rituals or behaviours that are widely understood by {{other members of the}} tribe (e.g. a dress code, hairstyle or even a unique way of speaking). For example, within youth culture it is possible to identify a number of sub-groups with common interests such as skaters and <b>bladers,</b> surfers, ravers, punks, skin-heads, Goths, homies and others.|$|R

From the WBBA headquarters, Ryo tells Gingka that Sol Blaze is the Orihalcon bey that destroyed Atlantis in the first place. Then, Ginga begins the trip to stop Sol Blaze, joined by Benkei, Masamune, Kenta, Madoka and Yu. They arrive in there by riding a helicopter. Then, Gingka convinces Helios to stop the rise of Atlantis, but Helios declines.

Then Bakin explains his complete plan. His plan was to use Pegasus and Blaze's power to drop Adonis on earth which would destroy all civilizations on earth. Then he would rebuild Atlantis on it. Everyone including Helios was surprised to hear Bakin's plans. Helios is completely stunned to understand that what he believed throughout his life was not true. Gingka and co. tried to stop Helios' grandfather but they get surrounded by Bakin's <b>bladers.</b> Helios decides to stop his grandfather's evil intentions. He uses Sol Blaze to take out Bakin's <b>bladers.</b> Gingka and Helios respectively launch Galaxy Pegasus and Sol Blaze to fight against Bakin's bey Dark Poseidon.
