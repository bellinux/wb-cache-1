50|$|In sewing, <b>bar</b> <b>tack,</b> {{also written}} bar-tack or bartack, {{refers to a}} series of {{stitches}} used to reinforce areas of a garment that may be subject to stress or additional wear. Typical areas for <b>bar</b> <b>tack</b> stitches include pocket openings, buttonholes, belt loops, the bottom of a fly opening, tucks, pleats and the corners of collars. Bar tacks may be sewn by hand, using whip stitches, or by machine, using zigzag stitches. The process for sewing a <b>bar</b> <b>tack</b> is essentially to sew several long, narrowly-spaced stitches along the line of the bar that will be formed, followed by short stitches made perpendicular to the long stitches, through the fabric and over the bar. The bar commonly varies between 1/16 to 1/8 in in width and 1/4 to 3/8 in in length. In some garments, such as jeans, the <b>bar</b> <b>tack</b> will be sewn in a contrasting color.|$|E

5000|$|A {{daisy chain}} is a strap, several {{feet long and}} {{typically}} constructed from one-inch tubular nylon webbing of the same type used in lengthening straps between anchor-points and the main rope. The webbing is <b>bar</b> <b>tacked</b> at roughly two-inch intervals (or, in the past, tied) to create a length of small loops for attachment. Unlike the use of similar devices in backpacking, daisy chains in technical rock climbing {{are expected to be}} of sufficient strength to be [...] "load bearing,". Daisy chain pockets however are not rated to full strength, and can only take static loads.|$|R
