The two men worked hard to capture {{the look and feel}} of the period as Fincher admitted, [...] "I suppose there could have been more VW bugs <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> show is a pretty good representation of the time. It is not technically perfect. There are some flaws but some are intended." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle was built in the old post office in the Terminal Annex Building in downtown Los Angeles. A building on nearby Spring Street subbed for the Hall of Justice and the San Francisco Police Department. Production began on September 12, 2005. The filmmakers shot for five weeks in the San Francisco Bay Area and the rest of the time in Los Angeles, bringing the film in under budget, wrapping in February 2006. The film took 115 days to shoot.|$|E

The other band members have also said that the show would be much more laid back and intimate for the fans which would show a different side to Steps. Lisa also said, [...] "We're going to do a mix of the new album and also our classic hits, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> would like to do is to actually have an alternative version with some of them so they're not necessarily the songs as you know them".|$|E

Obviously, {{there are}} many {{commentators}} who have conservative, liberal, centrist, and everybody understands that. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> {{is fair to say}} about FOX and certainly the way we view it is that it really is more a wing of the Republican Party." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> Jeff {{liked best}} of it all {{was the sort of}} public {{recognition}} that it meant.

I shall just motor my people up to Harrow and get back again by midnight." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{monologue}} {{began with}} a short time lapse of Craig coming out to start show through the last 10 years, starting {{on his first day}} (January 3, 2005) to his last. Craig thanked his comedic partner Josh Robert Thompson, the viewers, the crew, and explained: Over the years, going with this show out and around, or going and doing stand-up with Josh, I've come into contact {{with a lot of people}} who are viewers of this show, and although I said my goodbyes to the crew, the people who made this show are you. You came to a show that, let's be honest, was a bit of a fixer-upper. It kind of stayed that way, but what I hope we've done ... maybe art is a very grand word, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> managed to do here is make something that wasn't here before. So in that sense maybe it is a piece of art, it didn't exist and now it does. What we've done here, it doesn't go away because I stopped doing it, we stop doing this and we start doing something else ... maybe ... later, or maybe I go away and this is it! But I think what was more overwhelming than anything else in the experience of doing this show was making a connection with a country which I became a part of, which is astonishing to me. Even in the course of this show I became an American, officially and particularly for my friends at the IRS, I am now a fully-fledged American. However, what I can't be is a member of a club, which I didn't really ask to join, I wanted to do this show ... and now we've done this show, and if you will indulge me in whatever I'm doing now and come to whatever I do next I'd be very grateful, because my kids are still young.|$|E

60|$|I {{took out}} the {{photograph}} and tried, as it were, to think of my father as alive and with his eyes open. I couldn't remember the eyes. Jane {{told me they were}} blue; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> she said was the sort of impression the face produced upon me. A man not unjust or harsh in his dealings with myself, but very strong and masterful. A man who would have his own way in spite of anybody. A father who ruled his daughter as a vessel of his making, to be done as he would with, and be moulded to his fashion.|$|R

5000|$|On March 6, 2001, Jaroff, {{along with}} Edward, James Van Praagh, Sylvia Browne, Paul Kurtz and Shmuley Boteach {{appeared}} on Larry King Live {{to discuss the}} article. Edward claimed {{the details of the}} article were completely wrong, and indicated that if Jaroff had simply asked, he could have cleared up any misunderstandings. Edward admitted the show was edited for time but not content. Jaroff reiterated that he had attempted to talk with Edward directly, but was denied access. When asked directly whether Jaroff thought Edward and people like him are frauds, he responded by saying, [...] "Yes. I'm willing to say two things. One, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they're very good at <b>what</b> they do <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> they do is baloney." ...|$|R
5000|$|In September 2009, Gardner {{was ranked}} {{as the top}} quarterback {{prospect}} in the United States by Rivals.com. He was ranked as the No. 4 quarterback nationally by Scout.com and the No. 5 quarterback in the ESPNU 150. In November 2009, Allen Trieu of Scout.com said of Gardner:"He {{is considered one of}} the top handful of quarterbacks in the country and is firmly entrenched as a five-star prospect. As far as upside goes, I don't see many quarterbacks that have his potential. He has improved as a passer, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> is overlooked is that he has gotten faster and has broken longer runs. We've also seen several times where he has put this team on his shoulders and pulled out victories in tough situations." ...|$|R
5000|$|Telling history through things, whether it's an Egyptian mummy or {{a credit}} card, is what museums are for, {{and because the}} British Museum has {{collected}} things {{from all over the}} globe, it's not a bad place to try to tell a world history. Of course, it can only be [...] "a" [...] history of the world, not [...] "the" [...] history. When people come to the museum they choose their own objects and make their own journey round the world and through time, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> they will find is that their own histories quickly intersect with everybody else's, and when that happens, you no longer have a history of a particular people or nation, but a story of endless connections.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the first}} Democratic presidential debate in October 2015 the {{candidates}} were asked for their opinion of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. When {{asked the question}} [...] "hero or traitor?" [...] Sanders replied, [...] "I think Snowden played {{a very important role}} in educating the American people to the degree in which our civil liberties and our constitutional rights are being undermined. He did—he did break the law, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> there should be a penalty to that. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> he did in educating us should be taken into consideration." [...] Journalist Norman Solomon praised Sanders's reply saying, [...] "I think Bernie Sanders handled it the best in terms of scoping out and describing the terrain. And for the most part, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Edward Snowden would probably agree with what he said." ...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{performing}} in The National, Devendorf {{worked as a}} Book Publisher for Soho Press: [...] "was {{in the midst of}} the dot-com bubble and all that high-flying what-have-you, I was sifting through piles of manuscripts, looking for gold. ... I did get the opportunity to edit a few titles, start to finish. It was an invaluable experience all around." [...] In 2007, Devendorf worked at as a [...] "proofreader at an “interactive” ad agency," [...] while still {{performing in}} The National. He later noted, in 2010: [...] "My wife keeps trying to get on me to start writing again, but I’m just too lazy. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would do I wasn't in The National is be a Copy Editor, working on novels.

5000|$|The book {{contains}} 75 pages {{worth of}} {{comments from the}} YouTube music video. The majority of these comments are instances of people relating to the song lyrics. Many comments are memories of commenters, such as this one: “Love this song…I remember this song and dancing around singing it, stereo as loud as it would go…” A few times a series of comments appear as a conversation between two listeners, {{more often than not}} arguing about music. For example, one commenter wrote, “You claim this song is boring <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> you are missing {{is that it is a}} “Mood” song. It might not have interesting melodies and chord changes but to Add these you would Subtract from the “Mood.” Some of the best songs are the simplest and this you do not understand.” [...] Another disagreement ensues when one commenter states that they are a rapper and other commenters attack the original commenter’s career, claiming that being a rapper is a sad excuse for a career.|$|R
5000|$|Retina scanners, {{a form of}} biometrics, already existed by {{the time}} the film {{appeared}} in theaters, but media outlets have described the new advanced systems such as those by a Manhattan company named Global Rainmakers Incorporated (GRI) (2010), as similar to the movie's. GRI disputed the notion that its technology could be the threat to privacy it is in the film. [...] "Minority Report is one possible outcome," [...] a corporate official told Fast Company. [...] "I don't think that's our company's aim, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> we're going to see is an environment well beyond what you see in that movie--minus the precogs, of course." [...] The company is installing hundreds of the scanners in Bank of America locations in Charlotte, North Carolina, and has a contract to install them on several United States Air Force bases.It still can't work as fast {{as it is in the}} movie, but with the progress of computer technology, it is predictable to reach that level before 2054.|$|R

This {{marked the first time}} Israel sent a golfer to the Olympics. Due to Israel's inexperience representing golf athletes, Beck was required to procure all of her equipment to prepare for Rio, such as her uniform and hats. Israel's Olympic committee reimbursed her for the equipment. [...] On the topic of representing Israel at the Olympics, Beck said [...] "I think its because of what my grandparents had to go through, not just my grandparents but everyone during World War II, all the Jewish people during World War II and the holocaust, that obviously brings me anger, <b>but</b> <b>i</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> i'm trying to do is bring the anger and try to do something meaningful."

When Top Gear retired the Liana along with its rankings after the eighth series, Cowell was the eighth fastest overall and the third fastest non-professional driver. On 11 November 2007 Cowell yet again appeared on Top Gear, achieving a time of 1:45.9 thus putting him ahead of chef Gordon Ramsay and back {{at the top of the}} table. His time of 1:45.9 was then tied with English rock singer Brian Johnson of AC/DC and Grand Designs host Kevin McCloud for the second fastest time, just 0.1 seconds behind Jamiroquai singer Jay Kay. In March 2015, Cowell backed Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson after he was suspended by the BBC for punching a colleague, with Cowell stating on Good Morning Britain: [...] "He's apologised. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> is quite obvious is that the public are behind him, but you know, that's Jeremy." ...|$|R
