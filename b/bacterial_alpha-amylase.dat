L-PG consisted of alanine, glutamic acid, alpha, epsilon-diaminopimelic acid, muramic acid, and glucosamine. L-PG showed potent adjuvant activities for circulating antibody formation and development of delayed-type hypersensitivity to <b>bacterial</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> in vivo and for the primary immune response to sheep erythrocytes in vitro, as well as L-CWS. Both L-PG and L-CWS enhanced the generation of cell-mediated cytotoxicity in allogeneic mice and activated thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages and macrophage cell line RAW 264 to kill tumor target cells in vitro. We also found that L-PG acted on normal spleen cells as a mitogen. Both L-PG and L-CWS had tumor (Meth A) -suppressive and -regressive activities in syngeneic mice.

40|$|ABSTRACT A radial gel {{diffusion}} assay for endo-/ 3 -glucanase {{activity was}} used to evaluate various materials as potential enzyme sources in diets containing detrimental amounts of (3 -gIucan. Activity was detected in malt, two fungal sources (cellulase, pectinase), and two <b>bacterial</b> sources (<b>alpha-amylase,</b> a commercial enzyme supplement) but not in hog pancreatic alpha-amylase. Significant activity was detected throughout the gastrointestinal tract of 4 -week-old broilers fed an enzyme supplemented diet. Further, in vitro tests to determine the stability of a bacterial endo-/ 3 -glucanase revealed the following effects on enzyme activity: 1) a 58 % loss as a result of exposure to pif 1; 2) up to 36 % decrease after steam pelleting; and 3) stable after 10 -min exposure to a temper-ature less than 60 C.

40|$|Changes of {{viscosity}} {{characteristics of}} genetically diverse hexaploid wheat starches during pasting in water, 1 % NaCl solution, or at pH 4 or pH 10 were studied using a Rapid Visco-Analyzer. Peak viscosity (PV), hot paste viscosity (HPV) and cool paste viscosity (CPV) {{of all the}} wheat starches was little affected in pH 4 and pH 10 treatments. In 1 % NaCl, all starches showed substantial increases in all three parameters relative to pasting in water. The use of 1 % beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) (cycloheptaamylose) solution increased PV of high-swelling starches, but generally slightly decreased that of low swelling starches in all treatment conditions. HPV was always reduced by addition of 1 % beta-CD, but CPV was increased in most treatments for Anza and Yecora Rojo (low swelling), but decreased for Klasic (high swelling). <b>Bacterial</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> was added to starch or flour.

40|$|Chloride is the {{allosteric}} effector of vertebrate pancreatic and salivary alpha-amylases {{and of the}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> from Alteromonas haloplanctis. Activation experiments of A. haloplanctis alpha-amylase {{by several}} monovalent anions show that a negative charge, not restricted to that of Cl-, {{is essential for the}} amylolytic reaction. Engineering of the chloride binding site reveals that a basic residue is an essential component of the site. The mutation K 337 R alters the Cl [...] binding properties, whereas the mutation K 337 Q produces an active, chloride-independent enzyme. Comparison of the Kd values for Cl- in three homologous alpha-amylases also indicates that the binding affinity is dependent on the chloride coordination mode by this basic residue. Analysis of substrate and chloride binding according to the allosteric kinetic model shows that the chloride effector is not involved in substrate binding. By contrast, the pH dependence of activity and experiments of chemical modifications and Ca 2 + inhibition show that the chloride ion is responsible for the pKa shift of catalytic groups and interacts with active site carboxyl groups.

40|$|Chloride-activated alpha-amylases {{contain a}} noncatalytic triad, {{independent}} of the glycosidic active site, perfectly mimicking the catalytic triad of serine-proteases and of other active serine hydrolytic enzymes. Mutagenesis of Glu, His, and Ser residues in various alpha-amylases shows that this pattern is a structural determinant of the enzyme conformation that cannot be altered without losing the intrinsic stability of the protein. (1) H-(15) N NMR spectra of a <b>bacterial</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> reveal proton signals that are identical with the NMR signature of catalytic triads and especially a deshielded proton involving a protonated histidine and displaying properties {{similar to that of}} a low barrier hydrogen bond. It is proposed that the H-bond between His and Glu of the noncatalytic triad is an unusually strong interaction, responsible for the observed NMR signal and for the weak stability of the triad mutants.

40|$|Objectives: Enzymes are {{commonly}} used in the baking industry, as they can improve dough quality and texture and lengthen the shelf life of the final product. There is little published information highlighting exposure to enzymes (other than fungal alpha-amylase) in the baking industry, therefore {{the purpose of this}} study was to identify antibodies and develop assays for the measurement of a variety of such enzymes in samples of airborne flour dust. Methods: Polyclonal antibodies to bacterial amylase, glucose oxidase and amyloglucosidase were identified and developed into ELISA assays. The assays showed limited cross-reactivity with other enzymes commonly used in the baking industry. Results: We measured levels of airborne enzymes in 195 personal air samples taken from a sample of 55 craft baking establishments. We were able to detect amyloglucosidase in 9 % (16 / 184) of the samples, fungal alpha-amylase in 6 % (11 / 171), <b>bacterial</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> in 7 % (13 / 195).

Regardless of the strain difference in responsiveness to B alpha A between C 3 H/He (C 3) and C 57 B 1 / 6 (B 6) mice, the enhancing effect of CFA was characterized by an accelerated expansion of IEF spectra and by the intensified stain of focused antibody, compared with the response of mice immunized with the same antigen dose in IFA. The manner {{and the rate of}} heterogeneity expansion during the enhanced antibody response to a low dose in CFA were quite similar to the strictly restricted expansion of spectra during a response of a high dose of B alpha A in IFA, although each mouse showed an individual banding pattern with a different degree of heterogeneity, depending on the antibody titre.

Nitrate binds strongly to alpha-amylase but is a weak activator. Mutation of the critical chloride ligand Lys 300 into Gln results in a chloride-independent enzyme, whereas the mutation into Arg mimics the binding site as is found in animal alpha-amylases with, however, a lower affinity for chloride. These structures reveal that the triangular conformation of the chloride ligands and the nearly equatorial coordination allow the perfect accommodation of planar trigonal monovalent anions such as NO 3 -, explaining their unusual strong binding. It is also shown that a localized negative charge such as that of Cl-, rather than a delocalized charge {{as in the case of}} nitrate, is essential for maximal activation. The chloride-free mutant Lys 300 Gln indicates that chloride is not mandatory for the catalytic mechanism but strongly increases the reactivity at the active site.

40|$|The {{potential}} of surfactants {{for improving the}} yields of alpha-amylase during the solid substrate fermentation (SSF) of potato starch using pure and mixed cultures was examined. The microorganisms {{used in this study}} were Aspergillus oryzae ATCC 1011, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21556 and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332. The surfactants tested were Tween 20, Tween 80, SDS and surfactin. The fermentations were carried out in perforated trays after the addition of 10 % (v/w) inoculum and with temperature and humidity controlled at 30 °C and 90 % RH respectively. Samples were taken and analyzed quantitatively for the production of alpha-amylase and biomass and qualitatively by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a JSM- 840 A scanning microscope at 10 kV accelerating voltage. It was possible to increase fungal alpha-amylase production by as much as 6 fold in the process with the addition of either synthetic surfactants or the biosurfactant surfactin. The <b>bacterial</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> yields increased up to 11. 5 fold in with the addition and/or the co-culture production of surfactants. The highest enzyme activity was found in the fermentation of a mixed culture of the two Bacillus strains with the addition of Tween 80. During the SSF with B. subtilis ATCC 21332 and ATCC 21556 as a mixed bacterial culture, there was also the production of surfactin in yields comparable to those obtained in a submerged fermentation.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{intravenous}} (i. v.) administration of <b>bacterial</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> (B alpha A) on the IgG antibody {{response to a}} subsequent challenge with B alpha A in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) varied with the difference in responsiveness of the parental strains. High-responder C 3 H/He (C 3) mice given injections of either 200 or 4 micrograms of B alpha A, which alone were unable to trigger a detectable IgG antibody response, generated an enhanced response to an immunogenic challenge given 25 days after the last i. v. injection. The response of low-responder C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) mice previously exposed to B alpha A, following a different kinetic course depending on the exposing dose, reached a plateau lower than the levels of control responses (tentatively designated as high- and low-zone suppression). Prior exposure of (B 6 X C 3) F 1 hybrids to 200 micrograms led to the enhanced response, whereas pretreatment with 4 micrograms rendered them partially tolerant to a subsequent challenge. These {{results suggest that the}} capacity to achieve low-zone suppression is inherited as a dominant trait. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) analysis revealed that these enhanced responses expanded antibody heterogeneity in a strictly restricted, strain-specific manner as observed during the normal antibody response, although the rate of expansion was accelerated. The specific antibodies produced by individual high-zone suppressed B 6 mice were focused as a limited set of bands in a narrow pH range where the specific antibodies produced early in the normal response were focused.

40|$|The i. p. {{immunization}} with {{chemically modified}} antigen (dodecanoyl-bovine serum albumin, d-BSA) emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA) of CBA mice provoked delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), but not any detectable formation of antibody {{to the original}} antigen (BSA). Furthermore, {{it was found that}} immunization with d-BSA could generate T cells capable of inhibiting the antibody response to hapten on BSA, and the immunosuppressive effects of these T cells were presumably not due to direct action on hapten-primed and antibody producing B cells. These results were obtained from the following experiments: (1) anti-hapten antibody response to dinitrophenylated-BSA (DNP-BSA) was inhibited when the mice had been primed previously with d-BSA in FIA. This inhibition was regulated by the specificity of the carrier, since the mice treated with d-BSA did not inhibit the anti-DNP antibody response after the immunization with DNP-heterologous carrier, i. e. DNP-keyhole limpet haemocyanin (DNP-KLH). (2) The passive transfer of spleen cells, which had been obtained from donors primed with d-BSA in FIA, inhibited the primary anti-DNP antibody response of syngeneic mice after immunization with DNP BSA. (3) Injection of d-BSA-primed spleen cells suppressed an adoptive anti-DNP antibody response in mice which had been irradiated and had previously had their immunocompetence reconstituted by the cell transfers with both DNP-primed and BSA-primed spleen cells. This in vivo immunosuppressive effect of d-BSA-primed spleen cells did not act on hapten-primed B cells, since d-BSA-primed spleen cells could not suppress the adoptive secondary antibody response reconstituted by DNP-primed cells and <b>bacterial</b> <b>alpha-amylase</b> (BαA) -primed cells.
