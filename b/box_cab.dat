500|$|After a 20-year {{retirement}} {{from the film}} industry, O'Hara returned to the screen in 1991 to star opposite John Candy in the romantic comedy-drama Only the Lonely. She played Rose Muldoon, the domineering Irish mother of a Chicago cop (Candy), who has an indifference to Sicilians. The film reunited her with Anthony Quinn who plays her brief love interest, Nick the Greek. O'Hara stated of her return: [...] "Twenty {{years is a long}} time, but it was surprising how little changed. The equipment is lighter now, and they work a bit faster, but I hardly felt like I'd been away". She described Candy as [...] "one of my all-time favorite leading men", and was surprised by the extent of his talent, remarking that he was a [...] "comedic genius but an actor with an extraordinary dramatic talent" [...] who very much reminded her of Charles Laughton. In the following years, she continued to work, starring in several made-for-TV films, including The Christmas <b>Box,</b> <b>Cab</b> for Canada and The Last Dance, the latter her last film in which she played a retired teacher who suffers a heart attack, released on television in 2000.|$|E

40|$|Spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) are {{enriched in}} the Cajal body (CB). Guide RNAs, known as small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs), direct {{modification}} of the small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of the snRNP. The protein WRAP 53 binds a sequence motif (the <b>CAB</b> <b>box)</b> found in many scaRNAs and the RNA component of telomerase (hTR) and targets these RNAs to the CB. We have previously reported that coilin, the CB marker protein, associates with certain non-coding RNAs. For a more comprehensive examination of the RNAs associated with coilin, we have sequenced the RNA isolated from coilin immunocomplexes. A striking preferential association of coilin with the box C/D scaRNAs 2 and 9, which lack a <b>CAB</b> <b>box,</b> was observed. This association varied by treatment condition and WRAP 53 knockdown. In contrast, reduction of WRAP 53 did not alter the level of coilin association with hTR. Additional studies showed that coilin degrades/processes scaRNA 2 and 9, associates with active telomerase and can influence telomerase activity. These findings suggest that coilin plays a novel role in the biogenesis of box C/D scaRNPs and telomerase...|$|R

During filming in {{the summer}} of 1969, O'Hara was involved in an accident on set with Gleason when he tripped on a Cyclone wire fence, falling heavily on her hand which was resting on it. She later required orthopedic surgery to correct the injury. Though she got on well with Gleason, O'Hara remarked that it was a [...] "terrible film. The script was awful, and the director couldn't fix it". The film was poorly received critically, with The Guardian calling it [...] "the most mawkish film of the year/decade/era". In October of that year she made her last film with Wayne in Big Jake (1971), shot on location in Durango, Mexico. Director Budd Boetticher cast O'Hara as he believed that she and Wayne had chemistry which was [...] "head and shoulders" [...] over those of other leading actresses at the time. After Big Jake, O'Hara retired from the industry. In 1972 she professed to strongly disapprove of the way Hollywood was going, [...] "making dirty pictures", and she wanted no part of it. That year she was asked to give a speech at the Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony for John Ford, which was the last occasion she saw him before his death. [...] "There's only one woman who has been my friend over the years, and by that I mean a real friend, like a man would be. That woman is Maureen O'Hara.

40|$|The core {{components}} of telomerase are telomerase RNA (TR) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). In vertebrate cells, TR and TERT {{have been reported}} to associate with intranuclear structures, including Cajal bodies and nucleoli as well as telomeres. Here, we examined the time course of both TR localization and assembly of TR with TERT in Xenopus oocytes. The major trafficking pathway for microinjected TR is through Cajal bodies into the nucleoplasm, with a fraction of TR found in nucleoli at later time points. Telomerase assembly precedes nucleolar localization of TR, and TR mutants that do not localize to nucleoli form active enzyme, indicating that localization of TR to nucleoli is not required for assembly with TERT. Assembly of telomerase coincides with Cajal-body localization; however, assembly is also unaffected by a CAB-box mutation (which significantly reduces association with Cajal bodies), suggesting that Cajal-body localization is not important for assembly. Our results suggest that assembly of TR with TERT occurs in the nucleoplasm. Unexpectedly, however, our experiments reveal that disruption of the <b>CAB</b> <b>box</b> does not eliminate early targeting to Cajal bodies, indicating that a role for Cajal bodies in telomerase assembly cannot be excluded on the basis of existing knowledge...|$|R

The blushes of youth and good-humour mantled on the girl's cheeks, and played over that fair countenance like the pretty shining cloudlets on the serene sky overhead; the elder lady's cheek was red too; but that was a permanent mottled rose, deepening only as it received free draughts of pale ale and brandy-and-water, until her face emulated the rich shell of the lobster which she devoured.|$|R
40|$|Post-transcriptional pseudouridylation and 2 ′-O-methylation of splicesomal small nuclear ribonucleic acids (snRNAs) is {{mediated}} by box H/ACA and box C/D small Cajal body (CB) -specific ribonucleopro-teins (scaRNPs), respectively. The WD-repeat protein 79 (WDR 79) {{has been proposed}} to interact with both classes of modification scaRNPs and target them into the CB. The box H/ACA scaRNAs carry the com-mon <b>CAB</b> <b>box</b> motif (consensus, ugAG) that is re-quired for both WDR 79 binding and CB-specific accu-mulation. Thus far, no cis-acting CB-localization ele-ment has been reported for vertebrate box C/D scaR-NAs. In this study, systematic mutational analysis of the human U 90 and another newly identified box C/D scaRNA, mgU 2 - 47, demonstrated that the CB-specific accumulation of vertebrate intron-encoded box C/D scaRNAs relies on GU- or UG-dominated dinucleotide repeat sequences which are predicted to form the terminal stem-loop of the RNA apical hair-pin. While the loop nucleotides are unimportant, the adjacent terminal helix that is composed mostly of consecutive G. U and U. G wobble base-pairs is essen-tial for CB-specific localization of box C/D scaRNAs. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the newly identified CB localization element, called the G. U/U. G wobble stem, is crucial for in vivo asso-ciation of box C/D scaRNPs with WDR 79...|$|R
40|$|Large-eddy {{simulation}} (LES) is used {{to study}} the flow around a simplified tractor-trailer model. The model consists of two boxes placed in tandem.

Two variants of the model were studied, one where the leading edges on the front box are sharp and one where the edges are rounded. One small and one large gap width between the two boxes were studied for both variants. Two computational grids were used in the LES simulations and a comparison was made with available experimental force measurements. The results of the LES simulations were used to analyze the flow field around the cab and in the gap between the two boxes of the tractor-trailer model. Large vortical structures around the front box and in the gap were identified. The flow field analysis showed how these large vortical structures are responsible for the difference in the drag force for the model that arises when the leading edges on the front box are rounded and the gap width is varied...|$|R
