50|$|The most {{remarkable}} mechanical improvement was arguably the traction motors {{used on the}} new locomotives. They were known as <b>bipolar</b> <b>motors,</b> because each of the locomotive's 12 motors had only two field poles, mounted directly to the locomotive frame beside the axle. The motor armature was mounted directly on the axle, providing an entirely gearless design. This design was almost entirely noiseless, as it eliminated not only gear tooth growl, but also the whine of higher-RPM electric motors typically used in standard nose-mounted applications. The EP-2s were not the first electric locomotives to use <b>bipolar</b> <b>motors,</b> which had first been designed by Asa F. Batchelder for the New York Central S-motors over a decade earlier, {{but at the time}} they were the largest.|$|R

50|$|The <b>bipolar</b> <b>motor</b> {{is still}} in {{widespread}} use today, in medium-power, low-cost applications such as the universal motors used in home appliances such as food mixers, vacuum cleaners and electric drills.|$|E
50|$|This {{circular}} layout {{also represented}} {{the end of}} the <b>bipolar</b> <b>motor</b> as an industrial power source. It was possible to place a second set of field coils and pole pieces within the same size of casing, giving a four-pole arrangement. Because of the more efficient provision of field flux around the entire circumference of the armature, this give a motor of almost twice the power, for the same armature current. Armature current, and the associated commutator and brushgear, represented {{one of the most expensive}} parts of the motor to manufacture.|$|E
50|$|The {{complexity}} {{of this system}} was that the armature must now be free to {{move up and down}} relative to the field, as the suspension moves. With a contemporary four-pole motor, this would vary the pole gap at the upper and lower poles, probably {{to the extent that the}} armature hit the pole pieces (suspension travel being far larger than typical pole gaps). The solution was to return to the relatively antiquated <b>bipolar</b> <b>motor.</b> By placing the poles at the side of the armature and giving them flat vertical faces, the armature was free to move up and down between them. The motor design was relatively inefficient, even by the standards of the day, but these locomotives were designed for their power and haulage capacity with a generous supply of cheap hydro-electricity, rather than designed for efficiency.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bipolar</b> <b>motors</b> have {{a single}} winding per phase. The current in a winding needs to be {{reversed}} in order to reverse a magnetic pole, so the driving circuit must be more complicated, typically with an H-bridge arrangement (however there are several off-the-shelf driver chips available {{to make this a}} simple affair). There are two leads per phase, none are common.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the last}} {{industrial}} uses for large <b>bipolar</b> <b>motors</b> was for early railway electric locomotives. Many early electrics had used one or two large motors mounted on the locomotive frame, with drive to the wheels by traditional steam locomotive practice of coupling rods. The concept of using small, high-speed, nose-hung traction motors alongside each axle coupled through a reduction gearbox was not technically feasible given the technology available {{in the first two}} decades of the 20th century.|$|R

40|$|SummarySegregation of {{chromosomes}} at {{the time}} of cell division is achieved by the microtubules and associated molecules of the spindle. Chromosomes attach to kinetochore microtubules (kMTs), which extend from the spindle pole region to kinetochores assembled upon centromeric DNA. In most animal cells studied, chromosome segregation occurs as a result of kMT shortening, which causes chromosomes to move toward the spindle poles (anaphase A). Anaphase A is typically followed by a spindle elongation that further separates the chromosomes (anaphase B) [1 – 5]. The experiments presented here provide the first detailed analysis of anaphase in a live vertebrate oocyte and show that chromosome segregation is initially driven by a significant spindle elongation (anaphase B), which is followed by a shortening of kMTs to fully segregate the chromosomes (anaphase A). Loss of tension across kMTs at anaphase onset produces a force imbalance, allowing the <b>bipolar</b> <b>motor</b> kinesin- 5 to drive early anaphase B spindle elongation and chromosome segregation. Early anaphase B spindle elongation determines the extent of chromosome segregation {{and the size of the}} resulting cells. The vertebrate egg therefore employs a novel mode of anaphase wherein spindle elongation caused by loss of k-fiber tension is harnessed to kick-start chromosome segregation prior to anaphase A...|$|E

40|$|A {{reliable}} and efficient method {{to distinguish between}} chaotic and non-chaotic behaviour in noise-contaminated, but essentially stationary and deter-ministic, time series data has far reaching applications. Recently, we proposed a new method for detecting chaos which applies directly to the time series data and does not require phase space reconstruction. To illustrate {{the effectiveness of the}} method for experimental data, we analyse data from a <b>bipolar</b> <b>motor.</b> The standard technique to distinguish between regular and chaotic dynamics in deterministic time series data is to calculate the maximal Lyapunov exponent [1, 7, 14]. In the case of physical and biological applications, where the underlying dynamics is unknown, phase space reconstruction [1, 7, 16, 19, 18] is a necessary first step to compute Lyapunov exponents. However, there are problems inherent in phase space reconstruction as discussed in detail in [6, 17]. Recently, we proposed a new method [9] to detect chaos which applies directly to the time series data and does not require phase space reconstruction. Moreover, the dimension and origin of the dynamical system are irrelevant. The input is the time series data and the output is zero or one depending on whether the dynamics is non-chaotic or chaotic. This zero-one test for chaos is equally applicable to maps, ordinary and partial differential equations, and generally to data sets arising from deterministic systems. Of utmost importance is the effectiveness of the method for experimenta...|$|E
40|$|Kinesins {{from the}} bipolar (Kinesin- 5) family are conserved in {{eukaryotic}} organisms and play critical roles during the earliest stages of mitosis to mediate spindle pole body separation and {{formation of a}} bipolar mitotic spindle. To date, genes encoding bipolar kinesins {{have been reported to}} be essential in all organisms studied. We report the characterization of CaKip 1 p, the sole member of this family in the human pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. C. albicans Kip 1 p appears to localize to the mitotic spindle and loss of CaKip 1 p function interferes with normal progression through mitosis. Inducible excision of CaKIP 1 revealed phenotypes unique to C. albicans, including viable homozygous Cakip 1 mutants and an aberrant spindle morphology in which multiple spindle poles accumulate in close proximity to each other. Expression of the C. albicans Kip 1 motor domain in Escherichia coli produced a protein with microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity that was inhibited by an aminobenzothiazole (ABT) compound in an ATP-competitive fashion. This inhibition results in ‘rigor-like’, tight association with microtubules in vitro. Upon treatment of C. albicans cells with the ABT compound, cells were killed, and terminal phenotype analysis revealed an aberrant spindle morphology similar to that induced by loss of the CaKIP 1 gene. The ABT compound discovered is the first example of a fungal spindle inhibitor targeted to a mitotic kinesin. Our results also show that the non-essential nature and implementation of the <b>bipolar</b> <b>motor</b> in C. albicans differs from that seen in other organisms, and suggest that inhibitors of a non-essential mitotic kinesin may offer promise as cidal agents for antifungal drug discovery...|$|E

40|$|The heavily {{cross-linked}} microtubule (MT) bundles {{found in}} neuronal processes {{play a central}} role in the initiation, growth and maturation of axons and dendrites; however, a quantitative understanding of their mechanical function is still lacking. We here developed computer simulations to investigate the dynamics of force generation in 1 D bundles of MTs that are cross-linked and powered by molecular motors. The motion of filaments and the forces they exert are investigated as a function of the motor type (unipolar or bipolar), MT density and length, applied load, and motor connectivity. We demonstrate that only unipolar motors (e. g., kinesin- 1) can provide the driving force for bundle expansion, while <b>bipolar</b> <b>motors</b> (e. g., kinesin- 5) oppose it. The force generation capacity of the bundles is shown to depend sharply on the fraction of unipolar motors due to a percolation transition that must occur in the bundle. Scaling laws between bundle length, force, MT length and motor fraction are presented. In addition, we investigate the dynamics of growth in the presence of a constant influx of MTs. Beyond a short equilibration period, the bundles grow linearly in time. In this growth regime, the bundle extends as one mass forward with most filaments sliding with the growth velocity. The growth velocity is shown to be dictated by the inward flux of MTs, to inversely scale with the load and to be independent of the free velocity of the motors. These findings provide important molecular-level insights into the mechanical function of the MT cytoskeleton in normal axon growth and regeneration after injury.
