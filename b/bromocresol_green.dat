30|$|Peroxidases are {{oxidoreductase}} enzymes {{produced by}} most organisms. In this study, a peroxidase was purified from Hevea brasiliensis cell suspension by using anion exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sepharose), affinity chromatography (Con A-agarose) and preparative SDS-PAGE. The obtained enzyme {{appeared as a}} single band on SDS-PAGE with molecular mass of 70 kDa. Surprisingly, this purified peroxidase also had polyphenol oxidase activity. However, the biochemical characteristics were only studied in term of peroxidase because similar experiments in term of polyphenol oxidase {{have been reported in}} our pervious publication. The optimal pH of the purified peroxidase was 5.0 and its activity was retained at pH values between 5.0 – 10.0. The enzyme was heat stable over a wide range of temperatures (0 – 60 °C), and less than 50 % of its activity was lost at 70 °C after incubation for 30 min. The enzyme was completely inhibited by β-mercaptoethanol and strongly inhibited by NaN 3; in addition, its properties indicated that it was a heme containing glycoprotein. This peroxidase could decolorize many dyes; aniline blue, <b>bromocresol</b> purple, brilliant <b>green,</b> crystal violet, fuchsin, malachite green, methyl green, methyl violet and water blue. The stability against high temperature and extreme pH supported that the enzyme could be a potential peroxidase source for special industrial applications.|$|R

The dye decolorization was assayed following the modified method of Parshetti et al. (2012). The reaction mixtures were prepared in distilled water. One mL of reaction mixture, that contains dye, 0.001 M of H 2 O 2 and 25 units of the purified peroxidase, was incubated at room temperature and then the absorbance at the specific maximum wavelength of each dye was recorded at 24 h. The maximum wavelengths for the studied dyes were: amido black (620 nm), aniline blue (596 nm), brilliant <b>green</b> (626 nm), <b>bromocresol</b> purple (437 nm), bromothymol blue (434 nm), congo red (500 nm), crystal violet (590 nm), erioglaucine (628 nm), fast green (624 nm), fuchsin (543 nm), malachite green (617 nm), metanil yellow (444 nm), methylene green (664 nm), methyl green (632 nm), methyl orange (457 nm), methyl red (457 nm), methyl violet (584 nm), resazurin (600 nm), safranin T (521 nm), toluidine blue O (615 nm), trypan blue (595 nm) and water blue (596 nm).

30|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme from H. brasiliensis {{cell suspension}} was extracted, purified and characterized by determination {{of some of}} its biochemical properties and application in the dye decolorization. The results showed that the peroxidase was relatively easily purified through three steps, anion exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sepharose), affinity chromatography (Con A-agarose) then followed by preparative SDS-PAGE. The binding of the enzyme to the Con A-agarose column indicated that the peroxidase was a glycoprotein compatible with the previous studies reporting that most of the plant peroxidases were glycoproteins (Johansson et al. 1992; Kvaratskhelia et al. 1997; Passardi et al. 2005). Our purified peroxidase had a molecular weight of 70 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE while the molecular weights of various peroxidases have been reported to be in the range of 30 – 150 kDa (Regalado et al. 2004). A similar molecular weight for the purified peroxidase has been previously reported from Pseudomonas sp. SUK 1 (86 kDa), Leptogium saturninum (79 kDa) and Kocuria rosea MTCC 1532 (66 kDa), (Kalyani et al. 2011; Liers et al. 2011; Parshetti et al. 2012). The molecular weight of this obtained peroxidase was equal to those of the polyphenol oxidase previously characterized in our laboratory (Muhamad et al. 2012); however, at that time the peroxidase staining was not attempted. Now, the duplicated gels were stained with substrates of each enzyme and elucidated that it possessed the activities of both enzymes. By the mentioned purification procedure, the obtained protein also exhibited high activity of polyphenol oxidase inferring that it is a bifunctional enzyme. The bifunctional activity (peroxidase-polyphenol oxidase) also appeared in Satsuma mandarin, turnip and Brassica oleracea L. (Fujita et al. 1980 a, 1980 b; Rahman et al. 2012). However, the fact that whether our purified protein is a single protein chain exhibiting both activities of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase is being pursued to elucidate. In this report the enzyme was studied in term of peroxidase since our previous work has reported the biochemical characteristics of polyphenol oxidase enzyme (Muhamad et al. 2012). The optimal pH of the purified enzyme was 5.0 which were close to those reported from Jatropha curcas, Streptomyces sp. and L. leucocephala (Cai et al. 2012; Fodil et al. 2012; Pandey and Dwivedi 2011). For pH stability, its activity was retained at pH values between 5.0 and 10.0, and it had no activity at a pH < 4.0. Previous studies have reported that peroxidases lose their activities at low pH due to the instability of the heme molecule bound to the enzyme (Adams and Gorg 2002). Our purified peroxidase likewise contains heme groups since a peak of its spectrum was present at 302 nm (data not shown) which similar to the spectrum of other purified peroxidases containing heme groups (Gold et al. 1984; Kalyani et al. 2011; Tien and Kent Kirk et al. 1984). Moreover, the enzyme was heat stable over a wide range of temperatures (0 – 60 °C), and about 40 % of its activity was lost at 70 °C within 30 min. The heat stability of this enzyme was similar to the peroxidases isolated from Jatropha curcas, artichoke and Euphobia cotinifolia (Cai et al. 2012; Cardinali et al. 2011; Kumar et al. 2011). The effect of various compounds on this peroxidase showed β-mercaptoethanol strongly inhibited its activity. This results indicated that at least one disulfide bond within the structure was important for its activity. Schuller et al. (1996) has reported that Class III peroxidases are monomeric glycoproteins; containing four conserved disulphide bridges. Our peroxidase was also the glycoprotein which contains disulphide bonds; therefore our enzyme may belong to class III peroxidase. The NaN 3 could strongly inhibit this peroxidase. This chemical substance has been reported to be an inhibitor for all peroxidases (Pandey and Dwivedi 2011) as it can coordinate with the metal ion of a metal enzyme causing toxicity (Schwartz et al. 2001), for example, NaN 3 acts as an inhibitor on a peroxidase from Jatropha curcas and Viscum angulatum (Cai et al. 2012; Das et al. 2011). Our purified enzyme was slightly inhibited by EDTA, a chelating agent, like those from Jatropha curcas and Viscum angulatum (Cai et al. 2012; Das et al. 2011). In addition, SDS which is a strong anionic detergent slightly inhibited its activity probably due to a conformational change of the enzyme. The enzymatic decolorization of dyes by this purified enzyme was examined using a UV–vis spectrophotometer. The results showed that the enzymatic activity could decolorize the triphenylmethane dye group. Aniline blue, malachite green, methyl green and water blue were rapidly decolorized (83 – 97 %) within 24 h. This enzyme also decolorized brilliant <b>green,</b> <b>bromocresol</b> purple, crystal violet, fuchsin and methyl violet (49 – 68 %) within 24 h, and the residuals were then cleared within 72 h. Recently, {{it has been reported that}} many aromatics dyes can be decolorized by peroxidase through the precipitation or breaking of the aromatic ring structure (Husain 2010). Many previous studies have also reported that bacterial and fungal peroxidases from, for example, Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Bjerkandera adusta could decolorize dyes (Bumpus and Brock 1988; Mohorčič et al. 2006). However using microorganisms to decolorize dyes involves high costs, alternative sources such as plants are now being considered. Our purified peroxidase could react on extreme condition, so it may be used as an alternative enzyme to treat water pollutants. Our study provided a new perspective for the use of this enzyme or a related system in environmental biotechnology. Further studies will focus on the purification and characterization of peroxidase enzymes from other tissues of H. brasiliensis such as leaves and on the identification of the products obtained from the decolorization process by this enzyme.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. Pooled patient's serum {{selected}} {{to have a}} wide range of albumin concentrations was analysed for albumin by <b>bromocresol</b> <b>green</b> with both long and short incubation times and also by bromocresol purple. Total protein. colloid osmotic pressure. calcium and magnesium were also measured. There were strong linear correlations between albumin measured by the three methods. Albumin values by <b>bromocresol</b> <b>green</b> with a short incubation time (1 · 5 min) averaged 5 giL higher than those by bromocresol purple at all albumin concentrations. Colloid osmotic pressure correlated less strongly with total protein and with albumin by bromocresol purple than with albumin by the two <b>bromocresol</b> <b>green</b> methods. There {{were no significant differences between}} the correlation coefficients of calcium or magnesium with total protein and with albumin measured by the three methods. Bromocresol purple has no advantage over <b>bromocresol</b> <b>green</b> with a short incubation time for the clinical purposes for which albumin is measured: to detect abnormality. monitor change. predict colloid osmotic pressure and adjust calcium and magnesium for abnormal protein concentrations. A recent review of the measurement of albumin in serum and plasma concluded that bromocre-sol purple (BCP) is the dye-binding method of choice for analysers with individual channel calibration I because a major problem with <b>bromocresol</b> <b>green</b> (BCG) is the overestimation of albumin due to dye-binding by other plasma proteins. ?

40|$|Summary: The {{determination}} of serum albumin with the dye reagent bromocresol purple was investigated. We found that bromocresol purple {{is not a}} specific reagent for albumin, but that serum proteins in the a-, 0 -, and 7 -globulin fractions also react with this dye. Similar results were obtained for <b>bromocresol</b> <b>green.</b> Furthermore {{there is a great}} difference in absorbance between human and bovine albumin solutions (having the same concentration) when using the bromocresol purple reagent. Most probably this {{is a result of the}} difference in interaction of the reagent with the substrate. Although the standard curves with the bromocresol purple method were more linear (especially at higher albumin concentrations) than those obtained with the <b>bromocresol</b> <b>green</b> method, we still prefer the <b>bromocresol</b> <b>green</b> technique to the bromooresol purple technique, because its results are more comparable with those of other methods. Moreover in quality control and calibration procedures, strong deviations from the recommended values are obtained when non-human sera are analyzed with the bromocresol purple method.
