50|$|A bearer {{instrument}} is {{a document that}} entitles the holder of the document rights of ownership or title to the underlying property, such as shares or bonds. Bearer instruments differ from normal registered instruments, in that no record is kept of who owns the underlying property, or of the transactions involving transfer of ownership. Whoever physically holds the <b>bearer</b> <b>document</b> {{is assumed to be}} the owner of the property. This is useful for investors and corporate officers who wish to retain anonymity, but ownership (or legal entitlement) is extremely difficult to establish in event of loss or theft.|$|E

25|$|The {{shift toward}} {{the use of}} these {{receipts}} as a means of payment took place in the mid-17th century, as the price revolution, when relatively rapid gold inflation, was causing a re-assessment of how money worked. The goldsmith-bankers of London began to give out the receipts as payable to the <b>bearer</b> of the <b>document</b> rather than the original depositor. This meant that the note could be used as currency based on the security of the goldsmith, not the account holder of the Goldsmith-banker.|$|R
5000|$|The cédula de identidade, informally called cartão/carteira de identidade (identity card), [...] "RG" [...] (from Registro Geral, General Registry) {{or simply}} identidade in Portuguese, is the {{official}} national identity document in Brazil.

50|$|The {{area around}} Lake Constance, {{particularly}} the Linzgau, Hegau and Vorarlberg, came progressively {{under the rule}} of the counts of Pfullendorf from the 8th century onward. The earliest <b>documented</b> <b>bearer</b> of that name was Count Ludwig von Pfullendorf, who {{is referred to as the}} ruler of the county of Hegau from 1067 to 1116. Presumably, Pfullendorf expanded due to its proximity to the counts' castle. Count Rudolf, a partisan of the future Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, was able to expand his family's possessions and they eventually owned fiefs from the Danube to the Grisons. Following the death of his son Berthold in 1167, Count Rudolf named the Emperor as his heir and then moved to the Holy Land where he died in 1181.|$|R
60|$|The {{prisoners were}} then {{taken to a}} cell and searched with the utmost rigour. Their clothes were {{examined}} with scrupulous care, many of the seams being cut open and the linings slit, {{to see if any}} documents were concealed there. Their shoes were also carefully examined; but the mud had dried over the opening where the quill was concealed, and the officials failed to discover it. Even their sticks were carefully examined to see if they contained any hollow place; but at last, convinced that had they been the <b>bearers</b> of any <b>documents</b> these must have been discovered, the officials permitted them to resume their clothes, and then paying no heed to the angry complaints of Malcolm at the state to which the garments had been reduced, they left the prisoners to themselves.|$|R

The DHS will continue to consider additional ways in which a REAL ID license can or {{should be used for}} official federal purposes without seeking the approval of Congress before doing so. States remain free to also issue non-complying licenses and IDs, so long as these have a unique design and a clear statement that they cannot be accepted for any federal identification purpose. The federal Transportation Security Administration is responsible for security check-in at airports, so <b>bearers</b> of non-compliant <b>documents</b> would {{no longer be able to}} travel on common carrier aircraft without additional screening unless they had an alternative government-issued photo ID.|$|R

He returned to Bologna {{as a member of a}} deputation, to obtain from Eugenius IV an assurance that the pope would be present at the council. Having acceded to this request, Eugenius employed John once more to be the <b>bearer</b> of a <b>document</b> (dated 15 July 1437) to the Greek emperor in which the emperor's assistance was invited at a meeting of the council to be held in some Italian city. John's subsequent course has been a subject of dispute: some authors assert that he remained in sympathy with the council, while others insist that he allied himself with Eugenius IV, who made him Bishop of Argos. It is probable that he took the side of Eugenius.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is proper}} to state here a {{movement}} in the army, consequent upon the attempt by Pages to rescue Santa Anna. It was the wish of many, and was generally reported, that {{by a vote of}} that body, it was resolved to conduct the captive to headquarters, and place him before a court-martial. General Houston, then at Aies Bayou, being informed of these alleged proceedings, dispatched his protest against them. He Houston protested against it, because of all the advantages accruing to Texas by his Anna'scapture would thus be destroyed. The protest reaching the army, was sent to Columbia. A captain with his command had, just before its arrival, gone, as was said, after the prisoner, to bring him to the army; and the protest only reached Captain Patton, who had the captive in charge, in time to prevent his removal. Captain J. H. Sheppard, the <b>bearer</b> of the <b>document,</b> says the pleasant change of affairs filled Santa Anna with joy, and he embraced him as one who had saved his life.

2500|$|The Armistice {{was signed}} on June 22. Under its terms, {{two thirds of}} France was to be {{occupied}} by the Germans. On June 26 the British Ambassador in Madrid writes to London “The arrival of the Germans to the pyrenees is a tremendous event {{in the eyes of}} every Spaniard. [...] Will it mean the passage of troops through Spain to Portugal or Africa?” Meanwhile, Teotónio Pereira, following Spanish protests, declared the visas issued by Sousa Mendes to be null and void. The New York Times reported that some 10,000 persons attempting to cross over into Spain were excluded because authorities no longer granted recognition to their visas: [...] "Portugal announced that Portuguese visas granted at Bordeaux were invalid, and Spain was permitting <b>bearers</b> of these <b>documents</b> to enter only in exceptional cases." [...] The Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported that small Portugal, whose population was just over 7 million, had received an estimated 2 million applications for visas, permanent or transit. Most of them came from Frenchmen, Belgians, Dutch and Poles in France who required Portuguese visas to pass through Spain. The applications must have included tens of thousands from Jews.|$|R
50|$|The {{shift toward}} {{the use of}} these {{receipts}} as a means of payment took place in the mid-17th century, as the price revolution, when relatively rapid gold inflation, was causing a re-assessment of how money worked. The goldsmith-bankers of London began to give out the receipts as payable to the <b>bearer</b> of the <b>document</b> rather than the original depositor. This meant that the note could be used as currency based on the security of the goldsmith, not the account holder of the Goldsmith-banker. The bankers also began issuing a greater value of notes than the total value of their physical reserves in the form of loans, on the assumption that they wouldn't have to redeem all of their issued banknotes at the same time. This pivotal shift changed the simple promissory note into an agency for the expansion of the monetary supply itself. As these receipts were increasingly used in the money circulation system, depositors began to ask for multiple receipts to be made out in smaller, fixed denominations for use as money. The receipts soon became a written order to pay the amount to whoever had possession of the note. These notes are credited as the first modern banknotes.|$|R
60|$|I {{have been}} requested, by Lord Godolphin, {{to place the}} case of the bearer of this letter in good hands, and cannot better carry out his request than by asking you to act in the matter. Lord Godolphin has {{expressed}} himself most strongly as to the justness of his claim. The bearer's father was, he states, James O'Carroll, a noted rebel who was killed at the siege of Limerick. This alone would, it might have been thought, have proved a bar to any action on his part against the present possessor of the property; but he is the <b>bearer</b> of a <b>document,</b> signed by the queen herself, reinstating him in all rights he may possess, notwithstanding the actions of his father or of himself. It is not for me to make any comment upon the royal document, though I may say that I fear it may give rise to other suits, and alarm many loyal subjects who have become possessed of confiscated estates. However, we must hope that this will not be so, as it is expressly stated that, in this instance, the pardon and restoration of rights are given in consideration of services rendered by this young gentleman to Lord Godolphin himself, and to the Earl of Galway. What the nature of these services may have been does not concern me.|$|R

60|$|The active {{young men}} of our party had been on shore long before us, and seized upon all the {{available}} horses in the town; but we relied upon a letter from Halil Pasha, enjoining all governors and pashas to help us in all ways: and hearing we were the <b>bearers</b> of this <b>document,</b> the cadi and vice-governor of Jaffa came to wait upon the head of our party; declared {{that it was his}} delight and honour to set eyes upon us; that he would do everything in the world to serve us; that there were no horses, unluckily, but he would send and get some in three hours; and so left us with a world of grinning bows and many choice compliments {{from one side to the}} other, which came to each filtered through an obsequious interpreter. But hours passed, and the clatter of horses' hoofs was not heard. We had our dinner of eggs and flaps of bread, and the sunset gun fired: we had our pipes and coffee again, and the night fell. Is this man throwing dirt upon us? we began to think. Is he laughing at our beards, and are our mothers' graves ill-treated by this smiling swindling cadi? We determined to go and seek in his own den this shuffling dispenser of infidel justice. This time we would be no more bamboozled by compliments; but we would use the language of stern expostulation, and, being roused, would let the rascal hear the roar of the indignant British lion; so we rose up in our wrath. The poor consul got a lamp for us with a bit of wax-candle, such as I wonder his means could afford; the shabby janissary marched ahead with his tin mace; the two laquais-de-place, that two of our company had hired, stepped forward, each with an old sabre, and we went clattering and stumbling down the streets of the town, in order to seize upon this cadi in his own divan. I was glad, for my part (though outwardly majestic and indignant in demeanour), that the horses had not come, and that we had a chance of seeing this little queer glimpse of Oriental life, which the magistrate's faithlessness procured for us.|$|R
