This extension would follow a new alignment to Port Bolster, east {{of which the}} freeway would incorporate the existing two lanes of Highway48.

5|$|Peter N. Myhre {{stated in}} 2008 {{that the line}} would <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> the ski resort before the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, but no action was taken as neither Ruter nor the city council wanted to {{allocate}} the required 150million NOK.|$|E

5|$|The Marshlink line {{is one of}} the few in South East England {{that has}} not been electrified, and uses the British Rail Class 171 diesel rolling stock.

5|$|The Second Avenue Line trunk would <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> 149th Street {{to allow}} for a {{transfer}} to the Third Avenue Elevated.

50|$|SR 126 was {{originally}} designated in 1925 and ran between Lewiston and Richmond Corner. In 1929, the road <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> Jefferson. Shortly thereafter, it <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> its current terminus near Washington.|$|R
5|$|A {{variant of}} the {{extended}} version used in desert border patrol makes use of a high-ceilinged canopy to allow a swivelling rear-facing heavy machine-gun mount, while the canopy can <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> provide a mobile command post. An air conditioned hardtop version of the extended model is often used by officers, and a version developed for riot control has clear polycarbonate shielding along the rear sides and roof, as well as gunports for less-lethal weapons. The shielding allows for a wide field of view {{while at the same}} time protecting against firebombs and rock-throwing.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> {{construct}} all the circles that intersect three given circles at a precise angle θ, or at three specified crossing angles θ1, θ2 and θ3; the ordinary Apollonius' problem {{corresponds to a}} special {{case in which the}} crossing angle is zero for all three given circles. Another generalization is the dual of the first extension, namely, to construct circles with three specified tangential distances from the three given circles.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it would}} be {{utilized}} in both directions, {{the capacity of the}} proposed interstate loop line would be equivalent, it is said, to two 2-track lines or one 4-track line from New Jersey to New York City due to its having two crossings between New Jersey and New York. The loop was said to be able to carry 192,500 passengers per hour, or 4.62million daily passengers, had it been built. The estimate was based on the operation of 35 trains per hour in each direction, and each train would be eleven cars long and would carry 100 passengers per car. It was to be built as a multi-phase project, wherein the IRT and BMT would work together to build that system to New Jersey. Extensions of the IRT Flushing Line and BMT Canarsie Line were both considered; the Canarsie Line was to <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> Hoboken near the Palisades, while the Flushing Line was to <b>be</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> Franklin Street between Boulevard and Bergenline Avenues in Union City. Ultimately, the cost was too great, and with the Great Depression, these ideas were quickly shot down.|$|E

The branch line between Rajkharswan and Dongoaposi was amongst {{one of the first}} routes on the Indian Railways to be electrified with 25 KV-AC traction. The Bondamunda-Lathikata and Lathikata-Chandiposh sections were electrified in 1996-97 and electrification <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> Bimalagarh in 1997-1998. It <b>was</b> further <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> Barsuan and Rangra the same year.|$|R
