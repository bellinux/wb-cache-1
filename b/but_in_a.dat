5|$|A bushfire burnt {{through the}} area in December 1993, {{destroying}} the former railway's bridge over Clackline Brook. Clackline Bridge survived, weakened <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reasonable condition. The damage included internal expansion joints that had failed, split bedlogs, and other deteriorated timbers. Steel props were installed to support the bridge, and the substructure was repaired in 1995, which mainly involved replacing connecting bolts. A concrete approach slab was installed adjacent to the western abutment in 1998, and in 2013 the concrete deck near pier13 was repaired. Clackline Bridge was the crossing point for Great Eastern Highway until the highway's bypass of Clackline opened in February 2008. The bridge remains open to traffic, {{as part of the}} local road network. In July 2012 it once more carried highway traffic, excluding heavy vehicles, when an accident temporarily closed Great Eastern Highway at Spencers Brook Road.|$|E

He feared that, no matter which party prevailed in the open cabildo, it would take revenge against the other, the Mutiny of Álzaga being a recent precedent. He felt that the open cabildo would lack legitimacy if too many criollos were allowed to take part in it {{as a result of the}} aforementioned manipulation of the guest list.|$|E

Mifune also states that Maeda {{was one of the most}} vigorous promoters of judo, although not by teaching the art, instead generating recognition of judo through his many combats with contenders from other disciplines. Maeda treated experienced and inexperienced students alike, throwing them as if in real combat. He reasoned that this behavior was a measure of respect towards his students, but it was often misunderstood and frightened many youngsters, who would abandon him in favor of other professors.|$|E
5|$|As Tirpitz {{was still}} {{considered}} {{a threat to}} shipping, the British Chiefs of Staff Committee and the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided in late August to conduct further attacks against her using Royal Air Force heavy bombers. On 15 September, a force of Avro Lancasters attacked Kaafjord after refuelling at bases in northern Russia and inflicted irreparable damage on the battleship. Following this raid she sailed to an anchorage near Tromsø {{to be used as}} an immobile coastal defence battery. Another heavy bomber attack on 29 October caused only minor damage, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> third raid mounted on 12 November, Tirpitz was struck by several Tallboy bombs and capsized, sinking with heavy loss of life.|$|E

Cross remained in provincial politics until 1925, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> radically diminished role. After leaving provincial politics, {{he was elected to the}} Canadian House of Commons, only to be defeated in his 1926 re-election bid. He died in 1928.|$|E

He was arrested {{in the aftermath of}} a number of bomb outrages linked to his organisation, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> highly public trial where he faced charges of treason, Aurobindo could only be convicted and imprisoned for writing articles against British rule in India. He was released when no evidence could be provided, following the murder of a prosecution-witness during the trial. During his stay in the jail he had mystical and spiritual experiences, after which he moved to Pondicherry, leaving politics for spiritual work.|$|E

5|$|Because of his studies, he mainly {{played for}} Worksop's reserves, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> first-team match against Northampton Town {{he caught the}} opposition's eye and they offered him a contract, leading him to turn {{professional}} {{for the first time}} in 1901. He played for Northampton for the whole 1901–02 season, finishing as top scorer with 14goals in 22games for the club. During that season he had impressed in an FA Cup match against Sheffield United, leading them to offer Chapman a contract at the end of the season; Chapman accepted but dropped down to amateur status, wishing to make use of his engineering qualifications in the local area. He played 22matches and scored twice for United, but struggled to keep his place in a team full of internationals, and was sold to Notts County for £300 at the end of 1902–03. Chapman turned professional again, but only made seven appearances in two years for County, scoring once.|$|E

5|$|Bessell, {{anxious to}} be of service to his party's highest-profile figure, flew to Dublin in April 1965. He found that Josiffe was being advised by a {{sympathetic}} Jesuit priest, Father Sweetman, who believed {{that at least some}} of Josiffe's allegations might be true; otherwise, he asked Bessell, why had he flown all the way from London to deal with them? Bessell warned Josiffe of the consequences of attempting to blackmail a public figure, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more conciliatory vein promised to help recover the missing luggage and insurance card. He also hinted at the possibility of an equestrian job in America. Bessell's intervention appeared to contain the problem, particularly as Josiffe's suitcase was recovered shortly afterwards—although, according to Josiffe, letters implicating Thorpe had been removed. For most of the following two years Josiffe remained largely quiescent in Ireland, attempting to establish himself in various careers; part of this time was spent in a monastery. It was during this period that he formally adopted the name of Scott.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the fights}} between Troilus and Diomedes from the {{traditional}} narrative of Benoît and Guido take place {{the next day in}} Shakespeare's retelling. Diomedes captures Troilus' horse in the first fight and sends it to Cressida. Then the Trojan triumphs in the second, though Diomedes escapes. <b>But</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> deviation from this narrative it is Hector, not Troilus, whom the Myrmidons surround in the climatic battle of the play and whose body is dragged behind Achilles' horse. Troilus himself is left alive vowing revenge for Hector's death and rejecting Pandarus. Troilus' story ends, as it began, in medias res with him and the remaining characters in his love-triangle remaining alive.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge asked James Clay {{to protect}} his {{interests}} at the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina.

Fifty Southern Democrats, upset at the convention's refusal to include slavery protection in the party's platform, {{walked out of the}} convention; the remaining delegates decided that nominations required a two-thirds majority of the original 303 delegates. For 35 ballots, Douglas ran well ahead of Guthrie but short of the needed majority. Arkansas's lone remaining delegate nominated Breckinridge, but Beck asked that the nomination be withdrawn because Breckinridge refused to compete with Guthrie. Twenty-one more ballots were cast, but the convention remained deadlocked. On May 3, the convention adjourned until June 18 in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E

5|$|By June 30, air {{assets were}} being rallied against ground targets {{as well as}} aircraft. That day the 19th Bombardment Group was being used to bomb targets along the Han River. Meanwhile, the 3rd Bombardment Group bombed targets around Seoul, seeking to slow the North Korean advance southward from the newly {{captured}} city. These assets also attacked North Korean convoys and troop movements along the roads to great effect. During these attacks North Korean aircraft rarely opposed the US aircraft, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few occasions Yak-9 flights appeared, and in one instance engaged a flight of F-80s from the 36th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, allowing Lieutenants Charles A. Wurster and John B. Thomas to score a victory each. In spite of 25 bombing missions in Seoul, however, the North Korean troops were continuing their advance, forcing the US forces to abandon Suwon Airfield.|$|E
5|$|Christchurch {{was under}} heavy {{development}} at this time, {{as it had}} just been granted city status and was the new administrative capital of the province of Canterbury. This provided Mountfort and Luck ample opportunity to practice their trade. In 1855 they produced a preliminary design for the new Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings in timber. The buildings were constructed from 1857–59, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more limited form than the original design. As the Provincial Council gained new functions with growth in the population and economy of the province, the buildings were enlarged with a North wing in stone and an iron clock tower from 1859–60, and further enlarged with a stone council chamber and refreshment rooms in 1864–65. The buildings today are {{regarded as one of}} Mountfort's most important works.|$|E
