50|$|Many designs have {{increased}} portability by shrinking the altazimuth (rocker <b>box)</b> <b>mount</b> {{down to a}} small rotating platform. The altitude trunnion style bearing in these designs becomes a large radius roughly {{equal to or greater}} than the radius of the objective mirror, attached to or integrated into the tube assembly which lowers the overall profile of the mount. The advantage of this is that it reduces the total telescope weight, and the telescope's balance becomes less sensitive to changes in the weight loading of telescope tube from the use of heavier eyepieces or the addition of cameras etc.|$|E

25|$|At Route Markers, clue {{envelopes}} {{are placed}} inside a <b>box</b> <b>mounted</b> to the Marker. In early seasons, the box contained exactly {{the number of}} clues for teams on that leg, allowing teams to indirectly determine their current placement in the leg by counting envelopes. In more recent seasons, extra envelopes are left in clue boxes to prevent this from occurring.|$|R
50|$|Later, United Hatzalah {{standardized}} ambucycles—motorcycles retrofitted with {{a storage}} <b>box</b> <b>mounted</b> {{to the back}} of the vehicles—each of which contains a complete trauma kit, an oxygen canister, a blood sugar monitor, and an automated external defibrillator. These ambucycles contain all of the lifesaving equipment commonly found in an ambulance but on a vehicle nimble enough to weave through traffic, narrow alleys, or obstructed roadways.|$|R
50|$|At a cost {{of about}} £3.6m, and under the design of Sir Terry Farrell, the {{warehouse}} was transformed into The Limehouse Studios; a complex containing two studios of 3000 sq ft and 6000 sq ft with various associated production offices and post-production facilities. The two studios were contained in suspended concrete <b>boxes</b> <b>mounted</b> on independent giant springs to reduce external vibration, which was fitted out to the highest standards.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} NIDs {{are essentially}} just a specialized set of wiring terminals. These will typically {{take the form}} of a small, weather-proof <b>box,</b> <b>mounted</b> on the outside of the building.

50|$|The {{secondary}} radar system SSR750 {{as part of the}} joint military civil functionality could interrogate a transponder on board as aircraft for the height. This height, automatically derived from the onboard altimeter, was in the late 1960s and early 1970s shown to the operator on a <b>box</b> <b>mounted</b> above his screen. Later, with the advent of plot extraction it could be displayed alongside the aircraft on the traditional Plan position indicator (PPI) display.|$|R
50|$|Also {{referred}} to as a Baker's bike, however this style of freight bicycle was popular {{with a wide variety of}} trades during the first half of the 20th century, particularly in the United Kingdom. Typically, they would have a basket or storage <b>box</b> <b>mounted</b> within a framework which was fixed to the front of the bike. Often, they would also feature a sign advertising the business concerned, which would be attached within the main triangle of the bicycle frame.|$|R
50|$|Power and {{telecommunication}} services generally require entry points {{into the home}} and a location for connection equipment. For electric power supply, a cable is run either overhead or underground into a distribution board in the home. A distribution board, or circuit breaker panel, is typically a metal <b>box</b> <b>mounted</b> on a wall of the home. In many new homes {{the location of the}} electrical switchboard is {{on the outside of the}} external wall of the garage.|$|R
50|$|Zenith was {{the first}} company to {{experiment}} with subscription television, launching their Phonevision system with experimental Chicago station KS2XBS (originally broadcasting on Channel 2 before the Federal Communications Commission forced them to relinquish it to WBBM-TV). Their experiment involved a descrambler <b>box</b> <b>mounted</b> on the television set, and plugged into the telephone lead. When a preannounced broadcast was ready to begin, viewers would call an operator at Zenith who would send a signal with the telephone leads to unscramble the video.|$|R
50|$|Steering was by cam and lever {{with the}} <b>box</b> <b>mounted</b> on the car's frame. From 1932 the brake vacuum servo motor was {{run from the}} car's gearbox. Brakes were on all four wheels and {{operated}} by rods, drums were enclosed. The front brakes used the Perrott principle. The central hand lever used the same brake shoes at the back as the foot brake. Springs were semi-elliptical and flat with gaiters and shock absorbers. The rear springs were outside the frame.|$|R
60|$|As Jim Walsham and {{his companions}} were chatting {{in the shade of}} a boat, their {{conversation}} was abruptly broken off by the sight of a figure coming along the road. It was a tall figure, with a stiff military bearing. He was pushing before him a large <b>box,</b> <b>mounted</b> on a framework supported by four wheels. Low down, close to the ground, swung a large flat basket. In this, on a shawl spread over a thick bed of hay, sat a little girl some five years old.|$|R

2500|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{body was}} roughly a box, approximately 3.2 × 3.3 × 2.1m (10.5 x 10.8 x 6.9 ft) in size. The <b>box</b> <b>mounted</b> the 1.65m (5.4 ft) dish antenna and the GPHS-RTG radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) power source. [...] The box {{was divided into}} noisy and quiet sections. [...] The noisy section abutted the RTG; the quiet section housed the instrument electronics. [...] Particularly [...] "loud" [...] components, such as the preamps for the radio dipole, were mounted outside the structure entirely, and the box acted as a Faraday cage.|$|R
