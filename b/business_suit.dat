5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, Rashid Johnson exhibited The Evolution of the Negro Political Costume in December 2004. He presented replicas of three outfits worn by African-American politicians. He included a late 1960s dashiki worn by Jesse Jackson, a 1980s running suit worn by Al Sharpton in the '80s and a <b>business</b> <b>suit</b> worn by then United States Senator-elect Barack Obama. The presentation, which invited inspection, was as likely to evoke humorous response to the Jackson dashika as well as critical commentary about the presentation of political attire.|$|E
5|$|On June 19, 1969, Hendrix flew to Toronto for a {{preliminary}} hearing. He wore a <b>business</b> <b>suit</b> {{for the first}} time since before the formation of the Experience in late 1966. Judge Robert Taylor presided over the hearing, setting a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of possession of heroin and hashish, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. More serious potential charges of drug transporting and trafficking, which had been discussed at the time of the arrest, were not filed.|$|E
50|$|In men's fashion, black {{gradually}} ceded its dominance to navy blue, {{particularly in}} <b>business</b> <b>suits.</b> Black evening dress and formal dress in general were worn less and less. In 1960, John F. Kennedy {{was the last}} American President to be inaugurated wearing formal dress; President Lyndon Johnson and all his successors were inaugurated wearing <b>business</b> <b>suits.</b>|$|R

Danny and Morgan refuse to work for AJ further, finding him corrupt with power. AJ throws them out, and afterward he is promoted to CEO by a former officer—a decrepit man within a robotic <b>business</b> <b>suit.</b> AJ floats {{to the top of}} the suit, from which he spots a beach ball-destroying machine to the side. He hallucinates the beach balls as the heads of Morgan and Danny, who say that he has destroyed the spirit of summer. Realizing his mistake, AJ rejects the promotion. He returns to his friends outside, and together they plan the rest of their summer.|$|E
5|$|Allow Me, {{also known}} as Umbrella Man, is an iconic 1983 bronze {{sculpture}} by John Seward Johnson II, located in Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Oregon, United States. The sculpture, one of seven Allow Me casts, was donated anonymously to the City of Portland in 1984 for display in the Square. It depicts a life-sized man dressed in a <b>business</b> <b>suit,</b> hailing a cab and holding an umbrella. Constructed from bronze, aluminum and stainless steel, the sculpture stands six feet, ten inches tall and weighs 460 pounds. The sculpture {{is one of many}} works of art generated by the city's Percent for Art program, and is considered part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the Regional Arts & Culture Council.|$|E
5|$|Sinatra's {{funeral was}} held at the Roman Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills, California, on May 20, 1998, with 400 mourners in {{attendance}} and thousands of fans outside. Gregory Peck, Tony Bennett, and Sinatra's son, Frank Jr., addressed the mourners, who included many notable people from film and entertainment. Sinatra was buried in a blue <b>business</b> <b>suit</b> with mementos from family members—cherry-flavored Life Savers, Tootsie Rolls, a bottle of Jack Daniel's, a pack of Camel cigarettes, a Zippo lighter, stuffed toys, a dog biscuit, and a roll of dimes that he always carried—next to his parents in section B-8 of Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.|$|E

5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary <b>business</b> <b>suit,</b> and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E
5|$|There is {{capacity}} for 450 pupils in the Sixth Form, including up to 50 people {{from outside the}} Academy. Along with Carre's Grammar School, St George's {{is part of the}} Sleaford Joint Sixth Form, which was founded in 1983 and included Kesteven and Sleaford High School until it withdrew in 2010. It provides a common timetable across both sites and allows for pupils to choose from A-Level options offered at both schools. Pupils may apply to be based at either school, where their pastoral and tutorial activities take place.

25|$|In the United States and the United Kingdom, {{around the}} start of the 20th century, lounge suits were never {{traditionally}} worn in plain black, this colour instead being reserved for formal wear (including dinner jackets or strollers), and for undertakers. However, the decline of formal wear since the 1950s and the rise of casual wear in 1960s allowed the black suit to return to fashion, as many designers began wanting {{to move away from the}} <b>business</b> <b>suit</b> toward more fashion suits.|$|E
25|$|Blue {{gradually}} {{returned to}} court fashion in the 17th century, {{as part of}} a palette of peacock-bright colours shown off in extremely elaborate costumes. The modern blue <b>business</b> <b>suit</b> has its roots in England {{in the middle of the}} 17th century. Following the London plague of 1665 and the London fire of 1666, King Charles II of England ordered that his courtiers wear simple coats, waistcoats and breeches, and the palette of colours became blue, grey, white and buff. Widely imitated, this style of men's fashion became almost a uniform of the London merchant class and the English country gentleman.|$|E
25|$|The project allowed Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis {{to explore}} {{some aspects of}} the {{original}} films that they otherwise {{had not been able to}} in the past, such as the history of the Librarian ghost, and pursue some of the ideas left out of the original script, including the appearance of Ivo Shandor as Gozer, who was intended to appear in the finale of the film as the ghost of a man in a <b>business</b> <b>suit.</b> Other concepts used in the game, such as the alternate dimensions that open up during the latter half of the game, are based on the original Ghostbusters 3 concept Hellbent which was in development hell during the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|In clothing, a suit {{is a set}} of {{garments}} {{made from}} the same cloth, usually consisting of at least a jacket and trousers. Lounge suits (also known as <b>business</b> <b>suits</b> when sober in colour and style), which originated [...] in Britain as country wear, are the most common style of Western suit. Other types of suit still worn today are the dinner suit, part of black tie, which arose as a lounging alternative to dress coats {{in much the same way}} as the day lounge suit came to replace frock coats and morning coats; and, rarely worn today, the morning suit.

Both the cloak and scarf covered either a black double-breasted trench coat or a regular black suit. As seen {{in some of the}} later comics series, The Shadow would also wear his hat and scarf with either a black Inverness coat or Inverness cape.|$|E
25|$|From {{their arrival}} in 1922, the Crosbys led {{the life of}} rich expatriates. They were {{attracted}} to the bohemian lifestyle of the artists gathering in Montparnasse. They settled in an apartment at 12, Quai d'Orléans on Île St-Louis, and Polly donned her red bathing suit and rowed Harry down the river to the Place de la Concorde, where he walked the last few blocks to the bank. Harry wore his dark <b>business</b> <b>suit,</b> formal hat, and carried his umbrella and briefcase. Caresse rowed home alone, and in her swim suit her generously endowed chest drew whistles, jeers, and waves from workmen. She later wrote that she thought the exercise was good for her breasts, and she enjoyed the attention.|$|E
