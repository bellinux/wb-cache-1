5|$|The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species {{lists the}} Stresemann's bushcrow as {{endangered}} {{because of its}} very restricted range and loss of suitable habitat. The population seems to be declining rapidly and in 2007 {{it was estimated that}} there might <b>be</b> <b>fewer</b> than 10,000 birds remaining.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{great white}} sharks {{were added to}} California's Endangered Species Act. From data collected, the {{population}} of great whites in the North Pacific was estimated to <b>be</b> <b>fewer</b> than 340 individuals. Research also reveals these sharks are genetically distinct from other members of their species elsewhere in Africa, Australia, and {{the east coast of}} North America, having been isolated from other populations.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{concerns}} of the Irish discussed in the first letter was over what is now known as Gresham's law: debased coins would cause silver and gold coinage to be hoarded or removed from the country, which would further debase the currency. Tenant farmers would {{no longer be able to}} pay their landlords, and, after the tenants were removed, there would <b>be</b> <b>fewer</b> crops grown in Ireland; the increase of poverty and the decrease of food supply would completely ruin Ireland's economy.|$|E
50|$|There <b>were</b> <b>few</b> opera {{companies}} {{at all in}} the United States in 1958. Of those, there <b>were</b> <b>few</b> founded by women, and of those, there <b>were</b> <b>fewer</b> still with a woman serving as both conductor and dramatic director. She was certainly a leader, and a pioneer.|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} still very new to tourism. There <b>are</b> very <b>few</b> {{tourists}} on the island. There <b>are</b> <b>few</b> accommodations as well. There <b>are</b> <b>few</b> home stays and resorts. One {{of the most famous}} resort is Angthong Beach Resort.|$|R

5|$|Aubrey fought {{constantly}} {{with officials}} of CBS News, especially its chief, Fred W. Friendly, {{who was just}} as demanding and controlling as Aubrey. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs and in his memoir, Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control, recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey talked at length of how much money the news was costing the company, a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. However, Paley supported the news and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. Aubrey in 1962 ordered that there would <b>be</b> <b>fewer</b> specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition. Friendly resented this move.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010, Kieswetter {{achieved}} his target; {{some strong}} performances for the England Lions, {{especially in a}} match against the senior England team, won him {{a place in the}} squad to face Bangladesh. His selection, along with the presence of other South African-born players in the England team, was criticised; some commentators suggested there should <b>be</b> <b>fewer</b> foreign-born players in the team. Kieswetter scored his only international century in his third match, and a couple of months later he was the man of the match in the final when England won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. After a promising start for England, he was dropped owing to his inconsistency before the end of 2010. He returned to the team the following year, but his place was insecure, and in 2013 he was replaced by Jos Buttler, his teammate at Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds have streamlined, {{spindle-shaped}} {{bodies with}} reduced or non-existent external ear flaps, rounded heads, flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, and small tails. Pinniped skulls have large eye orbits, short snouts and a constricted interorbital region. They are unique among carnivorans in that their orbital walls are significantly {{shaped by the}} maxilla and are not limited by certain facial bones. Compared to other carnivorans, their teeth tend to <b>be</b> <b>fewer</b> in number (especially incisors and back molars), are pointed and cone-shaped, and lack carnassials. The walrus has unique upper canines that are elongated into tusks. The mammary glands and genitals of pinnipeds can retract into the body.|$|E
30|$|At low SNRs, {{where there}} <b>are</b> <b>few</b> valid {{combinations}} (as implied by FigureÂ  2), there will <b>be</b> <b>few</b> retransmission of network-coded packets from the relay. In this case, TCR and TNCCR {{are more or}} less the same.|$|R
50|$|In addition, the {{industry}} {{has been criticized for}} lacking in racial diversity. For example, critics have noted that there <b>are</b> <b>few</b> Asian plus size models. Others have noted that there <b>are</b> <b>few</b> black plus-size models with darker skin tones.|$|R
30|$|In addition, there <b>are</b> <b>fewer</b> {{academics}} claiming any difficulty when sharing, {{and this}} {{could be explained by}} the fact that there <b>are</b> <b>fewer</b> algorithms in their possession and thus a lower number of people who see problems in sharing is natural.|$|R
5|$|Referring to the {{character}} of the eruption and the rapidity of its development, modified smallpox occurred mostly in previously vaccinated people. In this form the prodromal illness still occurred but may be less severe than in the ordinary type. There is usually no fever during evolution of the rash. The skin lesions tended to <b>be</b> <b>fewer</b> and evolve more quickly, are more superficial, and may not show the uniform characteristic of more typical smallpox. Modified smallpox was rarely, if ever, fatal. This form of variola major is more easily confused with chickenpox.|$|E
5|$|When {{targeting}} livestock, {{the spotted}} hyena primarily preys upon cattle, sheep and goats, though hyenas {{in the southern}} parts of Ethiopia's Tigray region preferentially target donkeys. Reports of livestock damage are often not substantiated, and hyenas observed scavenging on a carcass may be mistaken for having killed the animal. The {{rate at which the}} species targets livestock may depend on a number of factors, including stock keeping practices, the availability of wild prey and human-associated sources of organic material, such as rubbish. Surplus killing has been recorded in South Africa's eastern Cape Province. Attacks on stock tend to <b>be</b> <b>fewer</b> in areas where livestock is coralled by thorn fences and where domestic dogs are present. One study in northern Kenya revealed that 90% of all cases of livestock predation by hyenas occurred in areas outside the protection of thorn fences.|$|E
5|$|There is a race {{prejudice}} {{that exists}} between the white and Negro races wherever the Negroes are found in large numbers.... Just this week the announcement comes {{as a shock to}} the people of Oklahoma that the Secretary of the Interior... has appointed a Negro from Kansas to come to Oklahoma and take charge of the supervision of the Indian schools of this State. There is no race of people on earth that has more antipathy for the Negro race than the Indian race, and yet these people, numbering many of the best citizens of this State and nation, are to be humbled and their prejudices and passions are to be increased by having this outrage imposed upon them... If your organization would interest itself to the extent of seeing that such outrages as this are not perpetrated against our people, there would <b>be</b> <b>fewer</b> lynchings in the South than at this time...|$|E

25|$|Lower {{fertility}} rates and an aging population, {{due to increased}} life-expectancy, brings new challenges to the Finnish health care system. As there will <b>be</b> <b>fewer</b> people {{to pay for health}} and social care, many of the aging population can be predicted to be affected. It is estimated that the old age dependency ratio in Finland will be the highest of all EU countries in 2025.|$|E
25|$|The {{flat-headed cat}} (Prionailurus planiceps) {{is a small}} wild cat native to the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Sumatra. Since 2008, it has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List due to {{destruction}} of wetlands in its habitat. It is suspected that the effective population size could <b>be</b> <b>fewer</b> than 2,500 mature individuals, with no subpopulation having an effective population size with more than 250 adult individuals.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, a German news investigative report {{claimed that}} in silk weaving industry, {{non-governmental}} organisations (NGOs) had found up to 10,000 children {{working in the}} 1,000 silk factories in 1998. In other places, thousands of bonded child labour were present in 1994. After UNICEF and NGOs got involved, after 2005, child labour figure is drastically lower, with the total estimated to <b>be</b> <b>fewer</b> than a thousand child labourers. The released children were back in school, claims the report.|$|E

25|$|In 1780 the United States {{had three}} major steam engines, {{all of which}} were used for pumping water: two in mines and one for New York City's water supply. Most power in the U.S. was {{supplied}} by water wheels (and water turbines during after 1840). By 1807 when the North River Steamboat (unofficially called Clermont) first sailed, there were estimated to <b>be</b> <b>fewer</b> than a dozen steam engines operating in the U.S. Steam power did not overtake water power until sometime after 1850.|$|E
25|$|In May 1992, Telemundo {{underwent}} another management change, appointing former Univision president Joaquin Blaya â {{who resigned}} from that network after discovering in an FCC filing for A. Jerrold Perenchio's {{purchase of the}} network from Hallmark Cards that Univision would increase its reliance on programming from Televisa and Venevision to levels that resulted in him concluding that there would <b>be</b> <b>fewer</b> opportunities for the addition of local programs on Univision's stations, and was subsequently joined by four other Univision executives â to head the network.|$|E
25|$|The various {{separate}} newsrooms for television, {{radio and}} online operations were merged {{into a single}} multimedia newsroom.

BBC World Service director Peter Horrocks said that the changes would achieve efficiency at a time of cost-cutting at the BBC. In his blog, he wrote that by using the same resources across the various broadcast media meant fewer stories could be covered, or by following more stories, there would <b>be</b> <b>fewer</b> ways to broadcast them.|$|E
