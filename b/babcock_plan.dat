5000|$|... 1922 - The first {{trade and}} {{technical}} programs were offered, {{and since that}} time, NDSCS has become widely accepted by employers from across the United States. Since 1922, NDSCS has followed {{the basic principles of}} the <b>Babcock</b> <b>Plan</b> and the North Dakota Plan. The original plan of four interacting curriculum divisions {{was the result of a}} survey conducted in 1921 by Dean Earl J. Babcock of the School of Mines of the University of North Dakota. In 1922, the North Dakota State College of Science was named the central trade and technical institution for the state of North Dakota. Under the North Dakota Plan, all trade-technical training in the state for many years was centralized in this institution — a method which proved very satisfactory in a state with sparse population and where agriculture continues to be the primary industry.|$|E
50|$|As a {{landscape}} architect, Babcock {{may be best}} known for her landscaping of the Arlington Street Church and her design of the MIT President's Garden and Great Court, where her work expanded on that of Elizabeth Greenleaf Pattee. <b>Babcock</b> <b>planned</b> a French-style gravel-covered court centered on a large statue of Minerva. However, when increasing traffic along Massachusetts Avenune shifted the campus's de facto entrance, the great-court design was replaced with streetside plantings of privet, oak and maple trees, and other plantings that would create a transition from the busy streets surrounding the campus to a quieter oasis within. MIT had only moved to its current location in 1916, and Babcock went on to become involved in the landscape design of the entire campus.|$|R
50|$|Republicans and <b>Babcock</b> {{denied any}} <b>plans</b> for a sales-tax or right-to-work law and placed their {{emphasis}} on Governor Babcock's business-like administration of reduced deficit and balanced budget without new taxes, current support for education and custodial institutions, and that agriculture was the only area of Montana's economy not prospering.|$|R
50|$|The {{facility}} {{started in}} 1993 with a $5.5 million {{gift from the}} George S. and Dolores Dore Eccles Foundation and included 59191 sq ft. An expansion, completed in 2001, added 40307 sq ft. The original structure cost $8.8 million. The cost of the expansion was $7.6 million according to an Open House brochure published December 7, 2001. Architect Dick Huss, AIA of <b>Babcock</b> Design Group <b>planned</b> the original structure and the addition. Oakland Construction Company served as general contractor.|$|R
50|$|Following the Kirkbride <b>Plan,</b> <b>Babcock</b> was {{designed}} not to include subterranean housing of patients. Each {{wing of the}} structure is 3-4 stories with rooms broken up into manageable wards. For its time, the building was heavily fireproofed. It also utilized, for a time, gas lighting. The building does not completely comply with Kirkbride standards. Babcock does not have staggered blocks within its wings, as would {{be seen in a}} true Kirkbride. South Carolina Lunatic Asylum head physician Dr. Trezevant successfully argued that the staggering of blocks would not allow the ventilation needed for the warm southern climate. However, against Trezevant's wishes, the halls were built in a double-range, with rooms {{on either side of the}} hallway.|$|R
40|$|Royer is {{surprised}} by <b>Babcock’s</b> proclamation and <b>plans</b> {{to consult the}} Attorney General and U. S. P. H. S. before taking any action; he has shown no desire to treat Pittsburgh like Lancaster, which he forbade all trains to enter• Part of Royer’s issued statement: “The proclamation of Mayor Babcock as reported to me by telephone sounds like an invitation {{on the part of}} the Mayor of a great city to invite lawlessness and disorder. It certainly cannot be in the interest of public health and public welfare. It is very unfortunate that on the eve of an election the Mayor of a great city should not stand solidly back of the state and show a greater willingness to enforce orders. ”Newspaper Article...|$|R
50|$|Carlyle and Babcock {{set up an}} {{experiment}} testing if salt was required in a dairy cow's diet. When one of their eight salt-deprived cows died, the experiment was halted. In 1901, Henry consented to allow Babcock to oversee {{an experiment}} comparing feed types, though he limited it to two animals and the experiment had inconclusive results. In 1907, after establishing a long-term testing <b>plan,</b> <b>Babcock</b> started the single-grain experiment. Cattle received rations from a single plant, though they were balanced so that each animal received sufficient nutrients. By the time the experiment ended in 1911, {{it was clear that}} the corn-fed group was significantly healthier than those fed oats, wheat, or a mixture of the three. The study was published that June and catalyzed the international study of nutrition.|$|R
2500|$|In September 1869, Babcock {{returned}} to Washington with a draft treaty of annexation. [...] President Grant's Cabinet was stunned, {{not knowing that}} <b>Babcock</b> had <b>planned</b> {{to draw up a}}n annexation treaty. Grant presented Babcock's informal treaty for his Cabinet to read, however, no Cabinet member offered any discussion on the treaty. Grant then asked Sec. Fish to draw up a formal diplomatic treaty, since Babcock did not have diplomatic authority. [...] Having not been consulted on the Dominican treaty process, Sec. Fish was ready to resign from the Cabinet, however, President Grant intervened having told Fish he would have complete control of the State Department, except for the Dominican Republic annexation treaty. Sec. Fish and Grant privately agreed that Fish would remain on the Cabinet and support Dominican annexation while President Grant would not support Cuban belligerence during the Ten Years' War. On October 19, 1869, Sec. Fish drew up a formal treaty; the United States would annex the Dominican Republic, pay $1,500,000 on the Dominican national debt, offer the Dominican Republic the right to U.S. statehood, and the U.S. would rent Samaná Bay at $150,000 per annum for 50 years. According to Grant's biographer, Jean Edward Smith, President Grant initially erred by not gaining U.S. public support and by keeping the treaty process secret from the U.S. Senate.|$|R
