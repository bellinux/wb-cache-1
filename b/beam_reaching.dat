40|$|The Einstein Cartan Evans (ECE) unified {{field theory}} is {{developed}} using {{the methods of}} dielectric spectroscopy {{to show that the}} effect of gravitation on electromagnetism is in general to create a spectrum. Therefore a light <b>beam</b> <b>reaching</b> a telescope after having passed through regions in which such inter-action takes place will in general have spectral properties such as dispersion, refraction and absorption. An objective unified field theory is needed to realize this, and so these effects are not present in the standard model despite being routinely observable as anomalous shifts and quantized shifts...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} rationally analyze RC beams under {{consecutive}} impact loading, a numerical analysis method based on three-dimensional elasto-plastic {{finite element method}} is proposed. An applicability of the method is discussed following two impact tests of RC beams: 1) consecutive impact loading test up to RC <b>beam</b> <b>reaching</b> ultimate state setting 1 m/s of initial and incremental impact velocity; and 2) two-time impact loading test with impact velocity around RC beams reaching ultimate state. From this study, following results are obtained: 1) impact response behavior of the RC beams for two kinds of experiments can be better simulated by using proposed method; and then 2) accumulated damage level and residual impact resistant load-carrying capacity can be better evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Caustics produce {{beautiful}} and intriguing illumination patterns. However, their complex behavior make them difficult to simulate accurately {{in all but}} the simplest configurations. To capture their appearance, we present an adaptive approach based upon light beams. The coherence between light rays forming a light beam greatly reduces the number of samples required for precise illumination reconstruction. The light beams characterize the distribution of light due to interactions with specular surfaces (specular light flux) in 3 D space, thus allowing for the treatment of illumination within single-scattering participating media. The hierarchical structure enclosing the light beams possesses inherent properties to detect efficiently every light <b>beam</b> <b>reaching</b> any 3 D point, to adapt itself according to illumination effects in the final image, and to reduce memory consumption via caching...|$|E

30|$|Multi-energy CT {{is a more}} {{specific}} material decomposition method available for research currently, but not yet available for use in clinical practice. The technique of multi-energy CT {{differs from that of}} dual-energy CT in that it uses the attenuation characteristics at more than two energies (i.e. multiple energies) and within narrow energy ranges [3 – 5]. The X-ray tube is typically operated at a single tube voltage to produce a broad spectrum of photon energies. The separation of the beam into energy bands happens within the detector, being energy-sensitive photon-counting detectors. An analogy with visible light is that this system is similar to taking a photo of a stained glass window using an ordinary camera. In this system the sun produces a range of wavelengths (or energies); the stained glass window variably attenuates this <b>beam</b> <b>reaching</b> the lens, and the camera's charged-coupled device chip separates the photons into red, green and blue channels.|$|E
40|$|Wildfires are {{uncontrolled}} exothermic oxidation of vegetation. Flame combustion temperatures {{could be}} in excess of 1600 K. Under the high temperature environment, plants' organic structure crumbles to release omnipresent alkali nutrients into the combustion zone. The alkali based compounds thermally decomposed to constituent atoms which ultimately ionised to give ions and electrons. The presence of electrons in the flame lowers its refractive index, thereby creating a medium of spatially varying refractive index. In the medium, incident radio waves change speed and are consequently deflected from their original path. The refraction has an effect of decreasing signal intensity at a targeted receiver {{which is at the}} same height as a collimated beam transmitter which is at a considerable distance away from the former. A numerical experiment was set to investigate the sub refractive behaviour of a very high intensity eucalyptus wildfire (90 MWmâˆ’ 1) plume using two dimensional (2 D) ray tracing scheme. The scheme traces radio rays as they traverse the plume. The ratio of number rays in a collimated <b>beam</b> <b>reaching</b> the targeted receiver to number of rays leaving the transmitter is used to calculate signal intensity loss in decibels (dB) at the receiver. Assuming an average natural plant alkali (potassium) content of 0. 5 %, attenuation (dB) was observed to be factor of both propagation frequency and temperature at the seat of the fire plume; and only of temperature at cooler parts of the plume. The 2 D ray tracing scheme predicted a maximum attenuations of 14. 84 and 5. 47 dB for 3000 and 150 MHz respectively at 0. 8 m above canopy-flame interface over propagation path of 48. 25 m. An attenuation of 0. 85 dB was predicted for frequencies from 150 - 3000 MHz over the same propagation distance at plume height of 52. 8 m above ground...|$|E
50|$|A proa has one sail, {{and is thus}} a catboat, {{though it}} is rarely called a catboat.
