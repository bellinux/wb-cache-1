50|$|A bleed-type manual boost {{controller}} simple {{mechanical and}} pneumatic control to allow some {{pressure from the}} wastegate actuator to escape or <b>bleed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the atmosphere or back into the intake system. This {{can be as simple}} as a T-fitting on the boost control line near the actuator with a small bleeder screw. The screw can be turned out to varying degrees to allow air to bleed out of the system, relieving pressure on the wastegate actuator, thus increasing boost levels. These devices are popular due to their negligible cost compared to other devices that may offer the same power increase.|$|E

The first set of flayers is the slaughterhouse workers charged with slaughtering the livestock. They use a captive-bolt pistol to knock down the slaughter stock. This {{is considered to be}} a humane method of slaughter in line with the Islamic laws governing the consumption of Halal foods for members of the Islamic faith. The study was informed that the use of the Halal method ensures that the slaughterhouse workers pronounce the name of the Almighty God, Allah, before severing the neck of the slaughter stock, leaving it to <b>bleed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> death and then detaching the head of the slaughter stock. Skinners are the second set of flayers, who open up the hide of the stock. The skinners also open up the carcass from the thorax to allow veterinary officers to inspect the organs and also remove the green and red offals.|$|E

50|$|The {{fact that}} sexual {{cannibalization}} happens so often is surely also {{caused by the}} fact that a male without a head can continue and even initiate copulation. It is believed that the cerebral ganglion might have an inhibitory effect on copulatory reflexes. Once it is removed by removing the head, copulation might even be longer since the male can never ‘decide’ to let go. A couple of mantids can also start copulating when the heads of both animal get removed artificially beforehand. The beheaded animals can live for up to five days and usually just die when they <b>bleed</b> <b>out</b> or starve <b>to</b> death.|$|R

40|$|For the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) at Fermilab 120 GeV/c protons will {{be transported}} from the Main Injector (MI) to an on-site {{production}} target. The lattice design and optics discussed here has the beam extracted vertically upwards from MI- 10 and the keeps {{the majority of}} the line at an elevation above the glacial till/rock interface and terminates on a target at 10 ft above grade. The LBNE beamline discussed here is a modular optics design comprised of 3 distinct lattice configurations, including the specialized MI {yields} LBNE matching section and Final Focus. The remainder of the line is defined by six FODO cells, in which the length and phase advance are chosen specifically such that beam size does not exceed that of the MI while also making the most efficient use of space for achromatic insertions. Dispersion generated by variations in the beam trajectory are corrected locally and can not <b>bleed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> corrupt the optics elsewhere in the line. Aperture studies indicate that the line should be able to transport the worst quality beam that the Main Injector might provide. New IDS dipole correctors located at every focusing center provide high-quality orbit control and further ensure that LBNE meets the stringent requirements for environmental protection...|$|E

It is a Quasi experimental study conducted at Govt Siddha Ayurvedic clinics functioning under vadamarachy area. A population of 90 patients both males and females between the age of 30 - 60 yrs were selected. Patients reporting with irritation and itching at the anus, constipation, bleeding after daefacation, burning sensation at the anal canal, aching discomfort and exacerbated by daefacation were selected for observation. Patients with thrombosed or strangulated haemorrhoids with acute pain, third degree piles remain outside of the anal canal margin and severe anaemia were excluded in this study. This choornam consist of Typhoniumtrilobatum based on a recommendation of Murugesamuthaliyar, Gunapadam –part - 1 and K. N KupusamyMudaliyar- Siddha Maruthuvam. Among the selected 90 patients were treated with this choornam at the rate of 5 gram for a period of 48 - 49 days by oral administration twice a day with ghee Continuous observation of the patients was done at weekends. With this observation was continued for 49 days. Continuous observations on signs and symptoms such as irritation, constipation, and itching in anal region were gradually disappeared among 80 % of patients at the end of two weeks. Other signs such as bleeding after defecation, burning sensation around the anal canal, discomfort and pain exacerbated by defecation were recorded in 70 % of the above 80 % of patients until 5 th week and these were disappeared gradually during 6 - 7 th weeks. 10 % of the patients were not corporate with the treatment.. Who observed all diet restrictions. But no significant changes were observed in 10 % of the patients of using this chooranam who ignored above food restriction. 10 % of the patients were not corporate with the treatment. The result reveals that this KarunaiKilanguthandu - choornam is the best healer of moolanoi and it ensured no any adverse effects among users in study area...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} the incidence {{and significance of}} recurrent postmenopausal bleeding among women diagnosed with an endometrial thickness <= 4 mm after a first episode of postmenopausal bleeding. Methods. Consecutive patients not using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) presenting with a first episode of postmenopausal bleeding and an endometrial thickness <= 4 mm at transvaginal ultrasonography (TVU) were managed expectantly. In case of recurrent bleeding, the patient was evaluated according to the hospital's local policy with TVU, office endometrial sampling, hysteroscopy or dilatation and curettage (DC) {{or a combination of}} these tests. We evaluated the incidence of recurrent bleeding, potential risk factors for recurrent bleeding, and the diagnosis made after recurrent bleeding. Results. A total of 607 patients were registered with a first episode of postmenopausal bleeding, of whom 249 had an endometrial thickness <= 4 mm. Follow-up took place with a median of 174 weeks (range: 4 - 250 weeks). During follow-up, 25 of the 249 patients (10 %; 95 % CI: 6. 6 - 14 %) had recurrent bleeding.
