5000|$|The Minch, a strait that {{separates}} the northwest Highlands of Scotland and the northern Inner Hebrides from the northern Outer Hebrides, {{is home to the}} <b>blue</b> <b>men.</b> According to lexicographer Edward Dwelly, in the Scottish Gaelic terms for the <b>blue</b> <b>men</b> - na fir ghorma, fear gorm and sruth nam fear gorm - the word gorm refers to any shade of blue and fear can be translated as [...] "man", na fir representing the plural [...] "the men".|$|R
5|$|Suggestions {{to explain}} the mythical <b>blue</b> <b>men</b> include {{that they may be}} a {{personification}} of the sea, or originate with the Picts, whose painted bodies may have given the impression of men raising themselves out of the water if they were seen crossing the sea in boats that might have resembled kayaks. The genesis of the <b>blue</b> <b>men</b> may alternatively lie with the North African slaves the Vikings took with them to Scotland, where they spent the winter months close to the Shiant Isles in the Minch.|$|R

500|$|The mythical <b>blue</b> <b>men</b> {{may have}} been part of a tribe of [...] "fallen angels" [...] that split into three; the first became the ground {{dwelling}} fairies, the second evolved to become the sea inhabiting <b>blue</b> <b>men,</b> and the remainder the [...] "Merry Dancers" [...] of the Northern Lights in the sky. The legendary creatures are the same size as humans but, as the name implies, blue in colour. Writer and journalist Lewis Spence thought they were the [...] "personifications of the sea itself" [...] as they took their blue colouration from the hue of the sea. Their faces are grey and long in shape and some have long arms, which are also grey, and they favour blue headgear; at least one account claims that they also have wings. The tempestuous water around the Shiant Isles [...] to the north of Skye, an area subject to rapid tides in all weathers, flows beside the caves inhabited by the <b>blue</b> <b>men,</b> a stretch of water known as the Current of Destruction owing to the number of ships wrecked there.|$|R

25|$|On November 9, 2006, Universal Orlando {{announced}} that the <b>Blue</b> <b>Man</b> Group would be coming to the resort {{in a new and}} theatre, which in May 2007 was named the Sharp Aquos Theatre. Construction of the theatre began shortly after the announcement. The theatre is contained within Sound Stage 18, which was occupied by Nickelodeon Studios from 1990–2005. The sound stage was home to shows such as Slime Time Live, Figure It Out, and Double Dare 2000.

25|$|Kellys in 1885 also {{recorded}} the Duke of Rutland KG as {{lord of the}} manor and chief landowner. Within the village were a boot-and-shoe maker, two shopkeepers-cum-carriers, a shoemakers with post office, a butcher-cum-grocer, two carpenters, two tailors, two shopkeepers, a blacksmith, a baker-cum-beer retailer, two farmers, a butcher-cum-farmer, and a homoeopathist. There were two public houses, the Rutland Arms and the Chequers, and a ladies boarding and day school. Living in the village was a gamekeeper and a farm bailiff, both in the employ of the Duke of Rutland, and a surgeon medical officer who was public vaccinator for the Denton district and Grantham Union. Five carriers from the village delivered to Grantham's <b>Blue</b> <b>Man,</b> Blue Ram, and Blue Bull public houses.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just {{below the surface of the}} water. The <b>blue</b> <b>men</b> swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the <b>blue</b> <b>men</b> will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|R
5000|$|Mackenzie's {{explanation}} of {{the legend of the}} <b>blue</b> <b>men</b> was based partly on research into the Annals of Ireland and goes back to the times of Harald Fairhair, the first Norse king, and his battles against the Vikings. The Scottish Gaelic term fear gorm, meaning [...] "blue men", is the descriptor for a negro according to Dwelly. Thus sruth nam fear gorm, one of the blue men's Gaelic names, literally translates as [...] "stream of the blue men", or [...] "river, tide or stream of the blue negro". Around the 9th century the Vikings took Moors they had captured and were using as slaves to Ireland. The Vikings spent winter months near the Shiant Isles, and Mackenzie attributes the story of the <b>blue</b> <b>men</b> to [...] "marooned foreign slaves". He quotes an excerpt from historian Alan Orr Anderson's Early sources of Scottish history, A.D. 500 to 1286: These were the <b>blue</b> <b>men</b> fir gorma, because Moors are the same as negroes; Mauritania is the same as negro-land the same as blackness. More recent newspaper reports have repeated Mackenzie's hypothesis. Historian Malcolm Archibald agrees the legend originates from the days Norsemen had North African slaves, but speculates that the myth may have originated with the Tuareg people of Saharan Africa, who were known as the [...] "blue men of the desert".|$|R
