60|$|La Boulaye searched {{a drawer}} of his writing-table for the <b>blank</b> <b>passport</b> he required. Having found it, he {{hesitated for a}} moment how to fill it in. At last he decided, and set down three names--Pierre, Francois, and Julie Michael, players, going to Strasbourg--to which he added {{descriptions}} of himself, the Vicomte, and Mademoiselle. He reasoned that in case it should ultimately prove impossible for him to accompany them, the passport, thus indited, would still do duty for the other two. They could easily advance some excuse why the third person mentioned was not accompanying them. From this it will be seen that La Boulaye was far from having abandoned hope of effecting his escape, either by his own resourcefulness or by the favour of Robespierre himself, whose kindness for him, after all, was a factor worth reckoning upon.|$|E
60|$|Thus resigning {{the charge}} of the Marquis to his new confederate, Dalgetty pressed the spring, by which the secret door flew open, though so well were its hinges {{polished}} and oiled, that it made not the slightest noise in revolving. The {{opposite side of the}} door was secured by very strong bolts and bars, beside which hung one or two keys, designed apparently to undo fetterlocks. A narrow staircase, ascending up through the thickness of the castle-wall, landed, as the Marquis had truly informed him, behind the tapestry of his private apartment. Such communications were frequent in old feudal castles, as they gave the lord of the fortress, like a second Dionysius, the means of hearing the conversation of his prisoners, or, if he pleased, of visiting them in disguise, an experiment which had terminated so unpleasantly on the present occasion for Gillespie Grumach. Having examined previously whether there was any one in the apartment, and finding the coast clear, the Captain entered, and hastily possessing himself of a <b>blank</b> <b>passport,</b> several of which lay on the table, and of writing materials, securing, at the same time, the Marquis's dagger, and a silk cord from the hangings, he again descended into the cavern, where, listening a moment at the door, he could hear the half-stifled voice of the Marquis making great proffers to MacEagh, on condition he would suffer him to give an alarm.|$|E
50|$|On {{the advice}} of Alexander von Humboldt, he turned his {{attention}} to Oriental Russia, and, having received a remarkable <b>blank</b> <b>passport</b> from Nicholas I of Russia, he set out in January 1847 on the first of many journeys throughout Siberia and Central Asia. This first journey saw him visit the Urals, the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia and the northern Kazakh Steppes. He returned briefly to Moscow in February 1848 where he married Lucy Sherrard Finley, an Englishwoman who had been a governess in a noble Russian family in St Petersburg. Two days later he set off again for Siberia, accompanied by his newly married wife. Their travels extended over 39,500 miles, and occupied them until the end of 1853. His avowed aim in these expeditions was to sketch the scenery of Siberia, and he brought back over 500 clever watercolours - some of them five or six feet square - and drawings. Many were of places that were completely unknown to Europeans. He kept detailed journals of his explorations, which were written with much power and freshness.|$|E

He unwillingly allows Dave Klein to keep his job, despite Klein's obvious corruption. Exley continues his crusade in attempting to take down Dudley Smith. He uses an undercover police cadet and Klein to attain this goal. During a burglary into Exley's house by Klein for monetary gain, he finds numerous photos of Dudley Smith. Klein coins the photos [...] "Exley hate fuel." [...] During an earlier meeting at Exley's house, Klein mentions that as evil as Dudley is, Exley is a hypocrite in the way he uses people like Dudley. White Jazz sees the end of the corrupt Narcotics Division and its sanctioned dealers, the Kafesjians. Due to severe brain damage and wounds, Dudley remains in hospital care his whole life and a special pension fund approved by Exley himself, since the revelations about the LAPD's blatant corruption would [...] "bring the LAPD to its knees," [...] as stated in Hush-Hush. With Klein a fugitive, Exley gets word to him in a package. It states he will not pursue Klein for his burglary because he used Klein to accomplish his mission.

5000|$|The {{fourth and}} final novel in the L.A. Quartet is White Jazz, told from corrupt LAPD officer Dave Klein's point of view. As a policeman, Klein has broken the law {{numerous}} times, beat suspects, stolen, bribed, worked for the mob, and had people killed, {{as well as being}} a murderer himself. In late 1958, Klein, the commander of Administrative Vice, is assigned a burglary of the sanctioned drug-dealing family, the Kafesjians. Despite not seeing the case as a priority, the Narcotics Division commander Dan Wilhite and Deputy Chief Ed Exley want the case solved. He takes a sideline job from Howard Hughes, who wants Klein to find evidence that would violate an actress's contract. Klein takes the job, but falls in love with his target, Glenda Bledsoe. All while working the Kafesjian burglary, Klein discovers that Exley is still trying to bring down Dudley Smith. When he figures it out, Klein begins working with Exley, who tells him all about Dudley. When Klein meets an undercover officer, Johnny Duhamel, who is working Smith on behalf of Exley, Klein is shot up with drugs. Being coerced, Klein murders Duhamel with his Marine sword and is taped committing the murder. Klein is arrested by the FBI the following day for possession of heroin. Klein becomes a federal witness, but is given 48 hours before he is taken into custody. Klein and Exley discover other Dudley Smith sidelines, selling heroin exclusively to the South Los Angeles African-American population, keeping crime in that area [...] "contained", gambling, and voyeuristic pornography tapes. Klein and Exley find the Kafesjians' burglar, Wylie Bullock. Later that night, everything hits Klein: all his crimes and everything that is happening. He decides to meet Smith later that night, who offered Klein a deal earlier. Unbeknownst to Smith, Klein brings Wylie Bullock, who has a grudge against Smith. When the two meet, Bullock attacks Smith, ripping out his eye and slashing his face ear to ear. Klein shoots Bullock and runs off. An all-points bulletin is issued on Klein and he is caught. A custody battle ensues between the FBI and the LAPD for Klein, which the FBI wins. While in federal custody, Klein writes a full confession of everything he has done, and everything that has happened. He has copies sent to Hush-Hush, the Los Angeles Times, and the State Attorney General's Office. However, Klein escapes custody.

The notice listed some additional grounds for granting of an SPLP: Indonesian SPLPs would be issued to Indonesians living as illegal immigrants in other countries, as well as in the event of depletion of stocks of <b>blank</b> <b>passports,</b> while Alien SPLPs would be issued to former Indonesian citizens who had lost citizenship under Article 17(k) of Act No. 62 of 1958 and wanted to travel to Indonesia in order to regain Indonesian citizenship.|$|R

50|$|Kolbe was {{influenced}} by surgeon Ferdinand Sauerbruch and around November 1941, became determined to actively help defeat the Nazis. Realizing {{the importance of the}} information for which he had access, Kolbe tried to make contact with the United States Embassy in Berlin in late 1941, prior to their declaration of war following the Pearl Harbor attack and the closing of the embassy. The longer he was in Berlin, the more Kolbe disliked the Hitler regime and their actions. He sought diplomatic assignments outside of Germany, one of which was consulate general at Stavanger, Norway, but was unsuccessful because he would not join the Nazi party. With <b>blank</b> <b>passports</b> that he had brought with him from Cape Town, he was able to help some Jewish people escape Nazi Germany. Kolbe passed information gleaned from cables to the French Resistance, particularly when it could save someone's life or prevent an arrest, {{as in the case of}} Cardinal Gerlier. He collaborated with Dr. Adolphe Jung for Free France, using Jung's office to process Foreign Office documents and providing information to Jung who relayed it to the French Resistance.

40|$|Under the {{influence}} of intelligence-led policing models, crime analysis methods have known of important developments in recent years. Applications have been proposed in several fields of forensic science to exploit and manage various types of material evidence in a systematic and more efficient way. However, nothing has been suggested {{so far in the}} field of false identity documents. This study seeks to fill this gap by proposing a simple and general method for profiling false identity documents which aims to establish links based on their visual forensic characteristics. A sample of more than 200 false identity documents including French stolen <b>blank</b> <b>passports,</b> counterfeited driving licenses from Iraq and falsified Bulgarian driving licenses was gathered from nine Swiss police departments and integrated into an ad hoc developed database called ProfID. Links detected automatically and systematically through this database were exploited and analyzed to produce strategic and tactical intelligence useful to the fight against identity document fraud. The profiling and intelligence process established for these three types of false identity documents has confirmed its efficiency, more than 30 % of documents being linked. Identity document fraud appears as a structured and interregional criminality, against which material and forensic links detected between false identity documents might serve as a tool for investigation...|$|R
