40|$|Thirty 20 {{year old}} <b>Bacon</b> avocado <b>trees</b> were topworked by bark-grafting {{to the more}} {{profitable}} Hass avocado cultivar in May of 1994. Nurse limbs of the Bacon cultivar were left {{on all of the}} trees to induce more scion growth. Nurse limbs were removed from half of the trees at random but left on {{the other half of the}} trees to observe any benefit by cross-pollination. The first Hass crop (1997) after topworking had significantly more fruit on the <b>trees</b> with <b>Bacon</b> nurse limbs. The sum of the three crop years had slightly greater fruit numbers for nurse limb-treated trees, how-ever this was not significant. The study demonstrated that cross-pollination of Hass avocado trees with nurse limbs of the Bacon avocado can significantly increase fruit numbers in some seasons. Climatic and alternate bearing effects may need to be studied, as well as increased tree size com-pared to nurse limb size as trees grow...|$|R

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, the Basel region {{has seen a}} {{proliferation}} of new museums addressing themes of art and design, especially concerning works from more recent years. The Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein presents {{a broad range of}} design topics, with a special emphasis on furniture and interior design. Though originally based on the private collection of chairs and other furniture assembled by Rolf Fehlbaum, the owner of the Vitra furniture company, the museum was established as an independent institution. The Vitra building complex has made notable contributions to the body of avant-garde architecture in the Basel region. In addition to the 1989 museum by Frank O. Gehry, the grounds feature structures by Zaha Hadid, Nicholas Grimshaw, Tadao Ando and Álvaro Siza. In 1982, the Beyeler Foundation assumed ownership of the art collection of Hildy and Ernst Beyeler, which the couple had built up over half a century. Since 1997, the works of classical modern art have been exhibited in a building designed by Renzo Piano in the town of Riehen. Featured artists include Degas, Monet, Cézanne, van Gogh, Picasso, Rothko, Warhol, Lichtenstein and <b>Bacon.</b> The <b>trees</b> in the park surrounding the highly acclaimed building were wrapped by Christo and Jeanne-Claude in 1998.|$|R
