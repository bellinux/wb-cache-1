5000|$|Historically, {{the most}} junior student <b>barristers</b> were only {{permitted}} to watch moot court trials and stood within {{the bar of}} the moot courtroom. More qualified <b>barristers</b> (known as [...] "outer" [...] or [...] "utter" [...] <b>barristers)</b> were permitted to join the argument and stood outside the bar.

50|$|The first {{association}} of <b>barristers</b> in Victoria {{was formed in}} 1884, although the first <b>barristers</b> admitted to practise in Victoria were appointed in 1841. A group of <b>barristers</b> composed rules of practice and regulations for interacting with solicitors and clients. On 20 June 1900 an official Bar Council was established, and a Bar Roll was started. By 1902, all <b>barristers</b> practising in Melbourne had signed the Roll. To this day, new <b>barristers</b> sign the Roll once they are admitted to the bar.|$|R
5|$|After an {{examination}} in May 1723, Murray was accepted into Christ Church, Oxford, having scored {{higher in the}} examination than any other King's Scholar that year. He was admitted as a commoner on 15 June 1723, and matriculated on 18 June; the records say that he came from Bath rather than Perth, because the person recording {{the names of the}} new students was unable to understand his Scottish accent. His older brother James was a <b>barrister</b> in Scotland, and his family decided that a career as a <b>barrister</b> was best for Murray. The Scottish Bar at the time was overcrowded, which made it difficult for a young <b>barrister</b> to build a reputation, yet qualifying for the English Bar was extremely expensive. Thanks to the patronage of Thomas Foley, 1st Baron Foley, who gave Murray £200 a year to live on, Murray could afford to study at the bar, and became a member of Lincoln's Inn on 23 April 1724.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} patterns of team formation amongst <b>barristers</b> who {{appeared before the}} UK Supreme Court between October 2009 and August 2015. We {{show that there is}} evidence of considerable gender homophily in the formation of teams of <b>barristers</b> appearing before the UK Supreme Court. Same-sex teams of <b>barristers</b> are over-represented compared to the number we would expect if <b>barristers</b> paired up randomly. We also show that this gender homophily remains when we allow for the possibility that <b>barristers</b> pair up randomly within their chambers, or within their area of law. As such, the formation of teams of <b>barristers</b> in the Supreme Court is governed by practices and preferences which make same-sex legal teams more likely than they would be if team formation simply involved a gender-blind draw from a pool of lawyers. <b>Barristers</b> appearing before the Supreme Court prefer, for whatever reason, to work with other <b>barristers</b> of the same sex. We set out reasons why homophily in team formation is undesirable and discuss the routes through which different remedies might operate...|$|R

40|$|The Legal Services Act 2007 {{caused a}} need to change {{professional}} conduct rules for lawyers in England and Wales. The Bar Standards Board Handbook brings substantial changes to the way <b>barristers</b> are regulated. Changes include litigation rights, reporting of professional misconduct, an increased focus on chambers, and expansion to include employees of chambers and <b>barristers</b> without practicing certificates (unregistered or non-practicing <b>barristers).</b> The approach to enforcement and supervision moves to include elements of outcome focused, principle based and risk based approaches. These changes {{have the potential to}} change the practice of different groups of <b>barristers</b> and the dynamics between them...|$|R
5000|$|Until 1885, all {{intending}} Irish <b>barristers</b> were {{obliged to}} [...] "keep terms" [...] {{in one of the}} English Inns of Court before being called to the Irish Bar and being entitled to practise as <b>barristers</b> in Ireland. Following on from these close historical links to the English Bar, for much of the nineteenth century it appeared that a system of barristers' chambers would develop in Ireland. Initially, the benchers of the King's Inns made plans to build chambers for Irish <b>barristers,</b> in the vicinity of Dublin's Henrietta Street. From about 1793, the benchers {{went so far as to}} decide to have chambers built, funded both by the King's Inns and by <b>barristers</b> who would lease building land from the benchers for their own chambers. Deposits were levied annually from new <b>barristers</b> and solicitors, and rules were even agreed by the benchers for the regulation of tenancies by Irish <b>barristers</b> in chambers. However, despite this levying of the profession, following practical objections raised by the architect James Gandon concerning the difficulty of building the main King's Inns building at the same time as private chambers, the barristers' chambers were never built, and the idea of chambers for Irish <b>barristers</b> has languished to the present day.|$|R
5|$|After leaving politics, Hastings {{returned}} to {{his work as a}} <b>barrister,</b> and eventually surpassed even his previous reputation and success as an advocate. His first major case after returning was representing F. A. Mitchell-Hedges, a noted professional explorer, in his libel action against London Express Newspapers, the owner of the Daily Express. The Daily Express had published two articles saying that he was a liar, and had planned out a bogus robbery to advertise a device known as the Monomark. The case opened on 9 February 1928 in front of Lord Hewart, with Hastings and Norman Birkett representing Mitchell-Hedges and William Jowitt and J.B. Melville representing London Express Newspapers. Despite the skills of both Hastings and Birkett, who later became a much-lauded <b>barrister</b> in his own right, Mitchell-Hedges lost his case and had his reputation destroyed as a result.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a <b>barrister</b> of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected <b>barrister.</b> Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hastings returned, {{he had decided}} to become a <b>barrister.</b> There were various {{problems}} with this aim: in particular, he had no money, and the training for barristers was extremely expensive. Despite this, he refused to consider a change of career, and joined the Middle Temple as a student on 4 November 1901. It is uncertain why he chose this particular Inn of Court (his uncle J. Comyns Carr, his only connection with the Bar, {{was a member of the}} Inner Temple), but the most likely explanation was that the Middle Temple was popular with Irish barristers, and Hastings was of Irish ancestry. The examinations required to become a <b>barrister</b> were not particularly difficult or expensive, but once a student passed all the exams he would be expected to pay the then-enormous sum of £100 when he was called to the Bar – £100 in 1901 would be worth approximately £ in 2015 – and Hastings was literally penniless.|$|E
