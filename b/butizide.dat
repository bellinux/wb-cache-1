50|$|As it {{stems from}} leucine, the {{occurrence}} of isovaleraldehyde {{is not limited to}} beer; the compound has found to be a flavor component in many different types of foods. It is described as having a malty flavor and has been found in such foods as beer, cheese, coffee, chicken, fish, chocolate, olive oil, and tea. The compound is used as a reactant in the synthesis of a number of compounds. Notably it is used to synthesize 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene, and is then converted to 2,3-dimethylbutane-2,3-diol and methyltert-butylketone, better known as pinacolone. Pinacolone itself is then used in synthesis for number of pesticides. Additionally, a range of pharmaceuticals, such as <b>butizide,</b> are synthesized from isovaleraldehyde and its corresponding acid.|$|E
40|$|A double-blind, randomized, balanced, {{placebo-controlled}} {{study was}} conducted to assess the hypotensive and metabolic effects of a fixed combination of 5 mg of <b>butizide</b> and 50 mg of potassium canrenoate in 20 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. This treatment significantly reduced both clinic and ambulatory blood pressure and was well tolerated. Hypokalemia developed in only one patient. There were no other clinically significant metabolic side effects. SCOPUS: NotDefined. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
