40|$|Bridge decks are {{commonly}} subjected to harsh environmental conditions that {{often lead to}} serious corrosion problems triggered by blisters under the hot mix asphalt <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>surfacing</b> and secretly evolving during weather exposure until damage is often detected too late. Blisters may form under both the waterproofing dense mastic asphalt layer or under the waterproofing membrane which is often applied as additional water protection under the mastic asphalt (MA). One of the main technical issues is the formation of blisters under the membrane and asphalt-covered concrete structures caused by a complex mechanism governed by bottom-up pressure and loss of adhesion. A linear viscoelastic finite-element model was developed to simulate time-dependent blister growth in a dense mastic asphalt layer under uniformly applied pressure with and without temperature and pressure fluctuation. A finite element model was developed using ABAQUS with linear viscoelastic properties and validated with a closed form solution from first-order shear-deformation theory for thick plates. In addition, the blister test was conducted on different samples of MA in the laboratory and digital image correlation measurement technique was used to capture the three-dimensional vertical deflection of the MA over time. It {{was found that the}} blister may grow continuously under repeated loading conditions over subsequent days. With respect to blistering under waterproofing membranes, mechanical elastic modeling and experimental investigations were performed for three different types of membranes under in-plane stress state. The orthotropic mechanical behavior of a polymer modified bitumen membrane (PBM) was determined from biaxial test data. Finally, blister tests by applying controlled pressure between orthotropic PBMs and concrete plates were performed for studying the elliptical adhesive blister propagation using digital 3 D image correlation. The energy calculated from elliptical blister propagation was found comparable to the adhesive fracture energy from standard peeling tests for similar types of PBMs. This indicates that the peeling test assists to evaluate and rank the adhesive properties of different types of membranes with respect to blister formation at room temperature without conducting time consuming and complicated pressurized blister propagation tests using digital 3 D image correlation.

40|$|We {{have carried}} out a {{preliminary}} evaluation of two approaches to low-cost sensing systems for monitoring ice and water on <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>surfaces.</b> These sensing systems {{are based on the}} measurement of impedance of the sensor in contact with or close proximity to ice, water or aqueous solutions of deicing chemicals.

While we originally expected that both measurements would be required to reliably determine the condition of a <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>surface</b> with regard to the presence of frozen water or deicing solutions, we have found that the TDR approach is adequate for this task.

40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of vortex induced vibrations (VIV) {{in the design}} of <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> is becoming more apparent (Wu and Kareem, 2012). Generally, experimental literature presents a <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> situated in a smooth flow, though bridges are usually subjected to the inherent turbulence of atmospheric wind. According to the results of Matsumoto et al. (1993), the effects of turbulence on VIV are rather complicated, this is mainly due to an interaction between the vortices in the wake, and vortices induced by the structure motion. The impacts of turbulence on the motion-induced forces are uncertain due to a limited understanding of this issue. Wu and Kareem (2012) also present a conjecture, suggesting that turbulence can enhance or diminish the structural response, depending on whether the dominant vortices are generated from the motion of the structure, or vortex shedding in the wake. This numerical investigation aims to verify this hypothesis, while studying the effects of turbulence on the structural response, aerodynamic forces, correlations, and wake characteristics for a dynamic <b>bridge</b> <b>deck.</b> Some effects of freestream turbulence on a rectangular <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> undergoing VIV are presented. Heaving motion of the model under a smooth flow is presenting with a peak r. m. s. response y/D∼ 3 % in a close agreement with the equivalent wind tunnel experiment. Introducing turbulence into the flow reduces the peak rms response by 50 %, which is in accordance with observations in the literature. This abstract also reports the effects of turbulence on the spanwise correlation of pressure on the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Due to the dominance of the structural motion, the correlations for the dynamic cases at lock-in were markedly increased in comparison to the equivalent static case. The presence of turbulence has also shown to reduce the correlation across the span for both static and dynamic cases. It can therefore be deduced that turbulence reduces the strength of the leading edge (motion-induced) vortices of the structure, and accordingly its VIV response. Sensitivity studies of the effects of turbulence intensity and integral length scales were conducted. Effects of turbulence on the pitching motion were studied as well. Detailed results will be reported in the conference...|$|R

Dynamic stress {{computation}} of long suspension bridges {{under both}} railway and wind loading {{is required for}} either strength or fatigue assessment. However, the effect of dynamic coupling among bridge, railway vehicle and wind on bridge stress response is not well understood. This paper presents a method for predicting bridge dynamic stress responses with coupling effects included.

The spatial distribution of both buffeting forces and self-excited forces over the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> <b>surface</b> is considered to facilitate the computation of local stress responses. The Tsing Ma suspension bridge in Hong Kong and the data recorded by a Wind and Structural Health Monitoring System (WASHMS) installed in the bridge are utilized as a case study to verify the proposed method to some extent. The railway loading and wind speed measured by the WASHMS are taken as input for the computation simulation. The computed local stress responses are compared with the measured ones. The results from the case study demonstrate that the proposed method could effectively predict the local stress responses of the coupled traffic vehicles and suspension bridge system in cross winds. ?

Statistical analysis of upstream and downstream in-stream samples showed that bridges did not impact the quality of the water body. Similar results were found from sediment samples as there was no definite increase in streambed sediment concentrations from downstream to upstream. The low amount of rain during the summer of 2012 with large antecedent dry periods (ADPs) between storms resulted in worse conditions for the bridge runoff samples. The concentrations of bridge runoff samples were difficult to compare to literature values because they were not measured as event mean concentrations (EMCs); however, none of the results exceeded EPA recommended values for surface water. Two runoff events were also used in a 48 -hour 5 dilution series toxicity test with fathead minnows, and no negative effects were found.

The developed data analysis algorithms allows the robot to build the entire <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> image and the global mapping of corrosion, delamination and elastic modulus of the <b>bridge</b> <b>decks.</b> These advanced data analysis algorithms take into account the advantages of the accurate robotic localization and navigation to provide the high-efficient assessments of the <b>bridge</b> <b>decks.</b>|$|R

The work consists of (1) a comprehensive literature review {{of the causes of}} cracking on <b>bridge</b> <b>decks,</b> (2) a review of previous <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> rehabilitation projects that experienced early-age cracking along with construction observations of active deck rehabilitation projects, and (3) an experimental evaluation of the two most commonly used <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> concrete mixtures. Based on the literature review, the causes of concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> cracking can be classified into three categories: concrete material properties, construction practices, and structural design factors. The most likely causes of the observed early-age cracking were found to be inadequate curing and failure to properly eliminate the risk of plastic shrinkage cracking. These results underscore the significance of proper moist curing methods for concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>decks,</b> including repair sections. This document also provides a blueprint for future researchers to investigate early-age cracking of concrete structures...|$|R
