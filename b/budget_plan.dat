This proposal included cutting the Department of Education by 83percent and the United States Department of Homeland Security by 43percent, as well as folding the Department of Energy into the Department of Defense and eliminating the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Seven independent agencies would be eliminated and food stamps would be cut by 30percent.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} current {{practice}} of capital <b>budget</b> <b>planning</b> and {{control in the}} Hong Kong (HK) construction industry, based on two surveys undertaken in 1994 and 1999. The aims of these surveys were to uncover the financial planning, monitoring and control procedures used by building engineering contractors in HK. The {{results of the current}} survey reveal that {{less than half of the}} respondents undertook any form of capital <b>budget</b> <b>planning.</b> The most common form of capital <b>budget</b> <b>planning</b> was a review of the minimum rate of return. Despite the low prevalence of planning, most respondents adopted some method of capital budget control, especially by way of monitoring project performance. The 1999 study was compared with a similar survey conducted in 1994. The results indicate that there was no significant improvement in capital <b>budget</b> <b>planning</b> practices over the five year period.

5|$|Ryan's budget plans {{proposed}} privatizing Medicare {{for those}} {{under the age}} of 55, and funding Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through block grants to the states. In 2012 Ryan proposed that Medicaid be converted into block grants, but with the federal government's share of the cost cut by some $800 billion over the next decade. Currently, Medicaid is administered by the states, subject to federal rules concerning eligibility, and the amount paid by the federal government depends on {{the number of people who}} qualify. His plan would have undone a Reagan-era reform by which the federal government prohibited the states from requiring that a patient's spouse, as well as the patient, deplete all of his or her assets before Medicaid would cover long-term care. Ryan’s <b>budget</b> <b>plan</b> proposed raising the Medicare eligibility age, beginning in 2023, by two months a year, until it reached 67 in 2034. A 2011 analysis, conducted by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research group, for the Kaiser Family Foundation, estimated that Ryan's 2011 plan would have resulted in 14 million to 27 million fewer people receiving Medicaid coverage by 2021.|$|E

25|$|Regardless of the S-program's design, Swedlund {{decided to}} get {{immediate}} approval for the L-program. In separate discussions between the Chief and defense minister Sven Andersson in Autumn 1958 regarding nuclear weapons and the <b>budget</b> <b>plan</b> for the coming financial years, Andersson {{made it clear that}} he favored the acquisition of nuclear weapons, but the split within the Social Democrats was so stark that it was better to not bring up the matter for discussion. Prime Minister Erlander's view was to study the question within the committee of the party and to come up with a proposition by the annual party congress in 1960. Andersson attempted to persuade the Chief to not request budgetary resources for the L-program, because they would likely be rejected. Despite Andersson’s suggestions, the Commander-in-Chief instead opted to include funds for L-program in his fiscal year 1959/1960 budget proposal. Swedlund’s diaries and other documents suggest that he had limited understanding of the political game, not least within the parties, even though his own statements in 1957 contributed to the creation of nuclear weapons resistance. He also believed that many of the senior politicians would be able to handle the issue as he desired. His lack of flexibility and belief that personal connections would overcome political opposition ultimately killed his funding request for L-program. While the L-program was left unfunded, FOA was given a large allocation for fiscal year 1959/1960 for “increased research in atomic-, missile-, countermeasure-, and other areas” in which the S-program was relevant.|$|E
