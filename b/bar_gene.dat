50|$|The marked {{difference}} {{between male and}} female chicks is due to gene dosage of the sex-linked <b>barring</b> <b>gene</b> ('barring' (B), 'nonbarring' (b+)). This gene is located on the Z-Chromosome of birds. Birds have different sex-chromosomes (Z and w) and a different sex-determination system compared to mammals (X and Y). Male birds have therefore two Z-chromosomes while female birds have a Z- and a dwarfed w-chromosome. This means that phenotypically barred roosters can either have the B/B or the B/b+ genotype, while a barred hen always has to have a B/- genotype. The colour-sexing of Legbar chicks, however, is only possible because the male chicks have a double dose of the sex-linked <b>barring</b> <b>gene</b> (genoype B/B), while the female chicks only have a single dose (genoype B/-), resulting in the observed down colours.|$|R

40|$|In two earlier papers 21 23 it was {{reported}} that when melanoblasts of the Barred Plymouth Rock embryo were grafted into an embryo of a non-barred breed such as the N. H. Red, Black Minorca, and White Leghorn, two definite types of black and white barred patterns were produced in the host contour feathers. The black bands were wider and darker in one type than in the other. These pigmentation differences appeared to be similar to sex-linked differences in barred pattern exhibited in control Barred Rock chicks of the same age. The suggestion was therefore made that the two patterns produced could be accounted for on the basis of sex-linked inheritance of the barring factor, the melanophores from the female donor which has only one <b>gene</b> for <b>barring</b> producing a darker and wider black band in host feather than one from a male donor which has two <b>genes</b> for <b>barring.</b> These preliminary results furnished the basis for the present study on the effects of the sex-linked <b>barring</b> <b>gene</b> upon the melanophores in their control of barred pattern.

40|$|Abstract Background Particle {{bombardment}} {{has been}} successfully employed for obtaining transgenics in cereals in general and wheat in particular. Most of these procedures employ immature embryos which are not available throughout the year. The present investigation utilizes mature seeds as the starting material and the calli raised from the hexaploid Triticum aestivum and tetraploid Triticum durum display a high regeneration response and were therefore used as the target tissue for genetic transformation by the biolistic approach. Results Mature embryo-derived calli of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, cv. CPAN 1676) and durum wheat (T. durum, cv. PDW 215) were double bombarded with 1. 1 gold microprojectiles coated with pDM 302 and pAct 1 -F at a target distance of 6 cm. Southern analysis using the <b>bar</b> <b>gene</b> as a probe revealed the integration of transgenes in the T 0 transformants. The <b>bar</b> <b>gene</b> was active in both T 0 and T 1 generations as evidenced by phosphinothricin leaf paint assay. Approximately 30 % and 33 % primary transformants of T. aestivum and T. durum, respectively, were fertile.

A single 2. 7 -kb α 1 BAR mRNA was detected in aorta and vena cava during normoxia and hypoxia. The α 1 BAR 5 ′ flanking region was sequenced to − 2, 460 (relative to ATG + 1). Transient transfection experiments identify the minimal promoter region between − 270 and − 143 and sequence between − 270 and − 248 that are required for transcription of the α 1 <b>BAR</b> <b>gene</b> in aorta and vena cava SMC during normoxia and hypoxia. An ATTAAA motif within this sequence specifically binds aorta, vena cava, and DDT 1 MF- 2 nuclear proteins, and transcription primarily initiates downstream of this motif at approximately − 160 in aorta SMC.

Six transgenic lines showed high percentages (67 - 80 %) of survival in vitro under the selection condition with glufosinate ammonium (up to 216 mg l(- 1)). Under greenhouse conditions, the plants from these six lines remained healthy and exhibited a normal phenotype after spraying with glufosinate ammonium (up to 1, 350 mg l(- 1)). This is the first paper to provide a detailed survey of transgenic lisianthus expressing the <b>bar</b> <b>gene</b> and exhibiting herbicide-resistance under greenhouse conditions...|$|E
40|$|Mannose-specific Allium sativum leaf {{agglutinin}} encoding gene (ASAL) and {{herbicide tolerance}} <b>gene</b> (<b>BAR)</b> were introduced into an elite cotton inbred line (NC- 601) employing Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. Cotton transformants were produced from the phosphinothricin (PPT) -resistant shoots obtained after co-cultivation of mature embryos with the Agrobacterium strain EHA 105 harbouring recombinant binary vector pCAMBIA 3300 -ASAL-BAR. PCR and Southern blot analysis confirmed {{the presence and}} stable integration of ASAL and <b>BAR</b> <b>genes</b> in various transformants of cotton. Basta leaf-dip assay, northern blot, western blot and ELISA analyses disclosed variable expression of BAR and ASAL transgenes in different transformants. Transgenes, ASAL and BAR, were stably inherited and showed co-segregation in T 1 generation in a Mendelian fashion for both PPT tolerance and insect resistance. In planta insect bioassays on T 2 and T 3 homozygous ASAL-transgenic lines revealed potent entomotoxic effects of ASAL on jassid and whitefly insects, as evidenced by significant decreases in the survival, development and fecundity of the insects {{when compared to the}} untransformed controls. Furthermore, the transgenic cotton lines conferred higher levels of resistance (1 – 2 score) with minimal plant damage against these major sucking pests when bioassays were carried out employing standard screening techniques. The developed transgenics could serve as a potential genetic resource in recombination breeding aimed at improving the pest resistance of cotton. This study represents the first report of its kind dealing with the development of transgenic cotto...|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} laser-mediated {{setup for}} introducing exogenous DNA (pAB 6 plasmid with GUS and <b>bar</b> <b>genes)</b> into cells of embryogenic calli of the Egyptian wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. Giza 164 was done. The new setup secures the transformation {{as high as}} 400, 000 embryo-derived cells in less than 35 min using a homemade UV excimer laser with two dimensional translation stages, a suitable computer program and a proper optical device. Immature embryos of wheat were grown for six days on TW medium. Osmotic treatment was done by using mannitol (0. 4 M) mixed with the exogenous DNA, in which laser treatment was immediately conducted. The calli were irradiated by a focused laser microbeam to puncture holes ~ 0. 5 µm in the cell wall and membrane to allow uptake of the exogenous DNA. Three regenerated putative transgenic events were evaluated for the presence and expression of both genes and results indicated that this modified procedure of laser-mediated transformation can be successfully used in transforming wheat with a very high efficiency...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} and largely genotype-independent transformation method for Brassica napus and Brassica oleracea was established based on neo or bar as selectable marker genes. Hypocotyl explants of Brassica napus and Brassica oleracea cultivars were infected with Agrobacterium strains containing chimeric neo and <b>bar</b> <b>genes.</b> The use of AgNO 3 was {{a prerequisite for}} efficient shoot regeneration under selective conditions. Vitrification was avoided by decreasing the water potential of the medium, by decreasing the relative humidity in the tissue culture vessel, and by lowering the cytokinin concentration. In this way, rooted transformed shoots were obtained with a 30 % efficiency in 9 to 12 weeks. Southern blottings and genetic analysis of S 1 -progeny showed that the transformants contained on average between one and three copies of the chimeric genes. A wide range of expression levels of the chimeric genes was observed among independent transformants. Up to 25 % of the transformants showed no detectable phosphinotricin acetyltransferase or neomycin phosphotransferase II enzyme activities although Southern blottings demonstrated that these plants were indeed transformed...|$|R
