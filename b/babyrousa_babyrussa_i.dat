50|$|Suidae is {{a family}} of {{artiodactyl}} mammals commonly called pigs, hogs, or boars. In addition to numerous fossil species, up to sixteen extant species are currently recognized, classified into between four and eight genera. The family includes the domestic pig, Sus scrofa domesticus or Sus domesticus, in addition to numerous species of wild pig, such as the babirusa <b>Babyrousa</b> <b>babyrussa</b> and the warthog Phacochoerus aethiopicus. All suids, or swine, are native to the Old World, ranging from Asia to Europe and Africa.|$|R
50|$|The Buru {{babirusa}} (<b>Babyrousa</b> <b>babyrussa),</b> {{also known}} as the Moluccan babirusa, golden babirusa or hairy babirusa, is a wild pig-like animal native to the island of Buru and the two Sula Islands of Mangole and Taliabu, all belonging to Indonesia. Traditionally, this relatively small species included the other babirusas as subspecies, but it has been recommended treating them as separate species based on differences in their morphology. As also suggested by its alternative common names, the Buru Babirusa has relatively long thick, gold-brown body-hair - a feature not shared by the other extant babirusas.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the gross anatomical structure of the stomach of the babirusa (<b>Babyrousa</b> <b>babyrussa)</b> differs markedly from that of all other pigs. This light and scanning electron microscopic study revealed a previously unknown, microscopic structure characterised by a 'honeycomb' pattern at the luminal surface of the tunica mucosa. The walls of the 'honeycomb' were about 0. 20 - 0. 25 mm high and appeared almost entirely composed of various types of bacteria. underneath the bacteria the walls were formed by thin tubes composed of non-glandular squamous epithelial-like cells, extending from the tops of the ridges between each glandular pit. There is as yet no evidence of a comparable structure in the stomach of any other pig, or to our knowledge any other forestomach-fermenting mammal...|$|R
25|$|As Buru {{is located}} at the {{boundary}} between the biogeographic zones of Australia and Asia, its flora and fauna are unique and are the subject of national and international scientific research. Of 25 species of mammals found on the island, at least four are endemic to Buru and closest to it islands. The local species of the wild pig named Buru babirusa (<b>Babyrousa</b> <b>babyrussa)</b> is distinguished from the other Babyrousa species by having relatively long and thick body-hair. It also has very low fat content in their meat (only 1.27% compared to 5–15% for domestic pigs) and is regarded as a delicacy among the local population, which favours it to other wild pigs or deer in terms of texture and flavour. Also endemic to Buru are three types of bats: Moluccan flying fox (Pteropus chrysoproctus), Ceram fruit bat Pteropus ocularis and lesser tube-nosed bat (Nyctimene minutus).|$|R
40|$|Stomachs {{from six}} adults and one 12 -month old {{babirusa}} (<b>Babyrousa</b> <b>babyrussa)</b> {{were collected from}} zoological gardens.

Microscopically, the structure of the cardiac, gastric and pyloric glands was similar to that of Sus scrofa. However, the muscus-producing cardiac glands of babirusa occupied a larger area within the stomach (> 70 % versus 33 %). The pH in the lumen of the cardiac gland area lay between 5. 3 and 6. 4 and micro-organisms were found here.

40|$|While {{working on}} the {{research}} and design phase of a naturalistic Asian rainforest exhibit for the California Science Center’s World of Ecology exhibit, we had the unique opportunity to research and develop innovative habitat components intended to showcase naturalistic behaviors. In many cases, the cost of designing and constructing truly naturalistic enrichment devices may not be worthwhile, particularly when it is uncertain how target taxa may respond. We were tasked {{with the challenge of}} designing, constructing, testing, and assessing naturalistic enrichment prototypes for siamangs (Hylobates syndactylus), babirusa (<b>Babyrousa</b> <b>babyrussa),</b> crocodile monitors (Varanus salvadorii), and Komodo dragons (Varanus komodoensis). Design objectives included: 1) striking a balance between ensuring sound husbandry while maintaining the natural appearance of the exhibit; 2) providing animals the opportunity and motivation to express species-typical behaviors; and 3) exploring enrichment options {{within the context of the}} natural exhibit design. Data were collected by observing animals that were well habituated to their enclosures. Analysis of the data provided valuable design insight and suggested that modifications range from none to some changes necessary to fully achieve design objectives...|$|R
40|$|The {{babirusa}} is {{a remarkable}} pig, endemic on the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi, Buru and the smaller Sula and Togian islands. The single species of the genus is divisable into three living subspecies: <b>Babyrousa</b> <b>babyrussa</b> babyrussa (Sula Islands and Buru), B. b. togeanensis (Togian islands) and B. b. celebenesis (Sulawesi) (Groves, 1980), of which only the latter is currently represented in captivity. The species is listed in the IUCN Red Data Book as vulnerable and {{can be considered a}} marker animal for the disturbance of the primary rainforest. The Indonesian Department of Forest Protection and nature Conservation (Perlindungan Hutan dan Pelestarian Alam: PHPA) has given it the second most important priority after the Indonesian rhinos. This present paper reports the results of studies carried out on a large number of babirussa. Observations were made in Antwerp Zoo in Belgium and in the Zoos at Surabaya and Jakarta in Indonesia. These institutions represent 3 different ways in which the babirusa are currently kept in captivity. In Antwerp Zoo, each animal has its own enclosure; Surabaya Zoo keeps animals in large groups and Jakarta Zoo houses them in pairs. Each of these different housing techniques had its own implications on the behaviour shown by the animals and this allowed us to make suggestions for their future husbandry...|$|R
40|$|The {{babirusa}} (<b>Babyrousa</b> <b>babyrussa)</b> {{is believed}} to be the most distinct pig genus in the world. For example, among a number of unique anatomical characteristics, it is the only mammal with vertically growing canine teeth. Endemic to Sulawesi, and found on a few neighbouring islands such as Buru, Mangole, Taliabu and the Togian islands, the babirusa has a very limited geographical distribution. The available evidence seems to indicate that this is because Sulawesi has long been isolated by water from mainland Asia; the strait between Sulawesi and Borneo was apparently never narrower than about 50 kilometres during Pleistocene times. The current hypothesis is that the Babyrousa developed along a separate evolutionary line since Oligocene times (Thenius, 1970). This concept is supported by analyses of chromosome banding patterns that indicate that the chromosomes of the babirusa differed from those of other wild pigs (see Bosma et al, 1991). However, more recent work using DNA probes have shown that there are closer similarities between the chromosomes of Sus and Babyrousa than previously thought (Thomsen et al, 1996). DNA studies are beginning to reveal detailed molecular information with regard to the nature of the relationships babirusa has with other extant pig species (Randi et al, 1995; Lowden et al, 2002). New genetic analyses can be expected to give a much better understanding of the origin of the babirusa...|$|R
50|$|The Bola Batu {{babirusa}} (Babyrousa bolabatuensis) is {{a proposed}} species of babirusa from the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It was first described in 1950 as a subspecies of <b>Babyrousa</b> <b>babyrussa,</b> then the only recognized species of babirusa, and raised to species rank by Colin Groves and Erik Meijaard in 2002. At present the Bola Batu babirusa is only known for certain from subfossil remains {{from the southern}} arm of Sulawesi. Based on a single skull from central Sulawesi {{it has been suggested}} that babirusas from this part of Sulawesi represent an extant population of the Bola Batu babirusa, and this was followed in the third edition of Mammal Species of the World. However, the most recent major review also found similarities between the central Sulawesi specimen and the Togian babirusa, leading them to conclude that it represents an undescribed taxon and that the taxonomic position of central Sulawesi babirusas only can be determined through additional specimens. Subfossil remains from the south-western arm of Sulawesi, where now likely extinct, have been classified as Bola Batu babirusas, but these were considered unclassifiable in 2002, as were extant populations from the eastern arm of Sulawesi and Buton due to the lack of specimens. Due to these uncertainties, the IUCN Red List provisionally synonymized B. bolabatuensis under the northern Sulawesi species, B. celebensis, pending clarification of the taxonomy of Sulawesi babirusas.|$|R
40|$|Among the artiodactyla, the suids are a {{group whose}} {{digestive}} physiology has hardly been investigated. The apparent digestibilities (aD) of macronutrients were measured in captive specimens of warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), and Visayan warty pigs (Sus cebifrons), and {{compared with those}} reported for babirusa (<b>Babyrousa</b> <b>babyrussa)</b> from the same facility on a similar diet. The animals were fed mixed diets of pelleted feed, grains, fruits, and vegetables; dietary neutral detergent fiber (NDF) ranged from 17 to 26 % dry matter. aD of organic matter and protein ranged from 72 to 89 and 70 to 82 %, respectively. Although red river hogs and warty pigs achieved aD of NDF of 41 - 54 %, this value was higher both in warthogs (63 - 66 %) and babirusa (61 - 63 %). aD of acid detergent fiber was comparatively low in red river hogs (4 %), warty pigs (22 %), and babirusa (13 - 25 %) but high in warthog (59 - 62 %). Comparison with additional literature data (including peccaries) indicates {{that in spite of}} differences in digestive anatomy, suids and peccaries are similar, and resemble other herbivores in fundamental characteristics, such as the negative influence of fiber on overall digestibility, or the positive influence of dietary protein on protein digestion. Although the existing data are equivocal as to a superior fiber digestion in peccaries as compared with other wild suids, the results suggest that warthogs are more efficient than other wild suids or peccaries in terms of fiber digestion...|$|R
40|$|In {{connection}} with a study of an extensive collection of prehistoric mammals from Toalian caves in Southwestern Celebes, {{a certain number of}} recent mammal species from Celebes and adjacent islands have been examined. In most cases the recent material for comparison available of a given species was adequate to determine the status of the corresponding cave form. Some of the cave animals (Phalanger celebensis (Gray), Macaca maura (Geoffr. et F. Cuvier), Macrogalidia musschenbroekii (Schlegel), Sus celebensis Müller et Schlegel, and <b>Babyrousa</b> <b>babyrussa</b> (L.)) could be shown to be subspecifically distinct from the living forms (Hooijer, 1950 a). In all of these cases the time that has elapsed since the deposition of the material in the prehistoric caves has been sufficient for a subspecific differentiation to have taken place. In some cases examined, however, the recent material available to me at the time was rather poor, and additional material was greatly needed. Since the preparation of the cave report (Hooijer, 1950 a) more recent specimens have been examined while visiting various natural history museums in the United States. It is a great pleasure to thank the curators of mammals, Dr. George H. H. Tate of the American Museum of Natural History, Dr. David H. Johnson of the United States National Museum, and Dr. Colin C. Sanborn of the Chicago Natural History Museum, for their kind cooperation and permission to study the material in the collections under their charge.

40|$|The fossil {{elephant}} remains {{recently discovered}} in S. Celebes by Mr. H. R. van Heekeren, and entrusted {{to me by}} Prof. Dr. A. J. Bernet Kempers, Head of the Archaeological Survey of the Dutch East Indies, belong to a small form of the genus Archidiskodon. These specimens, described and figured in the present paper, give the first evidence {{of the existence of}} Proboscidea in the island of Celebes. As stated already in earlier notes on the fossils in Mr. Van Heekeren's collection (Hooijer, 1948 a, 1948 b, 1948 c) this elephant is associated with a fauna containing a peculiar suid (Celebochoerus heekereni Hooijer), a babirusa (<b>Babyrousa</b> <b>babyrussa</b> beruensis Hooijer), an anoa (Anoa depressicornis (Smith) subsp.), and a gigantic land-tortoise (Testudo margae Hooijer). None of the fossils has been found in situ, but one of the elephant molars was still embedded in the matrix, a note on which is given below because it may help to determine the exact stratigraphical position of the specimen when the geology of the site will have been studied. The matrix of the unworn right M 2 or M 3 from Sompoh near Tjabengè (Sopeng district), about 100 km N. E. of Macassar was kindly studied by Mr. L. J. Fick and is a river-laid sediment with volcanic material. The rock consists of detrital grains of lateritic sandstone, the interstices partly filled with amorphous limonitic silica and opaque components. There are some pieces of quartz and veins of rhombohedral calcite. The volcanic components consist for the greater part of diopside and a few crystals of alkaline felspar.

40|$|SUMMARY Skins and skulls of <b>Babyrousa</b> <b>babyrussa</b> {{have been}} studied; {{the species is}} {{divisible}} into three living subspecies : B. b. babyrussa (syn. frosti) from Buru and Sula, B. b. togeanensis from Malenge, and B. b. celebensis from the northern arm of Celebes. A skull from near Kulawi, central Celebes, tends towards babyrussa, and may represent a surviving population of the inadequately characterised B. b. bolabatuensis, known as a subfossil from the southern arm of Celebes. Teeth of the latter form decreased in size through time. The possibility of the species having been introduced into Buru and Sula is discussed. INTRODUCTION The remarkable babirusa (genus Babirousa Perry, 1811) attracted early notice in western scientific circles, despite its restricted distribution (see Mohr, 1958 for a brief pre-Linnaean history). It commanded attention because of the bizarre appearance of the male, not only for Europeans but also, perhaps, for Indonesians (see below). Modern zoology has confirmed that it is indeed no "ordinary pig", {{as shown by the}} anatomical study of Davis (1940) : alone among the Suidae it retains four terminal tendons to M. plantaris; the arrangement of tendons to M. extensor digitorum communis resembles the peccaries; M. coracobrachialis has two heads, as is usual in ruminants; the stomach is complex, and the origin of M. omohyoideus again resembles the peccaries (Saban, 1968). While Deninger's (1909) claim that it had descended from a Miocene anthracothere can surely no longer be maintained, Thenius (1970) could see no common ancestor with the other Suidae more recent than the Oligocene, justifying its allocation to a separate subfamily, Babyrousinae.

40|$|Members of {{the family}} Suidae have diverged over {{extended}} evolutionary periods in diverse environments, suggesting that adaptation in response to endemic infectious agents may have occurred. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) comprise a multigene family that acts as {{the first line of}} defense against infectious microbes at the host-environment interface. We hypothesized that across the Suidae, positive selection mediated by infectious agents has contributed to the evolution of TLR diversity. Thus, we analyzed Sus scrofa, Sus barbatus, Sus verrucosus, Sus celebensis, Sus scebifrons, <b>Babyrousa</b> <b>babyrussa,</b> Potamochoerus larvatus, Potamochoerus porcus and Phacochoerus africanus genomes. Specifically, analyses were performed to identify evidence of positive selection using Maximum likelihood (ML) methods within a phylogenetic framework for bacterial and viral sensing Suidae TLR extracellular domains. Our analyses did not reveal evidence of positive selection for TLR 3 and TLR 7, suggesting strong functional conservation among these two genes for members of the Suidae. Positive selection was inferred for Suidae TLR 1, TLR 2, TLR 6 and TLR 8 evolution. ML methods identified amino acid sites of the bacterial sensing TLR 1, TLR 2, TLR 6 and the viral sensing TLR 8 to be under persistent positive selection. Some of these sites are in close proximity to functionally relevant sites, further strengthening the case for pathogen mediated selection for these sites. The branch leading to the genus Sus demonstrated evidence of episodic positive selection for TLR 1, indicating selection mediated by infectious agents encountered within the specific geographic origin of the Sus. These results indicate that species of the Suidae have positively selected residues within functional domains of TLRs reflective of prior infections. Thus, TLR genes represent candidates for experimental validation to determine their functional role in antibacterial and antiviral activity within members of the Suida...|$|R
40|$|The genus Celebochoerus {{was based}} by me (Hooijer, 1948) on two {{fragments}} of upper canines of rather large size, {{different from their}} homologues in Sus celebensis Müller and <b>Babyrousa</b> <b>babyrussa</b> (L.), the two living species of Suidae of Celebes. The specimens originate from Pleistocene deposits at Desa Beru, Tjabenge (Sopeng district), about 100 km N. E. of Macassar, S. Celebes, and were collected by Mr. H. R. van Heekeren, prehistorian to the Archaeological Survey at Macassar. In the meantime I have received more specimens of upper canines, collected by Mr. Van Heekeren at Desa Beru and also at Sompoh, 12 km N. of Beru. These specimens, like those first described, are surface finds and consequently more or less water-worn. They show {{a great deal of}} variation in size {{as well as in the}} shape of their cross-section. As time fails now to give a description of all the fragments, I shall describe the best specimens first. The largest specimen is the greater part of a right upper C, 11 cm in length. It originates from Sompoh. At the proximal end (pl. I fig. 3, to the right) the apex of the pulp cavity is shown. The tooth is slightly curved upward and backward and tapers distally. The cross-section is similar to that in the first described specimens (Hooijer, 1948, fig. 1 a, b) : the anterior surface is at right angles to the upper and both surfaces possess a shallow longitudinal groove. The posterior upper and lower angles are gradually rounded off, and there is a sharp groove in the lower half posteriorly. The greatest diameters are ca. 42 mm horizontally and ca. 39 mm vertically.

40|$|Background: The Toll-like {{receptor}} (TLR) {{signaling pathway}} constitutes {{an essential component}} of the innate immune system. Highly conserved proteins, indicative of their critical roles in host survival, characterize this pathway. Selective constraints could vary depending on the gene's position within the pathway as TLR signaling is a sequential process and that genes downstream of the TLRs may be more selectively constrained to ensure efficient immune responses given the important role of downstream genes in the signaling process. Thus, we investigated whether gene position influenced protein evolution in the TLR signaling pathway of the Suidae. The members of the Suidae examined included the European Sus scrofa (wild boar), Asian Sus scrofa (wild boar), Sus verrucosus, Sus celebensis, Sus scebifrons, Sus barbatus, <b>Babyrousa</b> <b>babyrussa,</b> Potamochoerus larvatus, Potamochoerus porcus and Phacochoerus africanus. Results: A total of 33 TLR signaling pathway genes in the Suidae were retrieved from resequencing data. The evolutionary parameter ω (dn/ds) had an overall mean of 0. 1668 across genes, indicating high functional conservation within the TLR signaling pathway. A significant relationship was inferred for the network parameters gene position, number of protein-protein interactions, protein length and the evolutionary parameter dn (nonsynonymous substitutions) such that downstream genes had lower nonsynonymous substitution rates, more interactors and shorter protein length than upstream genes. Gene position was significantly correlated with the number of protein-protein interactions and protein length. Thus, the polarity in the selective constraint along the TLR signaling pathway was due to the number of molecules a protein interacted with and the protein's length. Conclusion: Results indicate that the level of selective constraints on genes within the TLR signaling pathway of the Suidae is dependent on the gene's position and network parameters. In particular, downstream genes evolve more slowly as a result of being highly connected and having shorter protein lengths. These findings highlight the critical role of gene network parameters in gene evolution. </p...|$|R
