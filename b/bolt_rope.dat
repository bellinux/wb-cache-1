By this time the boat {{was close to the}} broken water. As the sail filled her head payed off towards it. The wind lay her right over, and before she could gather way there was a tremendous crash. The Susan had struck on the sands. The next wave lifted her, but as it passed on she came down with a crash that seemed to shake her in pieces.

50|$|Its {{similarity}} with a spinnaker {{is that it}} is not {{attached to}} a stay along its luff, and typically has a slightly larger curvature than a genoa. Luff shape and tension is maintained by the halyard and a <b>bolt</b> <b>rope</b> which is woven into the sail itself, and it is this stiff tensioned rope which allows the sail to be furled on itself. In addition, many screachers are gybed by allowing the sail to fly free and pass in front of the <b>bolt</b> <b>rope</b> and invert, much in the same way that an asymmetrical spinnaker is gybed. Tacking with a screacher may require furling and re-setting. The similarity with a genoa {{is that it is}} typically a white sail, and the clews always overlap the mast.|$|E

5000|$|Fore-and-aft sails {{often have}} <b>bolt</b> <b>ropes</b> {{on the leading}} edge (luff) where they attach to the mast and the bottom edge (foot) where they attach to the boom, which provide the terms, [...] "luff bolt rope" [...] and [...] "foot bolt rope".

In 1852 Lyman Hollingsworth purchased an existing paper mill {{on the site of}} the present West Groton Mill of Hollingsworth & Vose Company. Until 1881 it was used to manufacture paper from jute and manila for tag paper, pattern paper, abrasive backing, and wrapping paper. These products were sold both domestically and abroad.|$|R
50|$|The buntlines {{are small}} lines {{fastened}} {{to the bottom of}} the sails, in the middle part of the <b>bolt</b> <b>rope,</b> to the cringle; and so are passed through a small block, seized to the yard. Their use is to trice up the bunt of the sail, to better furl it up.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>bolt</b> <b>rope</b> (Variants: [...] "bolt-rope" [...] and [...] "boltrope", French: ralingue, Spanish: ralinga, Old Norse: *rár-línk, {{comprising}} rár genitive of rá [...] "rope" [...] and línk [...] "edge of a sail [...] "), is {{the rope}} that is sewn {{at the edges}} of the sail to reinforce them, or to fix the sail into a groove in the boom or in the mast.|$|E

5000|$|In mountaineering, a fixed rope or {{fixed line}} is the {{practice}} of fixing in place <b>bolted</b> <b>ropes</b> to assist climbers and walkers in exposed mountain locations.

Many guided expeditions {{to any of the}} eight-thousanders normally set up fixed rope on steep or icy sections of the route. For example, on the Hillary Step of Mount Everest, fixed rope was used to reduce the bottleneck of climbers that typically results from climbing this technical section just below the summit.|$|R

The Paramatta was still lying nearly over on her beam ends, but {{gradually}} her head began to pay off, and she slowly righted. A minute later she was tearing directly before the gale.

5000|$|Bolt ropes were {{described}} as early as 1847, when Robert Kipping addressed [...] "bolt-rope" [...] attachment {{for a variety of}} sails, using sewing techniques appropriate to each, in his book, The Elements of Sailmaking. He addressed the tradeoff between stiffness and flexibility to provide reinforcement without distorting the intended shape of the sail. He emphasized the need for the <b>bolt</b> <b>rope</b> not to affect the degree of slack on the leech (trailing edge) of a sail. He further emphasized that the rope must retain its original twist, as it is sewn in place, to avoid distorting the edge of the sail. He observed that, [...] "Many a well-cut sail is spoiled by the roping." ...|$|E
50|$|Sails feature {{reinforcements}} {{of fabric}} layers where lines attach at grommets or cringles. A <b>bolt</b> <b>rope</b> may be sewn onto {{the edges of}} a sail to reinforce it, or to fix the sail into a groove in the boom, in the mast, or in the luff foil of a roller-furling jib. They may have stiffening features, called battens, that help shape the sail, when full length, or just the roach, when present. They may {{have a variety of}} means of reefing them (reducing sail area), including rows of short lines affixed to the sail to wrap up unused sail, as on square and gaff rigs, or simply grommets through which a line or a hook may pass, as on Bermuda mainsails. Fore-and-aft sails may have tell-tales—pieces of yarn, thread or tape that are affixed to sails—to help visualize airflow over their surfaces.|$|E

[...] With great rapidity the sails of the fleet came down, and in five minutes its whole aspect was changed; but quickly as the sailors had done their work, the storm was even more rapid in its progress. Some of the ships whose crews were slower or less skilful than the others, were caught by the gale before they could get their sails snug, and the great sheets of white canvas were blown from the <b>bolt</b> <b>ropes</b> as if made of paper, and a blackness which could almost be felt, covered the sea, the only light being that given by the frothing waters. There was no longer any thought of order. Each ship had to shift for herself; and each captain to do his best to save those under his charge, without thought of what might befall the others.|$|R

40|$|Many {{unstable}} slopes exist about 1000 slope failures {{each year}} {{have occurred in}} Japan. An about 90 % of the failed slope is natural slope having the tree vegetation and the failure occurred in the surface ground within 3 meters in depth. The slope failure is mainly caused from the heavy rain and small earthquake. While the failures have to be prevented, the natural environment such as trees and vegetations on the slope has to be also maintained. Therefore, the retaining structure and the shotcrete, which have to cut {{the trees on the}} slope, are not suitable {{from the point of view}} of the conservation of natural state. From this point, the rock <b>bolt</b> and <b>rope</b> net method is developed to protect the slope failure with the nature conservation. The purpose of this research is to understand the mechanism of the reinforcement effect of rock bolt setting of the method. The shear test by the model 1 / 10 scale is conducted. As a result, it is clarified that the rock bolt setting has a large effect on the slope behavior.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} the protection method {{and the natural}} maintenance of aging shotcrete. In Japan, in the high economic growth period in 1960 ’s, {{a great number of}} slopes were formed to construct many roads and most slope protection methods were to cover shotcrete on the slope. In recent years, with concerns about the environmental and landscape, the construction of shotcrete is decreasing. However, even now about 7, 000, 000 ㎡of shotcrete is laid every year, and it is predicted that the total amount of shotcrete is enormous. Now, about 60 years passes after a great number of shotcrete was laid, and shotcrete have been aging. Therefore, we suggested the method which construct for directly aging shotcrete in the protection method and the greening protection method is considering cost and risk with new construction. We adopt the protection method by rock <b>bolt</b> and <b>rope</b> net. In this study, at first, we establish the vegetation base suitable for growth of plants which can be use together with the protection method. And then, we install many kind of the vegetation base that gave the vegetation on a model shotcrete. Finally, we compared the rates of water retention and vegetation growth.

(13 pp.) Pump operation was also followed closely during testing procedures and at least three problem areas associated with the discharge of cooling waters were found to exist. Interviews of both sea urchin and abalone fishermen working the coastal waters near the plant site were conducted. Activity of urchin fishermen has been fluctuating due to varying gonadal conditions of the urchins. Numbers of sea otters in the Point Buchon to Diablo Cove area have continued to diminish from the numbers observed in spring 1974. However, evidence of foraging, in the form of broken urchin tests, is very strong in Diablo Cove.

5000|$|Skepticism toward Maestri's 1959 account mounted as {{it became}} evident how {{difficult}} the alleged route is even with the advances in technique made through {{the first decade of}} the next century. Among the doubters are many well-known alpinists including Carlo Mauri, who had failed to climb the mountain in 1958 and in 1970, Reinhold Messner, and Ermanno Salvaterra, who had defended Maestri until successfully completing roughly the same route himself in 2005. The criticism was also taken up by British climber and writer Ken Wilson, editor of Mountain magazine. Besides citing the impossibility of the climb given the ice-climbing tools available in those years, the critics point out that Maestri's description of his route is detailed and accurate up to a glacier substantially lower than where Cesarino Fava claimed to have turned back, but vague and impossible to trace on the mountain thereafter; and that <b>bolts,</b> pitons, fixed <b>ropes</b> and other equipment used by the 1959 expedition is plentiful up to that glacier, but absent thereafter. [...] Nevertheless, Maestri has consistently maintained his version of events, as did Fava, who died in April 2008.|$|R
25|$|Wallach and Eastwood flew to Madrid {{together}} and between shooting scenes, Eastwood would relax and practice his golf swing. Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally drank {{from a bottle}} of acid that a film technician had set next to his soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring {{the safety of his}} actors during dangerous scenes. For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed to <b>bolt.</b> While the <b>rope</b> around Wallach's neck was severed, the horse was frightened a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted and his hands bound behind his back. The third time Wallach's life was threatened was during the scene where he and Mario Brega—who are chained together—jump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach's life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) henchman. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one foot out of every box car. If Wallach had stood up from his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.|$|R
30|$|The shear {{strength}} of a bolted timber joint is governed by {{the combination of the}} joint configuration, wood species, type of bolt, and joint geometry, which includes the thickness of the members and the end and edge distances. The embedding strength of the wood, yield moment of the bolt, and thickness of the members {{have an effect on the}} yield and ultimate strengths of bolted joints, and the end and edge distances often affect the ultimate strength and ductility. The {{shear strength}} of a bolted timber joint must be appropriately calculated during the design. At present, the yield theory developed by Johansen [57] is widely used for calculating the yield strengths of bolted joints in some design codes [2]. This theory is based on the assumption that the embedding of wood and bending of bolts have stiff-plastic behaviors. Some studies have been performed to compare the yield strengths of bolted joints calculated by the yield theory with experimental results, and its compatibility has been confirmed [2, 16, 26, 58 – 61]. Johansen proposed formulae for the shear strengths of single and double shear joints with wood side members. In addition, formulae corresponding to single and double shear joints with steel plates are adopted in some design codes. However, dowel-type joints that are not described in the codes are often adopted for actual timber joints. In recent years, formulae to estimate the shear strengths of dowel-type joints with an interlayer [62] and dowel-type joints with multiple slotted-in steel plates [39, 63] have been derived from Johansen’s yield theory. In addition, an alternate method to calculate the shear strengths of bolted joints without using the yield theory was proposed. This calculation was based on a beam on an elastic foundation, and the initial stiffness, load at the proportional limit, yield load, and ultimate load were estimated by considering the yield conditions of the wood and <b>bolt</b> and the <b>rope</b> effect [64].|$|R
40|$|Within a {{first floor}} {{room of a}} factory housed in the Gangadhar Ji Ki Haveli in the Naya bazaar of Ajmer, India, a loom is {{restrained}} by a <b>rope</b> <b>bolted</b> through the centre of a fictive scene painted on the wall to keep the machine in position. The painting {{has been identified as}} depicting the “celebration of the ninth or tenth day of Dasahra in Jaipur” and shows a “puja to the royal vehicles of war [...] elephants, horses, camels, carts, palanquins, etc”. The paintings are in a Jaipuri tradition, either early 19 th or possibly late 18 th century. The puncture appears to be sensitively positioned, through a blank middle ground of white. We were told at the factory that their products; “all kinds of Gota Fancy Jari and Metallic Goods” are mainly sold to the many thousands of pilgrims visiting the Dargah at Ajmer annually. Should the relationship between the painted scene and the mercantile activity supported by ongoing ritual traditions be regarded as a poignant overlayering or a serious conservation risk? A ruinous neighbouring site shows the economic threats at hand. Arguably the makeshift canopy over the inner courtyard, erected to facilitate the storage of materials has saved this building from obsolescence. The presence of the machines may even be seen in a positive light; ensuring that the frescoes are not overly impacted by high levels of humidity from modern domestic activity. The pigments are protected from natural light by permanent shades. In addition, its connection with the weaving, the ritual traditions of dress and occasion that surround the Dargah, make a literal thread from past to present, albeit transformed into “Rayon, Nylon and Metallic Yarn”. Nevertheless outside, the indifference appears more concerning, the elephants flanking the entrance are already half rendered in cement. On the face of it, it might be assumed that conservation management must begin and activity be suspended. However, it may also be read as a demonstration of specific path of continuity, an economic business model upheld by the ritual significance and almost unique cosmopolitan spiritual activity of the city itself...|$|R
