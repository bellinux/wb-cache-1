50|$|While {{the light}} blue paint <b>blazes</b> are usually {{vertical}} rectangles painted on trees {{to mark the}} trail, {{there is often a}} bit of variety in terms of both paint <b>blazes</b> and signage found on a Blue-Blazed Hiking Trail. Usually direction is indicated with one <b>blaze</b> to indicate 'go straight ahead', two <b>blazes</b> with the top <b>blaze</b> to the left indicating a left turn, two <b>blazes</b> with the top <b>blaze</b> to the right indicating a right turn, and two <b>blazes</b> directly {{on top of each other}} indicating the end of a trail (two parallel horizontal rectangles is the new preferred form). Three <b>blazes</b> indicates that the trail is forking in two different directions (as in a loop). But directional arrows are also often painted on rocks, trees and other stationary objects, particularly when they can provide better information (such as 'Up!' on a rock climb). Occasionally sticks or poles places in the ground are used instead of trees (especially in open fields) with a blue <b>blaze</b> or the top painted blue. Blue <b>blazes</b> are painted on telephone poles, road guard rails, buildings (rarely) and other signs (rarely). Sometimes wooden tags or wooden arrows are nailed to trees (or sticks stuck in the ground) though this is much more common on non-Blue-Blazed trails. Some trail sections are marked using blue plastic diamond signs or metallic disks nailed in trees rather than painted <b>blazes.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1936, A 121-day Maine to Georgia veteran's group {{funded and}} {{supported}} thru-hike {{was reported to}} have been completed, with all but three miles of the new trail cleared and <b>blazed,</b> by six Boy Scouts from New York City and their guides. The completed thru-hike was much later recorded and accepted by the Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Association.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving office}} as Indian Affairs Superintendent, Palmer worked his farm on his land claim and {{operated}} his sawmill {{and several other}} enterprises. Between 1858 and 1861 he spent time in British Columbia as a merchant to prospectors in the gold rushes of the Thompson River, Similkameen Valley, and Fraser River. Palmer <b>blazed</b> a route to the gold fields of the Okanogan Valley and the upper portions of the Columbia River from Priest Rapids in 1860. In 1862, {{he was elected to}} the Oregon House of Representatives to represent Yamhill County. Now a member of the Republican Party, he was named Speaker of the House during that session.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing the}} {{connection}} to the Lincoln Highway, officials convinced planners of the Victory Highway to traverse the state. The highway entered Colorado from Kansas along what was previously called the Smoky Hill Trail. The highway crossed the mountains along a trail <b>blazed</b> by a railroad surveyor and captain in the American Civil War, cresting at Berthoud Pass. After a round of political infighting between Utah and Nevada, the Victory Highway would become the Lincoln Highway's main rival for San Francisco-bound traffic. When the U.S. Highway system was unveiled in 1926, the Victory Highway was numbered U.S. Highway 40.|$|E

5|$|Seemingly {{restored}} to full health, Bradman <b>blazed</b> two centuries {{in the last}} two games of the tour. However, when he returned to London to prepare for the trip home, he experienced severe abdominal pain. It took a doctor more than 24hours to diagnose acute appendicitis and a surgeon operated immediately. Bradman lost a lot of blood during the four-hour procedure and peritonitis set in. Penicillin and sulphonamides were still experimental treatments at this time; peritonitis was usually a fatal condition. On 25 September, the hospital issued a statement that Bradman was struggling for his life and that blood donors were needed urgently.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) {{established}} ten {{camps in}} Moshannon State Forest, and ten in Elk State Forest. The {{young men of}} the CCC planted trees, <b>blazed</b> new trails, built roads and bridges, and fought fires, which {{continued to be a}} problem. In 1938 a fast-moving fire in the Elk State Forest, north of Quehanna, killed eight firefighters. The CCC also built structures and established or improved many of the state parks, including Parker Dam and S. B. Elliott State Parks on the western Quehanna plateau. The United States' entry into World War II ended the CCC, and all its camps were closed by the summer of 1942. The Quehanna Trail System passes near or through the sites of several former CCC camps.|$|E

5|$|US40Alternate {{is the old}} {{alignment}} of US40. The highway's path was <b>blazed</b> in the mid-18th century to connect the Hagerstown Valley and Shenandoah Valley with eastern Pennsylvania and central Maryland. In the early 19th century, US40Alternate's path was improved {{as part of a}} series of turnpikes to connect Baltimore with the eastern terminus of the National Road in Cumberland. The highway was improved as one of the original state roads in the early 1910s and designated US40 in the late 1920s. Construction on a relocated US40 between Hagerstown and Frederick with improved crossings of South Mountain and Braddock Mountain began in the mid-1930s; the new highway was completed in the late 1940s. US40 Alternate was assigned to the old route of US40 in the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Both German ships {{initially}} concentrated {{their fire}} on Hood and destroyed her with salvoes of 8- and 15-inch shells. An 8-inch shell hit the boat deck and struck a ready service locker for the UP rocket projectors, and a fire <b>blazed</b> {{high above the}} first superstructure deck. At 05:58 at a range of , the force commander ordered a turn of 20 degrees to port to open the range and bring the full battery of the British ships to bear on Bismarck. As the turn began, Bismarck straddled Hood with her third and fourth four-gun salvoes and at 06:01 the fifth salvo hit her, causing a large explosion. Flames shot up near Hoods masts, then an orange-coloured fireball and an enormous smoke cloud obliterated the ship. On Prince of Wales, it seemed that Hood collapsed amidships, and the bow and stern could be seen rising as she rapidly settled. Prince of Wales made a sharp starboard turn to avoid hitting the debris {{and in doing so}} further closed the range between her and the German ships. In the four-minute action, Hood, the largest battlecruiser in the world, had been sunk. 1,419 officers and men were killed. Only three men survived.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, {{due in part}} to Cliff Fletcher's {{diplomatic}} efforts, the Soviets gave {{permission for}} a select group of Soviet hockey players to sign with NHL teams. The first of these players was Sergei Pryakhin. Although Pryakhin never became an NHL regular, his arrival <b>blazed</b> a trail for the large number of Russian players who entered the NHL beginning in 1989–90. Sergei Makarov joined the Flames that season and, though already in his thirties, became the fifth Flame to win the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's Rookie of the Year. The selection would prove controversial, prompting the league to amend the rules to exclude any player over the age of 26 from future consideration. That season, the team fell two points shy of their third straight presidents' Trophy with 99 points. Also that season, they won their third straight Smythe Division title. In the playoffs, they were dethroned in six games by the Los Angeles Kings. They would not win another playoff series until 2004—one of the longest such droughts in NHL history.|$|E

5|$|The route {{started at}} St. Joseph, Missouri on the Missouri River, it then {{followed}} what is modern-day U.S. Highway 36 (US36 the Pony Express Highway) to Marysville, Kansas, where it turned northwest following Little Blue River to Fort Kearny in Nebraska. Through Nebraska it followed the Great Platte River Road, cutting through Gothenburg, Nebraska, clipping {{the edge of}} Colorado at Julesburg, Colorado, and passing Courthouse Rock, Chimney Rock, and Scotts Bluff, before arriving at Fort Laramie in Wyoming. From there it followed the Sweetwater River, passing Independence Rock, Devil's Gate, and Split Rock, to Fort Caspar, through South Pass to Fort Bridger and then down to Salt Lake City. From Salt Lake City it generally followed the Central Nevada Route <b>blazed</b> by Captain James H. Simpson of the Corps of Topographical Engineers in 1859. This route roughly follows today's US50 across Nevada and Utah. It crossed the Great Basin, the Utah-Nevada Desert, and the Sierra Nevada near Lake Tahoe before arriving in Sacramento. Mail was then sent via steamer down the Sacramento River to San Francisco. On a few instances when the steamer was missed, riders took the mail via horseback to Oakland, California.|$|E
