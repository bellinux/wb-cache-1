The unexploded shell was later disarmed by a Navy <b>bomb</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>officer</b> in Portsmouth and is currently displayed aboard the ship. Throughout the three-hour duel, the Germans straddled and near-missed Texas over sixty-five times, but she continued her mission firing 206 14-inch shells at Battery Hamburg until ordered to retire at 15:01.|$|E
5|$|On 15 March 1962, a <b>bomb</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>officer</b> {{was killed}} at Lympne when the pipe mine he was {{attempting}} to make safe exploded. The Army temporarily suspended their bomb disposal operations as a result. Skyways supplemented their Dakotas with an Avro 748 (G-ARMV) which operated its first revenue-earning flight on 17 April 1962. In July, {{it was reported that}} Skyways had extended the passenger terminal at Lympne. In November, Skyways was taken over by Euravia, excluding Skyways Coach-Air which remained a separate company.|$|E

2500|$|... 1998, Tony Geraghty: British–Irish {{author and}} {{journalist}} Tony Geraghty {{was arrested and}} his house searched by MDP Special Branch, investigating offences against the Official Secrets Act involving his contact with a former Northern Ireland <b>bomb</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>officer</b> Lt Col Nigel Wylde. Wylde was subsequently charged with passing secrets to Geraghty, but the case collapsed during trial. It caused much concern in the media that the MDP was effectively beyond public accountability and {{had the power to}} impede the freedom of the press.|$|E
500|$|After the attack, {{authorities}} {{started to}} look for other possible bombs in the area, with the Civil Guard giving the order to search in all barracks on the island. Soon after, a detection dog found a bomb attached to another Civil Guard Nissan Patrol {{parked in front of}} a barracks located [...] from where the first bomb had exploded. The area was cordoned off and people evacuated from nearby houses and hotels. At 18.30, Civil Guard <b>bomb</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>officers</b> TEDAX carried out a controlled explosion. The bomb had been placed in a broken down vehicle and was therefore not in use.|$|R
50|$|On 17 November 1998 a lorry {{collided}} with the petrol station between Bar Hill and Lolworth. The incident happened shortly after 11am and killed one person, with many others injured. The road was closed and there were huge tailbacks. On 26 July 2006 the A14 was closed for 24 hours near Newmarket when a van carrying acetylene gas canisters caught fire and the rescue services were advised by British Oxygen that they could remain unstable and needed 24 hours to cool. <b>Bomb</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>officers</b> were called in and the Red Cross set up a centre in Newmarket {{for those who were}} stranded.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bomb</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>officers</b> often wear heavy armor {{designed}} to protect against most effects of a moderate sized explosion, such as bombs encountered in terror threats. Full head helmet, covering the face and some degree of protection for limbs is mandatory in addition to very strong armor for the torso. An insert to protect the spine is usually applied to the back, in case an explosion blasts the wearer. Visibility and mobility of the wearer is severely limited, as is the time that can be spent working on the device. Armor designed primarily to counter explosives is often somewhat less effective against bullets than armor designed for that purpose. The sheer mass of most <b>bomb</b> <b>disposal</b> armor usually provides some protection, and bullet-specific trauma plates are compatible with some <b>bomb</b> <b>disposal</b> suits. <b>Bomb</b> <b>disposal</b> technicians try to accomplish their task if possible using remote methods (e.g., robots, line and pulleys). Actually laying hands on a bomb is only done in an extremely life-threatening situation, where the hazards to people and critical structures cannot be lessened by using wheeled robots or other techniques.|$|R

25|$|At about 17:30 on Friday 17 May 1974, without warning, three {{car bombs}} {{exploded}} in Dublin city centre at Parnell Street, Talbot Street and South Leinster Street during rush hour. The streets all ran east-west from busy thoroughfares to railway stations. There was a bus strike in Dublin at the time, which meant {{there were more}} {{people on the streets}} than usual. According to one of the Irish Army's top <b>bomb</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>officers,</b> Commandant Patrick Trears, the bombs were constructed so well that 100% of each bomb exploded upon detonation. Twenty-three people died in these explosions and three others died from their injuries over the following few days and weeks. Many of the dead were young women originally from rural towns employed in the civil service. An entire family from central Dublin was killed. Two of the victims were foreign: an Italian man, and a French Jewish woman whose family had survived the Holocaust.|$|R
40|$|The social identity/self-categorization {{model of}} stress {{suggests}} that social identity {{can play a}} role in protecting group members from adverse reactions to strain because it provides a basis for group members to receive and benefit from social support. To examine this model, two studies were conducted with groups exposed to extreme levels of strain: patients recovering from heart surgery (Study 1), <b>bomb</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>officers</b> and bar staff (Study 2). Consistent with predictions, in both studies there was a strong positive correlation between social identification and both social support and life/job satisfaction and a strong negative correlation between social identification and stress. In both studies path analysis also indicated that social support was a significant mediator of the relationship between (a) social identification and stress and (b) social identification and life/job satisfaction. In addition, Study 2 revealed that group membership plays a significant role in perceptions of how stressful different types of work are. Implications for the conceptualization of stress and social support are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|The {{car bombs}} detonated in Parnell Street, Talbot Street, and South Leinster Street, at 5.28 p.m., 5.30 p.m. and 5.32 p.m. respectively. No {{warnings}} had been given. According to military experts, {{the placement of}} the car bombs indicated [...] "highly-intelligent military planning by people who knew what they were doing". One of the Irish Army's top <b>bomb</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>officers,</b> Commandant Patrick Trears, declared that the bombs were constructed so well that one hundred per cent of each bomb exploded upon detonation, resulting in the deaths of 26 people, mostly women (including one who was nine-months pregnant). Most of the dead were blasted beyond recognition; one girl who had been near the epicentre of the Talbot Street explosion was decapitated and only her platform boots provided a clue as to her sex. Close to 300 people were injured, many maimed for life. After the blasts the bombers fled from central Dublin in the scout cars and headed back north using the [...] "smuggler's route" [...] of minor and back roads, crossing the Northern Ireland border near Hackballs Cross, County Louth at about 7.30 p.m. Thirty minutes earlier, a fourth car bomb, delivered by a team from the Mid-Ulster UVF's Portadown unit, had exploded in Monaghan, killing an additional seven people.
