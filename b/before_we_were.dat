It {{was not long}} before our hands dragged Helvidius to prison, before we gazed on the dying looks of Manricus and Rusticus, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> steeped in Senecio's innocent blood. Even Nero turned his eyes away, and did not gaze upon the atrocities which he ordered; with Domitian it was the chief part of our miseries to see and to be seen, to know that our sighs were being recorded...|$|E
25|$|During recent decades, {{many people}} in the West have {{developed}} an interest in reincarnation. Recent studies have indicated that some Westerners accept the idea of reincarnation including certain contemporary people who were from Catholic families, modern Neopagans, followers of Spiritism, Theosophists and students of esoteric philosophies such as Kabbalah, and Gnostic and Esoteric Christianity as well as followers of Indian religions. Demographic survey data from 1999–2002 shows a significant minority of people from Europe and America, where there is reasonable freedom of thought and access to ideas but no outstanding recent reincarnationist tradition, believe we had a life <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> born, will survive death and be born again physically. The mean for the Nordic countries is 22%. The belief in reincarnation is particularly high in the Baltic countries, with Lithuania having the highest figure for the whole of Europe, 44%. The lowest figure is in East Germany, 12%. In Russia, about one-third believes in reincarnation. The effect of communist anti-religious ideas on the beliefs of the populations of Eastern Europe seems to have been rather slight, if any, except apparently in East Germany. Overall, 22% of respondents in Western Europe believe in reincarnation. According to a 2005 Gallup poll 20 percent of U.S. adults believe in reincarnation. Recent surveys by the Barna Group, a Christian research nonprofit organization, have found that a quarter of U.S. Christians, including 10 percent of all born again Christians, embrace the idea.|$|E

They had no family in Canada and, after their two children were born, they searched for a spiritual home and joined the Society of Friends (Quakers) in 1964. [...] "We were pacifists <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> Quakers," [...] Franklin says, [...] "but it was a very easy transition to Quakerism for us, and it has been a very good home and an extended family for us and our children." [...] Franklin spent her last years in a nursing home with Fred, who survived her. She died on July 22, 2016 at the age of 94.|$|E

[...] "Three days <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. [...] "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick." ...|$|E

500|$|The Swarm {{received}} mixed {{response in}} its opening season. The park declared the attraction a commercial disappointment in its following years, after disappointing guest attendance to the park; this partially {{led to the}} brief [...] "Brave it backwards" [...] feature in 2013. Blogger Nick Sim of [...] "Theme Park Tourist" [...] praised the attraction, saying that it packs [...] "a number of incredible elements into its compact circuit". Sim stated the ride had [...] "fallen just short of our sky-high expectations" [...] mainly because of [...] "its short ride time". He rated the ride 4 out of 5. Joanna Churchill of the Daily Mirror gave {{a review of the}} backwards ride, stating that it is [...] "a whole new adrenaline-pumped experience that is simply not for the faint-hearted". Churchill stated that her [...] "blood pressure and heart rate went through the roof", but [...] "there was barely time to process what was happening <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> back on terra firma".|$|E
500|$|Church {{explained}} that {{the core of the}} project was its [...] "dynamic creation". He noted that the team had [...] "no set of rules [...] or pre-written plan", but rather worked organically toward the general idea of creating a [...] "dungeon simulation". Church believed that the game's Ultima series heritage was extremely helpful, as it gave the team an anchor for their experiments. According to Church, because the team was young and inexperienced, they were [...] "improvising almost the whole time". He said that they would [...] "just write something" [...] that seemed interesting, but would then [...] "get it half done, and we'd say, 'Eh? That's not working.'" [...] He believed that this iterative method was useful overall, but that it entailed an abnormally large workload: it resulted in the creation of [...] "four movement systems <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> done, several combat systems, and so forth". Certain failed experiments meant that the team created [...] " [...] code for many ideas {{which turned out to be}} largely irrelevant to the actual gameplay".|$|E

[...] He explained, [...] "they saw [...] of the show early on, which is [...] rare because usually a season will be one and aired before a network will renew it because {{they want to know what}} the numbers are, but they, I guess, a bit of a risk on their behalf, but I'm glad they did." [...] The finale scene of the episode is a parody of the ending from the 1977 movie [...] According to Thiessen, the joke was an [...] "afterthought"; originally, there was going to be a more elaborate ending, but due to time constraints, a new finale was created. During the animation stage, one of the directors noted that the scene was [...] "kind of like the ending to A New Hope" [...] and so, the decision was made to create [...] "scene for scene" [...] parody of the original.|$|E

[...] Susannah Wells's neighbours were turned away by the mob and her daughter and half-brother were quickly recognised and stopped. [...] However, three witnesses found in Dorset by George Squires, to testify for his mother, passed by unrecognised. [...] The first, John Gibbons, said that the Squires had visited his house in Abbotsbury [...] "with handkerchiefs, lawns, muslins, and checks, to sell about town" [...] from 1–9January. [...] This was corroborated by his neighbour, William Clarke. [...] Squires's last witness, Thomas Greville, claimed that he had accommodated Mary and [...] "her sister and her brother" [...] under his roof in Coombe, on 14January, where they sold [...] "handkerchiefs, lawns, and such things". [...] This was contradicted by John Iniser, a fishmonger around Waltham Cross and Theobalds. [...] Insier claimed he knew Squires by sight {{and that in the}} three weeks before her arrest he had seen her telling fortunes in the neighbourhood of Wells's house. [...] Wells, whose witnesses had been unable to pass by the mob outside, was able to offer only two sentences in her defence. [...] She told the court that she had not seen Canning before 1February, and that [...] "as to Squires, I never saw her above a week and a day <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> taken up."

2500|$|The {{piece is}} a {{meditation}} on death. Pärt's biographer, Paul Hillier, suggests that [...] "how we live depends on our relationship with death: how we make music depends on our relationship to silence." [...] It is significant that the piece begins and ends with silence—that the silence is written in the score. This silence creates a frame around the piece and has spiritual significance. It suggests that we come from silence, and return to silence; it reminds us that <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> born and after we die we are silent {{with respect to this}} world.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} Animals line-up of Burdon, Price, Valentine, Chandler and Steel reunited for {{a benefit}} concert in Newcastle in December 1968 and re-formed in late 1975 to record again. Burdon later said nobody understood {{why they did}} this short reunion.

They released the album in 1977 aptly called <b>Before</b> <b>We</b> <b>Were</b> So Rudely Interrupted. The album received critical praise. Burdon and Valentine also recorded some demos at that time, which were never released. On 12 December 1982, Burdon performed together with Alan Price and a complete line-up, foreshadowing later events.|$|E
