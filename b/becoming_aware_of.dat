5|$|A {{majority}} of the Privy Council {{moved out of the}} Tower before switching their allegiance. <b>Becoming</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> his colleagues' change of mind, Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk, abandoned his command of the fortress and proclaimed Mary I on nearby Tower Hill. After he had left, his wife was told she could also go home, while Jane, Guildford, and the Duchess of Northumberland were not allowed to. Jane was later moved from the royal apartments to the Gentleman Gaoler's lodgings and Guildford was imprisoned in the Bell Tower. There he was soon joined by his brother, Robert. His remaining brothers were imprisoned in other towers, as was his father, who was for the moment the only prominent person to go to the scaffold; Mary was prepared to spare Jane's and Guildford's lives.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{continued}} to issue orders, Sudirman only returned to active duty on 17December; {{in light of the}} growing tension between the Dutch and Indonesian forces, he ordered the TNI soldiers to maintain an increased level of awareness; he also ordered large-scale military exercises as a in an unsuccessful attempt to convince the Dutch that the TNI was too strong to attack. Two days later, after a nighttime announcement that they were no longer bound by the Renville Agreement, on 19 December the Dutch launched Operation Kraai, an attempt to capture the capital at Yogyakarta. By 07:10 local time (UTC+7), the airfield at Maguwo had been taken by paratroopers under the command of Captain Eekhout. Sudirman, upon <b>becoming</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the attack, had an order read over RRI which stated that soldiers should fight as they had been trained– as guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|Later on that day, a deserter {{from the}} Persian fleet, a Greek called Scyllias, swam into the Allied camp. He brought {{bad news for}} the Allies — whilst most of the Persian fleet was {{undergoing}} repairs, the Persians had detached 200 seaworthy ships to sail around the outer coast of Euboea, to block the escape route of the Allied fleet. The Persians did not want to attack the Allies yet, because they thought the Allies would simply flee, and so they sought to trap them. The Allies resolved to go and meet this detachment, to prevent being trapped, though they planned to leave by nightfall to prevent the Persians <b>becoming</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> their plans.|$|E

5|$|The Xel'Naga then {{discovered}} the Zerg, small parasitic larvae that could control the nervous systems of other species. The Xel'Naga {{saw this as}} purity of essence, and guided {{the evolution of the}} Zerg as well. However, the Zerg were animals, concerned only with self-preservation. To help further the Zerg as a species, the Xel'Naga created the Overmind, a central consciousness to organize the Zerg. They hid their existence from the Overmind, however. On <b>becoming</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> their existence (after being filled with an overriding directive it could not fight off), the Overmind attacked the Xel'Naga, infesting and destroying the greater whole of the race. In StarCraft II Wings of Liberty, Xel'Naga watchtowers provide vision in a large circular radius around the tower.|$|E
5|$|While {{individuals}} with tics are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods of time, doing so {{often results in}} tension or mental exhaustion. People with Tourette's may seek a secluded spot to release their symptoms, or {{there may be a}} marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or at work. Some people with Tourette's may not be aware of the premonitory urge. Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity. They may have tics for several years before <b>becoming</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> premonitory urges. Children may suppress tics while in the doctor's office, so they may need to be observed while they are not aware they are being watched. The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults than children.|$|E
5|$|In 483BC, {{a massive}} new seam of silver {{was found in}} the Athenian mines at Laurium. Themistocles {{proposed}} that the silver should be used to build a new fleet of 200 triremes, while Aristides suggested it should instead be distributed among the Athenian citizens. Themistocles avoided mentioning Persia, deeming that it was too distant a threat for the Athenians to act on, and instead focused their attention on Aegina. At the time, Athens was embroiled in a long-running war with the Aeginetans, and building a fleet would allow the Athenians to finally defeat them at sea. As a result, Themistocles's motion was carried easily, although only 100 warships of the trireme type were to be built. Aristides refused to countenance this; conversely Themistocles was not pleased that only 100 ships would be built. Tension between the two camps built over the winter, so that the ostracism of 482BC became a direct contest between Themistocles and Aristides. In what has been characterized as the first referendum, Aristides was ostracised, and Themistocles's policies were endorsed. Indeed, <b>becoming</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the Persian preparations for the coming invasion, the Athenians voted for the construction of more ships than Themistocles had initially asked for. In the run up to the Persian invasion, Themistocles had thus become the foremost politician in Athens.|$|E

25|$|Marx thus {{extensively}} {{relied on}} a form of dialectical analysis.

25|$|After the {{publishing}} of Hakka New Testament in Shantou in the 1920s, {{the church in}} Taiwan sent Pastor Chung Tien-zhi, a Hakka from Miaoli County, to Shantou and began learn the Romanized Cantonese alphabet. This learning experience enabled him to help the Taiwan Hakka Christians to compile their own dialect version of the Bible. Pastor Chung brought the Shantou Hakka Bible copies to Taiwan, however due to the substantial variances between the Hakka dialects, the Taiwanese Hakka population were unable to fully adopt it, and this low reception resulted in fewer people during that period ever <b>becoming</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> {{the existence of the}} Shantou Hakka Bible version.|$|E

25|$|The {{population}} geneticist Sewall Wright {{focused on}} combinations of genes that interacted as complexes, {{and the effects}} of inbreeding on small relatively isolated populations, which could exhibit genetic drift. In a 1932 paper, he introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape in which phenomena such as cross breeding and genetic drift in small populations could push them away from adaptive peaks, which would in turn allow natural selection to push them towards new adaptive peaks. Wright's model would appeal to field naturalists such as Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr who were <b>becoming</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the importance of geographical isolation in real world populations. The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright helped to found the discipline of theoretical population genetics.|$|E
