6000|$|BURKE--[Suddenly {{holding her}} {{away from him and}} staring into her eyes as if to probe into her soul--slowly.] If your oath is no proper oath at all, I'll have to <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>your</b> naked word for it and have you anyway, I'm thinking--I'm needing you that bad! ...|$|E
60|$|But I {{need not}} write at all fully {{of my work}} here. This book is not about that but about my coming to that. Long before this {{manuscript}} reaches your hands--if ultimately I decide that it shall reach your hands--you will <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>your</b> share, I hope, in this open conspiracy against potentates and prejudices and all the separating powers of darkness.|$|E
60|$|Muf. That your emperor is a tyrant, is most manifest; for {{you were}} born to be Turks, but he has played the Turk with you, and <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>your</b> {{religion}} away.|$|R
6000|$|... "You quite understand, Mr. Hilliard, {{that you}} <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> <b>your</b> life in your hands? And {{that there is}} no possibility, whatever, of our doing {{anything}} for you, if you get into trouble?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Queer idea, this, but {{the stuff}} tastes all right," [...] she acknowledged. [...] "I suppose, if you <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>your</b> dear Miss Dalstan out, you'd go to a {{different}} sort of place, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a {{very kind}} fellow, Bob," [...] he said, coloring, with that little diffident tremor in his voice which gave a certain charm even to Tom's pride and severity, [...] "and I sha'n't forget you again, though I didn't know you this evening. But I can't take the nine sovereigns; I should <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>your</b> little fortune from you, and they wouldn't do me much good either." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And then, ah, yes, then {{followed}} that excursion into politics. Those scathing articles you wrote for La Liberte! It is hardly an {{exaggeration to say}} that they altered the whole aspect of French political thought. Those wonderful speeches you made during your election campaign at Angers. How the people worshipped you! You might have carried your portfolio had you persisted. But you poets are such restless fellows. And after all, I daresay you have really accomplished more by your plays. You remember--no, of course, how could you?--the first night of La Conquette. Shall I ever forget it! I have always reckoned that the crown of your career. Your marriage with Madame Deschenelle--I do not think it was for the public good. Poor Deschenelle's millions--is it not so? Poetry and millions interfere with one another. But a thousand pardons, my dear Paul. You have done so much. It is only right you should now <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>your</b> ease. Your work is finished." ...|$|E
6000|$|The mild answer {{apparently}} goaded their guest to fury. He {{rose from}} his seat, threw back his long dripping hair from his handsome but querulous face, and scattered a few drops on the partners. [...] "Yes, that's just it. That's what gets me! Here you stick, and here you are! And here you'll stick and rust until you starve or drown! Here you are,--two men who ought {{to be out in}} the world, playing your part as grown men,--stuck here like children 'playing house' in the woods; playing work in your wretched mud-pie ditches, and content. Two men not so old that you mightn't <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>your</b> part in the fun of the world, going to balls or theatres, or paying attention to girls, and yet old enough to have married and have your families around you, content to stay in this God-forsaken place; old bachelors, pigging together like poorhouse paupers. That's what gets me! Say you LIKE it? Say you expect by hanging on to make a strike--and what does that amount to? What are YOUR chances? How many of us have made, or are making, more than grub wages? Say you're willing to share and share alike as you do--have you got enough for two? Aren't you actually living off each other? Aren't you grinding each other down, choking each other's struggles, as you sink together deeper and deeper in the mud of this cussed camp? And while you're doing this, aren't you, by your age and position here, holding out hopes to others that you know cannot be fulfilled?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The Grange is shut up," [...] said Sir Jeremy, [...] "and {{has been}} for twenty years. But I keep a man there--Horrod--he was butler in my father's time and before. If you care to go, I'll write him that you're coming. And, since you <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> <b>your</b> own fate in your hands, the fifteenth of November is the day." ...|$|R

40|$|It {{all depends}} on what you mean by 'a drink' and what you mean by 'now and then', A small amount of alcohol does you no harm, and can be enjoyable, But if it's more than a small amount and it's a regular thing, then maybe you shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> <b>your</b> {{drinking}} for granted, Maybe it isn't quite as harmless as you think it is, Drinking is best when you don't overdo it. Drinking too much alcohol- or even drinking a little at the wrong time - can cause problems, Not just hangovers, but accidents - at home, at work and on the road, And it can do serious damage, to your health, to your family and to your self-esteem, not to mention your pocket...|$|E

It made us truly a national movement, when the students came. Their parents had to learn about the South.” ...|$|R

'Is {{it not a}} pleasure, gentlemen,' said he, 'for me, as I am drawing {{near the}} goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now {{thinking}} of appointing a successor?
