40|$|Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) MOSFET's are an {{attractive}} alternative to bulk-silicon MOSFET's in the sub- 100 nm gate length regime due to improved performance and/or scalability. The SOI layer thickness in SOI MOSFET's can be sized {{so that the}} channel is either partially- or fully-depleted-of majority carriers. Partially-depleted (PD) SOI MOSFET's are easier to manufacture than fully-depleted (FD) SOI MOSFET's because a thicker SOI film can be used. However, PDSOI MOSFET's are difficult to design due to floating-body effects. FD-SOI MOSFET's are easier to design and are more scalable than PD-SOI MOSFET's. However, in the sub- 100 nm gate length regime, fully-depleted SOI MOSFET's are difficult to manufacture because a bottom gate is required for electrostatic integrity. In this thesis, floating-body effects in PD-SOI MOSFET's and process technology for fabrication of double-gate FD-SOI MOSFET's will be investigated. Floating-body effects in PD-SOI MOSFET's result from floating-body voltage modulation by AC and DC changes in source, drain, gate, and substrate terminal voltages. This modulation of the floating-body voltage results in modulation of the drain current. AC modulation of the floating-body voltage occurs through capacitive coupling to rapidly switching terminal voltages. DC modulation of the floating-body voltage occurs through diode currents and impact ionization. Because the time constants of these processes are very different, the DC and AC I-V behavior of floating-body PD-SOI MOSFET's {{are very different from}} each other, as well as very different from body-contacted SOI MOSFET's or bulk MOSFET's with the body tied to a fixed voltage. Floating-body effects on I-V behavior, how they are important in CMOS digital operation, and how they are affected by device design are described and modeled. Another consequence of floating-body behavior is history dependence in I-V behavior. Rapid switching of terminal voltages induce nearly-negligible changes in <b>body</b> majority <b>carrier</b> content since <b>body</b> majority <b>carriers</b> are trapped by body-source/drain junction diodes. However, the change in <b>body</b> majority <b>carrier</b> content can become significant over many switching cycles, eventually reaching a "switching-steady-state" value if kept switching (different value for different switching patterns), and can return to the initial value if the terminal voltages are returned to the initial settings and enough time is allowed to reach equilibrium. This "hysteretic" variation of the body majority hole content is problematic because device I-V behavior changes with changing <b>body</b> majority <b>carrier</b> content. Device design to minimize hysteretic behavior will be presented. Once the hysteretic I-V behavior of floating-body PD-SOI MOSFET's has been understood, floating-body PD-SOI CMOS technology can be optimized to maximize drive current while minimizing hysteresis. This optimized PD-SOI technology can then be compared to bulk CMOS technology. This was done using the 2 -D numerical simulator MEDICI in a optimization framework based on the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors for the 100 nm-, 70 nm-, and 50 nm-technology nodes. And finally, double-gate fully-depleted SOI MOSFET's technology was explored. A method to fabricate bury a bottom-gate under a FD-SOI MOSFET was developed based on a flip-bond- transfer technique. This technique is based on chemical-mechanical-polish and wafer fusion bonding. Double-gate SOI MOSFET's were fabricated based with this technique, and a self-alignment scheme for alignment of the bottom-gate which to the top-gate was explored. by Andy Wei. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Linear programming was used to model a dairy farm, including multiple restrictions on product output and production factor input. Management was optimized to maximize labour income.

40|$|Carrying loads on {{the human}} body is one of the {{characteristics}} of human beings in the wild. Load influences the <b>carrier’s</b> <b>body</b> construction, his/her posture and his/her body economy, so carrying loads without disadvantage would be valuable for human beings, especially, for early human beings. In this paper the author describes and analyzes the load-carrying behavior of the Boyela, a horticulturalist group inhabiting the middle of the Congo (ex-Zaire) Forest. The postures of carriers carrying load on their own bodies were classified according to four criteria: what kind of objects were carried, where was the position of the objects carried on the <b>carrier’s</b> <b>body,</b> what was the body part supporting the load, and whether tools for supporting the load were used or not. The postures for carrying general goods, such as commodities, were classified into 26 types and those for carrying infants or babies into 9 types. There were striking differences between both sexes in frequency, measure of load, and posture type adopted in carrying objects on his/her own body. There were also differences between two ethnic groups in posture type and carrying tools used. The author considered that these differences did not resulted from physiological or anatomical factors, but ecological, socio-cultural or psycological factors. From the viewpoint of the evolution of bipedal locomotion, the author evaluated the significance of shoulders as the most principal body part for supporting load, as well as hands and arms which contributed to the occurrence of various posture types in carrying objects, and carrying tools which would make transport efficiency progress dramatically...|$|R
