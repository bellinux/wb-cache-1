50|$|The initial blends {{consisting}} of Bordeaux wines from the 1934 and 1937 vintages, along with simple German and Italian wine, were sold from January 1, 1946 for NOK total of 4.50, both Rødvin and Hvitvin (White wine), all sold out by 1947. As the successive imports of wine from Algeria, Tunisia and Chile marketed under other names failed to sell well, an initiative {{was made in}} 1949 to compose a new <b>blended</b> <b>wine</b> for the people, affordable and easily drinkable. Purchasing director Haakon Svensson was given a set budget and assigned to negotiate deals with wine producers, initially securing deals with winemakers from Le Midi, Valencia and Algeria, with an aim to produce a <b>blended</b> <b>wine</b> that could decrease the Norwegian people's vast consumption of liquor, at the time ten to one {{the ratio of the}} consumption of wine.|$|R
40|$|The multi-yeast strain {{composition}} of wine fermentations {{has been well}} established. However, the effect of multiple strains of Saccharomyces spp. on wine flavour is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that multiple strains of Saccharomyces grown together in grape juice can affect the profile of aroma compounds that accumulate during fermentation. A metabolic footprint of each yeast in monoculture, mixed cultures or <b>blended</b> <b>wines</b> was derived by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry measurement of volatiles accumulated during fermentation. The resultant ion spectrograms were transformed and compared by principal-component analysis. The principal-component analysis showed that the profiles of compounds present in wines made by mixed-culture fermentation were different from those where yeasts were grown in monoculture fermentation, and these differences could not be produced by <b>blending</b> <b>wines.</b> <b>Blending</b> of monoculture <b>wines</b> to mimic the population {{composition of}} mixed-culture wines showed that yeast metabolic interactions could account for these differences. Additionally, the yeast strain contribution of volatiles to a mixed fermentation cannot be predicted by the population of that yeast. This study provides a novel way to measure the population status of wine fermentations by metabolic footprinting...|$|R

50|$|Wines in Slovenia have {{traditionally}} follow the Austrian preference of single varietal over <b>blended</b> <b>wines</b> but {{the production of}} <b>blended</b> <b>wines</b> are on the rise. While wines were historically aged in large Slovenian or Slavonian wooden cask, the trend has been to use small and varying sizes of French and Slovenian oak barrels. In the Littoral both red and white wines often go through Malolactic fermentation with Podravje and Posavje typically using that technique only for red wine production. In the Littoral, dessert wines are made in a passito style with the Brda region specialize in wines made from Verduc and Pikolit. In the Drava Valley region, botrytized wines are produced from Laški Rizling, Renski Rizling and Šipon and classified in a system similar to the German wine classification based on sweetness-ranging from pozna trgatev (Spätlese), izbor (Auslese), jagodni izbor (Beerenauslese), ledeno vino (Eiswein) and suhi jagodni izbor (Trockenbeerenauslese).|$|R
