Martha {{promptly}} arrives and fills the house with the Christmas decorations Marge has always dreamed of, but the other family members end up as part of the decorations instead of being able to enjoy the holiday with her. Marge quickly realizes that it is Homer and the children that make Christmas special for her, so Martha gets rid of all the decorations with a magic wand. Marge then wakes up on Christmas Day to find that her family has brought her the ingredients for <b>breakfast</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b> Their attempts to cook it go awry, so they go out for breakfast instead.|$|E
5|$|Late one night, Ashley (Ashley Ryder)– a {{young man}} with a childlike mentality– arrives at the caravan home of his Uncle David (David Hoyle) on the Isle of Sheppey. Ashley confides in his uncle that his mother has been {{physically}} abusing him by stubbing cigarettes out on his hand. David lambasts the mother and society in general; the two embrace in a kiss before going to bed together. The next morning, they awake and have <b>breakfast</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> before David bathes Ashley in the bathtub, telling him a story about an unhappy nuclear family. Going to a local café and then a park bench, David continues to explain his anti-establishment opinions about society. Ashley reveals that he wants to die, and the two express their love for one another.|$|E
25|$|Cowell {{typically}} works {{into the}} morning, wakes up at noon and has <b>breakfast</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b> His breakfast consists {{of hot water}} with lemon, papaya juice with lime, oatmeal, tea, and health smoothies. Cowell smokes Kool cigarettes and his favourite beers are Corona and Sapporo.|$|E
60|$|Sir John was <b>breakfasting</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b> His {{chocolate}} and toast stood upon a little table at his elbow; books and newspapers lay ready to his hand, upon the coverlet; and, sometimes pausing to glance {{with an air}} of tranquil satisfaction round the well-ordered room, and sometimes to gaze indolently at the summer sky, he ate, and drank, and read the news luxuriously.|$|R
60|$|He {{reached the}} ancient hamlet while {{the people were}} at breakfast. Weary and mud-bespattered, but quite possessed of his {{ordinary}} clearness of brain, he sat down by the well, thinking {{as he did so}} what a poor Christ he made. Seeing a trough of water near he bathed his face, and went on to the cottage of his great-aunt, whom he found <b>breakfasting</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> attended by the woman who lived with her.|$|R
60|$|Muriel was a Persian cat {{belonging}} to Lady Ann Warblington. Lady Ann had <b>breakfasted</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> and lain there late, as she rather fancied {{she had one}} of her sick headaches coming on. Muriel had left her room {{in the wake of}} the breakfast tray, being anxious to be present at the obsequies of a fried sole that had formed Lady Ann's simple morning meal, and had followed the maid who bore it until she had reached the hall.|$|R
500|$|After dismissing Anthony Julius, a Mishcon de Reya lawyer, Mills stated {{she would}} {{represent}} {{herself in the}} upcoming divorce hearing, with help from her sister Fiona, David Rosen, a solicitor-advocate, and Michael Shilub, an American attorney. In leaked documents, Mills complained that McCartney was often drunk, smoked cannabis, stabbed her with a broken wine glass, pushed her over a table, and pushed her into a bathtub when she was pregnant. Referring to her part in the marriage, Mills {{said that she had}} been a full-time wife, mother, lover, confidante, business partner and psychologist to McCartney. McCartney's lawyers studied Mills's book: Life Balance: The Essential Keys to a Lifetime of Wellbeing (2006), as it contradicted many of her claims, such as when she praised McCartney for [...] "Bringing me <b>breakfast</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> every morning, no matter how he feels, and I do the dinner, so we've got that agreement. It's thoughtfulness". Mills's father reconciled with his daughter after meeting her and McCartney, when they introduced him to his granddaughter, Beatrice. After their separation, he said that it [...] "took guts to represent yourself at the High Court", and that he was proud of his daughter, even though he thought she would be [...] "torn to shreds" [...] by McCartney's lawyers.|$|E
500|$|The Sealyham surged in {{popularity}} after the First World War in the UK and the United States. Within the Hollywood film industry, the Sealyham became a fashionable dog to own by the Hollywood elite. The terrier {{was owned by}} actors Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davies, Elizabeth Taylor, and by writer Agatha Christie. Cary Grant owned one which he named Archie Leach [...] Grant's real name. Alfred Hitchcock had one of his Sealyham terriers seen in his 1941 film Suspicion. Alfred Hitchcock {{can also be seen}} at the start of his 1963 film, The Birds, walking two of his Sealyham Terriers in a cameo appearance, although he also owned a third Sealyham not featured in the movie. The British Royal Family also favoured these dogs; King George V owned a dog named Jack. In 1959 one Sunday newspaper reported in the UK: [...] "A notice has been posted in Clarence House and Windsor Castle giving explicit instructions that when Princess Margaret has <b>breakfast</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> her two Sealyhams must be brought to the room along with her breakfast tray." [...] These two dogs were called Pippin and Johnny, and were looked after by the Queen Mother when Princess Margaret fell ill. In the 1960s, children's author Maurice Sendak owned a Sealyham named Jennie, which he featured in his 1967 work Higglety Pigglety Pop!.|$|E
500|$|As their {{relationship}} progresses, Audrey invites Lewis {{to move in}} with her. Nicholls told Suzanne Byrne of RTÉ Ten that Lewis appears to brush Audrey off, before eventually agreeing to move in. Nicholls said, [...] "And then in his usual charming style he brings her <b>breakfast</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> on her birthday, which she adores him for. He's clever like that, he knows how to bring the balance back to the relationship." [...] In May 2010, the Daily Mirror's Brian Roberts reported that a new plot for Audrey and Lewis could see them leaving Weatherfield for a new life in Greece. The couple go on holiday to a Greek island and Audrey is taken with Lewis' idea of opening a hotel and living a glamorous life out there. Roberts likened the plot development to that of the 1989 film, Shirley Valentine. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury noted that Lewis seemed uncomfortable with the plan; Nicholls said that Audrey is unaware of his doubts. Laws also compared the plot to a similar one in another ITV soap opera, Emmerdale, involving Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen) and Charlie Haynes (George Costigan), and predicted that both storylines would end in heartache. Nicholls wanted Audrey and Lewis to leave together and have a happy ending, and wanted to see a spin-off series focusing on the pair and their new life in Greece. Olivia Buxton from the Daily Mirror questioned whether Lewis would go through with the plan; she wrote that two endings to his story arc had been filmed, one of which showed him making a dramatic exit.|$|E
60|$|Of course, {{he thanked}} his stars--and Miss Ramsbotham--that the {{engagement}} {{had never been}} formal. So far as Mr. Peters was concerned, there was an end to Mistress Peggy's dream of an existence of everlasting <b>breakfasts</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b> Leaving the Ramsbotham flat, {{she returned to the}} maternal roof, and there a course of hard work and plain living tended greatly to improve her figure and complexion; so that in course of time, the gods smiling again upon her, she married a foreman printer, and passes out of this story.|$|R
60|$|While she {{was talking}} in this mortifying manner, I felt some {{consolation}} nevertheless. Oscar's disfigured complexion {{would not be the}} terrible obstacle {{in the way of his}} restoration to Lucilla that I had feared. All the comfort which this reflection could give, I wanted badly enough. There was no open hostility towards me on Lucilla's part--but there was a coolness which I found more distressing to bear than hostility itself. I <b>breakfasted</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> the next morning, and only rose towards noon--just in time to say good-bye to Grosse before he returned to London.|$|R

'Then {{take your}} tea at once I beg,' said Flora, 'and this wing of fowl and bit of ham, don't mind me or wait for me, because I always carry in this tray myself to Mr F.'s Aunt who <b>breakfasts</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> and a charming old lady too and very clever, Portrait of Mr F. {{behind the door}} and very like though too much {{forehead}} and as to a pillar with a marble pavement and balustrades and a mountain, I never saw him near it nor not likely in the wine trade, excellent man but not at all in that way.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Near {{the end of}} her career, Chambers {{appeared}} {{primarily in}} independent films, including her last role in Solitaire. Chambers claimed that the more laid-back pace of these roles suited her as [...] "there's a lot less pressure on you to perform [...] you don't have to be young and skinny". Among these were Bikini Bistro, Angel of H.E.A.T. (with Mary Woronov), Party Incorporated, and <b>Breakfast</b> <b>in</b> <b>Bed.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Kéllé {{experienced}} minor success {{after leaving}} Eternal {{in the form}} of a no. 14 single called [...] "Higher Than Heaven" [...] in October 1999, but her debut solo album, <b>Breakfast</b> <b>in</b> <b>Bed,</b> was never released. [...] A second single, [...] "I Wanna Know", was cancelled due to further health issues. She went on to launch her own artist management company, Red Hot Entertainment and finished as the female runner up on the reality TV show Love Island. Kéllé appeared in the BBC sitcom series Me and Mrs. Jones (2012) with Neil Morrisey. Kéllé, who is now a Mother of 2, can be found on Twitter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Prendero la mia collazzione al letto." [...] Was {{that right}} for <b>breakfast</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed?</b> Because {{she would have}} <b>breakfast</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> always. And when she got up there would be lovely looking glasses with three panels where one could see oneself sideface. She saw herself leaning forward, {{powdering}} her nose, carefully, scientifically. With the monkey creeping up behind? Ooh. Horrible! Ho paura di questa scimmia, questo scimmione.|$|E
6000|$|The bishop's hand brushed over Archbishop Pontifex, who {{was just}} coming down to <b>breakfast</b> <b>in</b> his palace. This pompous old man {{was dressed in a}} purple garment that set off his tall figure very finely, and he was holding out his episcopal ring for his guests to kiss, that being the {{customary}} morning greeting of Archbishop Pontifex. The thought of that ring-kissing had made much hard work at lower levels [...] "worth while" [...] to Archbishop Pontifex. And seventy miles away from him old Likeman <b>breakfasted</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> on Benger's food, and searched his Greek Testament for tags to put to his letters. And here was the familiar palace at Princhester, and in an armchair in his bed-room sat Bishop Scrope insensible and motionless, in a trance in which he was dreaming of the coming of God.|$|R
60|$|Went {{to bed at}} 8.30 and {{continued}} to make notes and read books and newspapers till midnight. Slept until 8, <b>breakfasted</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> and lay till noon, because {{there had been a}} very heavy rain in the night and the day was still dark and lowering. But at noon the sun broke through and in 15 minutes we were tramping toward the river. Got afloat at 1 p. m. but at 2.40 we had to rush suddenly ashore and take refuge in the above village. Just as we got ourselves and traps safely housed in the inn, the rain let go and came down in great style. We lost {{an hour and a half}} there, but we are off again, now, with bright sunshine.|$|R

5000|$|But {{a few of}} {{the stars}} {{themselves}} had ready answers.

[...] Joan Crawford had just signed a new five-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer at a figure reported to be $1,500,000. [...] "Box Office Poison?" [...] chirruped actress Crawford.

[...] "When business is bad they just re-run one of my pictures...

60|$|Nicholas {{followed}} the young lady, and was shown {{into a small}} apartment on the first floor, communicating with a back-room; in which, as he judged from a certain half-subdued clinking sound, as of cups and saucers, Miss Snevellicci was then taking her <b>breakfast</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
60|$|On {{the morning}} of James' birthday, August the 5th, they felt {{extraordinary}} animation, and little notes passed between them by the hand of Smither while they were having <b>breakfast</b> <b>in</b> their <b>beds.</b> Smither must go round and take their love and little presents {{and find out how}} Mr. James was, and whether he had passed a good night with all the excitement. And on the way back would Smither call in at Green Street--it was a little out of her way, but she could take the bus up Bond Street afterwards; it would be a nice little change for her--and ask dear Mrs. Dartie to be sure and look in before she went out of town.|$|R
6000|$|But I {{will not}} weary you {{with more of}} my {{experiences}} that day and the next. I knew more and more certainly that I should die under the operation; at times I think I was inclined to pose to myself. The doctors were coming at eleven, and I did not get up. It seemed scarce worth while to trouble about washing and dressing, and though I read my newspapers and the letters that came by the first post, I did not find them very interesting. There was a friendly note from Addison, my old school-friend, calling my attention to two discrepancies and a printer's error in my new book, with one from Langridge venting some vexation over Minton. The rest were business communications. I <b>breakfasted</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b> The glow of pain at my side seemed more massive. I knew it was pain, and yet, if you can understand, I did not find it very painful. I had been awake and hot and thirsty in the night, but <b>in</b> the morning <b>bed</b> felt comfortable. <b>In</b> the night-time I had lain thinking {{of things that were}} past; in the morning I dozed over the question of immortality. Haddon came, punctual to the minute, with a neat black bag; and Mowbray soon followed. Their arrival stirred me up a little. I began to take a more personal interest in the proceedings. Haddon moved the little octagonal table close to the bedside, and, with his broad back to me, began taking things out of his bag. I heard the light click of steel upon steel. My imagination, I found, was not altogether stagnant. [...] "Will you hurt me much?" [...] I said in an off-hand tone.|$|R
60|$|He 'did {{not much}} regard it, {{because he could}} in some measure account for it; for that {{a few days before}} he had been with Mrs. Dawson, when a robin-redbreast flew into her room.' On the morning of Saturday he told the same ladies that he was very well, and {{believed}} he should 'BILK THE GHOST.' The dream has become an apparition! On that day--Saturday--he, with the ladies, Fortescue, and Wolsley, went to Pitt Place; he went to bed after eleven, ordered rolls for <b>breakfast,</b> and, <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> 'died without a groan,' as his servant was disengaging him from his waistcoat. During dinner he had 'a rising in his throat' (a slight sickness), 'a thing which had often happened to him before.' His physician, Dr. Fothergill, vaguely attributed his death to the rupture of some vessel in his side, where he had felt a pain in summer.|$|R

He perceived that he had slept all night on the lounge, and he sent a cheery hail into his wife's room, and then followed it to tell her how he had thought it all out.

6000|$|My Aunt Ablewhite is a large, silent, fair-complexioned woman, {{with one}} {{noteworthy}} {{point in her}} character. From the hour of her birth {{she has never been}} known to do anything for herself. She has gone through life, accepting everybody's help, and adopting everybody's opinions. A more hopeless person, in a spiritual point of view, I have never met with--there is absolutely, in this perplexing case, no obstructive material to work upon. Aunt Ablewhite would listen to the Grand Lama of Thibet exactly as she listens to Me, and would reflect his views quite as readily as she reflects mine. She found the furnished house at Brighton by stopping at an hotel in London, composing herself on a sofa, and sending for her son. She discovered the necessary servants by <b>breakfasting</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> one morning (still at the hotel), and giving her maid a holiday on condition that the girl [...] "would begin enjoying herself by fetching Miss Clack." [...] I found her placidly fanning herself in her dressing-gown at eleven o'clock. [...] "Drusilla, dear, I want some servants. You are so clever--please get them for me." [...] I looked round the untidy room. The church-bells were going for a week-day service; they suggested a word of affectionate remonstrance on my part. [...] "Oh, aunt!" [...] I said sadly. [...] "Is THIS worthy of a Christian Englishwoman? Is the passage from time to eternity to be made in THIS manner?" [...] My aunt answered, [...] "I'll put on my gown, Drusilla, if you will be kind enough to help me." [...] What was to be said after that? I have done wonders with murderesses--I have never advanced an inch with Aunt Ablewhite. [...] "Where is the list," [...] I asked, [...] "of the servants whom you require?" [...] My aunt shook her head; she hadn't even energy enough to keep the list. [...] "Rachel has got it, dear," [...] she said, [...] "in the next room."

60|$|Winnie’s {{mother was}} a stout, wheezy woman, with a large brown face. She wore a black wig under a white cap. Her swollen legs {{rendered}} her inactive. She considered herself to be of French descent, {{which might have been}} true; and after a good many years of married life with a licensed victualler of the more common sort, she provided for the years of widowhood by letting furnished apartments for gentlemen near Vauxhall Bridge Road in a square once of some splendour and still included in the district of Belgravia. This topographical fact was of some advantage in advertising her rooms; but the patrons of the worthy widow were not exactly of the fashionable kind. Such as they were, her daughter Winnie helped to look after them. Traces of the French descent which the widow boasted of were apparent in Winnie too. They were apparent in the extremely neat and artistic arrangement of her glossy dark hair. Winnie had also other charms: her youth; her full, rounded form; her clear complexion; the provocation of her unfathomable reserve, which never {{went so far as to}} prevent conversation, carried on on the lodgers’ part with animation, and on hers with an equable amiability. It must be that Mr Verloc was susceptible to these fascinations. Mr Verloc was an intermittent patron. He came and went without any very apparent reason. He generally arrived in London (like the influenza) from the Continent, only he arrived unheralded by the Press; and his visitations set in with great severity. He <b>breakfasted</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> and remained wallowing there with an air of quiet enjoyment till noon every day—and sometimes even to a later hour. But when he went out he seemed to experience a great difficulty in finding his way back to his temporary home in the Belgravian square. He left it late, and returned to it early—as early as three or four in the morning; and on waking up at ten addressed Winnie, bringing <b>in</b> the <b>breakfast</b> tray, with jocular, exhausted civility, in the hoarse, failing tones of a man who had been talking vehemently for many hours together. His prominent, heavy-lidded eyes rolled sideways amorously and languidly, the bedclothes were pulled up to his chin, and his dark smooth moustache covered his thick lips capable of much honeyed banter.|$|R
