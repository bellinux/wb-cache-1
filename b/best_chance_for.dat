The competitors in the team event all made their first Olympic debut. The group was considered Israel's <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> a gold at the Olympics after they had finished in first place for the hoops and clubs disciplines at the European Championships. In the first round, Israel finished in sixth place. The team performed worse in the second round, with their score the worst among all teams. The group all-around achieved a total of 34.883 points and qualified for the final after finishing in sixth place in the qualification round.

25|$|At the AERA {{convention}} in May 1868, Stone presented {{two forms of}} petition to Congress, one for woman suffrage in the District of Columbia and territories, which could be established by an Act of Congress, and the second for a separate woman suffrage amendment to the federal Constitution. As the petitions circulated in both {{the east and the}} west during the following months, Blackwell and Stone continued organizing a woman suffrage movement separate from the AERA and its auxiliaries. In November 1868 they helped found a New England Woman Suffrage Association and in December they helped organize state societies in Rhode Island and New Hampshire. Believing their <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> winning an amendment to a state constitution lay in Massachusetts, Blackwell spearheaded a movement to form Liberty Leagues across the state – local organizations of male suffragists who pledged to vote only for pro-woman suffrage candidates to the legislature.|$|E
25|$|Where the finder is an employee, {{most cases}} hold that the find should be {{awarded to the}} {{employer}} {{if it has a}} heightened legal obligation to take care of its customers' property, otherwise it should go to the employee. A find occurring in a bank is generally awarded to the bank as the owner is likely to have been a bank customer and the bank has a fiduciary duty to try to reunite lost property with their owners. For similar reasons, common carriers are preferred to passengers and hotels to guests (but only where finds occur in guest rooms, not common areas). The view has been taken that such a rule is suitable for recently misplaced objects as it provides the <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> them to be reunited with their owners. However, it effectively delivers title of old artefacts to landowners, since the older an object is, the less likely it is that the original depositor will return to claim it. The rule is therefore of little or no relevance to objects of archaeological value.|$|E
25|$|Oskar Lafontaine, elected SPD {{chairman}} in November 1996 {{had in the}} run-up to the election forgone a bid for the SPD nomination for the chancellor candidacy, after Gerhard Schröder won a sweeping re-election victory as prime minister of his state of Lower Saxony and was widely believed to be the <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> Social Democrats to regain the Chancellorship after 16 years in opposition. From the beginning of this teaming up between Party chair Lafontaine and chancellor candidate Schröder during the election campaign 1998, rumors in the media about their internal rivalry persisted, albeit always being disputed by the two. After the election victory Lafontaine joined the government as finance minister. The rivalry between the two party leaders escalated in March 1999 leading to the overnight resignation of Lafontaine from all his party and government positions. After staying initially mum about the reasons for his resignation, Lafontaine later cited strong disagreement with the alleged neoliberal and anti-social course Schröder had taken the government on. Schröder himself has never commented on the row with Lafontaine. It is known however, that they haven't spoken to each other ever since. Schröder succeeded Lafontaine as party chairman.|$|E

Of these, 297Og, might provide the <b>best</b> <b>chances</b> <b>for</b> obtaining longer-lived nuclei, and thus might {{become the focus of}} future work with this element.

Finally, Desha claimed that under Holley, Transylvania had become too elitist {{and could not be}} otherwise, given the high cost of attendance. Holley, who had traveled to Frankfort to speak with Desha and the legislature, was present for Desha's speech. Afterward, he decided instead to return to Lexington and tender his resignation. Sympathetic members of the university's board of trustees convinced Holley to remain for another year. Kentucky historian James C.

500|$|Livingstone {{joined the}} Labour Party in March 1968, {{when he was}} 23 years old, later {{describing}} it as [...] "one of the few recorded instances of a rat climbing aboard a sinking ship". At the time, many leftists were leaving in disgust at the Labour government's support for the U.S. in the Vietnam War, cuts to the National Health Service budget, and restrictions on trade unions; some joined far-left parties like the International Socialists or the Socialist Labour League, or single-issue groups like the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Child Poverty Action Group. Suffering mass electoral defeat at the local elections, in London, Labour lost 15 boroughs, including Livingstone's London Borough of Lambeth, which came under Conservative control. Contrastingly, Livingstone believed that grassroots campaigning – such as the 1968 student protests – were ineffective, joining Labour because he considered it the <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> implementing progressive political change in the UK.|$|E

Weeks later, Schultz requested that two separate trials be used to determine whether Bennett's group committed fraud and subsequently determine a remedy.

500|$|Hubert Humphrey was a Minnesotan {{who became}} a nationally {{prominent}} politician. He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes. [...] As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> <b>for</b> political success was to obtain {{the support of the}} Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party. [...] Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue. [...] Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. [...] He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine. [...] This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform. [...] He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.|$|E

Hanna never forgave {{what he saw as}} Foraker's treason. [...] After 1888, there was a strong dislike between the two men, and the separation split the Ohio Republican Party into two factions, a rupture that did not heal until after Hanna's death in 1904. [...] Foraker stated in his memoirs that the break occurred because Hanna bribed black delegates from the South in 1888. [...] However, Ohio newspaper publisher J. B. Morrow contradicted Foraker's account, stating: [...] "I was at the convention in 1888 and know Senator Foraker [...] brought great scandal to the Ohio people who were there and to the delegates with his secret work with Mr. Blaine's friends... Mr. Hanna became thoroughly angered at what he thought was Senator Foraker's bad faith."
