They are characterized by the use of tubes, thus allowing an extended different variety of shapes. Now a day, the automotive industry is showing interest in THF. The benefits of THF can, for instance, be combined with the high strength of extra high strength steels, which are usually less formable, to produce structural automotive components which exhibit lower weight and improved service performance. Design and production of tubular components require knowledge about tube material behaviour and tribological effects during hydro-forming and how the hydro-forming operation itself should be controlled. The THF process is a relatively complex manufacturing process; the performance of this process depends on various factors and requires proper combination of part design, material selection and boundary conditions. Due to the complex nature of the process, the behaviour of the process will be done in the simulation study. The simulation model will be prepared and analyzed by FEM tool DEFORM- 3 D.

40|$|White spot {{syndrome}} virus (WSSV) {{is one of}} {{the most}} prevalent and lethal viruses for shrimp, and oral administration of VP 28 is a promising approach to protect shrimp against WSSV. Although seven heterologous expression systems have been successful since 2004, no one has been commercialized in shrimp industry. This paper presented the idea of “both drug and feed from the same feedstock” to develop oral vaccine against WSSV. Filamentous, heterocystous cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, was used to express major envelope protein, VP 28, for feeding post larvae of shrimp. The expression of vp 28 gene in transgenic mutant was analyzed by Western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). For vaccination, Litopenaeus vannamei was orally administrated by feeding the wild type and mutants of Anabaena cells for 10 days, and was challenged with WSSV during 10 days post vaccination. The post larvae were fed with the mutant harboring vp 28 (10 μg shrimp − 1). The post larvae were divided five groups and their survivals were as follows: (1) negative control (neither vaccination nor challenge), 100 %; (2) positive control (challenge and no vaccination), 0 %; (3) feeding the wild type, 15. 5 %; (4) <b>feeding</b> <b>blank,</b> 20. 6 %; and (5) feeding the mutant harboring vp 28, 68. 0 %. Moreover, the post larvae fed the mutant harboring vp 28 grew better than no feed. Also, the photosynthetic features indicated the transgenic mutant was easier to cultivate.

40|$|Yeast-extracts {{derived from}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{can be used}} as feed {{additive}} to improve animal health by promoting intestinal flora and by stimulating the immune system (Patterson, 2005). The impact of such feed additives on intestinal absorption of antibiotics has however not been described yet. T- 2 toxin is an emerging Fusarium mycotoxin, that can be present as feed contaminant and for which it is known it disturbs the intestinal integrity. It was therefore the aim of the present study to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of orally administered chlortetracycline in pigs after intake of 100 µg/kg T- 2 toxin contaminated feed whether or not supplemented with a commercially available yeast-extract feed additive. Twenty-four 9 -week-old pigs (Landrace) were randomized into a control group (n = 6) and three experimental groups (each n = 6). After an acclimatization period of one week, the groups were given respectively <b>blank</b> <b>feed</b> (control group), <b>blank</b> <b>feed</b> supplemented with the additive (Alphamune®, Pfizer, Belgium), feed experimentally contaminated with 111 µg T- 2 /kg feed and T- 2 contaminated feed supplemented with the additive. Two hours after the start of intake of the respective feeds, the animals were given a single oral intragastric bolus of chlortetracycline at 20 mg/kg BW (bolus 1) (Aurofac®, Alpharma, Belgium). Blood samples were taken at 30 ’, 1 h, 1. 30 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h post administration. Next, after 21 days of intake of the experimental feeds, the animals were given a second oral bolus of chlortetracycline (20 mg/kg BW) (bolus 2). Blood samples were collected as described for bolus 1. Plasma concentrations of chlortetracycline were determined using an in-house validated HPLC-UV method. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC 0 - 24 h) were determined by means of the WinNonlin®, Version 6. 2. 0 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA) software program. After euthanizing the animals, samples of duodenum, jejunum and ileum were taken to determine villus length and crypt depth. Also the effect on the mucous layer was studied using a RT-PCR method for determination of mucin 1 and 2.

40|$|A {{dedicated}} cell-line {{was developed}} by the Department of Toxicology of Wageningen University in a joined project with the University of California in Davis and the RIKILT-WUR - Institute of Food Safety in Wageningen. This DR-CALUX ® bioassay was tested, optimised and validated for its use to determine low elevated levels of dioxins in bovine milk around the existing limits. It was shown that this mammalian cell based test is very sensitive for 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted dioxins and related PCBs, thereby reflecting the relative potencies (TEF) of these compounds as set by the World Health Organisation (WHO). These toxic equivalency factors (WHO-TEFs) express the toxicity of a compound in comparison to the most toxic compound congener 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, TEF= 1). The response obtained with a mixture of dioxins was additive, in accordance with the TEQ-principle. Milk fat was isolated by centrifugation followed by clean-up of the fat with n-pentane, removal of the fat on a 33 % H 2 SO 4 silica column, and determination of Ah receptor agonist activity with the DR-CALUX ® bioassay. To investigate the performance of this 33 % H 2 SO 4 silica method, milk fat was cleaned with activated carbon and spiked with a mixture of 17 different 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted PCDD and PCDF congeners at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 pg WHO-TEQ per g fat, as confirmed by GC/MS. In this concentration range, the method showed a recovery of TEQs around 67 % (58 - 87 %). The reproducibility showed a coefficient of variation (CV) varying between 4 % and 54 %, {{with the exception of the}} sample spiked at 1 pg WHO-TEQ/g (CV 97 %). The repeatability determined with the sample spiked at 6 pg WHO-TEQ per g showed a CV of 10 % These results clearly demonstrate that the reproducibility of the silica-CALUX procedure with samples containing more than 1 pg WHO-TEQ per g fat is relatively good, in particular regarding the fact that no internal standards could be used in the assay for correction of data for varying recoveries. The fact that the CV was much higher for the sample spiked at the lowest level, confirmed the calculated limit of quantification of 1 pg WHO-TEQ per g fat. The current tolerance limit for bovine milk in the EU is 3 pg WHO-TEQ per g fat, with an action limit of 2 pg WHO-TEQ per g fat. Therefore, the DR-CALUX ® bioassay can be a useful pre-screening tool for selecting milk samples that may contain dioxin levels exceeding this tolerance limit. This was supported by the results obtained with 22 field samples, since all five samples exceeding the 2 pg WHO-TEQ per g fat concentration gave a higher response in the DR-CALUX ® bioassay. The DR-CALUX ® bioassay in combination with the 33 % H 2 SO 4 clean-up procedure results in a specific test for the determination of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, allowing the screening of relatively large sets of samples for the presence of unacceptable high levels of these compounds. This results in a reduction of costs involved in the analysis of food for the presence of these compounds, enabling more intense monitoring programs. Following the successful optimisation and validation of the test for milk fat, the bioassay was first used at RIKILT in the food and feed area during the 1998 Brazilian citrus pulp incident. The test procedure was subsequently optimised and validated for animal feed. During the German bakery waste incident in 2003, animal feed was contaminated with dioxins due to the use of waste wood for drying of the material. Besides Germany, the material was also shipped to the Netherlands. Levels up to 12 ng WHO-TEQ/kg were detected, being about 15 times over the current limit of 0. 75 ng WHO-TEQ/kg. A combined strategy of screening with the DR CALUX ® -bioassay and the HRGC/HRMS confirmatory method was used in the Netherlands to rapidly control the incident. Pigs were contaminated by the incident but only to a very limited extent. Despite the rather low limits for pig meat (1 pg WHO-TEQ per g fat), the DR-CALUX ® bioassay, in combination with an extra acid pre-treatment of the fat samples, showed excellent performance, confirming once again the value of this bioassay. Shown during the recent incidents with kaolinic clay (2004) and the contaminated HCl used for gelatine production (2006), the assay is still the best available screening test for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. The second aim of the research in this thesis was to develop, validate and apply a new recombinant yeast screen to detect chemicals with an estrogenic mode of action in animal feed, urine and illegal preparations. A recombinant yeast cell that stably expresses the human estrogen receptor α (hERα) and yeast enhanced green fluorescent protein (yEGFP) as a reporter protein in response to estrogens was developed at the RIKILT. The EC 50 revealed by the RIKILT yeast Estrogen bioAssay (REA) was 0. 5 nM for 17 b-estradiol and was comparable with reported EC 50 values for yeast estrogen bioassays that contain β-galactosidase as a reporter. However, the yEGFP assay can be performed completely in 96 well plates within 4 hours and does not need require cell wall disruption, nor does it need the addition of a substrate. This makes the test sensitive, rapid and convenient with high reproducibility and small variation. The robustness and ease of the yeast cells in combination with the qualities of yEGFP, ensure that the assay will be suited to be used as a high through put system. The properties of the RIKILT yeast Estrogen bioAssay expressing the hERα (REA) were further studied by testing a series of estrogenic compounds. In addition, a similar assay was developed based on the stable expression of human estrogen receptor β (hERβ). When exposed to 17 b-estradiol, the maximum transcriptional activity of the hERb cytosensor was only about 40 % of the activity observed with hERa, but the concentration where half-maximal activation is reached (EC 50), was about 5 times lower. The relative estrogenic potencies (REP), defined as the ratio between the EC 50 of 17 b-estradiol and the EC 50 of the compound, of the synthetic hormones dienestrol, hexestrol and especially mestranol were higher with ERa than with ERβ, while DES was slightly more potent with ERb. The gestagens progesterone and medroxyprogesterone-acetate showed no response, whereas the androgen testosterone showed a very weak response and only at high concentrations. The isoflavones genistein, genistin, daidzein and daidzin, the coumestran coumestrol and the flavonoid naringenin were relatively more potent with ERb than with ERa. Coumestrol and genistein were by far the most potent of these compounds with ERb. However, 8 -prenylnaringenin, a phytoestrogen present in hops, was relatively more potent with ERa than with ERb and was actually the most potent phytoestrogen with ERa. The data demonstrate that the REA shows clear dose-response curves when exposed to estrogenic compounds. Since good dose-response curves can be obtained after only 4 h of exposure, the often questioned permeability of the yeast cell wall does not seem to be an obstacle in our yeast estrogen bioassays. The RIKILT yeast Estrogen bioAssay stably expressing human estrogen receptor α (REA) was validated as a qualitative screening method for the determination of estrogenic activity in calf urine and animal feed. These validations were performed according to EC Decision 2002 / 657, which prescribes the determination of the detection capability (CCb), the specificity and the stability. To determine these performance characteristics, twenty blank urine samples of 19 week old calves were collected and spiked with 17 b-estradiol (E 2 b) at 1 ng/ml- 1, diethylstilbestrol (DES) at 1 ng/ml- 1, 17 a-ethynylestradiol (EE 2) at 1 ngml- 1 a-zearalanol at 50 ngml- 1 or mestranol at 10 ng/ml- 1. Following enzymatic deconjugation and solid phase extraction, 100 ml equivalents of these blank and spiked urine samples were screened for estrogenic activity in a 96 well plate using the REA. All of these blank and low estrogen spiked feed samples fulfilled the CCα and CCβ criterions, meaning that all 20 blank urine samples gave a signal below the determined decision limit CCα and were thus classified as compliant and at least 19 out of the 20 spiked samples gave a signal above this CCα (β= 5 %) and were thus classified as suspect. The specificity of the method was determined with blank urine samples spiked with a high dose of testosterone or progesterone (1000 ng/ml- 1). No response to these substances was detected in the REA. There was also no interference of a high dose of testosterone or progesterone on the response of a low dose of the estrogens. Stability of urine samples was checked with spiked urine samples that were kept frozen for up to 90 days, showing that urine samples could be stored at - 20 °C for up to 60 days without changing the screening result of the assay. The assay was validated for animal feed in a simalar way, using twenty <b>blank</b> animal <b>feed</b> samples, including milk replacers and wet and dry feed samples. As all the performance characteristics met the criteria that were put forward in EC Decision 2002 / 657 for validation of a qualitative screening method, the described clean-up/yeast estrogen bioassay procedures were proven to be valid for the determination of estrogenic activity in calf urine and animal feed. The clean-up procedures for urine and feed samples are relatively simple and the yeast estrogen bioassay, using yEGFP as a reporter protein, is sensitive, rapid, convenient and reproducible. Due to the good sensitivity of the bioassay, only 2 ml of urine or 1 gram of feed were enough to be processed. Combined this resulted in a low cost bioassay that is suited to be used as a high through-put system for the screening of estrogenic activity in calf urine and animal feed. Like the DR CALUX ® assay, Tthe method acquired an ISO 17025 accreditation status in the Netherlands for both of these matrices. The examples of the MPA-incident with wet pig feed and the fish feed, described in Chapter 7 of the thesis, demonstrate the applicability of the bioassay method as an early warning system for pharmaceutical waste and hormone use respectively. This is the first successful example of a developed, validated and applied bioassay for the screening of hormonal substances in feed. At present this method has been in routine use at RIKILT for more than two years. Overall the work presented in this thesis shows that bioassays are valuable tools for rapid and high throughput screening of samples for both known and unknown compounds. As such they may contribute to an earlier detection of new emerging risks and prevent the use of illegal growth-promoting agents with thus far unknown identity...|$|R

40|$|Introduction : Worldwide, Salmonella Typhimurium is the {{predominant}} serovar isolated from slaughter pigs, {{and one of}} the major causes of foodborne salmonellosis in humans (1). Besides Salmonella infections, T- 2 toxin contamination of various feed and food commodities, poses a serious threat to human and animal health (2), especially to pigs which seem {{to be one of the}} most sensitive species to many mycotoxins (3). Moderate to high levels of T- 2 toxin cause feed refusal, vomiting, weight loss, reduced growth, skin lesions and immunosuppression in pigs, resulting in considerable economic losses (4). A strategy for reducing the exposure to mycotoxins is the use of mycotoxin-adsorbing agents in the feed (5). Some of these mycotoxin-adsorbing agents might however affect the pathogenesis of a Salmonella Typhimurium infection. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a modified glucomannan detoxifying agent on the course of a Salmonella Typhimurium infection in T- 2 toxin exposed and unexposed pigs. Materials and methods : An in vivo trial (three-week-old piglets) was performed in which four different pig diets were provided during 23 days: a diet which was free of mycotoxins, a diet containing 1. 0 g of a modified glucomannan binder (Mycosorb®) per kg feed, a diet containing 83 ± 31. 5 µg T- 2 toxin per kg feed and a diet containing 83 ± 31. 5 µg T- 2 toxin per kg feed supplemented with 1. 0 g of the modified glucomannan binder per kg feed. At day 18 of the feeding period, all pigs were inoculated with Salmonella Typhimurium and five days later the pigs were euthanized and organ samples were collected for bacteriological analysis. Furthermore, the binding capacity of the modified glucomannan binder for Salmonella Typhimurium was examined in vitro. For this purpose, Salmonella Typhimurium was added to 1 ml aqua dest whether or not supplemented with 20 mg of the modified glucomannan binder and incubated at 37 °C on a shaker. Immediately and 4 hours after incubation, the number of Salmonella bacteria was assessed by plating 10 -fold dilutions of the solution on Brilliant Green Agar plates. Results : The ingestion of 83 ± 31. 5 µg T- 2 toxin per kg feed by pigs resulted in a significant reduction of weight gain (%) compaired to control pigs that received <b>blank</b> <b>feed.</b> We showed that the addition of the modified glucomannan binder to feed contaminated with 83 µg T- 2 toxin per kg feed, neutralized this reduced weight gain. Supplementation of the feed with T- 2 toxin, the modified glucomannan mycotoxin-adsorbing agent or the combination of both, resulted in a reduced colonization of Salmonella Typhimurium in comparison to control pigs that received <b>blank</b> <b>feed.</b> Furthermore, we showed that after 4 hours, the modified glucomannan binder significantly reduced the number of Salmonella bacteria in aqua dest in comparison to the start of the incubation period and to aqua dest without the modified glucomannan binder. Discussion and conclusions : We highlighted the protective role of the mycotoxin-adsorbing agent tested here, against T- 2 toxin induced weight loss in pigs. We also provided evidence that it captures Salmonella bacteria, resulting in a reduced colonization of the porcine intestine. References : (1) Fisher, I.

During 23 days, they received ad libitum <b>blank</b> <b>feed</b> (control group), feed contaminated with 10 µg/kg T- 2 toxin (10 ppb group) or feed contaminated with 100 µg/kg T- 2 toxin (100 ppb group). The pigs were orally inoculated with 2 x 107 colony forming units (CFU) of Salmonella Typhimurium. Five days after inoculation, the pigs were humanely euthanized and samples of intestinal contents and tissues were taken for bacteriological analysis. Compared to the control group, the 10 ppb and 100 ppb group showed lower numbers of Salmonella Typhimurium in jejunum, cecum (p < 0. 05) and colon tissue, and cecum (p < 0. 05) and colon contents. These results show that the presence of low and in practice relevant concentrations of T- 2 toxin in the feed reduces the colonization of Salmonella Typhimurium in the intestine. 	To elucidate the cause of this reduced colonization, we investigated the effects of T- 2 toxin on the host-pathogen interactions of Salmonella Typhimurium and on the gene expression of the bacterium, in vitro. We showed that very low concentrations of T- 2 toxin (1 - 10 ng/ml) promote the susceptibility of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) and intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J 2) to Salmonella Typhimurium invasion, but not to intracellular proliferation of the bacterium. Furthermore we demonstrated that T- 2 toxin promotes the translocation of Salmonella Typhimurium over an IPEC-J 2 monolayer, at concentrations (1 - 5 ng/ml) that did not exert a notable effect on porcine cell viability and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). These in vitro findings show that T- 2 toxin might result in enhanced colonization of Salmonella Typhimurium in pigs. However, microarray analysis showed that T- 2 toxin, at a concentration as low as 5 ng/ml, reduces expression of Salmonella Typhimurium motility genes flgL, flgM and flgK. It also causes a general downregulation of the metabolism of Salmonella Typhimurium, which could lead to a decreased colonization of the bacterium. Probably, in vivo, T- 2 toxin influences the gene expression of the bacterium before the cell-mediated effect takes place. 	In conclusion, T- 2 toxin significantly affects the gene expression and host-pathogen interactions of Salmonella Typhimurium resulting in a reduced colonization of the bacteria in pigs.

In this frame the EURL-FA has been contacted in June 2013 by an official control laboratory and its related National Reference Laboratory regarding severe technical problems when implementing an official method established by Commission Regulation (EC) No 152 / 2009 [2] for the determination of a specific coccidiostat, diclazuril, authorised as feed additive by the EU legislation [3]. The EURL-FA first conducted a survey among all NRLs for feed additives control & authorisation to gather their experiences with the Community method for the determination of diclazuril at authorised additive level in feed. The information provided by the NRL's hinted at a major flaw in a specific part of the method description of the Commission Regulation. Following the survey and reporting the issue to the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE), it was decided to implement the method described in the Commission Regulation (EC) No 152 / 2009 [2] at the premises of the EURL-FA Control in order to identify the technical reason for this problem. The study performed at the EURL-FA Control confirmed the lack of fitness for purpose reported by the laboratories and due to a significant error in the method description as given in the European Commission Regulation [2]. The method was therefore modified at the EURL-FA Control and the results from the single-laboratory validation of this method showed satisfactory performance characteristics. Moreover, a modification of Commission Regulation (EC) No 152 / 2009 was considered necessary, to remove the error in the corresponding method description. In the 2014 annual workshops (EURL-FA Control and EURL-FA Authorisation) the results of the implementation, optimisation and validation of the method at the EURL-FA were presented to both networks of NRLs and discussion was launched on how to cope with this problem in the best way. As a conclusion, it was decided that the EURL-FA would organise a collaborative study among the NRLs in order to evaluate the fitness for purpose of the optimised method, which corrects the error found in the method description. This collaborative study was conducted in 2015 and the EURL-FA presented the results in the annual workshops of the EURL-FA Authorisation and EURL-FA Control respectively, in November 2015. The main aim of the collaborative study presented here was to assess the method performance characteristics of the corrected method based on high performance liquid chromatography coupled to spectrophotometric detection (LC-UV or LC-DAD) for the determination of diclazuril at additive level in feed. The required target limits of detection and quantification were respectively 0. 1 mg kg- 1 and 0. 5 mg kg- 1. According to the standard operational procedure (SOP) of the corrected method, the test portion, after addition of an internal standard, was extracted with acidified methanol and an aliquot of the extract was purified on a C 18 solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge, containing 5000 mg of the SPE sorbent. Diclazuril was eluted from the cartridge with a mixture of acidified methanol and water. After evaporation, the residue was dissolved in the mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMFA) / water. The content of diclazuril was determined by ternary gradient reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a UV spectrophotometry detector measuring at 280 nm. In total 5 samples corresponding to 4 blind duplicates and 1 <b>blank</b> <b>feed</b> were sent to 15 laboratories and 14 laboratories reported results. Statistical evaluation revealed that the relative standard deviation for repeatability (RSDr) ranged from 4. 5 % to 11. 2 % and the relative standard deviation for reproducibility (RSDR) varied between 14. 3 % and 18. 1 %. The method showed acceptable within-laboratory and between-laboratory precision, since the calculated HORRAT values were in all cases below the critical value of 1. 5. In addition, no false positive was found. Based on the data of the collaborative study and on the discussions, it was concluded during the workshops of 2015 that the EURL-FA will submit to the European Commission a recommendation for the revision of the current Community method. The recommendation will include a proposal for the final text of the method, drafted by the EURL-FA and consolidated after review by the NRLs (Authorisation and Control networks), for its inclusion in the revised Regulation replacing (EC) No 152 / 2009.
