Nesting takes place in colonies of up to 130 pairs from October to March. However, its rate of reproduction is very low as the average number of young reared per adult is 0.2 annually. Despite the lack of breeding success, the resources required for adult survival are abundant and this has resulted in a low adult mortality rate.|$|E

40|$|The Upper Permian in the Netherlands, as {{known from}} {{borehole}} data, is deposited in a mainly evaporitic facies {{north of the}} Brabant and Rhenish Massifs. In the extreme south (Belgian Campine, de Peel) a near-shore facies of reef dolomites and elastics occurs. In the western and central Netherlands the Upper Permian is represented by a thin sequence of anhydrite and dolomite with some elastics (anhydrite facies). The rock salt facies, developed in the northeastern part of the country, is subdivided into 4 evaporation cycles.

The depositional rhythm of the deposits in the rock salt facies is caused by periodic northward shifts of the area of greatest subsidence. Owing to tectonic movements, initiating these shifts, changes occurred in the physiographic conditions relating to entrance channel and basin causing the basin salinity to decrease. Only during periods of relatively low salinity did euxinic conditions exist which gave rise to bituminous deposits. From the distribution of dolomites and bituminous deposits the presence of an east-west striking swell, the Cocvorden Swell, has been inferred, showing that this was a higher and more slowly subsiding tract in the Upper Permian basin.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{quantify}} the prevalence and distress of taste loss at different intervals after radiotherapy (RT) for {{head and neck}} cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In four different groups of head and neck cancer patients (73 patients in total), taste loss and distress due to taste loss were evaluated by taste acuity tests and taste questionnaires. Group 1 (n= 17) was analyzed prior to RT. Groups 2 (n= 17), 3 (n= 17) and 4 (n= 22) were at 2, 6 and 12 - 24 months after treatment, respectively. A cross-sectional analysis was performed between these four groups. RESULTS: Prior to initiation of RT (group 1), partial taste loss was observed in 35, 18 and 6 % of patients for <b>bitter,</b> <b>salt</b> and sweet, respectively. At 2 months after RT (group 2), taste loss (partial or total) was seen in 88, 82, 76 and 53 % for <b>bitter,</b> <b>salt,</b> sweet and sour, respectively. At 6 months (group 3), partial taste loss was seen in 71, 65, 41 and 41 % (<b>bitter,</b> <b>salt,</b> sweet, sour) and after 1 - 2 years (group 4) in 41, 50, 27 and 27 % (<b>bitter,</b> <b>salt,</b> sweet, sour).

Here we investigate mechanisms underlying acid detection in Drosophila and report that the fly displays strong taste aversion to common carboxylic acids. We find that acid tastants act by the activation of a subset of bitter neurons and inhibition of sweet neurons. Bitter neurons begin to respond at pH 5 and show an increase in spike frequency as the extracellular pH drops, which does not rely on previously identified chemoreceptors. Notably, sweet neuron activity depends on the balance of sugar and acid tastant concentrations. This is independent of bitter neuron firing, and allows the fly to avoid acid-laced food sources {{even in the absence}} of functional bitter neurons. The two mechanisms may allow the fly to better evaluate the risk of ingesting acidic foods and modulate its feeding decisions accordingly...|$|R

Ir 76 b mutants have reduced responses to amino acids, which are rescued by transgenic expression of Ir 76 b and a mosquito ortholog AgIr 76 b. Co-expression of Ir 20 a with Ir 76 b is sufficient for conferring amino acid responses in sweet-taste neurons. Notably, Ir 20 a also serves to block salt response of Ir 76 b.

40|$|Taste is {{the primary}} sensory system for {{detecting}} food quality and palatability. Drosophila detects five distinct taste modalities that include sweet, <b>bitter,</b> <b>salt,</b> water, and the taste of carbonation. Of these, sweet-sensing neurons appear to have utility {{for the detection of}} nutritionally rich food while bitter-sensing neurons signal toxicity and confer repulsion. Growing evidence in mammals suggests that taste for fatty acids (FAs) signals the presence of dietary lipids and promotes feeding. While flies appear to be attracted to fatty acids, the neural basis for fatty acid detection and attraction are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a range of FAs are detected by the fly gustatory system and elicit a robust feeding response. Flies lacking olfactory organs respond robustly to FAs, confirming that FA attraction is mediated through the gustatory system. Furthermore, flies detect FAs independent of pH, suggesting the molecular basis for FA taste is not due to acidity. We show that low and medium concentrations of FAs serve as an appetitive signal and they are detected exclusively through the same subset of neurons that sense appetitive sweet substances, including most sugars. In mammals, taste perception of sweet and bitter substances is dependent on phospholipase C (PLC) signaling in specialized taste buds. We find that flies mutant for norpA, a Drosophila ortholog of PLC, fail to respond to FAs. Intriguingly, norpA mutants respond normally to other tastants, including sucrose and yeast. The defect of norpA mutants can be rescued by selectively restoring norpA expression in sweet-sensing neurons, corroborating that FAs signal through sweet-sensing neurons, and suggesting PLC signaling in the gustatory system is specifically involved in FA taste. Taken together, these findings reveal that PLC function in Drosophila sweet-sensing neurons is a conserved molecular signaling pathway that confers attraction to fatty acids...|$|E

Understanding how the sensory {{information}} is being processed in the ¨brain and generates behaviors {{is one of}} the great est challenges of science in our century. Ac tivity of single neurons have been investigated in ¨great detail. However, neurons do not work in iso lation. They are organized in circuits that proces s key information to perform higher brain fun ctions. In order to understand these brain ci rcuits the use of functional imaging has been ¨established as an excellent tool for monitoring n etwork activity with high spatial and tempora l resolution. Therefore, during the first par t of my thesis, I developed a framework of al gorithms to extract relevant information from func tional imaging in order to understand the activity ¨of thousands of neurons. The second a im of this thesis is to study neuronal coding, how ¨neurons process sensory information and react to¨ external stimuli. As means to achieve that aim, I¨ selected to study the gustatory system, a well-def ined and simple sensory system which coding strate gies are still a matter of debate. In order¨ to study the neural mechanisms inherent to gustato ry information processing, I focused on the brains tem, the first relay of taste processing in the ce ntral nervous system. Brainstem circuits are a ver y attractive system for studying the basic computa tions underlying simple reflex motor outputs. More over, in the particular organization of the zebraf ish, this circuits are rather accessible. My ¨results showed that taste categories (sweet, sour, <b>bitter,</b> <b>salt</b> and umami) are represented by dissi milar brainstem responses and generate different b ehaviors. I also showed that the intensity percept ion of different categories is encoded by differen t principles. On the other hand, the food we ¨consume is a combination of different tastants fr om different categories. Then, how does the b rainstem cope with such mixtures? I observed that¨ taste mixtures generates nonlinearities in th e activity of the brainstem circuits that may suggest the presence of complex coding mechanisms such as dynamic gain modulation and neural a ttractors. These mechanisms might be used for a be tter food detection or more efficient rejecti on of inedible substances.

40|$|Flavors {{of taste}} are {{detected}} {{by a set}} of microscopical cellular aggregates calledthe taste buds, present in different arrangements on the upper surface of the tongueand other areas in the mouth. Taste buds are chemosensors that can detect differenttaste qualities such as sweet, sour, <b>bitter,</b> <b>salt</b> and umami. Information from thetaste buds is carried via nerve fibers to the brain where these signals are furtherprocessed, finally leading to the experience of taste. Taste buds not only help usenjoy food, they are also part of an important control and warning system, enablingus to avoid consuming hazardous substances or spoiled food. During the past severalyears, more light has been shed on many aspects of the gustatory system, includingthe local epithelial origin of taste buds and taste transduction mechanisms. However,the manner in which taste buds develop and become connected to the brain by nervefibers has long been a matter of debate. The present work now demonstrates the crucialimportance of two proteins closely related to nerve growth factor (NGF) in tastebud development and proper taste and sensory functions of the mouth. Messenger RNAcoding for the NGF-related proteins BDNF (brain derived neuro trophic factor) andNT- 3 (neurotrophin- 3) were found to be present in precisely the right locations inand around the taste buds to suggest that they are of vital importance for controllingthe arrival of nerve fibers to these structures. These hypotheses were borneout bystudies of mice in which either the gene for BDNF or NT- 3 had been selectively turnedoff. Mice that developed without BDNF had very few and abnormal taste buds and wereunable to discriminate between primary tastes such as sweet, salt or bitter. Animalsin which the NT- 3 gene had instead been turned off appeared to have a normal developmentof their taste bud system, but instead demon strated severe impairment of sensoryfunction of mucous membranes of the oral cavity. These results demonstrate key roles for the two neurotrophic proteins BDNF andNT- 3 in con trolling the development of the gustatory and somatosensory apparatusesof the mouth. These neurotrophins also seem to be important in oral gustatory andsomatosensory innervation in humans. It {{remains to be seen whether}} or not disturbancesof the genes for these neurotrophic proteins might underlie rare human conditionssuch as familial dysautonomia in which the ability to discriminate tastes is lost. These novel findings may also have implications in more common cases in problemsof loss of taste and sensation in the mouth such as those seen after injury to thenerves, either by accident or following oral or facial surgery. Knowledge about whichproteins are needed to stimulate nerve fibers to grow into mucous membranes of theoral cavity during development suggests that these same proteins might become helpfulin stimulating regeneration of injured nerves in adult patients, perhaps helpingthem to regain lost taste and sensory function. Neurotrophins are also expressed in the developing teeth. They all show temporospatiallyspecific expression patterns. We suggest that neurotrophins are involved in earlymorphogenetic events during tooth development and that NGF and BDNF are involvedin the innervation of the dental pulp. Further experiments are required to determinethe precise roles of neurotrophins in tooth development. The GDNF family of ligands and receptors are also expressed in developing tongueand teeth. They might be involved in the autonomic innervation ot the tongue. Inteeth, they might partici pate both in morphogenetic events during tooth developmentand participate in tooth innervation.

5000|$|Chinese pickles {{all need}} to balance the flavors of sweet, sour, pungent, <b>salt,</b> <b>bitter</b> and savory. There are also spicy pickles with floral notes, such as the Szechuan pepper. However, most Chinese pickles still aim for {{a balance between the}} tastes of vinegar, salt, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, hot chili, sugar, and the {{vegetable}} or fruit itself.Most pickles need to wait for a few months for the vegetables and fruit to ferment. There are also [...] "quickles"—a portmanteau of [...] "quick" [...] and [...] "pickles"—that people can eat them after a few hours or a few days. Cucumber pickles, for example, may be eaten after they have been pickled in a jar for three hours.|$|R
40|$|Investigations of the {{relations}} between taste perception and obesity have concentrated largely on sweet and bitter tastes, with little work on the “savory ” tastes—salt and glutamate—and very little work on sour taste. This article briefly reviews current understanding of {{the relations}} between the ability to taste different tastes, (ie, taste thresh-old for sweet, <b>bitter,</b> sour, <b>salt,</b> and umami) and body mass. Obese children and adolescents show a disturbance in some tastes, with reported reductions in sweet and salt thresholds. Observations on relations between sweet taste threshold and obesity are contradictory; literature discrepancies may depend on the techniques used to eval-uate taste. Obese women, however, report higher intensities of mono-sodium glutamate perception. Taste thresholds have been reported to be raised (bitter and sour), lowered (salt), or unchanged (sweet) in obese adults. Taste perceptual changes (threshold, intensity) in obe-sity are complex and may be different in obese men and women and in adults and children. Very little is currently known about {{the relations between}} savory tastes—salt and umami—and body weight, and these areas merit further study. Am J Clin Nutr 2009; 90 (suppl) : 1 S– 4 S...|$|R
