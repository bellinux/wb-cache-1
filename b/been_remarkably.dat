5|$|Berger had <b>been</b> <b>remarkably</b> successful, {{despite the}} {{obstacles}} placed {{in his path}} by the Wehrmacht, having recruited nearly 60,000 men for the Waffen-SS between mid-January {{and the end of}} June. These fresh troops were more than sufficient to replace those released when Himmler demobilised several categories of SS reservists in late July. But Himmler knew that the future of the Waffen-SS was assured; Hitler was already considering invading the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|By 1975, {{peregrine}} falcons {{had been}} reduced to 324 pairs in North America, primarily as a result of DDT, a widely used pesticide. DDT lowered estrogen levels in female peregrines and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to thin and break during incubation. Recovery efforts for the peregrine falcon have <b>been</b> <b>remarkably</b> successful: agricultural DDT was banned by the U.S. in 1972 and efforts to breed and train peregrine falcons in captivity to later release to the wild were effective. In 1999, the peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E

5|$|Robin Friday and {{his twin}} brother, Tony, {{were born in}} Acton, west London, on 27 July 1952. Their parents, Alf Friday, a driver for a laundry firm, and his wife Sheila, were both born in Acton and had married a year before, both aged 20, having met three years earlier. Sheila's father, Frederick Riding, had played {{professional}} football for Brentford before the Second World War. The Fridays lived with Sheila's family until moving into a prefab of their own in Acton Green when Robin and Tony were aged two; they moved to a maisonette in South Acton in 1962 when {{it was found that}} the prefab was sinking. Robin and Tony were later described by their mother as having <b>been</b> <b>remarkably</b> close, rarely arguing or fighting. A noticeable difference in personality was that Robin was shy, whereas Tony was more confident. The twins attended their first professional match at the age of two, when their father took them to a Brentford match at Griffin Park. From the age of four Alf took both boys to play football at a local park every afternoon.|$|E
25|$|However, while Rousseau's {{initial impact}} {{encouraged}} bloody revolutions against traditional politics, including both the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution, his own {{conclusions about the}} best forms of community seem to have <b>been</b> <b>remarkably</b> classical, in favor of city-states such as Geneva, and rural living.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} some {{skepticism}} (most notably from Arthur Phillips himself), it would have <b>been</b> <b>remarkably</b> difficult for A.E.H. Phillips to have constructed a forgery to fool all modern forensic evidence and Shakespeare scholars, especially given the quarto would necessarily have to predate much of the technology and research used to check its authenticity. Even though Phillips claims that the play {{is the work of}} his father, most Shakespeare scholars have discounted his theory. The only copy of the 1594 quarto of Titus Andronicus was discovered in an attic in Sweden in 1904, and so the bizarre means by which Arthur has been lost for centuries seem relatively plausible.|$|E

25|$|With the Jewish penchant to {{be drawn}} to white collar {{professional}} jobs and having excelled at intellectual pursuits, many Jews have also become <b>been</b> <b>remarkably</b> successful as an entrepreneurial and professional minority in the United States. Jewish culture has a strong tradition, emphasis and respect for money and a deep emphasis on financial acumen, business shrewdness, and entrepreneurial savvy have resulted in many Jews starting their own businesses that have become major economic growth engines that shape much of the U.S. economy. Many Jewish family businesses that are passed down {{from one generation to}} the next serve as an asset, source of income and layer a strong financial groundwork for the family's overall socioeconomic prosperity. Within the Jewish American cultural sphere, Jewish Americans have also developed a strong culture of entrepreneurship as excellence in entrepreneurship and engagement in business and commerce is highly prized in Jewish culture.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, Chartres' windows have <b>been</b> <b>remarkably</b> fortunate. The medieval glass largely escaped harm {{during the}} Huguenot iconoclasm and the {{religious}} wars of the 16th century although the west rose sustained damage from artillery fire in 1591. The relative darkness of the interior {{seems to have been}} a problem for some. A few windows were replaced with much lighter grisaille glass in the 14th century to improve illumination, particularly on the north side and several more were replaced with clear glass in 1753 as part of the reforms to liturgical practice that also led to the removal of the jubé. The installation of the Vendôme Chapel between two buttresses of the nave in the early 15th century resulted in the loss of one more lancet window, though it did allow for the insertion of a fine late-gothic window with donor portraits of Louis de Bourbon and his family witnessing the Coronation of the Virgin with assorted saints.|$|E

According to Simon Goldhill, [...] "The Athenian court seems to have <b>been</b> <b>remarkably</b> unwilling to allow any female presence in the civic space of the law court itself". [...] Metic women, however, apparently could appear in court cases on their own behalf, and could initiate legal action.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{began the}} {{preceding}} season as league champions; a win against Blackburn Rovers in August 2004 ensured they eclipsed Nottingham Forest's record of 42 league matches unbeaten. The run extended to six more matches, before losing 2–0 to Manchester United at Old Trafford on 24 October 2004. Poor form throughout November allowed league leaders Chelsea {{to extend the}} gap at the top; Wenger conceded retaining the title in April 2005, calling his opponents [...] "worthy champions ... they have <b>been</b> <b>remarkably</b> consistent." [...] A run of twelve league matches unbeaten, culminating in a 7–0 home win against Everton helped Arsenal finish in second place. In spite of exiting the Champions League to Bayern Munich in the second round, the team won the 2005 FA Cup Final against Manchester United – winning 5–4 on penalties after a goalless draw.|$|E
500|$|With Chelsea {{unable to}} garner maximum points in their next two matches, Arsenal knew before their game away at Tottenham that a draw would {{guarantee}} {{their status as}} champions. Cole returned for the derby, after sitting out the Leeds match with an ankle injury. Arsenal took an early lead when Vieira finished off a counter-attacking move. Incisive football brought about the second goal, ten minutes before the break. Bergkamp passed the ball to Vieira, who cut it back for Pirès to sidefoot. Tottenham replied {{in the second half}} by scoring twice – the equaliser a penalty – but it did not stop the Arsenal players celebrating at the final whistle [...] "in front of their supporters' White Hart Lane enclave". This marked the second time the club had been crowned league champions at their rivals' ground: the first time had been in 1971. Wenger praised his team for their success, telling the BBC: [...] "We've <b>been</b> <b>remarkably</b> consistent, haven't lost a game and we have played stylish football. We have entertained people who just love football." ...|$|E

500|$|When Chotiner {{appeared}} before the subcommittee on May 2, he testified {{that he had been}} retained by the firm when it was seeking to expand to California, that he had conferred with Justice Department attorneys regarding the criminal charges, and that no special favors had been asked or given. Under questioning by subcommittee counsel Robert F. Kennedy, the younger brother of committee member and future president John F. Kennedy, Chotiner also disclosed that he had been retained by New Jersey mobster Marco Regnelli in an attempt to stave off a deportation order. He testified that he never discussed his clients with Nixon, and had not used the Vice President's offices for business purposes. In a press release, Chotiner fired back at Kennedy, suggesting that he had been subpoenaed for political reasons. Denying any influence peddling, Chotiner asked whether the subcommittee counsel could [...] "explain whether any influence was used in connection with his own appointment as attorney for a subcommittee of a committee of which his brother... is a member." [...] Patrick Murphy Malin, head of the American Civil Liberties Union concurred that requiring Chotiner to testify had [...] "overtones of political harassment." [...] Time magazine summed up the hearings, [...] "At week's end two points were clear: 1) Murray Chotiner had been sought out by, and had gone to work for, unsavory clients who obviously regarded him as a man of influence; and 2) on the basis of evidence so far adduced, he had <b>been</b> <b>remarkably</b> unsuccessful in wielding any." ...|$|E

Some of these claims have <b>been</b> <b>remarkably</b> successful, culminating either directly in court judgements or indirectly in legislative settlements.|$|E
