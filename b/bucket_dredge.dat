Both continuous sounds, {{such as those}} produced by propellers, pumps, and generators, and repetitive sounds produced by particular dredging events (e. g., <b>dredge</b> <b>bucket</b> striking the channel bottom, jaws of bucket clamping shut) are potential sources of underwater noise. This note examines the intensity, periodicity, and attenuation of emitted sounds from <b>bucket</b> <b>dredging</b> operations {{and how they are}} influenced by factors including substrate type, hydrodynamic conditions, equipment maintenance, and skill of the dredge plant operator. BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION: In recent years concerns have been raised regarding underwater sounds of anthropogenic origin and their potential impacts on aquatic organisms. Although not the most frequently cited concern, noise-related disturbance has occasionally been cited as justification for environmental windows for Federal navigation dredging projects in both marine and freshwater systems (Reine, Dickerson, and Clarke 1998). Hypothetically, underwater sound...|$|R

A Semisubmersible-type <b>bucket</b> ladder <b>dredge</b> is a possible candidate to satisfy the need of PT Timah (Indonesia tin mining company) to exploit tin deposits in water depths of 50 m and deeper. The existing vessel used by PT Timah, barge- type <b>bucket</b> ladder <b>dredge,</b> is only capable of operating in depths shallower than 30 m. In order to evaluate the dredging capability in 50 m water depth, a dynamic analysis of both semisubmersible-type and barge-type <b>bucket</b> ladder <b>dredges</b> was conducted. The proposed vessel, a semisubmersible-type, was designed by modifying an existing semisubmersible platform used in the oil and gas industry, while the barge-type used is from a conventional <b>bucket</b> ladder <b>dredge.</b> Hydrodynamic coefficients and response amplitude operators (RAOS) of both vessels were computed by using WAMIT (Wave Analysis MIT) software and AutoCAD RI") was used for design purposes. The response spectra of the vessels were obtained in head, quarter, and beam seas of sea state 4. The effect of mooring stiffness is also presented. Besides modeling the system with low stiffness, such as a catenary mooring, the dynamic analysis was also conducted for the free-floating condition. Finally, the motion performance between the two vessels was compared for various sea conditions, and it is shown that the semisubmersible-type <b>bucket</b> ladder <b>dredge</b> performs better with smaller responses in the selected sea conditions expected in deeper water depths (> 50 M) ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: This note {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} research into the potential for dissolved oxygen (DO) reduction associated with dredging operations. Efforts toward development of a simple computational model for predicting the degree of dredge-induced DO reduction are described along with results of a monitoring program around a <b>bucket</b> <b>dredge</b> operation. BACKGROUND: The biological impact of dredge-induced DO reduction is sometimes cited as a concern by resource management agencies, {{as was the case}} with fishery resource managers presented with a proposal to dredge the Haverstraw Bay portion of the Hudson River Estuary from August through October 1987. Haverstraw Bay is a shallow (2. 5 to 3. 0 m), wide (5 km) reach of the Hudson River and is an important nursery area for several species of anadromous fishes, including striped bass, Morone saxatilis, the juveniles of which congregate in the shoals during late summer-early fall. The New York District and the US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station responded to the concern by constructing and applying two simple computational models for predicting the effect of a dredging operation on DO concentrations. A monitoring study was designed and conducted to measure actual dredge-induced DO reduction in Haverstraw Bay and compare these values to those predicted by the models (Lunz, LaSalle, and Houston 1988).

5000|$|Brief History of the Jack Wade Creek Mine: Because of {{questions}} as to whether claims were in Canada or Alaska, many miners filed claim locations in both Dawson City, Yukon Territory and Eagle, Alaska. Jack Wade Creek's first claims were located in 1892, and have been worked continuously ever since. The creek was named for Jack Anderson and Wade Nelson, the original locators. In 1936, the <b>bucket</b> line <b>dredge</b> working at Franklin was bought, dismantled and hauled by horses over the ice to Jack Wade Creek by the Yukon Placer Mining Co., which owned the claims. In 1938, Fred Whitehead had the contract to build the small airstrip at Jack Wade Creek, and the airstrip for Franklin, on the ridge between Franklin and Jack Wade. George Robinson {{went to work for}} [...] "the Company" [...] on Jack Wade in 1932, went to war in 1941 and returned to the creek in 1949. In 1951, George bought Jack Wade from the Company, mining on his own, until the early 1970s when his health forced him to slow down. George died in 1989 at the age of 83. He lived in a log cabin built around the start of the 20th century and told stories of the old miners, good and bad season, of walking to Dawson for a few days of cards and girls, of the big nuggets; 25, 33, 56 & 70 ounces that the creek has given up. His lifestyle hadn't changed much since he first came to the creek 55 years ago. In 1986, Bureau of Land Management told George his claims were no longer valid, and the Sierra Club has a court order closing down 85% of the mining in Alaska {{at the end of the}} 1987 season, which not only ended George's income, but put an end to his lifestyle that had not changed in over 100 years. But George Robinson pleaded his case in court, and got his claims back.|$|R
40|$|Clamshell dredges {{are used}} around the United States for both navigational and {{environmental}} dredging projects. Clamshell dredges are extremely mobile and can excavate sediment {{over a wide}} range of depths. The object of this thesis is to develop a methodology for production and cost estimation for clamshell dredge projects. There are current methods of predicting clamshell dredge production which rely on production curves and constant cycle times. This thesis calculates production estimation by predicting cycle time which is the time required to complete one dredge cycle. By varying the cycle time according to site characteristics production can be predicted. A second important component to predicting clamshell <b>dredge</b> production is <b>bucket</b> fill factor. This is the percent of the bucket that will fill with sediment {{depending on the type of}} soil being excavated. Using cycle time as the basis for production calculation a spreadsheet has been created to simplify the calculation of production and project cost. The production calculation also factors in soil type and region of the United States. The spreadsheet is capable of operating with basic site characteristics, or with details about the <b>dredge,</b> <b>bucket</b> size, and region. Once the production is calculated the project cost can be determined. First the project length is found by dividing the total amount of sediment that is to be excavated by the production rate. Once the project length is calculated the remainder of the project cost can be found. The methods discussed in this thesis were used to calculate project cost for 5 different projects. The results were then compared to estimates by the government and the actual cost of the project. The government estimates were an average of 39 % higher than the actual project cost. The method discussed in this thesis was only 6 % higher than the actual cost...|$|R

The results of research carried out, mostly relates {{to the use of}} clamshells in dry bulk materials. While good prediction of the forces (in dry materials) involved are possible by measuring the closing curve, the very prediction of the closing curve of clamshells in general, seems to be problematic. Because the dredging business is concerned with water-saturated sand or clay has to be dredged, the research into the closing process of clamshell grabs had to start from scratch (except for the kinematics of clamshells). In 1989 the research carried out by Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company resulted in a numerical method of calculating the closing process of clamshell grabs in water saturated sand and clay, which simulates the closing of a clamshell so that production and forces can be predicted. The calculation method is based on the non-linear equations of motion of the buckets and the sand cutting theory Miedema presented at WODCON XII. A clay cutting theory is implemented in the numerical model but will not be taken into consideration in this paper. In 1991, Great Lakes and the Delft University of Technology carried out laboratory research in which a scale model clamshell was used. This research, carried out in dry and in water saturated sand, resulted in a verification and validation of the calculation method with respect to the closing curve, the angular velocity and the pulling force in the closing wire.
