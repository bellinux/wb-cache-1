50|$|The site is <b>broadleaved</b> <b>oak</b> {{woodland}} {{on north}} Buckinghamshire clay, with an understorey of hazel and blackthorn. Herbs include primrose and wood anemone, and small streams and wide rides provide additional habitats. The woods have 35 butterfly species, including the rare black hairstreak. There were five species of fritillary, but some {{have not been}} seen since the late 1970s. Breeding birds include nightingales.|$|E
50|$|The wood is {{a mixture}} of {{conifers}} and <b>broadleaves,</b> such as <b>oak,</b> beech and sycamore. The latter mostly date from the 1930s, while the conifers have been planted more recently.|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{explicit}} knowledge {{regarding the}} quantity and the spatial distribution of forest parameters is crucial for sustainable forest management, {{as well as in}} fulfilling national reporting needs in the framework of international treaties (i. e. Kyoto Protocol, FAO, EFFIS etc). Especially, tree number which can be used for assessing forest tree density (tree number/ha), is among the most important and laboursome parameters to be measured in the field. The aim {{of this study is to}} estimate tree number based on the use of nationwide, freely available, very high spatial resolution orthophotos acquired from Greek National Cadastre and Mapping Agency during the 2007 - 2009 period. The study area is the University Forest of Taxiarchis, which is located in central Halkidiki, Northern Greece. The dominant species of the forest includes both <b>broadleaves</b> (<b>oak,</b> beech) and coniferous species (Black pine, Calabrian pine), which are found in both pure and mixed stands. Tree crown detection was tested on natural color orthophoto bands in several plots. The principal components and intensity-hue-saturation transformations were also applied in order to enhance tree detection accuracy. Local maxima technique was utilized for tree crown detection. Accuracy results were evaluated based on field plot data available from the official forest management plan of the area completed in 2011. Overall, the detection accuracy exceeded 50 % which is deemed satisfactory considering also the heterogeneity of the Mediterranean landscape and the limited spectral resolution of the remote sensing data available...|$|R
5000|$|The {{woodlands}} {{are predominantly}} mixed <b>broadleaves</b> mainly containing <b>oak</b> and sycamore, with the understories consisting of rowan, hazel, holly and guelder rose. Small pockets of heather {{can also be}} found. These woodlands provide considerable colour and diversity to this suburban and formerly industrial area and are currently managed to ensure a continuity of multi-aged tree cover. Great Hawksworth has received active management in recent years through the removal of invasive tree species {{and the promotion of}} understorey and ground flora.|$|R
30|$|Seven {{land use}} {{categories}} were identified namely, chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) forest, broadleaved forest, bamboo (Dendrocalamus strictus) forest, ban oak (Quercus leucotrichophora) forest, khair (Acacia catechu) forest, culturable blank and cultivation. The area under chir pine, cultivation and khair forests increased by 191  ha (4.55  %), 129  ha (13.81  %) and 77  ha (23.40  %), whereas the area under ban <b>oak,</b> <b>broadleaved,</b> culturable blank and bamboo decreased by 181  ha (16.58  %), 152  ha (6.30  %), 71  ha (2.72  %) and 7  ha (0.47  %), respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{forests in}} the {{national}} park, which exhibit the characteristics of European-Siberian vegetation, cover an area of 933 ha. Dominant species include coniferous trees such as Scots pine (65%), larch (24%) and fir (6%). Other notable trees include <b>broadleaves</b> such as <b>oak</b> (5%), alder, aspen (Populus tremuloides), maple, dogwood (Cornus) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). Wild strawberry (Fragaria), wild rose (Rosa canina), wild pear (Pyrus communis), dwarf juniper (Juniperus pseudosabina), wild hazelnut and hawthorn (Crataegus) are common forms of low vegetation (shrubs and herbaceous plants).|$|R
40|$|The authors {{deal with}} the problem of the re-naturalization of afforestations of Black pine in the Apennines (Central Italy). Gap-cutting of two {{different}} sizes (the gap diameter/stand height ratios were respectively 0. 75 and 1. 0) on age classes stands (respectively 50 and 90 years old) have been carried out. The results of the dynamics of the tree regeneration established in the gaps 7 years after the beginning of the experiment are given. The Black pine represents the best regenerated tree species and its presence is increasing. Some <b>broadleaves,</b> Pubescent <b>oak</b> (Quercus pubescens Willd.) and Holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) particularly, and Hop-hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia Scop.) and Manna-ash (Fraxinus ornus L.) on a subordinate way, are also present in the gaps. These results confirm that the gap-cutting system represents an effective instrument for the natural regeneration priming and a low impact environmental treatment which is particularly fit for the re-naturalization of the conifers&# 8217; monocultures. According to this experience the gaps&# 8217; optimal sizes are 150 - 250 m 2. These gaps should be distributed appropriately in space and time...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{expansion}} {{increases the}} need for, and pressure on, green areas. Reforestation {{projects in the}} rural–urban fringe represent an opportunity for enhancing the environmental quality of peri-urban spaces and a means to contribute to cities carbon neutrality policies. Yet, relatively little information exists regarding the long term (10 – 25 years) survival and growth rate in urban and peri-urban plantations. This paper reports and discusses the results achieved by a reforestation in the peri-urban space of Rome (Italy), 25 years after its establishment. The plantation has been periodically surveyed between 6 and 24 years of age by means of continuous inventories, {{with the aim of}} monitoring growth dynamics. Permanent sample plots have been investigated and stratified by tree species composition (broadleaves vs. conifers, single vs. multispecies) for data analysis. On the whole, plantations show suitable results in terms of rate of growth, carbon storage and uptake, especially in coniferous and mixed stands. The average stand volume of the forest plantation, currently ranges from one-and-a third to one-and-a-half times the average values estimated for natural high forest stands of the same age and species groups at country level. The species groups exhibit differential growth patterns over the observed period, that are mainly due to differences in the ecological traits of the planted trees. Ten years after the establishment, the average annual value of carbon uptake in conifer and mixed species group exceeds 10 Mg CO 2 equivalent ha- 1 year- 1, a figure corresponding to 4 times the value of deciduous <b>broadleaves</b> (<b>oaks</b> and other species) and 1. 5 times the value of evergreen oaks. Twenty years after the establishment, the average annual carbon uptake peaks to 25 Mg CO 2 equivalent ha- 1 year- 1 in the mixed species group, exceeds 15 Mg CO 2 equivalent ha- 1 year- 1 in the conifers, and ranks between 6 and 12. 5 Mg CO 2 equivalent ha- 1 year- 1 in the groups dominated by broadleaved species. Overall with a surface area just under 300 ha, the carbon uptake level of the Castel di Guido reforestation allows to offset the 0. 04 % of CO 2 emissions of the city of Rome. Although the spatial coexistence of even-aged plantation blocks characterized by a range of ecological traits, is expected to ensure a more continuous carbon sequestration, being less susceptible to damage of any kind, the current lack of silvicultural management may also lead to degradation processes, by triggering e. g. fuel accumulation and, by consequence, forest fires. In this line, recommendations are provided in order to improve the ecological and functional efficiency of the investigated reforestation. The field experiment demonstrates, ultimately, the capability of the continuous forest inventory to take the pulse over several decades of tree species performance and carbon uptake levels in urban and peri-urban reforestations...|$|R
30|$|The study {{revealed}} {{a decrease in}} the area under forest and culturable blank categories and a simultaneous increase in the area under cultivation primarily due to the large scale introduction of horticultural cash crops in the state. The composition of forests also exhibited some major changes, with an increase in the area of commercially important monoculture plantation species such as pine and khair, and a decline in the area of <b>oak,</b> <b>broadleaved</b> and bamboo which are facing a high anthropogenic pressure in meeting the livelihood demands of forest dependent communities. In time deforestation, forest degradation and ecological imbalances due to the changing forest species composition may inflict irreversible damages upon unstable and fragile mountain zones such as the Indian Himalayas. The associated common property externalities involved at local, regional and global scales, necessitate the monitoring of land use dynamics across forested landscapes in developing future strategies and policies concerning agricultural diversification, natural forest conservation and monoculture tree plantations.|$|R
5000|$|Marsh tits breed {{mostly in}} lowland areas, but can reach altitudes {{of up to}} 1,300 m. They prefer large areas of moist, <b>broadleaved</b> woodland, often <b>oak</b> or beech, though they can occupy wet alder woodland, {{riverside}} trees, parks and gardens or orchards. A study at Monks Wood, Cambridgeshire, England, found that marsh tits required mature trees with a shrub layer below the canopy, but that they avoided parts of the wood with lots of young trees. Another study in the United Kingdom found that during winter and while foraging, marsh tits spent more time than blue tits in the wood's understorey, and more time lower in the woodland canopy and understorey. Trees and shrubs in 10 breeding territories were also compared. The trees varied significantly between territories, but the shrub characteristics did not, suggesting that the shrubs were {{more important to the}} birds. In Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, marsh tits were [...] "largely absent" [...] from parts of the wood with a dense canopy but poor shrub cover.|$|R
25|$|A {{continuous}} area {{of approximately}} 400 hectares (988 acres) {{is covered with}} woodland or plantation. The forest is managed for timber by United Utilities, using a continuous cover policy (rather than clear felling and restocking). Macclesfield Borough Council plans to increase {{the area of the}} former royal forest that is covered by woodland. The predominant species are Sitka spruce and Japanese Larch, with some Scots Pine, Lodgepole Pine, Corsican pine and Norway Spruce. There are also areas of semi-natural mixed and <b>broadleaved</b> woodland, mainly <b>oak,</b> sycamore and beech; in 2004, broadleaved species made up 23% of the total, although current forestry management aims to increase the proportion. The woodland supports mosses and thirty species of fungi, including fly agaric, stinkhorns, honey fungus and the sickener. The area also includes areas of acidic unimproved upland grassland, including approximately a hectare within the Trentabank nature reserve; this supports species including bluebell, tormentil, pignut, birdsfoot trefoil, foxglove and lesser knapweed, while the reservoir margins support aquatic plants including amphibious bistort, water mint, Water Horsetail and common spikerush.|$|R
40|$|Mediterranean forest {{plantations}} are currently under an intense debate {{related to their}} ecological function, sustainability and future performance. In several Mediterranean countries, efforts are directed to convert pine plantations into mixed and more diverse forests. This research aims to evaluate {{the effect of the}} spatial configuration of pine plantations on regeneration and plant diversity in order to facilitate plantation management towards more diversified stands. Spatial characteristics of plantations (proximity to different vegetation types, fragmentation and internal patch structure) were related to abundance of seedlings of an ecologically important <b>broadleaved</b> species, Holm <b>Oak</b> (Quercus ilex L.), and the Shannon diversity index of the community. Q. ilex seedling abundance and plant diversity in pine plantation patches are favoured by the proximity to oak patches located uphill. Fragmentation affected only plant diversity, with smaller patches having more diversity. The internal structure of the pine patch influenced both regeneration of Q. ilex and diversity. Pine patches with lower pine tree density were characterized by higher diversity and less Q. ilex regeneration confirming that internal structure affects species differently. From a management perspective, the process of conversion of Mediterranean pine plantations to mixed oak–pine forests could be facilitated by (1) having the seed source uphill from the plantation, (2) increasing the fragmentation of plantations and (3) promoting the interna...|$|R
30|$|Within {{the forest}} land use category, chirpine and khair showed an {{increase}} in area, while ban <b>oak,</b> <b>broadleaved</b> and bamboo decreased in area over 1998 – 2010 period. Both chir pine and khair have been the primary plantation species of the state, where the focus has revolved more around commercially important species rather than ecologically valuable ones. An increase {{in the area of}} chir pine over the period 1998 – 2010 may be attributed to {{an increase in}} the area under plantations of chir pine. This species is being tapped for resin and is the largest species raised under plantations in Himachal Pradesh constituting about 30.60  % of the total area under plantations and it registered an increase in area of 8265  ha over 1998 – 2001 (Planning Commission 2005). Also profuse regeneration under chir pine forests was observed during ground surveys of the study area. An increase in the area of khair may also be attributable to an increase in the area under plantations of khair which are a commercial source of kattha and cutch. While kattha is used in betel-vine preparations normally referred to as paan, cutch is a by-product of the kattha industry used for dyeing, colouring pulp in paper industry, water softening and in deep oil drilling operations. Khair is the second single largest species being raised under plantations in the state after chirpine constituting 17.64  % of the total area under plantations, and over 1998 – 2001 period, there has been reported an increase by over 7497  ha in the area under this species (Planning Commission 2005).|$|R
