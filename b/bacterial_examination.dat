40|$|Aeromonas sobria was {{isolated}} and identified upon post-mortem examination from the respiratory tract {{and the blood}} of a carpet python (Morelia spilota variegata). The snake was referred to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Liège for necropsy, just the day after it suddenly died without previous clinical sign. Lung and liver biopsies were performed and fixed in neutral buffered 10 % formalin and paraffin embedded. Blood samples were collected via cardiocentesis, and air sac abscesses were cultured. Bacterial strains were identified as Aeromonas sobria by 16 S rDNA sequencing. Based on histological and <b>bacterial</b> <b>examinations,</b> the death of this snake was attributed to a septicemia, following an acute primary, or secondary exudative pneumonia. Aeromonas sp. is established as a potential pathogen in reptiles. Among this genus, Aeromonas hydrophila is the most frequently isolated.

40|$|Bacterial {{arthritis}} is {{a rapidly}} progressive and highly destructive joint disease in humans, with Staphylococcus aureus and Neisseria gonorrhoeae the major causative agents, although beta-hemolytic streptococci as well often induce the disease. We demonstrate here that intravenous inoculation of CD- 1 mice {{with the group}} A streptococcus (GAS) species Streptococcus pyogenes resulted in {{a high incidence of}} septic arthritis. Signs of arthritis emerged within the first few days after injection, and <b>bacterial</b> <b>examinations</b> revealed that colonization of the inoculated GAS in the arthritic joints persisted for 21 days. Induction of persistent septic arthritis was dependent on the number of microorganisms inoculated. Immunohistochemical staining of GAS with anti-GAS antibodies revealed colonization in the joints of infected mice. Cytokine levels were quantified in the joints and sera of infected mice by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. High levels of interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) and IL- 6 were detected in the joints from 3 to 20 days after infection. We noted that an increase in the amount of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), which is a key cytokine in osteoclastogenesis, was also evident in the joints of the infected mice. RANKL was not detected in sera, indicating local production of RANKL in the infected joints. Blocking of RANKL by osteoprotegerin, a decoy receptor of RANKL, prevented bone destruction in the infected joints. These results suggest that GAS can colonize in the joints and induce bacterial arthritis. Local RANKL production in the infected joints may be involved in bone destruction...|$|R

30|$|SBP {{that occurs}} in {{patients}} with liver cirrhosis has some well-known disease-specific mechanisms. Based on the clinical observations, patients with portal hypertension are prone to develop bacterial translocation that conceivably causes SBP. This translocation is supported by increased levels of lipopolysaccharide which is a surrogate parameter of gram-negative bacteremia [8], bacterial overgrowth in the small bowel [9], and decreased barrier function of the intestine in patients with liver cirrhosis [10]. Our patient had portal hypertension that increased the probability of SBP irrespective of splenectomy. Notably, previous investigations on {{a substantial number of}} patients with cirrhosis and ascitic fluid infection revealed that SBP in the patients showed high mortality, and Escherichia coli (61.3  %) and S. pneumoniae (11.3  %) were the most causative organisms. Although we hesitated to draw ascites for <b>bacterial</b> <b>examination</b> due to high risk of intraperitoneal bleeding at the puncture, {{it turned out that the}} patient had bacteremia by blood culture test performed on admission.

The binding of 125 I-ASA-PRG to Streptococcus sanguis G 9 B displayed saturation kinetics, reversibility and was inhibited by unlabelled PRG. Inhibition studies with other glycoproteins and saccharides indicated that binding was mediated by a bacterial adhesin with specificity towards N-acetylneuraminic acid, galactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine. After cross-linking, the 125 I-ASA-PRG-adhesin complex could be extracted with SDS and separated from uncoupled 125 I-ASA-PRG by gel filtration on Sepharose CL- 6 B.
