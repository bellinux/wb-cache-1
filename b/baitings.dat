60|$|Consider {{the awful}} {{condition}} of the world before this thunder-bolt struck it. Could anyone, tracing back down the centuries and examining {{the record of the}} wickedness of man, find anything which could compare with the story of the nations during the last twenty years! Think of the condition of Russia during that time, with her brutal aristocracy and her drunken democracy, her murders on either side, her Siberian horrors, her Jew <b>baitings</b> and her corruption. Think of the figure of Leopold of Belgium, an incarnate devil who from motives of greed carried murder and torture through a large section of Africa, and yet was received in every court, and was eventually buried after a panegyric from a Cardinal of the Roman Church--a church which had never once raised her voice against his diabolical career. Consider the similar crimes in the Putumayo, where British capitalists, if not guilty of outrage, can at least not be acquitted of having condoned it by their lethargy and trust in local agents. Think of Turkey and the recurrent massacres of her subject races. Think of the heartless grind of the factories everywhere, where work assumed a very different and more unnatural shape than the ancient labour of the fields. Think of the sensuality of many rich, the brutality of many poor, the shallowness of many fashionable, the coldness and deadness of religion, the absence anywhere of any deep, true spiritual impulse. Think, above all, of the organised materialism of Germany, the arrogance, the heartlessness, the negation of everything which one could possibly associate with the living spirit of Christ as evident in the utterances of Catholic Bishops, like Hartmann of Cologne, as in those of Lutheran Pastors. Put all this together and say if the human race has ever presented a more unlovely aspect. When we try to find the brighter spots they are chiefly where civilisation, as apart from religion, has built up necessities for the community, such as hospitals, universities, and organised charities, as conspicuous in Buddhist Japan as in Christian Europe. We cannot deny that there has been much virtue, much gentleness, much spirituality in individuals. But the churches were empty husks, which contained no spiritual food for the human race, and had in the main ceased to influence its actions, save in the direction of soulless forms.|$|E

We used simulated baiting scenarios in Missouri and Louisiana to quantify and compare mortality between the LM and SM.

40|$|Abstract: The {{benefits}} of direct colony baiting are described: bait substrates enclosed in polyvinyl chloride tubes are applied in {{direct contact with}} the galleries of the termite nest. Attention of researchers is drawn to the potential of this method for species other than the mound-building Coptotermes 1 acteus. In the post-organochlorine era, knowledge of termite biology and behaviour is a precursor to effective control. This paper describes Australian experiences with termite baiting techniques and future directions for baiting research. EXPERIENCE WITH <b>BAITING</b> IN AUSTRALIA I first used baits to locate termites in 1979, after the method of La Fage and others (1973) as part of a study of the effects of removal of ground-wood by campers in Wyperfeld National Park in the desert of northwestern Victoria. By using rolls of toilet paper as baits and experimentally manipulating the wood supply it was possible to clearly show that fire-wood collection greatly diminished termite numbers (Ewart 1979).

40|$|Abstract Background Rabies is {{the most}} {{important}} viral zoonosis from a global perspective. Worldwide efforts to combat the disease by oral vaccination of reservoirs have managed to eradicate wildlife rabies in large areas of central Europe and North-America. Thus, repeated vaccination has been discontinued recently on a geographical scale. However, as rabies has not yet been eradicated globally, a serious risk of re-introduction remains. What is the best spatial design for an emergency vaccination program – particularly if resources are limited? Either, we treat a circular area around the detected case and run the risk of infected hosts leaving the limited control area, because a sufficient immunisation level has not yet been built up. Or, initially concentrate the SAME resources in order to establish a protective ring which is more distant from the infected local area, and which then holds out against the challenge of the approaching epidemic. Methods We developed a simulation model to contrast the two strategies for emergency vaccination. The spatial-explicit model is based on fox group home-ranges, which facilitates the simulation of rabies spread to larger areas relevant to management. We used individual-based fox groups to follow up the effects of vaccination in a detailed manner. Thus, regionally – bait distribution orientates itself to standard schemes of oral immunisation programs and locally – baits are assigned to individual foxes. Results Surprisingly, putting the controlled area ring-like around the outbreak does not outperform the circular area of the same size centred on the outbreak. Only during the very first <b>baitings,</b> does the ring area result in fewer breakouts. But then as rabies is eliminated within the circle area, the respective ring area fails, due to the non-controlled inner part. We attempt {{to take advantage of the}} initially fewer breakouts beyond the ring when applying a mixed strategy. Therefore, after a certain number of <b>baitings,</b> the area under control was increased for both strategies towards the same larger circular area. The circle-circle strategy still outperforms the ring-circle strategy and analysis of the spatial-temporal disease spread reveals why: improving control efficacy by means of a mixed strategy is impossible in the field, due to the build-up time of population immunity. Conclusion For practical emergency management of a new outbreak of rabies, the ring-like application of oral vaccination is not a favourable strategy at all. Even if initial resources are substantially low and there is a serious risk of rabies cases outside the limited control area, our results suggest circular application instead of ring vaccination. </p...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{synthesis}} of materials is facing enormous challenges {{at the present}} time. The necessary transition toward more sustainable economic processes requires new materials as well as optimized production of well-established materials. However, inorganic materials (e. g., ceramics or alloys) are typically produced industrially by high-temperature processes at up to 2000 °C. A relatively new approach for inorganic synthesis is based on so-called ionic liquids. Ionic liquids (ILs) — often defined as salts with melting points below 100 °C[1] — are usually composed of sterically demanding organic cations and (often) polyatomic anions, which can be selected in order to tune {{the properties of the}} IL. Owing to the distinctive physicochemical properties of ILs (e. g., wide liquidus range, high redox and thermal stability, (usually) negligible vapor pressure, tunable polarity), they have gained interest {{for a wide range of}} applications. Among the numerous inorganic materials accessible in ILs have been remarkable examples, especially in main-group element chemistry. For instance, a new metastable modification of germanium in the clathrate-II structure[2] or the largest known naked, main-group element cluster [Sn 36 Ge 24 Se 132] 24 – (“Zeoball”). [3] The introduction of Lewis-acidic ILs has enhanced the convenience of polycation syntheses and enabled substitution of carcinogenic or toxic substances like benzene, SO 2, or AsF 5. [4] A considerable number of polycations of group 15 or 16 elements has been synthesized in ILs. The utilization of an IL as reaction medium can be decisive for the composition, structure, and physical properties of the (polycationic) reaction product. [5] In order to broaden the knowledge on synthesis techniques for inorganic materials near ambient temperature based on ILs, this thesis aimed at two goals: •	Explorative {{synthesis of}} new inorganic compounds in ILs •	Elucidating the influence of ILs on product formation For these two goals, metal-rich (polycationic) compounds of group 15 were chosen as promising chemical system, owing to the effectiveness of alkylimidazolium-based Lewis-acidic ILs for the synthesis of this class of compounds. A variety of new polycationic compounds has been successfully synthesized in Lewis-acidic ILs based on 1 -n-butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium (or 1 -ethy- 3 -methylimidazolium) halides and halogenido-aluminates. Determination of the crystal structures by single-crystal X-ray diffraction enabled analysis of their bonding situation supported by quantum-chemical calculations. In general, the employed ILs enabled syntheses with a high selectivity for the yielded polycation. Depending on the investigated chemical system, the following parameters were pinpointed to have significant influence: •	Choice of starting materials •	Choice of cation as well as anion of the IL •	Reaction temperature •	Concentration of starting materials in the IL The investigations were supported by NMR spectroscopy, which led to the discovery of nanoparticles of red phosphorus. This finding may stimulate the development of an easily accessible, reactive form of phosphorus without the hazardous drawbacks of the white allotrope. In addition, in situ NMR measurements in ILs were proven a viable option for mechanistic investigations. Conventional solid-state reaction as well as ionothermal syntheses yielded the new layered compounds M 2 Bi 2 S 3 (AlCl 4) 2 (M = Cu, Ag), which can be interpreted as Bi 2 S 3 molecules embedded in MAlCl 4 salts. The choice of starting materials was found to have a crucial influence on the crystallized polytype. Omitting the IL hindered the formation of crystals suitable for single-crystal structure determination. The three new main-group element heteropolycations [Bi 6 Te 4 Br 2] 4 +, [Bi 3 S 4 AlCl] 3 +, and [Sb 13 Se 16] 7 + as well as known [Bi 4 Te 4] 4 + has been synthesized under ionothermal conditions. The Lewis-acidic ILs proved to be exceptional solvents for elements and their halides, and likewise for Bi 2 S 3 and Bi 2 Te 3. Hence, these solvents are not only advantageous reaction media for pnictogen and chalcogen chemistry but also potential (selective but expensive) ore-processing agents. These excellent solvent capabilities extend to complex ternary compounds including heavy transition metals such as Bi 16 PdCl 22 and elemental platinum. This gave rise to the synthesis of metal-rich salts containing [Bi 10] 4 + antiprisms with an endohedral palladium or, for the first time, platinum atom. Furthermore, the filled bismuth polycation [Rh@Bi 9] 4 + or the complex cluster [Rh 2 Bi 12] 4 + could be obtained from dissolution and conversion of Bi 12 −xRhX 13 –x (X = Cl, Br) depending on the employed IL. Real-space bonding analysis revealed that [Rh 2 Bi 12] 4 + acquires a unique standing between dative bonding by bismuth polyions and mixed clusters following Wade-Mingos rules. References [1]	J. S.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} construction of masculine identity at the intersection between early modern English drama and competitively violent entertainment. It argues that early modern Englishmen navigated a complex system of dangers and rewards associated with violent self-assertion, and that the playhouse represented a space uniquely suited to the embodying and interrogating of that system. Spaces used for performing plays frequently doubled as venues for cockfights, animal <b>baitings,</b> and fencing exhibitions, and the violence of such entertainments often appeared, either physically or rhetorically, in the period's drama. The project of the dissertation will be to provide a historicizing lens through which to view this violence "in play" {{in order to understand}} how early modern English drama refracted and participated in shaping the period's highly contested norms of violent self-assertion in the performance of male identity. Chapter One maps the cultural disruptions precipitated by the importation of the Italian rapier into late-sixteenth century England. It argues that the secretive exclusivity of rapier culture rendered its novel form of violent masculinity fundamentally "untheatrical" in comparison to more traditional male identities, leading playwrights to caricature the duelist as either a cowardly braggart or a treacherous assassin. Chapter Two examines Shakespeare's plays in light of the discourses described in Chapter One. Shakespeare's work consistently associates traditional weaponry with a threatened male honor culture while associating rapiers with the undermining of male identity through cowardice or treachery. Chapter Three considers the English hunt as a means of asserting a capacity for violence, focusing on attempts to use the wild boar as a means of restoring the hunt's fading masculine associations. The chapter ends with an extended reading of Thomas Heywood's Age plays, the English Renaissance theater's richest staging of hunting culture. Chapter Four offers an historically informed understanding of the interconnections between bearbaiting and theater by addressing the early modern image of the bear as both a terrifying representative of a threatening natural world and a figure of courageous self-defense in the face of overwhelming odds. 2016 - 11 - 18 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E
