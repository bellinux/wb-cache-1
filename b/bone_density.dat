To quantify <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> variations within the S 1 body and ala of young human specimens, especially along the pathways of sacral screws, {{and to examine}} the relation between sacral screw fixation and <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density.</b> Summary of Background Data. Vertebral bone quality is an essential factor in anterior or posterior screw fixation of the spine. Several {{studies have been conducted}} regarding <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> variations in the cervical and thoracolumbar spine. However, such variations in <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> in the sacrum have not been well documented. Methods. The <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> of 13 sacral specimens from young male cadavers (mean age, 31 years) was measured using highly accurate quantitative computed tomography. Variations in <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> were measured in five transverse layers and seven vertical columns within the S 1 body, and in four transverse layers and six vertical columns within the ala. The sacral screw insertion torque was measured (unicortical and bicortical), and the correlation with <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> was calculated. Results. The mean <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> of the S 1 body was 381. 9 ± 59 mg/cm 3, which was 31. 9 % higher than that of the sacral ala (mean, 296. 9 ± 86 mg/cm 3) (P< 0. 05). <b>Bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> of the superior sacral end-plate was higher than that of any other transverse layer. Columns near the lateral posterior and lateral anterior of the S 1 body had the highest <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density.</b> In the ala, <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> values of the internal columns (pedicle) were the highest. Screw insertion torque for bicortical purchase along the S 1 pedicle correlated well with the <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> of the S 1 body (r = 0. 67, P< 0. 05). Conclusion. This study quantified the volumetric <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> variations within the S 1 body and ala, and a significant linear correlation between the screw insertion torque and <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> was found.

Facial alveolar cortical bone thicknesses and cortical and cancellous <b>bone</b> <b>densities</b> at 4 selected miniscrew implant sites in both arches, together with cancellous <b>bone</b> <b>densities</b> of third cervical vertebrae, were measured.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study of a sample of 50 women, with minimum time since menopause between 1 and 10 years. <b>Bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> was assessed at the lumbar spine (L 2 &ndash;L 4), femoral neck, Ward&# 39;s triangle, and trochanter using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Body mass index, lean mass, fat mass, and basal energy expenditure were measured by bioimpedance. Results: The mean age of the women was 51. 49 &plusmn; 3. 86 years and time since menopause was 3. 50 &plusmn; 2. 59 years. Significant negative correlations were found between chronological age and lumbar spine, femoral neck, Ward&# 39;s triangle, and trochanteric <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density.</b> In regard to time since menopause, we also observed significant negative correlations with <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> at the lumbar spine and Ward&# 39;s triangle. The following significant positive correlations were recorded: body mass index with <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> at the femoral neck and trochanter; fat mass with <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> at the femoral neck and trochanter; lean mass with <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter; and basal energy expenditure with <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> at all sites assessed. On the other hand, the multiple linear regression model showed that: 20. 2 % of <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> variability at the lumbar spine is related to lean mass and time since menopause; 22. 3 % of <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> variability at the femoral neck is related to body weight and age; 18. 9 % of <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> variability at Ward&# 39;s triangle is related to age and basal energy expenditure; and 39 % of <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> variability at the trochanter is related to body mass index, age, and menarche. Conclusion: Changes in <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density,</b> specific for each skeletal site, are influenced by age, time since menopause, body weight, body mass index, lean mass, and basal energy expenditure. Lean mass and basal energy expenditure positively influenced <b>bone</b> mineral <b>density</b> at the lumbar spine and Ward&# 39;s triangle, with a predominance of trabecular bone.
