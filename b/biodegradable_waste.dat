A mixed fortnightly collection was shown {{to be the worst}} performing. This was considered confirmation of earlier suspicions that, if carried out correctly, separate collections can result in less wastage of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>waste.</b> A widespread pilot scheme for separate food waste collection, involving nineteen English local authorities, achieved success and 'high levels of satisfaction' from households.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, food waste's {{effect on}} the {{environment}} has been an issue. Ireland is facing fines of millions of euros if the amount of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>waste</b> it sends to landfill does not fall below the maximum quantity set by the European Union's Landfill Directive. By 2010, the same directive will impose fines of £40m a year across England, rising to £205m by 2013, if its own targets on biodegradable municipal waste are not met; the amount of biodegradable municipal waste being sent to landfill in 2010 must be 75% of that sent in 1995, by 2013 it must be 50% and by 2020 it must be 35%.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that given its proportion of the waste stream and the lack of distinct collections, food waste is not currently being targeted appropriately. However proposals by the European Union, which would require local authorities to provide separate collection of food and garden waste, have been met with opposition; critics of the proposals argue that local authorities understand the specific needs of the areas they serve, and that they should decide waste policy. Advocates of the proposals say that it will ensure energy is not wasted in sorting <b>biodegradable</b> <b>waste</b> from other materials.|$|E

Adequate EU and RS strategies, legislation and well-known good practises (IPPC directive/BAT/BREF) were studied. Alternative contemporary proceedings for <b>waste</b> sludges and <b>biodegradable</b> <b>wastes</b> treatment were checked and compared by SWOT analysis. An examination of actual treatment with such kind of wastes was carried out for Gorenjska region. Three different options of contemporary <b>biodegradable</b> <b>wastes</b> and waste sludges treatment were experimentally checked. Findings were corroborated with physical – chemical – biological analyses of entry materials and final products and also with characteristics and products applicability of single option. An economic seight was studied for single option, too. In view of received data the most appropriate method for integrated treatment of <b>waste</b> sludges and <b>biodegradable</b> <b>wastes</b> in Gorenjska region was proposed; namely anaerobic digestion with biogas production, followed by composting of the residue. Entry quantities of <b>waste</b> sludges and <b>biodegradable</b> <b>wastes</b> were anticipated; also size and site of the Centre for integrated treatment of <b>waste</b> sludges and <b>biodegradable</b> <b>wastes</b> of Gorenjska region were suggested. In the centre considerable quantities of biogas can be produced and utilised for electricity and heat cogeneration. The coproduction was estimated of about 260 kW electricity power and 375 kW heat power. Composting of the digested sludge takes place in special unit out of the centre. On the base of expected costs and incomes the 12 years return period of investment in the centre was calculated...|$|R

Both planning and design of integrated municipal solid waste management systems require accurate prediction of solid waste generation. This paper discusses the potential household <b>biodegradable</b> municipal <b>waste</b> (BMW) generation for the Dublin Region, Ireland, using statistical data on socio-demographics, particularly household size and social class as the main variables. Historical research was used to assign BMW generation rates. A Geographical Information System (GIS) "model" of BMW generation was created using ArcMap, a component of ArcGIS 9. BMW generation was predicted within a diverse "landscape" of residential areas. The results highlight the importance of tailoring waste management strategies to small management areas...|$|R

When disposed of in landfill, food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The food supply chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping food waste that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Currently, {{much of our}} <b>biodegradable</b> <b>wastes</b> such as kitchen wastes, {{agricultural}} wastes & animal wastes are used to produce Biogas, a powerful greenhouse gas. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a treatment that composts these wastes {{in the absence of}} oxygen, producing a biogas {{that can be used to}} generate Heat & Power. Producing renewable energy from our <b>biodegradable</b> <b>wastes</b> helps to tackle the energy crisis. It is effectively a controlled and enclosed version of the anaerobic breakdown of organic wastes which releases methane. AD produces a biogas made up of around 60 per cent methane and 40 per cent carbon dioxide (CO). As well as biogas, AD produces a solid and liquid residue called digestate which can be used as a soil conditioner to fertilise land. The amount of biogas and the quality of digestates obtained will vary according to the feedstock used. More gas will be produced if the feedstock is more liable to decompose.

25|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{is used as}} part of {{the process}} to treat <b>biodegradable</b> <b>waste</b> and sewage sludge. As part of an integrated waste management system, anaerobic digestion reduces the emission of landfill gas into the atmosphere. Anaerobic digesters can also be fed with purpose-grown energy crops, such as maize.|$|E
25|$|Biogas is methane {{produced}} {{by the process of}} anaerobic digestion of organic material by anaerobes. It can be produced either from <b>biodegradable</b> <b>waste</b> materials or by the use of energy crops fed into anaerobic digesters to supplement gas yields.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} waste {{gasification}} as a technology allowing co-firing of {{large quantities of}} <b>biodegradable</b> <b>wastes</b> in power boilers. In contrast to common landfilling and direct co-firing, gasification of wastes presents a number of advantages. Problematic species in original feedstocks can be partly safely incinerated in the furnace and partly retained in the gasification residues. Little effect on power boiler operation in terms of long term phenomena like fouling or corrosion {{is expected to be}} associated with co-firing of low calorific gas in standard coal powered boilers. Moreover, combustion characteristics in the furnace can even benefit from the co-firing of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>wastes</b> due to an enhanced reburning effect. The paper focuses on proper introduction of low-calorific gases derived from gasification of biomass and wastes into solid fuel fired boilers. Possible injection methods are described and the influence of co-firing low calorific value gas on power boiler operation is discussed. JRC. F. 2 -Cleaner energie...|$|R

25|$|Throughout most of history, {{the amount}} of waste {{generated}} by humans was insignificant due to low population density and low societal levels of the exploitation of natural resources.

25|$|Landfilling {{practices}} in the UK have had to change {{in recent years to}} meet the challenges of the European Landfill Directive. The UK now imposes landfill tax upon <b>biodegradable</b> <b>waste</b> which is put into landfills. In addition to this the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme has been established for local authorities to trade landfill quotas in England. A different system operates in Wales where authorities are not able to 'trade' between themselves, but have allowances known as the Landfill Allowance Scheme.|$|E
25|$|The {{methodology}} and other assumptions may also influence the results significantly.

40|$|Excerpt] A {{composting}} {{project in}} a school, {{either in the}} classroom or on the school property, can be a terrific opportunity for students to gain direct knowledge and experience with natural processes and a method of reducing and recycling <b>biodegradable</b> <b>wastes.</b> Although composting utilizes natural decay processes, these processes are occurring in a relatively small, concentrated area of a pile or bin. There is a potential for human exposure to the organisms involved and the products they produce...|$|R
25|$|The process {{involves}} a biological/chemical method for converting any biodegradable material (e.g., urban wastes, such as municipal solid waste, <b>biodegradable</b> <b>waste,</b> and sewage sludge, agricultural residues such as corn stover, sugarcane bagasse, cotton gin trash, manure) into useful chemicals, such as carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, butyric acid), ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone) and biofuels, {{such as a}} mixture of primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, n-butanol) and/or a mixture of secondary alcohols (e.g., isopropanol, 2-butanol, 3-pentanol). Because of the many products that can be economically produced, this process is a true biorefinery.|$|E
25|$|The third {{byproduct}} is {{a liquid}} (methanogenic digestate) rich in nutrients, {{which can be}} used as a fertiliser, depending on the quality of the material being digested. Levels of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) should be chemically assessed. This will depend upon the quality of the original feedstock. In the case of most clean and source-separated <b>biodegradable</b> <b>waste</b> streams, the levels of PTEs will be low. In the case of wastes originating from industry, the levels of PTEs may be higher and will need to be taken into consideration when determining a suitable end use for the material.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of gasification is that using the syngas (synthesis gas H2/CO) is potentially {{more efficient than}} direct combustion of the original fuel {{because it can be}} combusted at higher temperatures or even in fuel cells, so that the thermodynamic upper limit to the efficiency defined by Carnot's rule is higher or (in case of fuel cells) not applicable. Syngas may be burned directly in gas engines, used to produce methanol and hydrogen, or converted via the Fischer–Tropsch process into synthetic fuel. Gasification can also begin with material which would otherwise have been disposed of such as <b>biodegradable</b> <b>waste.</b> In addition, the high-temperature process refines out corrosive ash elements such as chloride and potassium, allowing clean gas production from otherwise problematic fuels. Gasification of fossil fuels is currently widely used on industrial scales to generate electricity.|$|E
