500|$|Michelle Erica Green {{watched the}} episode for TrekNation in May 2009. She also {{thought that it}} was a {{pleasant}} episode but that it [...] "never approaches greatness". She felt that D'Sora never achieved the intimacy that Ishara Yar did with Data, and that the subplot was simply something created so that Picard had something to do. She summed up the ending of the episode by saying that [...] "I don't believe that Data can't be hurt emotionally, but he's more invested in his cat than he ever seems to be in Jenna D'Sora." [...] Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com in May 2012, describing it as a [...] "clunker" [...] and a re-hash of the earlier episode [...] "" [...] but [...] "without the gravitas". He thought that having Picard pilot the shuttle was ridiculous, especially as the character admitted in the episode [...] "11001001" [...] that it had <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> he had worked the helm of a ship. He summed it up saying that, [...] "ultimately, it's a rehash of a Wesley Crusher episode. A really really bad Wesley Crusher episode" [...] and gave it a score of two out of ten.|$|E

"Hung Up" [...] {{was ranked}} at number 76 on Rolling Stones [...] "100 Best Songs of the 2000s" [...] decade-end list, calling it [...] "One of her [...] most {{captivating}} hits ever — {{and thanks to}} those deceptively hard-hitting lyrics, {{one of her most}} personal." [...] NME ranked it at number 39 in their list of the best tracks of 2005. Slant Magazine's writers listed the song at number 36 on their list of Best of the Aughts: Singles saying: [...] "'Hung Up' employs a ticking clock to represent fear of wasted time, but Madonna isn't singing about aging or saving the world—she's talking about love. It had <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> Madge sounded this vapid. With its pitched-upward vocals, infectious arpeggio sample from ABBA's 'Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight),' and the bridge's unironic, archetypical key change, the track decidedly points to the past, and it proved that, 20 years into her career, Madonna was still the one and only Dancing Queen". The song was also named the 26th best single of 2005 by Pitchfork Media. Stylus Magazine included [...] "Hung Up" [...] on their ranking of the best singles from 2005 at number 11. In 2016, [...] "Hung Up" [...] was named in the online poll by Digital Spy, as [...] "The Biggest Pop Song of the 21st Century".|$|E

Unfortunately, upon opening the coffin, Kau notices the body is still intact, {{even though it has}} <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> he died. Realising that it is a vampire, Kau orders it to be moved to his house for further study and to be subject to spells that will prevent it from awakening. Kau deduces that Yam's father had died angry, and his last breath became stuck in his body for years, causing it to keep him [...] "alive" [...] and reducing it to a mindless state.|$|E

2500|$|Horowitz {{gave his}} United States debut on January 12, 1928, in Carnegie Hall. He played Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 under the {{direction}} of Sir Thomas Beecham, who was also making his U.S. debut. Horowitz later commented that he and Beecham had divergent ideas regarding tempos, and that Beecham was conducting the score [...] "from memory and he didn't know" [...] the piece. Horowitz's rapport with his audience was phenomenal. Olin Downes, writing for The New York Times, was critical about the metric tug of war between conductor and soloist, but Downes credited the pianist with both a beautiful singing tone in the second movement and a tremendous technique in the finale, referring to Horowitz's playing as a [...] "tornado unleashed from the steppes". In this debut performance, Horowitz demonstrated a marked ability to excite his audience, an ability he maintained for his entire career. As Downes commented, [...] "it has <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> a pianist created such a furor with an audience in this city." [...] In his review of Horowitz's solo recital, Downes characterized the pianist's playing as showing [...] "most if not all the traits of a great interpreter." [...] In 1933, he played {{for the first time with}} the conductor Arturo Toscanini in a performance of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 Emperor. Horowitz and Toscanini went on to perform together many times, on stage and in recordings. Horowitz settled in the U.S. in 1939, and became an American citizen in 1944. [...] He made his television debut in a concert taped at Carnegie Hall on February 1, 1968, and broadcast nationwide by CBS on September 22 of that year.|$|E

6000|$|By and by {{she fell}} asleep, only to dream that the package was a caressing hand {{stealing}} about her, feeling for hers, and holding it with soft, strong clasp. When she awoke {{she had the}} strangest sensation in her right palm. It was moist, throbbing, hot, and the feel of it on her cheek was strangely thrilling and comforting. She lay awake then. The night was dark and still. Only a low moan of wind in the pines and the faint tinkle of a sheep bell broke the serenity. She felt very small and lonely lying there in the deep forest, and, try how she would, {{it was impossible to}} think the same then as she did in the clear light of day. Resentment, pride, anger--these seemed abated now. If {{the events of the day}} had not changed her, they had at least brought up softer and kinder memories and emotions than she had known for long. Nothing hurt and saddened her so much as to remember the gay, happy days of her childhood, her sweet mother, her, old home. Then her thought returned to Isbel and his gift. It had <b>been</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> anyone had made her a gift. What could this one be? It did not matter.
