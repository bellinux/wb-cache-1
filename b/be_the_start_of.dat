5|$|Fingleton scored 66 for the Australians in an innings {{victory over}} Western Australia before sailing for South Africa. It was to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> a very {{productive}} campaign. In the three matches {{leading up to}} the Tests, against Natal, Western Province and Transvaal respectively, Fingleton scored 121, 53, 99 and seven not out. Australia won the latter match by ten wickets and the others by an innings. In the match by Natal, Fingleton and Brown both made centuries and combined in a double century stand.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} the Barnard Fellowship had expired, and Rabi and Helen were living off a $182 per month stipend from the Rockefeller Foundation. They left Hamburg for Leipzig, where he hoped to work with Heisenberg. In Leipzig, he found Robert Oppenheimer, a fellow New Yorker. It would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> a long friendship. Heisenberg {{departed}} for {{a tour of the}} United States in March 1929, so Rabi and Oppenheimer decided to go to the ETH Zurich, where Pauli was now the professor of physics. Rabi's education in physics was enriched by the leaders in the field he met there, which included Paul Dirac, Walter Heitler, Fritz London, Francis Wheeler Loomis, John von Neumann, John Slater, Leó Szilárd and Eugene Wigner.|$|E

In October 2016, Rowling confirmed that the series would comprise five films. In November 2016 {{it was confirmed that}} Johnny Depp will have a starring role in the sequel, reprising his role as Gellert Grindelwald. In April 2017, it was confirmed that Jude Law had been cast for the role of Albus Dumbledore at around the time he was the Transfiguration professor at Hogwarts. The second film will take place in the United Kingdom and Paris. Principal photography for the second film began in July 2017.|$|E

5|$|The 1995 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was a hyperactive Atlantic {{hurricane season}} that {{is generally considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the high-activity era of tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic basin. It's tied with 1887, 2010, 2011, and 2012 for having the third most number of named storms. The season produced twenty-one tropical cyclones, nineteen named storms, as well as eleven hurricanes and five major hurricanes. The season officially began on June1 and ended on November30, dates which conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin. The first tropical cyclone, Hurricane Allison, developed on June2, while the season's final storm, Hurricane Tanya, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November1.|$|E
5|$|In the 1964 Copa Libertadores, Santos {{were beaten}} in both {{legs of the}} semi-finals by Independiente. The club won the Campeonato Paulista, with Pelé netting 34 goals. Santos also shared the Rio-São Paulo title with Botafogo and won the Taça Brasil for the fourth {{consecutive}} year. In the 1965 Copa Libertadores, Santos reached the semi-finals and met Peñarol in a rematch of the 1962 final. After two matches, a playoff was needed to break the tie. Unlike 1962, Peñarol came out on top and eliminated Santos 2–1. Pelé would, however, finish as the topscorer of the tournament with eight goals. This proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> a decline as Santos failed to retain the Torneio Rio-São Paulo. In 1966, Pelé and Santos also failed to retain the Taça Brasil as Pelé's goals were not enough to prevent a 9–4 defeat by Cruzeiro (led by Tostão) in the final series. The club did, however, win the Campeonato Paulista in 1967, 1968 and 1969. On 19 November 1969, Pelé scored his 1000th goal in all competitions, in what was a highly anticipated moment in Brazil. The goal, popularly dubbed O Milésimo (The Thousandth), occurred in a match against Vasco da Gama, when Pelé scored from a penalty kick, at the Maracanã Stadium.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand's 3–1 series {{win over}} the Lions in 1959 proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> a {{dominant}} period in All Black rugby. This {{was followed by the}} 1963–64 tour to Britain and Ireland, led by Wilson Whineray, in which New Zealand were deprived of a Grand Slam by a scoreless draw with Scotland. The only loss on this tour was to Newport RFC, who won 3–0 at Rodney Parade, Newport on 30 October 1963. The 1967 side won three tests against the home nations, but was unable to play Ireland because of a foot-and-mouth scare. This tour formed part of New Zealand's longest winning streak, between 1965 and 1970, of 17 test victories. This was also the longest test winning streak by any nation at the time; it would be equalled by the Springboks in 1998, and surpassed by Lithuania in 2010. Although the 1966 Lions were defeated 0–4 in their New Zealand tour, there was a reversal of fortune five years later when the 1971 Lions, under the captaincy of Welshman John Dawes, beat New Zealand in a test series, which remains the Lions' only series victory in New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|The {{first public}} {{controversy}} regarding Zwingli's preaching broke {{out during the}} season of Lent in 1522. On the first fasting Sunday, 9 March, Zwingli and about a dozen other participants consciously transgressed the fasting rule by cutting and distributing two smoked sausages (the Wurstessen in Christoph Froschauer's workshop). Zwingli defended this act in a sermon which was published on 16 April, under the title Von Erkiesen und Freiheit der Speisen (Regarding the Choice and Freedom of Foods). He noted that no general valid rule on food {{can be derived from}} the Bible and that to transgress such a rule is not a sin. The event, which came to be referred to as the Affair of the Sausages, is considered to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the Reformation in Switzerland. Even before the publication of this treatise, the diocese of Constance reacted by sending a delegation to Zurich. The city council condemned the fasting violation, but assumed responsibility over ecclesiastical matters and requested the religious authorities clarify the issue. The bishop responded on 24 May by admonishing the Grossmünster and city council and repeating the traditional position.|$|E

25|$|Rio de Janeiro: 30 June 1886, Theatro Lyrico Fluminense. During rehearsals at the Theatro Lyrico {{there was}} an ongoing quarrel between the {{performers}} of the Italian touring opera company and the local inept conductor, {{with the result that}} substitute conductors were rejected by the audience. Arturo Toscanini, at the time a 19-year-old cellist who was assistant chorus master, was persuaded to take up the baton for the performance.

25|$|The Constitutional Court of South Africa {{recognized}} aboriginal {{title in}} Alexkor v Richtersveld Community (2003), a suit under the Restitution of Land Rights Act 1994.

The Supreme Court of Appeal disagreed, citing Mabo and Yorta Yorta, but held that the aboriginal title had been extinguished. Whether the precedent will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> further land rights claims by indigenous peoples is an open question, given the cut-off date of 1913 in the Restitution Act.|$|E
25|$|The main {{proponent of}} the Reformation in Switzerland was Ulrich Zwingli, whose actions during the Affair of the Sausages are now {{considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the Reformation in Switzerland. His own studies, in the renaissance humanist tradition, had led him to preach against injustices and hierarchies in the Church already in 1516 {{while he was still}} a priest in Einsiedeln. When he was called to Zürich, he expanded his criticism also onto political topics and in particular condemned the mercenary business. His ideas were received favourably, especially by entrepreneurs, businessmen, and the guilds. The first disputation of Zürich of 1523 was the breakthrough: the city council decided to implement his reformatory plans and to convert to Protestantism.|$|E
25|$|He joined Buckinghamshire for the 1914 Minor Counties Championship, {{making his}} debut against Wiltshire.

Edwards made 165 appearances for Buckinghamshire in the Minor Counties Championship. He finished his career with the county having taken 1,082 wickets at an impressive average of 10.91 runs. His most prolific season was in 1923, when in 10 matches he took 104 wickets at an average of 9.99.
