5|$|The {{principal}} {{sources of}} silver are the ores of copper, copper-nickel, lead, and lead-zinc obtained from Peru, <b>Bolivia,</b> Mexico, China, Australia, Chile, Poland and Serbia. Peru, <b>Bolivia</b> and Mexico have been mining silver since 1546, {{and are still}} major world producers. Top silver-producing mines are Cannington (Australia), Fresnillo (Mexico), San Cristóbal (<b>Bolivia),</b> Antamina (Peru), Rudna (Poland), and Penasquito (Mexico). Top near-term mine development projects through 2015 are Pascua Lama (Chile), Navidad (Argentina), Jaunicipio (Mexico), Malku Khota (<b>Bolivia),</b> and Hackett River (Canada).

5|$|These {{industrialization}} measures proved largely unsuccessful {{given that}} coca remained illegal in most nations outside <b>Bolivia,</b> thus depriving the growers {{of an international}} market. Campaigning against this, in 2012 <b>Bolivia</b> withdrew from the UN 1961 Convention which had called for global criminalisation of coca, and in 2013 successfully convinced the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs to declassify coca as a narcotic. The U.S. State Department criticised <b>Bolivia,</b> asserting that it was regressing in its counter-narcotics efforts, and dramatically reduced aid to <b>Bolivia</b> to $34 million to fight the narcotics trade in 2007. Nevertheless, the number of cocaine seizures in <b>Bolivia</b> increased under Morales' government, as they sought to encourage coca growers to report and oppose cocaine producers and traffickers. However, high levels of police corruption surrounding the illicit trade in cocaine remained a continuing problem for <b>Bolivia.</b>|$|E

5|$|Filmmaker Terrence Malick {{originally}} {{worked on}} a screenplay limited to Guevara's attempts to start a revolution in <b>Bolivia.</b> When financing fell through, Malick left the project, and Soderbergh subsequently agreed to direct the film. He {{realized that there was}} no context for Guevara's actions in <b>Bolivia</b> and decided that his participation in the Cuban Revolution and his appearance at the United Nations in 1964 should also be depicted. Peter Buchman was hired to write the screenplay: the script was so long that Soderbergh decided to divide the film into two parts, one chronicling Cuba and other depicting <b>Bolivia.</b> Soderbergh shot the installments back-to-back starting at the beginning of July 2007, with Guerrilla first in Spain for 39 days, and The Argentine shot in Puerto Rico and Mexico for 39 days.|$|E

Brazil signed a treaty with <b>Bolívia</b> in which <b>Bolivia</b> agreed to strengthen its border defenses to deter any attack by Rosas, though it declined to contribute troops to a war with Argentina.|$|E

5|$|Bolivia's U.S. embassy {{had become}} {{publicly}} {{highly critical of}} Morales; {{just prior to the}} election, the U.S. ambassador to <b>Bolivia</b> Manuel Rocha issued a statement declaring that U.S. aid to <b>Bolivia</b> would be cut if MAS won the election. However, exit polls revealed that Rocha's comments had served to increase support for Morales. Following the election, the U.S. embassy maintained this critical stance, characterising Morales as a criminal and encouraging Bolivia's traditional parties to sign a broad agreement to oppose the MAS; Morales himself began alleging that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was plotting to assassinate him.|$|E
