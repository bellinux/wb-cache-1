5|$|Fought at the {{junction}} of the east-west and north-south roads {{on the eastern side}} of the Black Forest, the day-long battle at Stockach and Engen pitted the two armies against each other for the second time in seven days. The Austrians still had the numerical superiority, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was closer to two-to-one, instead of almost three-to-one. Jourdan had consolidated his force over a shorter line, and had the full Army of the Danube under his direct command. Charles, likewise, had shortened his line; although Hotze had not yet caught up with the archduke, he and his 10,000men were approaching from the Austrians' left rear.|$|E

Ricciardo's session was marred by another technical problem, this time an engine failure to his newly equipped power unit.

On 18 December 2015, Harvey released a 20-second teaser for the album, which contained a release date of spring 2016.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, play resumed under {{hot and humid}} conditions. There had been rain on the pitch at 07:00, and Bradman resumed {{proceedings}} by taking a single from a Bedser no ball. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over of the day, Pollard got the second ball to lift. Caught out by the unexpected bounce, Hassett was unable {{to get out of}} the way and edged the ball to Crapp in the slips for 13. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball in the same place as he did to Hassett, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> skidded low off the pitch, deviated back in and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman backed away from the ball as it cut off the pitch with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to get behind the ball to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett.|$|E
5|$|Each Surface overworld had a {{specific}} theme: the forest overworld revolved around landforms altering gameplay, the volcano overworld focused around {{changing the rules}} of gameplay, while the desert overworld was themed around duality between past and present. The first areas, the Sealed Grounds and Faron Woods, were created so players could be eased into the game's mechanics and navigation. While the forest areas were made to be mostly flat, the Eldin Volcano overworld was made with height differences in mind to provide a greater challenge. Elements in the volcano terrain included areas of lava, and slopes where Link's sprinting ability would become necessary for reaching new areas. For the Lanayru Desert, the team created three different overworld zones due to its unique time shifting mechanics, triggered with Time Shift stones: this shifting between different zones was inspired by similar systems in Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess. The portable Time Shift stones were one of many ideas included in the desert overworld as they did not fit with the forest or volcano environments. A difficult feature to include naturally was the remnants of Lanayru's Ancient Civilization, which used electricity to power both its technology and citizens. Enemy types that recurred in all Surface-based overworld areas were given slightly altered designs so they would be unique to each overworld. The Silent Realms were created as a new mechanic, filled with enemies {{that could not be}} defeated and relying on Link's sprinting ability rather than his weapons or items. While they had experimented with indestructible enemies in Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was changed by restricting Link's options and actions. They also created a time limit for added strategy, as knowledge of the areas where the Spirit Realms were located was key to completing them. This was also why they were set up in areas players would already be familiar with. They were originally in the form of special dungeons, but this was discarded in favor of the familiar areas.|$|E

The next day Punk defeated Rey Mysterio at Armageddon to win the tournament. On the January 5, 2009, episode of Raw, Punk received his title match against William Regal, which ended in a disqualification, when Regal grabbed the referee's jersey. Due to this, Stephanie McMahon awarded Punk a rematch the following week, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was himself that was disqualified. McMahon awarded him another rematch, this time a No Disqualification match on January 19 Raw, Punk won the match and the title. With this win, he became the 19th Triple Crown Champion, and the fastest to accomplish the feat, shattering Kevin Nash's old record. Punk lost the title on the March 9 Raw to JBL. At WrestleMania XXV, Punk won the Money in the Bank ladder match and became the first person to win the match twice.|$|E

In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over bowled by Pollard, Hassett fell for 13 on the second ball, which lifted suddenly after bouncing. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over.

O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to get behind the ball to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett. The crowd, sensing the importance of the two quick wickets, in particular that of Bradman, who had been so productive at Headingley, erupted. This left Australia struggling at 3/68, but a rapid counterattack by the middle and lower order took them to 9/457 at stumps and eventually 458 on the fourth morning.|$|E
5|$|The Ryder Cup {{was played}} {{outside of the}} British Isles {{for the first time}} in 1997, as Valderrama Golf Club in Spain hosted the contest. Despite taking a five-point lead into the final day, Europe needed the half point Colin Montgomerie secured in his tied singles match with Scott Hoch to win 14½–13½. The 1999 match was the third time in {{succession}} the contest had been won by a single point, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was the United States who won 14½–13½. This was not without controversy, as Europe were unhappy with the celebrations by the American team after a putt by Justin Leonard, while European golfer José María Olazábal still had a chance of holing his putt. The Ryder Cup was scheduled to be played in 2001, but two weeks before the competition was scheduled to take place the September 11 attacks occurred. The United States fearing for their safety requested the match be played a year later in 2002. When the match was played, Europe won 15½–12½ to regain the Cup. They retained the Cup in 2004 when they won 18½–9½ at Oakland Hills Country Club, in what was the United States' heaviest defeat in the competition. The result was repeated in 2006 at the K Club. Europe's 18½–9½ victory marked the first time they had won three matches in succession. The United States regained the Ryder Cup in 2008, winning for the first time since 1999. They won the match when Jim Furyk beat Miguel Ángel Jiménez with four singles matches still ongoing, to win 16½–11½. A tight contest in 2010 came down to the final singles match between European Graeme McDowell and American golfer Hunter Mahan. McDowell won his match with a hole to spare, to give Europe a 14½–13½ victory. Europe recovered a 10–6 deficit on the last day in 2012, as they won eight of the twelve singles matches to win 14½–13½.|$|E
