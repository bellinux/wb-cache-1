5|$|Upon {{its initial}} release, Animal House {{received}} generally mixed reviews from critics, <b>but</b> <b>Time</b> and Roger Ebert proclaimed {{it one of}} the year's best. Filmed for only $2.8 million, {{it is one of the}} most profitable movies in history, garnering an estimated gross of more than $141 million in the form of theatrical rentals and home video, not including merchandising.|$|E
5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, <b>but</b> <b>time</b> will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E
5|$|For Cagney's next film, he {{traveled}} to Ireland for Shake Hands with the Devil, directed by Michael Anderson. Cagney had hoped {{to spend some time}} tracing his Irish ancestry, <b>but</b> <b>time</b> constraints and poor weather meant that he was unable to do so. The overriding message of violence inevitably leading to more violence attracted Cagney to the role of an Irish Republican Army commander, and resulted in what some critics would regard as the finest performance of his final years.|$|E

5|$|Goldsmith scored The Motion Picture over {{a period}} of three to four months, a {{relatively}} relaxed schedule compared to typical production, <b>but</b> <b>time</b> pressures resulted in Goldsmith bringing on colleagues to assist in the work. Alexander Courage, composer of the original Star Trek theme, provided arrangements to accompany Kirk's log entries, while Fred Steiner wrote eleven cues of additional music, notably the music to accompany the Enterprise achieving warp speed and first meeting V'Ger. The rush to finish the rest of the film impacted the score. The final recording session finished at 2:00 am on December 1, only five days before the film's release.|$|E
5|$|The Falcons {{began their}} drive at the Tech 30-yard line after the fumble, which {{effectively}} eliminated any chance Tech had {{to earn the}} two scores needed to regain the lead. The Falcons moved the ball effectively down the field, running out the clock as they did so. Bart Weiss finally broke through the Tech defense for a 12-yard gain and the Falcons' final touchdown of the game. Though the extra point kick was missed, Air Force had taken an insurmountable 237 lead with 2:08 remaining in the game. Following Air Force's post-touchdown kickoff, Tech's offense returned to the field at its 20-yard line. The first play of the Hokies' drive resulted in a 10-yard holding penalty against Tech. With time winding down, Tech advanced the ball successfully via several passes, <b>but</b> <b>time</b> ran out shortly after Tech crossed the 50-yard line. Air Force clinched a 237 victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{avalanche}} of editorial opinion continued the following day, Sunday, September 21, but Eisenhower continued to withhold judgment. The general considered asking retired Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts {{to evaluate the}} legality of the Fund, <b>but</b> <b>time</b> constraints ruled him out. Eisenhower decided to ask the Los Angeles law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher for a legal opinion, while asking the accounting firm Price Waterhouse to audit the Fund's records. Nixon, meanwhile, was encouraged by a supportive telegram from his mother and discouraged by one from former Minnesota governor Harold Stassen urging him to resign from the ticket. New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey, a Nixon supporter, called to tell the senator that most Eisenhower aides favored his removal, and that if Nixon made the telecast, he should call for people to write to express their opinions. Dewey added that if the response was not strongly pro-Nixon, the senator should leave the ticket.|$|E

5|$|The {{scores were}} tied fifteen times, and {{at no point}} were the Australians more than five points in front. With six minutes {{to go in the}} final quarter, the Gliders were up by only two points, with the score 45–43. Crispin was sent to the free-throw line where she {{extended}} her team's lead to 47–43. A technical foul saw her straight back to the free-throw line to make it 48–43, the Gliders' biggest lead of the game. Brazil then struck back, scoring five unanswered points to tie the score again at 48–48, but Merritt scored one from the paint to put the Gliders back in front. She followed by taking a defensive rebound and then another shot to make it 52–48. Brazil scored once more, <b>but</b> <b>time</b> ran out, and the Gliders won, 52–50. Leading scorers for the Gliders were Crispin with 18 points and Merritt with 16.|$|E
5|$|At the {{military}} fort, Alex's reflection {{appears in a}} mirror, giving Alex advice. A ghost then questions them and possesses Jonas, revealing that the ghosts are the passengers of the submarine USS Kanaloa, thought lost at sea. Alex creates another rift that revives Jonas. They find Clarissa, <b>but</b> <b>time</b> loops to her jumping to her death, and then disappearing. Nona, Alex, Jonas and Ren regroup at Harden Tower. Unable to send a radio transmission off the island, Ren suggests finding the key to Maggie Adler's estate, where she kept a boat. The group go to Adler's estate. A possessed Clarissa talks with Ren; her conversations and scattered letters left behind by Maggie Adler reveal that Adler mistakenly interpreted scrambled messages from Kanaloa as an enemy transmission, and the submarine was sunk by friendly fire. The crew were not killed, however, but transported to another dimension due to the sub's experimental nuclear reactor. Adler and her friend Anna attempted {{to communicate with the}} Kanaloa crew via a radio, but Anna was absorbed through the gateway. The Kanaloa crew intend on using Alex and her friends' bodies to escape the dimension, keeping them on the island long enough for their possession attempts to be successful.|$|E
5|$|The Vikings won the toss and deferred. Despite a 49-yard kick return by Deonte Thompson, the Bears' struggles began quickly, {{with the}} drive {{stalling}} after a holding penalty on Hroniss Grasu and a sack. Afterwards, the Vikings scored {{on their first}} drive when Stefon Diggs beat Tracy Porter to score on a 15-yard touchdown. The Vikings increased the score with Blair Walsh's 53-yard field goal in the second quarter. After the next two drives ended with punts, Alshon Jeffery caught a ten-yard touchdown pass from Jay Cutler to draw the Bears within three points. On the following series, the Vikings responded when Teddy Bridgewater escaped a blitz to throw a pass to Jerick McMcKinnon, who beat Shea McClellin to score on the 17-yard play. To start the second half, the Bears attempted an onside kick, and Sherrick McManis recovered. However, after three plays, Brian Robison sacked and stripped Jay Cutler, recovering the fumble; Minnesota took advantage with Stefon Diggs beating Alan Ball to score on the 33-yard touchdown. The Bears decreased the margin to two touchdowns when Robbie Gould kicked a 51-yard field goal; the next three consecutive drives concluded with punts. Afterwards, Cutler's screen pass to Matt Forte was intercepted by Justin Trattou, and the Vikings capitalized on the turnover with Bridgewater's 12-yard touchdown run, though the Bears retaliated with Cutler's four-yard touchdown pass to Forte. The Bears attempted another onside kick, but failed, and the Vikings later scored again on Zach Line's four-yard touchdown. With 1:50 left in the game, the Bears drove {{as far as the}} Vikings' 28-yard line, <b>but</b> <b>time</b> expired.|$|E

Brown started the season well, scoring 84 as Queensland amassed 501 against New South Wales. His old state were still 27 runs from making Queensland bat again, <b>but</b> <b>time</b> ran {{out with one}} wicket intact, with Brown yet to taste victory with his new state. Nevertheless, he continued to perform strongly as passed 50 {{in each of his}} first four innings. In the fourth of these, he was out for 99 and then declared at 5/510 to leave Victoria a victory target of 319. Brown then narrowly missed out on a milestone {{for the second time in}} the match when Victoria scraped home by three wickets to deny him a maiden victory with his home state. In the next match, he carried his bat to make an unbeaten 174 against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval, as his team fell to an innings defeat.|$|E

After the Eagles opened the lead to 21 points during time-on in the final quarter, Carlton kicked the last three goals of the game to narrow the margin to less than a goal; <b>but,</b> <b>time</b> expired, and West Coast won by three points.|$|E
