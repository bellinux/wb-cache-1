500|$|Hugh Montgomery of Q {{magazine}} {{noted that}} the singer's [...] "imaginative reach" [...] was [...] "complemented by a winning pop savviness", while Luke O'Neil from The Phoenix stated that [...] "he likes of Kate Nash and company have flitted through this piano siren/exuberant dance-diva territory, <b>but</b> <b>never</b> <b>mind,</b> because this gorgeous genre starts now." [...] Leonie Cooper from NME rated the album {{nine out of ten}} stars, finding flaw only in the titles of [...] "Shampain" [...] and [...] "Hermit the Frog".|$|E
500|$|The action resumed the {{following}} morning, with Howe closing on the French and then cutting through their line. Bellerophon followed Howe's flagship, the 100-gun , and sustained some damage from French fire. Howe isolated several French {{ships in the}} rear and pounded them with broadsides, but Villaret de Joyeuse {{was able to bring}} his van about to rescue them, and the two fleets parted again at night to reform their battle lines and repair damage. Poor weather on 30 May and 31 May prevented the fleets from making contact, but {{the following}} day, 1 June, Howe was able to bring about a decisive action, later known as the Glorious First of June. The British approached in line abreast, with Bellerophon {{at the end of the}} line. As they approached, the ships were heavily cannonaded by the French. Pasley was hit in the leg by a cannonball as he stood on the quarterdeck, with Midshipman Matthew Flinders reporting that [...] "our brave admiral lost his leg by an 18-pounder shot which came in through the barricadoes of the quarter-deck– it was in the heat of the action." [...] When two seamen expressed their sorrow, Pasley replied [...] "Thank you, <b>but</b> <b>never</b> <b>mind</b> my leg: take care of my flag." [...] He was taken below where the shattered leg was amputated. Captain Hope kept the ship in the engagement, pounding the 74-gun Éole until the French ship was forced out of the line. Bellerophon had by then lost all three topmasts, and her mainsail and lower shrouds had been cut to pieces. Hope then signalled the frigate [...] to tow the Bellerophon clear of the action. Despite being under heavy fire during the battle, Bellerophons casualties were comparatively light, amounting to four men killed and between twenty-seven and thirty wounded.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, well, well. I did {{not mean}} to speak about that. Things are {{unpacked}} easier than they are packed. <b>But,</b> however-- <b>Never</b> <b>mind.</b> Bell is to go with me this afternoon to Guestwick Manor. Let her be up here at two. Grimes can bring her box round, I suppose." ...|$|R
60|$|That third Herb Robert one is {{just the}} drawing that nobody <b>but</b> me (<b>never</b> <b>mind</b> grammar) could have made. Nobody! because it means ever so much careful {{watching}} of {{the ways of the}} leaf, and a lot of work in cramp perspective besides. It is not quite right yet, but it is nice.|$|R

60|$|Of course Old Cheeseman used to {{be called}} by the names of all sorts of cheeses--Double Glo'sterman, Family Cheshireman, Dutchman, North Wiltshireman, and all that. <b>But</b> he <b>never</b> <b>minded</b> it.

6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Emily, in a murmuring voice, 'we {{should do}} better if Lily {{would not make}} such a point of that one thing; <b>but</b> she <b>never</b> <b>minds</b> what else is cut short, and she never thinks of helping me.

6000|$|... “I {{should think}} so,” the sailor said warmly. “It {{was a fine}} thing to do, and I {{would be glad to}} do it myself. Stick to him, lad, as long as he will let you.

5000|$|The {{late 1990s}} saw the {{continuing}} of this {{revival of the}} fortunes for the surviving Wurzels, gaining a cult status amongst students and a resurgence in their popularity in their native West Country.

5000|$|A staunch patriot, Rajalakshmi was {{associated}} with the Freedom Movement and the Indian National Congress. To express her devotion to the cause, she produced a film India Thai.

Heavily mauled by the censors, this film fared badly at the box office but she did not mind the loss for her, rather she felt it was her contribution to the Freedom Movement.|$|R
