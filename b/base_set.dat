The kit issued to each team contains a <b>base</b> <b>set</b> of parts. Registration and the {{kit of parts}} together cost about US$6,000. In addition to that, teams are allowed to spend another $3,500 on their robot. The purpose of this rule is to lessen the influence of money on teams' competitiveness. Details of the game have been released on the first Saturday in January (except when that Saturday falls on January 1 or 2), and the teams have been given six weeks to construct a robot that can accomplish the game's tasks.|$|E
40|$|Anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> <b>based</b> on invex <b>set</b> and its related {{properties}} were researched, and anti-convex {{fuzzy set}} and some {{results in the}} related references were generalized. By applying thought of invex set to anti-convex fuzzy set, a new generalized anti-convex fuzzy set called anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> <b>based</b> on invex <b>set</b> was proposed. Let A∈F(Rn), andA is called Anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> <b>based</b> on invex <b>set,</b> whereη:Rn×Rn→Rn, and A(y+αη(x,y)) ≤A(x) ∨A(y),x,y∈Rn,α∈［ 0, 1 ］. Then, the relation between anti-convex fuzzy set and anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> <b>based</b> on invex <b>set</b> was discussed. If η(x,y) =x－y, then anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> <b>based</b> on invex <b>set</b> was degenerated into anti-convex fuzzy set, and obviously, anti-convex fuzzy set was made particular case of anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> <b>based</b> on invex <b>set.</b> Anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> <b>based</b> on invex <b>set</b> was not anti-convex fuzzy set by building an example, and anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> <b>based</b> on invex <b>set</b> was a true generalization of anti-convex fuzzy <b>set.</b> Thirdly, <b>based</b> on the definition of anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> <b>based</b> on invex <b>set,</b> the properties about the union and denseness of anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> <b>based</b> on invex <b>set</b> and the condition for fuzzy sets to be anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> <b>based</b> on invex <b>set</b> were studied. Lastly, similarly to ant-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> <b>based</b> on invex <b>set,</b> the conditions for fuzzy set to be strongly anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> <b>based</b> on invex <b>set</b> and strictly anti-convex fuzzy <b>set</b> <b>based</b> on invex <b>set</b> fuzzy sets were respectively studied...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new class of}} clique separators, called <b>base</b> <b>sets,</b> for chordal graphs. <b>Base</b> <b>sets</b> of a chordal graph closely reflect its structure. We show that the notion of <b>base</b> <b>sets</b> leads to structural characterizations of planar k-trees and planar chordal graphs. Using these characterizations, we develop linear time algorithms for recognizing planar k-trees and planar chordal graphs. These algorithms are extensions of the Lexicographic_Breadth_First_Search algorithm for recognizing chordal graphs and are much simpler than the general planarity checking algorithm. Further, we use the notion of <b>base</b> <b>sets</b> to prove the equivalence of hamiltonian 2 -trees and maximal outerplanar graphs...|$|R

25|$|Often a poset {{comes with}} a natural {{candidate}} for a rank function; for instance if its elements are finite subsets of some <b>base</b> <b>set</b> B, one can take the number of elements of those subsets. Then the criterion just given can be more practical than the definition because it avoids mention of covers. For instance if B is itself a poset, and P consists of its finite lower sets (subsets for which with every one of its elements, all smaller elements {{are also in the}} subset), then the criterion is automatically satisfied, since for lower sets xnbsp&⊂nbsp&z there is always a maximal element of z that is absent from x, and it can be removed from z to form y.|$|E
25|$|The {{dimension}} of physical quantities {{of interest in}} mechanics can be {{expressed in terms of}} base dimensions M, L, and T – these form a 3-dimensional vector space. This is not the only valid choice of base dimensions, but it is the one most commonly used. For example, one might choose force, length and mass as the base dimensions (as some have done), with associated dimensions F, L, M; this corresponds to a different basis, and one may convert between these representations by a change of basis. The choice of the <b>base</b> <b>set</b> of dimensions is thus a convention, with the benefit of increased utility and familiarity. The choice of base dimensions is not arbitrary, because the dimensions must form a basis: they must span the space, and be linearly independent.|$|E

As the British ships were leaving the vicinity of Narvik they encountered five German destroyers at close range. Two of the German ships crossed the T of the British ships and quickly set [...] on fire and forced her to run aground.
