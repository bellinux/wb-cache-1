5|$|Historically, many {{prospective}} Australian uranium mines {{have been}} constrained by active antinuclear opposition, <b>but</b> <b>state</b> governments have now approved mine development in Western Australia and Queensland. But {{it is unlikely}} that any new projects will enter active development until the market improves. As of 2013 uranium prices are very low. Cameco placed the Kintyre project on hold until market prices improve and Paladin has stated that its project proposals (Bigrlyi, Angela/Pamela, Manyingee, Oobagooma, and Valhalla/Skal) need higher uranium market prices before they can proceed. Toro wants to take the Wiluna proposal to the development phase, but has not been successful in attracting equity investors. When market prices go up again, so that mine development is justified, most projects would need at least five years to proceed to production.|$|E

25|$|In 1977 a 22-story {{high-rise}} Capitol building {{designed by}} architect Edward Durell Stone was completed, {{which is now}} the third-tallest state capitol building in the United States. In 1978 the old capitol, {{directly in front of}} the new capitol, was scheduled for demolition, <b>but</b> <b>state</b> officials decided to keep the Old Capitol as a museum.|$|E

25|$|Among Keating's other accomplishments; {{overseeing}} the largest road construction project in Oklahoma history and leading his state through devastating tornadoes in 1999. As a crowning achievement, Keating {{raised more than}} $20 million in private money towards completion of the Oklahoma State Capitol with a dome. The capitol was originally designed for a dome, <b>but</b> <b>state</b> funding for it had run dry during World War I.|$|E
25|$|From 1975, Australian National {{provided}} full sitting carriages west of Port Pirie on two journeys per week. The New South Wales Government Railways initially resisted providing sitting accommodation {{over the}} whole journey, <b>but</b> <b>State</b> Rail Authority HUB/RUB sitting carriages were included between Sydney and Port Pirie from 1980, with Australian National providing sitting carriages further west. Sitting carriages provided by Australian National {{became part of the}} full through service from Sydney to Perth in 1988.|$|E
25|$|The Olmsted Brothers Firm of Brookline, Massachusetts, {{designed}} the current campus around 1921 when LSU {{was planning to}} move its campus from downtown Baton Rouge. The Olmsted firm originally {{designed the}} campus for up to 3,000 students, <b>but</b> <b>state</b> officials asked the firm to scale the plan back due to budgetary constraints; subsequently, the new plan presented to the state by the Olmsted Brothers centered the campus around a cruciform quadrangle {{similar to the one}} that exists on campus today.|$|E

25|$|By August 1934, the Virginia State Highway Commission {{was still}} working on obtaining {{rights-of-way}} for the Lee Boulevard route. The state believed {{it was close to}} completing this process, however, and construction on the roadway would begin soon. Minor delays were encountered in October 1934 while the state resurveyed {{a small portion of the}} route in order to avoid condemnation of a large and expensive home, <b>but</b> <b>state</b> highway officials said they were likely to issue bids for construction by the end of November.|$|E
25|$|Predictions of {{the lake}} being over-fished in 1895 were premature, since the fishery has survived {{commercial}} and sport fishing, pollution {{in the middle of}} the 20th century, invasive species and other ailments, <b>but</b> <b>state</b> and provincial governments, as well as national governments, have played a greater role as time went by. Business boomed; in 1901, the Carnegie Company proposed building a new harbor near Erie in Elk Creek to accommodate shipments from its tube-plant site nearby. In 1913, a memorial to Commodore Perry was built on Put-in-Bay island featuring a Doric column.|$|E
25|$|Education as Rettungsassistent {{was mostly}} offered by privately owned <b>but</b> <b>state</b> {{certified}} EMS schools (Rettungsassistenten-Schule). Mostly {{the students had}} to pay for their own training, rarely a future employer paid. Usual exceptions were firefighters, policemen and members of the armed forces for whom their employer covered the fees. Costs depended on school, they varied around €4000 for a full course. With a pre-existing EMS training, a shortened course was available, for fees of about €2750. Side entry for nurses were possible, omitting several medical topics, remaining fees of about €1800. Public funding and sponsorship were possible in certain cases.|$|E

25|$|After the {{collapse}} of the bridge's predecessor, Mn/DOT announced to potential contractors that they should express their intention to bid on the project by August 8, 2007. A typical bridge project of this scale in Minnesota would be expected to take three years to complete, <b>but</b> <b>state</b> transportation officials hoped to open this replacement bridge in 15 months by using a design/build contract that allowed design and construction of the bridge to proceed concurrently. Mn/DOT announced on August 9 that five companies/consortia had been approved to bid on the project and requested that the bids be submitted by September 18, 2007.|$|E
25|$|The cotton regime {{ended by}} the 1950s. As {{factories}} were built across the state, {{the great majority}} of farmers left agriculture. Service industries, such as tourism, education and medical care, grew rapidly, as the textile factories faded after 1970 with movement of jobs offshore. By 2000, the white majority of South Carolina voted solidly Republican in presidential elections, <b>but</b> <b>state</b> and local government elections were contested by the two parties. The population continued to grow, reaching 4 million in 2000, as coast areas became prime locations for tourists and retirees. The poverty rate of 13.5% is slightly worse than the national average of 11.7%.|$|E
25|$|The equal-field system, {{which had}} {{formed the basis}} of {{agriculture}} for the past two and a half centuries, began to collapse after the An Shi Rebellion. The equal-field system had relied on the state having large amounts of land, <b>but</b> <b>state</b> landholdings had decreased as they were privatised or granted to peasants. Landowners perpetually enlarging their estates exacerbated the collapse. The Fubing system, in which soldiers served the army and farmed on equal-field land was abolished and replaced with the Mubing system, which relied on a volunteer and standing army. In 780, the Tang government discontinued the equal field system and reorganised the tax system, collecting taxes based on property value twice a year, in spring and autumn.|$|E

25|$|The {{growing number}} of Protestants, Evangelicals and Word of God Catholics {{challenging}} traditional authority has caused religious strife {{in a number of}} indigenous communities. Tensions have been strong, at times, especially in rural areas such as San Juan Chamula. Tension among the groups reached its peak in the 1990s with {{a large number of people}} injured during open clashes. In the 1970s, caciques began to expel dissidents from their communities for challenging their power, initially with the use of violence. By 2000, more than 20,000 people had been displaced, <b>but</b> <b>state</b> and federal authorities did not act to stop the expulsions. Today, the situation has quieted but the tension remains, especially in very isolated communities.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1970s, Dixmont {{had reached}} {{financial}} crisis {{due to the}} state's desire {{to shut down the}} hospital. As the concept of deinstitutionalization and use of Thorazine progressed, large state institutions were becoming obsolete and patient numbers decreased rapidly. With the patients' rights movement, they were no longer allowed to work for profit, something which had previously generated the hospital revenue. Many of the buildings were in need of renovation, <b>but</b> <b>state</b> funding was scarce. By 1983, several floors of Reed Hall were empty and unused buildings such as the canteen and men's annex were demolished to prevent fire hazards. In July 1984, the hospital was closed down and the 300 remaining patients were transferred to nearby institutions.|$|E
25|$|While {{his home}} in Earlysville {{was placed in the}} 5th District, {{represented}} by Lewis F. Payne, Jr., most of his district was placed in the newly redrawn 10th district, represented by fellow Republican Frank Wolf. Allen moved to Mount Vernon and prepared to challenge Wolf in a primary. <b>But</b> <b>state</b> Republican leaders had {{let it be known that}} he could not expect any support for his planned run for governor in 1993 if he made such a challenge. Allen decided not to run in either district. After Democratic U.S. Rep. James Olin of the 6th district decided to retire, there was speculation Allen could run there. But he decided not to move his family and run in the 6th district either.|$|E
