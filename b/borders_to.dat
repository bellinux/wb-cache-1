5|$|According to Luttwak, {{the forward}} defence system was always {{vulnerable}} to unusually large barbarian concentrations of forces, as the Roman army was too thinly spread along the enormous <b>borders</b> <b>to</b> {{deal with such}} threats. In addition, {{the lack of any}} reserves {{to the rear of the}} border entailed that a barbarian force that successfully penetrated the perimeter defences would have unchallenged ability to rampage deep into the empire before Roman reinforcements from other border garrisons could arrive to intercept them.|$|E
5|$|Again {{unable to}} get his {{expanded}} gambling proposal past the Senate, Beshear attempted to chip away at the Republican majority in that chamber by appointing some Republican senators to lucrative positions in the executive and judicial branches {{in advance of the}} 2010 General Assembly. Shortly after the special session, Beshear named Republican senator Charlie <b>Borders</b> <b>to</b> the state Public Safety Commission. That appointment set up a special election for Borders' seat, which was won by Democratic senator Robin Webb, reducing the Republican majority to 20–17 with one Independent who usually voted with the Republicans. Following Webb's victory, Beshear appointed Republican senator Dan Kelly to a circuit judgeship, but Republicans held on to that seat in a special election.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{suffrage}} {{movement in}} Wales attempted {{to show a}} level of independence, it was always following rather than leading a national agenda. It depended deeply in its embryonic years on celebrated suffragists from outside its <b>borders</b> <b>to</b> bring crowds to town meetings, but still relied on a network of now forgotten non-militant supporters who organised and campaigned on the ground level. And, although failing to significantly draw a rural Welsh-speaking heartland to its cause, it still embraced a national sense of pride and values that contrasted to their neighbours in England.|$|E

5|$|As Minister of Education, ML Pin {{established}} the Regional Education Development Project including higher education, which aimed {{to study the}} needs and limitations of education systems in the provinces. Spanning over two years, results of the project included the improvement of cooperation between government officials and Muslim locals in the four southernmost provinces, recognition {{of the need for}} children living near the Malay and Cambodian <b>borders</b> <b>to</b> be able to learn the Thai language before starting school, and the experimental development of a curriculum based on learners' needs and interests at Suranaree School.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} phases, British and Malaysian troops had {{attempted}} only {{to control the}} border, and to protect population centres. However, {{by the time the}} Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action, crossing <b>borders</b> <b>to</b> obtain information and forcing the Indonesians to remain on the defensive, under the codename Operation Claret. The fighting took place in mountainous, jungle-clad terrain, and a debilitating climate, with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border, cross-border operations, the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply, and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine Indonesian movements and intentions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} quarter, a snap {{went over the}} head of punter Brian <b>Borders</b> <b>to</b> give Miami {{possession}} at the Toledo 21-yard line. However, a goal line stand by the Rockets' defense kept the Redskins out of the endzone on a failed fourth-and-one running play. In the fourth quarter, Miami scored the final points of the game on a five-yard Terry Carter touchdown run to make the final score 20–14. The victory improved Toledo's all-time record against Miami to 16–22.|$|E

5|$|That conquest was a {{consequence}} of the Augustan imperative of securing the Imperial <b>borders.</b> <b>To</b> effectively control the Alps as the shield of northern Italy, Rome needed to control both flanks of the mountain range. Thus it had to extend its power to the Rhine and Danube, thereby also opening a direct route to Germania and all of Central Europe. The last obstacle in this path were the Raetians. After a first expedition against them by Publius Silius Nerva in 16BC, a more thorough campaign by Drusus and the later emperor Tiberius brought Raetia – and thereby all of Switzerland – firmly under Roman control.|$|E
5|$|The Parthian Empire had no {{standing}} army, yet {{were able}} to quickly recruit troops {{in the event of}} local crises. There was a permanent armed guard attached to the person of the king, comprising nobles, serfs and mercenaries, but this royal retinue was small. Garrisons were also permanently maintained at border forts; Parthian inscriptions reveal some of the military titles granted to the commanders of these locations. Military forces could also be used in diplomatic gestures. For example, when Chinese envoys visited Parthia in the late 2nd century BC, the Shiji maintains that 20,000 horsemen were sent to the eastern <b>borders</b> <b>to</b> serve as escorts for the embassy, although this figure is perhaps an exaggeration.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{force was}} superior, but faced severe {{logistical}} problems. Count Paskevich's army {{was too big}} to sustain on food confiscated from captured lands. It relied on provisions transported from Russia, either directly through Polish territory or theoretically neutral Prussia. The epidemic of cholera brought to Poland and East Prussia by Russian soldiers forced the Prussian authorities to close their <b>borders</b> <b>to</b> Russian transports. To avoid starving his army, Paskevich ordered two permanent bridges built across the Vistula, in Góra and Podgórze. Only the latter one had been completed {{by the start of}} the Russian assault of Warsaw.|$|E

In northern Illinois, ComEd (a division of Exelon) operates the greatest number of nuclear generating plants in any US state. Because of this, ComEd reports indicate that Chicago receives about 75% of its electricity from nuclear power. Recently, the city began installing wind turbines on government buildings to promote renewable energy.|$|R

5|$|The senior King died on 3 May 1270. His daughter, Anna, {{seized the}} royal {{treasury}} and fled to Bohemia. Henry Kőszegi, Nicholas Geregye, and Lawrence AbaBéla's closest advisorsfollowed her {{and handed over}} Kőszeg, Borostyánkő (Bernstein, Austria) and their other castles along the western <b>borders</b> <b>to</b> Ottokar II. Instead of leaving Hungary, Nicholas Hahót garrisoned Styrian soldiers in his fort at Pölöske, and made plundering raids against the nearby villages. Stephen nominated his own partisans to the highest offices; for instance, Joachim Gutkeled became Ban of Slavonia, and Matthew Csák was appointed Voivode of Transylvania. Stephen granted Esztergom County to Archbishop Philip who crowned him king in Esztergom on or after 17 May.|$|E
5|$|After the Armistice on the Western Front, Lenin {{believed}} that the breakout of European revolution was imminent. Seeking to promote this, Sovnarkom supported the establishment of Béla Kun's communist government in Hungary in March 1919, followed by the communist government in Bavaria and various revolutionary socialist uprisings {{in other parts of}} Germany, including that of the Spartacus League. During Russia's Civil War, the Red Army was sent into the newly independent national republics on Russia's <b>borders</b> <b>to</b> aid Marxists there in establishing soviet systems of government. In Europe, this resulted in the creation of new communist-led states in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine, all of which were officially independent of Russia, while further east it {{led to the creation of}} communist governments in Georgia, and then in Outer Mongolia. Various senior Bolsheviks wanted these absorbed into the Russian state; Lenin insisted that national sensibilities should be respected, but reassured his comrades that these nations' new Communist Party administrations were under the de facto authority of Sovnarkom.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{economic}} integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's <b>borders</b> <b>to</b> {{trade in the}} automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns over energy self-sufficiency and foreign ownership in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program (NEP) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA). In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage foreign investment. The Canada– United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, {{detailed}} invasion {{plans were}} {{drawn up by}} the Germans, but Switzerland was never attacked. Switzerland was able to remain independent {{through a combination of}} military deterrence, concessions to Germany, and good fortune as larger events during the war delayed an invasion. Under General Henri Guisan central command, a general mobilisation of the armed forces was ordered. The Swiss military strategy was changed from one of static defence at the <b>borders</b> <b>to</b> protect the economic heartland, to one of organised long-term attrition and withdrawal to strong, well-stockpiled positions high in the Alps known as the Reduit. Switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the Axis and Allied powers.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Sikorski {{supported}} the Polish–Soviet rapprochement, which reignited {{criticism of his}} person from some Polish factions. Nonetheless, Sikorski soon realized that the Soviet Union had plans for Polish territories, which would be unacceptable to Polish public. The Soviets began their diplomatic offensive after their first major military victory in the Battle of Moscow, and intensified this policy after the battle of Stalingrad, showing less and less regard for their deals with Poland. In January 1942 British diplomat Stafford Cripps informed General Sikorski that while Stalin planned to extend Polish <b>borders</b> <b>to</b> the west, by giving Poland Germany's East Prussia, he also wanted to considerably push Poland's eastern frontier westwards, {{along the lines of}} the Versailles concept of the Curzon Line, and acquire Lwów and Wilno, if not both. Sikorksi's stance on eastern borders was not inflexible; he noted in some documents that some concessions might be acceptable, however, giving up both Lwów and Wilno was not.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Independence Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo 6 c. 30) {{passed by}} the Parliament of the United Kingdom divided British India into the two new {{independent}} dominions; the Dominion of India (later to become the Republic of India) and the Dominion of Pakistan (later to become the Islamic Republic of Pakistan). The act provided a mechanism for division of the Bengal and Punjab provinces {{between the two nations}} (see partition of India), establishment of the office of the Governor-General, conferral of complete legislative authority upon the respective Constituent Assemblies, and division of joint property between the two new countries. The act later received royal assent on 18 July 1947. The partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties, and the displacement of nearly 15 million people due to religious violence across the subcontinent; millions of Muslim, Sikh and Hindu refugees trekked the newly drawn <b>borders</b> <b>to</b> Pakistan and India respectively in the months surrounding independence. On 14 August 1947, the new Dominion of Pakistan became independent and Muhammad Ali Jinnah was sworn in as its first governor general in Karachi. Independence was marked with widespread celebration, but the atmosphere remained heated given the communal riots prevalent during independence in 1947.|$|E
