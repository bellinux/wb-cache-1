60|$|The sagacious reader, deeply read in {{this kind}} of {{judicial}} combats, can imagine the encounter of the graceless nephew and the stranger knight. He sees their concussion, man to man, and horse to horse, in mid career, and Sir Graceless hurled to the ground and slain. He will not wonder that the assailants of the brawny uncles were less successful in their rude encounter; but he will picture to himself the stout stranger spurring to their rescue, in the very critical moment; he will see him transfixing one with his lance, and cleaving the other to the chine with a <b>back</b> <b>stroke</b> of his sword, thus leaving the trio of accusers dead upon the field, and establishing the immaculate fidelity of the duchess, and her title to the dukedom, beyond the shadow of a doubt.|$|E

But resistance against such odds was vain. By sheer weight of numbers, Ned was borne to the ground. His arms were then pinioned with stout ropes made of the fibres of the boobooda tree. With shrieks of exultation the savages dragged our hero to an opening in the woods where a huge fire was burning, over which was suspended an enormous caldron of bubbling oil. 'Boil him, boil him,' yelled the savages, now wrought to the point of frenzy." ...|$|E

60|$|And here I would premise {{one great}} advantage, which, as historian, I possess over my reader; and this it is, that though I cannot {{save the life}} of my {{favorite}} hero, nor absolutely contradict the event of a battle (both which liberties, though often taken by the French writers of the present reign, I hold to be utterly unworthy of a scrupulous historian), yet I can now and then make him bestow on his enemy a sturdy <b>back</b> <b>stroke</b> sufficient to fell a giant; though, in honest truth, he may never have done anything of the kind; or I can drive his antagonist clear round and round the field, as did Homer make that fine fellow Hector scamper like a poltroon round the walls of Troy; for which, if ever they have encountered one another in the Elysian Fields, I'll warrant the prince of poets has had to make the most humble apology.|$|E
6000|$|... 202. I {{had gone}} into the Museum that day to see the exact form of a duck's wing, the {{examination}} of a lively young drake's here at Coniston having closed in his giving me such a cut on the wrist with it, that I could scarcely write all the morning afterwards. Now in the whole bird gallery there are only two ducks' wings expanded, and those in different positions. Fancy the difference to the mob, and me, if the shells and monkey skeletons were taken away from the mid-gallery, and instead, three gradated series of birds put down the length of it (or half the length--or a quarter would do it--with judgment), showing the transition, in length of beak, from bunting to woodcock--in length of leg, from swift to stilted plover--and in length of wing, from auk to frigate-bird; the wings, all opened, in one specimen of each bird to their full sweep, and in another, shown at the limit of the down <b>back</b> <b>stroke.</b> For what on earth--or in air--is the use to me of seeing their boiled sternums and scalped sinciputs, when I'm never shown either how they bear their breasts--or where they carry their heads? ...|$|E
6000|$|A gondola is {{in general}} rowed only by one man, {{standing}} at the stern; those of the upper classes having two or more boatmen, for greater speed and magnificence. In order to raise the oar sufficiently, it rests, not {{on the side of}} the boat, but on a piece of crooked timber like the branch of a tree, rising about a foot from the boat's side, and called a [...] "fórcola." [...] The fórcola is of different forms, according to the size and uses of the boat, and it is always somewhat complicated in its parts and curvature, allowing the oar various kinds of rests and catches on both its sides, but perfectly free play in all cases; as the management of the boat depends on the gondolier's being able in an instant to place his oar in any position. The fórcola is set on the right-hand side of the boat, some six feet from the stern: the gondolier stands on a little flat platform or deck behind it, and throws nearly the entire weight of his body upon the forward stroke. The effect of this stroke would be naturally to turn the boat's head round to the left, as well as to send it forward; but this tendency is corrected by keeping the blade of the oar under the water on the return stroke, and raising it gradually, as a full spoon is raised out of any liquid, so that the blade emerges from the water only an instant before it again plunges. A downward and lateral pressure upon the fórcola is thus obtained, which entirely counteracts the tendency given by the forward stroke; and the effort, after a little practice, becomes hardly conscious, though, as it adds some labor to the <b>back</b> <b>stroke,</b> rowing a gondola at speed is hard and breathless work, though it appears easy and graceful to the looker-on.|$|E

6000|$|The boat being thus guided, the cry [...] "Premi" [...] is {{the order}} from one gondolier to another {{that he should}} [...] "press" [...] or thrust forward his oar, without the <b>back</b> <b>stroke,</b> so as to send the boat's head round to the left; and the cry [...] "Stali" [...] is the order that he should give the return or upward stroke which sends the boat's head round to the right. Hence, if two gondoliers meet under any {{circumstances}} which render it a matter of question on which side they should pass each other, the gondolier who has {{at the moment the}} least power over his boat, cries to the other, [...] "Premi," [...] if he wishes the boats to pass with their right-hand sides to each other, and [...] "Stali," [...] if with their left. Now, in turning a corner, there is of course risk of collision between boats coming from opposite sides, and warning is always clearly and loudly given on approaching an angle of the canals. It is of course presumed that the boat which gives the warning will be nearer the turn than the one which receives and answers it; and therefore will not have so much time to check itself or alter its course. Hence the advantage of the turn, that is, the outside, which allows the fullest swing and greatest room for lee-way, is always yielded to the boat which gives warning. Therefore, if the warning boat is going to turn to the right, as it is to have the outside position, it will keep its own right-hand side to the boat which it meets, and the cry of warning is therefore [...] "Premi," [...] twice given; first as soon as it can be heard round the angle, prolonged and loud, with the accent on the e, and another strongly accented e added, a kind of question, [...] "Prémi-é," [...] followed at the instant of turning, with [...] "Ah Premí," [...] with the accent sharp on the final i. If, on the other hand, the warning boat is going to turn to the left, it will pass with its left-hand side to the one it meets; and the warning cry is, [...] "Stáli-é, Ah Stalí." [...] Hence the confused idea {{in the mind of the}} traveller that Stali means [...] "to the left," [...] and [...] "Premi" [...] to the right; while they mean, in reality, the direct reverse; the Stali, for instance, being the order to the unseen gondolier who may be behind the corner, coming from the left-hand side, that he should hold as much as possible to his own right; this being the only safe order for him, whether he is going to turn the corner himself, or to go straight on; for as the warning gondola will always swing right across the canal in turning, a collision with it is only to be avoided by keeping well within it, and close up to the corner which it turns.|$|E
