40|$|Despite {{the wide}} usage of hollow retroreflectors, {{there is limited}} {{literature}} involving their fabrication techniques and only two documented construction methods could be found. One consists of an adjustable fixture that allows for the independent alignment of each mirror, while the other consists of a modified solid retroreflector that {{is used as a}} mandrel. Although both methods were shown to produce hollow retroreflectors with arcsecond dihedral angle errors, a comparison and analysis of each method could not be found which makes it difficult to ascertain which method would be better suited to use for precision-aligned retroreflectors. Although epoxy bonding is generally the preferred method to adhere the three mirrors, a relatively new method known as hydroxide-catalysis bonding (HCB) presents several potential advantages over epoxy bonding. HCB has been used to bond several optical components for space-based missions, but has never been applied for construction of hollow retroreflectors. In this paper we examine the benefits and limitations of each <b>bonding</b> <b>fixture</b> as well as present results and analysis of hollow retroreflectors made using both epoxy and HCB techniques...|$|E
40|$|Thermoreversible gels {{have the}} unique ability to self-heal, or repair themselves, {{once they are}} fractured. They are {{physically}} cross-linked, thus providing them with the capability to reform their broken bonds {{as a function of}} temperature. The objective of this project is {{to determine the extent of}} the gels’ recovery. If self-healing does in fact occur, these gels can be applied in various industries, including medicine for drug delivery or paints and coatings. The tri-block polymer poly(methyl methacrylate) -poly(n-butyl acrylate) -poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA-PnBA-PMMA) was heated and stirred with 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol to create a polymer gel. Through the use of a rheometer, a shear stress was applied to fracture the <b>bonds.</b> The <b>fixture</b> was then oscillated to gently probe the polymer gel at 28 °C, 25 °C, 23 °C, and 21 °C. This data was compared to the unfractured gel to determine the degree of recovery. It was found that the bonds did, indeed, reform, as over 100 % recovery was presented in the storage modulus for all four temperatures and in the loss modulus at 23 °C and 21 °C. However, the plane of fracture is in question. The exact location of the fractured gel hasn’t been found, thus to determine exactly how much has been fractured, the applied shear stress time can be extended. Other further experimentation includes using a rheo-PIV (particle image velocimetry) system to properly determine whether the rheometer recorded the fractured or original gel...|$|R
40|$|A {{photograph}} and a block {{diagram of the}} high-temperature probe station are shown. The system consists of the ceramic heater mounted on a NASA shuttle tile insulator, a direct current power supply, a personal-computer-based data acquisition and temperature controller, microwave probes, a microscope, and a network analyzer. The ability to perform microwave tests at high temperatures is becoming necessary. There is now a need for sensors and communication circuits that can operate at 500 C and above for aircraft engine development and monitoring during flight. To address this need, researchers have fabricated devices using wide bandgap semiconductors such as SiC with targeted operating temperatures of 500 to 600 C. However, the microwave properties of these devices often change drastically with temperature, so any designs that are intended {{to be used in}} such an environment must be characterized at high temperatures. For some reliability, lifetime, and direct-current testing, the device under test can be packaged and characterized in an oven. However, for RF and microwave measurements, it is usually not possible to establish a calibrated reference plane at the device terminals within a package. In addition, the characteristics of the package would vary over a 500 C temperature range, and this would have to be accounted for when the data were analyzed. A high temperature probe station allows circuits and devices to be characterized through on wafer measurements across a broad temperature range with known reference plane. The conventional, commercially available thermal wafer-probe stations that are used to evaluate microwave devices across a controlled temperature range have a typical upper limit of 200 C. Standalone thermal heating chucks are available with an extended upper temperature range of 300 to 400 C. To effectively characterize devices at temperatures up to and surpassing 500 C, Glenn researchers developed a custom probe station. In the past, custom probe stations have been developed to test devices under other extreme environments, such as cryogenic temperatures as low as 37 K. Similarly, this custom probe station was specifically modified for high-temperature use. It allows devices to be measured quickly and flexibly, without the use of wire <b>bonds</b> and test <b>fixtures.</b> The probe station is shown making scattering parameter measurements from 1 to 50 GHz with a Hewlett-Packard 8510 C Network Analyzer. There is a half-wafer of silicon directly on top of the heater to provide a uniform heated platform for our sample. A quarter wafer of silicon carbide forms the substrate for our test circuit of several transmission lines...|$|R
