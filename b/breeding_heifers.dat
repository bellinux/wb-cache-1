The median herd dystocia rate was 5. 8 % and 24. 4 % of herds had no dystocias. The median herd stillbirth rate was 2. 8 %, and 33. 3 % of herds had no stillbirths. Dystocias and stillbirths were much more common in heifers than in cows. Separate statistical models of dystocia and stillbirth for cows and heifers were created. Dystocia in cows was associated with calf sex, previous calving assistance and large breed type and birth weight. Variations in 1987 cow herd dystocia rates were associated with calving season, location and density, and the herd dystocia rate in 1986.

A longitudinal study was carried out between February 1999 and November 2001 in seven commercial dairy farms in Argentina using 1535 lactating cows. Time-interval parameters were analysed using a parametric survival model with shared frailty, time until infection was analysed using a Bayesian interval-censoring survival model and the infection transmission parameter (ß) was estimated by a generalized linear model. The reproduction ratio (R 0) was calculated. In total, 1000 cows tested positive and 494 tested negative. The predicted median age at infection was 4 · 6 years for seroconverted cows.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that, in Switzerland, {{communal}} grazing of livestock on alpine pastures {{plays an important role}} in the spread of BVD virus. Analogously, we might expect that the communal raising on farms specialising in raising heifers of animals born on different farms would also favour the spread of BVDV. This study investigated whether a persistently infected (PI) <b>breeding</b> <b>heifer</b> kept on this type of farm over a period of 26 months would put the other animals at risk of being infected. The PI-animal was in contact with 75 heifers (here defined as contact animals) on this farm. Thirty-two of the contact animals that were probably pregnant (animals at risk of giving birth to a PI-calf) were moved to 8 different breeding farms (here defined as farms at risk). On these 8 farms, 246 calves were found to be at risk of being infected with BVDV. We examined 78 calves and investigated whether the move of the pregnant animals from their original farm had permitted the virus to spread to these 8 other farms. The contact animals had a seroprevalence of 92 % and the animals at risk a seroprevalence of 100 %. Only one PI-animal was found on the farms at risk. This BVD infection, however, occurred independently of the PI-breeding animal. Seropositive calves were found only on 2 farms. This study did not provide any proof for a spread of BVDV with the PI-breeding animal as a source; likewise, no persistent infection was proven to exist on the farms at risk. This result is likely to be representative for the endemic situation of BVD in Switzerland. Thus, PI-animals present on heifer raising farms infect calves well before servicing. Hence, no new PI-animals are generated, and the infection becomes self-limiting. When we reconstructed the animal movements between the farms and determined the animals to be examined with the aid of the Swiss national animal traffic database (TVD) we found the data of 37 % of the heifers to be incomplete and failed to successfully establish the whereabouts of 3 animals...|$|R

Longevity data were collected on 2, 195 heifers from producers in South Dakota Integrated Resource Management groups. Longevity and weaning weight data were collected on 16, 549 individual heifers at the U. S. Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC).

Heifers that calved with their first calf during the first 21 -d period of the calving season had increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) longevity compared with heifers that calved in the second 21 -d period, or later. Average longevity for South Dakota heifers that calved in the first or later period was 5. 1 ± 0. 1 and 3. 9 ± 0. 1 yr, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT Aiming at <b>breeding</b> <b>heifers</b> with 14 - 15 {{months of}} age, 100 Hereford calves were {{subjected}} to different feeding systems. Heifers grazed on a natural pasture in early winter, fed or not a supplement (14 % crude protein; 72 % total digestible nutrients), were transferred to a ryegrass pasture for 73 days, {{and then returned to}} a natural pasture for 15 days until the beginning of the breeding season. During the last 15 days on ryegrass pasture and the 15 days of the return to the natural pasture, half of the heifers of the two previous systems were offered the supplement, thereby establishing four feeding treatments. Heifers supplemented during the second period, independently of supplementation during the first grazing period, presented higher average daily gain and greater backfat values than the non-supplemented heifers. The breeding season extended for 75 days. At the start of the breeding season (November 18), heifers supplemented during both periods presented higher body condition score and body weight. The highest percentage of puberty was determined in heifers supplemented in the early winter. Heifers supplemented during both periods presented the highest pregnancy rate. Pregnant heifers presented higher average daily gain when fed the supplement during the second period, as well as higher relative pelvic area, body weight, and body condition score at the start and end of the breeding season. To an expressive pregnancy in 14 - to 15 - month-old heifers, higher weaning weights and pasture allowance are required to get a better answer to supplements offered...|$|E

Short, moderate, and long postpartum intervals were used to reflect differences in reproductive performance. In addition, replacement heifers were bred beginning either 3 wk ahead of the cow herd or {{at the same time as}} the cow herd. Fifty-four simulations were generated. Inputs into the economic model were herd performance, livestock and feed prices, nonfeed costs, and feed requirements for 1 yr of production.

Net income was greatest with 704 breeding seasons when the postpartum interval was short or moderate. When the postpartum interval was long, net income was greatest with 1204 breeding seasons because pregnancy rates, as a result of the long breeding season, were highest and feed costs were lowest for thin cows.

The definitive version is available at [URL] Copyright: ElsevierA simulation showed that calving heifers {{for the first time at}} two compared with three years of age increased profitability of a beef breeding herd; however, profitability of calving two-year-old heifers was dependent on the incidence of assistance at parturition. The predominant cause of dystocia (and hence assistance at parturition) in beef <b>breeding</b> <b>heifers</b> is feto-maternal disproportion. This condition could be alleviated by reducing birth weight of calves relative to live weight of heifers. In a survey of farmers, 20 % of those currently calving heifers at three years of age indicated that if the need for assistance at parturition was eliminated, they would calve their heifers at two years of age. In two surveys conducted of the same farmers in consecutive years, mean incidence of assistance at parturition in primiparous, two-year-old heifers was 7. 0 % and 9. 5 %, and reached 100 % in some herds. Mortality rate by four weeks postpartum was 30 % for assisted calves and 11 % for assisted heifers. Methods of reducing the need for assistance at parturition in primiparous, two-year-old, beef <b>breeding</b> <b>heifers</b> would be of value to the beef cattle industry in New Zealand. The objective of this research was to identify whether manipulation of liveweight gain of primiparous, two-year-old, Angus heifers in the first trimester of pregnancy could be used to regulate birth weight of calves, and to identify factors contributing to the need for assistance at parturition. Three experiments were conducted in which heifers were fed for various rates of liveweight gain: 1. moderate versus low for the first trimester of pregnancy; 2. a 2 x 2 factorial experiment in which liveweight gain was 1220 high versus moderate for ten days prior to insemination, and moderate versus a loss for the first trimester of pregnancy; 3. high and moderate, moderate and a loss, or moderate and moderate for days 0 - 42 and 42 - 90 of pregnancy, respectively. Birth weight of calves was not affected by treatment in experiments 1 and 3. In experiment 2, birth weight of the calf relative to live weight of the heifer was least in the high-then-low treatment, but subsequent live weight of those calves was also less, partially negating any potential benefits to production. An additional experiment revealed similar fetal weight at the end of the first trimester for heifers that had moderate or low liveweight gain from 21 days prior to conception. Probability of assistance at parturition increased with birth weight of the calf and decreased with increased live weight of the heifer. Body dimensions of calves did not affect the likelihood of assistance. Assistance had no effect on subsequent performance of surviving animals. Manipulation of liveweight gain of heifers in the first trimester of pregnancy did not offer a means of reliably regulating birth weight of calves; however, the impact of assistance at calving did not justify delaying first calving until three years of age. Birth weight and assistance at calving can currently be best managed through selection of appropriate service sires for primiparous heifers...|$|E
40|$|By tradition, the {{scramble}} heifer {{program has}} been portrayed as a strong animal project for which youth participate. These projects are yearlong; require a time commitment, monetary support, and dedication from the students. Animal science projects are well known for teaching life skills such as leadership, communication, working with groups, making decisions, and work ethic. Therefore, this study was developed to determine the life skills gained and the educational influence youth acquire {{as a result of}} raising a <b>breeding</b> <b>heifer</b> from the scramble program and the associated economic costs. The development of a participant questionnaire was used to address the above aforementioned purpose. The questionnaire was developed by Dr. Chris Boleman and the researcher, in conjunction with the Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo. The questionnaire was administered via (web) mailing techniques through the assistance of the Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo. The census included 400 calf scramble participants for the years 2005, 2006, and 2007. The survey consisted of 60 items and included scales on demographics, life skills obtained, management of project, and educational and/or career goals questions. Conclusions showed that the calf scramble program enhanced the youth?s life skills in many areas. Focusing on the development of accepting responsibility was the life skill that was most influenced. In addition to the life skills gained, the calf scramble {{had an impact on the}} educational goals of youth. 84 % of respondents said that participating in the Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo Calf Scramble Program contributed to their educational goals. Contributions included increased motivation, focused goals; livestock knowledge gained, allowed them to start a college fund, and influenced their career choice. The associated economic cost concluded for maintaince of a project was an average of $ 5, 443. Therefore the cost for the youth is known to be spread out across multiple areas. As a result of this study, the researcher recommends that youth should be encouraged to take part in the calf scramble program at the Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo. In addition, it should be promoted to youth to involve themselves in other leadership-developmental activities through other programs to further enhance their life skill development...|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate whether pubertal status and number of estrous cycles prior to breeding influences pregnancy rate in beef heifers. Pubertal heifers were heavier and older {{at the start of}} breeding and had greater AI and overall pregnancy rate than non-pubertal heifers. Second season pregnancy rate was greater for heifers reaching puberty prior to first <b>breeding</b> and for <b>heifers</b> having ≥ 2 estrouscycles prior to breeding compared with non-pubertal heifers. Pregnancy rate was greater for heifers achieving puberty prior to breeding; however, earlier onset of puberty did not significantly improve first pregnancy rates...|$|R
5000|$|The first cows were named, [...] "Faith," [...] "Hope," [...] and [...] "Charity," [...] and {{recipient}} {{families had}} to promise {{that they would}} donate the first female calf to another poor family.
