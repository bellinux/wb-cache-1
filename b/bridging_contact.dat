40|$|As {{iron ore}} {{deposits}} are depleted {{at the face}} of the mine site, deeper excavation is required to meet the requirements of the supplier. During this deeper excavation, increasing clay and moisture content leads to wet and sticky material (WSM). WSM's are prone to cause problems in all phases of the materials handling stream, which is attributed to the inter-particle and boundary cohesion and adhesion forces. These characteristics can be computationally expensive to model and with the development of discrete element modelling (DEM) and advancement in computational power over the past decade, it is now more feasible to model WSM's into the DEM technique. This paper will compare two different contact models that can represent the characteristics of a WSM. The first being a simplified Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) contact model which is an expanded form of the classic Hertz contact model. This model includes the tensile forces which are in the contact zone between two bodies when they are separated, which the Hertz model failed to capture [6]. The second model is that of a liquid <b>bridging</b> <b>contact,</b> which accounts for the capillary effects and surface tension that will form between two bodies such as that of a WSM. These two models were then simulated using LIGGHTS [8] as the software platform for a DEM technique simulation. Finally, qualitative experimental verification was undertaken to assess the applicability of the proposed models, where recommendations were made as to the accuracy of each of the contact models used...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of 100 -nm design rule technologies is currently {{taking place in}} many R&D facilities across the world. For some critical layers (gate, contact, local interconnect), the transition to 193 -nm resist technology has been required to meet this leading edge design rule. As with previous technology node transitions, the materials and processes available are undergoing changes and improvements as vendors encounter and solve problems. The initial implementation of the 193 -nm resist process {{did not meet the}} photolithography requirements of some IC manufacturers due to very high Post Exposure Bake (PEB) temperature sensitivity and consequently high wafer to wafer CD variation. The photoresist vendors have been working to improve the performance of the 193 -nm resists to meet their customer’s requirements. Characterization of these new resists needs to be carried out prior to implementation in the R&D line. Initial results on the second-generation resists evaluated at Cypress Semiconductor (San Jose, CA) showed better CD control compared to the earlier resist with comparable Depth of Focus (DOF), Exposure Latitude, Etch Resistance, etc. In addition to the standard lithography parameters, resist characterization needs to include defect density studies. It was found that the new resist process with the best CD control, resulted in the introduction of orders of magnitude higher yield limiting defects at Gate (micro <b>bridging),</b> <b>Contact</b> (deformed/closed contacts) and Local Interconnect.

Tool for describing the physics of the processes in the arc is the heat equation, in which {{the influence of the}} heat sources in the arc and the effect of the contraction of the axial section of the arc in the cathode region to a contact spot are taken into account. The diameter of the contact spot is several orders smaller than the diameter of the developed section of the arc column and this fact gives the chance to consider the contact spot as a mathematical point. The solution domain changes over time according to the law which is defined by the conditions of the <b>bridging</b> <b>contact.</b> At the fixed terminal time the contacts close and the solution domain of the problem degenerate. From a mathematical point of view, problematic nature of the problem consists {{in the presence of a}} moving boundary and degeneracy of the solution domain at the fixed terminal time. It should be emphasized that the boundary value problems for parabolic equations in a domain with a moving boundary are fundamentally different from the classical problems. Due to the size of the domain depending on the time for this type of problems methods of separating the variables and integral transformations not be applied, as remaining within the classical methods of mathematical physics you cannot conform the solution of the heat equation to the motion of the border line of the heat transport domain.|$|E

They did not win the contract immediately but continued to collaborate on it and other projects. The early 1920s were considered a tough time for bridge construction, so Steinman tried to design his bridges to be economically pleasing rather than artistic, without sacrificing the structural integrity of the bridge. For example, Robinson and Steinman changed the original plans for the Florianopolis bridge, using eyebar chains as the upper chord of the stiffening truss instead of the conventional wire-cable. The new design produced a very stiff bridge with much less material than the original plan.

40|$|The elucidation of ribosomal {{structure}} {{has shown that}} the function of ribosomes is fundamentally confined to dynamic interactions established between the RNA components of the ribosomal ensemble. These findings now enable a detailed analysis of the evolution of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) structure. The origin and diversification of rRNA was studied here using phylogenetic tools directly at the structural level. A rooted universal tree was reconstructed from the combined secondary structures of large (LSU) and small (SSU) subunit rRNA using cladistic methods and considerations in statistical mechanics. The evolution of the complete repertoire of structural ribosomal characters was formally traced lineage-by-lineage in the tree, showing a tendency towards molecular simplification and a homogeneous reduction of ribosomal structural change with time. Character tracing revealed patterns of evolution in inter-subunit <b>bridge</b> <b>contacts</b> and tRNA-binding sites that were consistent with the proposed coupling of tRNA translocation and subunit movement. These patterns support the concerted evolution of tRNA-binding sites in the two subunits and the ancestral nature and common origin of certain structural ribosomal features, such as the peptidyl (P) site, the functional relay of the penultimate stem helix of SSU rRNA, and other structures participating in ribosomal dynamics. Overall results provide a rare insight into the evolution of ribosomal structure...|$|R

Here, we describe the design, fabrication and testing of a silicon based micromachined switch using piezo-electrically actuated elements. The microwave circuit consists of a coplanar waveguide (CPW) design with two piezoelectric activated beams integrated between the middle line and the ground planes. During operation the beams short the CPW by two overhanging <b>bridge</b> <b>contacts</b> and therefore the transmission characteristics of the microwave circuit change. The CPW is realized by 3 A mu m thick electroplated copper to yield good transmission characteristics, whereas the clamped-clamped beams benefit from a 250 nm thin PZT film between 100 nm thin Pt electrodes {{on top of a}} SiO 2 layer. By the use of double side clamped beams awkward stress compensation of the piezoelectric stack is omitted. Instead the system relies on some initial mechanical stress. Measurements prove deflections of more than 13 A mu m for a 1400 A mu m long beam with operation voltages below 10 V. This is in good agreement with finite element simulations.

40|$|Stress-controlled {{swelling}} {{tests are}} normally {{conducted in the}} laboratory to characterize the evolution of coal permeability {{under the influence of}} gas sorption. Typically reductions in permeability are observed from gas-sorption-induced swelling even where effective stresses remain constant. This behavior remains enigmatic as the permeability of the porous coal is determined by the effective stress only. When these observations were interpreted, a matchstick or cubic coal model was assumed. Under this assumption, matrix swelling would not affect coal permeability because of the complete separation between matrix blocks caused by through-going fractures. This is why current coal permeability models have little success in explaining this inconsistency. It is generally believed that the reason for the failure is the inconsistency between the experimental conditions and the model assumptions. However, in this paper, it is considered that the reason may be the internal actions between coal fractures and matrixes have not been taken into consideration. In this study, a model capable of replicating this apparently anomalous behavior is developed. We consider the interactions of the fractured coal mass where cleats do not create a full separation between adjacent matrix blocks but where solid rock bridges are present. We accommodate the role of swelling strains both over <b>contact</b> <b>bridges</b> that hold cleat faces apart but also over the non-contacting span between these bridges. The effects of swelling act competitively over these two components: increasing porosity and permeability due to swelling of the <b>bridging</b> <b>contacts</b> but reducing porosity and permeability due to the swelling of the intervening free-faces. Under these conditions, a new permeability model is formulated. The new model is the key cross link that couples the multiphysics of coal-gas interactions.

A particular challenge stems from the realization that the properties of molecular wires are strongly influenced by the combined characteristics of the molecule and the metal contacts. While gold has been the most studied contact material to date, interest in molecular wires with transition metal contacts that ar e electronically more complex than gold is growing. This thesis presents a theoretical investigation of electron transport and associated phenomena in molecular wires with transition metal contacts. An appropriate methodology is developed on the basis of Landauer theory and ab initio and semi-empirical considerations and new, physically important systems are identified. Spin-dependent transport mechanisms and device characteristics are explored for molecular wires with ferromagnetic iron contacts, systems that have not been considered previously, either theoretically or experimentally.

A pool of mercury fills the lower portion of the tube, but is insufficient to <b>bridge</b> the <b>contacts.</b> A magnetic slug of iron or steel is placed in the tube, where it sinks by gravity so as to displace the mercury. The displaced mercury rises in the tube, sufficiently to <b>bridge</b> the <b>contacts</b> and complete the circuit between them. Around the top part of the tube is placed the coil. When energised, this coil attracts the slug, lifting it upwards and out of the mercury pool. The mercury is no longer displaced, so flows downwards, away from the upper contact and the circuit opens. This allows for normally closed operation. For the more traditional normally open relay operation, the side contact is arranged somewhat higher up (or the volume of mercury is reduced) so that contact is not made when the iron slug is freely floating on the pool of mercury. The control coil is mounted below the rest level of the slug and when energised draws down the slug deeper into the pool displacing additional mercury thus raising the level to the previously uncovered side contact and closing the circuit.|$|R

In addition, LQC could <b>bridge</b> <b>contact</b> with astronomical observations, and thus potentially investigate quantum cosmology modelings {{in the light of}} observations. To do so however, modeling both the background evolution and its perturbations is needed. The latter described cosmic inhomogeneities that are the main cosmological observables.

We particularly highlight that in this framework, the algebra of hypersurface deformation receives quantum corrections, and we discuss their meaning. The primordial power spectra of scalar and tensor inhomogeneities are then presented, assuming initial conditions are set in the contracting phase preceding the quantum bounce and the well-known expanding phase of the cosmic history. These spectra are subsequently propagated to angular power spectra of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background. It is then shown that regardless of the choice for the initial conditions inside the effective approach for the background evolution (except that they are set in the contracting phase), the predicted angular power spectra of the polarized B-modes exceed the upper bound currently set by observations. The exclusion of this specific version of LQC establishes the falsifiability of the approach, though one shall not conclude here that either LQC or LQG excluded...|$|R
50|$|Many {{alternative}} solutions, {{particularly those}} based upon an AC Switch Disconnect design which use <b>bridge</b> <b>contacts,</b> have been modified and rated for DC operation. These types of product have a switching speed that is {{directly linked to}} the operator speed, therefore slow operation of the handle results in slow contact separation of the contacts which can produce arcing times of 100ms or more. Additionally in these switches, the contact surface is also the surface upon which electrical arcs tend to form; therefore any surface damage or sooting caused by arcing {{is likely to have}} a detrimental effect on the isolators contact resistance and its longevity.TRUE DC Solar Isolators use a rotary knife contact mechanism so when the unit is operated, the handle movement gives a double make/break per contact set. As DC load switching creates electrical arcing, the design is such that this only occurs on the corners of the switching parts meaning that the main contact is made on an area where no arcing has occurred. The rotary contact mechanism methodology used in TRUE DC solar isolators means that when the isolator is operated, a self-cleaning action occurs on the arcing points and contact surfaces thereby producing good high-vibration resistant contact integrity, with reduced contact resistance. This contact system ensures that power loss per pole is kept as low as possible, and consistent {{over the life of the}} product, unlike conventional style isolators where entrapment of contaminants, and then subsequent compression on lateral operation, can lead to variable and increasing contact resistance, and hence per pole losses.|$|R

With the help of density functional theory, we calculate the relaxed geometries and vibrational modes of extended molecules each consisting of one or two PDT molecules connecting two gold nanoclusters. We formulate a perturbative theory of inelastic tunneling through molecules <b>bridging</b> metal <b>contacts</b> in terms of elastic transmission amplitudes, and use this theory to calculate the inelastic tunneling spectra of the gold-PDT-gold extended molecules. We consider PDT molecules with both trans and gauche conformations bound to the gold clusters at top, bridge and hollow bonding sites. Comparing our results with the experimental data of Hihath et al.

We find the switching from the 42 meV vibrational mode to the 46 meV mode observed in the experiment to be due to the transition of trans molecules from mixed top-bridge to pure top-site bonding geometries. Our results also indicate that gauche molecular conformations and hollow site bonding did not contribute significantly to the experimental inelastic tunneling spectra.
