500|$|... "One Minute" [...] is an {{alternative}} rock song with electropop influences, and begins with Clarkson singing, [...] "You're going crazy, running on empty / You can't {{make up your mind}} / You try to hide it, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say it / Restless all this time." [...] It is composed in the key of A major and is set in time signature of common time, with a tempo of 124 beats per minute. Clarkson's vocal range spans over an octave, from A3 to D5. Critics have observed the influence of 1980s music on the song, while Talia Kraines of BBC Music compared it to pop rock songs released by singers Ashlee Simpson and Lindsay Lohan. A reviewer for Billboard commented on the song's structure, writing that [...] "One Minute" [...] consists of [...] "rapid-fire give-and-take verses".|$|E

2500|$|In 1950, Goldsmith {{found work}} at CBS {{as a clerk}} typist in the network's music {{department}} under director Lud Gluskin. There he began writing scores for such radio shows as CBS Radio Workshop, Frontier Gentleman, and Romance. [...] In an interview with Andy Velez from BarnesandNoble.com, Goldsmith stated, [...] "It was about 1950. CBS had a workshop, and once a week the employees, whatever their talents, whether they were ushers or typists, would produce a radio show. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be an employee. They needed someone to do music, and I knew someone there who said I'd be great for this. I'd just gotten married and needed a job, so they faked a typing test for me. Then I could do these shows. About six months later, the music department heard what I did, liked it, {{and gave me a}} job." [...] He later progressed into scoring such live CBS television shows as Climax! and Playhouse 90. [...] He also scored multiple episodes of the television series The Twilight Zone. He remained at CBS until 1960, after which he moved on to Revue Studios and then to MGM Studios for producer Norman Felton, whom he had worked for during live television and would later compose music for such television shows as Dr. Kildare and The Man from U.N.C.L.E..|$|E

60|$|In {{consequence}} of pending treaty negotiations {{the government had}} become particular about the privileges it granted.

There was Sally, for example, a stump-tail bitch, as good a dog with sheep as he ever possessed, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> consider her feelings.
