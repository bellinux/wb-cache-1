50|$|Mining {{properties}} of the area lie in an oval basin surrounded by crystalline rocks. This basin has been cut through by the Nechi river, which separates the properties. Within this basin are flat tables of gravel deposits whose edges form terraces. The bedrock {{of each of these}} gravel benches is clay, either red or blue according to exposure, in which are included beds of peat or brown coal. Each of these gravel benches is a re-concentration of the bench above it, and represents a former stationary level of the river. California Hill is a remnant of the upper bench. Below this was a lower bench whose bedrock stood above water-level. These two benches have been nearly removed by erosion and ancient workings. The third bench, partly submerged, forms the greater portion of the higher dredging ground. The fourth bench is that being dredged now and is nearly submerged. The outer and higher <b>bench</b> <b>gravel</b> is on the clay which lies directly upon the rim rock, but toward the centre of the basin, where there are lower layers of gravel, is assumed to be bedrock. The gold here is of fairly uniform sized thin flakes. There is very little black sand.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{describes the}} geology of the Last Coachella Tunnel of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. This tunnel extends {{along the southern}} flank of the Little San Bernardino Mountains, in Riverside county, California. Four rock types were encountered in the excavation of the tunnel: a regionally metamorphosed series of schists and gneisses of sedimentary origin, here called the Berdoo series; granitoid rocks resulting from replacement, called the Thermal Canyon series; a grananitic intrusive called the Fargo granite; and <b>bench</b> <b>gravels.</b> The Berdoo series is divisible {{on the basis of}} lithology into three facies: a dark thin-bedded feldspathic and biotitic schist, a light gray feldspathic gneiss, and a medium gray coarse grained schist which is transitional between the first two. The Thermal Canyon series consist of massive granitoid rocks which are of the mineralogical composition and general aspect of quartz-diorites. 	 Between these two rock series occurs a transition zone of from 1000 to 6000 feet in width within which, as examined in the field, the sedimentary textures and structures which characterize the Berdoo series appear to gradually give way to the massive granitoid textures of the Thermal Canyon series. Petrographic studies reveal the existence of a zone of mineralogical gradation between the two series within which the assemblage which constitutes the Berdoo series gradually becomes replaced through recrystallization by that which constitutes the Thermal Canyon series. The minerals of the recrystallized assemblage are not conformable to definite surfaces such as bedding, but instead show the fortuitous orientation of an igneous rock. Also, the plagioclase feldspars of the recrystallized assemblage are slightly more calcic than those of the Berdoo series. Chemical analyses show that the composition of the two rock series is very nearly the same, excepting for a progressive increase in lime, and corresponding decreases in ferric iron and potassa with advancing recrystallization. The results of field, petrographic, and chemical methods of investigation thus indicate that the Thermal Canyon series rocks resulted trough recrystallization of a portion of the Berdoo series rocks. Ascending hot solutions and gases of magmatic origin are postulated as the actuating agencies in the recrystallization. The Fargo granite occurs as an intrusive stock in the east central portion of the area, and consists of a pinkish gray coarsely crystalline rock of about the mineralogical composition of a quartz-monzonite. The chief structural feature of the area is faulting, of which two systems are recognizable, one which trends easterly, and one which trends northerly. Two successive periods of domical uplift in the south-eastern portion of the area are postulated as causes for the faulting. The geological aspects of tunnel excavation, with especial reference to the influence of structure, are discussed briefly. ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years, {{understanding}} of how river channel morphology adjusts to upstream impoundment has been improved considerably with clearwater erosion close to the dam and aggradation downstream of unregulated tributary confluences being identified. In a UK context our understanding of channel response to impoundment has been based principally on analysis {{of a number of}} regulated rivers using a time–space substitution approach but the temporal pattern of channel change was not fully observed. This paper details channel change over almost six decades following impoundment of the River Spey, Scotland, primarily via the use of cartographic and aerial photographic evidence. Channel change initially involved the formation of tributary confluence bars followed by bench development and vegetation colonization and development on the <b>benches</b> and <b>gravel</b> bars. Sixty years after impoundment, the channel is still adjusting its form at distance from the dam to be in quasiequilibrium with its regulated flow regime; indeed adjustment was most rapid between 1989 to 1995. This accelerated adjustment is due to the occurrence of a greater number of large and geomorphologically significant flood events in this period. Sediment supply limitation from unregulated tributaries will have stemmed the rate of narrowing and bench development prior to 1989. This spatial and temporal pattern of adjustment supports, for the most part, the model advocated by Petts (Progress in Physical Geography, 1979, Vol. 3, pp. 329 – 362).

As she drew closer she saw these ants were men, digging for gold. Those near at hand could be plainly seen--rough, ragged, bearded men and smooth-faced boys. Farther on and up the slope, along the waterways and ravines, were miners so close they seemed almost to interfere with one another. The creek bottom was alive with busy, silent, violent men, bending over the water, washing and shaking and paddling, all desperately intent upon something. They had not time to look up. They were ragged, unkempt, barearmed and bare-legged, {{every last one of}} them with back bent. For a mile or more Kells's party trotted through this part of the diggings, and everywhere, on rocky <b>bench</b> and <b>gravel</b> bar and gray slope, were holes with men picking and shoveling in them. Some were deep and some were shallow; some long trenches and others mere pits. If all of these prospectors were finding gold, then gold was everywhere. And presently Joan did not need to have Kells tell her that all of these diggers were finding dust. How silent they were--how tense! They were not mechanical. It was a soul that drove them. Joan had seen many men dig for gold, and find a little now and then, but she had never seen men dig when they knew they were going to strike gold. That made the strange difference.|$|R

40|$|Studying {{the lower}} Shoshone River Basin’s (SRB) striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) rabies 6 -year {{epizootic}} in northwestern Wyoming has produced four didactic lessons. First, physiographic changes by settlers circa 1900 affected its zoogeography {{by creating a}} canal system for irrigating crops originating at Buffalo Bill Reservoir (BBR). The resulting landscape changes increased agricultural lands and skunk habitat eightfold between the valley’s steep <b>gravel</b> <b>benches.</b> The valley was historically free of skunk rabies until the epizootic’s index case in August 1988. Second, human intervention began when the Bighorn County Predator Board (BCPB) proactively implemented rabies trapping surveillance and depopulation programs in 1989. The epizootic’s second case occurred in February 1989. From 1990 – 1993, the U. S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services (WS) Wyoming office continued these programs. The epizootic ended in 1993 with over 200 rabid animals diagnosed by the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory (WSVL) from about 1, 000 skunks tested. Cooperator agreements began in January 1989 and continued throughout the epizootic for trapping and shooting of potential vectors. Third, WS National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) analyzed the epizootic movements using monthly mean movements and standardized ellipsoids. These analyses demonstrated that rabies dispersed radially from the index case until it reached the Shoshone River. From there, the epizootic spread downstream until stopped by Bighorn Lake (BL) in 1989 and upstream until stopped by BBR in 1992. Fourth, descriptive multivariate movement maps (MMMs) of the epizootic were analogous to fluid wave characteristics describing a swell moving along {{the surface of a}} liquid as the “leading edge” and “crest. ” All rabid animal locations were derived from the first use of global positioning system (GPS) in investigating wildlife disease.
