40|$|Insoluble {{constituents}} in 3104 alloy for beverage cans manufacturing play {{an important}} role in deep ironing process. This paper studies the effect of Fe content in the alloy on volume fraction of the constituents Al 6 (Fe, Mn) 3 and Al 12 (Fe, Mn) 3 Si and its influence on ironing die pickup. It is shown that with Fe content increase, the amount of these constituents rises that helps prevent tool galling. Trials made at a can plant showed less ironing die changeovers at <b>bodymakers.</b> The opti-mum Fe content for aluminum can production can be considered between 0. 47 % and 0. 53 % that corresponds to 2. 0 %- 2. 3 % of insoluble constituent volume fraction. Greater amounts than this cause problems with excessive constituent particle formation and earing; smaller amounts result in increased ironing die galling...|$|R
