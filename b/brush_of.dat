Other similar body structures include the large ocelli, short scapes, 12 antennomeres (antenna segments), small eyes, and a clypeal margin that has a row of peg-like denticles (small bumps on a tooth). Queens can be distinguished from Gerontoformica by their flattened, broad heads. They have a broad, concave clypeal margin with a high number of denticles and two short vertical rows of denticles. They have mandibles which are half the length of Gerontoformica and have a dense <b>brush</b> <b>of</b> spicule-like setae. Furthermore, the vertex (the upper surface of the head) has a pair of oval-shaped rugose (wrinkled) patches.|$|E

We use mean field and self-consistent field theoretical models to consider repulsive interactions between <b>brushes</b> <b>of</b> branched (dendritic) macromolecules tethered to planar and spherical surfaces. It is demonstrated that compared to planar <b>brushes</b> <b>of</b> linear chains, the <b>brushes</b> composed <b>of</b> dendritic macromolecules provide a sharper repulsive force when pushed to overlap. The sharp increase in force is found also for dendron brush-decorated spherical particles. At the same distance between surfaces, apposing dendron brushes interpenetrate less than <b>brushes</b> <b>of</b> linear chains with the same mass per unit area. Hence the colloidal stability of dendron brush-decorated particles will {{go hand in hand}} with improved tribological properties of dispersions...|$|R

500|$|Paine's Age of Reason sparked enough {{anger in}} Britain to {{initiate}} {{not only a}} series of government prosecutions but also a pamphlet war. Around 50 unfavorable replies appeared between 1795 and 1799 alone and refutations were still being published in 1812. Many of these responded specifically to Paine's attack on the Bible in Part II (when Thomas Williams was prosecuted for printing Part II, it became clear its circulation had far exceeded that of Part I). Although critics responded to Paine's analysis of the Bible, they did not usually address his specific arguments. Instead, they advocated a literal reading of the Bible, citing the Bible's long history as evidence of its authority. They also issued ad hominem attacks against Paine, describing him [...] "as an enemy of proper thought and of the morality of decent, enlightened people". Dissenters such as Joseph Priestley who had endorsed the arguments of the Rights of Man turned away from those presented in The Age of Reason. Even the liberal Analytical Review was skeptical of Paine's claims and distanced itself from the book. Paine's deism was simply too radical for these more moderate reformers and they feared being tarred with the <b>brush</b> <b>of</b> extremism.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike {{professional}} literary critics, {{most prominent}} Russian {{writers of the}} time supported the novel wholeheartedly. Goncharov, Turgenev, Leskov, Dostoyevsky and Fet have all gone on record as declaring War and Peace the masterpiece of the Russian literature. Ivan Goncharov in a July 17, 1878 letter to Pyotr Ganzen advised him to choose for translating into Danish War and Peace, adding: [...] "This is positively {{what might be called}} a Russian Iliad. Embracing the whole epoch, it is the grandiose literary event, showcasing the gallery of great men painted by a lively <b>brush</b> <b>of</b> the great master ... This is one of the most, if not the most profound literary work ever. In 1879, unhappy with Ganzen having chosen Anna Karenina to start with, Goncharov insisted: [...] "War and Peace is the extraordinary poem of a novel, both in content and execution. It also serves as a monument to Russian history's glorious epoch when whatever figure you take is a colossus, a statue in bronze. Even [...] minor characters carry all the characteristic features of the Russian people and its life." [...] In 1885, expressing satisfaction with the fact that Tolstoy's works have now been translated into Danish, Goncharov again stressed the immense importance of War and Peace. [...] "Count Tolstoy really mounts over everybody else here [...] ", he remarked.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the greater}} part of China's first great period of unification, begun with the {{short-lived}} Qin Dynasty (221 BC – 206 BC) and followed by the centuries-long Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), the shi form of poetry underwent little innovation. But a distinctively descriptive and erudite fu form (not the same fu character as that used for the bureau of music) developed that has been called [...] "rhyme-prose," [...] a uniquely Han offshoot of Chinese poetry's tradition. Equally noteworthy is Music Bureau poetry (yuefu), collected and presumably refined popular lyrics from folk music. [...] The end of the Han witnesses a resurgence of the shi poetry, with the anonymous 19 Old Poems. [...] This collection reflects the emergence of a distinctive five-character line that later became shi poetry's most common line length. From the Jian'an reign period (196 - 220 AD) onward, the five-character line became a focus for innovations in style and theme. The Cao family, rulers of the Wei Dynasty (220 - 265 AD) during the post-Han Three Kingdoms period, distinguished themselves as poets by writing poems filled with sympathy for the day-to-day struggles of soldiery and the common people. Taoist philosophy became a different, common theme for other poets, and a genre emphasizing true feeling emerged led by Ruan Ji (210-263). The landscape genre of Chinese nature poetry emerged under the <b>brush</b> <b>of</b> Xie Lingyun (385-433), as he innovated distinctively descriptive and complementary couplets composed of five-character lines. A farmland genre was born in obscurity by Tao Qian (365-427) also known as Tao Yuanming as he labored in his fields and then wrote extolling the influence of wine. Toward the close of this period in which many later-developed themes were first experimented with, the Xiao family of the Southern Liang Dynasty (502-557) engaged in highly refined and often denigrated court-style poetry lushly describing sensual delights as well as the description of objects.|$|E

The flow field characteristic <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seal was discussed based on three-dimensional (3 -D) computational model <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seal, two-way fluid–structure interaction and moving grid technique. Then the effect of structural parameters on the leakage characteristic <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seals was investigated from theoretical and numerical simulation perspectives with the emphasis on an improved prediction formula of leakage flow rate <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seals. As illustrated in the analysis of the leakage characteristics <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seals, (1) the leakage with the influence of bristle deflection is closer to the results of experiment relative to that without bristle deflection, and increases with the increasing inlet/outlet pressure ratios, which validate the developed 3 -D computational model with bristle deflection to be more reasonable; (2) the flow field characteristics (pressure and velocity) <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seal are revealed reasonably; (3) with the increasing of the height of backing plate fence, the clearance <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> wire and the axial clearance between brush bristle and back plate, the leakage factor rises and then reaches a stable value when the clearance <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> is larger than 0. 3 mm; moreover, (4) with the increase <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> wire diameter, the leakage factor decreases firstly and then tends to stabilization, while rapidly decreases at first, then slowly decreases, and lastly tends to a value when the bristle row number increases; (5) the reliability and accuracy of the proposed prediction equation for brush seals is validated to be high by the CFD computational results. The efforts of this paper provide a useful theoretical and numerical method to clearly understand the leakage characteristics <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seal, which is beneficial to improve the design <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seals.
