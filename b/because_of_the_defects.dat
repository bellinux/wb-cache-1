Murine ASHP was discovered as a GATA- 1 target gene and human AHSP is directly regulated by GATA- 1. More recently, AHSP was rediscovered as a highly erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF) -dependent transcript. We have determined <b>the</b> organisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murine AHSP gene and compared it to orthologs. There are two CACC box elements in the proximal promoter. The proximal element is absolutely conserved, but does not bind EKLF as it is not a canonical binding site. In rodents, the distal element contains a 3 bp insertion that disrupts the typical EKLF binding consensus region. Nevertheless, EKLF binds this atypical site by gel mobility shift assay, specifically occupies the AHSP promoter in vivo in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and transactivates AHSP through this CACC site in promoter-reporter assays. Our results suggest EKLF can occupy CACC elements in vivo that are not predictable from the consensus binding site inferred from structural studies.

Multi-scale based fusion methods can often obtain fused images with good visual effect. However, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>defects</b> of the fusion rules, {{it is almost impossible}} to completely avoid the loss of useful information in the thus obtained fused images. The proposed fusion scheme can be divided into two processes: initial fusion and final fusion. The initial fusion is based on a dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). The Sum-Modified-Laplacian (SML) -based visual contrast and SML are employed to fuse the low- and high-frequency coefficients, respectively, and an initial composited image is obtained. In the final fusion process, the image block residuals technique and consistency verification are used to detect the focusing areas and then a decision map is obtained. The map is used to guide how to achieve the final fused image. The performance of the proposed method was extensively tested on a number of multi-focus images, including no-referenced images, referenced images, and images with different noise levels.

The first chapter of this work concentrate on what technology actually is, its relation with science and the problems it creates for society. Two questions are asked: 1.

A broad definition of technology brings out the relation {{of science and technology}}. The key concept is: control over nature, non-human as well as human. The theories of Marx and Engels show that technology and science {{are an integral part of}} society and cannot be seen as separated from it. This obvious point is taken by the Frankfurt school which discusses the ideological aspects of technology and science. This culminates in the notion of technology as ideology itself (Habermas).

40|$|Abstract 0. 98 Na 0. 5 K 0. 5 NbO 3 – 0. 02 Bi 0. 5 Na 0. 5 TiO 3 (NKNBNT) nano-powder was {{fabricated}} by {{mechanical alloying}} method. The NKNBNT particle and water molecular on the particle surface became an insulator/ conductor system <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface <b>defect</b> and moisture absorption of Na and K ions. A large non-Debye relaxation {{was found in}} <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> 250 to 450 K in this system. Its dielectric constant is higher 3 - 4 order of magnitude than that of pure NKN ceramics. This relaxation includes three regions, and <b>the</b> maximum <b>of</b> dielectric constant is near percolation value. This porous composite {{is expected to be}} used as a super capacitor or moisture device...|$|R
