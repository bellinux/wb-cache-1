5|$|Describing {{the system}} in November 1988, Cray stated that the 12 times {{performance}} increase would <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of a three times increase due to GaAs circuits, and four times due {{to the use of}} more processors. One of the problems with the Cray-2 had been poor multiprocessing performance due to limited bandwidth between the processors, and to address this the Cray-3 would adopt the much faster architecture used in the Cray Y-MP. This would provide a design performance of 8000 MIPS, or 16 GFLOPS.|$|E

5|$|Having {{succeeded in}} {{reversing}} the Harrison administration's silver policy, Cleveland sought next {{to reverse the}} effects of the McKinley tariff. The Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act was introduced by West Virginian Representative William L. Wilson in December 1893. After lengthy debate, the bill passed the House by a considerable margin. The bill proposed moderate downward revisions in the tariff, especially on raw materials. The shortfall in revenue was to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> by an income tax of two percent on income above $4,000 (US$ today).|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, the Australian government decided to raise an all volunteer force for overseas service due to the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) which precluded sending the Militia outside of Australian territory to fight. While this force would draw from the military forces that already existed—the part-time Citizens Force and the Permanent Military Force—it would be largely <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> from recruits not currently serving. Known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), initially it was to consist of 20,000 men, comprising one infantry division and a light horse brigade. Recruitment for the first intake began on 10 August 1914, and the 7th Battalion was among the first units raised, forming less than a fortnight after the declaration of war.|$|E

The two transfer windows run from {{the last day of}} the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis. As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances. This was to enable the 'home grown' rule to be enacted, whereby the League would also from 2010 require at least 8 of the named 25 man squad to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of 'home-grown players'.|$|E
5|$|The Law Society asked Coopers & Lybrand {{to produce}} {{a report on the}} Law Society, which {{included}} its disciplinary topics among the areas to be reported on.

In 1985 the National Consumer Council published a survey showing that only 15% of respondents felt that the Law Society should be investigating complaints, and only 5% felt that if an independent body was created it should contain a solicitor majority, with 36% wanting equal representation of solicitors and lay people and 55% preferring a majority of lay people.|$|E
5|$|What {{all these}} {{different}} varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from {{the details of the}} physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From this point of view, it does not really matter whether the kidney <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.|$|E

5|$|Following the Federation of Australia in 1901, the {{amalgamation}} of {{the military}} forces controlled by the six separate, self-governing British colonies to form a unified force controlled by the Commonwealth was an inevitable, albeit slowly realised, consequence, given that the new Constitution of Australia assigned the defence power solely to the Commonwealth. Indeed, this process took some time as, to a large extent, matters of defence were not necessarily a priority of the new Australian legislature at the time, {{and there was also}} a considerable diversity in opinion regarding the composition and size of the new national army and role it would play at home and indeed within the wider Imperial defence system. Nevertheless, the official transfer of forces from the states to the Commonwealth occurred on 1 March 1901, and this date is today celebrated as the birthday of the modern Australian Army. At the outset, the bulk of the Commonwealth military force was to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of part-time volunteers. This was arguably due to two factors. Firstly, there was a widespread desire amongst Australian policymakers to keep defence expenditure low, while secondly there was a widespread mistrust or suspicion surrounding the idea of a large standing army.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, {{as part of}} Operation Okra the Australian Army {{deployed}} a Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) {{of approximately}} 200 personnel to the United Arab Emirates in preparation for operations to assist and advise Iraqi Security Forces following an offensive by Islamic State forces. The soldiers {{were expected to be}} deployed to Iraq when a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the Australian and Iraqi Governments. The majority of the SOTG was reported to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of C Company, 2nd Commando Regiment. It began moving into Iraq in early November. The 2nd Commando Regiment was tasked with training the Iraq government's Counter Terrorism Service. Personnel from SOTG have also been involved in co-ordinating airstrikes remotely to assist Iraqi forces engaged in clearance operations. From September 2015, the strength of SOTG rotations were reduced to approximately 80 personnel.|$|E

All members of the HDMI Forum have equal voting rights, may participate in the Technical Working Group, and if elected can be on the Board of Directors. There is no limit to the number of companies allowed in the HDMI Forum though companies must pay an annual fee of US$15,000 with an additional annual fee of $5,000 for those companies who serve on the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of 11 companies who are elected every 2 years by a general vote of HDMI Forum members. All future development of the HDMI specification will take place in the HDMI Forum and will be built upon the HDMI 1.4b specification.

5|$|Subsequent {{reviews of}} defence {{policy and the}} {{strategic}} situation in South East Asia after the war had resulted {{in the formation of}} the Australian Regiment in 1948, the first regular infantry unit of the Australian Army. From that time on as tension within the region increased the strength of the Regular Army increased rapidly in contrast to the CMF, signifying if not an end to Australian military planners' reliance upon citizen soldiers, at least a shift in focus and a realisation of the mistakes that had been made prior to World War II. This would see the CMF providing a platform upon which the Army could mobilise in the event of a war. Initially, the plan had been for the CMF to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of 50,000 men organised into two divisions and other units, however, recruitment was unable to meet these targets as initially it was attempted to achieve this through voluntary enlistment. Indeed, in its first year of existence, the actual strength of the CMF was only 8,698 personnel, although this rose the following year to 16,202 and to 32,779 in 1950. In March 1951, a system of compulsory national service was re-established.|$|E

5|$|The costliest war in U.S. {{history in}} terms of American life, this war {{has been the subject}} of, or the {{backdrop}} to, numerous films, documentaries and mini-series. One of the earliest films using the Civil War as its subject was D.W. Griffith's 1910 silent picture, The Fugitive. Films that have the war as its main subject, or about a certain aspect of the war include the 1989 film, Glory, about the first formal unit of the Union Army during the American Civil War to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> entirely of black men. Some films such as Gettysburg focused on a single battle during the war, or even on a single incident, like the French short film, La Rivière du Hibou (An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge). Others like the 1993 miniseries North and South spanned the entire breadth of the war. Some films deal with the human aspects of the war, such as The Red Badge of Courage (1951), or Shenandoah (1965), on the tragedy that the war inflicted on the civilian population. Ken Burns's The Civil War is the most watched documentary in the history of PBS.|$|E
