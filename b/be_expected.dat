5|$|Tectonics-based {{events will}} {{continue}} to occur well into {{the future and the}} surface will be steadily reshaped by tectonic uplift, extrusions, and erosion. Mount Vesuvius can <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to erupt about 40 times over the next 1,000 years. During the same period, about five to seven earthquakes of magnitude 8 or greater should occur along the San Andreas Fault, while about 50 magnitude 9 events may <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> worldwide. Mauna Loa should experience about 200 eruptions over the next 1,000 years, and the Old Faithful Geyser will likely cease to operate. The Niagara Falls {{will continue to}} retreat upstream, reaching Buffalo in about 30,00050,000 years.|$|E

50|$|The {{programme}} <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> {{to begin}} with a welcome reception at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum on May 7, 2008. The main conference <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to <b>be</b> on the morning of May 8, 2008, followed by afternoon forums for delegates. A gala dinner <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to <b>be</b> held that evening at Hillsborough Castle.

5|$|According to Hepburn (2006, pp.238–239), “it should <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> that {{industry}} will lobby furiously against any auctioning.” Hepburn et al. (2006) state {{that it is}} an empirical fact that while businesses tend to oppose auctioning of emissions permits, economists almost uniformly recommend auctioning permits. Garnaut notes that the complexity of free allocation, and the large amounts of money involved, encourage non-productive rent-seeking behaviour and lobbying of governments, activities that dissipate economic value.|$|E
5|$|According to Walter Breen, Snowden {{most likely}} chose the {{combination}} of the Indian Head and the laurel wreath as it was the lowest relief of any of the options, and could <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to strike well. On November 4, 1858, Snowden wrote to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb about the Indian Head design, and two days later wrote to Longacre, informing him that it was approved. Longacre was to prepare the necessary dies for production, which was to begin on January 1, 1859.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of this}} reform, the six Army Reserve brigades {{are being}} paired with the regular brigades. The 4th and 9th Brigades will partner with the 1st Brigade, the 5th and 8th Brigades with the 7th Brigade, and the 11th and 13th Brigades with the 3rd Brigade. The pairs of Army Reserve brigades will <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> {{to be able to}} provide a battalion-sized force upon {{mobilisation}} during the regular brigade's 12 month 'ready' phase.|$|E
5|$|Benford's law {{describes}} {{the occurrence of}} digits in many data sets, such as heights of buildings. According to Benford's law, {{the probability that the}} first decimal-digit of an item in the data sample is d (from 1 to 9) equals , regardless of the unit of measurement. Thus, about 30% of the data can <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to have 1 as first digit, 18% start with 2, etc. Auditors examine deviations from Benford's law to detect fraudulent accounting.|$|E

5|$|Consultants who {{prepared}} the Environmental Impact Assessment report in 2001 for the Central reclamation noted the pier's {{significant role in}} Hong Kong's transport history.

5|$|During secret {{surrender}} {{negotiations with}} the Allies in early September, the Italian government offered to open the ports of Taranto and Brindisi on the eastern coast. German forces in that area were very weak and would <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to withdraw rather than fight if the Allies landed there. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean, quickly planned a third landing, codenamed Slapstick, {{to take advantage of}} the offer.|$|E
5|$|Electricity is used within telecommunications, {{and indeed}} the {{electrical}} telegraph, demonstrated commercially in 1837 by Cooke and Wheatstone, was one of its earliest applications. With the construction of first intercontinental, and then transatlantic, telegraph systems in the 1860s, electricity had enabled communications in minutes across the globe. Optical fibre and satellite communication have taken {{a share of the}} market for communications systems, but electricity can <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to remain {{an essential part of the}} process.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the example}} of Mozambique, the Zambian and Botswana governments {{permitted}} guerrillas to establish bases from which they could threaten and infiltrate Rhodesia.

5|$|Given that E°(O2/H2O) = +1.229V, {{which is}} less than +1.395V, it would <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> that {{chlorine}} {{should be able to}} oxidise water to oxygen and hydrochloric acid. However, the kinetics of this reaction are unfavorable, and there is also a bubble overpotential effect to consider, so that electrolysis of aqueous chloride solutions evolves chlorine gas and not oxygen gas, a fact that is very useful for the industrial production of chlorine.|$|E
30|$|Even {{though the}} {{infrastructure}} for Argentina {{is enough to}} meet the energy requirement, its commercial production has started and <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> to expand. Algeria’s gas production has decreased and <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> to bring its first commercial shale gas production by 2020. Mexico has projected to commence production from shale gas at commercial level till 2030; the contribution from shale <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> to <b>be</b> more than 75 % of total natural gas production by 2040. As a result, global supply shale gas <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> to <b>be</b> very high in ensuing years. It <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> that shale gas will be the third global energy source by 2035.|$|R
