2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed in}} Lueders Park in Compton, a recreational park {{located in a}} residential area bordering Rosecrans Avenue. [...] The entire fuselage, both engines, main rotor head assembly, four main rotor blades, and the pylon assembly were located in the main impact area. [...] The fifth main rotor blade (yellow) including the sleeve and part of spindle, was located approximately 0.25 miles (0.4km) north-west of the main wreckage site. [...] Minor parts associated with this rotor blade were scattered over a three-block area northwest of the park. [...] Examination of the yellow <b>blade</b> <b>spindle</b> (S/N AJ19) revealed a fatigue fracture in the shank of the spindle adjacent to the shoulder in the inboard end of the shank.|$|E
40|$|Cavitation {{characteristics}} for {{a family}} of skewed propellers were obtained by using an in-house panel method code PROPELLA. The propellers used were the existing NSRDC (US Navy Ship Research and Development Center) skewed propellers. Detailed geometry, open water test data, and results obtained from physical cavitation tunnel tests for these propellers were taken from published literature. Predictions were completed using appropriate wake data (either uniform inflow or measured wake survey data) to determine individual <b>blade</b> <b>spindle</b> torque, in-plane and out-of-plane bending moments and their fluctuations in both open water and behind-ship conditions. For the design speed, cavitation performance was assessed in both the open water and behind-ship conditions to determine thrust and torque breakdown. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this diploma work is to predict {{the action of the}} swirl turbine in a siphonal {{configuration}} using the potential energy provided by the river Úpa near the city Jaroměř. The hydraulic predictions of the turbine impellor were based on calculation made using the CFD program Fluent. The measurement of the draft tube and the strength calculations of the turbine <b>blade</b> and <b>spindle</b> are based upon the theories, experiments and finally on the knowledge gained from the test models constructed. The results of this project can be used when considering the viability of a small hydraulic power plant...|$|R
40|$|The multiaxis {{machining}} technology using a non-rotating cutting tool {{can produce a}} well-finished surface with little machining damage or roughness, {{and can be used}} to remove the remaining material in a concavity formed by the ball nosed end mill. This technique will extend the machining limits beyond the processing capability of the rotating tool. However, the single-blade non-rotating tool does not have a long life nor a flexibility for cutting various shapes. Therefore, a cylindrical non-rotating tool with long life and multiusability has been developed. This tool machines using a sharp blade having a wide curvature which gets shape by its inclination toward the feed direction. The cylindrical non-rotating tool can precisely machine a wide surface always with a sharp portion of the blade, because it can perform cutting at an arbitrary position on the <b>blade</b> due to <b>spindle</b> axis turn positioning. On the other hand, non-rotating machining with μm-scale cutting depth requires more precise CL data than is necessary with a rotating tool. If such CL data are generated by existing methods, a greatly increased quantity of data results, and more time is required to generate an offset surface. However, the copy simulation CAM method for multiaxis machining has been developed, which makes it possible to calculate highly precise CL data without offset processing. The imaginary stylus of this copy simulation CAM method traces on a surface of the defined shape while it self-determines the distance and course to the defined shape. Therefore, it is easy to determine the necessary tool axis vector for multiaxis machining, and the present method can generate highly precise CL data for non-rotating cutting. Results of machining experiments with this CAM method and the cylindrical non-rotating tool show that (1) it was able to get a good surface with approximate roughness of 2 μmRy by smoothing machining, (2) it was able to completely removed material remaining in the concavity formed by a ball-nosed end mill, (3) the non-rotating tool and copy simulation CAM method for multiaxis machining can significantly extend the machining limits...|$|R
