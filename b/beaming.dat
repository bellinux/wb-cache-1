Tuvok leads the Hazard Team {{to a nearby}} derelict dreadnought gunship to use the gunship's weaponry to destroy the incoming ship, but is only successful in disabling it as it attaches to Voyager. Voyager is consequently swarmed by crab-like aliens intent on carrying off crew and cargo, although the crew manages to eliminate these aliens. Munro prompts the captain to counterattack, in order to destroy the dampening field projected by the station. The Hazard Team uses the Forge's ship to infiltrate the Forge and disable its defensive systems, allowing the Voyager crew to attack using shuttlecraft; however, Crewman Biessman is killed while waiting for Voyagers reinforcements. The Forge's power core is destroyed, thereby dropping the dampening field. Munro, however, learns of the species behind the Forge, the Vohrsoth, and the station's true purpose: to harvest the genetic features of those trapped by the Forge to create an army designed for conquering the galaxy. Munro disobeys orders to ensure the Vohrsoth cannot recreate the Forge and kills the Vohrsoth commander. With power restored, Voyager attacks the Forge and destroys the station, <b>beaming</b> Munro off {{in the last few}} moments.

50|$|The <b>beam</b> {{divergence}} of a laser <b>beam</b> is {{a measure}} for how fast the <b>beam</b> expands far from the <b>beam</b> waist. It is usually defined as the derivative of the <b>beam</b> radius {{with respect to the}} axial position in the far field, i.e., in a distance from the <b>beam</b> waist which is much larger than the Rayleigh length. This definition yields a divergence half-angle. (Sometimes, full angles are used in the literature; these are twice as large.) For a diffraction-limited Gaussian <b>beam,</b> the <b>beam</b> divergence is λ/(πw0), where λ is the wavelength (in the medium) and w0 the <b>beam</b> radius (radius with 1/e2 intensity) at the <b>beam</b> waist. A large <b>beam</b> divergence for a given <b>beam</b> radius corresponds to poor <b>beam</b> quality. A low <b>beam</b> divergence can be important for applications such as pointing or free-space optical communications. <b>Beams</b> with very small divergence, i.e., with approximately constant <b>beam</b> radius over significant propagation distances, are called collimated <b>beams.</b> For the measurement of <b>beam</b> divergence, one usually measures the <b>beam</b> radius at different positions, using e.g. a <b>beam</b> profiler. It is also possible to derive the <b>beam</b> divergence from the complex amplitude profile of the <b>beam</b> in a single plane: spatial Fourier transforms deliver the distribution of transverse spatial frequencies, which are directly related to propagation angles. See US Laser Corps application note for a tutorial on how to measure the laser <b>beam</b> divergence with a lens and CCD camera.|$|R
5|$|For {{the final}} {{destruction}} of the Genesis planet, footage from the Paramount set had to be carefully matched with ILM effects footage. ILM built scale miniatures cut into sections to portray parts of Genesis' upheaval (rock slides, fissures opening in the ground) that live-action scenes could not easily replicate. One of the largest miniatures, measuring , had trick trees and trapdoors that could be reset, propane jets for gusts of fire, and solenoid-triggered rockfalls. For scenes where Kirk and Kruge battle at a precipice over a pit of lava, the shot combined animated lava, clouds (really cotton daubs on black), lightning, and a matte painting. Overhead shots of the lava were created by lighting a piece of clear Plexiglass with colored gels and covering the plate with methacyl, vermiculite and charcoal; the mixture dripped off the surface and coated the crew underneath. ILM simulated Kruge's demise, a long plunge into the pool of lava, {{with the help of}} a stop-motion puppet. Lloyd fell a few feet onto a black mattress; during a lighting flash the actor was replaced by the puppet that fell the rest of the distance. Because the shot was filmed on black instead of the traditional bluescreen, the animators had to remove or rotoscope the black background around Lloyd one frame at a time. The transition between the footage of Lloyd and the puppet was hidden by a single-frame flash as a bolt of lightning struck Kruge. The scene of Kirk and Spock <b>beaming</b> away as the ground collapses was another created at ILM, as the level of destruction was simply not possible for the live action crew.|$|E
