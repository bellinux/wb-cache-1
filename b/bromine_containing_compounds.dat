40|$|Ozone {{depletion}} events (ODEs) {{during the}} Arctic spring {{have been investigated}} since the 1980 s. It {{was found that the}} depletion of ozone is highly associated with the release of halogens, especially <b>bromine</b> <b>containing</b> <b>compounds.</b> These compounds originate from various substrates such as the ice/snow-covered surfaces in Arctic. In the present study, the dependence of the mixing ratios of ozone and principal bromine species during ODEs on the initial composition of the Arctic atmospheric boundary layer was investigated by using a concentration sensitivity analysis. This analysis was performed by implementing a reaction mechanism representing the ozone depletion and halogen release in the box model KINAL (KInetic aNALysis of reaction mechanics). The ratios between the relative change of the mixing ratios of particular species such as ozone and the variation in the initial concentration of each atmospheric component were calculated, which indicate the relative importance of each initial species in the chemical kinetic system. The results of the computations show that the impact of various chemical species is different for ozone and <b>bromine</b> <b>containing</b> <b>compounds</b> during the depletion of ozone. It was found that CH 3 CHO critically controls the time scale of the complete removal of ozone. However, the rate of the ozone loss and the maximum values of bromine species are only slightly influenced by the initial value of CH 3 CHO. In addition, according to the concentration sensitivity analysis, the reduction of initial Br 2 was found to cause a significant retardant of the ODE while the initial mixing ratio of HBr exerts minor influence on both ozone and bromine species. In addition, it is also {{interesting to note that the}} increase of C 2 H 2 would significantly raise the amount of HOBr and Br in the atmosphere while the ozone depletion is hardly changed...|$|E
40|$|To {{expand our}} {{monitoring}} focus {{and to make}} complementary additions to the POPs traditionally measured we undertook a POP screening study of human tissue representative for Swedish adults in 2007. Among the compounds assessed {{in this study are}} several classes of organohalogen contaminants, such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) and their brominated homologues (PBDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and their hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and other <b>bromine</b> <b>containing</b> <b>compounds,</b> a number of organochlorine Stockholm Convention pesticides including toxaphene, and several recently identified perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs). The analytical techniques used were based on various GC and HPLC massspectrometry applications after clean-up and fractionation of blood and adipose tissue samples. The profile of the PCDD/F in 2007 is considered to be unchanged since the 90 ’s. The shift in congener profile from BDE # 47, earlier being the dominant congener in human tissues, to BDE# 153 being dominant is confirmed in this study. Levels of PCBs are lower in this study group in relation to earlier fish consumers’ levels. Six individual PFCs were detected in the blood samples analysed. PFOS was detected at the highest concentration, with a geometric mean of 16 ng/ml, followed by PFOA, 2, 4 ng/ml, PFHxS, PFNA, PFDA and PFUnDA were present at similar levels. There is a need to further investigate individual exposures to PFCs and identify high exposure groups. Brominated PBDFs were found in human adipose at concentrations of 0. 27 - 2. 24 pg/g, being the first results on a larger material of the general population in Sweden. The screening of a larger sample seize of human adipose tissue revealed several unknown, bromine containing POPs. Both smaller and larger <b>bromine</b> <b>containing</b> <b>compounds</b> besides the known BDEs were found. Positive identification of these compounds will require authentic standards and high resolution GC/MS analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} {{of the role of}} halogen chemistry in regulating tropospheric ozone budgets was revealed in the Arctic Marine Boundary Layer (MBL) during Polar Sunrise Studies where episodic destructions of ozone were accompanied by increases in <b>bromine</b> <b>containing</b> <b>compounds.</b> Chlorine chemistry becomes especially relevant in the tropospheric MBL and in coastal regions due to the existence of elevated concentrations of chlorine generated from sea-salt aerosols. In this thesis, the kinetic study of the reactions of seven tropospherically important hydrocarbons with chlorine atoms was done at atmospheric pressure and 298 < T < 358 K using a Gas Chromatograph with Flame Ionization Detection. This data set not only compares well with available literature values but also provides a first report on several systems for which no temperature dependent kinetic data existed. Some of these reactions were found to be fast enough to compete with HO radical chemistry in the MBL. Mass spectral product studies of Cl-initiated reactions of CHBr 2 Cl and CHBr 3 indicated that halogen atoms could be recycled back to the atmosphere. The {{importance of}} these reactions on the chemistry of the troposphere is discussed...|$|E
5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the <b>bromine</b> <b>containing</b> <b>compound</b> may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} will explore {{the impact that}} both natural and anthropogenic activity has on both {{the upper and lower}} atmosphere. The impact on the upper atmosphere, specifically the ozone layer, from the introduction of chlorine and <b>bromine</b> <b>containing</b> <b>compounds</b> is a well characterized event that leads to the removal of ozone, and production of BrO radicals and O 2. Few mechanisms have been proposed for converting the BrO radical into ozone scavenging Br atoms. This work proposes two mechanisms and their accompanying kinetics that would convert BrO radicals into photolytically labile BrOH. The proposed mechanism and accompanying kinetics also help to explain the correlation that is observed between ambient ozone and formaldehyde concentrations in the Arctic. ^ Due to the destructive nature of bromine to the ozone layer, the sources of bromine atoms in the stratosphere has received considerable experimental and theoretical attention. Missing from previous studies is an evaluation of the degradation mechanism of CHBr 3 and the subsequent products from the decay of CHBr 3 under atmospheric conditions. The kinetics for the decay of CHBr 3 under atmospheric conditions as well as the spectroscopy and photochemistry of the reaction products will be reported in this work. In addition, the kinetics and spectroscopy of the degradation products of methyl formate will be presented in this work. Recommendations for further research as it pertains to the impact of hydrocarbon release in the troposphere as well as their impact on the stratosphere will be presented in the final sections of this thesis. ...|$|E

The experiments {{were carried out}} in air at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature in a 5870 liter evacuable Teflon-coated chamber with quartz end windows and a xenon arc solar simulator light source. In-situ FT-IR spectroscopy was used to monitor most reactants and products. Most experiments used dry air, except for the HBr + O 3 runs with varying humidity. Ozone was found to react with HBr with an apparent rate constant of 4 x 10 - 19 cm 3 molec - 1 s - 1, with the data suggesting that HOBr is formed in the initial reaction, but that it reacts with HBr to form Br 2, with a rate constant of at least 3. 5 x 10 - 15 cm 3 molec - 1 s - 1. Humidity affected the HBr wall loss rate but did not affect the apparent O 3 + HBr rate constant, suggesting that the reaction of HBr with O 3 may not be surface dependent. In the presence of NO x the reactions of Br 2 or HBr caused consumption or transformations of NO and NO 2 and formation of varying amounts of BrNO and BrNO 2. Attempts to model the experiments in the presence of NO x were unsuccessful. The data obtained indicated that the mechanism used in the previous study of Carter et al (1997) to account for the observed ozone reactivity of propyl bromide was incorrect, and no mechanism was found that is consistent with the data.

40|$|Materials {{of steam}} water cycles can suffer from {{corrosion}} induced by halide anions in feedwater. Organic halogen compounds in feedwater can be degraded and release halide anions under high temperature and pressure. Therefore {{it is necessary}} to be able to measure the organic halogen concentration. Existing measurements including Adsorbable Organic Halogens and Gas Chromatography are either not convenient, affordable, accurate or reproducible enough at these very low concentrations, meaning a new method should be developed. In this research the option of destroying the organic compounds to release the halide anions and measure them with ion chromatography was studied. The question is, which {{is the best way to}} destroy the organic compounds and release the halides anions. Six organic halogen model compounds were tested: aliphatic and aromatic fluorine, chlorine and <b>bromine</b> <b>containing</b> <b>compounds.</b> Two main methods were studied: UV/vacuumUV (VUV) photolysis and wet chemical oxidation with K 2 S 2 O 8. There are three phases in the research: 1. Study different UV lamps and oxidants on the target compounds and find the optimal combinations. 2. Try different dosages of K 2 S 2 O 8 and find an optimum. 3. Test halide release of target compounds in power plant conditions. In the experiments, three kinds of lamps were applied: VUV, low pressure (LP) lamp and medium pressure (MP) lamp. H 2 O 2 and TiO 2 were used as a catalyst. Last but not least, wet chemical oxidation was tested, with varying dosages of K 2 S 2 O 8. The experiments were executed with both single compounds and mixed compounds. The results show that the organic fluorine is the hardest to degrade while organic bromine is the easiest. Aromatic compounds are easier to degrade than aliphatic compounds. This happens not only in AOP process, but also in power plant conditions. The recovery of bromide and chloride in most methods could reach 95 % while aliphatic fluorine could only reach at most 70 %. It can be concluded that MP/H 2 O 2 is the most effective method for degradation of organic halogen compounds since it requires less time for the reaction to be completed, but wet chemical oxidation also showed high recoveries for all halide anions. The advantage of wet chemical oxidation is simple equipment and universality. The method with the lowest degradation rate and recovery is UV/TiO 2.

40|$|The {{tropospheric ozone}} {{depletion}} events (ODEs) {{and the related}} enhancement of reactive bromine in the boundary layer were observed in the springtime of Arctic almost 40 years ago. It is found that various substrates in polar regions such as the snowpack are able to release bromine, {{which is responsible for}} the consumption of ozone in the boundary layer. In the present simulation, a snowpack module which represents the mass transfer between the ambient air and the snowpack is implemented in a box model, aiming to clarify the influences of the snowpack on ODEs and the associated bromine explosion in the ambient air {{as well as in the}} interstitial air of the snowpack. In the snowpack module, the processes including the deposition of <b>bromine</b> <b>containing</b> <b>compounds</b> onto the snowpack, the mass exchange between the snow interstitial air and snow particles, and the release of Br 2 from the snowpack to the ambient air are parameterized by estimating the transfer resistances which an air parcel experiences when being transported through the boundary layer into the snowpack. The present model successfully captures the complete removal of ozone both in the boundary layer and in the snow interstitial air. The temporal and spatial distributions of bromine species such as Br 2 are shown and compared with observations. By changing the properties of the snowpack, it is found that the size of snow grains, volume fraction of the liquid-like layer (LLL), and the rate of the mass exchange between the snow interstitial air and the snow particles are the critical parameters which determine the occurrence of ODEs. The simulation results show that a smaller size of the snow grains considerably accelerates the ozone depletion process. Moreover, the decrease of LLL volume fraction in snow grains is found to slow down the scavenging process of HOBr by the snow particles, which prohibits the occurrence of ODEs in the snowpack. In addition, according to the simulations with the modification of the snowpack thickness, the depletion of ozone in the ambient air is shown to be influenced more heavily by the bromine explosion occurring in the surface snow layers instead of the deep snow layers. The importance of each step in the mass transfer processes occurring between the boundary layer and the snowpack is identified by conducting a local concentration sensitivity analysis. It is shown that the snow chemistry occurring in the surface snow layers has a relatively larger impact on the depletion of ozone in the ambient air compared to that within the deep snow layers. Besides, during the period of the ozone depletion, the mixing ratio of ozone in the boundary layer is mostly influenced by the deposition of HOBr onto the surface snow layers and the release of Br 2 from the snow layers close to the ground surface. In contrast to that, in the interstitial air of the surface snow layer, the uptake of HOBr by snow particles is indicated as the most dominant step for the ODE...|$|E

40|$|The {{white-tailed sea eagle}} (Haliaeetus albicilla) is {{in the top of}} {{the marine}} food chain and its {{existence}} in Sweden has been threatened several times. The species succeeded to recover from the deep decline in the 1970 s when the exposure to persistent organic pollutants influenced the reproduction negatively. The species is today spread over the country but is still seen as a near threatened species. Even though a recovery has occurred there is still some reproduction problems seen in the region of the south Bothnian Sea. The work presented in this thesis has focused on expanding the knowledge of <b>bromine</b> and chlorine <b>containing</b> <b>compounds</b> in the white-tailed sea eagles and to correlate the levels found with the reproduction impairment in the region of south Bothnian Sea. Eggs and blood from nestlings collected from different subpopulations, from the Arctic (Lapland) in the north to the Baltic Proper in the south of Sweden, have been studied for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD), dibenzofurans (PCDF), non-ortho-substituted polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), brominated flame retardants, methoxylated- (MeO-), and hydroxylated- (OH) -polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Some of the investigated compounds have been compared with levels found in a unique white-tailed sea eagle egg collected in the Baltic Proper in 1941. The pattern and levels of PCDD and PCDF in 1941 were similar and in the same range as found today around the same area. Furthermore, the human activity has raised the PCB levels in the white-tailed sea eagles with over 120 times over the last 60 years but these levels are still much lower than in the 1970 s. In conclusion none of the investigated compounds in this thesis could be correlated to the reduced reproduction seen in the south Bothnian Sea but the levels of PCDD, PCDF, non-ortho­-PCB and OH-PBDE are high in the populations inhabiting the Baltic Sea and are in the same range as found to cause different biological responses in other avian species worldwide.
