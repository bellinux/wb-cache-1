Its lyrics speak about [...] "fitting in" [...] and self-acceptance of oneself. In turn, [...] "Sweetness" [...] {{was one of the}} songs that Adkins had more doubts about because of its lyrical content: [...] "I just had this melody in my head and I was demoing it and singing it and kind of having a hard time with it. I almost didn’t bring it to the band <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> to myself, ’I can’t just say nothing. I can’t just use all these sort of alyrical whoahs for this much of a song.’" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very pretty stones," [...] {{he remarked}} carelessly, [...] "but I can't say I am {{very fond of}} them. Here's one that belonged to my sister, and my {{grandmother}} before her. I have it in my pocket <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of having the stone reset and making a present of it {{to a friend of}} mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{hesitated for}} a moment with her eyes turned to the ground, and then as she {{answered}} him she looked him full in the face. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> always <b>thinking</b> of my cousin George." ...|$|R

While you've been away from Mrs. Arty's--Lord, I've missed you so! But when I try to train with your bunch, or when you spring Matisse" [...] (he seemed peculiarly to resent the unfortunate French artist) [...] "on me I sort of get onto myself--and now it ain't like it was in England; I've {{got a bunch of}} my own I can chase around with. Anyway, I got onto myself tonight. I s'pose it's partly <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> you didn't care much for my friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your modesty {{prevented}} you. But it's a fact, nevertheless. I'm glad, <b>I</b> say, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> a lot {{along those}} lines myself, and <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> anxious to discuss the point with you. You have the most glorious hair I have ever seen!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cut {{the thing}} out <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> that the prairies, {{stretching}} {{out the way}} they do, {{make me want to}} go on and on, in an aeroplane or any old thing. Lord, Lord! I guess before long I'll have to be beating it again--like the guy in Kipling that always got sick of reading the same page too long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's fine. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> {{of going}} in, too, and I don't believe I could sleep knowing {{you were out}} here giving rein to that {{powerful}} imagination of yours. The next thing that would happen would be that you would think you saw a pink elephant sitting on the drawing-room window-sill and start throwing bricks at it.... Well, come on, Tom, the entertainment seems to be over.... But wait. The newt king wishes a word with us.... Yes, Mr. Fink-Nottle?" ...|$|E
60|$|Every moment {{people were}} passing close by us, singly, {{in two and}} threes; the {{inhabitants}} of that end of the town where life goes on unadorned by grace or splendour; they passed us in their shabby garments, with sallow faces, haggard, anxious or weary, or simply without expression, in an unsmiling sombre stream not made up of lives but of mere unconsidered existences whose joys, struggles, thoughts, sorrows and their very hopes were miserable, glamourless, and of no account in the world. And when one thought of their reality to themselves one's heart became oppressed. But of all the individuals who passed by none appeared to me for the moment so pathetic in unconscious patience as the girl standing before me; none more difficult to understand. It is perhaps <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of things which I could not ask her about.|$|E

[...] "And we can't run the risk, after that nervous attack this morning, of {{subjecting}} Blanche to any further suspense. I {{have thought of}} my niece's interests throughout this business; and if I now change my mind, and decline to agitate her by more experiments, ending (quite possibly) in more failures, it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> of her interests still. I have no other motive. However numerous my weaknesses may be, ambition to distinguish myself as a detective policeman {{is not one of}} them. The case, from the police point of view, {{is by no means a}} lost case. I drop it, nevertheless, for Blanche's sake. Instead of encouraging her thoughts to dwell on this melancholy business, we must apply the remedy suggested by our medical friend." ...|$|R

Come, I want to talk with you about your future, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> very seriously about my own. I want to ask your advice and to give you mine. I'll {{commence}} by asking yours. What do you think of me as a physician? <b>I</b> know you <b>are</b> able to judge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I did use them, my Lord, it was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> as I often do, what, after all, in {{this country}} is public life? Is it not a race in which the swiftest must surely win the prize; and is not that prize power? Has not your Lordship {{treasure}}? There is your moral steam which can work the world. Has not your Lordship's treasure most splendid consequence, pure blood and aristocratic influence? The Millionaire has in his possession the seeds of everything, but he must wait for half a century till his descendant finds himself in your Lordship's state; till he is yclept noble, and then he starts fair in the grand course. All these advantages your Lordship has apparently at hand, with the additional advantage (and one, oh! how great!) of having already proved to your country that you know how to rule." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{what can}} one do?" [...] If I {{struck her as}} a little vague it was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of another person. I indulged in another inarticulate murmur--"Poor George Gravener!" [...] What had become of the lift HE had given that interest? Later on I {{made up my mind}} that she was sore and {{stricken}} at the appearance he presented of wanting the miserable money. This was the hidden reason of her alienation. The probable sincerity, in spite of the illiberality, of his scruples about the particular use of it under discussion didn't efface the ugliness of his demand that they should buy a good house with it. Then, as for his alienation, he didn't, pardonably enough, grasp the lift Frank Saltram had given her interest in life. If a mere spectator could ask that last question, with what rage in his heart the man himself might! He wasn't, like her, I was to see, too proud to show me why he was disappointed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Really," [...] {{answered}} Inglewood, [...] "I'm afraid I've {{lost touch}} with my old friends. The greatest friend I ever had was at school, a fellow named Smith. It's odd you should mention it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of him to-day, though I haven't seen him for seven or eight years. He was on the science side with me at school-- a clever fellow though queer; and {{he went up to}} Oxford when I went to Germany. The fact is, it's rather a sad story. I often asked him to come and see me, and when I heard nothing I made inquiries, you know. I was shocked to learn that poor Smith had gone off his head. The accounts were a bit cloudy, of course, some saying that he had recovered again; but they always say that. About a year ago I got a telegram from him myself. The telegram, I'm sorry to say, put the matter beyond a doubt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, Mrs. Dr. dear, you <b>are</b> quite right. <b>I</b> did {{not think}} of it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> quite past <b>thinking</b> rationally. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just clean mad. Come in the house and I will tell you all about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very good}} of you to come," [...] she said; [...] "very good indeed. You won't find it dull, <b>I</b> hope, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> know you <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> about the same thing as these children." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It didn't {{strike me}} before," [...] he said. [...] "But, now you mention it, I can {{understand}} that <b>I</b> appear to <b>be</b> a simple sort of fellow in what is called Society here; and the reason, <b>I</b> suspect, <b>is</b> that it's not the society in which <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> accustomed to mix. The Farnabys are new to me, Rufus. When {{it comes to a}} question of my life at Tadmor, of what I saw and learnt and felt in the Community--then, I can think and speak like a reasonable being, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> and speaking of what I know thoroughly well. Hang it, make some allowance for the difference of circumstances! Besides, I'm in love, and that alters a man--and, I have heard some people say, not always for the better. Anyhow, I've done it with Farnaby, and it can't be undone. There will be no peace for me now, till I have spoken to Regina. I have read the note you left for me. Did you see her, when you called at the house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{looked across}} the {{carriage}} at its only other occupant, and our eyes met. He was a small, tired-looking man, and, as I afterwards learnt, a native of Cambridge; {{by the look of}} him, some working tradesman there, such as a journeyman tailor or a small clock-mender. In order to make conversation I said I wondered where the convicts were going. His mouth twitched with the instinctive irony of our poor, and he said: [...] "I don't s'pose they're goin' on an 'oliday at the seaside with little spades and pails." [...] I was naturally delighted, and, pursuing the same vein of literary invention, I suggested that perhaps dons were taken down to Cambridge chained together like this. And as he lived in Cambridge, and had seen several dons, he was pleased with such a scheme. Then when we had ceased to laugh, we suddenly became quite silent; and the bleak, grey eyes of the little man grew sadder and emptier than an open sea. I knew what he was thinking, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> the same, because all modern sophists are only sophists, and {{there is such a thing}} as mankind. Then at last (and it fell in as exactly as the right last note of a tune one is trying to remember) he said: [...] "Well, I s'pose we 'ave to do it." [...] And in those three things, his first speech and his silence and his second speech, there were all the three great fundamental facts of the English democracy, its profound sense of humour, its profound sense of pathos, and its profound sense of helplessness.|$|E
5000|$|The {{track was}} {{recorded}} live {{except for one}} high part on a Moog synthesizer (played by Bernie Krause of [...] "Space Odyssey" [...] with The Byrds fame). Morrison said he had [...] "asked Krause to do this thing of Chinatown and then come in with the high part <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of dragons and fireworks." [...] Krause had worked with Morrison on his previous album, Tupelo Honey, but his contribution was uncredited. Mark Naftalin's low Moog drone is noted as {{being one of the}} first times the musical device was used on the instrument in popular music, along with The Who's [...] "Baba O'Riley".|$|E

40|$|Today is {{an anniversary}} celebration for the University of Twente. Anniversaries are happy affairs; among their many functions, they bring people {{together}} who share some common connection but represent different generations of contact with that common connection. The University of Twente, as our common connection, is not old as universities go, but as an institution it is certainly {{old enough to have}} old values, and old ways of going about its business. Today, I want to think about old and new. I want to reflect about the idea of "tele-learning " as something new at the University of Twente, and I want to speculate on what it might mean for our old values, our old ways of doing things at this university. And, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> in terms of an anniversary and of celebration, I want to use a metaphor that relates to celebrating: I want to frame my thoughts around the idea of wine: old and new, mature or still fermenting, I want to expand upon two apparently contradictory parables about wine, and draw messages from these for the University of Twente, telematics, and tele-learning. 2.

5000|$|... "Almost Independence Day" [...] is a two-chord {{cycle that}} uses a Moog {{synthesizer}} and various musical and vocal techniques to translate to the listener the feelings the singer had while staring across the San Francisco harbour. Along with [...] "Listen to the Lion", {{it is more than}} ten minutes in length and has been compared to it as being as [...] "musically daring in its own way". Erik Hage describes the song as [...] "a mood piece, and a precursor to his 1980s work (particularly Common One), where his whole raison d'être became trying to inspire meditative states in the listener." [...] Speaking of this song, Morrison told Ritchie Yorke: [...] "It wasn't my concept to write a sequel to 'Madame George'. I like the song though. It was just contemplating organ and the Moog. Everything was recorded live except that one high part on the synthesiser. I asked Bernie Krause to do this thing of China Town and then come in with the high part <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of dragons and fireworks. It reminded me of that.

You wrote me weeks ago that you had finished your new novel--which information took my breath away (I mean by its windlike rush)--and now has come thus much of the remainder of the adventure for which that so grandly liberated you and which I follow with the liveliest participation in all your splendid sense of it and profit of it. I confess I take an enormous pleasure in the fact of the exposure of the sensitive plate of your imagination, your tremendous attention, to all these wonderful and terrible things. What impressions you are getting, verily--and what a breach must it all not make with the course of history you are practising up to the very eve. I rejoice that you finished and snipped off, or tucked in and wound up, something self-contained there--for how could you ever go back to it if you hadn't?--under that violence of rupture with the past which makes me ask myself what will have become of all that material we were taking for granted, and which now lies there behind us like some vast damaged cargo dumped upon a dock and unfit for human purchase or consumption. I seem to fear that I shall find myself seeing your recently concluded novel as through a glass darkly--which, however, will not prevent my immediately falling upon it when it appears; as I assume, however, that it is not now likely to do before the summer's end--by which time God knows what other monstrous chapters of history won't have <b>been</b> perpetrated!
