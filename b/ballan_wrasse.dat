This thesis investigated the establishment of captive broodstock and protocols to optimise hatchery performance and productivity of <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse.</b> High throughput sequencing was used to develop a panel of novel single nucleotide polymorphic markers (SNPs). These SNPs were used to investigate the phylogeographic structuring of <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> populations within northern geographic ranges including the UK and Norway. Results indicated fine scale population structuring within the UK suggesting that founder broodstock should be sourced locally to minimise the risk of genetic introgression with wild <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse.</b> Secondly, captive breeding was benchmarked from harems to determine total egg production over the spawning season. Data quantified the spawning periodicity and seasonal changes in egg quality parameters. In addition, microsatellite markers identified the parental contribution to each spawning event of captive broodstock. Results confirmed, for the first time, the repeat-batch spawning behaviour and suggested that spawning events were single-paired matings. Furthermore, bottlenecks in commercial production were investigated including the benthic adhesive eggs and complex spawning behaviours of <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> within broodstock tanks. Experiments were conducted to optimise the spawning dynamics and egg productivity using fragmented spawning zones and coloured substrates. Finally, an effective bath treatment for removal of the adhesive gum layer of eggs using the proteolytic enzyme alcalase® was found to assist in egg disinfection and incubation.

The edible crab (Cancer pagurus) and starfish (Asterias rubens) {{have been identified as}} the major predators, causing great losses of released scallops. In order to reduce predation by these species, a functional fence was designed to protect scallop sea ranches. The fence has greatly improved the survival rate. However, fish are not obstructed by a fence and <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Labrus bergylta) have been observed nabbing and eating on spat at a ranching site. The present study demonstrates that <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> (sized 22 to 40. 5 cm) prey on cultivated scallop spat (15 - 34 mm) and show that the predation is size specific.

These findings are important for optimising fenced sea ranching in Norway. An intermediate culture has traditionally been necessary for protection from predators during outgrow of spat to a size of about 50 mm. However, this phase is expensive and labour intensive.

40|$|The use of <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Labrus bergylta) for the {{treatment}} of salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus samonis) in salmon farming is rapidly growing due to resistance to chemical treatments. The demand for high quality and large amounts of <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> has thus {{led to the development of}} <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> farming. Due to the small size of the newly hatched larvae, the first-feeding of the larvae has become a bottleneck area. The size and nutritional properties of the live feed chosen can greatly affect both growth and development. Using copepods as live feed in the first part of the feeding regime should give a positive effect on the larval growth and development as they are the natural prey of marine fish larvae and are nutritional superior to rotifers. The aim of this study was to use 1 H-NMR to examine the differences in larval metabolic composition as a function of the different types of live feed, as well as to find the most suited method for preparation of <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> samples for metabolic analysis. To examine this, <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> larvae was fed using four different feeding regimes. The live feed used was different between the four groups for the first 30 days post hatch.

40|$|Abstract Salmon lice infestations {{are one of}} {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} for Norwegian salmon farming today. Delousing agents have been the solution to these infestations in the past, but overuse and wrong dosages have caused the lice to become resistant to the chemicals and thus rendering them ineffective. As a result cleaner fish have been proposed as an all-natural delousing agent. The <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> has been proposed as the ideal cleaner fish for Norwegian waters and is being caught in the wild and put in the fish pens with the salmon. To be able to use <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> on a larger scale and in a sustainable way, it has been proposed to begin farming of the <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse.</b> This will secure a stable supply of this fish to the salmon farms. One of the keys to successfully rearing <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> is to figure out the ideal feeding regime in the larval stage of development when the larvae are dependent on live feed. The traditional live feed of rotifers and artemia do not meet the nutritional requirements of marine fish larvae and has to be enriched to meet these requirements. Copepods has been suggested as a more suitable live feed as it is the natural prey of most wild marine fish and meets their nutritional requirements thus not needing to be enriched. In this study the traditional live feed of rotifers and artemia was compared with using intensively reared copepods (Acartia tonsa) exclusively through the whole live feed period of <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> larvae. The Rotifer-group was fed enriched rotifers from 4 dph until 30 dph, and was co-fed enriched rotifers and enriched artemia between 30 dph and 40 dph. From 40 dph until the end of the experiment (45 dph) the Rotifer-group was fed enriched artemia exclusively. The Copepod-group was fed intensively reared copepods exclusively throughout the experiment (4 - 45 dph). The <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> larvae were fed Acartia tonsa nauplii until 15 dph, then as the larvae grew they were fed copepodits from 15 dph until 30 dph. From 30 dph to 45 dph the larvae were fed a combination of copepodits and adult Acartia tonsa in a 2 : 1 ratio. The two groups were compared to see if the nutritional differences of the live prey had an effect on different growth parameters and how it affected the gut and liver development in the <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> larvae. The results from this study indicates that intensively reared Acartia tonsa was a better live feed for <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> larvae compared to enriched rotifers and enriched artemia.

40|$|Salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) infections {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{problems}} in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture. This has led to an increasing interest in the cultivation of <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Labrus bergylta), for cleaner fish purposes. The bottleneck in <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> production is the live feed period, where the main challenges include survival, growth and skeletal anomalies, factors known to be influenced by both dietary and environmental conditions. The dietary requirements for <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> larvae are generally unknown, but the use of copepods as live feed is widely acknowledged as beneficial for marine pelagic fish larval growth, survival and development, particularly due to their high content of highly saturated fatty acids incorporated in the phospholipid fraction. This study consists of two start feeding experiments of ballan wrasse; a live feed experiment and a water quality experiment. Larvae from the live feed experiment were fed either enriched rotifers (Brachionus plicatilis) followed by enriched Artemia franciscana, or cultivated copepods (Acartia tonsa) of increasing sizes until 45 days post hatch (dph). Larvae from the water quality experiment were reared in flow-through systems including a regular biofilter. One treatment received microbially matured water conditioned to the carrying capacity (CC) of the larval rearing tanks, to minimize the bloom of opportunistic bacteria following the large gap in CC between intake water and tank water. The larvae were fed enriched rotifers and Artemia until 41 dph, and formulated feed until 70 dph. One additional group was fed 50 % rotifers and 50 % preserved copepods (Planktonic) during the rotifer period. The use of copepods as live feed for <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> larvae resulted in significantly higher growth throughout the entire live feed experiment, and this was also the case for larvae reared in microbially matured water in the water quality experiment. Larvae reared in microbially matured water showed an unusually high mortality, probably due to an accidental release of H 2 S. The larvae fed live copepods had a significantly lower occurrence of skeletal anomalies than all other groups of both experiments, indicating that copepods were the optimal feed organisms for the <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> larvae.

The individuals used in salmon farms have so far derived from wildfish catches, but there is now interest in <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> aquaculture, as a more sustainable and environmental-friendly solution. During this experiment <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> larvae were fed with either enriched rotifers Brachionus sp., followed by enriched Artemia franciscana (Rot treatment) or with reared copepods Acartia tonsa (Cop treatment) until 45 day post hatch. This is probably the first study on <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> larvae with copepods as exclusive first feed. Larvae of the two treatments were compared for growth, survival and expression of seven genes (cyc 1, cox 5 a, mnsod, fxn, crls 1 and pla 2 g 6) whose encoding products are localized in the mitochondrion. All genes were related to oxidative phospholyration, with two of them being parts of the final complexes of the electron transport (cyc 1, cox 5 a). Cop larvae had a significantly higher growth during the whole experiment, while survival did not differ significantly. Gene expressions had good correlations with the larval standard length, implying that body size is more reliable than age for denoting the larval development. All genes except pla 2 g 6 were higher expressed for the Cop treatment during the first 8 days post hatch, suggesting higher mitochondrial activity and energy (ATP) generation for the initial larval period. Specifically cox 5 a expression corresponded with larval dry weight increase, implying a strong molecular effect of the initial diet quality on cellular energy generation and growth.

40|$|An {{ever-increasing}} {{demand for}} <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse,</b> {{for use as}} cleaner-fish on salmon farms, has revealed a dearth in the knowledge and literature regarding the early life history of the species and also its general population structure. Original contributions to knowledge {{are made in the}} early life history and phylogeography of <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse.</b> The research undertaken is very relevant to the aquaculture industry and fisheries management as it addresses egg and larval growth, including otolith micro- and marco-structure analyses, as well as population genetics. In examining embryonic development, it was possible to assign eight primary stages, using morphological landmarks, following standardised nomenclature. In general, embryonic development is typical of demersal marine finfish species with a short egg stage (approximately five days at ambient temperatures). In addition, hatch-time data, derived from temperature dependent developmental data from developing <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> eggs, revealed a significant negative (exponential) relationship between increasing temperature and time to hatch. Larval data, from three different hatcheries, were compared in this study, to describe typical growth. Growth was positive among all batches of larvae, with varying changes in growth rates at different points in the development of different batches. Two statistical modelling techniques were compared with one another. The analyses favour the use of the non-linear, Generalised Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs). Again, looking at larval development, the relationship between otolith diameters, standard length and larval age was examined. Lapillar diameter was the best predictor of age. Micro-incremental counts of the sagittal otoliths, from laboratory reared larvae, were undertaken as a means to validate the number of rings deposited daily. The findings indicate that a single ring is deposited daily. There was an ontogenetic shift in the relative values of somatic and otolith micro-incremental growth, which corresponded to larval stage transition points.

However, resistance and reduced sensitivity towards a large quantity of these has resulted in a blooming interest for the use of wrasse as a biological method of sea louse control. The <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Labrus bergylta) is considered the most promising species for aquaculture, but problems with poor survival, growth and skeletal deformities suggest that a suboptimal first feeding practice may be used. At present, commercial farmers first feed the <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> larvae on enriched rotifers from 4 to approximately 30 dph, followed by Artemia sp. until weaning on formulated feed is successful. Copepods are considered the natural prey of most marine fish larvae, and usually a greater larval growth, survival and development are observed when they are used as first feed instead of rotifers. This has been attributed to the copepods high fraction of essential fatty acids in their polar lipid fraction, in addition to their great amounts of protein and free amino acids. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of using intensively reared copepods (Acartia tonsa naupliii) as early live feed for the <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> larvae on the larval growth and survival, and early organ growth and development, compared to using rotifers (Brachionus ibericus). Four different feeding regimes were used, varying in the live feed provided during the first 30 days. Larvae from the “Copepod”-treatment were fed exclusively with A. tonsa during this period. Larvae from the “Cop 7 ”-treatment were fed A. tonsa from 4 to 10 dph, with a transition to enriched rotifers. Fish larvae from the “RotMG”-treatment were fed enriched rotifers the whole period, while the “RotChl”-treatment had a diet consisting of unenriched rotifers. All treatments had a transition to Artemia from 24 - 30 dph, and were weaned to formulated feed from 40 - 50 dph. Results from the present study indicated that intensively reared A. tonsa was more suitable as early live feed for <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> larvae compared to enriched or unenriched rotifers. Increased growth rates were obtained while feeding the larvae with copepods, and it resulted in larvae with significantly higher dry weight at the end of the experimental period (61 dph). No difference in larval growth was observed when feeding with enriched or unenriched rotifers, however larvae fed unenriched rotifers had a significantly lower survival than larvae from all other treatments. Higher organ volume growth rates were observed when copepods were used as feed, and the organ volumes were found to relate to the larval standard length. At 21 dph, the Copepod larvae had a significantly higher proportion of musculature than larvae from the other treatments, and the intestine appeared to be more developed and mature. </p...|$|E

40|$|<b>Ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Labrus bergylta) is a {{new species}} in aquaculture, the newly {{initiated}} intensive production {{is a response to}} the increasing demands for wrasse as cleaner fish in salmon and trout farming. The dietary requirements of the <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> larvae are largely unknown. The nutritional quality of the live feed commonly used in the farming of marine larvae today, rotifers and Artemia sp., may be suboptimal to the dietary need of developing <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> larvae, and contribute to the problems with growth, survival and skeletal anomalies currently observed in the rearing of this species. Copepods are the natural feed for pelagic marine larvae. To use intensively cultivated copepod nauplii in the farming of marine species, either as a supplement to, or instead of rotifers or Artemia sp., have lead to improved growth and normal development, earlier onset of ossification, and less skeletal anomalies. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of four different feeding regimes from 4 to 30 days post hatch (dph), on larval growth, development and quality. The larvae in the Copepod and Cop 7 treatments were fed cultivated copepod nauplii of the species Acartia tonsa from 4 to 30 dph, and from 4 to 10 dph, respectively. The larvae in the RotMG and RotChl treatments were fed enriched and unenriched rotifers (Brachionus ibericus Cayman), respectively. All groups were fed Artemia fransiscana nauplii from 24 to 51 dph, and formulated feed from 40 to 61 dph. The experiment was terminated on 61 dph. Growth and survival was recorded, and the quality difference between the larvae from the different treatments was assessed through several quality parameters; observations of larval behaviour, response to handling stress, bone ossification, and skeletal anomalies. The larvae fed copepods instead of rotifers showed better growth and stress tolerance, were more effective predators, showed earlier onset of ossification of the axial and fin ray skeleton, and had significantly less skeletal anomalies per larvae compared to the larvae fed rotifers, when the most common anomaly (twisted arches) was excluded. Larval size was consistently more related to degree of ossification than age. Growth was the parameter most notably affected by the diet, and significant differences in dry weight, standard length and myotome height was found already on 8 dph. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cleaner-fish (wrasse, Labridae) are {{increasingly}} deployed within the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) {{industry as a}} biological control against sea-lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis Krøyer). Two tank-based trials were performed to test the effect of farmed <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Labrus bergylta Ascanius) body mass and supplementary feeding on the delousing of Atlantic salmon post-smolts with an initial infection level of ∼ 12 lice salmon- 1 and a ∼ 5 % wrasse:salmon ratio. RESULTS: Sea-louse levels below 0. 5 lice salmon- 1 were obtained within 84 h, and preferential preying upon larger motile stages was found. The wrasse body mass {{and the availability of}} fresh, opened blue mussels (Mytilus edulis L.) did not significantly affect delousing efficiency. The functional predator response was linear, showing no minimum prey density threshold for sea-louse foraging and no satiation plateau, in spite of the high consumption rates measured. Sea-louse infection levels declined following a one-phase exponential decay model, with a standardised decline time constant of 0. 8 - 1. 3 % h- 1 for each wrasse stocked per 100 salmon. CONCLUSIONS: Farmed <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> are confirmed as highly effective therapeutic and preventive biological controls against sea-lice. The study supports the current minimum hatchery size target (10 mm total length) and the use of supplementary feeding to sustain the wrasse stocks in operation. The functional predator response and the standardised decline time constant of sea-louse abundance are proposed as useful indicators of delousing efficiency. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Labrus bergylta) is a {{specialized}} cleaner fish used in salmon farms as a biological treatment against sea lice. Its commercial rearing is at present mostly experimental. A {{number of key}} aspects, including the molecular and physiological mechanisms that promote its growth and development, are still largely unexplored. In this study histological, biometric, biochemical and molecular approaches are combined {{for the first time}} to investigate the changes in growth (insulin-like growth factor 1 and 2 and myostatin) and stress (heat shock protein 70 and cortisol) markers that occur during <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> larval development by relating them to larval stages and feed changes. The real-time PCR data demonstrated that igf 1 transcripts rose from 1 day post-hatching (dph) and were no longer detectable 38 dph, whereas igf 2 and myostatin transcripts were low and stable until 28 dph, then rose in late larval stages. The biometric and histological data matched the molecular findings, documenting rapid growth and development of the larval digestive tract and assimilation ability. Cortisol was lowest at hatching, it rose slightly at first feeding, and then increased during larval development; a similar trend was detected for hsp 70 gene expression. The low cortisol levels found at the earliest larval stages reflect a poor stress-coping ability, a feature that may actually protect larvae from the elevated metabolic demands involved by stress responses and promote faster growth and survival. The present data can be applied to improve the rearing performances of this important cleaner species and reduce captures from the wild. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse,</b> Labrus bergylta (Labridae), is a protogynous {{hermaphrodite}} fish {{common in}} the north-eastern Atlantic from Norway to Morocco. It is a commercially important resource for local fisheries and is currently being used as cleaner fish to control sea lice in salmon farms in northern Europe. Two distinct colour patterns have been recently reported in the literature: plain and spotted. These individuals follow strikingly different life history strategies raising {{the question of whether}} they represent one or two independent taxonomic units. Analyses of mitochondrial (18 S, COI and control region) and nuclear (S 7) markers revealed no genetic differences between these morphotypes.

40|$|Small fish larvae grow allometrically, {{but little}} is known about how this growth pattern may be {{affected}} by different growth rates and early diet quality. The present study investigates how different growth rates, caused by start-feeding with copepods or rotifers the first 30  days post-hatch (dph), affect allometric growth and development of nine major organs in <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Labrus bergylta) larvae up to experimental end at 60  dph. Feeding with cultivated copepod nauplii led to both increased larval somatic growth and faster development and growth of organ systems than feeding with rotifers. Of the organs studied, the digestive and respiratory organs increased the most in size between 4 and 8  dph, having a daily specific growth rate (SGR) between 30 and 40 % in larvae fed copepods compared with 20 % or less for rotifer-fed larvae. Muscle growth was prioritised from flexion stage and onwards, with a daily SGR close to 30 % between 21 and 33  dph regardless of treatment. All larvae demonstrated a positive linear correlation between larval standard length (SL) and increase in total tissue volume, and no difference in allometric growth pattern was found between the larval treatments. A change from positive allometric to isometric growth was observed at a SL close to 6. 0  mm, a sign associated with the start of metamorphosis. This was also where the larvae reached postflexion stage, and was accompanied by a change in growth pattern for most of the major organ systems. The first sign of a developing hepatopancreas was, however, first observed in the largest larva (17. 4  mm SL, 55  dph), indicating that the metamorphosis in <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> is a gradual process lasting from 6. 0 to at least 15 - 17  mm SL...|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{production}} of <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Labrus bergylta) as a cleaner fish {{for the removal}} of sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) from farmed salmonids (Salmo salar) has increased due to its proven efficiency. One bottleneck in commercial hatchery production is working with the benthic adhesive eggs, which makes disinfection and incubation of eggs challenging; therefore, this study aimed to find a chemical or enzymatic treatment and process to remove the adhesive gum layer. Naturally spawned eggs were collected from artificial spawning substrates up to 24 h post spawning from wild caught broodstock kept in captivity at the Marine Harvest, Machrihanish facility. Four treatments were tested: tannic acid (0. 2, 0. 1, and 0. 05 %), sodium sulfite (2, 1, and 0. 5 %),l-cysteine (2, and 1 %), and enzyme alcalase® (4. 0, 3. 0, 2. 0, 1. 0, and 0. 5 %) in vitro. Eggs were exposed for 25 min while being continually agitated, and the proportion of “degummed” eggs was counted {{at the end of each}} time period. Enzyme alcalase® was the only treatment that proved successful in degumming eggs, with the time to complete degumming (≥ 96 %) inversely related to enzyme concentration. Complete degumming occurred between 15 and 30 min for all enzyme alcalase® dose rates. Mean hatch rates for eggs treated with enzyme alcalase ® were not compromised by the treatment and in the highest dose tested were actually found to be higher in treated eggs (78. 9 ± 2. 4 %) than controls (71. 3 ± 3. 3 %). The use of enzyme alcalase® has proven effective in degumming <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> eggs without affecting hatch rates. However, translation of this method toin situdegumming and thus removal of eggs from spawning substrate on farm remains to be standardised...|$|E
40|$|This study {{confirmed}} that observations of blue-green colouration in plasma fractions of the <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> Labrus bergylta {{were caused by}} the linear tetra-pyrrole biliverdin, and that the molecule was of the physiologically relevant IXα isomer. Accumulation appears driven by chromogenic association with an unknown protein moiety which precludes enzymatic reduction and would suggest active management. It was demonstrated that the pigment did not fluctuate relative to ontogeny, or indeed binary gender in the species of interest, but mobilisation and depletion in the subset of individuals undergoing sex change {{at the time of}} study supports a potential association with gender inversion processes.

40|$|Sea lice {{continue}} {{to be one of}} the largest issues for the salmon farming industry and the use of <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Labrus bergylta) as a biological control is considered {{to be one of the}} most sustainable solutions in development. Broodstock management has proved challenging in the initial phases due to the significant lack of understanding of basic reproductive physiology and behaviour in the species. The aim of the study was to monitor captive breeding populations throughout a spawning season to examine timing and duration of spawning, quantify egg production, and look at seasonal changes in egg quality parameters as well as investigate the parental contribution to spawning events. A clear spawning rhythm was shown with 3 – 5 spawning periods inclusive of spawning windows lasting 1 – 9 days followed by interspawning intervals of 8 – 12 days. Fertilization rate remained consistently high (> 87. 5 %) over the spawning season and did not differ significantly between spawning populations. Hatch rate was variable (0 – 97. 5 %), but peaked in the middle of the spawning season. Mean oocyte diameter and gum layer thickness decreased slightly over the spawning season with no significant differences between spawning populations. Fatty acid (FA) profile of eggs remained consistent throughout the season and with the exception of high levels of ARA (3. 8 ± 0. 5 % of total FA) the FA profile was similar to that observed in other marine fish species. Parental contribution analysis showed 3 out of 6 spawning events to be single paired mating while the remaining 3 had contributions from multiple parents. Furthermore, the proposed multiple batch spawning nature of this species was confirmed with proof of a single female contributing to two separate spawning events. Overall this work represents the first comprehensive dataset of spawning activity of captive <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse,</b> and as such and will be helpful in formulating sustainable broodstock management plans for the species...|$|E
40|$|In wild <b>ballan</b> <b>wrasse</b> Labrus bergylta, mass-length {{relationships}} were not different between genders, and positive allometry {{was found in}} the mixed-gender population. Male-biased sexual size dimorphism was significant and the most effective morphometric method for sexing L. bergylta outside of the species spawning window used body mass (MB in g), total body length (LT in mm) and Fulton's condition factor (K) as discriminant variables to predict gender with 91 % accuracy. The discriminant score (SD) of a specimen can be calculated as SD = 0 · 01 MB - 0 · 016 LT - 3 · 835 K + 6 · 252 to predict its gender as female or male if SD is 1 · 504, respectively. There was a potential trend towards earlier sexual inversion compared to previous studies at comparable latitudes.
