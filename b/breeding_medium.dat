The experiment also proposed to compare among and within family and combined selection strategies. Ten plots of sexual plants were randomly distributed among 230 plots of apomictic accessions. After natural pollination, seeds of each sexual plant constituted a half-sib family. Thirty plants of each female progenitor were evaluated in a randomized block design experiment, with five plants per plot and five replications. Five evaluation harvests were made in the rainy seasons and two in the dry seasons of all plants. The production and quality characteristics were evaluated. The selection criteria used was: among and within family selection and combined selection with 50 % selection in both. The selection criteria used (among and within family selection and combined selection), were efficient for use in P. maximum <b>breeding,</b> with <b>medium</b> to high gains for most characteristics evaluated. The highest genetic gains were obtained from combined selection. However, among and within family selection promoted high genetic gains and may be used in P. maximum breeding.

40|$|Polyunsaturated {{fatty acids}} (PUFAs) are {{essential}} nutrients for animals and {{necessary for the}} normal functioning of the nervous system. A lack of PUFAs can result from the consumption of a deficient diet or genetic factors, which impact PUFA uptake and metabolism. Both can cause synaptic dysfunction, which is associated with numerous disorders. However, there is a knowledge gap linking these neuronal dysfunctions and their underlying molecular mechanisms. Because of its genetic manipulability and its easy, fast, and cheap breeding, Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as an excellent model organism for genetic screens, helping to identify the genetic bases of such events. As a first step towards the understanding of PUFA implications in Drosophila synaptic physiology we designed a <b>breeding</b> <b>medium</b> containing only very low amounts of PUFAs. We then used the fly’s visual system, a well-established model for studying signal transmission and neurological disorders, to measure {{the effects of a}} PUFA deficiency on synaptic function. Using both visual performance and eye electrophysiology, we found that PUFA deficiency strongly affected synaptic transmission in the fly’s visual system. These defects were rescued by diets containing omega- 3 or omega- 6 PUFAs alone or in combination. In summary, manipulating PUFA contents in the fly’s diet was powerful to investigate the role of these nutrients on the fly´s visual synaptic function. This study aims at showing how the first visual synapse of Drosophila can serve as a simple model to study the effects of PUFAs on synapse function. A similar approach could be further used to screen for genetic factors underlying the molecular mechanisms of synaptic dysfunctions associated with altered PUFA levels...|$|E

The availability of an efficient somatic embryogenesis process would allow the rapid mass production of heterozygous materials such as selected Coffea canephora clones and F 1 Arabica hybrid varieties. For the last fifteen years, bioreactors (mechanically or pneumatically agitated bioreactors, temporary immersion bioreactors) have mostly been used on coffee to optimize the mass regeneration of somatic embryos from embryogenic tissues. This review presents the main results, obtained with several bioreactor models, concerning the different steps of the micropropagation process: i) the multiplication of embryogenic tissues, ii) the somatic embryo mass regeneration and iii) the production of pre-germinated embryos and plantlets in bioreactors. The literature shows that scaling-up can be successful, since very efficient embryo production has been achieved for both C. arabica and C. canephora. Moreover, it was proven that the pre-germinated coffee embryos – i. e. embryonic axis elongation (10 - 12 mm), root tip formation, cotyledon expansion and greening- obtained in temporary immersion bioreactors were photoautotrophic and able to regenerate vigorous plantlets after sowing under nursery conditions. The feasibility to apply the bioreactor technology in an industrial micropropagation procedure is also discussed in the particular socio−economic context of coffee growing.

40|$|Arapaima gigas {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{freshwater}} fishes of the world. It is socially monogamous, forming pairs, constructing a nest and providing parental care. We performed a paternity analysis under three scenarios in captive, semi-natural and natural areas using 10 microsatellite markers.

We then analyzed two samples of offspring from large artificial ponds with multiple adults but only one reproductive pair (a priori high probability of monogamy), two samples from semi-natural breeding station with multiple adults but only one reproductive pair (a priori high probability of monogamy), and a sample from a natural lake with multiple adults, some potentially <b>breeding</b> (a priori <b>medium</b> probability of monogamy).

40|$|Long-term {{studies of}} animal life {{histories}} and demography have been key in advancing {{our understanding of}} the processed that shape behaviour and population dynamics of species. The Eurasian beaver Castor fiber is a good species in which to study these processes, as it is long-lived, social and territorial. The species is also important to general conservation biology due to its key stone effects on wetland and riparian habitat. In this thesis, I use a 12 year capture-mark-recapture program on a beaver population in Telemark, southern Norway, in conjunction with behavioural, habitat and climate observations to examine life history strategies, demography and territoriality. I examined growth rates of juveniles and showed, for the first time, that beavers exhibit compensatory growth for body size. Juvenile beavers that were smaller than same-age peers managed to narrow the gap in size by trading-off gain in body condition against gain in size. Examining the effects of body size and condition on survival and dominance, I find for the first time evidence that larger, though not heavier for their size, individuals are more likely to obtain dominant <b>breeding</b> positions. <b>Medium</b> size individuals and those with medium body condition suffer less mortality. The largest of the medium sized animals go on to obtain breeding positions within the population. Thus compensatory size growth in beavers has evolved because selection acts through dominance to increase size, but this size increase is stabilised through selection on survival. Examining the effects of age on fecundity I show, for the first time, that after an initial increase to 4 – 6 years (minimum age), beavers exhibit reproductive senescence. I also show for the first time that, apart from exhibiting higher fecundity, females in higher quality territories begin reproductive senescence later. I argue that this supports the disposable soma hypothesis of senescence and not the antagonistic genetic pleiotropy hypothesis. I furthermore examine trade-offs in offspring quantity versus quality and show that this trade-off only exists in younger (< 7 years minimum age) mothers, indicating support for both the experience and the terminal investment hypotheses. Investigating the effects of weather on body weight and fecundity I show that that rainfall negatively affected both fecundity and body weight. Examine tree growth-rings, I was able to establish that close to water level (< 0. 5 m) high rainfall suppresses tree growth. Thus higher rainfall can reduce forage availability near water. I also found that cold winters reduced the body weight in young (< 2 year old) beavers and rapid phenological advancement associated with warm spring temperatures reduced adult body weight, confirming previous studies on other species. Exploring the effects of weather variability on recruitment and survival, I show that high seasonal amplitude in air temperature and low short-term temperature variability led to an increase in recruitment and low variability in rainfall combined with low short-term temperature variability increased survival. Overall, weather variability may have a greater influence on vital rates in this beaver population than absolute weather conditions. Investigating territoriality and the propensity of offspring to remain within the natal group, I show that a repacking of territories due to mortality and group fission has reduced a previous imbalance in territory quality. After repacking, territories were more clearly configured around the dispersion of resources. Philopatric tendencies are greater in territories with more resources but their presence results in greater resource depletion...|$|R
40|$|Breeding {{programmes}} for livestock require economic weights for {{traits that}} reflect the most profitable animal in a given production system, which affect the response in each trait after selection. The profitability of sheep production systems is affected by changes in pasture growth as well as grain, meat and wool prices between seasons and across years. Annual pasture growth varies between regions within Australia’s Mediterranean climate zone from low growth with long periods of drought to high growth with shorter periods of drought. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to assess whether breeding objectives need to be adapted for regions, depending on how reliable the pasture growth is across years. We modelled farms with Merino sheep bred for wool and meat in 10 regions in Western Australia. Across these 10 regions, mean annual pasture growth decreased, and the CV of annual pasture growth increased as pasture growth for regions became less reliable. We calculated economic values for nine traits, optimising management across 11 years, including variation for pasture growth and wool, meat and grain prices between and within years from 2002 to 2012. These economic values were used to calculate responses to selection for each trait for the 10 regions. We identified two potential breeding objectives, one for regions with low or high reliability and the other for regions with medium reliability of pasture growth. Breeding objectives for high or low pasture growth reliability had more emphasis on live weight traits and number of lambs weaned. <b>Breeding</b> objectives for <b>medium</b> reliability of pasture growth had more emphasis on decreasing fibre diameter. Relative economic weights for fleece weight did not change across the regions. Regions with low or high pasture reliability had similar breeding objectives and response to selection, because the relationship between the economic values and CV of pasture growth were not linear for live weight traits and the number of lambs weaned. This non-linearity was caused by differences in distribution of pasture growth between regions, particularly during summer and autumn, when ewes were pregnant, with increases in energy requirements affecting the value of lambs weaned. In addition, increasing live weight increased the intake capacity of sheep, which meant that more poor quality pasture could be consumed during summer and autumn, which had more value in regions with low and high pasture reliability. We concluded that breeding values for sheep production systems should be customised depending on the reliability of pasture growth between years...|$|R

As a solid substrate we used three different sizes of wheat, which were obtained by using sieve analysis. We also carried out the test for determining the humidity of the substrate on which we defined the optimal 80 % humidity. In the second part we carried out the cultivation of fungi on a solid substrate, and monitored the weight gain of the fungus P. ostreatus depending on the particle size of wheat bran {{and the time of}} incubation.

40|$|While {{breeding}} {{for organic}} farming {{it is necessary}} to identify the most appropriate growing conditions in which to perform the selection process. Soil fertility, crop management, yield level and other factors may vary very much between each organic farm, and between organic farms and research institutions where the selection is usually performed. Since plant breeding requires considerable input of resources and the market for organic varieties is limited, it is essential to find the most appropriate selection conditions that will provide acceptable varieties for organic farms. Spring barley breeding lines selected from two cross combinations (Primus/Idumeja and Anni/Dziugiai) at two distinctive organic and two conventional locations were used in the study. The organic location 1 was situated in a research field of the plant breeding institute (with green manure as fertilizer), the organic location 2 included an organic farmer’s field (with stable manure as fertilizer), the conventional location 1 was located in a barley <b>breeding</b> field (with <b>medium</b> level of mineral fertilizer input) and the conventional location 2 in a seed production field of the institute (with high mineral fertilizer input). Selection of the breeding lines was done under the respective growing conditions starting from F 3 generation. Most appropriate lines for growing in organic farming were selected at all 4 environments. Selected breeding lines were evaluated in F 5 (n= 20 - 23 per cross combination, without replications) and F 6 generations (n= 10 per cross combination, 3 replications). Correlations between barley traits and the environments and cross combinations will be compared in the presentation. The analysis of the correlation between grain yield and observed plant traits of F 5 lines indicated that tendencies between the lines obtained from both cross combinations as well as between the environments were dissimilar in most of the cases. Soil shading (evaluated at early stem elongation stage) correlated positively with grain yield in all cases; the correlation was always significant for lines from the cross Primus/Idumeja, but only at the conventional location 2 for Anni/Dziugiai lines (p< 0. 05). A significant positive correlation between grain yield and plant development speed at tillering stage as well as between yield and plant height at the beginning of stem elongation was found for Primus/Idumeja lines at both organic locations and at the conventional location 1 (p< 0. 05). Plant height before harvest did not correlate significantly with yield under organic conditions which is in contradiction with some other studies.

40|$|The aims of {{the study}} were to examine some {{population}} parameters of the Common Guillemot Uria aalge on Skomer Island, Wales, where a decline in numbers has occurred, and to examine a number of different aspects of the birds' breeding biology. The Common Guillemot {{is one of the most}} numerous seabirds in the northern hemisphere and breeds at densities unparalleled by any other bird species. Chapter 2 describes some Guillemot population parameters on Skomer. Between 1934 and 1975 a 62 % decrease in numbers took place. The population may have stabilized during the course of this study and the population in 1975 was estimated at about 2, 200 pairs. Breeding success over three years averaged 70 %, adult survival was 93 % in 1974 and 88 % in 1975. The age at which Common Guillemots start to breed is not known, but is assumed to be similar to other auks, i. e. about 5 years. Survival rates of birds up to five years derived from recoveries of ringed birds varied between 27 - 41 % in different areas. High adult mortality, as in 1975, caused by chronic oil pollution may be limiting the Skomer population at present. Chapter 3 investigates the adaptive nature of high density nesting. Breeding success was highest among those Guillemots nesting at high densities on broad ledges, and was lowest among those on broad ledges at low densities. Breeding success was related to the synchrony of laying; dense groups had a shorter spread of laying than sparse groups, and a short spread of laying minimized the number of birds at the beginning and end of the season whose breeding was out of phase with the rest. Birds which were out of phase suffered higher losses of eggs and chicks, mainly through gull predation. Photographs of Skomer Guillemot colonies taken in 1934 show that at that time most available ledge-space was occupied and birds bred on both broad and narrow ledges. In 1973 - 1975 relatively few birds nested on broad ledges, most were on narrow ledges at Medium densities. It is suggested that as the population declined the density of birds on broad ledges also decreased, resulting in increased predation and reduced <b>breeding</b> success. Because <b>Medium</b> density groups on narrow ledges are more productive than low density groups on broad ledges, Medium density groups have persisted. Guillemots apparently do not have the ability to coalesce into a few high density groups. Chapter 4 describes how adult Guillemots provision their chick, and the development of the chick to fledging. Comparisons are made with other auk studies, and Guillemot chicks on Skomer show similar growth rates and fledge at similar weights to Guillemots in other areas. Chapter 5 describes the social behaviour of the Common Guillemot, which generally nests in bodily contact with conspecifics, and comparisons are made with the Razorbill, which spaces itself away from conspecifics at the breeding colony. Behavioural adaptations to high density nesting in the Guillemot are pinpointed. Guillemots perform a large number of appeasement displays; active appeasement displays are performed in response to a threat or attack, and passive appeasement to avoid eliciting aggression. Razorbills possess a smaller repertoire of social signals than Common Guillemots. In Chapter 6 I have drawn together information from previous chapters, and from Appendix II, on moult, and have tried to outline the inter-relationships between several different aspects of the Guillemot's biology, in terms of its overall adaptiveness. </p...|$|R
