2500|$|Disco fashions {{were very}} trendy {{in the late}} 1970s. Discothèque-goers often wore glamorous, {{expensive}} and extravagant fashions for nights out at their local disco club.

40|$|With {{industrial}} progress, the advancements in garment manufacturing {{have evolved}} from cut & sew to complete garment knitting, which produces one entire garment without sewing or linking process. Seamless knitting technology {{is similar to}} sock manufacture, the specialized circular knitting machines producing 3 dimensional garments with no side seams, with the waistband integrated with body of the garment and with knitted washing instructions and logos. The paper starts by presenting the main advantages of seamless garments but also some limitations because the technology. Because for a seamless garment, which is realized as a knitted tub, {{is very important to}} ensure the required final chest size, it was presented the main components involved: the knitting machine, the garment design and the yarns used. The knitting machines, beside the values of diameters and gauges with a great impact on the chest size, are characterized by a very innovative and complex construction. The design of a seamless garment is fundamental different compared to garments produced on a traditional way because the designer must to work backwards from a finished garment to create the knitting programme that will ultimately give the correct finished size. On the end of the paper it was presented some of the applications of the seamless products that cover intimate apparel and other <b>bodywear,</b> outwear, activewear and functional sportswear, upholstery, industrial, automotive and medical textiles...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} EU funded {{research}} project THERMPROTECT ('Thermal properties of protective clothing and their use') this paper deals with manikin experiments {{on the effects of}} heat radiation at different wind speeds, considering aspects related to the reflectivity of the clothing. A heated thermal manikin 'Newton' was operated with a constant surface temperature of 34 °C standing in a climatic chamber. The manikin was placed in a wind tunnel, with fans sucking the air through the tunnel and the manikin facing the wind and the radiation. To ensure proper operation of the manikins heating mechanism the experiments were carried out at a low air temperature (Ta) of 6 °C with 50 % relative humidity. Four wind speeds (0. 5 m/s, 1. 0 m/s, 2. 0 m/s and 5. 0 m/s) were used. The manikin wore four different outer wears (Black Laminated Nomex, Black Nomex, Orange Nomex and Reflective Nomex). All clothing had equal design. Identical underwear was worn in all trials (Helly Hansen super <b>bodywear).</b> Two THORN compact high intensity floodlight for PAR 64 sealed beam CSI lamps were used in the tests as the radiant source. Lamps were set at a distance of 1. 5 metres away from the manikin for high radiation level (± 450 W/m 2) and 2. 0 meters for medium level (± 325 W/m 2). The results showed a decrease in whole body heat loss, i. e. heat gain for the conditions with radiant heat stress compared to the reference without radiation. With wind, the heat gain decreased. Except for the reflective suit, the influence of the material and colour of the outer garment on radiant heat gains was negligible. The reflective suit showed the lowest heat gain. Increased heat loss by wind compensated for the radiant heat gains, with an effect size similar for all suits up to 2 m/s wind. Above this speed the wind effect on the reflective suit was smaller than for the others. The data obtained can be used to predict heat gain of humans by radiation in the presence of air movement...|$|E

The show featured {{a variety of}} wearable computers, head-mounted displays, smart clothes, luminous clothing and accessories, futuristic club wear, and CAD/CAM jewellery and <b>bodywear.</b> It also featured contributions from the Banff New Media Institute, the MIT Media Lab, WIN Wearable Fashion Group, ViewStation, (whisper research group), the Wearable Fashion Group at Keio University, SONY CSL Paris, The Innovation Centre @ Central St. Martin's College of Art and Design, CuteCircuit, eMagin, Elise Co, Tina Gonsalves, Laura Bardier, {{and a number of}} other experimental artists, progressive designers, and hi-tech corporations. The wide-ranging selection of products, innovative prototypes, and unique creations projected the future realms of body-technology assimilation. Scent Whisper ‘Scent Whisper’ is a wireless jewellery set inspired by the comic hero Spiderman. It can be worn by two people and works by the first user whispering a secret into the spider’s abdomen which has a humidity sensor embedded in a brooch. A message is ‘scent by a wireless web’ to a the second user wearing a wireless bombardier beetle brooch. The beetle brooch retaliates by spraying a scent (or poison) to a lover (or enemy) dependent upon the response from the humidity sensor embedded in the spider. This jewellery device is able to dispense airborne nano-litre sized droplets of fragrance at about 20, 000 droplets per second using lab-on-a-chip technology that allows efficient scent delivery SmartSecondSkin The SmartSecondSkin Dress is a conceptual garment that concentrates on a more active approach to fashion offering direct life-enhancing and analgesic assistance through different mechanisms’ whilst soothing, stimulating, motivating or invigorating the wearer. The dress demonstrates a new way to deliver fragrances for health, wellbeing and stress-reduction. It mimics the human body, in particular the circulation and nervous system, senses and scent glands. The dress interacts with human emotions whereby the aroma dimension is an integral part of the wearer’s sensory experience. It is made from two layers of while organza silk with medical tubes in-between, containing coloured liquid that demonstrate a selection of different fragrances embedded within the garment. The fragrances are diffused depending on the different moods and emotions of the user. The tubes represent an “aroma rainbow”, so that the fabric gives the impression it is creating an olfactory experience. The fundamental advantage is the use of body sensors to determine ‘colour therapeutic’ scent release when a person is stressed, with the ability to shield a ‘Scentient Being’ (the user) from a negative mood they should be protected from. The benefits are for everyone, as recent research shows that fragrance has a positive effect on brain activity to improve mental and physical health. The dress therefore enhances mental and physical well-being, whilst acting as a medium for communicating thoughts or emotions through smell, our most ancient and primitive sense...|$|E
