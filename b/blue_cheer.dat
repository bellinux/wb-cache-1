5|$|Heavy metal {{is a form}} {{of music}} {{characterized}} by aggressive, driving rhythms and highly amplified distorted guitars, generally with grandiose lyrics and virtuosic instrumentation. Heavy metal is a development of blues, blues rock, rock and prog rock. Its origins lie in the British hard rock bands who between 1967 and 1974 took blues and rock and created a hybrid with a heavy, guitar-and-drums-centered sound. Most of the pioneers in the field, like Black Sabbath, were English, though many were inspired by American performers like <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer</b> and Jimi Hendrix.|$|E
25|$|Formed in {{the early}} 1970s, this scene was kickstarted by Pentagram. Various doom/stoner bands, mostly from Maryland and Virginia, formed in this region, being heavily {{influenced}} by early Hard rock/Heavy metal bands, like UFO, <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer,</b> Black Sabbath, Uriah Heep and Sir Lord Baltimore. Notable bands include The Obsessed, Saint Vitus, Evoken, Internal Void, Spirit Caravan, Earthride and The Hidden Hand.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the release}} of the debut, Yahoo! critic Rob O'Connor noted them as number 15 on his list of 'The Greatest Australian Acts' on his 'List of the Day' blog. Furthermore, he {{compared}} their sound to be more reminiscent of psychedelic rock bands like <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer,</b> Toe Fat Revival, Bloodrock and Frijid Pink, rather than comparing them to straight forward hard rock bands like Black Sabbath.|$|E

25|$|Danzig {{was born}} Glenn Allen Anzalone, {{the third of}} four sons born to a Protestant family of Italian, German, and Scottish {{heritage}} in Lodi, New Jersey. His father was a television repairman and a United States Marine Corps veteran of World War II and the Korean War. His mother worked at a record store. Danzig and his family also spent some time living in Revere, Massachusetts. Danzig began listening to heavy music at an early age, and has described Black Sabbath, <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer</b> and The Doors as being among his early musical influences.|$|E
25|$|Aside from Pentagram and Black Sabbath, {{other groups}} from the 70s would heavily {{influence}} the genre's development. <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer</b> is often hailed {{as one of}} the first stoner metal bands. Through the use of loud amplifiers and guitar feedback, their debut Vincebus Eruptum created a template for other artists to follow. Though lacking the pessimistic lyrical content of their contemporaries, Welsh heavy metal band Budgie would also produce heavy songs which were amongst the loudest of their day, stylistically influencing various doom metal acts. Early doom metal was also influenced by Japan's Flower Travellin' Band, particularly their albums Kirikyogen and Satori. Other notable groups include Sir Lord Baltimore, Buffalo, Bang, Necromandus, Lucifer's Friend, Jacula, Iron Claw and Leaf Hound.|$|E
25|$|Heavy psych - Bands like Iron Butterfly, Steppenwolf, <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer,</b> Sir Lord Baltimore, Mount Rushmore, Morgen, Blue Öyster Cult, Yesterday's Children, Andromeda, Edgar Broughton Band, High Tide, Josefus, Captain Beyond, Frijid Pink, Third Power, Morly Grey, The Illusion, Attila, May Blitz, Pink Fairies, The Open Mind, Crow, The Litter, Mason, Toe Fat, Stack Waddy, Leaf Hound, Buffalo, Kahvas Jute, Baumstam, Flower Travellin' Band, Blues Creation, Speed, Glue & Shinki, JPT Scare Band, Truth and Janey {{and also}} some early {{material}} by Grand Funk Railroad, Mountain, MC5 and The Stooges mixed psychedelic/acid blues rock with some heavier sounds between the late 60s and early 70s. Even if {{some of them have}} gained some mainstream attention, most of them were underground bands and they were re-discovered by collectionists and stoner rock fans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer's</b> {{video for}} Summertime Blues made an {{appearance}} in 2005 documentary Metal: A Headbanger's Journey, where Geddy Lee of Rush {{referred to the}} group {{as one of the}} first heavy metal bands.|$|R
50|$|Stephens has {{recorded}} two albums with the band, Vincebus Eruptum and Outsideinside. He has {{claimed to have}} been {{the only member of the}} band who did not use drugs. His replacement as <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer's</b> lead guitarist was Randy Holden.|$|R
25|$|Hasselvander's solo project The Hounds of Hasselvander {{released}} an album in 2007.

500|$|Groups {{that emerged}} from the American {{psychedelic}} scene about the same time included Iron Butterfly, MC5, <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer</b> and Vanilla Fudge. San Francisco band <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer</b> released a crude and distorted cover of Eddie Cochran's classic [...] "Summertime Blues", from their 1968 debut album Vincebus Eruptum, that outlined much of the later hard rock and heavy metal sound. The same month, Steppenwolf released its self-titled debut album, including [...] "Born to Be Wild", which contained the first lyrical reference to heavy metal and helped popularise the style when it was used in the film Easy Rider (1969). Iron Butterfly's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (1968), with its 17-minute-long title track, using organs and with a lengthy drum solo, also prefigured later elements of the sound.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{disagree}} {{over who}} {{can be thought of}} as the first heavy metal band. Most credit either Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath, with American commentators tending to favour Led Zeppelin and British commentators tending to favour Black Sabbath, though many give equal credit to both. A few commentators—mainly American—argue for other groups including Iron Butterfly, Steppenwolf or <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer.</b> Deep Purple, the third band in what is sometimes considered the [...] "unholy trinity" [...] of heavy metal (Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Deep Purple), despite being slightly older than Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, fluctuated between many rock styles until late 1969 when they took a heavy metal direction.|$|E
500|$|The first {{documented}} use of {{the phrase}} to describe a type of rock music identified to date appears in a review by Barry Gifford. In the May 11, 1968, issue of Rolling Stone, he wrote about the album A Long Time Comin' by U.S. band Electric Flag: [...] "Nobody who's been listening to Mike Bloomfield—either talking or playing—in {{the last few years}} could have expected this. This is the new soul music, the synthesis of white blues and heavy metal rock." [...] In January 1970 Lucian K. Truscott IV reviewing Led Zeppelin II for the Village Voice described the sound as [...] "heavy" [...] and made comparisons with <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer</b> and Vanilla Fudge.|$|E

50|$|Snake Nation was a band {{consisting}} of Corrosion of Conformity members Mike Dean and Woody Weatherman, along with comic artist Brian Walsby on drums. While C.O.C. was on hiatus in 1989, Snake Nation released one album on Caroline Records. The music was {{a blend of}} the aggressive hardcore of Animosity-era C.O.C. with a slower, heavier Black Sabbath influence. The album features a cover of <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer's</b> Babylon.|$|R
500|$|Many bands, {{primarily}} in the rock genre, use excessive volumes intentionally. Several bands have set records as the loudest band in the world, with Deep Purple, The Who, and Manowar having received entries in the Guinness Book of World Records. Other claimants to the title include Motörhead, Led Zeppelin, <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer,</b> Gallows, Bob Dylan's 1965 backing electric band, Grand Funk Railroad, Canned Heat, and the largely fictional parody group Spinal Tap. My Bloody Valentine {{are known for their}} [...] "legendarily high" [...] volume concerts, and Sunn O))) are described as surpassing them. The sound levels at Sunn O))) concerts are intentionally loud enough that they are noted for having physical effects on their audience.|$|E
500|$|The Sword {{has been}} {{categorised}} as doom metal and {{identified as an}} example of the 'classic metal' movement of stoner rock artists influenced by early metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer.</b> With the release of Warp Riders, members of the band acknowledged that fans with a more [...] "narrow-minded" [...] view of heavy metal may feel alienated by stylistic changes. Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic described the band on Age of Winters as being [...] "at the forefront of … the 'heritage' or 'retro metal' movement," [...] comparing their style to that of heavy metal veterans Black Sabbath and vocalist Cronise to Ozzy Osbourne. Rolling Stone has also likened the band to Sabbath.|$|E
500|$|In live performance, loudness—an [...] "onslaught of sound," [...] in {{sociologist}} Deena Weinstein's description—is considered vital. In {{his book}} Metalheads, psychologist Jeffrey Arnett refers to heavy metal concerts as [...] "the sensory equivalent of war." [...] Following the lead set by Jimi Hendrix, Cream and The Who, early heavy metal acts such as <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer</b> set new benchmarks for volume. As Blue Cheer's Dick Peterson put it, [...] "All we knew was we wanted more power." [...] A 1977 {{review of a}} Motörhead concert noted how [...] "excessive volume in particular figured into the band's impact." [...] Weinstein makes the case that {{in the same way}} that melody is the main element of pop and rhythm is the main focus of house music, powerful sound, timbre, and volume are the key elements of metal. She argues that the loudness is designed to [...] "sweep the listener into the sound" [...] and to provide a [...] "shot of youthful vitality".|$|E
50|$|Cron also acted, {{appearing}} in notable {{films such as}} Stir Crazy and Diner, as well as Soup for One, Running Brave and Aspen Extreme. She guest starred on several television shows including L.A. Law, Hill Street <b>Blues,</b> <b>Cheers,</b> Remington Steele, and Magnum P.I.. Additionally, Claudia acted in many movies for television such as Obsessed with a Married Woman with Tim Matheson and Sunday Drive with Tony Randall and Carrie Fisher.|$|R
5000|$|Outsideinside is <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer's</b> second LP, {{released}} by Philips Records in August 1968. Its tracks were recorded both outdoors and indoors—hence {{the title of}} the album. The record's tracks feature contributions from all members, along with two covers: [...] "Satisfaction" [...] by The Rolling Stones and [...] "The Hunter" [...] by Albert King. The album was re-released on CD in 1999 by Italian-based Akarma Records, and included an additional cut from the original sessions entitled [...] "Fortunes" [...] as a bonus track.|$|R
50|$|The top {{shows of}} the night were Cheers and Hill Street <b>Blues.</b> <b>Cheers</b> won its second {{straight}} Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, while Hill Street Blues made history. It became the first show to win the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series four consecutive years, this record still stands today, but has been tied twice, by The West Wing and Mad Men. Hill Street Blues also added to another streak, it received at least 14 major nominations for the fourth straight year, winning four. Cheers received the most nominations on the comedy side (10), winning three.|$|R
500|$|Blues for the Red Sun {{incorporates}} acid rock, grunge, psychedelic rock, space rock, and doom metal, and {{has been}} compared to such acts as Black Sabbath, Hawkwind, <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer,</b> and Alice in Chains. The album is considered a pioneer to the stoner metal genre. Daniel Bukszpan, the author of The Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal, has written that the album has influenced [...] "countless" [...] bands. Many consider Blues for the Red Sun [...] "the template for 21st-century bands that have followed in the pioneering wake of Kyuss". Martin Popoff similarly credits the band with the creation of a [...] "certain core sample" [...] of stoner rock, in part due to an [...] "uncompromising bassquake" [...] that was composed of more than [...] "tar-pitted Sabbath riffs". Exclaim! credited the album for opening [...] "the way for bands like Monster Magnet and a whole host of other desert grunge practitioners". Melissa Auf der Maur has said that she attempted to [...] "knock-off" [...] Blues for the Red Sun for her single [...] "Followed the Waves", to the point that she recruited the band's rhythm section to play on the track and Chris Goss to produce. Other fans of the album include Dave Grohl and Metallica.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, {{the sound}} that would become known as heavy metal began to coalesce. That January, the San Francisco band <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer</b> {{released}} a cover of Eddie Cochran's classic [...] "Summertime Blues", from their debut album Vincebus Eruptum, that many consider the first true heavy metal recording. The same month, Steppenwolf released its self-titled debut album, including [...] "Born to Be Wild", which refers to [...] "heavy metal thunder" [...] in describing a motorcycle. In July, the Jeff Beck Group, whose leader had preceded Page as The Yardbirds' guitarist, released its debut record: Truth featured some of the [...] "most molten, barbed, downright funny noises of all time," [...] breaking ground for generations of metal ax-slingers. In September, Page's new band, Led Zeppelin, made its live debut in Denmark (billed as The New Yardbirds). The Beatles' White Album, released the following month, included [...] "Helter Skelter", {{then one of the}} heaviest-sounding songs ever released by a major band. The Pretty Things' rock opera S.F. Sorrow, released in December, featured [...] "proto heavy metal" [...] songs such as [...] "Old Man Going" [...] and [...] "I See You". Iron Butterfly's 1968 song [...] "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" [...] is sometimes described {{as an example of the}} transition between acid rock and heavy metal or the turning point in which acid rock became [...] "heavy metal", and both Iron Butterfly's 1968 album In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida and Blue Cheer's 1968 album Vincebus Eruptum have been described as laying the foundation of heavy metal and greatly influential in the transformation of acid rock into heavy metal.|$|E
500|$|The Pumpkins drew {{inspiration}} {{from a variety of}} other genres, some unfashionable during the 1990s among music critics. Corgan in particular was open about his appreciation of heavy metal, citing Dimebag Darrell of Pantera as his favorite contemporary guitarist. When one interviewer commented to Corgan and Iha that [...] "Smashing Pumpkins is one of the groups that relegitimized heavy metal" [...] and that they [...] "were among the first alternative rockers to mention people like Ozzy and Black Sabbath with anything other than contempt". Corgan went on to rave about Black Sabbath's Master of Reality and Judas Priest's Unleashed in the East. The song [...] "Zero", which reminded Iha of Judas Priest, is an example of what the band dubbed [...] "cybermetal." [...] Post-punk and gothic rock bands like Joy Division/New Order, Bauhaus, The Cure, and Depeche Mode were formative influences on the band, which covered such artists in concert and on record. Corgan also cited Siouxsie and the Banshees [...] saying it was important to point back to bands that influenced them. Psychedelic rock was also referenced often in the band's early recordings; according to Corgan, [...] "In typical Pumpkins fashion, no one at that point really liked loud guitars or psychedelic music so, of course, that's exactly what we had to do." [...] Corgan acknowledged that a chord he jokingly claimed as [...] "the Pumpkin chord" [...] (a G# octave chord at the eleventh fret of a guitar with the low E string played over it), used as the basis for [...] "Cherub Rock", [...] "Drown", and other songs, was in fact previously used by Jimi Hendrix. Other early influences cited by Corgan include Cream, The Stooges, and <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer.</b>|$|E

In the 1960s, the heavy, blues-influenced, psychedelic hard rock sound of bands such as the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Deep Purple, and Cream was classified as acid rock. Other acid rock groups such as <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer,</b> Iron Butterfly, and Vanilla Fudge served as examples of early heavy metal, or proto-metal, creating stripped-downed, loud, intense, and [...] "fuzzy" [...] acid rock or hard rock. Bands such as <b>Blue</b> <b>Cheer,</b> Cream, and the hard rock group The Amboy Dukes have all been described as [...] "leading practitioners" [...] of the harder variant of psychedelic rock known as [...] "acid rock". Many acid rock bands would subsequently become heavy metal bands.|$|E

5000|$|Acrimony was a British {{heavy metal}} band who were active during the 1990s.
