5|$|A {{number of}} foods and {{substances}} {{have been found}} to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding nicotine, caffeine (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain relievers), and other stimulants in the hours <b>before</b> bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. Smoking tobacco products <b>before</b> bed is also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just <b>before</b> bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack <b>before</b> bedtime. Lastly, limiting intake of liquids <b>before</b> bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations.|$|E
5|$|A {{period of}} {{rudimentary}} training followed, firstly at Hopuhopu Military Camp {{and then at}} Papakura, <b>before</b> {{it was confirmed that}} the battalion was on active service. It departed New Zealand on the Orient liner RMS Orion for the Middle East on 5 January 1940 as part of the 4th Infantry Brigade, 2nd Division New Zealand Division. <b>Before</b> it left, it paraded <b>before</b> the public at the Auckland Domain and was addressed by the commander of the Northern Military District, Lieutenant Colonel Norman Weir.|$|E
5|$|A {{very fast}} Schumacher {{took the lead}} on track on lap 12 when Berger ran wide, <b>before</b> relinquishing the race lead overall to Berger {{when he made his}} first pitstop, {{confirming}} that his pace both <b>before</b> and after the red flag was down to him running a three-stop strategy, therefore racing with a lighter car. Berger pitted at the end of lap 15 for his first of two scheduled stops, <b>before</b> retiring a lap later with handling problems. Häkkinen led his first ever laps of a Formula One World Championship race, <b>before</b> pitting at the end of lap 18. Following the first series of pit stops, Schumacher resumed the race lead.|$|E
5|$|After {{splitting}} from I-295, US 130 continues northeast as a four-lane {{divided road}} called Crown Point Avenue. The route passes past an oil refinery <b>before</b> forming {{the border between}} West Deptford Township {{to the north and}} Westville to the south, where it begins to pass residences along {{the south side of the}} road. The road fully enters Westville <b>before</b> encountering the northern terminus of Route 45 at a Y-intersection. Past this intersection, the lanes of US 130 split briefly <b>before</b> rejoining.|$|E

5|$|All of the aircrew {{involved}} in the crash had only limited flying time in the months <b>before</b> the crash. The B-52's aircrew were apparently unaware that the aircraft had stalled until shortly <b>before</b> impact, indicated by a failure to apply standard recovery techniques to the aircraft once it entered the stall. The investigation reported that, even if the proper stall recovery techniques had been applied, the aircraft was likely too low to recover <b>before</b> hitting the ground.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{surviving}} ships except Condorcet were reduced to second-line roles by 1920. Mirabeau was not repaired after her salvage and was hulked {{for a few years}} <b>before</b> being sold. Vergniaud was in bad shape and became a target ship <b>before</b> she was sold for scrap. Voltaire and Diderot had their underwater protection modernized in the early 1920s and became training ships <b>before</b> they were condemned in the mid-1930s. Condorcet was assigned to the Channel Division in the early 1920s <b>before</b> she too had her underwater protection modernized. She also became a training ship after its completion, but she was hulked in 1931 and became a depot ship for the torpedo school. The ship was captured intact when the Germans occupied Toulon in November 1942 and was used by them as a barracks ship. Condorcet was scuttled by the Germans in August 1944 and refloated the following year <b>before</b> being scrapped.|$|E

The route intersects CR 600 and CR 620 <b>before</b> meeting Route 70 at an interchange that was formerly the Marlton Circle.|$|E
5|$|Bautista grew up {{receiving}} {{instruction on}} pitching from his second cousin, Pedro Martínez. The Florida Marlins signed him in 2000 but traded {{him to the}} Baltimore Orioles <b>before</b> Bautista reached the major leagues. He debuted with the Orioles in 2004, appearing in two games <b>before</b> getting traded to the Kansas City Royals. Bautista was ranked Kansas City's number two prospect by Baseball America entering the 2005 season, but he made just seven starts <b>before</b> missing {{the rest of the}} season with an injury. He posted a 5.66 earned run average (ERA) for the Royals in 2006 <b>before</b> getting traded to the Colorado Rockies. He appeared in nine games (all in relief) for the Rockies in 2007, spending most of the year in the minor leagues.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> each flight, a {{briefing}} was held, alerting the crewmembers to basic world events {{as well as}} safety criteria. At least 15 hours <b>before</b> takeoff, the crew would thoroughly pre-flight their aircraft. Inadvertently, this also increased efficiency in terms of maintenance and other pre-flight routines.|$|E

Allison finished the 1978 season with the Argonauts, playing in five more games, <b>before</b> being cut in June 1979.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> the 1998 {{release of}} Tony Fletcher's Dear Boy: The Life of Keith Moon, Moon's {{date of birth}} was presumed to be 23 August 1947. This {{erroneous}} date appeared in several otherwise-reliable sources, including the Townshend-authorised biography <b>Before</b> I Get Old: The Story of The Who. The incorrect date had been supplied by Moon in interviews <b>before</b> it was corrected by Fletcher to 1946.|$|E

5|$|<b>Before</b> {{the last}} Test, Miller played for Victoria against England {{in his final}} match for his native state <b>before</b> moving to New South Wales. He scored six <b>before</b> being stumped from the medium pace of Bedser and took 4/63 in the first innings, his best bowling since the First Test, as England scored 355 <b>before</b> Victoria replied with 327. His victims {{included}} Gibb, Yardley and Compton for 93, thereby preventing the English batsman from scoring his fifth century in as many innings. The match ended in a draw when England were bowled out for 118 in their second innings; Miller bowled two overs in his final actions for Victoria, conceding two runs without taking a wicket.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> the murders, Kovář's family became {{worried about}} his mental state {{to the point that}} they {{contacted}} authorities in connection with his possession of gun license. Just four days <b>before</b> the murders, Kovář had received a police request to present a new health clearance under the threat of revoking his license. <b>Before</b> entering the Družba restaurant, Kovář visited at least two other venues. Those, however, had fewer customers, and Kovář left them immediately after entering.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{informed}} Rialto by {{mail that}} he had learned of the two complaints from the Postmaster, arranged for himself to be notified of any future complaints, and arranged to represent Rialto in a hearing <b>before</b> the Postmaster <b>before</b> any sanctions would issue. Burton continued to represent Rialto <b>before</b> the Postmaster, and draw his monthly salary, for five months. Burton's intervention was successful, and the Postmaster's investigation was ceased without the entry of a fraud order.|$|E

5|$|During December 12, Wasa {{passed through}} the French Polynesian Austral Islands and passed {{directly}} over Tubuai, <b>before</b> it degenerated into a tropical depression later that day. However, gale-force winds remained associated with the depression, <b>before</b> the system turned towards the east-northeast and entered into warmer waters near the Tuamotu Islands. During December 14, Wasa regenerated into a tropical depression and was renamed Arthur for various reasons. During that day the system gradually intensified <b>before</b> it reached its secondary peak intensity with sustained wind speeds of 95km/h (60mph). During December 15, the system maintained its peak intensity, as it moved through the uninhabited Acteon Group of islands, <b>before</b> during {{the next day it}} started to gradually weaken. Arthur degenerated into a shallow depression during December 17, <b>before</b> it was last noted during the next day as it dissipated {{to the north of the}} Pitcairn islands.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the {{division}} was mobilised for war in December 1941 and initially undertook defensive duties in Australia <b>before</b> being deployed to New Guinea in 1943 where they {{took part in}} the Salamaua–Lae campaign against the Japanese in 1943–44, <b>before</b> returning to Australia for rest and reorganisation. In late 1944 they were sent to Bougainville to take part in their final campaign of the war. There they undertook a series of advances across the island <b>before</b> the war came to an end in August 1945.|$|E
5|$|Eakins {{made several}} on-site oil {{sketches}} and photographic studies <b>before</b> painting The Swimming Hole. It is unknown whether the photographs were taken <b>before</b> the oil sketches were produced {{or vice versa}} (or, indeed, whether they were created on the same day).|$|E

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Kempelen, the Turk {{remained}} unexhibited until some time <b>before</b> 1804 when Kempelen's son decided {{to sell it to}} Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a Bavarian musician with an interest in various machines and devices. Mälzel, whose successes included patenting a form of metronome, had tried to purchase the Turk once <b>before,</b> <b>before</b> Kempelen's death. The original attempt had failed, owing to Kempelen's asking price of 20,000 francs; Kempelen's son sold the machine to Mälzel for half this sum.|$|E

5|$|Fork-marked lemurs are {{sensitive}} to light intensity, and emerge at twilight, calling numerous times and answering their neighbors' calls <b>before</b> going off to forage. Just <b>before</b> dawn, they also communicate again {{on their way to}} their sleep site. Cold temperatures can also cause individuals to retire to their sleeping site as early as two hours <b>before</b> dawn. Their eye shine creates a unique pattern among lemurs because they tend to bob their heads up and down and from side to side.|$|E

5|$|HMS Defender was a D-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. The ship was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet <b>before</b> she {{was transferred to the}} China Station in early 1935.

Defender was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet just <b>before</b> World War II began in September 1939. She briefly was assigned to West Africa for convoy escort duties in 1940 <b>before</b> returning to the Mediterranean. The ship participated in the Battles of Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan over the next year without damage. Defender assisted in the evacuations from Greece and Crete in April–May 1941, <b>before</b> she began running supply missions to Tobruk, Libya in June. The ship was badly damaged by a German bomber on one of those missions and had to be scuttled by her consort on 11 July 1941.|$|E
