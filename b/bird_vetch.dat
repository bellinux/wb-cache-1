5|$|The {{plants and}} animals which live on Solsbury Hill reflect the habitat {{provided}} by grassland overlying the limestone rock beneath. Specialist {{plants and animals}}, {{some of which are}} rare species, have adapted to the calcareous grassland. Most of the landscape is largely unaffected by agriculture as shown by the yellow meadow ant. Examples of plant species found include <b>bird's</b> foot trefoil, <b>vetches,</b> greater knapweed, harebells, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and scabious. It is {{one of a series of}} flower-rich habitats, which Avon Wildlife Trust are trying to link together. The plants attract a range of insects including: the six-spotted burnet moth, hummingbird hawk-moth and a number of butterflies including chalkhill blues. A small population of common buzzard (Buteo buteo) nest in the area. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), badger and red fox are also seen. The skylark also nests on the hill.|$|R

40|$|Polyploid {{variants}} of {{many species of}} plants are strikingly frequently found among alien plants on all continents. They also very often have a much larger distribution range of its occurrence, compared to diploid plants {{in the place of}} their origin. In many cases, the polyploid cytotype also has increased tolerance to various stress factors or a physiological and morphological characteristics that allow them to survive the conditions in which the diploid plants would have little chance to survive. All this suggests that polyploidy is likely to bring plants an evolutionary advantage over their diploid ancestors, and polyploids therefore can successfully colonize new territories. This thesis summarizes the findings about the possible consequences of polyploidy at different levels in relation to their effects on the properties supporting plant invasive ability. It presents also known hypotheses dealing with possibilities of why plants become invasive after introduction. This is followed by sections devoted to flow cytometry, an important modern method for determining genome size and ploidy level. In conclusion it briefly describes the model species <b>bird</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia cracca) and the results of measurements of the degree of ploidy of seeds of this plant from Alaska and Japan...|$|E

40|$|Leguminose {{plant species}} {{are able to}} acquire {{nitrogen}} (N) through the interaction with N fixing bacteria of the genus Rhizobium, offering a clear fitness advantage over plant competitors, particularly under N limiting conditions. In the last 50 years anthropogenic eutrophication has strongly increased available soil N through atmospheric deposition and fertilizer runoff. Because eutrophication shows spatial variation, geographical selection mosaics in Rhizobium – host interactions are expected to occur because selection on the traits mediating co-evolution varies. This results in spatial variation in co-evolutionary interactions (i. e. “The geographical mosaic of co-evolution” sensu Thompson (2005)). These co-evolutionairy interactions may have an ecological impact on the plant community, the ecosystem or even on higher trophic levels. This study will be conducted on the mutualistic association between the clonal leguminose Vicia cracca (<b>bird</b> <b>vetch)</b> and the N-fixing bacteria Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae. There will be close cooperation withthe Rhizobium experts from the Centre of Microbial and PlantGenetics at KULeuven. Our main objectives are to: characterizethe genotypic variation of V. cracca and Rhizobium across a gradient of eutrophication, test the local adaptation of the V. cracca – Rhizobium mutualism through a cross-infection experiment, investigate the degree in which specific Rhizobium populations impacts host genotype sorting, determine {{the impact of the}} Rhizobium strain composition on the plant community and test the effect of the V. cracca – Rhizobium mutualism on aphid genotype sorting. nrpages: 177 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|While {{boreal forest}} {{habitats}} {{have historically been}} relatively free from invasive plants, there have been recent increases in the diversity and range of invasive plants in Alaska. It is critical that we understand how disturbances influence invasibility in northern boreal forests, to avoid the economic damage other regions have experienced from invasive plants. Black spruce (Picea mariana) is the dominant forest type in interior Alaska, and wildfire is the dominant disturbance in these forests. Furthermore, disturbances {{in the form of}} management for fire suppression are common in forests close to urban areas. I surveyed recently burned, managed, and undisturbed black spruce forests for invasive plants to determine if fire and management facilitate invasive plant colonization. I also conducted an experimental seeding trial with three invasive plants common to Alaska (<b>bird</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia cracca), common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), and white sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis) in burned and mature black spruce forest to determine if fire facilitates invasive plant germination. To determine the effect of substrate type on invasive plant germination, I planted seeds on a variety of substrates in the burned forest. Results indicate that fire and fire suppression treatments promote invasive plant colonization, as invasive plants were observed in burned and managed areas, but not in mature stands. Analysis of environmental data taken at survey sites indicate that fire mediates invasibility through its effects on substrate quality. In burned stands, invasive plants are most likely to colonize areas of shallow post-fire organic depth. Results from the seeding trials were consistent with results from invasive plant surveys, with reduced germination in mature compared to burned forest, and no germination on the residual organic layer in the burned forest. The highest germination occurred on mineral soil in burned forest, indicating that severe fires that combust the organic layer are likely to increase invasibility. The {{results of this study suggest}} that invasive species control efforts should be prioritized to disturbed forests, particularly areas where the disturbance has exposed mineral soil...|$|E
40|$|This {{data set}} {{consists}} of a Rapid Biodiversity Sampling from a non-intrusive citizen science GRID (5 * 5 geo-referenced sampling + 5 random plots = 30 plots overall). It includes raw count data for 305 bird observations of 14 identified bird species, and plants from the 25 + 5 survey sampling plots (3 m radius), as well as insects from four trapping webs (3 m radius, 25 traps each, 3 repeats; mostly spiders were detected). The survey was done between 25 th of June and 27 th of June in 2013 at the White Mountains (north to the NorthForkBirch and Twelvemile Creeks - near the Steese Hgw 6) in Alaska USA (decimal degrees latitude 65. 39590, longitude - 145. 72890, geographic datum of WGS 84). Plots are located near the public road in the rolling hills, subartic tundra on some slope, and some are located. All plot locations were photographed (sky, ground and habitat shots) and for a visual assessment. All bird detections (visual and oral) carry a radial distance 360 degrees from the observer, and were collected according to DISTANCE Sampling point transect protocols. Respectively, a DISTANCE Sampling trapping web protocol, with a 3 m radius and allowing for detectability correction in abundance estimates, was applied for ground-living insects. Generally, these data do not cover high detailed taxonomic information (and usually just follow basic but accurate descriptions). Each plot was visited three times according to the PRESENCE software requirements to obtain occupancy estimates. All of these data can be data-mined using for instance freely available RandomForest, Distance Sampling and PRESENCE software packages. Comparable Biodiversity GRID data so far is available for over 11 other regions (e. g. Nicaragua, Central Alaska, Costa Rica, Papua New-Guinea, Northern & Interior Alaska, Northeastern China and Russian Far East). Data from the other study sites are also available online.
