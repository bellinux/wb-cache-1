5000|$|It is {{desirable}} to consider food production as a chain, with animals reared {{on the farm}} (pre-harvest) then going for primary processing (harvest), secondary processing and distribution followed by final preparation (all post-harvest).

50|$|Other {{than the}} few bulls needed for breeding, the vast {{majority}} of male cattle are slaughtered for meat before the age of three years, except where they are needed (castrated) as work oxen for haulage. Most of these <b>beef</b> <b>animals</b> are castrated as calves to reduce aggressive behavior and prevent unwanted mating, although some are reared as uncastrated bull beef. A bull is typically ready for slaughter one or two months sooner than a castrated male or a female, and produces proportionately more, leaner muscle.|$|E
50|$|Pigs, {{cattle and}} sheep are {{frequently}} earmarked with pliers that notch registered owner and/or age marks into the ear.

Dairy cows are sometimes identified with ratchet fastened plastic anklets fitted on the pastern for ready inspection during milking; however NLIS requirements apply to cattle - including both dairy and <b>beef</b> <b>animals.</b> More commonly coloured electrical tape is used as short term ankle identifiers for dairy animals to identify when one teat should not be milked for any reason.

5000|$|Oxtail soup is {{made with}} beef tails. The {{use of the word}} [...] "ox" [...] in this context is a legacy of nomenclature; no {{specialized}} stock of <b>beef</b> <b>animals</b> are used.

Different versions of oxtail soup exist: Korean, Chinese, a fried/barbecued oxtail combined with soup variation which is a popular dish in Indonesia where it is called as sop buntut. An ethnic dish of the American South which traces its lineage back to the pre-revolutionary war era, and a thick, rich, gravy-like soup popular in the United Kingdom since the 18th century.

50|$|At Pigeon bay, {{which was}} heavily timbered, {{with very little}} open ground, only cattle-grazing was possible. Here in 1844, Hay had 18 cows. By February 1844, they were grazing 50 cattle and 500 sheep. Within a few years all these {{settlers}} had much larger numbers of stock. Greenwood had about 1500 sheep {{towards the end of}} 1845 and Deans cattle had increased to 130 head. At this time, Rhodes imported 400 sheep. Thereafter the number of sheep increased rapidly. Sheep, however, appear to have been regarded as an investment for the future rather than a major source of immediate income. Cattle, on the other hand, not only provided prospect of a future trade in <b>beef</b> <b>animals,</b> but an immediate return from dairying. Deans, for example, built immediately at Riccarton a cowshed with ten double bails, {{and at the end of}} his first season sent a consignment of cheese to Wellington.|$|E
50|$|The {{school is}} {{equipped}} with a farm, walled garden, greenhouses and workshops including a foundry and forge. The farm includes a dairy herd, <b>beef</b> <b>animals,</b> sows, poultry and a flock of ewes with lambs.Brymore is a state boarding and day school for boys aged 11-17, nestled {{at the foot of the}} Quantock Hills, in the heart of Somerset. It is proud to offer one of the most unusual learning environments in the country, with a farm, an acre of walled garden, a foundry, forge and workshops, enabling them to offer a broad and challenging curriculum that ensures that all boys succeed to their potential, surpassing expectations and equipping them with life skills that will help them to achieve a bright and prosperous future.Academic success is achieved through small class sizes, a tailored approach, outstanding facilities, excellent pastoral and boarding care and an emphasis on traditional values. As a school, it prides itself on stretching and motivating every single boy to achieve his best. The school caters for both academic and vocational students, with 23% of students achieving A/A* in English last year, placing the school in the top 1% of the country for progress. Meanwhile, the holistic approach to the curriculum benefits boys across the ability range, leading them to go beyond their limits, which is why they are in the top 2% of schools in the country for student progress across all subjects. 88% of students achieved 5A*-Cs last year, many of whom would not have achieved such results elsewhere. Because it is small, it is able to focus on the individual.As a state boarding school the education is free. Boarding fees are minimal, yet proud to offer an outstanding boarding environment, which rivals much of the independent sector.Brymore teaches boys to value hard work and commitment - hence, the motto ‘Diligentia et Labore’. Boys are expected to carry out duties on the farm and in the gardens and all boys are encouraged to contribute to the sporting excellence of the school. Brymore offers more extra-curricular activities than anywhere, with everything from Blacksmithing to Beekeeping, Canoeing, Cycling and much, much more. Boys are not only active, but well cared for, as the boarding team works tirelessly to ensure that student welfare and happiness is at the heart of all they do.Brymore offers more than academic success. In an age where the only constant is change, it prides itself on the development of the student as a whole. This year, the school is expanding to take in Yr7s for the first time, extending the Brymore experience from three years to five. The school will continue to enter boys in Yr9, provided there are sufficient places available.|$|E
