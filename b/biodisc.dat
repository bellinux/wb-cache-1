40|$|In {{order to}} produce {{hydrogen}} at high yields and production rates, the biotechnological process needs to be further optimized and efficient bioreactors must be designed. A <b>biodisc</b> bioreactor has been design and investigated to produce biohydrogen from glucose by the Clostridium butyricum CWBI 1009 strain at a high yield and production rate. This reactor, working continuously, has an internal volume of 2. 3 l but a working volume (liquid phase) of 300 ml. Firstly, it enhances the hydrogen production rate (by about 3 times more than a completely stirred bioreactor) by partially fixing the bacteria on the porous support and thus increasing the cell concentration in the bioreactor (decoupling of HRT and SRT). Secondly, the rotating <b>biodisc</b> design enables efficient gas transfer (hydrogen and carbon dioxyde) from the liquid phase where it is produced by the bacteria to the headspace. Indeed, {{this is an important}} way to increase hydrogen production yields (by about 25 % compared to a completely stirred bioreactor) by allowing the bacteria to focus on the metabolites pathways that produce more hydrogen. Other reactors designs have shown such good results by increasing the interfacial surface. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Erythromycin and fluoroquinolones are {{considered}} the drugs of choice {{for the treatment of}} Campylobacter infections. However, recently the broad use of these drugs has {{led to the development of}} antimicrobial resistance. 1 We conducted a study as there are no published data addressing the anti-microbial susceptibility of campylobacters in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Laboratory for Sanitary and Clinical Microbiology of the Cantonal Centre for Public Health in Zenica serves a total population of 432200 : 194100 in an urban area and 238100 in a rural area. From May 1 to December 31 1998 stool speci-mens were received from 1883 consecutive outpatients with sporadic diarrhoea: 1174 children < 6 years of age, 252 elemen-tary school students, 155 high school students and 302 adults. The samples were cultured on modified Preston medium (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and incubated in a micro-aerophilic atmosphere at 42 °C for 48 h. Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were identified using standard microbiological methods. 2 Sixty-four isolates of C. jejuni and 24 of C. coli (one isolate from each patient) were tested by a disc diffusion method using Mueller–Hinton agar supple-mented with 5 % sheep blood and eight antimicrobials (Oxoid) : ciprofloxacin (5 µg), nalidixic acid (30 µg), erythro-mycin (15 µg), tetracycline (30 µg), ampicillin (10 µg), gentamicin (10 µg), nitrofurantoin (300 µg) using <b>bioDiscs</b> (bioMérieux, France) and azithromycin (15 µg; Becto...|$|R
40|$|Keywords: chromogen, methicillin, MRSA, {{resistance}} Introduction: Currently, both in staphylococci {{isolated from}} animals with different diseases, {{as well as}} in humans, the MRSA strains (Methicillin Resistant S. aureus) are monitored, as the methicillin resistance is associated with the resistance to other antibiotic groups. Methicillin resistance is encoded by mec staphylococcal chromosomal cassettes (SCCmec), which are islands of resistance. These strains can be identified by molecular biology tests and tests that reveal several phenotypic characteristics. The research was made in order to characterize and identify phenotypically the MRSA staphylococci strains isolated from animals. Materials and Methods: Researches were made on 240 coagulase positive and coagulase negative strains of staphylococci. Mannitol fermentation was tested on Champan medium, free coagulase was revealed on Baird-Parker medium and to identify S. aureus subsp. aureus was used the chromogenic medium Chromatic Staph. Methicillin-resistant strains were detected by disc diffusion method, using <b>biodiscs</b> with methicillin, oxacillin and cefoxitin. Also, to identify the MRSA strains, was used the chromogenic medium Chromatic MRSA. Results: The isolates were positive to mannitol and produced complete haemolysis or were unhaemolytic. A total of 44 strains produced free coagulase on Baird-Parker medium, considered coagulase positive strains, while 196 were coagulase negative strains. The isolates conducted differently to methicillin: 22, 08 % of strains were resistant, 51, 25 % of strains were susceptible and 26, 66 % had intermediate resistance, while the resistant strains to oxacillin were 42, 91 %. The increased frequency of methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci and, particularly, MRSA strains, determined using the cefoxitin disk diffusion test, which is more reliable than methicillin and oxacillin. On the MRSA chromogenic medium, the methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci formed colonies with pigment from mauve to orange mauve. Conclusion: The obtained results by disk diffusion test on resistance patterns to 3 beta-lactams, resistant to penicillinase, indicated a different frequency of the resistant strains to these antibiotics. Cefoxitin disk diffusion test revealed a frequency of 2, 51 % of resistant strains, that can be considered MRSA strains...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} produce fermentative {{biohydrogen}} at high yields and production rates, efficient bioreactors have to be designed. A new reactor called anaerobic <b>biodisc</b> reactor allowed the production of biohydrogen from glucose with the selected Clostridium sp. strain at high yields (2. 49 molH 2 ·molglucose- 1) and production rates (598 mlH 2 medium h- 1). The bacteria were fixed on a rotating support enabling efficient gas transfer from the liquid to the phase. It allowed the metabolism of the bacteria to produce more hydrogen. Moreover, an increase of the total pressure 0. 18 bar lowered the yields of 19. 5 % while a decrease of 0. 11 bar increased the yields of 7 %.

40|$|The {{chemical}} and {{biochemical oxygen demand}} values {{of a number of}} synthetic and wastewater samples were determined using fluorescence spectroscopy. Treated and untreated sewage samples were obtained from a local sewage treatment works while synthetic samples were analysed before, during, and after treatment via a rotating <b>biodisc</b> contactor. Fluorescence intensities were normalised using the water Raman signal as an internal standard and corrections applied {{to take into account the}} attenuation effects caused by the sample matrix. The fluorescence emission spectra (λexc[*]=[*] 280 [*]nm) of synthetic and sewage samples were very similar in that two main fluorescence bands centred around 350 [*]nm and 440 [*]nm were observed in all samples. Normalised fluorescence data, centred at 350 [*]nm, correlate well with corresponding BOD, COD and TOC values (R 2 values ranging between 0. 93 and 0. 98). Using BOD, COD and TOC data the fluorescence at 350 [*]nm and 440 [*]nm can be apportioned to biodegradable and non-biodegradable dissolved organic matter respectively. The findings of this research show that fluorescence data can be used to quantify oxygen demand values ({{chemical and}} biochemical) and total organic carbon values. Furthermore, the fluorescence spectral response can be apportioned to biodegradable (BOD) and non-biodegradable (COD[*]−[*]BOD) dissolved organic matter. The potential of using fluorescence spectroscopy as a possible tool for real-time monitoring of sewage wastes is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Performance of a {{rotating}} biological contactor (RBC) in treating municipal wastewater from primary sedimentation basin and anaerobically treated industrial effluent from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was investigated. The 280 -L six-stage RBC pilot was operated at different organic loading rates and <b>biodisc</b> speeds. The overall removal efficiencies of soluble BOD decreased with increasing organic loading rates. Disk rotational speed did not have significant effect on performance in the range studied. The results showed that satisfactory treatment of UASB effluent to meet regulatory requirement for agricultural purposes (effluent BOD of 100 mg L- 1) can be achieved with sufficient margin of safety at organic loading rate of up to 4. 9 ± 0. 4 g SBOD m- 2 d- 1 with SBOD removal efficiency of 59 ± 9 %. For municipal wastewater, {{it was possible to}} achieve SBOD effluent values of below 20 mg L- 1 all the time. Most of the organics were removed in the first three stages with minimal contribution from the remaining stages of the RBC reactor. There was a decrease in SBOD removal efficiency to 74 ± 3 % at OLR value of 17. 8 ± 2. 1 g SBOD m- 2 d- 1 and 66 ± 6 % at OLR value of 4. 7 ± 1. 9 g SBOD m- 2 d- 1 for UASB effluent and municipal wastewater, respectively. The results for elimination capacity (EC) values indicated a linear relationship with first-stage organic loading rates without any signs of limitation in the range of OLR values investigated i...|$|E
40|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} (CWs) {{originate from}} natural wetlands {{and are used}} for waste water treatment {{as an alternative to}} conventional treatment. This thesis was aimed at providing a literary summary of the types of house sewage water treatment plants and constructed wetlands used in the CR and abroad, of their hygienic aspects, functionality, treatment efficiency, expensiveness and the possibilities of their use in the conditions of the CR and their advantages and disadvantages. It also deals with a proposal of a suitable type of house CW for the conditions of the CR and a list of the necessary steps in construction of a house CW. Quite similar systems are being used for house sewage treatment in the Czech Republic and abroad { [...] } mostly septic tanks, ground mounds, constructed wetlands, active treatment plants and <b>biodiscs.</b> Alternative water treatment methods are generally not suitable for buildings having (now or in the future) the possibility of connection to municipal sewerage systems. They are on the other hand suitable for buildings not connected to sewerage systems or for seasonal objects, remote places and holiday houses with seasonal waste water production. A system with horizontal subsurface flow is mostly used as a CW in the Czech Republic. This CW type ensures sufficient removal of organic contamination and insoluble substances, but the efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus removal is relatively low. However it is fully sufficient in the instance of low PE numbers, as the loading rate is usually low and the concentration of contaminants in the output water meets the prescribed limits. Foreign researches show that hybrid systems combining horizontal flow with vertical flow and with recirculation are more suitable for improving efficiency of nitrogen removal. Systems with vertical flow and intermittent waste water dosage showing particularly good results in ammoniac removal are also suitable for nitrogen removal. Special materials with higher iron, aluminium or calcium content are most suitable as filling of a constructed wetland or as additional filters or for improvement of phosphorus removal from waste water as they are able to reach efficiency of up to 90 %. In my thesis I came to a conclusion that a CW with horizontal subsurface flow is the most suitable type of house constructed wetland treatment for the conditions in the CR, mainly because it is the most frequently used and thus best proven CW type with sufficient efficiency of treatment for the substances required by standards...|$|R
