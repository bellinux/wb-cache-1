This inflow is aided by wave and tidal processes, but the exact patterns of sediment transport within the estuary are complex and are not fully understood. There is only a very small sediment contribution from the River Camel itself: most of the river's sediment is deposited much higher up the estuary.|$|E

5|$|Risk is an {{essential}} element in the battle system. A Risk <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> placed below the HP and MP bar, representing the Risk Points the player has accumulated. Risk Points affect Ashley's concentration; the longer Ashley attacks a target, the more his Risk Point accumulates — lowering his accuracy and defenses. Chain and Defensive Abilities increase Risk faster than regular attacks, while Break Arts do not increase Risk at all. Enemy attacks and spells deal more damage if the player has high Risk. The advantage, however, is the higher chances for the player to score critical hits and restore higher HP.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy VI is menu-based, {{in which}} the player selects an action {{from a list of}} such options as Fight, Magic, and Item.

When a character's action <b>bar</b> <b>is</b> filled, the player may assign an action. In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability.
