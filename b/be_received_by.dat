5|$|Among his {{considerations}} as a curator, Nzewi {{cites the}} importance of art history and his curiosity in how artworks reveal collective social imagination through expression and interpretation. He has expressed interest in learning from the creative process as artists make intellectual decisions about their work on reflection of how it will <b>be</b> <b>received</b> <b>by</b> others and the market. He has published essays in multiple academic art journals, contributed to Grove Art Online, and co-edited a volume on independent African art initiatives.|$|E

He {{came up with the idea}} to include puzzles that are integrated within the story, and need to be solved in order for the player to make progress.|$|E
5|$|All ballots, {{absentee}} ballot envelopes, and voting machines were impounded under a court injunction sought by state Republicans. Under the court order, {{absentee ballot}}s were counted in central locations rather than individual precincts. Of the 10,000 absentee ballots {{sent out to}} voters, 6,000 were returned. Absentee ballots mailed within the United States had to <b>be</b> <b>received</b> <b>by</b> April 7 to be counted. The deadline for overseas (including military) ballots was extended to April 13 after the United States Department of Justice sued the state to ensure {{they would have a}} reasonable chance of being counted. Counting of the absentee ballots due by April 7 began on April 8 under a New York State Supreme Court ruling sought by Murphy's campaign.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{attacked}} at dawn {{under the}} cover of fog, but other than one small penetration by a German company in the early morning which was quickly resolved, partly due to the gallantry of Sergeant Stanley McDougall of the Australian 47th Battalion, the Germans failed to break through the Allied defences. McDougall was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the battle, the highest award that could <b>be</b> <b>received</b> <b>by</b> an Australian soldier for gallantry {{in the face of the}} enemy. By late afternoon, rain was setting in, making early renewal of the assault less likely. The Germans suffered about 550 casualties during the battle, with the Australians losing around 137 killed or wounded. In the following week, the Germans renewed attempts to advance in the sector, culminating in the Second Battle of Dernancourt on 5 April, in which the Germans were defeated in desperate fighting.|$|E

25|$|On November 1, 2012 Open Channel's {{trial of}} MUXCPH was {{replaced}} with the trial of a new DVB-T2 trial multiplex, MUXCPH-2.

25|$|A TV tuner card is a {{computer}} component that allows television signals to <b>be</b> <b>received</b> <b>by</b> {{a computer}}. Most TV tuners also function as video capture cards, allowing them to record television programs onto a hard disk. Several manufacturers build combined TV tuner plus capture cards for PCs. Many such cards offer hardware MPEG encoding to reduce the computing requirements. Some cards are designed for analog TV signals such as standard definition cable or off the air television, while others are designed for high definition digital TV.|$|E

25|$|Another {{technique}} is the real-time tracking and localization {{of one or}} more small implantable electric devices implanted inside or close to the tumor. There are various types of medical implantable devices that are used for this purpose. It can be a magnetic transponder which senses the magnetic field generated by several transmitting coils, and then transmits the measurements back to the positioning system to determine the location. The implantable device can also be a small wireless transmitter sending out an RF signal which then will <b>be</b> <b>received</b> <b>by</b> a sensor array and used for localization and real-time tracking of the tumor position.|$|E
25|$|Bids {{for a new}} {{control tower}} to be located near the {{southwest}} end of the old abandoned NE-SW runway at Eglin AFB were announced by Col. Walter W.

The site is ~2,000 feet N of the center line of the new runway and 2,000 feet W of the existing runway. The height of the observation deck from the ground will be 62 feet, two inches. It was anticipated that the new tower would be completed in late summer or early fall.|$|E
25|$|The {{new member}} is then {{installed}} {{at a meeting}} of the Académie. The new member must deliver a speech to the Académie, which includes a eulogy for the member being replaced. This is followed by a speech made by one of the members. Eight days thereafter, a public reception is held, during which the new member makes a speech thanking his or her colleagues for their election. Once, a member (Georges de Porto-Riche) was not accorded a reception because the eulogy he made of his predecessor was not considered satisfactory, and he refused to rewrite it. Georges Clemenceau refused to be received because he feared that he might <b>be</b> <b>received</b> <b>by</b> his enemy, Raymond Poincaré.|$|E
