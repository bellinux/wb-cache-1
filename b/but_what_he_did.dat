Chris works hard. He had a little spell where {{he was trying to}} get himself together.

[...] On May 14, with the Rangers trailing 21 in the ninth inning against the Seattle Mariners, he homered against Brandon Morrow to give the Rangers a 32 victory. After a 1-for-29 slump, Davis hit two home runs on May 26 in a 73 victory over the New York Yankees. He had four hits on June 25, the fourth a 12th-inning two-run home run against Esmerling Vásquez in a 98 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.|$|E

After the events took place, Mike Huckabee, a strong right to bear arms candidate said [...] "I love my son <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was irresponsible, but not intentional. The right to carry a firearm has to be balanced with an equal responsibility to not make foolish errors like forgetting about it being in one's briefcase. ...I make no excuses for him and would expect him to accept whatever penalties are given. It is the court's responsibility to properly consequence him for a foolish act but his family's responsibility to love him and temper our disappointment with our support." ...|$|E

Melody Sachs complained about Ross being nominated so soon after the controversy in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying: [...] "I am amazed that Ross should get rewarded with a mouth like his. Nobody is saying he hasn't got talent, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was so disgusting. Of course he is not worth the money, but he is good at his job. However, I don't think he should be rewarded so soon after what happened. It is like people are saying, 'Let's forget all about it and see what we can give him.' It is wrong and bad timing to give or even put up this guy for recognition when he has done such a terrible thing. It was unforgivable, really. I'm not angry, I just don't believe it." ...|$|E

2500|$|As Barcelona's {{manager for}} nearly a decade, he helped create one of the {{greatest}} dynasties {{in the history of the}} club and continental football, both in terms of trophies and playing style. When Cruyff took over as manager in 1988, Barcelona were in a situation of severe crisis and debt. In the space of just six years (1988–1994), Cruyff the manager, with his leadership and management skills, turned Barça from the domestic strugglers and perennial underachievers into a true powerhouse of La Liga and European club football in general. In the early 1990s, the rise of Cruyff's Barça also officially marked the end of Real Madrid's era of overwhelming dominance (1960s–1980s) in La Liga history. As Jonathan Wilson writes, “He [...] was a beautiful, brilliant and inspirational player and that alone would have placed him firmly in the pantheon, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> as a coach is unparalleled. When he took over Barcelona in 1988, they had won two league titles in 28 years. Crisis had followed crisis. In the 27 years since, they have won 13 league titles and five Champions Leagues... All with the football of Cruyff.” At Barcelona, he assembled the so-called Dream Team with brilliant graduates from La Masia as well as world-class foreign players. He used a mix of Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, José Mari Bakero and Txiki Begiristain while signing international players such as Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Romário and Hristo Stoichkov. Under Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994 and the club's first European Cup in particular. They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley, with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de España trophies. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager at that point. He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years.|$|E
