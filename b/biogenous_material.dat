5000|$|The {{contents}} of the ocean floor vary diversely in their origin, from eroded land materials carried into the ocean by rivers or wind flow, waste and decompositions of sea animals, and precipitation of chemicals within the sea water itself, including some from outer space. There are four basic types of sediment of the sea floor: 1.) [...] "Terrigenous" [...] describes the sediment derived from the materials eroded by rain, rivers, glaciers and that which is blown into the ocean by the wind, such as volcanic ash. 2.) <b>Biogenous</b> <b>material</b> is the sediment {{made up of the}} hard parts of sea animals that accumulate {{on the bottom of the}} ocean. 3.) Hydrogenous sediment is the dissolved material that precipitates in the ocean when oceanic conditions change, and 4.) cosmogenous sediment comes from extraterrestrial sources. These are the components that make up the seafloor under their genetic classifications.|$|E
40|$|More {{than two}} hundred aerobic {{continental}} margin, aerobic deep sea, dysaerobic, and anaerobic / euxinic sediments have been examined for their variations in different operationally defined iron fractions, each of which represents a different reactivity towards dissolved sulfide. Aerobic continental margin, deep sea, and dysaerobic sediments contain similar contents of highly reactive iron (dithionite-soluble iron plus pyrite iron), poorly reactive iron (iron soluble in HCl less that soluble in dithionite), and unreactive iron (total iron less that soluble in HCl). By contrast non-turbidite euxinic samples from the Black Sea, as well as euxinic samples from the Cariaco Basin and Framvaren are enriched in highly reactive iron. These sediments contain a small lithogenous fraction and a large biogenous, organic C-rich fraction, which decays by sulphate reduction in an iron-rich water column to form pyrite-rich sediment. Other anaerobic / euxinic samples from the Black Sea, Orca Basin, and Kau Bay contain lower concentrations of biogenous sediment and are not therefore enriched in highly reactive iron. Degrees of Pyritization (DOP) for all the aerobic, dysaerobic, and anaerobic/euxinix samples (except those low in <b>biogenous</b> <b>material)</b> are consistent with analogous ancient sediments and indicate that most pyrite formation occurs form the highly reactive iron fraction...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} that leads to an optical classification of natural waters {{in terms of the}} dissolved and suspended <b>biogenous</b> <b>material</b> present. As a first approximation, this classification has been made in terms of the total chlorophyll-like pigment concentration. A relationship between the spectral diffuse attenuation cocfficicnt for irradiance and the chlorophyll-like pigment concentration has been found with spectral irradiance data from diverse types of ocean waters. The specific spectral attenuation coefficient due to phytoplank-ton is shown to be consistent with laboratory measurements of the diffuse absorption coef-ficient of various lot cultures of phytoplankton. Smith and Baker (1978) introduced the term Go-optical state to represent a mea-sure of the total effect of biological ma-terial on the optical properties of natural waters. No generally accepted technique now exists for relating the biological con-stituents to the optical properties within the euphotic layer. WC here present a method for optically classifying natural waters, whose dissolved and suspended materials are primarily of biogenous ori-gin, in terms of the total chlorophyll-like pigment concentration in these waters. The spectral characteristics of ocean propertics can be represented by a few principal components. An alternative to multivariate analysis is needed that would allow each component to have some physically measurable biological significance. Smith and Baker (1978) con-sidered the total diff&e attenuation coef-ficient for irradiance, KT, without consid-eration for its spectral nature. We have now found that K,(h) can be written as a linear function of the chlorophyll-like pigment concentration in the water col-umn by using Beerâ€™s Law and taking into account nonlinear biological effects. Spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient for irrudiance Smith and Baker (1978) gave detailed reasons for choosing the total diffllse at...|$|E
50|$|Terrigenous {{sediment}} is {{the most}} abundant sediment found on the seafloor, followed by biogenous sediment. The sediment {{in areas of the}} ocean floor which is at least 30% <b>biogenous</b> <b>materials</b> is labeled as an ooze. There are two types of oozes: Calcareous oozes and Siliceous oozes. Plankton is the contributor of oozes. Calcareous oozes are predominantly composed of calcium shells found in phytoplankton such as coccolithophores and zooplankton like the foraminiferans. These calcareous oozes are never found deeper than about 4,000 to 5,000 meters because at further depths the calcium dissolves. Similarly, Siliceous oozes are dominated by the siliceous shells of phytoplankton like diatoms and zooplankton such as radiolarians. Depending on the productivity of these planktonic organisms, the shell material that collects when these organisms die may build up at a rate anywhere from 1mm to 1 cm every 1000 years.|$|R

On the windward side of Kauai, the annual rainfall ranges from 30 inches near the coast to over 460 inches at higher elevations; on the leeward side, annual rainfall is less than 20 inches. This-large varia tion in rainfall results in a climatic range from trop ic-humid to semi-arid.

A detail ed study of several reefs on the windward side of the island shows that each pair of fringing reefs, divided by a relatively deep inlet, constitute sep-arate cells for the circulation of water and distribution of sediments.

It is roughly circular in shape, with a di-ameter of about 25 nautical miles (Fig. 2). Th e island is volcanic and has a central plateau whose eastern rim exceeds 5, 000 'f t in elevation. This mile-high rim intercepts the trade winds, causing moderat e to extreme precipitation on the windward slope and producing a rain-shadow desert along portions of the leeward coast...|$|E
