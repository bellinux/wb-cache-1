40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} experimentally the bubble breakup in a microfluidic T-junction divergence using a high-speed digital camera and a micro-Particle Image Velocimetry (micro-PIV) system. The breakup and non-breakup of N- 2 bubbles in glycerol-water mixtures with several concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) as surfactant were studied with capillary number ranging from 0. 001 to 0. 1. The cross section of PMMA square microchannel is 400 mu m wide and 400 mu m deep. Four various flow patterns were observed at the T-junction by changing gas and liquid flow rates. The dynamics of three various types of symmetric breakup of bubbles were investigated. The symmetric breakup of <b>bubbles</b> <b>type</b> I is mainly controlled by the augmented pressure in liquid phase. The symmetric breakup of <b>bubbles</b> <b>type</b> II is controlled by both the increased pressure and viscous forces. In the symmetric breakup of <b>bubbles</b> <b>type</b> III, a scaling law for the minimum bubble neck and the remaining time during bubble breaking process were found. The transitions between breakup and non-breakup of bubbles were investigated, and a power-law relationship between bubble extension and capillary number was proposed to predict the transitions between adjacent regimes. Our experimental results reveal that the bubble breakup in a microfluidic T-junction divergence {{is similar to the}} droplet behaviours in such a device (Jullien et al., 2009; Leshansky and Pismen, 2009; Link et al., 2004) ...|$|R

40|$|Surface and bulk nanobubbles are {{two types}} of nanoscopic gaseous domain that have {{recently}} been discovered in interfacial physics.

However, the two <b>types</b> of <b>bubbles</b> also differ in many respects: surface nanobubble stability is most probably assisted by the nearby wall, which can repel the water (in the case of hydrophobicity), accept physisorbed gas molecules, and reduce the surface area through which outfluxing can occur; bulk nanobubbles, on the other hand, must stabilise themselves.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{influence}} of gas addition is investigated on both sonoluminescence (SL) and radical formation at 47 and 248 kHz. The frequencies chosen in this study generate two distinct <b>bubble</b> <b>types,</b> allowing to generalize the conclusions for other ultrasonic reactors. In this case, 47 kHz provides transient bubbles, while stable ones dominate at 248 kHz. For both <b>bubble</b> <b>types,</b> the hydroxyl radical and SL yield under gas addition followed the sequence: Ar > Air > N 2 >> CO 2. A comprehensive interpretation is given for these results, based {{on a combination of}} thermal gas properties, chemical reactions occurring within the cavitation bubble, and the amount of bubbles. Furthermore, in the cases where argon, air and nitrogen were bubbled, a reasonable correlation existed between the OH-radical yield and the SL signal, being most pronounced under stable cavitation at 248 kHz. Presuming that SL and OHâ¢ originate from different bubble populations, the results indicate that both populations respond similarly to a change in acoustic power and dissolved gas. Consequently, in the presence of non-volatile pollutants that do not quench SL, sonoluminescence can be used as an online tool to qualitatively monitor radical formation. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a strong}} {{economic}} and ecologic demand for crystallization platforms which are significantly more efficient, flexible, and allow an improved control over the crystallization process. In this way higher quality crystals can be achieved which are required for application in personalized medicine and controlled drug release systems. Ultrasound crystallization is a promising tool to achieve these high quality crystals because it improves the reproducibility of the crystallization process and allows to control the particle size and shape. The goal of this doctoral project was to investigate how ultrasound can be applied in an efficient way during crystallization processes. The advantages of ultrasound like faster nucleation, the formation of smaller particles and impact on particle shape were already presented in literature. A thorough investigation about the optimal ultrasound settings, particularly the frequency and cavitation <b>bubble</b> <b>type,</b> to enhance crystallization was, however, lacking. Mostly, off the shelf equipment was used, designed for other applications like cleaning or dispersion. In addition, most mechanisms behind the ultrasound effects are unknown.

The purpose of this experimental {{study was to determine}} flow-pressure relationship, flow thresholds between <b>bubble</b> <b>types,</b> and <b>bubble</b> frequency as a function of flow and back volume. Methods A flow-driven vocal tract simulator was used for recording the back pressure produced by resonance tubes with inner diameters of 8 and 9 [*]mm submerged at water depths of 0 – 7 [*]cm. Visual inspection of <b>bubble</b> <b>types</b> through video recording was also performed. Results The static back pressure was largely determined by the water depth. The narrower tube provided a slightly higher back pressure for a given flow and depth. The amplitude of the pressure oscillations increased with flow and depth. Depending on flow, the bubbles were emitted from the tube in three distinct types with increasing flow: one by one, pairwise, and in a chaotic manner. The bubble frequency was slightly higher for the narrower tube. An increase in back volume led to a decrease in bubble frequency.

Each of the sixteen SST- 1 TF magnets has been tested fully and successfully in a dedicated test stand in nineteen campaigns during June 10, 2010 and was concluded on Jan 24, 2011. These campaigns ensured that all the sixteen TF magnets could be charged to their nominal currents of 10000 A in either two-phase or supercritical cooling conditions with leak-tight inter-double pancake resistances being in the range of 150 pico ohms to 1200 pico ohms. The supercritical helium cooled thermal shields welded in the inner bore of the TF magnets have also performed as per the design specifications. Subsequently, the assemblies of the SST- 1 TF magnets and the Poloidal Field (PF) magnets in SST- 1 machine shell have begun. The SST- 1 TF magnets are being assembled in pairs (known as octants) together with a SST- 1 vacuum vessel module, sector of 80 K <b>bubble</b> <b>type</b> thermal shields and a pair of outer-inter-coil-structures.
