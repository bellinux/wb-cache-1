5|$|Protactinium(IV) forms a {{tetrahedral}} complex tetrakis(cyclopentadienyl)protactinium(IV) (or Pa(C5H5)4) {{with four}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting protactinium(IV) chloride with molten Be(C5H5)2.

Another organometallic complex is golden-yellow bis(π-cyclooctatetraene) protactinium, or protactinocene, Pa(C8H8)2, which is analogous in structure to uranocene.

5|$|Berkelium forms a {{trigonal}} (η5–C5H5)3Bk metallocene complex {{with three}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting berkelium(III) chloride with the molten beryllocene (Be(C5H5)2) at about 70 °C. It has an amber color and a density of 2.47 g/cm3. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250 °C, and sublimates without melting at about 350 °C. The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound (within a period of weeks). One cyclopentadienyl ring in (η5–C5H5)3Bk can <b>be</b> <b>substituted</b> by chlorine to yield 2.

5|$|Following Oppenheimer's {{reorganization}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory in July 1944, {{the work on the}} uranium gun-type weapon was concentrated in Francis Birch's O-1 (Gun) Group. The concept was pursued so that in case of a failure to develop an implosion bomb, at least the enriched uranium could be used. Henceforth the gun-type had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could <b>be</b> <b>substituted,</b> one short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay. The new design was called Little Boy.|$|E
5|$|If {{opportunity}} costs are constant, a straight-line (linear) PPF is produced. This case reflects {{a situation where}} resources are not specialised and can <b>be</b> <b>substituted</b> for each other with no added cost. Products requiring similar resources (bread and pastry, for instance) will have an almost straight PPF and so almost constant {{opportunity costs}}. More specifically, with constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if {{there was only one}} factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve. With varying returns to scale, however, it may not be entirely linear in either case.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon and the plutonium gun-type fission weapon, the uranium gun-type weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design.
