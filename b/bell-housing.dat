50|$|Earlier {{versions}} {{used the}} Hunter 1725 cc engine, but later kits were shipped with the Avenger's 1600 cc engine mated to the Arrow range 4-speed gearbox via a special <b>bell-housing.</b> Later, {{they were all}} equipped with a 5-speed gearbox. The engine was changed to a Multi Point Electronic Fuel Injection made by Sagem Company. The spark distributor was replaced with ECU Controlled Spark Coils. The differential was also upgraded to a more compatible version to Avenger Engine.|$|E
5000|$|The XJ-S was {{launched}} on 10 September 1975. The {{development of the}} car had begun in the late 1960s as project XJ27, with an initial shape set by Malcolm Sayer, but {{after his death in}} 1970 it was completed by the in-house Jaguar design team, headed by Doug Thorpe. Power came from the Jaguar V12 petrol engine with a choice of a manual or automatic transmission, but the manual was soon dropped as they were left over from V12 E Type production. V12 automobiles were unusual at the time; Italian luxury sports car makers Lamborghini and Ferrari produced such models. The specifications of the XJ-S compared well with both Italian cars; it was able to accelerate to 60 mi/h km/h in 7.6 seconds (automatic) and had a top speed of 143 mi/h km/h. The first series of XJ-S cars had a Borg-Warner Model 12 transmission with a cast-iron case and a bolt-on <b>bell-housing.</b> In 1977 GM Turbo-Hydramatic 400 transmissions were fitted. [...] The TH400 transmission was an all-aluminium alloy case with an integrated non-detachable <b>bell-housing.</b> The XJ-S was originally supplied with Dunlop SP Super E205/70VR tyres on 15 × 6K alloy wheels; British police upgraded their Jaguars to a higher-performing 205/70VR15 Michelin XWX [...]|$|E
50|$|Mild hybrids {{like the}} General Motors 2004-07 Parallel Hybrid Truck (PHT) and the Honda Eco-Assist hybrids are {{equipped}} with a three-phase electric motor mounted within the <b>bell-housing</b> between the engine and transmission, allowing the engine to be turned off whenever the truck is coasting, braking, or stopped, yet restart quickly to provide power. Accessories can continue to run on electrical power while the engine is off, and as in other hybrid designs, regenerative braking recaptures energy. The large electric motor spins up the engine to operating speeds before injecting fuel.|$|E

5000|$|There was {{originally}} a separate <b>bell-house</b> in the churchyard {{which was a}} low building surrounded by railings but in 1709 the medieval bells were replaced by six bells described as [...] "very deep in tone" [...] which were bought from Woodford in Cheshire and installed in the tower. These bells were recast by James Harrison of Barton-upon-Humber in 1816. In 1854 two additional treble bells were added when the tower was rebuilt. The ring was rehung in 1880 and the whole ring was recast in 1923 by Gillett & Johnston.|$|R
5000|$|The {{electric}} motor provides greater efficiency by replacing the starter and alternator {{with a single}} device which assists the powertrain. Mild hybrids do not require {{the same level of}} battery power and do not achieve the same levels of fuel economy improvement as compared to full hybrid models. One example is the 2005-07 Chevrolet Silverado, Parallel Hybrid Truck (PHT) a full-size pickup truck with a single 7 kW 3-phase {{electric motor}} mounted in the <b>bell-housing</b> between the engine and a conventional 4L60E transmission. Chevrolet was able to get a 10% improvement on the Silverado's city fuel efficiency by shutting down and restarting the engine on demand, and the reduction of parasitic accessory loads. However the PHT had no power assist features or all-electric [...] "electric vehicle" [...] (EV) capability, and very limited regenerative braking features.|$|E
5000|$|The AOD was {{redesigned}} {{with electronic}} controls in 1992, becoming the AODE. It was mainly {{intended for the}} new Modular V8 at first, {{but it was also}} adapted to the old AOD <b>bell-housing</b> for vehicles still powered by OHV engines. While the AOD, AODE and early 4R70W share some basic components like oil pans, gear sets (AODs and AODE can be retrofitted with 4R70W gear sets), most of the internals are not interchangeable because the 4R70W and AODE use electronic solenoids to shift instead of conventional hydraulics. The transmissions are not interchangeable either, as the AOD only uses a throttle valve cable for operation. The AODE and 4R70W's shift points are controlled by the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) also sometimes referred to as the Electronic Engine Control (EEC). Applications: ...|$|E
5000|$|In March 1973 {{a team of}} Matra {{engineers}} led by Georges Pinardaud {{completed the}} initial design for project M560, {{which was to be}} a more powerful Bagheera. A key part of the project was the creation of a unique [...] "U engine" [...] out of two existing Simca straight-4 engines. The blocks came from two different Simca applications and rotated in opposite directions but shared the same 1294 cc displacement. One block was from the 1100Ti and was adapted to transverse mounting while the other was from the Simca 1000 Rallye II in which it had been mounted longitudinally. The two blocks were joined at an 82° angle using a common cast-aluminum sump that also carried a common oil supply for the engine. At the non-drive end another aluminum casting assured the alignment of the blocks while at the drive end a steel adapter fit the ends of both crankshafts. A sprocket and Morse chain from each crankshaft were connected to a 0.9 in shaft running {{down the middle of the}} sump that transmitted power from the left-hand crank to the right. Each block retained its own crankshaft, distributor, and water pump. The clutch and <b>bell-housing</b> of the engine from the Rallye II engine provided the transaxle mounting while a flywheel was only mounted to the 1100Ti crankshaft. The resulting [...] 8-cylinder assembly was fitted with four Weber 36 DCNF carburetors and, with a 9.8:1 compression ratio, produced [...] @ 6200 rpm and 216 Nm @ 4000 rpm.|$|E
40|$|State-of-the-art lung {{support systems}} {{are limited to}} short time {{application}} {{because of a lack}} of long term hemocompatibility and protein absorption on the membrane surfaces. In a highly interdisciplinary project at RWTH Aachen University a biohybrid lung assist system with endothelialised gas exchange flat membranes is developed to improve long term compatibility of oxygenators. To increase the gas exchange performance of flat membranes hollows are imprinted in the membrane surfaces. This approach is based on the research of B. J. <b>Bell-house</b> et al. [1], who discovered this effect, now known as Bellhouse-effect, around 1960. In this paper a processes to manufacture membrane assemblies for oxygenation with imprinted hollows on the flat membrane surfaces is reviewed...|$|R
50|$|Major Hise was {{promoted}} to brigadier general in 1968. General Hise returned to combat operations for a fifth time as the Assistant Wing Commander of the First Marine Aircraft Wing, Da Nang Air Base. During this posting, General Hise directed close air support for Marine combat units in South Vietnam. General Hise’s final posting was as commanding general of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, near Irvine, California. As commanding general of MCAS, El Torro, General Hise designed and built a structure to hold a 17th-century Taoist Bell from Ho Chein, China. The ancient bell was brought in 1945 to the United States by the First Marine Air Wing; the bell and <b>bell-house</b> currently reside at the MCAS, Miramar. He retired from the USMC in 1971.|$|R
5000|$|The {{church was}} built in 1905 by the Russians in Qazvin. The chapel, like other churches, has a {{cruciform}} plan with the altar facing east. The entrance is surrounded by two walls adorned with crosses. There is a three-storey <b>bell-house</b> at the entrance that is bounded by a small dome. Hall includes a chapel and altar, and on both sides, are two rectangular areas. The altar is {{in the shape of}} a half circle covered over the dome. Regarding the exterior of the church, decorative columns can be seen.Its architectural planning is based upon an irregular polygon made out of red bricks. The first floor of the bell tower of the chapel gives great views of the surrounding field. The paved churchyard leads to many tombs, one of which belongs to a Russian pilot who was killed when his plane went down during the war. In front of the church is a memorial to a Russian road engineer. The church is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Cantor" [...] or [...] "Kantur" [...] church from the name of the area where it stands.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{area of the}} oak {{bell tower}} is ten by ten meters. Its height is 32 meters, {{including}} the top crescent supported by a steel rod, which complies with the customary 1:3 base:height ratio of Hungarian bell-towers. The carved planks reaching down from the gallery form a whispering gallery, which shows great artistic flair.The whole tower including all joints and nails is made of wood. The structure stands on nine pillars placed on a 16 section base grid of oak beams. The pillars that reach up to the gallery, the actual bell chamber, are divided into four sections by horizontal binding joists. The body of the tower is strengthened by a mass of strutting beams, diagonal and corner supports. The scarf-joints are executed traditionally, syphering with dovetail joints and mortised holes. Square headed wooden nails were used for securing the joints. A wooden staircase made up of three straight sections leads up to the gallery, interrupted by resting floors. The <b>bell-house</b> houses two bells hanging on separate bellfries. The steep square based roof tops in an octagonal cap. There are four dainty circular turrets on {{the four corners of}} the roof structure. The anemoscopes on the quadrilateral turrets show the years: 1778, 1841, 1889and 1928. These are dates of restoration.Belltowers of this kind were built throughout Eastern Hungary and Transylvania. Out of them all Nyírbátor's is the largest and most notable. The skirting of the roof and body are shingled.The contemporary bell bears reliefs of the four evangelists. According to the engraved script, it was cast by George Weird of Eperjes in 1640, and commissioned by Stephen and Peter Bethlen.|$|R
