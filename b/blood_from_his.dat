5|$|Internationally, Hitchcock {{was forced}} to make {{minor changes to the}} film, mostly to the shower scene. In Britain, the BBFC {{requested}} cuts to stabbing sounds and visible nude shots, and in New Zealand the shot of Norman washing <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> hands was objected to. In Singapore, though the shower scene was left untouched, the murder of Arbogast, and a shot of Norman's mother's corpse were removed.|$|E
5|$|Investigation {{into the}} assault began even before Udin's death. The police began their {{investigation}} on 13 August, but were hampered as {{the crime scene}} had been contaminated during the commotion after the assault. Under the command of Sergeant Major Edy Wuryanto, the police began by collecting Udin's notes and <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> family; the family had received several bags of blood from Bethesda and were planning to bury it with the body.|$|E
5|$|From the {{apartment}} {{he shares with}} his hypochondriac mother Winifred, Seymour fetches his odd-looking, potted plant, but Mushnick is unimpressed by its sickly, drooping look. However, when Fouch suggests that Audrey Jr.'s uniqueness might attract {{people from all over the}} world to see it, Mushnick gives Seymour one week to revive it. Seymour has already discovered that the usual kinds of plant food do not nourish his strange hybrid and that every night at sunset the plant's leaves open up. When Seymour accidentally pricks his finger on another thorny plant, Audrey Jr. opens wider, eventually causing Seymour to discover that the plant craves blood. After that, each night Seymour nurses his creation with <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> fingers. Although he feels increasingly listless, Audrey Jr. begins to grow and the shop's revenues increase due to the curious customers who are lured in to see the plant.|$|E

5|$|In 1799, after {{a seven-year}} journey, Nilkanth's travels as a yogi {{eventually}} concluded in Loj, {{a village in}} the Junagadh district of Gujarat. In Loj, Nilkanth Varni met Muktanand Swami, a senior disciple of Ramanand Swami. Muktanand Swami, who was twenty-two years older than Nilkanth, answered the five questions to Nilkanth's satisfaction. Nilkanth decided to stay {{for the opportunity to}} meet Ramanand Swami, whom he met a few months after his arrival in Gujarat. He later claimed in the Vachnamrut that during this period, he took up a severe penance to eliminate his mothers flesh and <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> body so that the sign of his physical attachment to family, was completely removed.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} self-decapitation and the severed head is {{recurring}} in Indian mythology. Legends from the Simhasana Dvatrimsika and the Kathasaritsagara speak {{of how the}} hero offers <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> throat as an offering to a goddess. Rajasthani folk tales and songs tell about of warrior-heroes (jhumjharji or bhomiya) who cuts off his head before the war or is decapitated in action, but battles on – without his head – slaying foes until he avenges his beheading and dies. The decapitated body and head motif {{is not unique to}} Hinduism and Buddhism and appears across the world, including the Cephalophore saints of Christianity and in Celtic culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} steel cage match could be won only by {{climbing}} {{over the top}} of the cage all the way to the floor to win the match. Pinfalls and submission did not count, neither opponent could be disqualified, and the door to the cage would be locked for the entire match. As the cage lowered, Mike Tenay introduced the match and then handed the microphone over to AAA announcer Arturo Rivera to give the introductions in Spanish. Konnan came to the ring with both the IWC World Heavyweight Championship and the UWA Double Power Cup Championship that he had won from Perro Aguayo, although neither was on the line in the match. Once the door was locked, the two wrestlers began to brawl, with Aguayo trying to use Konnan as a ladder to climb out of the cage on more than one occasion. After a few minutes of fighting, Konnan dropped Aguayo face-first on the wire mesh cage, causing Aguayo to bleed (either by sheer impact or Aguayo secretly cutting himself to sell the brutality of the match). Once Aguayo started to bleed, Konnan began to focus on attacking Aguayo's forehead, including rubbing Aguayo's face across the cage. Moments later, both wrestlers found themselves on the top rope, fighting each other as they held on to the cage until Aguayo knocked Konnan off the top rope. Moments later, Aguayo attempted a pinfall even though the rules stated a pinfall did not matter. As the match progressed, sweat began to mix with his blood, causing his face to turn red. As Aguayo tried to climb out of the ring, Konnan leapt up with a low blow to keep his opponent in the cage. At that point, the cameras showed Eddie Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend watching the show from backstage, then moments later leaving the backstage area. As Aguayo climbed the cage, Los Gringos came to ringside and threw a cup of liquid in Aguayo's face. He then passed a set of brass knuckles to Konnan to use in the match. While at ringside, Guerrero got into a fistfight with several fans who were upset over his actions, forcing the security guards to step in and stop the fight. Following the assist by Los Gringos Locos, Konnan continued to attack Aguayo, with Aguayo ending up with his face and chest covered in <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> head wound. At one point, Guerrero attacked the ringside referee, Pepe Casas, preventing him from stepping into the cage to check on Aguayo. When Konnan tried to escape, Los Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000, and Universo 2000) ran to ringside, attacking Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend at ringside. As Konnan straddled the cage, Cien Caras climbed up and knocked Konnan off the top and back inside the cage, allowing Aguayo to attack his opponent. Moments later, Aguayo dove off the top rope with a double stomp on Konnan and then climbed out of the cage to victory.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, British {{obstetrician}} Dr. James Blundell made efforts to treat hemorrhage by transfusion of human blood using a syringe. In 1818 following experiments with animals, he performed {{the first successful}} transfusion of human blood to treat postpartum hemorrhage. Blundell used the patient's husband as a donor, and extracted four ounces of <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> arm to transfuse into his wife. During the years 1825 and 1830, Blundell performed 10 transfusions, five of which were beneficial, and published his results. He also invented a number of instruments for the transfusion of blood. He made {{a substantial amount of}} money from this endeavour, roughly $2 million ($50 million real dollars).|$|E
25|$|Although meeting stiff resistance, Hardee {{drove the}} Union troops back three miles (5km) to the {{railroad}} and the Nashville Pike by 10 a.m., where Johnson {{was able to}} rally them. Rosecrans canceled Crittenden's attack on the Confederate right, which had begun with Brig. Gen. Horatio P. Van Cleve's division crossing the river at 7 a.m., and instead rushed reinforcements to his own right flank. He had been slow to recognize the threat, assuming incorrectly that McCook {{would be capable of}} turning back Hardee's assault.

25|$|In late December, Rosecrans {{began his}} march against Bragg's Army of Tennessee, encamped outside Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The Battle of Stones River was the bloodiest {{battle of the}} war in terms of {{percentages}} of casualties. Both Rosecrans and Bragg planned to attack the other's right flank, but Bragg moved first, early in the morning of December 31, driving the Union army back into a small defensive perimeter. As he realized the severity of the surprise attack, Rosecrans demonstrated the nervous hyperactivity for which he was known in battle. He personally rallied his men along the line, and gave direct orders to any brigades, regiments or companies he encountered. Disregarding his own safety, he rode back and forth at the very front of his line and sometimes between his men and the enemy. As Rosecrans raced across the battlefield directing units, seeming ubiquitous to his men, his uniform was covered with <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> friend and chief of staff, Col.

25|$|Legend {{holds that}} the Archangel Michael {{appeared}} atop the mausoleum, sheathing his sword {{as a sign of}} the end of the plague of 590, thus lending the castle its present name. A less charitable yet more apt elaboration of the legend, given the militant disposition of this archangel, was heard by the 15th-century traveler who saw an angel statue on the castle roof. He recounts that during a prolonged season of the plague, Pope Gregory I heard that the populace, even Christians, had begun revering a pagan idol at the church of Santa Agata in Suburra. A vision urged the pope to lead a procession to the church. Upon arriving, the idol miraculously fell apart with a clap of thunder. Returning to St Peter's by the Aelian Bridge, the pope had another vision of an angel atop the castle, wiping the <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> sword on his mantle, and then sheathing it. While the pope interpreted this as a sign that God was appeased, this did not prevent Gregory from destroying more sites of pagan worship in Rome.|$|E

[...] After three weeks, Trenchard had shown some improvement and was moved to Johannesburg where he made further progress.

One of their [...]30-caliber Winchester rifles was selected at random and loaded with a non-lethal wax bullet so that they would not know with certainty who fired the fatal shots. According to the Utah Department of Corrections, the squad used a countdown cadence beginning with five and simultaneously firing right before two. His dark blue jumpsuit made it difficult to see the <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> wounds. A medical examiner removed Gardner's hood to reveal his lifeless face. After verifying Gardner's lack of pulse at the neck and pupillary light reflex, the medical examiner pronounced him dead at 12:17am.

500|$|The Yankees won {{the first}} three games of the series, {{including}} a 19–8 rout in Game 3. No team {{in the history of}} baseball had ever won a best-of-seven series after being down three games to none. Entering {{the bottom of the ninth}} inning of Game 4 at Fenway Park, Yankees reliever Mariano Rivera was attempting to close out a 4–3 lead. But after issuing a leadoff walk to Kevin Millar, pinch-runner Dave Roberts stole second and came around to score on an RBI single by Bill Mueller. Boston won the game in the bottom of the 12th inning on a home run by David Ortiz. Game 5 featured another extra-inning Boston comeback, as the Red Sox tied the game in the 8th inning, and won it in the 14th on a single hit by Ortiz that drove in Damon from second to make it 4-3 Red Sox. In Game 6, Curt Schilling, who tore a tendon sheath in his right ankle during the American League Divisional Series against Anaheim, pitched seven innings of one-run ball. 4 innings in and the Yankees had still yet to get a hit off Schilling. Schilling's tendon was sutured to his ankle to relieve the discomfort and was given local anesthetic and painkillers for the game. During the game, his sock started to absorb the <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> freshly sutured ankle, dubbed [...] "the bloody sock". During the game a controversial call was called on Alex Rodriguez when he knocked the ball out of Arroyo's hand on his sprint to first. Boston won the contest, 4–2. They then completed their historic comeback with a blowout win in Game 7, by a score of 10–3. New York Yankees blowing the 3–0 lead has been considered the biggest collapse in the history of the rivalry.|$|E
