5|$|Auburn Tigers – The Yellow Jackets {{have played}} the Auburn University Tigers more than 90 times in {{football}}, and the series of football games <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>is</b> the second-oldest in the Southeast. Auburn Univ. or A.P.I. is by far Georgia Tech's second-most-often played opponent in football. The rivalry is also intense in basketball, baseball, etc.|$|E
5|$|The Japan Meteorological Agency uses 10-minute {{sustained}} winds, {{while the}} Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses one-minute sustained winds. The conversion factor <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>is</b> 1.14. JMA's peak intensity for Faxai was 100km/h (65mph) 10-minute sustained, or 120km/h (75mph) one-minute sustained. The JTWC's peak intensity for Faxai was 75km/h (45mph) one-minute sustained, or 65km/h (40mph) 10-minute sustained.|$|E
5|$|Combinatorial {{game theory}} {{provides}} alternative reals as well, with infinite Blue-Red Hackenbush as one particularly relevant example. In 1974, Elwyn Berlekamp described a correspondence between Hackenbush strings and binary expansions of real numbers, {{motivated by the}} idea of data compression. For example, the value of the Hackenbush string LRRLRLRL... is 0.0101012...=. However, the value of LRLLL... (corresponding to 0.111...2) is infinitesimally less than 1. The difference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>is</b> the surreal number , where ω is the first infinite ordinal; the relevant game is LRRRR... or 0.000...2. follows directly from Berlekamp's Rule.|$|E

5|$|Cubic {{boron nitride}} has a crystal {{structure}} analogous {{to that of}} diamond. Consistent with diamond being less stable than graphite, the cubic form is less stable than the hexagonal form, but the conversion rate <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>is</b> negligible at room temperature, {{as it is for}} diamond. The cubic form has the sphalerite crystal structure, {{the same as that of}} diamond, and is also called β-BN or c-BN.|$|E
5|$|Durio {{sensu lato}} has 30 {{recognised}} species. Durio sensu stricto comprises 24 of these species. The 6 species included in Durio s.l. are now {{considered by some}} to comprise their own genus, Boschia. Durio s.s. and Boschia have indistinguishable vegetative characteristics and many shared floral characteristics. The crucial difference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>is</b> that anther locules open by apical pores in Boschia and by longitudinal slits in Durio s.s. These two genera form a clade that is sister to another genus in the tribe Durioneae, Cullenia. These three genera together form a clade that is characterized by highly modified (mono- and polythecate, as opposed to bithecate) anthers.|$|E
5|$|The Japan Meteorological Agency uses 10-minute {{sustained}} winds, {{while the}} Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses 1-minute sustained winds. The conversion factor <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>is</b> 1.14x. JMA's peak intensity for Conson was 150km/h (90mph) 10-minute sustained, or 160km/h (105mph) 1-minute sustained. The JTWC's peak intensity for Conson was 185km/h (115mph) 1-minute sustained, or 155km/h (100mph) 10-minute sustained. The National Meteorological Center of China estimated a peak intensity of 150km/h (90mph) 10-minute sustained, or 160km/h (105mph) 1-minute sustained. The Hong Kong Observatory assessed Conson {{to be slightly}} weaker than other agencies, with peak winds estimated at 130km/h (80mph) 10-minute sustained, or 150km/h (90mph) 1-minute sustained.|$|E

5|$|The Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji uses 10-minute {{sustained}} winds for its {{tropical cyclone}} tracking information, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses 1-minute sustained winds. The conversion factor <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>is</b> 1.14. RSMC Nadi's peak intensity for Nancy was 175km/h (110mph) 10-minute sustained, or 205km/h (125mph) 1-minute sustained. The JTWC's peak intensity for Nancy was 230km/h (145mph) 1-minute sustained, or 205km/h (125mph) 10-minute sustained.|$|E
5|$|The caracal {{is often}} {{confused}} with the lynx, as both cats have tufted ears. However, a notable point of difference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>is</b> that the lynx is spotted and blotched, while the caracal shows no such markings on the coat. The African golden cat has a similar build as the caracal's, but is darker and lacks the ear tufts. The sympatric serval can be told apart from the caracal by the former's lack of ear tufts, white spots behind the ears, spotted coat, longer legs, longer tail and smaller footprints.|$|E
5|$|The words protein, polypeptide, and peptide are {{a little}} {{ambiguous}} and can overlap in meaning. Protein is generally {{used to refer to}} the complete biological molecule in a stable conformation, whereas peptide is generally reserved for a short amino acid oligomers often lacking a stable three-dimensional structure. However, the boundary <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>is</b> not well defined and usually lies near 20–30 residues. Polypeptide can refer to any single linear chain of amino acids, usually regardless of length, but often implies an absence of a defined conformation.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{the city}} is home {{of two of the}} country's oldest {{professional}} football teams: Aston Villa F.C., which was founded in 1874 and plays at Villa Park; and Birmingham City F.C., which was founded in 1875 and plays at St Andrew's. Rivalry between the clubs is fierce and the fixture <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>is</b> called the Second City derby. Aston Villa are 7-time First Division champions and the 1982 European Champions, but currently play in the Championship following their relegation from the Premier League in the 2015–16 season. Birmingham City also currently play in the Championship.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, as {{a result}} of the {{continuing}} development in the relationship between the university and the nearby Roehampton Institute, it was decided to form an academic federation. In November 1999, the Privy Council approved the necessary changes to the university's Charter and Statutes and the Roehampton Institute became The University of Surrey Roehampton at the beginning of 2000. Between 2000 and 2004, the university and Roehampton worked together as the Federal University of Surrey. In June 2004, the Privy Council granted Roehampton an independent university title, and it became Roehampton University from 1 August 2004. This move ended the federal partnership between the two institutions, although collaboration <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>is</b> being maintained.|$|E
5|$|Journey is an indie {{video game}} {{developed}} by thatgamecompany {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3. It was released on March 13, 2012, via the PlayStation Network. In Journey, the player controls a robed figure in a vast desert, traveling towards a mountain in the distance. Other players on the same journey can be discovered, and two players can meet and assist each other, but they cannot communicate via speech or text and cannot see each other's names until after the game's credits. The only form of communication <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>is</b> a musical chime. This chime also transforms dull, stiff pieces of cloth found throughout the levels into vibrant red, affecting the game world and allowing the player to progress through the levels. The robed figure wears a trailing scarf, which when charged by approaching floating pieces of cloth, briefly allows the player to float through the air. The developers sought to evoke in the player a sense of smallness and wonder, and to forge an emotional connection {{between them and the}} anonymous players they meet along the way. The music, composed by Austin Wintory, dynamically responds to the player's actions, building a single theme to represent the game's emotional arc throughout the story.|$|E

5|$|Kitsune are {{associated}} with Inari, the Shinto deity of rice. This association has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. Originally, kitsune were Inari's messengers, but the line <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>is</b> now blurred so that Inari Ōkami may be depicted as a fox. Likewise, entire shrines are dedicated to kitsune, where devotees can leave offerings. Fox spirits {{are said to be}} particularly fond of a fried sliced tofu called aburage, which is accordingly found in the noodle-based dishes kitsune udon and kitsune soba. Similarly, Inari-zushi is a type of sushi named for Inari Ōkami that consists of rice-filled pouches of fried tofu. There is speculation among folklorists as to whether another Shinto fox deity existed in the past. Foxes have long been worshipped as kami.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{initially}} intended Ocarina of Time to {{be played}} in a first-person perspective to enable players {{to take in the}} vast terrain of Hyrule Field better, as well as to be able to focus more on developing enemies and environments. This concept was overridden once {{the idea of having a}} child Link was introduced, and Miyamoto believed it necessary for Link to be visible on screen. Ocarina of Time originally ran on the same engine as Super Mario 64, but was so heavily modified that designer Shigeru Miyamoto considers the final products entirely different engines. One major difference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>is</b> camera control; the player has a lot of control over the camera in Super Mario 64, but the camera in Ocarina of Time is largely controlled by the game's AI. Miyamoto says the camera controls for Ocarina of Time are intended to reflect a focus on the game's world, whereas those of Super Mario 64 are centered on the character of Mario.|$|E
5|$|Grand Forks has {{an active}} sister city program {{designed}} to encourage cultural and economic exchanges. Grand Forks' first sister city was Ishim in the Soviet Union. The relationship with the Siberian city formally began in 1984 during the Cold War. Sometime in the late 1990s, however, political and economic turmoil in Russia ended the relationship. While the relationship with Ishim faded, Grand Forks found a new sister in Awano, Japan. An informal relationship began in 1994 when the school districts of both cities began exchanging students. In 1998, the two formally proclaimed themselves sister cities. The most concrete evidence of the relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>is</b> a Japanese rock garden in Grand Forks' Sertoma Park and a sculpture of an American bison in an Awano park. However, the annexation of Awano by the larger city of Kanuma {{has led to the}} end of the sister city relationship. Grand Forks' relationship with Dickinson, North Dakota, began in 2002, when delegations from each city visited the other. Grand Forks Mayor Michael Brown has said he thinks having friends in western North Dakota, which typically has diverging interests from eastern cities, could help at the state legislature. Sarpsborg, Norway, became a sister city in 2005 following several exchanges among leaders from both cities. The city became interested in building a relationship with Sarpsborg because many Grand Forks residents have Norwegian heritage.|$|E
