[...] "I {{had quite}} {{made up my}} mind that we should always be {{dependent}} upon Moras; and be kept inactive, owing to his refusal to carry out anything Herrara might propose; <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> act independently of him, we are sure to have plenty of fun." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, my boys, I said 'Go' when I {{thought that}} there was a {{possibility}} of saving France. You have done your duty--more than your duty. It would be worse than folly--it would be wickedness--to voluntarily put your lives into danger, when success has ceased to be possible. I should be the last man to hinder you from what was your duty. I said 'Go' before, when few fathers would have said so. I would say 'Go' again, now, if your duty called you; <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> both obtain sick leave, for another six weeks, I say take that leave.

"Baseball is {{our core}} product -- it's perfect for {{baseball}} -- <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see tonight, soccer fits well", said Sean Flynn, {{senior vice president}} of marketing and events at Marlins Park. During the stadium's negotiations, the plans included a 20,000 to 25,000-seater soccer-specific stadium to be built directly adjacent to the baseball stadium for a possible Major League Soccer expansion team. The expansion bid fell through in 2008, and MLS has since moved away from building next to Marlins Park, with a preference for a downtown location.|$|E

50|$|The Centre, {{which is}} well {{used by a}} {{membership}} of 500 each year, has a voluntary workforce of over 30 adults who are supported by a small team of paid workers, has been hugely successful in attracting money for project work (including holiday programmes on offer to young people at little or no cost). The Royal Borough of Greenwich support the centre with an annual grant which helps towards the cost of two Youth Club sessions <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> imagine it costs considerably more money to keep both the building and playing fields in good order.|$|E
5000|$|According to a Belarusian news portal, Lukashenko himself {{stated that}} the [...] "last Presidential {{elections}} were rigged; I already told this to the Westerners. ... 93.5% voted for the President Lukashenko sic. They said it's not a European number. We made it 86. This really happened. And if is to start recounting the votes, I don't {{know what to do}} with them. Before the elections they told us that if we showed the European numbers, our elections would be accepted.

5000|$|... 'LANY' is {{an acronym}} for 'Los Angeles New York'. Klein {{addressed}} the name in an interview;"We knew we wanted a four-letter word because of design and aesthetic purposes, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> imagine, all the four-letter words {{in the entire world}} are taken. We moved to acronyms and for a while we thought we would be TTYL, but then we decided we didn’t want to be 13 {{for the rest of our}} lives. I eventually thought of the span across the country from L.A. to New York, and at first I was thinking it would be L-A-N-Y, but people kept getting confused on how to pronounce it when I told them, saying things like 'L-A-and-Y?' So then we’re like forget it—let's call ourselves LANY, pronounced Lay-Nee." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have seen}} Mr. Herbert Carter, and I am afraid I {{must tell you}} that Philip has not done so well as one could have wished.

5000|$|In a {{brochure}} for the 1960 exhibit, Sculpture Center's founder Dorothea Denslow commented,“These little {{people with their}} long noses, big eyes, and chubby figures live in a far-away land. They are friendly, warm and at peace with themselves, enjoying their unimportant happy moments. We do not know them or their country, <b>but</b> Renzi does, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> readily see by this show. Through his sculpture, we watch them as they work and play in close harmony, concerned only with the miracles of their simple world.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Some Nights {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 60, based on 21 reviews, which indicates [...] "mixed or average reviews". Rolling Stones Jody Rosen complimented the album's [...] "classic bubble-pop tunefulness with rococo rock & roll". Sputnikmusic staff reviewer Adam Knott wrote, [...] "The energy and personality which flood {{out of every}} melody give this album its own stamp of authority. It tips over into excess at rare moments, <b>but</b> even <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear those moments happening, they provoke grins inside and out." [...] Ray Rahman of Entertainment Weekly was less positive, criticizing the album's second half as being inferior to the first. Morgan Troper of PopMatters wrote that [...] "in a bizarre, inverted way, Some Nights is Nate Ruess coming into his own as a singer and songwriter," [...] but was critical of Ruess' use of pop music conventions in the album's songs.|$|R
5000|$|Coming {{into the}} tunnel I almost lost it, the back end just went down and I knew {{immediately}} I had picked up an instant puncture. The problem was I was halfway from the pits. So I had to drive so slowly {{to get to the}} pits. The car's brakes weren't working because I was only on three wheels. I think I lost 10-15 seconds just getting it back to the pits. We then had a longer pitstop than normal and as I came out of the pit I saw Ayrton go by, and I knew then that the race was probably lost, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see from the last 10 laps we gave it everything we could and more and his car was just too wide to get past.|$|E
5000|$|The correct use of procatalepsis {{is still}} an {{effective}} tactic in an argument, since it allows the rhetor to answer opponents before {{they have a chance}} to raise the counterargument themselves. This [...] "inoculation" [...] can be subtle, but also signaled rather obviously (e.g. [...] "Now, my opponent might argue that X. <b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see, Y"). The unique benefit to this more overt approach is twofold: The rhetor successfully replies to an opposing argument or audience objection, but also builds a sort of trust and authority with the audience. Then, if the opponent does in fact bring up the argument that the rhetor anticipated, the rhetor appears to be correct not only in the subject matter of the argument but in the general course of the argument itself.|$|E
5000|$|On 27 January 2016, Paul Thurrott {{summarized}} {{the operating system}} market, the day after Apple announced [...] "one billion devices": Apple's [...] "active installed base" [...] is now one billion devices[...].Granted, some of those Apple devices were probably sold into the market place years ago. But that 1 billion figure {{can and should be}} compared to the numbers Microsoft touts for Windows 10 (200 million, most recently) or Windows more generally (1.5 billion active users, a number that hasn’t moved, magically, in years), and that Google touts for Android (over 1.4 billion, as of September).My understanding of iOS is that the user base was previously thought to be around 800 million strong, and when you factor out Macs and other non-iOS Apple devices, that's probably about right. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see, there are three big personal computing platforms.

Prepare the color {{with three or four}} teaspoonfuls of water; then, when it is mixed, pour away about two-thirds of it, keeping a teaspoonful of pale color. Sloping your paper as before, draw two pencil lines all the way down, leaving a space between them of the width of a square on your chess-board. Begin {{at the top of your}} paper, between the lines; and having struck on the first brushful of color, and led it down a little, dip your brush deep in water, and mix up the color on the plate quickly with as much more water as the brush takes up at that one dip: then, with this paler color, lead the tint farther down. Dip in water again, mix the color again, and thus lead down the tint, always dipping in water once between each replenishing of the brush, and stirring the color on the plate well, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> quickly <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> Go on until the color has become so pale that you cannot see it; then wash your brush thoroughly in water, and carry the wave down a little farther with that, and then absorb it with the dry brush, and leave it to dry.|$|R
