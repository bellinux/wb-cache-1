[...] Director of exhibitions and collections at the Oceanside Museum of Art, Teri Sowell, reflected of the exhibition featuring Page's work to The San Diego Union-Tribune, [...] "These creatures are so embedded in our minds, we take them for granted. It's really handcrafted art." [...] Film director J. J. Abrams commented on Page's work on his film Super 8, [...] "the designer of the creature, Neville Page, did an amazing job and I think he gave us something that took a ton of iterations <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> nailed it".|$|E
500|$|Following the {{expiration}} {{of his contract}} on the Star Wars newspaper strip, Williamson found that the weight of doing both pencil and inks suddenly became stressful to him, drastically reducing his output. As a response to this, in the mid-1980s Williamson made a successful transition to becoming strictly an inker, beginning at DC Comics inking Curt Swan on Superman #408–410 and #412–416. The longtime Man of Steel artist would later describe Williamson as [...] "his favorite inker". Williamson then moved to Marvel where he inked such pencillers such as John Buscema, Gene Colan, Rick Leonardi, Mike Mignola, Pat Oliffe, John Romita Jr., Lee Weeks, and many others. John Romita Sr., Marvel's art director during that time, considered Williamson to be [...] "one of the best pencillers in the world <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> can't make a living at penciling {{because he wants to}} do these beautifully pencilled pages with ample time to do them. That's why Al is inking now ... and adding a greater dimension to the penciller he's working with." [...] He won nine industry awards for Best Inker between 1988 and 1997.|$|E

500|$|The cliffhanger, {{in which}} Rousseau and Karl are killed and Alex calls out in desperation {{that she is}} Ben's daughter, gained a mixed response. In an 8.8 out of 10 review, IGN's Chris Carabott called the scene [...] "completely out of place … tacked on and anticlimactic" [...] as it [...] "came at the strangest moment". Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post deemed the cliffhanger [...] "a shocker"; he asked [...] "do we really care ? I mean, {{he did have a}} nice new haircut and all, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> wasn't too {{interesting}} of a character." [...] Despite his assessment that [...] "this impressive episode was a fitting midseason finale", Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones wrote that the [...] "climax wasn't as effective as one could have hoped for, as the collective fates of Alex, Danielle and the ultra-expendable Karl don't rouse a great deal of interest." [...] Grading the episode as a [...] "B", Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen was also unimpressed with the cliffhanger and the characters carrying it; he felt that network executives were partially to blame for going against the wish of the show's creative team to broadcast [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] as a midseason premiere as opposed to a midseason finale. Jensen criticized the episode's unique flashback format, commenting that it lacked the usual [...] "deeper, more immersive experience [...] embellishes the sophistication of the storytelling" [...] of Lost.|$|E
500|$|The writing staff cited The Wizard of Oz as {{a source}} of {{thematic}} influence for Tron: Legacy in writing the script, with Kitsis stating that [...] "They both have very similar DNA, which is Tron really lives on, in a lot of ways, trying to get home. You're put on this world and you want to go home and what is home? That's in a lot of way inspired us." [...] Kitsis also added that they had to include an"emotional spine to take us into the story or else it just becomes a bunch of moves or gags and stuff", eventually deciding on adding a mysterious destiny to Flynn and giving him a legendary aura - [...] "Kevin Flynn to us was Steve Jobs and Bill Gates all wrapped up into one and John Lennon". The writers decided to create the character of Clu as an evil embodiment of [...] "how you look back on your younger self, (...) that guy [...] thought he knew everything, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> knew nothing". Bridges liked the idea of the dual perspectives, and contributed with the writers for the characterization of Flynn as a sanguine Zen master by suggesting them to get inspiration from various Buddhist texts. Part of the concepts emerged from a reunion the producers had with scientists from California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to discuss concepts such as isomorphic algorithms and the digitizing of organic matter.|$|E

[...] Torvalds' supposed illness is a joke, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> was bitten by a little penguin {{on a visit to}} the National Zoo & Aquarium, Canberra, Australia. Torvalds was looking for something fun and sympathetic to associate with Linux, and a slightly fat penguin sitting down after having had a great meal perfectly fit the bill.|$|E
2500|$|A Mining Gazette {{reporter}} termed Moyer's speech {{a refreshing}} {{change from the}} [...] "radical [...] [...] [...] viciously inflammatory" [...] oratory of Miller and Mahoney.

Moyer was long-winded and not an effective orator, he continued, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> made [...] "a nice little argument from the WFM point of view." [...] Moyer said that he favored having the militia in the district but that [...] "the governor should order them to disarm all these thugs and gunmen, load them on trains and dump them without the confines of the state." [...] The reporter commented that [...] "in this statement Moyer has the approval of a great many {{people on both sides of}} the strike question." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mark Gatiss {{said that}} Capaldi's Doctor was [...] "sort of Tom Baker, Jon Pertwee and even Christopher Eccleston style...it's someone who's not {{immediately}} {{going to be}} your best friend and can be quite abrupt and rude." [...] Moffat added to this analysis of the character by saying, [...] "He has a tremendous ability with throwaway humour {{and a lot of it}} is around the fact that sometimes he is terribly rude. I think kids will think he is the rude Doctor [...] You might want to cuddle him <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> will resist." [...] It has been said that part of the Doctor's personality will share [...] "a certain acid wit" [...] of Malcolm Tucker, the role Peter Capaldi is most famous for, [...] "specifically the attitude, the wisecracks and the energy...he can be edgy, volatile and dangerous". Capaldi has stated that all of the previous actors who had played the Doctor were channelled in his portrayal and that his particular influences were Hartnell, Pertwee and Davison.|$|E
2500|$|Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly {{noticed a}} {{connection}} between Daniel and Imogen in their first scenes together and Phillipps told him that something could happen between them in the future.

He doesn't get why she finds stuff so frustrating, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> loves that about her as well." [...] Daniel and Imogen clashed again when she dropped her birthday dress after he ran into her on his skateboard. Daniel bought her a new dress, {{but it was too}} big for Imogen and she refused to accept it. Later that day, Imogen accidentally crushed Daniel's skateboard during a driving lesson, but Daniel believed it was her way of getting revenge for the dress. Imogen developed feelings for Daniel after they teamed up for a community project. Phillipps commented that Daniel and Imogen had developed [...] "a great chummy friendship", so he thought Daniel would {{be surprised to learn that}} Imogen has feelings for him.|$|E
2500|$|Elliot is {{described}} on the BBC Online Holby City homepage as [...] "a disorganised genius" [...] who [...] "comes across as a bumbling eccentric" [...] but has surgical expertise which is [...] "second to none". Bradley has deemed Elliot [...] "a medical Columbo", who is [...] "shambling, untidy but good with patients and a genius medically", as well as [...] "a brilliant surgeon who does everything in an off-the-wall way." [...] He {{has been described as}} [...] "genial" [...] by The Mirror Shelley, while fellow Mirror critic Jane Simon has deemed him [...] "shambling" [...] and [...] "not the most convincing medic we've ever seen". Comparing Elliot to fellow cardiothoracic consultant Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing), Bradley explained: [...] "Connie is text book brilliant, whereas Elliot is more inspired. He may seem eccentric <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> listens to his patients - he's very straight forward and not at all stuck up. They are chalk and cheese. Connie's side of the office is very neat and tidy. But Elliot's is a total mess. She's quite uptight, and anybody as relaxed as Elliot really gets on her nerves." [...] On 17 November 2006, Bradley appeared as Elliot in a Children in Need segment featuring the Holby City cast performing a version of [...] "Hung Up" [...] by Madonna.|$|E

During the whole tour, producer Flying Lotus played Lamar a selection of tracks that was intended for Captain Murphy's album (Flying Lotus's alter ego). Lamar kept all the tracks, but only opener [...] "Wesley's Theory", which also features Thundercat and George Clinton, made the final cut onto the album. Lotus had produced a version of [...] "For Sale? (Interlude)" [...] that was ultimately discarded, with Lamar using Taz Arnold's version of the song on the album instead. Lotus stated that it is unlikely his version of the song will see a release. American rapper Rapsody appeared on the album, contributing a verse to the song [...] "Complexion (A Zulu Love)". Lamar had requested that 9th Wonder contact Rapsody and request her appearance. Rapsody and Lamar discussed the song but there was little instruction from Lamar regarding her contribution. Speaking about the song, she stated that Lamar had already decided on the concept of the song and stated that the only instructions he gave were the song's title and the idea that [...] "...we are beautiful no matter our race <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> wanted to speak to our people and address this light versus dark complex".|$|E
