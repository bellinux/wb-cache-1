25|$|Lake {{and marine}} environments on Earth are {{favorable}} for fossil preservation, especially where the sediments {{they left behind}} are rich in carbonates or clays. Hundreds of highland craters on Mars have horizontally layered, sedimentary rocks that may have formed in lakes. CRISM has taken many targeted observations of these rocks to measure their mineralogy and how the minerals vary between layers. Variation between layers helps us to understand {{the sequence of events}} that formed the sedimentary rocks. The Mars Orbiter Camera found that where valley networks empty into craters, commonly the craters contain fan-shaped deposits. However it was not completely clear if the fans formed by sediment deposition on dry crater floors (alluvial fans) or in crater lakes (deltas). CRISM discovered that in the fans' lowermost layers, there are concentrated deposits of clay. More clay occurs beyond the end of the fans on the crater floors, and in some cases there is also opal. On Earth, the lowermost layers of deltas are called <b>bottom</b> <b>set</b> <b>beds,</b> and they are made of clays that settled out of inflowing river water in quiet, deep parts of the lakes. This discovery supports the idea that many fans formed in crater lakes where, potentially, evidence for habitable environments could be preserved.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the concept of}} the disjunctive <b>bottom</b> <b>set</b> and discusses its computation. The disjunctive <b>bottom</b> <b>set</b> differs from existing extensions of the <b>bottom</b> <b>set,</b> such as kernel sets(Ray, Broda, & Russo 2003), by being the weak-est minimal single hypothesis for the whole hypothesis space. The disjunctive <b>bottom</b> <b>set</b> may be characterized in terms of minimal models. Therefore, as minimal models can be com-puted in polynomial space complexity, so can the disjunctive <b>bottom</b> <b>set.</b> We outline a flexible inductive logic program-ming framework based on the disjunctive <b>bottom</b> <b>set.</b> Com-pared with existing systems based on <b>bottom</b> <b>set,</b> such as Pro-gol (Muggleton 1995), it can probe an enlarged hypothesis space without increasing space complexity. Another novelty of the framework is that it provides an avenue, via hypoth-esis selection function, for the integration of more advanced hypothesis selection mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{implementations}} of the Extended Transformation Approach (ETA) to first-order feature construction use powerful pruning mechanisms often enabling a {{very efficient}} search for features. This motivates a theoretical challenge to define families of feature languages which provably allow for efficient finding of their elements. The main {{result of this}} paper is that if a <b>bottom</b> <b>set</b> can be constructed of size polynomial in the preset maximum feature size n, containing literals of all features that comply to typing/moding declarations, then a correct feature can be found (or decided that no such feature exists) in time polynomial in n. This result is a consequence of the ‘variable production- consumption’ axiom previously established in the ETA on intuitive grounds, and thus provides a theoretical justification thereof. Preliminary results are included on conditions on which a) a polynomial <b>bottom</b> <b>set</b> can/cannot be constructed, b) all features can be efficiently enumerated...|$|R

40|$|Sixty-two {{verified}} reports {{obtained in}} the years 1990 - 1999 on the bycatch, strandings and sightings of harbour porpoises in the Polish Baltic were analysed in this study. In relative terms the highest number of reports (22) was noted in Puck Bay. Forty-five (72. 6 %) reports referred to specimens from bycatch, 10 (16. 1 %) were individuals observed at sea, and 7 (11. 3 %) were stranded.  A large proportion (42. 2 %) of the bycatch occurred in the fishing grounds of Puck Bay. Forty carcasses of harbour porpoises were obtained for further analysis. Most of the bycatch took place from December to April with a maximum in March. In {{the rest of the}} year there were 1 to 3  bycaught animals reported per month with no cases of bycatch in June. Taking into account data on fishing effort collected for the study area it appears that by far the greatest threat to harbour porpoises is posed by nets used for salmonids. Among all the bycaught animals, most (40. 0 %)  perished in salmon semi-drift nets. A considerable number of the harbour porpoises perished in <b>bottom</b> <b>set</b> nets for cod (33. 3 %) while only a single bycatch event was reported from herring trawl nets. To assess the danger from different fishing gear and to determine the areas where the threats are the highest, direct observation of the fisheries was conducted. In the course of boat inspections various types of fishing gear were identified and geographical positions of 1, 069 nets were marked. The majority (92 %) consisted of semi-drift nets for sea trout and salmon. Relatively low rates of bycatch were reported from <b>bottom</b> <b>set</b> nets, which had a density over 20 times less than that of surface salmon nets in the area in the autumn months. The density and distribution of both types of nets in the surveyed area was comparable during autumn and winter, when the majority of bycaught animals in <b>bottom</b> <b>set</b> nets were reported...|$|R
