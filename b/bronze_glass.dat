25|$|Early {{architecture}} on {{the campus}} exhibits typical characteristics of Brutalism, a popular civic style when the structures were designed and built. In accordance with this style, many of the early buildings are pale, off-white, precast concrete with repetitive structures. Later architecture exhibits late modern or postmodern features such as <b>bronze</b> <b>glass,</b> bronze aluminum frames, unadorned geometric shapes, unusual surfaces, and unorthodox layouts. This later modern styling {{is seen in the}} Engineering and Computer Science building, School of Management, Cecil and Ida Green Center, and Natural Science and Engineering Research Lab facility (sometimes called the Mermaid Building due to its colorful anodized shingles). The Student Services building, completed in 2010, is the first academic structure in Texas to be rated a LEED Platinum facility by the United States Green Building Council. To provide protection from inclement weather and extreme temperatures, many of the buildings on campus are connected by a series of elevated indoor walking paths also referred to as skybridges.|$|E
2500|$|The Lusatian {{culture of}} the Hallstatt periods {{included}} most lands of present-day Poland, including the related Białowice culture (Zielona Góra County) {{in some of the}} westernmost parts, contemporaneous with Hallstatt C and D and later and credited with the passing of a [...] "cist" [...] (rock encasement) grave type to the Pomeranian culture. Western Poland was more highly developed, with local manufacturing; jewelry and other decorative products made of iron, <b>bronze,</b> <b>glass,</b> amber and other materials as well as luxurious painted ceramics were patterned after the Hallstatt craft. In many graveyards the dead were buried in wooden chambers. The burials found in Gorszewice (Szamotuły County) in Greater Poland (650–550 BC) are supplied with fancy equipment and resemble the graves of the Hallstatt tribal chiefs; similarly there are other treasures of luxurious and prestigious objects.|$|E

40|$|We report {{experimental}} studies {{of the effect of}} interstitial gas on mass-density-segregation in a vertically-vibrated mixture of equal-sized <b>bronze</b> and <b>glass</b> spheres. Sufficiently strong vibration in the presence of interstitial gas induces vertical segregation into sharply separated <b>bronze</b> and <b>glass</b> layers. We find that the segregated steady state (i. e., <b>bronze</b> or <b>glass</b> layer on top) is a sensitive function of gas pressure and viscosity, as well as vibration frequency and amplitude. In particular, we identify distinct regimes of behavior that characterize the change from bronze-on-top to glass-on-top steady-state.

50|$|His first {{works were}} in {{sandstone}} {{as well as}} in plaster and stucco. In the 1960s, he began to combine various materials (<b>bronze,</b> <b>glass)</b> and smoothing the surface extremely. Figurative and geometrical elements were also combined, so that the work as a whole appears to have an intensified stylization.|$|E
50|$|Van Munster’s work is minimalist. He {{has worked}} in wood, stone, <b>bronze,</b> <b>glass</b> and other materials, and has also {{produced}} light sculptures and video art.

His work ranged from traditional frescos to those made with vinyl, mosaics, stone, bronze and terracotta.|$|E
50|$|Constructed of Minnesota limestone, and {{designed}} by William Rawn Associates of Boston, the Church of the Transfiguration is a contemporary expression {{of an ancient}} 4th century basilica style of architecture, featuring a long rectangular nave, a rounded apse at the east end, narrow side aisles, a peaked timber roof, and interior columns and arches along the side aisles.

It was noted that these features, coupled with inclined fascia lines and extensive tapering <b>bronze</b> <b>glass</b> panels, have produced a structure that will remain modern and functional {{for many years to}} come.|$|E

50|$|For centuries {{the mounds}} were {{believed}} to cover the bodies of those killed at the Battle of Ashingdon in 1016, but excavation demonstrated {{that they are the}} graves of a wealthy family and date from the 1st or 2nd century AD. Excavations in the 19th century found large wooden chests, decorated vessels in <b>bronze,</b> <b>glass</b> and pottery and an iron folding chair, most of which were lost in a later fire at Bartlow Hall. A small Roman villa, occupied until the late 4th century, was situated north of the mounds and was excavated in 1852.|$|E

50|$|Excavations were {{undertaken}} in the 19th century (chiefly in 1832-40), discovering remains of large wooden chests, decorated vessels in <b>bronze,</b> <b>glass</b> and pottery and an iron folding chair (most of which were lost in a later fire at Easton Lodge in 1847). A small Roman villa, occupied until the late 4th century, was situated north of the mounds and was excavated in 1852. The site saw no further work until a geophysical survey in 2006 and further excavations in 2007. During this work, {{it was not possible}} to locate the Roman villa.|$|E
50|$|One Shell Square {{was built}} using a double tube system, with a steel core and a {{concrete}} perimeter, and opened for business in 1972. The {{exterior of the}} building is clad in Italian travertine (limestone) and <b>bronze</b> <b>glass.</b> There has been concern over the years regarding the limestone's integrity during severe weather such as tropical systems. Fortunately, these fears did not play out during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 and the building weathered the storm with minimal damage, such as blown out windows and rain damage. The building reopened to tenants in December 2005.|$|E
50|$|Pennzoil Place, {{developed}} and managed by Gerald D. Hines Interests, {{consists of two}} 495 ft trapezoidal towers placed ten feet apart and sheathed in dark <b>bronze</b> <b>glass</b> and aluminum. The buildings are mirror images of each other. The entire street-level plaza joining the two structures is enclosed in a 115 ft glass pyramid-shaped atrium. Deliberately designed as an optical illusion, Pennzoil Place's appearance will {{vary depending on the}} different locations from where it is viewed. Pennzoil Place is considered significant in architectural circles for breaking the modernist glass box design made popular by followers of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and for introducing the era of postmodernism. The buildings combined contain 1400000 sq ft of leasable space.|$|E

50|$|By 1954 Graves {{was feeling}} oppressed both by resurgent {{popularity}} and the encroachment of suburban development around his home. After spending several weeks in Japan, he rented Careladen to the poet Theodore Roethke {{and moved to}} Ireland. With companions Richard Svare and Dorothy Schumacher he lived {{in various parts of}} the country before settling on Woodton Manor, a rustic 18th century house near Dublin. In Ireland he created paintings known as the Hibernation series and became fascinated with the night sky. This led to Instruments for a New Navigation, a collection of precisely rendered <b>bronze,</b> <b>glass,</b> and stone sculptures inspired by the dawning Space Age. Finding no market for these unusual pieces, they were disassembled and not displayed again until 1999.|$|E
