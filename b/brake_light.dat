5|$|In December 1989, Lexus {{initiated}} a voluntary recall of all 8,000 LS 400s based upon two customer complaints over defective wiring and an overheated <b>brake</b> <b>light.</b> A 20-day operation {{to replace the}} parts on affected vehicles included technicians to pick up, repair and return cars to customers free of charge, and also flying personnel and renting garage space for owners in remote locations. This response was covered in media publications and helped establish the marque's early reputation for customer service.|$|E
25|$|For the 1983 model year, the Volkswagen {{received}} new {{front seats}} with adjustable headrests, already seen in cars such the Caribe and the Atlantic. A newly added item was the hand <b>brake</b> <b>light</b> on the dashboard. 1983 also introduced a limited edition Aubergine Metallic paint scheme.

The video from Slager's dashcam shows him approaching Scott's car, speaking to Scott, and then returning to his patrol car. Scott exited his car and fled with Slager giving chase on foot.|$|E

40|$|Rear-end {{collisions}} {{comprise a}} large proportion of all vehicle crashes. A variant of the standard centre high mounted stop light (CHMSL) that flashes under conditions of heavy braking was developed to reduce the incidence and severity of rear-end collisions. The developer of the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light</b> commissioned MUARC to conduct a driving simulator evaluation of the effectiveness of the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light.</b> Forty-two participants completed a series of simulator drives that were designed to examine whether participants’ braking performance under certain conditions was more effective in response to a heavily braking vehicle fitted with the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light</b> compared with a heavily braking vehicle fitted with a standard CHMSL. Among other things, it was found that, relative to the CHMSL condition, participants reacted by braking in a shorter time at an intermediate headway to the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light,</b> and <b>braked</b> harder in response to the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light</b> at both a near and intermediate headway. The results suggest that the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light</b> is a device that, through widespread use, may contribute to a reduction in the incidence and severity of rear-end collisions...|$|R

25|$|While 1985 {{was to be}} {{the last}} year of the second {{generation}} model, delays in production of the third generation model led to a surplus of second generation Supras. During the first half of 1986 the 1985 P-type was still offered for sale, with only minor cosmetic changes as well as the addition of a now mandatory rear-mounted third <b>brake</b> <b>light</b> on the hatch. These were all labelled officially as 1986 models. P-types were the only model available in 1986.|$|E
25|$|The {{shooting}} of Walter Scott occurred on , 2015, in North Charleston, South Carolina, following a daytime traffic {{stop for a}} non-functioning <b>brake</b> <b>light.</b> Scott, an unarmed black man, was fatally shot by Michael Slager, a white North Charleston police officer, after resisting arrest. The race difference led many {{to believe that the}} shooting was racially motivated, generating a widespread controversy. Slager was charged with murder after a video surfaced which showed him shooting Scott from behind while Scott was fleeing, and which contradicted his police report.|$|E
500|$|In December 1989, {{shortly after}} the LS 400's launch, Lexus ordered a {{voluntary}} recall of the 8,000 vehicles sold so far, based upon two customer complaints over defective wiring and an overheated <b>brake</b> <b>light.</b> All vehicles were serviced within 20 days, and the incident helped establish Lexus' customer service reputation. By 1990, U.S. sales of the LS 400 had surpassed those of competing Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Jaguar models. Production of the first-generation LS 400 totaled over 165,000 units. Years after its introduction, the LS 400 remained a reliable choice for a used car, making the Consumer Reports 2007 list of recommended vehicles that regularly last [...] or more, with proper maintenance.|$|E

2500|$|For 1959, the Oldsmobile line-up was {{completely}} redesigned. However, unlike other GM makes (such as Chevrolet and Cadillac) Oldsmobile {{continued to use}} a full perimeter frame, instead of the GM X-frame. The 98 shared its appearance with the Oldsmobile 88.

2500|$|For 1985, Grand Prix's now {{included}} a new checkerboard grille design, {{as well as}} an optional two tone paint scheme with a fading body stripe. The octagonal 'GP' logo also returned to the taillights. 1985 marked the last year for the flat rear deck panel in the interior, as by 1986 laws mandated cars to have a third <b>brake</b> <b>light</b> installed. New rectangular digital ETR stereo system options were introduced and replaced the dial pushbutton stereos. Some more rarer options specific for the 1985 Pontiac Grand Prix include a factory rear spoiler, rare aluminum turbo finned wheels, and a full size spare tire. The standard engine for 1985 was the [...] Buick built 3.8L V6 with a [...] Chevy 5.0L V8 optional. The 5.7L Olds Diesel V8 was dropped from the option list.

2500|$|A {{new model}} was {{introduced}} for 1966; the Galaxie 500 7 Litre, {{fitted with a}} new engine, the 345hp [...] Thunderbird V8. This engine was also available on the Ford Thunderbird. The police versions received a 360hp version of the 428 known as the 'Police Interceptor' as police cars. The 1966 body style was introduced in Brazil (Ford do Brasil) as a 1967 model; it had the same external dimensions throughout its lifetime until Brazilian production ended in 1983. Safety regulations for 1966 required seat belts front and rear on all new cars sold domestically. The Galaxie 500 would be the #3-selling convertible in the U.S. in 1966, with 27,454 sold; it was beaten by the Mustang (at 72,119, by more than 2:1) and by the Impala at 38,000.

2500|$|Between 2009 and 2010, {{development}} {{took place}} on further updates to the second generation S-197. In late 2010 design work (by Robert Gelardi) was frozen, with prototypes being first spotted in May 2011. On November 2, 2011, Ford unveiled the 2013 model year Mustang. The 2013 model year Mustang exterior was updated with a new front fascia featuring a larger grille, standard HID headlamps and two LED accent strips adjacent to the headlamp lens. Models equipped with the Pony Package offered LED lighting mounted on the sideview mirrors that produce a projection of a running horse on the ground, 18" [...] wheels, and lower valence foglamps. In the rear, LED tail lamp clusters included sequential turn signals (as with 2010-2012 Mustangs) and a reverse indicator light integrated within the <b>brake</b> <b>light.</b> The trunk lid included a black panel that united {{the left and right}} tail lamp clusters. Several new wheel designs were offered.|$|E
2500|$|Standard {{equipment}} included automatic transmission, {{power steering}} and brakes, power windows, clock, padded dash, foam padded seats, parking <b>brake</b> <b>light,</b> Deluxe steering wheel, special wheel covers, windshield washer and two-speed electric wipers, courtesy and glovebox lamps, and front seat belts. Standard tire size was 8.55 x 14inches. A new three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission with torque converter replaced the dismal three speed Roto Hydramatic that Oldsmobile {{had been using}} {{for the last three}} model years. Along with the transmission and redesigned platform, the engine was also new for 1965. It was a [...] Super Rocket V8 that was more powerful and of a more efficient design than the older [...] Rocket V8 previously used, yet it was much lighter in weight.

2500|$|In Europe {{and other}} {{countries}} adhering to UN Regulation 48, vehicles must be equipped {{with one or two}} bright red [...] "rear fog lamps", which serve as high-intensity rear position lamps to be turned on by the driver in conditions of poor visibility to make the vehicle more visible from the rear. The allowable range of intensity for a rear fog lamp is 150 to 300 candela, which is within the range of a U.S. stop lamp (<b>brake</b> <b>light).</b> Rear fog lamps are not required equipment in the U.S., but they are permitted, and are found almost exclusively on European-brand vehicles in North America. Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes, MINI, Land Rover, Porsche, Saab and Volvo provide functional rear fog lights on their North American models. Some vehicles from non-European brands which are adaptions of European-market offerings, such as the first generation Ford Transit Connect, come standard with rear fog lights, or vehicles with European market counterparts, such as the second generation Chrysler 300, have an option for them. The final generation Oldsmobile Aurora also had dual rear fog lights installed in the rear bumper as standard equipment.|$|E
