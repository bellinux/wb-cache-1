60|$|Not {{that the}} Wimpole Street bachelors objected. When she {{consulted}} them, Higgins {{declined to be}} bothered about her housing problem when that solution was so simple. Eliza's desire to have Freddy {{in the house with}} her seemed of no more importance than if she had wanted an extra piece of <b>bedroom</b> <b>furniture.</b> Pleas as to Freddy's character, and the moral obligation on him to earn his own living, were lost on Higgins. He denied that Freddy had any character, and declared that if he tried to do any useful work some competent person would have the trouble of undoing it: a procedure involving a net loss to the community, and great unhappiness to Freddy himself, who was obviously intended by Nature for such light work as amusing Eliza, which, Higgins declared, was a much more useful and honorable occupation than working in the city. When Eliza referred again to her project of teaching phonetics, Higgins abated not a jot of his violent opposition to it. He said she was not within ten years of being qualified to meddle with his pet subject; and as it was evident that the Colonel agreed with him, she felt she could not go against them in this grave matter, and that she had no right, without Higgins's consent, to exploit the knowledge he had given her; for his knowledge seemed to her as much his private property as his watch: Eliza was no communist. Besides, she was superstitiously devoted to them both, more entirely and frankly after her marriage than before it.|$|E
60|$|Fortunately for the repose of Morgan, who, {{under other}} circumstances, would have {{discovered}} {{on the very}} first day that his airy retreat was by no means high enough to place him out of Jessie's reach, the idea of settling herself instantly in her new habitation excluded every other idea from the mind of our fair guest. She pinned up the nankeen-colored traveling dress in festoons all round her on the spot; informed us that we were now about to make acquaintance with her in the new character of a woman of business; and darted downstairs in mad high spirits, screaming for Matilda and the trunks like a child for a set of new toys. The wholesome protest of Nature against the artificial restraints of modern life expressed itself in all that she said and in all that she did. She had never known what it was to be happy before, because she had never been allowed, until now, to do anything for herself. She was down on her knees at one moment, blowing the fire, and telling us that she felt like Cinderella; she was up on a table the next, attacking the cobwebs with a long broom, and wishing she had been born a housemaid. As for my unfortunate friend, the upholsterer, he was leveled to the ranks at the first effort he made to assume the command of the domestic forces in the furniture department. She laughed at him, pushed him about, disputed all his conclusions, altered all his arrangements, and ended by ordering half his <b>bedroom</b> <b>furniture</b> to be taken back again, for the one unanswerable reason that she meant to do without it.|$|E
50|$|The facade's design {{resembles the}} style of houses in Plovdiv. The frescoes at the upper floor were crafted in 1896. The {{exposition}} represents the role of Rousse as a gateway towards Europe, and the influx of European urban culture into Bulgaria {{at the end of}} the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. Sample interior layouts are shown, of a drawing-room, a living-room, a music hall and a <b>bedroom,</b> with <b>furniture</b> from Vienna, as well as collections of urban clothing, of jewelry and other accessories, of silverware (cutlery) and china, which mark the changes present in the daily life of Rousse citizens.

There is an early-day kitchen with a cast-iron cook stove and a primitive ice box. A restored <b>bedroom</b> depicts <b>furniture</b> purchased from local stores in the early 1900's, including a washstand, dresser, and bed. A parlour shows a later period as Hereford had prospered to allow citizens to own nice furniture, a pump organ, and other items for family entertainment.|$|R

Several large-scale masterpieces are displayed in the hall, including two John Singer Sargent portraits of Biltmore's architect, Richard Morris Hunt, and landscaper, Frederick Law Olmsted, both commissioned for the home by Vanderbilt. Located nearby in the south tower is George Vanderbilt's gilded <b>bedroom</b> with <b>furniture</b> designed by Hunt.

Came down, with evidently dwindling respect, to things that were still ruinously expensive. I told him we wanted an idyll--love in a cottage, {{and all that kind of}} thing. He brushed that on one side, said idols were upstairs in the Japanese Department, and that perhaps we might do with a servant's set of <b>bedroom</b> <b>furniture.</b> Do with a set! He was a gloomy man with (I should judge) some {{internal}} pain. I tried to tell him that there was quite a lot of middle-class people like myself in the country, people of limited or precarious means, whose existence he seemed to ignore; assured him some of them led quite beautiful lives. But he had no ideas beyond wardrobes. I quite forgot the business of shopping in an attempt to kindle a little human enthusiasm in his heart. We were in a great vast place full of wardrobes, with a remote glittering vista of brass bedsteads--skeleton beds, you know--and I tried to inspire him with some of the poetry of his emporium; tried to make him imagine these beds and things going east and west, north and south, to take sorrow, servitude, joy, worry, failing strength, restless ambition in their impartial embraces. He only turned round to Annie, and asked her if she thought she could do with 'enamelled.' But I was quite taken with my idea----Where is it? I left Annie to settle with this misanthrope, amidst his raw frameworks of the Homes of the Future." ...|$|E

It was the prettiest and most luxurious little sitting-room I had ever seen; and I admired it with the warmest enthusiasm.|$|R

On the ground floor is the less formal family, dining and kitchen space - as well as access to the courtyard. Located across from the courtyard are the children's quarters. The internal courtyard has surrounding glazed walls, which protect it from wind and rain but not light - they also allow for a visual connection between the separate buildings. Corridors along the sides of the courtyard provide access for the children to their quarters which contain three bedrooms (one with a study) and a bathroom. There is a lane situated behind the children's quarters, used as a carport.|$|R
50|$|From 1929 to 1939, Andersen {{worked in}} Klint's studio, {{becoming}} {{one of his most}} trusted colleagues. Thanks to her competent, self-assured approach, she was soon an indispensable contributor to many of the studio's projects. In 1931, she was assigned her first independent task, designing furniture for Kvinderegensen, a women's student residence on Amager Boulevard in Copenhagen. The building's architect, Helge Bojsen-Møller, was reluctant to allow a young lady to handle the assignment but Andersen, appreciating the nature of the task, created a series of simple, almost timeless pieces of furniture and carefully developed plans for the different rooms: the assembly hall, the library and 56 <b>bedrooms.</b> The <b>furniture</b> for the communal rooms was in mahogany with leather upholstery, that for the students' rooms in beech. The bedrooms were fitted out with a bed, desk, bookcase, two chairs (one with arms) and a stool. The assignment led to her collaborating with several furniture makers, as she produced items which were frequently exhibited at the Cabinetmakers Guild's annual fairs. Among her exhibits were a bedroom in elm and mahogany as well as chairs, desks and some 50 semicircular tables with flaps in African mahogany. In 1966, she was responsible for designing the graphics room at Maribo Museum and, in 1980, she exhibited a bureau at Den Permanente, a design exhibition for craftsmen and producers.|$|R

5000|$|Rick Swan {{reviewed}} Castles Forlorn for Dragon magazine #205 (May 1994). According to Swan, the set {{features a}} [...] "terrific castle", citing its twist of existing simultaneously in three time periods. He describes the results as [...] "startling, {{to say the}} least. A door appears, then disappears. A dark passage fills with light, then goes dark again. A plush <b>bedroom</b> with expensive <b>furniture</b> becomes a musty chamber piled with debris, with bloody hand prints smeared on the walls." [...] He noted that while the text offers sensible suggestions for handling paradoxes and measuring time, [...] "the text includes everything but a developed adventure; instead, we're given an assortment of hazards and encouraged to [...] "build tension gradually by saving the nastiest surprises for last." [...] That's easier said than done, especially for novice referees who require a lot more structure than this to get a campaign off the ground." [...] He felt that the Forlorn material [...] "mixes the clever with the ordinary", noting that while Tristen ApBlanc [...] "could teach Count Strahd {{a thing or two}} about ghastliness", a lot of the other material [...] "seems like filler", in that some of the locations such as the Sacred Groves and the Caverns of the Dead [...] "aren't much more interesting than their names", some of the ghostly NPCs [...] "work better as obstacles than personalities", and Aggie, [...] "a clone of the Loch Ness Monster, doesn't have much to do other than pose for the cover". Swan concluded the review by saying: [...] "In the hands of a creative referee, Castles Forlorn can be a source of endless surprise. If, for instance, the party steals a book from a room in Castle C, then later tosses a fireball into the Castle A incarnation of the same room, the stolen book may turn to ash in their hands. Think of the Forlorn material as a bonus; get this for the castle." ...|$|R
