5|$|An infant's {{internal}} working {{model is}} developed {{in response to}} the infant's experience of the outcomes of his or her proximity-seeking behaviors.

There are several types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests that it {{may be useful}} in improving the acceptance of existing pain.|$|E

If a bee is {{sufficiently}} intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees typically have many more flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social <b>behaviors,</b> <b>and</b> has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides.

5|$|In {{comparison}} to dogs, cats have not undergone major changes during the domestication process, as {{the form and}} behavior of the domestic cat is not radically {{different from those of}} wildcats and domestic cats are perfectly capable of surviving in the wild. Fully domesticated house cats often interbreed with feral F. catus populations, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat. This limited evolution during domestication means that hybridisation can occur with many other felids, notably the Asian leopard cat. Several natural <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> characteristics of wildcats may have predisposed them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play and relatively high intelligence. Several small felid species may have an inborn tendency towards tameness.|$|E
