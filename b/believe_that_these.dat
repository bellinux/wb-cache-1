5|$|Genetic {{research}} in mid-2014 by the British Antarctic Survey {{confirmed that the}} separate populations in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern Oceans are more distinct than previously thought. Some biologists <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> {{should be regarded as}} separate subspecies and that they are evolving independently.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{surveys have}} found {{evidence}} that Native Americans used the immediate vicinity of Yucca Mountain on a temporary or seasonal basis. Some Native Americans disagree with the conclusions of archaeological investigators that their ancestors were highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers who occupied the Yucca Mountain area before Euroamericans began using the area for prospecting, surveying, and ranching. They <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> conclusions overlook traditional accounts of farming that occurred before European contact.|$|E
5|$|Other economists <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> {{elements}} cannot completely {{explain the}} dramatic {{rise and fall}} in tulip prices. Garber's theory has also been challenged for failing to explain a similar dramatic rise and fall in prices for regular tulip bulb contracts. Some economists also point to other factors associated with speculative bubbles, such as a growth in the supply of money, demonstrated {{by an increase in}} deposits at the Bank of Amsterdam during that period.|$|E

5|$|In {{statements}} to the Polícia Judiciária, witnesses described men behaving oddly near apartment 5A {{in the days leading}} up to the disappearance and on the day itself. Scotland Yard came to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> men may have been engaged in reconnaissance, either for an abduction or a burglary. There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which burglars had entered through windows.|$|E
5|$|It {{is found}} in Upper Cretaceous {{formations}} {{of central and eastern}} Asia; fossils have been found in Mongolia, Kazakhstan and China. In the Nanxiong formation in Southern China, Macroolithus fossils range up to and possibly over the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, which is traditionally assumed to mark the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. Some paleontologists have interpreted the record of dinosaur eggs at this formation as supporting a gradual extinction event, rather than a sudden cataclysmic event. However, other paleontologists <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> interpretations are merely based on artifacts of erosion and redeposition in the early Paleogene.|$|E
5|$|Plastromancy: The {{earliest}} use of turtle shells {{comes from}} the archaeological site in Jiahu site. The shells, containing small pebbles of various size, colour and quantity, were drilled with small holes, suggesting that each pair of them was tied together originally. Similar finds have also {{been found in the}} Dawenkou burial sites of about 4000–3000 BC, as well as in Henan, Sichuan, Jiangsu and Shaanxi. The turtle-shell shakers for the most part are made of the shell of land turtles, identified as Cuora flavomarginata. Archaeologists <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> shells were used either as rattles in ceremonial dances, shamantic healing tools or ritual paraphernalia for divinational purposes.|$|E

5|$|This species {{grows in}} at least 2 {{distinct}} sub-populations, {{both of which are}} well protected by Sabah National Parks Authority. One of the populations grows in an area public access to which is strictly prohibited without permit. However, there has been a decline in population of mature individuals in the better known and less patrolled site. This is largely due to damage to habitat and plants by careless visitors rather than organised collection of plants. Nepenthes rajah has become common in cultivation in recent years {{as a result of the}} availability of inexpensive clones from tissue culture. I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> days commercial collection of this species from the wild is negligible.|$|E
5|$|Heathen deities are {{not seen}} as perfect, omnipotent, and omnipresent, and are instead viewed as having their own {{strengths}} and weaknesses. Many practitioners <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> deities will one day die, as did, for instance, the god Baldr in Norse mythology. Heathens view their connection with their deities not as being that of a master and servant but rather as an interdependent relationship akin {{to that of a}} family. For them, these deities serve as both examples and role models whose behavior is to be imitated. Many practitioners believe that they can communicate with these deities, as well as negotiate, bargain, and argue with them, and hope that through venerating them, practitioners will gain wisdom, understanding, power, or visionary insights.|$|E
5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem {{lies in the fact that}} every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E

25|$|Male {{hind legs}} are {{specialized}} to store aromatic compounds. There can {{be up to}} seventy compounds in each tibia. Some researchers <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> compounds are used to form male leks, while others believe that the compounds may be changed into sex hormones. Still others <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> aromatic compounds may be a courtship gift or an anti-predator ward. In 2005, Thomas Eltz and his research group discovered that male Eufriesea will release different aromatic compounds using complex leg maneuvers, giving credence to the hypothesis that these compounds {{play a role in}} mating, though they may have multiple uses.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{according}} to macroeconomic theory, a well-regulated fractional-reserve bank system also benefits {{the economy by}} providing regulators with powerful tools for influencing the money supply and interest rates.

25|$|More rabbinically {{traditional}} Reform and Reconstructionist Jews <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> halakhoth {{in general}} may be valid, {{but that it}} is up to each individual to decide how and when to apply them.

25|$|Reflecting on {{his career}} in {{medicine}} years later, Crichton concluded that patients too often shunned {{responsibility for their own}} health, relying on doctors as miracle workers rather than advisors. He experimented with astral projection, aura viewing, and clairvoyance, coming to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> included real phenomena that scientists had too eagerly dismissed as paranormal.|$|E
50|$|Even so, many Experiment Station {{researchers}} <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> limited outreach {{efforts were}} insufficient.
