40|$|In bimanual coordination, {{interactions}} between the limbs result in attraction to in-phase and antiphase coordination. Increasing movement frequency leads to decreasing stability of antiphase coordination, often resulting in a transition to the more stable in-phase pattern. It is unknown, however, how this frequency-induced loss of stability is engendered {{in terms of the}} interlimb interactions underwriting bimanual coordination. The present study was conducted to help resolve this issue. Using an established method (based on comparison of various unimanual and bimanual tasks involving both passive and active movements), three sources of interlimb interaction were dissociated: (1) <b>integrated</b> <b>timing</b> of feedforward signals, (2) afference-based correction of relative phase errors, and (3) phase entrainment by contralateral afference. Results indicated that phase entrainment strength remained unaffected by frequency and that the stabilizing effects of error correction and <b>integrated</b> <b>timing</b> decreased with increasing frequency. Their contributions, however, reflected an interesting interplay as frequency increased. For moderate frequencies coordinative stability was predominantly secured by <b>integrated</b> <b>timing</b> processes. However, at high frequencies, the stabilization of the antiphase pattern required combined contributions of both <b>integrated</b> <b>timing</b> and error correction. In sum, increasing frequency was found to induce a shift from predominantly open-loop control to more closed-loop control. The results may be accounted for by means of an internal forward model for sensorimotor integration in which the sensory signals are compared to values predicted on the basis of efference copies. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Because bimanual coordinative {{stability}} {{is governed by}} interlimb coupling, we examined how learning a new pattern (90 °) was reflected in changes in the underlying interlimb interactions. Three interlimb interaction sources were distinguished: <b>integrated</b> <b>timing</b> of feedforward control signals, error corrections based on perceived relative phase, and phase entrainment by contralateral afference. By comparing 4 tasks that involve these interactions to a different extent, changes in the stabilizing contributions of these coupling sources could be studied. Furthermore, we studied how the learning process {{and changes in the}} underlying interactions were influenced by attentional focus (internal vs. external), and we examined retention of the learned pattern and transfer to the mirror-symmetrical pattern (270 °). Results showed that stability and accuracy of the new pattern increased significantly with learning, due to improved <b>integrated</b> <b>timing</b> and error correction. <b>Integrated</b> <b>timing</b> improved first, possibly providing a reference frame for the error corrections that subsequently became more effective. Despite some qualitative differences in the learning process, neither performance of the learned pattern nor the underlying interlimb interactions was influenced by attentional focus. Whereas the learned pattern improved directly after practice, transfer followed later, suggesting that a more general representation was formed at a slower rate after practice. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
