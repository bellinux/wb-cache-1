2500|$|Brain morphometry is a {{subfield}} of both morphometry and {{the brain}} sciences, concerned with the measurement of brain structures and changes thereof during development, aging, learning, disease and evolution. Since autopsy-like dissection is generally impossible on living brains, brain morphometry starts with noninvasive neuroimaging data, typically obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (or MRI for short). These data are <b>born</b> <b>digital,</b> which allows researchers to analyze the brain images further by using advanced mathematical and statistical methods such as shape quantification or multivariate analysis. This allows researchers to quantify anatomical features of the brain in terms of shape, mass, volume (e.g. of the hippocampus, or of the primary versus secondary visual cortex), and to derive more specific information, such as the encephalization quotient, grey matter density and white matter connectivity, gyrification, cortical thickness, or the amount of cerebrospinal fluid. These variables can then be mapped within the brain volume or on the brain surface, providing a convenient way to assess their pattern and extent over time, across individuals or even between different biological species. The field is rapidly evolving along with neuroimaging techniques [...] which deliver the underlying data [...] but also develops in part independently from them, {{as part of the}} emerging field of neuroinformatics, which is concerned with developing and adapting algorithms to analyze those data.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, Digital Libraries {{have become}} a widely used service to store and share both <b>digital</b> <b>born</b> {{documents}} and <b>digital</b> versions of works stored by traditional libraries. Document images are intrinsically non-structured and the structure and semantic of the digitized documents is in most part lost during the conversion.

In this chapter a survey about the more recent techniques applied in the field of recognition and retrieval of text and graphical documents is presented. In particular we describe techniques related to recognition-free approaches. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} contextual {{challenges}} every CALL researcher and practitioner is confronted with is the widespread and somewhat naive idea that since teens are all <b>born</b> as <b>digital</b> natives and since technology has become mainstream, today’s education is technology-driven or is not. Policy makers, civil society and parents tend to conceive of education {{as one of the}} most conservative institutions to the extent teachers are not yet unanimously convinced of the evident benefits of the large-scale use of digital solutions. However attractive may be the sirene call of technology, technology is nothing more than a means to an end. So let’s move beyond the (Ed-) Tech Hype and rather focus on perceived usefulness, actual use and learning effectiveness of technology-enhanced language learning. It’s all about pedagogical quality and added value.
