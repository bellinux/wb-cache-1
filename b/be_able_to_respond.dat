5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the battle for the Donets, as the spring rasputitsa (mud) season came to an end in 1943, both the German and Soviet commands considered their plans for future operations. The Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and some senior Soviet officers wanted to seize the initiative first and attack the German forces inside the Soviet Union, but they were convinced by a number of key commanders, including the Deputy Supreme Commander Georgiy Zhukov, to assume a defensive posture instead. This would allow the German side to weaken themselves in attacking prepared positions, after which the Soviet forces would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> with a counter-offensive.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{article focuses}} on the construction, {{description}} and testing of a theoretical model of problem posing. We operationalize procesess that are frequently described in problem solving and problem posing literature in order to generate a model. We name these processes editing quantitative information, their meanings or relationships, selecting quantitative information, comprehending and organizing quantitative information by giving it meaning or creating relations between provided information, and translating quantitative information from one form to another. The validity and {{the applicability of the}} model is empirically tested using five problem-posing tests with 143 6 th grade students in Cyprus. The analysis shows that three different categories of students can be identified. Category 1 students <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> only <b>to</b> the comprehension tasks. Category 2 students <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> both the comprehension and translation tasks, while Category 3 students <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> all types of tasks.

25|$|The title {{character}} of Babette was initially offered to Catherine Deneuve. Deneuve {{was interested in}} the part but was concerned because she had been criticized in her past attempts to depart from her usual sophisticated woman roles. While Deneuve deliberated for a day, Axel met with French actress Stéphane Audran. Axel remembered Audran from her roles in Claude Chabrol's films Violette Nozière (1978) and Poulet au vinaigre (1985). When Axel asked Chabrol (her former husband) about Audran's suitability, Chabol said Audran was the archetype of Babette. Axel gave the script to Audran, told her that Deneuve was contemplating the role, and asked her if she might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> before the next day. Audran called two hours later and said she wanted the role. The following day, Deneuve declined and Audran was officially cast.|$|E
25|$|This {{led to a}} {{worrying}} scenario {{coming to}} dominate US strategic thinking through the 1970s and 80s. If the Soviets launched a sneak attack on the US using {{only a portion of}} their missile fleet, about , aimed solely at US silos and airbases, they could hope to destroy as much as 90% of the US's fleet. This attack would not kill many civilians, and leave the US with only a few ICBMs and bombers, along with the US Navy's Submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) fleet. However, the SLBMs of that era were not accurate enough to attack missile silos, the US would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> with a counterforce attack against the substantial numbers of remaining Soviet ICBMs. The only option left would be a general attack on Soviet cities, which would cause the Soviets to respond in kind with their remaining fleet. In this situation, the Soviets would be in an extremely advantageous position for a negotiated peace.|$|E
500|$|Memory and naïve B cells {{normally}} {{exist in}} relatively small numbers. [...] As the body needs to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> {{to a large}} number of potential pathogens, it maintains a pool of B cells {{with a wide range of}} specificities. Consequently, while there is almost always at least one B (naive or memory) cell capable of responding to any given epitope (of all that the immune system can react against), there are very few exact duplicates. However, when a single B cell encounters an antigen to which it can bind, it can proliferate very rapidly. Such a group of cells with identical specificity towards the epitope is known as a clone, and is derived from a common [...] "mother" [...] cell. [...] All the [...] "daughter" [...] B cells match the original [...] "mother" [...] cell in their epitope specificity, and they secrete antibodies with identical paratopes. These antibodies are monoclonal antibodies, since they derive from clones of the same parent cell. A polyclonal response is one in which clones of multiple B cells react to the same antigen.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first line}} of defence against {{invasion}} by the PRC is the ROC's own armed forces. Current ROC military doctrine is to hold out against an invasion or blockade until the US military responds. There is, however, no guarantee in the Taiwan Relations Act or any other treaty that the United States will defend Taiwan, even {{in the event of}} invasion. The joint declaration on security between the US and Japan signed in 1996 may imply that Japan would be involved in any response. However, Japan has refused to stipulate whether the [...] "area surrounding Japan" [...] mentioned in the pact includes Taiwan, and the precise purpose of the pact is unclear. The Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty (ANZUS Treaty) may mean that other US allies, such as Australia, could theoretically be involved. In practice, the risk of losing economic ties with China may prevent Australia from taking action.

2500|$|Pharaoh ants utilize 3 {{types of}} pheromones. One is a {{long-lasting}} attractive chemical {{that is used}} to build a trail network. It remains detectable even if the ants do not use the trail for several days. Pharaoh ants cease activity at night and begin each day of work at around 8am, yet parts of the trail network are identical each day. [...] The second pheromone is also attractive, but will decay to imperceptible amounts {{in a matter of minutes}} without reapplication. This pheromone is useful in marking food sources, as these are unpredictable and the colony must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to environmental changes quickly. Individuals will not waste their time on an unprofitable trail route. The third pheromone is a repellant. [...] Pharaoh ants were the first species found to use a negative trail pheromone. If an individual finds an unprofitable area with little food or significant danger, it will release this repellant pheromone, which will warn others and cause them to look elsewhere. While positive pheromones indicating lucrative foraging sites are very common in social insects, the pharaoh ant's negative pheromone is highly unusual. [...] Like the food source marker, the negative pheromone is volatile, decaying roughly two hours after being emitted. It may even be insecticidal in some cases. It is so powerful that an individual can detect it from [...] away. Pharaoh ants utilize this pheromone near forks in the trail network, and an ant that detects it will begin to walk in a zigzag manner.|$|E
2500|$|These {{and other}} {{articles}} describe new challenges and solutions to use BCI technology to help persons with DOC. One major challenge {{is that these}} patients cannot use BCIs based on vision. Hence, new tools rely on auditory and/or vibrotactile stimuli. Patients may wear headphones and/or vibrotactile stimulators placed on the wrists, neck, leg, and/or other locations. Another challenge is that patients may fade {{in and out of}} consciousness, and can only communicate at certain times. This may indeed be a cause of mistaken diagnosis. Some patients may only <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to physicians' requests during a few hours per day (which might not be predictable ahead of time) and thus may have been unresponsive during diagnosis. Therefore, new methods rely on tools that are easy to use in field settings, even without expert help, so family members and other persons without any medical or technical background can still use them. This reduces the cost, time, need for expertise, and other burdens with DOC assessment. Automated tools can ask simple questions that patients can easily answer, such as [...] "Is your father named George?" [...] or [...] "Were you born in the USA?" [...] Automated instructions inform patients that they may convey yes or no by (for example) focusing their attention on stimuli on the right vs. left wrist. This focused attention produces reliable changes in EEG patterns that can help determine that the patient is able to communicate. The results could be presented to physicians and therapists, which could lead to a revised diagnosis and therapy. In addition, these patients could then be provided with BCI-based communication tools that could help them convey basic needs, adjust bed position and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), and otherwise empower them to make major life decisions and communicate.|$|E
