25|$|Researchers {{classify}} debris {{as either}} land- or ocean-based; in 1991, the United Nations Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution estimated {{that up to}} 80% of the pollution was land-based. More recent {{studies have found that}} more than half of plastic debris found on Korean shores is ocean-based. A wide variety of anthropogenic artifacts can become marine debris; plastic bags, balloons, <b>buoys,</b> <b>rope,</b> medical waste, glass bottles and plastic bottles, cigarette stubs, cigarette lighters, beverage cans, polystyrene, lost fishing line and nets, and various wastes from cruise ships and oil rigs are among the items commonly found to have washed ashore. Six pack rings, in particular, are considered emblematic of the problem.|$|R
50|$|It was {{to recover}} the lost cable of these expeditions that the Elba was got ready for sea. Jenkin had fitted her out the year before for laying the Cagliari to Malta and Corfu cables but on this {{occasion}} she was better equipped. She had a new machine for picking up the cable, and a sheave or pulley at the bows for it to run over, both designed by Jenkin, together {{with a variety of}} wooden <b>buoys,</b> <b>ropes,</b> and chains. Liddell, assisted by F. C. Webb and Fleeming Jenkin, {{was in charge of the}} expedition. Jenkin had nothing to do with the electrical work, his care being the deck machinery for raising the cable but it was a responsible job. He reported the expedition in letters to Miss Austin and in diary entries.|$|R
50|$|The {{fish flake}} was a {{permanent}} structure {{that was part}} of the landscape of a fishing village. These were not located too far away from the fishing stages that were built on the shoreline. The flake was built high off the ground and required stable construction with a sloping ramp to gain access to it. The ramp was required such that fishermen carried a full load of fish on barrows was able to negotiate its accent. At one end of the flake was built a building that served dual purposes. The construction of the building, called fish store, was of two story construction and had to be large enough to accommodate a season's voyage of fish on the top level. In the lower section of the fish store was kept the gear that was used for fishing, <b>buoy's,</b> <b>ropes,</b> killicks, grapples and other miscellany items.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is formed}} by the Keystone Dam on the North Platte River. Canal roads can be {{accessed}} east from Highway 61 or north from U.S. 30 at Roscoe and Paxton. Because of steep banks and swift water, no wading, boating or watercraft are permitted in the canal. Anglers fishing from the banks are recommended to wear life jackets. Emergency <b>buoys</b> with <b>ropes</b> are location along the canal. This is a day-use area; no overnight camping is allowed.|$|R
50|$|Hawser systems {{use either}} {{one or two}} ropes {{depending}} on the largest size of vessel which would be moored to the <b>buoy.</b> The <b>ropes</b> would either be single-leg or grommet leg type ropes. These are usually connected to an OCIMF chafe chain on the export tanker side (either type A or B depending on the maximum size of the tanker and the mooring loads). This chafe chain would then {{be held in the}} chain stopper on board the export tanker.|$|R
40|$|Throughout the world's oceans a {{wide variety}} of {{floating}} plastics are found, among which buoys stand out for their high floatability and diversity and abundance of associated organisms. Between 2001 and 2005, we conducted 25 ship surveys in the Bay System of Coquimbo (BSC), during which we registered 34 detached buoys floating between 1 and 45 km from the coast. The objective {{of this study was to}} infer the possible origin of these buoys, identify the associated biota and characterize their biological traits. Short-term drift experiments (30 min) showed that <b>buoys</b> without <b>rope</b> responded primarily to the velocity and direction of the wind, while <b>buoys</b> with <b>ropes</b> (3 m length) followed surface currents. Using the wind velocity and direction during the 12 h before capture of the detached buoys, we estimated the hypothetical trajectories of these buoys during that time period. Results indicated that most buoys originated from aquaculture facilities in the BSC. A total of 134 different species from 14 phyla was found on 18 anchored (91 species) and 22 detached (116 species) buoys sampled. Community composition was similar among buoys - 54 % of all species were common for anchored and detached buoys - but a higher number of rare species occurred on detached buoys. Buoys do not seem to lose but rather gain organisms after detachment. The most common functional groups on these buoys were mobile species, suspension-feeders and species with sexual reproduction, separate sexes, internal fertilization and direct or very short larval development. Fouling communities on detached buoys were mostly in advanced successional stages, comprising diverse species (including several non-indigenous species) adapted to the conditions at the sea surface. These results suggest that floating buoys may transport associated species over extensive distances, thereby also contributing to the spread of non-indigenous species. © Inter-Research 2009. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

2500|$|The Vigili del Fuoco di Genova ("Genovese Fire Service") ashore fired a {{breeches}} buoy from the mole to the midships accommodation block. This was made fast on the ship, and the firemen hauled three Indian crewmen to safety. Captain Muir persuaded his wife Dorothy to go next, but the buoy jammed and flung Mrs Muir from the harness {{to her death}} on the rocks below. Some sources suggest that {{the breaking of the}} ship into two coincided with the fire service's attempt to winch Mrs Muir to safety, that this caused the breeches <b>buoy's</b> [...] nylon <b>rope</b> to flex and this was what caused it first to jam and then to fling Mrs Muir onto the rocks.

50|$|The turn buoys are {{positioned}} 11.5 m {{away from the}} center of the slalom course so as the rope is shortened beyond that the skiers are required to use the momentum generated through their turns to swing up on the side of the boat and reach out in order to get their ski around the next <b>buoy.</b> At this <b>rope</b> length the skier's body is experiencing intense isometric contractions and extreme upper body torque with loads of up to 600 kg as they begin accelerating after rounding a turn buoy. Their top speeds will generally be more than double the boat's speed, which means that the Pro men can reach speeds in excess of 116 km/h and each turn will generally generate around 4 g of force. Essentially, slalom water skiers are using their body as a lever, which allows them to withstand loads that would otherwise not be possible for the human body.|$|R
40|$|Current {{mitigation}} strategies against invasive tunicates on mussel aquaculture gear in Prince Edward Island {{concentrate on}} labour-intensive and costly fouling removal. Instead of removal, this {{study focused on}} preventing the settlement of the vase tunicate Ciona intestinalis and other fouling organisms by applying a layer of food grade oil to gear prior to recruitment. Laboratory tests established the adherence and persistence of shortening, a food grade oil with a melting point exceeding ambient water temperatures, to rope and mussels. In situ tests showed that shortening decreased C. intestinalis weight and abundance on <b>buoys,</b> spat collector <b>ropes</b> and collector plates but not on mussel socks. Fouling by algae and other tunicates was significantly reduced on most substrates. There were no detrimental effects of shortening treatment on mussel length and abundance on mussel socks, but total mussel weight was significantly lower on shortening-treated socks. Shortening treatment did not significantly affect mussel spat settlement on spat collector ropes, but further evaluation is required. Overall, shortening application has considerable potential for reducing tunicate and other fouling, particularly on buoys...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} line {{force of a}} moored {{floating}} buoy. The experiment was the first experiment made at the Swedish wave energy research area located close to Lysekil on the Swedish west coast. The Lysekil project {{is run by the}} Swedish Centre for Renewable Electric Energy Conversion at Uppsala University.                   The experimental set-up consists of a cylindrical buoy, with a diameter of 3 m and a height of 0. 8 m. The buoy is moored with a line connected to a set of springs in parallel with a rope. The rope in parallel with the springs represents the limited stroke length of a linear generator type wave energy converter. The measurement system consists of a force transducer between the <b>buoy</b> and the <b>rope,</b> a three axis accelerometer inside the buoy and a data logger remotely operated through the GSM network.      The peak forces related to the significant wave height showed a trend of 33 kN/m. Trends was also calculated in 10 kN bins. The data could be used in fatigue simulations of similar devices. The result was used when dimensioning the wave energy converter that was installed in March 2006. The Lysekil Projec...|$|R
40|$|INGINE Inc. {{developed}} its own {{wave energy}} converter (WEC) named INWAVE and has currently installed three prototype modules in Jeju Island, Korea. This device is an on-shore-type WEC that consists of a buoy, pulleys fixed to the sea-floor and a power take off module (PTO). Three ropes are moored tightly {{on the bottom of}} the buoy and connected to the PTO via the pulleys, which are moving back and forth according to the motion of the buoy. Since the device can harness wave energy from all six degrees of movement of the buoy, it is possible to extract energy efficiently even under low energy density conditions provided in the coastal areas. In the PTO module, the ratchet gears convert the reciprocating movement of the rope drum into a uni-directional rotation and determine the transmission of power from the relation of the angular velocities between the rope drum and the generator. In this process, the discontinuity of the power transmission occurs and causes the modeling divergence. Therefore, we introduce the concept of the virtual torsion spring in order to prevent the impact error in the ratchet gear module, thereby completing the PTO modeling. In this paper, we deal with dynamic analysis in the time domain, based on Newtonian mechanics and linear wave theory. We derive the combined dynamics of the buoy and PTO modules via geometric relation between the <b>buoy</b> and mooring <b>ropes,</b> then suggest the ratchet gear mechanism with the virtual torsion spring element to reduce the dynamic errors during the phase transitions. Time domain simulation is carried out under irregular waves that reflect the actual wave states of the installation area, and we evaluate the theoretical performance using the capture width ratio...|$|R
40|$|With growing {{economies and}} better living {{standards}} {{in many parts}} of the world today, there is a need of expanding the capacity of generating electricity. The alternatives for renewable energy technologies are not fully developed and have still some problems to conquer. The company Minesto has developed a technology that is called Deep Green. It is designed to gain electricity from tidal currents. Deep Green works in a similar way as a kite that is attached to the seafloor with a moving wire. It contains of a wing that moves due to the water current. The path of the movement is circular or a shape of an “ 8 ”. The turbine under the wing is powered by the water flow which in turn leads to generation of electricity by the generator. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the potential of using the Deep Green technology in ocean currents with respect to construction and economy. The site for the investigation is off the east coast of Florida where the Florida current streams with a speed of about 1, 5 m/s close to the surface. The major difference compared to the use in tidal currents is the deep waters of about 300 m and a oneway current direction. A mooring construction was developed and optimized and with the use of carbon fiber <b>ropes,</b> <b>buoys</b> and foundations lets 9 Deep Greens operate between 20 and 79 m depth. The idea is to install 7 such clusters with a total of 63 Deep Greens on the site in Florida. This configuration generates a power of 24 MW and gives a production of 185 GWh/year. Economic accounts were made with support of earlier made calculations regarding a park of 60 Deep Greens in a tidal current application. The results for the clustered configuration in ocean currents indicated a cost of 0, 67 SEK/kWh with a discount rate of 8 %. The required capital for the installation is about 780 mSEK (CAPEX). The operating costs (OPEX) are 43, 3 mSEK. The design seems reasonable in many respects and it operates in a continuous ocean current with good electricity generation. The use of Deep Green in ocean currents speaks for being a profitable application. Though, it will be a large‐scale economic project, mainly because installations in a small scale will not be profitable due to costs such as grid connection. Critical issues to look at in a further development was considered to be surveys of the installation site, the displacement and movements of the mooring, the buoyancy‐system and the installation procedure...|$|R
