25|$|Sloths are mammals {{classified}} in {{the families}} Megalonychidae (two-toed sloths) and <b>Bradypodidae</b> (three-toed sloths). There are six extant species of sloths. They are named after the capital sin of sloth because they seem slow and lazy at first glance; however, their usual idleness is due to metabolic adaptations for conserving energy. Aside from their surprising bursts of speed during emergency flights from predators, other notable traits of sloths include their strong body, the ability to swim, {{and the fact that}} they host symbiotic algae on their fur.|$|E
2500|$|Currently living sloths belong {{largely to}} two families, Megalonychidae ("two-toed" [...] sloths) and <b>Bradypodidae</b> (three-toed sloths). All living sloths {{have in fact}} three toes; the [...] "two-toed" [...] sloths, however, have only two fingers. Two-toed sloths {{generally}} move faster than three-toed sloths. Both types tend to occupy the same forests; in most areas, one species of three-toed sloth and one species of the larger two-toed sloth will jointly predominate.|$|E
5000|$|This {{family is}} related to the other {{families}} of extinct ground sloths, Megatheriidae, Mylodontidae, Nothrotheriidae, and Scelidotheriidae. The only extant families of the suborder Folivora are <b>Bradypodidae</b> and Megalonychidae.|$|E
50|$|Modern sloths {{are divided}} into two {{families}} {{based on the number}} of toes on their front feet, Megalonychidae and <b>Bradypodidae.</b> Linnaeus's two-toed sloth and Hoffmann's two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni) belong to the family Megalonychidae, which included extinct ground sloths.|$|E
50|$|The {{three-toed sloths}} are tree-living mammals from South and Central America. They {{are the only}} members of the genus Bradypus and the family <b>Bradypodidae.</b> The four living species of three-toed sloths are the brown-throated sloth, the maned sloth, the pale-throated sloth, and the pygmy three-toed sloth.|$|E
50|$|Scelidotheriinae is a {{subfamily}} of extinct ground sloths {{within the}} order Pilosa, suborder Folivora and family Mylodontidae, {{related to the}} other extinct mylodontid subfamilies, Lestodontinae and Mylodontinae. The only extant families of the suborder Folivora are <b>Bradypodidae</b> and Megalonychidae. Erected as the family Scelidotheriidae by Ameghino in 1889, the taxon was demoted to a subfamily by Gaudin in 1995.|$|E
50|$|Chloepus didactylus {{are larger}} than three-toed sloths. They have longer hair, bigger eyes, and their back and front legs are more equal in length. Their ears, hind feet and head are {{generally}} larger than <b>Bradypodidae.</b> They do however have a shorter tail. Their shoulder height, the height from the shoulder blade to {{the tips of the}} claw is longer than three-toed sloths, indicating longer arms.|$|E

50|$|The pygmy three-toed sloth {{is one of}} {{the four}} members of the genus Bradypus, and is {{classified}} under the family <b>Bradypodidae.</b> A 2004 phylogenetic analysis suggested that Bradypus is sister to all other folivorans. The generic name Bradypus is the combination of two Greek words: brady ("slow") and pous ("foot"). The specific name pygmaeus comes from the Greek pugmaios ("as small as a fist"). 'Monk sloth' and 'dwarf sloth' are two other names for this sloth.|$|E

40|$|We sequenced {{part of the}} 16 S rRNA {{mitochondrial}} gene in 17 extant taxa of Pilosa (sloths and anteaters) and used these sequences along with GenBank sequences of both extant and extinct sloths to perform phylogenetic analysis based on parsimony, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods. By increasing the taxa density for anteaters and sloths {{we were able to}} clarify some points of the Pilosa phylogenetic tree. Our mitochondrial 16 S results show <b>Bradypodidae</b> as a monophyletic and robustly supported clade in all the analysis. However, the Pleistocene fossil Mylodon darwinii does not group significantly to either <b>Bradypodidae</b> or Megalonychidae which indicates that trichotomy best represents the relationship between the families Mylodontidae, <b>Bradypodidae</b> and Megalonychidae. Divergence times also allowed us to discuss the taxonomic status of Cyclopes and the three species of three-toed sloths, Bradypus tridactylus, Bradypus variegatus and Bradypus torquatus. In the <b>Bradypodidae</b> the split between Bradypus torquatus and the proto-Bradypus tridactylus / B. variegatus was estimated as about 7. 7 million years ago (MYA), while in the Myrmecophagidae the first offshoot was Cyclopes at about 31. 8 MYA followed by the split between Myrmecophaga and Tamandua at 12. 9 MYA. We estimate the split between sloths and anteaters to have occurred at about 37 MYA...|$|E
40|$|Amblyomma varium, {{commonly}} known in Brazil as the "carrapato-gigante-da-preguiça" (sloth's giant tick) is found from southern Central America to Argentina. The present study adds {{information on the}} geographical distribution of A. varium, {{as well as on}} their hosts, based on material deposited in the main Brazilian collections and on the available literature. Eighty-two vials, containing 191 adult specimens, deposited in five Acari collections between 1930 and 2001, were examined. These vials included data on the host and collection localities. The biology of A. varium is unknown. However it is known that, during the adult stage, the tick presents a high host specificity and is found almost exclusively on the sloths Bradypus tridactylus, B. variegatus, B. torquatus (<b>Bradypodidae),</b> Choloepus hoffmanni and C. didactylus (Megalonychidae). Based on the material examined, the states of Rondônia, Amazonas, Bahia and Alagoas are newly assigned to geographic distribution of A. varium in Brazil...|$|E
40|$|The {{mammalian}} fauna of Nicaragua includes seven {{species in}} the order Xenarthra, including the brown-throated three-toed sloth (Bradypus variegatus) in the family <b>Bradypodidae,</b> Hoffmann 2 ̆ 7 s two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni) in the family Megalonychidae, the northern naked-tailed armadillo (Cabassous centralis) and nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) in the family Dasypodidae, and the silky anteater (Cyclopes didactylus) and northern tamandua (Tamandua mexicana) in the family Myrmecophagidae. Additionally, the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) in the family Myrmecophagidae is (or was) certainly part of the fauna of Nicaragua but {{has yet to be}} documented there. Based on 133 xenarthran specimens available in museums and our observations, we herein review and provide new information on distributions, systematics, morphometrics, and natural history of these species in Nicaragua. Replacement of the milk dentition in Dasypus novemcinctus is described and illustrated, documenting the most common adult dental formula of i 0 / 0, c 0 / 0, p 7 / 7, m 1 / 1 = 32...|$|E
40|$|Amblyomma varium Koch, 1844 is a Neotropical tick, {{known as}} the `sloth`s giant tick`, with records from {{southern}} Central America to Argentina. It is found almost exclusively on mammals of the families <b>Bradypodidae</b> and Magalonychidae (Xenarthra). Differences exist in discussions {{with regard to the}} dentition of the female hypostome being either 3 / 3 or 4 / 4. The male was also originally described as having a short spur on coxa IV, but some specimens recently collected from different Brazilian localities have this spur three times longer. These differences beg the question of whether {{there is more than one}} species included under this taxon. In order to answer this question and to clarify the taxonomic characters of this species, 258 adult specimens were examined, and a redescription of male and female based on light and scanning electron microscopy is provided. In addition, DNA was extracted from males with either a long or a short spur on coxa IV to help settle this question for future investigations on their taxonomy. The morphological study showed that the dental formula pattern for males and females is 3 / 3 and 4 / 4, respectively. When sequenced, the 12 S rDNA genes of both A. varium males with long and short spurs on coxa IV were found to be identical, indicating that the length of the spurs on coxa IV is likely to be an intraspecifically polymorphic character of this species...|$|E
40|$|The maned sloth Bradypus torquatus (Pilosa, <b>Bradypodidae)</b> is {{endemic to}} a small area in the Atlantic Forest of coastal Brazil. It has been listed as a {{threatened}} species because of its restricted geographic range, habitat loss and fragmentation, and declining populations. The major objectives {{of this study were}} to estimate its potential geographic distribution, the climatic conditions across its distributional range, and to identify suitable areas and potential species strongholds. We developed a model of habitat suitability for the maned sloth using two methods, Maxent and Mahalanobis Distance, based on 42 occurrence points. We evaluated environmental variable importance and the predictive ability of the generated distribution models. Our results suggest that the species distribution could be strongly influenced by environmental factors, mainly temperature seasonality. The modeled distribution of the maned sloth included known areas of occurrence in the Atlantic Forest (Sergipe, Bahia, Espı́rito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro), but did not match the observed distributional gaps in northern Rio de Janeiro, northern Espı́rito Santo or southern Bahia. Rather, the model showed that these areas are climatically suitable for the maned sloth, and thus suggests that factors other than climate might be responsible for the absence of species. Suitable areas for maned sloth were located mainly in the mountainous region of central Rio de Janeiro throughout Espı́rito Santo and to the coastal region of southern Bahia. We indicate 17 stronghold areas and recommended survey area...|$|E
40|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{biological diversity}} of tropical forests harbors a rich chemical diversity with enormous {{potential as a}} source of novel bioactive compounds. Of particular interest are new environments for microbial discovery. Sloths [...] arboreal mammals commonly found in the lowland forests of Panama [...] carry a wide variety of micro- and macro-organisms on their coarse outer hair. Here we report {{for the first time the}} isolation of diverse and bioactive strains of fungi from sloth hair, and their taxonomic placement. Eighty-four isolates of fungi were obtained in culture from the surface of hair that was collected from living three-toed sloths (Bradypus variegatus, <b>Bradypodidae)</b> in Soberanía National Park, Republic of Panama. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a diverse group of Ascomycota belonging to 28 distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs), several of which are divergent from previously known taxa. Seventy-four isolates were cultivated in liquid broth and crude extracts were tested for bioactivity in vitro. We found a broad range of activities against strains of the parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), and against the human breast cancer cell line MCF- 7. Fifty fungal extracts were tested for antibacterial activity in a new antibiotic profile screen called BioMAP; of these, 20 were active against at least one bacterial strain, and one had an unusual pattern of bioactivity against Gram-negative bacteria that suggests a potentially new mode of action. Together our results reveal the importance of exploring novel environments for bioactive fungi, and demonstrate for the first time the taxonomic composition and bioactivity of fungi from sloth hair...|$|E
