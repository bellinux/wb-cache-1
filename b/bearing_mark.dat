50|$|Magnetic {{deviation}} is {{the angle}} from a given magnetic bearing to the related <b>bearing</b> <b>mark</b> of the compass. Deviation is positive if a compass <b>bearing</b> <b>mark</b> (e.g., compass north) is {{right of the}} related magnetic bearing (e.g., magnetic north) and vice versa. For example, if the boat is aligned to magnetic north and the compass' north mark points 3° more east, deviation is +3°. Deviation varies for every compass in the same location and depends on such factors as the magnetic field of the vessel, wristwatches, etc. The value also varies depending on {{the orientation of the}} boat. Magnets and/or iron masses can correct for deviation, so that a particular compass accurately displays magnetic bearings. More commonly, however, a correction card lists errors for the compass, which can then be compensated for arithmetically. Deviation must be added to compass bearing to obtain magnetic bearing.|$|E

50|$|The United Nations {{increased}} the penalties for sedition and collusion with Yahweh again, this time banning followers of Yahweh {{from engaging in}} commerce or owning property. It was made illegal to buy anything from or sell anything to anyone not <b>bearing</b> the <b>mark</b> of Communion. Properties owned by those not <b>bearing</b> the <b>mark</b> were confiscated by the government, and residents not <b>bearing</b> the <b>mark,</b> evicted. Capital punishment was extended toward anyone showing {{an active role in}} the subversive behavior against Humankind and the New Age. Decker, by virtue of his position within the United Nations, and by virtue of very few people knowing where he was, remained undisturbed in his home in Maryland. Policemen issuing eviction notices bypassed Decker's home believing that there's no way that Decker Hawthorne - THE Decker Hawthorne - would not have received the Communion, especially when record-keeping errors were not uncommon.|$|R

The younger had a more attractive face, for, though <b>bearing</b> <b>marks</b> of dissipation, it betrayed a generous, ardent nature, proud and wilful, yet lovable {{in spite of all}} defects.

50|$|On 19 November 2012, a dead wolf {{was found}} in the {{national}} park area. After thorough DNA-tests it was finally confirmed that there was a 100% match with a wolfpack in the Lausitz-region in Sachsen, Germany. The wolf was four years old and it is believed that it traversed the 850 km to Thy National Park. Wolves have been exterminated in Denmark for 200 years. In the beginning of 2013 a wolf-like creature was observed in Thy and a carcass <b>bearing</b> <b>marks</b> associated with a wolf-kill was found on 18 February. On 1 March 2013, the Minister of the Environment Ida Auken, initiated on this background the formulation of a Danish action plan concerning wolves.|$|R
