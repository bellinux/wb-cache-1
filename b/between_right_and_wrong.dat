Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Phillip Resnick testified that Dahmer {{did not suffer}} from primary necrophilia because he preferred live sexual partners as evidenced by his efforts to create unresistant, submissive sexual partners devoid of rational thought and to whose needs {{he did not have}} to cater. Another prosecution expert to testify, Dr. Fred Fosdel, testified to his belief that Dahmer was without mental disease or defect at the time he committed the murders. He described Dahmer as a calculating and cunning individual, able to differentiate <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> with the ability to control his actions. Although Fosdel did state his belief that Dahmer suffered from paraphilia, his conclusion was that Dahmer was not a sadist.|$|E

The family was living in crowded lodgings at the time, and Straffen's mother had no time to help, so the probation officer took the boy to a psychiatrist. As a result, Straffen was certified as a mental defective under the Mental Deficiency Act 1927. A report was compiled on him in 1940 which gave his Intelligence Quotient as 58 and placed his mental age at six.

Essay writing is {{one part of}} the national test in the school subject Swedish. Here the student gets the opportunity to demonstrate that it is able to follow instructions and produce a coherent text. The examinator's task hereby becomes a troublesome process with subtle distinctions <b>between</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrongs.</b> This quantitative study consists of an investigation of the significance of length in students’ texts, i. e. text length, sentence length and word length. The aim is to collate the texts grade with these three aspects of length and also compare feminine and masculine language features. 17 student texts from the 2011 national test in Swedish for students aged 15, written by nine girls and eight boys from the grade levels not achieving the goals, satisfactory and very well satisfactory, form the basis for the study. These are three grade levels in a scale of four, where the second highest has been omitted. The results indicate that {{the answer to the question}} in the title is yes and furthermore that boys and girls use the length variable in different ways. For instance, boys tend to produce shorter texts with more longer words. There is also a slight correlation between short sentences and high grades. Finally, it seems to be of the highest concern to write a longer text if you want to avoid the lowest grade...|$|R

Churches of Christ hold the view that humans of accountable age are lost because they have committed sins. These lost souls can be redeemed because Jesus Christ, the Son of God, offered Himself as the atoning sacrifice. Children too young to understand right from wrong and make a conscious choice between the two, are believed to be innocent of sin.

Father John also has an unorthodox view of homosexuality compared to the normal views of the church.

For example, Villani described the story of Count Ugolini of Pisa, who at the height of attaining his ill-gotten wealth and power was overthrown and eventually starved to death along with his sons. Green writes that this story in the Cronica bears a resemblance to the ancient Greek story of Polycrates and his ring in the work of Herodotus. However, Green notes that Villani's [...] "cautionary tales" [...] disembarked from the Classical Greek tradition of the arrogant and haughty rich falling from fortune due to the Greek belief in equalizing forces determining one's unavoidable fate, which Green calls [...] "excessive good fortune having to be balanced by an appropriate measure of sorrow." [...] Villani's adherence to Medieval Christianity allowed him to suggest retribution was delivered because of sin and insult to God. He stressed that those who gained prestige would fall prey to pride; confidence in their position would then lead them to sin, and sin would bring on a stage of decline. Villani wrote: ...|$|E

But it is also possible that it took three days to cover all its neighborhoods by walking, which would match the size of ancient Nineveh. The ruins of Kouyunjik, Nimrud, Karamles and Khorsabad form the four corners of an irregular quadrangle. The ruins of Nineveh, with the whole area included within the parallelogram they form by lines drawn from the one to the other, are generally regarded as consisting of these four sites. The Book of Jonah depicts Nineveh as a wicked city worthy of destruction. God sent Jonah to preach to the Ninevites of their coming destruction, and they fasted and repented because of this. As a result, God spared the city; when Jonah protests against this, God states He is showing mercy for the population who are ignorant of the difference <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong</b> ("who cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand" [...] ) and mercy for the animals in the city.|$|E
2500|$|Also, the [...] "relationship between mental {{retardation}} and the penological purposes {{served by the}} death penalty" [...] justifies a conclusion that executing the mentally retarded is {{cruel and unusual punishment}} that the Eighth Amendment should forbid. In other words, unless it can be shown that executing the mentally retarded promotes the goals of retribution and deterrence, doing so is nothing more than [...] "purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering", making the death penalty cruel and unusual in those cases. Being mentally retarded means that a person not only has substandard intellectual functioning but also significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction. These deficiencies typically manifest before the age of eighteen. Although they can know the difference <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong,</b> these deficiencies mean they have a lesser ability to learn from experience, engage in logical reasoning, and understand the reactions of others. This means that inflicting the death penalty on one mentally retarded individual is less likely to deter other mentally retarded individuals from committing crimes. As for retribution, society's interest in seeing that a criminal get his [...] "just desserts" [...] means that the death penalty must be confined to the [...] "most serious" [...] of murders, not simply the average murder. The goal of retribution is not served by imposing the death penalty on {{a group of people who}} have a significantly lesser capacity to understand why they are being executed.|$|E

Wertham said that Fish believed that similarly [...] "sacrificing" [...] a boy would be penance for his own sins and that even if the act itself was wrong, angels would prevent it if God did not approve. Fish attempted the sacrifice once before but was thwarted when a car drove past. Edward Budd was the next intended victim, but {{he turned out to be}} larger than expected so he settled on Grace. Although he knew Grace was female, it is believed that Fish perceived her as a boy. Wertham then detailed Fish's cannibalism, which in his mind he associated with communion. The last question Dempsey asked Wertham was 15,000 words long, detailed Fish's life and ended with asking how the doctor considered his mental condition based on this life. Wertham simply answered [...] "He is insane". Gallagher cross-examined Wertham on whether Fish knew the difference <b>between</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>wrong.</b> He responded that he did know but that it was a perverted knowledge based on his opinions of sin, atonement and religion and thus was an [...] "insane knowledge".
