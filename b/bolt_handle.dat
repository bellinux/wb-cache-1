5|$|The MP 40 submachine {{guns are}} open-bolt, blowback-operated {{automatic}} arms. The only mode of fire was fully automatic, but {{the relatively low}} rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls. The bolt features a telescoping return spring guide {{which serves as a}} pneumatic recoil buffer. The cocking handle was permanently attached to the bolt on early MP 38s, but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s, the <b>bolt</b> <b>handle</b> was made as a separate part. It also served as a safety by pushing the head of handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locked the bolt either in the cocked (rear) or uncocked (forward) position. The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop, used to hold the bolt in forward position.|$|E

It has a non-rotating bolt (the part of the action that seals the rear end of the barrel) locked by a rotating <b>bolt</b> <b>handle,</b> and reputedly a smooth action. However, this action is not considered strong enough to fire modern ammunition, since the only locking {{is provided by the}} rotating <b>bolt</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} m/1938 rifles (Type I) {{were converted}} m/1896 rifles with barrels cut down by 5.5" [...] (139mm) {{and almost always}} with the original straight <b>bolt</b> <b>handles.</b> These rifles are often referred to by collectors as [...] "m/96-38" [...] rifles, {{but there was never}} an official designation for this conversion. [...] The majority of purpose-built m/1938s (Type II) had turned-down <b>bolt</b> <b>handles</b> and were manufactured by Husqvarna Vapenfabriks AB, with production ending in 1944. However, the Swedish military made no distinction in service between the two types.|$|R

2500|$|Along {{with the}} M1885 Remington-Lee and the M1892 Springfield, the M1895 Lee {{was one of}} the first {{infantry}} weapons adopted by U.S. forces to be equipped with a repeating action. [...] To operate the straight-pull mechanism, the operating handle is first pulled up at an angle to disengage the bolt and its wedge lock, then pulled sharply to the rear to extract and eject the spent case. [...] Pushing forward on the <b>bolt</b> <b>handle</b> strips a round from the magazine; as the bolt is slammed home, the bolt's wedge lock seats into place, the firing pin is cocked, and the fresh cartridge is seated in the chamber. [...] Once the M1895 is cocked, the rifle's bolt cannot be retracted unless the bolt-release lever is pushed downward. [...] This prevents opening of the action caused by an inadvertent bump or contact to the <b>bolt</b> <b>handle.</b> [...] The rifle has a safety located on the top of the receiver, which is released by pushing down with the thumb on the safety button.|$|E
5000|$|The {{switchboard}} {{built by}} Coy was, {{according to one}} source, constructed of [...] "carriage <b>bolts,</b> <b>handles</b> from teapot lids and bustle wire."

While the switchboard could connect as many as sixty-four customers, only two conversations could be handled simultaneously and six connections {{had to be made}} for each call.|$|R
50|$|The Gewehr 88 {{was also}} {{sometimes}} made into very elegant sporting rifles by gunsmiths in Germany. Examples of these usually show first-class workmanship and special {{features such as}} folding sights and altered <b>bolt</b> <b>handles.</b> Some Karabiner 88 carbines {{are known to have}} been produced in 7×57mm Mauser instead of the usual M/88 or the 7.92×57mm Mauser chambering. These were likely intended for sale in South America, where use of the 7×57mm cartridge was widespread, but no military adopted it in this caliber. All known 7×57mm Karabiner 88s were produced by Haenel.|$|R
50|$|The new rifle {{features}} a heavy-taper stainless steel barrel, a detachable 10-round double-stack box magazine, custom iron sights calibrated from 100-600 meters, a laminated wooden stock, stainless steel construction with extra corrosion resistant coatings, and enlarged trigger guards and <b>bolt</b> <b>handles</b> {{so they can}} be used by rangers without requiring them to remove their gloves. The barrel, bolt and receiver will be made by Colt Canada under licence from SAKO. In addition to the rifle, the accessories package will include a custom-molded Pelican hard transport case, plus a soft transport case (outfitted with sling, extra magazines, a trigger lock and custom cleaning kit). Both hard case and soft case and rifle butt stock feature the Canadian Ranger badge.|$|R
2500|$|The Lee–Enfield rifle {{was derived}} from the earlier Lee–Metford, a {{mechanically}} similar black-powder rifle, which combined James Paris Lee's rear-locking bolt system with a barrel featuring rifling designed by William Ellis Metford. The Lee action cocked the striker on the closing stroke of the bolt, making the initial opening much faster and easier compared to the [...] "cock on opening" [...] (i.e., the firing pin cocks upon opening the bolt) of the Mauser Gewehr 98 design. The bolt has a relatively short bolt throw and features rear-mounted lugs and the bolt operating handle places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger at a favorable ergonomic position close to the operator's hand. The action features helical locking surfaces (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final head space is not achieved until the <b>bolt</b> <b>handle</b> is turned down all the way. The British probably used helical locking lugs to allow for chambering imperfect or dirty ammunition and that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The rifle was also equipped with a detachable sheet-steel, 10-round, double-column magazine, a very modern development in its day. Originally, the concept of a detachable magazine was opposed in some British Army circles, as some feared that the private soldier might be likely to lose the magazine during field campaigns. Early models of the Lee–Metford and Lee–Enfield even used a short length of chain to secure the magazine to the rifle. To further facilitate rapid aimed fire the rifle can be cycled by most rifleman without loss of sight picture.|$|E

40|$|Roof bolting {{typically}} {{follows the}} extraction of a commodity {{to help keep the}} roof from collapsing. During 2004 to 2013, roof bolter operators had the highest number of machinery-related injuries, accounting for 64. 7 percent, at underground coal mines. This paper analyzes U. S. roof bolter fatal and nonfatal lost-time injury data at underground work locations for all commodities from 2004 through 2013 and determines risk indices for six roof bolting tasks. For fatal and nonfatal incidences combined, the roof bolting tasks in order of the highest to lowest risk index were <b>bolting,</b> <b>handling</b> of materials, setting the temporary roof support (TRS), drilling, tramming, and traversing. For fatalities, the roof bolting tasks in order of the highest to lowest risk index were handling of materials, setting the TRS, bolting, drilling, traversing, and tramming. Age was found to be a significant factor. Severity of injury, indicated by days lost, was found to increase with increasing age as well as with increasing experience, largely due to the confounding of age and experience. The operation of the roof bolting machine used in underground mining should be a research priority given the high frequency and severity of incidents. The results also suggest that temporal factors may exist, so additional research is warranted to better understand these factors and potentially develop interventions. This research provides a data-driven foundation from which future research can be conducted for safety interventions to reduce the frequency and severity of incidences involving the roof bolter activities of <b>bolting,</b> <b>handling</b> of materials, and setting the TRS.

50|$|Field {{use of the}} K98a rifles {{showed that}} as an {{infantry}} weapon, and not a weapon for auxiliary or special troops as originally purposed, the design was inadequate. The greatest flaw was the weak bayonet mount (the bayonet lug would break off when hitting hard objects). The K98a also used a small-ring Mauser action, which complicated production and parts interchangeability. Following the postwar shift to large-ring carbines with 600 mm barrels and Gewehr 98-style bayonet lug/muzzle lengths, such as the Czech vz. 24, {{the decision was made}} to develop an intermediate model rifle for the Polish Army. The design was finalized in 1929. The new wz.29 rifle was based on the old wz.98 rifle, but with a shortened stock and barrel, stronger alloys for the receiver and barrel, a reinforced chamber, and increased dimensional tolerance in the action, allowing for easy interchangeability of parts. There were two versions of the rifle: Infantry models had straight <b>bolt</b> <b>handles,</b> while cavalry models had curved handles. Since both variations used the same stock, infantry models had a cutout in the stock for the curved handle.|$|R

5000|$|The Carbine {{has some}} unique design features. The {{action is a}} simple {{blowback}} design, which requires a fairly massive <b>bolt</b> to <b>handle</b> the pressure of 9mm and [...]40 S&W. To prevent the gun from being too unbalanced by the large bolt, the bolt consists of two parts; {{the main body of}} the bolt is fairly light and located in the receiver, while the other part is just a weight located under the forend of the carbine. These two parts are held together by strong, rigid steel bars. The combined mass serves to hold the breech safely closed during firing, while keeping the center of gravity forward, so the gun handles well.|$|R

5000|$|The Model 1895 {{was also}} {{deployed}} to republic of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (more {{commonly known as}} “Transvaal”) by DWM shortly after the Jameson Raid in December 1895 {{to deal with the}} shortage of modern magazine fed rifles for the state army. Roughly 50,000 Mauser rifles were ordered but only 37,000 were delivered because DWM diverted them to fulfill their contract with the Chilean army. Due to many rifles being diverted to Chile, many of the rifles there have the inscription “O.V.S” (Oranje Vrij Staat), Orange Free State. The Model 1895 brought to the “Transvaal” was also known as [...] "Boer Model" [...] Mauser [...] and were marked “O.V.S” (Oranje Vrij Staat) just above the serial number accompanied by MOD.MAUSER and the date of the manufacturer. Due to this, a misunderstanding occurred regarding the identification between the Model 1896 and Model 1897. At the time, an Afrikaans farmer (Also known as a Boer) could purchase a Mauser Model 1895 at a price of £3, another variant known in Afrikaans as Plezier Mauser was sold slightly above cost by the respective governments and private dealers for sport and private use. These rifles varied in strock style, barrel, sight lines and ornamentation. Some of the last rifles delivered by DWM were equipped with turned down <b>bolt</b> <b>handles</b> which made them suitable for the South African farmers on horseback. Work on the manufacturing of the Mauser Model 1895 was halted in 1899 by the Second Boer War.|$|R
