Here we describe the presence of ABV in a parrot with PDD {{as well as in}} clinically normal birds exposed to birds with PDD.

Viremia was observed in a PDD affected bird whereas a restriction of ABV to nerve tissue was found in the not PDD affected bird. Healthy birds from the same aviary as the affected birds were also found to harbour the virus; 19 / 59 (32. 2 %) tested positive for ABV RNA in cloacal swabs, providing the first evidence of ABV in clinically healthy birds. In contrast, 39 birds from the same geographic area, but from two different aviaries without PDD cases in recent years, had negative cloacal swabs.

Borna disease virus (BDV) is the causative agent of Borna disease, a meningoencephalitis of horses and sheep in central Europe (1). As the prototype and only known {{member of the family}} Bornaviridae in the order Mononegavirales (nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses), BDV is atypical in its nuclear localization of transcription, alternative splicing, and differential use of initiation and termination signals. Sequence analysis of isolates obtained from various species over several decades has shown remarkable sequence conservation; only 2 genotypes are known. The virus is highly neurotropic and infects the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems. Although ungulates remain the best known natural host, the introduction of sensitive molecular and serologic assays enabled by subtractive cloning of the BDV genome facilitated surveys that indicated wider geographic and species distribution (1). Experimental infections are described {{in a wide variety of}} vertebrates including chickens, quails, rats, rabbits, cats, shrews, and nonhuman primates; manifestations of disease range from fatal meningoencephalitis to subtle behavioral alterations or asymptomatic persistent infection (2).

40|$|There {{are many}} {{pathogens}} that infect birds and perhaps many more that researchers {{have not yet}} identified. Of all potential pathogens, the research presented in this manuscript focuses on two avian RNA viruses. First, a serodiagnostic test for newly described Avian <b>Borna</b> <b>Virus</b> (ABV), which has been recently identified as the etiological agent of Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD), was developed. PDD is a deadly disease which affects many birds, but to this point, has mainly been a concern of psittacines. The need for a diagnostic test is imperative. An antigen associated with PDD was identified from the brains of affected birds by use of the Western blot assay. This antigen was subsequently purified using various protein purification protocols, including a modification of reverse-phase chromatography. The antigen was then identified as the ABV nucleoprotein according to tandem mass spectroscopy analysis and protein database search. A serodiagnostic assay was developed and standardized using infected cell culture as an antigen source. Over 100 avian serum samples were submitted by veterinarians to test {{for the presence of}} antibodies against ABV nucleoprotein. This serodiagnostic assay was found to have 90 % sensitivity and 82 % specificity for the diagnosis of ABV in infected birds. Second, the ability of a carbohydrate epitope to enhance the humoral immune response to an influenza vaccine was tested in chickens. Influenza is a serious infection that causes 36, 000 deaths annually in the United States. The need for a more efficacious is addressed by incorporating a carbohydrate antigen targeted by natural antibodies that are produced by chickens as well as humans. Therefore, chickens may be a suitable animal model to test this hypothesis. Influenza vaccines with alpha-gal antigen are prepared from cell culture. The antigen is then enzymatically removed from some vaccines {{and the nature of the}} ensuing humoral immune response to these vaccines in chickens is attempted. Though ABV is not known to be zoonotic at this time, zoonotic infections pose the highest risk as new and emerging infectious diseases in the human population. The following research contains applications relative to challenges faced by researchers and clinicians in infectious disease containment...|$|E
40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} that {{are caused by}} numerous pathogenic microorganisms – bacteria, viruses, protozoa or fungi – can be transmitted from patients or carriers to healthy people or animals. A large group of infectious disease is caused by pathogens of animal infections – zoonoses. The issue of zoonoses is of great significance in human pathology and requires comprehensive study. This is of particular relevance to Ukraine, as the question of prevalence, level within the population and threats to human life and health from zoonoses, though highly important, has remained insufficiently studied. Information about many of these pathogens is absent in the existing scientific literature accessible in Ukraine – both veterinary and medical. This applies, in particular, to a causative agent of viral zoonoses the Borna disease virus or Bornavirus. For this purpose, {{an analysis of the}} literature concerning the role of the Bornavirus in the pathology of animals and humans was conducted. It is well known {{that a large number of}} pathogens of animal infections (zoonoses), including viral, pose a potential threat to human health. Among these potential threats is the Borna disease virus belonging to the family of Bornaviridae, order Mononegavirales. This order includes representatives of deadly human diseases like rabies (family Rhabdoviridae), Ebola virus (family Filoviridae) and Nipah virus (family Paramyxoviridae). <b>Borna</b> <b>virus</b> disease affects mainly mammals, but can infect birds and even reptiles (Aspid bornavirus). It is established that Bornaviruses have a wide range of natural hosts (horses, sheeps, cats, bats and various birds), including domestic animals, which poses a potential threat to human health. This is evidenced by numerous, although contradictory, research into the role of the Borna disease virus in human pathologies such as schizophrenia, depression, prolonged fatigue syndrome, multiple sclerosis and others. Analysis of the literature clearly shows the important role of the Borna disease virus in a variety of mental and behavioural changes in animals, both wild and domestic. However, the large amount of contradictory data and studies cannot yet provide a clear picture of the role of this virus in human pathology. On the one hand, there are clear data of the presence of RNA of the Bourna disease virus and antibodies to it in patients with psychoneurotic changes. On the other, there is no clear understanding of the infectivity of the virus in humans and its transmission from animals to humans and from person to person.

40|$|Borna-Disease-Virus (BDV) is a {{single-stranded}} RNA virus with neurotropism, causing persistent {{infection of}} {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) in mammals. This leads to different neurological sign like blindness, learning or movement disorders, memory disturbances, paralysis, hypokinesias, anorexia, excitations, colic and salivation, psychiatric disorders, dementia and behavioral abnormalities, which can all be attributed to diseases of the limbic system. Borna-virus-infections have been described {{in a wide range of}} species. By now, nearly all animal species can be infected experimentally (Stitz et al. 1981; Ludwig et al. 1988; Rott und Becht 1995). The clinical signs of Borna-disease are not caused by the virus itself, but rather by the host`s immune response. Transmission of BDV probably occurs via upper airway mucosa, the pharynx or olfactory mucosa. Regarding a virus reservoir, an infection of small rodents cannot be ruled out and the bicolored white-toothed shrew (Crocidura leucodon) has been discussed as natural reservoir host (Kersten 2015). Concerning the virus transmission to humans no consentaneous statement could be made until 2015, when representatives of the Borna-virus family named „Variegated Squirrel <b>Borna</b> <b>Virus</b> 1 “ (VSBV- 1), found in variegated squirrels (Sciurus variegatoides) were able to infect humans (Hoffmann 2015). Local BDV strains differ in their protein pattern. Based on the N-protein gene it was proven, that viruses isolated from horses of outbreaks in different locations had a much higher genetic variability of the N-protein gene with increasing spatial separation. This supports the hypothesis that infections amongst susceptible species are maintained by enzootic, geographically differentiates virus strains. The virus is able to rapidly adapt to other species (Dietz 2006). The BDV can be found in the human genome and replicates in affected nuclei, but so far the significance of the detection of BDV in human DNA remains unclear (Tomonaga 2002). Post mortem diagnostic tests are indisputable, but the intra vitam diagnosis raises difficulties and permits not prognostic statement in clinically healthy horses. Diagnostic test necessitate a high sensitivity as only a low antibody titer is generated by a BDV infection, which results in a low specificity of the test (Staeheli et al. 2000). Avian borna viruses (ABV), which are linked to diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system of psittacides (Hankavuori et al. 2008; Kistler et al. 2008), produce neurological signs like epileptic episodes, ataxia, paresis, tremor and head tilt. Meanwhile they are regarded as causative agent of the neuropathic proventricular dilatation disease (PDD) (Gancz et al. 2010; Hoppes et al. 2010; Payne et al. 2011). Contrast enhanced radiography proving PDD is not sufficient for a definite diagnosis (Degernes et al. 1996). So far PCRs (Hankavuori et al. 2008; Kistler et al. 2008; Weissenböck et al. 2009 b), Western blot (Villanueva et al. 2010), ELISA (De Kloet und Dorrestein 2009) and immunofluorescent testing do not provide a reliable diagnostic test, for which reason a combination of serological tests and PCR is recommended (Herzog et al. 2010). Diseases animals are treated symptomatically. It is assumed that ABV is transmitted via a faecal-oral route (De Kloet und Dorrestein 2009), because the virus colonizes the entire gastrointestinal tract. However, BDV has not been found in faeces of mammals yet (Sauder und Staeheli 2003), only in faeces of birds (Malkinson et al. 1995). The transmission of VSBV- 1 remains uncertain, but a droplet infection is suspected. For detection of VSBV- 1 virus analogue analyses, molecular biological detection methods, serological tests with IFT and ELISA as well as intra vitam tests via oral or blood sample have been used. In doing so, the intra vitam tests matched the post mortem tests to 100 % (Kersten 2015) ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that many kinds of {{diseases}} are caused by viruses having RNA as their genetic materials. In general, RNA viruses evolve by evolutionary factors including mutation and selection. Selection against RNA viruses is mainly caused by the interaction with the host species, because RNA viruses can survive only as parasites of the host species. Therefore, it is of particular importance to investigate the interactions between RNA viruses and the host for studying the evolution of RNA viruses. In this thesis, l focused on the following three interacting features with the host; 1) modes of viral infection to the host, 2) viral adaptation to a single host and 3) exchanging genomic regions between RNA viruses and the host. In chapter 1, first, I defined the virus as an organism that could survive and grow only in the living cell, and that contained a protein coat surrounding a nucleic acid core but having no semi permeable membrane. In addition to the definitions, I outlined the taxonomy and evolutionary mechanisms of RNA viruses. In chapter 2, I estimated the rates of synonymous substitution for 46 species of RNA viruses and found {{a large amount of}} variation in the rates (the difference in the 3 rd orders of magnitude). On the other hand, through constancy in the rate of replication error among RNA viruses examined, I concluded that the main factor for the variation of the substitution rates was the differences in the replication frequency. This is because we can assume that the rate of synonymous substitution is determined by the rate of replication error and the replication frequency. Moreover, I examined relationships between the rates of synonymous substitution and several modes of viral infections to the host including the transmission modes. The results obtained indicate that the rate of synonymous substitution was strongly related to the difference in the modes of viral infection to the host. The reason was speculated as that the modes of viral infection to the host altered the replication frequency. In chapter 3, using porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus(PRRSV) whose synonymous substitution rate was the highest among the 46 species of RNA viruses, I conducted evolutionary analyses {{in order to understand the}} evolutionary process of PRRSV. The virus is a recently emerged pathogen in domesticated swines. Epidemiological data suggest that the divergence time of PRRSV is about 15 years ago. For confirming the rapidness of the synonymous substitution rate in PRRSV, I first estimated the divergence time of PRRSV by molecular evolutionary analysis, and compared it with that inferred from the epidemiological data. As a result, the divergence time estimated by the evolutionary analysis well corresponded to that estimated by the epidemiological data. This correspondence ensured the rapidness of the rate in PRRSV Second, I studied the envelope regions as an important element for viral adaptation to the host. In particular, positively selected sites were detected in the envelope gene by my computer analysis. Interestingly, the sites were located not only in the regions attacked by the host immune system but also in the transmembrane regions including a signal peptide. The positively selected sites in the transmembrane regions were considered to be irrelevant for escaping the immune system, because no amino acid substitutions were observed in the transmembrane regions of the sequences isolated from piglets that were experimentally infected by PRRSV. In other words, the transmembrane regions and the signal peptide are thought to be specific to a given membrane. Therefore, l think that the positively selected sites of the membrane regions are important not for the viral adaptation to the host immune system but for the viral attachment to the membrane of the new host cell, because PRRSV emerged recently as mentioned above. In chapter 4, I searched for eukaryotic genomic regions homologous to RNA viruses to find how often the exchange of a genomic sequence has occurred between RNA viruses including retro and non-retro viruses and 6 eukaryotic genomes such as Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The evolutionary origin of the homologous regions was studied by phylogenetic analysis. For the non-retrovirus RNA viruses, I obtained two major results: First, a part of the <b>Borna</b> <b>virus</b> genome (nucleocapsid protein gene) was shown for the first time to be derived from mammalian genomes. Second, the 6 eukaryotic genomes did not have any part of the virus genome. In the case of the retroviruses and the two mammalian species, Homo sapiens and Mus musculus, I obtained four results. First, retrovirus-like regions occupied about 0. 1 % of each of the whole genomes of the two species. Second, physical maps indicating the locations of the retrovirus-like regions were constructed for both genomes. Third, the retrovirus-like regions were not randomly distributed in both complete genomes at a significant level (P between the GC content of retrovirus-like regions and that of the flanking regions for both species. From these results, I have concluded that retroviruses have been integrated into the host genome where the GC content was similar to each other. The present study will give a insight not only into the evolutionary origin and process of RNA viruses but also the interacting features between RNA viruses and their hosts...|$|E
