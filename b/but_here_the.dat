25|$|The {{sarcophagus}} measures 1.53m {{in height}} and {{is made from}} Proconnesian marble, a medium characterized by dark gray stripes and a medium to coarse grain. It is decorated in a very high relief with many elements of the composition cut completely free of the background. Overlapping figures entirely fill the image space, allowing no room to depict a background. In many battle sarcophagi the side panels show more tranquil scenes, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>the</b> battle continues round both sides.|$|E
25|$|The second painting, Youth, {{shows the}} same rich, green landscape, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>the</b> view widens {{as does the}} voyager's experience. Now the youth grabs the tiller firmly as the angel watches and waves from the shore, {{allowing}} him to take control. The boy's enthusiasm and energy is evident in his forward-thrusting pose and billowing clothes. In the distance, a ghostly castle hovers in the sky, a white and shimmering beacon that represents the ambitions and dreams of man.|$|E
25|$|In , Jesus dines at {{the home}} of a Pharisee named Simon, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>the</b> {{locality}} is not given. A woman of the city, who was a sinner anoints his feet, and again her name is not given. Many scholars regard this as the same incident as described in Matthew 26 and Mark 14, again despite some discrepancies. Some authorities identify this person as Mary Magdalene, and some the event as that in John 12, again with some discrepancies.|$|E

25|$|Vedel {{directed}} Cassagne's legion, {{supported by}} Boussard's dragoons, against the Irish {{position on the}} knoll. While Cassagne grappled the Irish, Boussard raced around the enemy flank and rear, trampled part of Coussigny's militia regiment, and enveloped the knoll. Their guns lost, the Irish battalion surrendered, and Vedel's men took the knoll and 1,500 prisoners. Meanwhile, Colonel Roche's column struck the Spanish strongpoint at San Cristóbal, possession of which was necessary if Vedel hoped to turn Coupigny and force open a path to Dupont. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>the</b> Spanish regulars under Colonel Francisco Soler held their line obstinately and all attacks failed.|$|E

Those inside the house would recite or sing special verses, to be answered by the revelers outside.|$|E
25|$|Chrétien de Troyes tells {{yet another}} version of Guinevere's abduction, this time by Meleagant (whose name is {{possibly}} derived from Melwas) in Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart. The abduction sequence is largely a reworking of that recorded in Caradoc's work, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>the</b> queen's rescuer is not Arthur (or Yder) but Lancelot, whose adultery with the queen is dealt with {{for the first time}} in this poem. It has been suggested that Chrétien invented their affair to supply Guinevere with a courtly extramarital lover. Mordred could not be used as his reputation was beyond saving, and Yder had been forgotten entirely.|$|E

25|$|Normal swing occurs mostly {{when the}} ball is fairly new. As it wears more, the {{aerodynamics}} of the asymmetry change and {{it is more difficult}} to extract a large amount of swing. When the ball becomes very old—around 40 or more overs old—it begins to swing towards the shine. This is known as reverse swing—meaning a natural outswinger will become an inswinger and vice versa. In essence, both sides have turbulent flow, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>the</b> seam causes the airflow to separate earlier on one side. The result is always a swing to the side with the later separation, so the swing is away from the seam.|$|E
25|$|In {{this moment}} the Hungarians right wing was {{attacked}} by the Herzinger brigade from Cseke, which swept away the Hungarian Dipold brigade, and pushed {{it back to the}} forest from Hölvény (outside of Nagysalló). <b>But</b> <b>here</b> <b>the</b> Bobich brigade stopped them, while the retreating Hungarian brigade also stopped and regrouped. Here these two brigades were taken over by Major General Richard Guyon (who was not supposed to participate in the battle, because he was designate as the new commander of the besieged troops of Komárom, just wanted to fight, and help his army to obtain the victory). The two Hungarian brigades under the lead of Guyon forced the Herzinger brigade to retreat.|$|E
25|$|Loretto, {{on behalf}} of all {{property}} owners so situated, sued Manhattan Teleprompter for trespass and—insofar as Teleprompter relied on § 828—a taking without just compensation, and requested damages and injunctive relief; the City of New York intervened in the case. The New York Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the statute and rendered summary judgment for Manhattan Teleprompter, finding that non-crossover installations constituted a taking for which just compensation is due, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>the</b> law served a legitimate public purpose there is no significant economic impact on expectations of investors, rejecting the theory that physical presence is per se a taking.

500|$|At room temperature, {{bromine trifluoride}} (BrF3) is a straw-coloured liquid. It may be formed by {{directly}} fluorinating bromine {{at room temperature}} and is purified through distillation. It reacts explosively with water and hydrocarbons, but is a less violent fluorinating reagent than chlorine trifluoride. It reacts vigorously with boron, carbon, silicon, arsenic, antimony, iodine, and sulfur to give fluorides, and also reacts with most metals and their oxides: as such, {{it is used to}} oxidise uranium to uranium hexafluoride in the nuclear industry. Refractory oxides tend to be only partially fluorinated, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>the</b> derivatives KBrF4 and BrF2SbF6 remain reactive. Bromine trifluoride is a useful nonaqueous ionising solvent, since it readily dissociates to form [...] and [...] and thus conducts electricity.|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the second}} season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a B+. The review stated that [...] "untangling this web of shifting allegiances and identities requires intense concentration. Hang on, though; the payoff's worth it". Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode an A, noting that it was [...] "X-Files in top form". He praised how the character of Samantha Mulder was presented, saying that [...] "In the seasons to come, {{we end up with}} enough Samantha's [...] to fill a clown-car, <b>but</b> <b>here,</b> <b>the</b> reveal is shocking, effective, and unsettling"; and also felt that the episode's flashforward cold open was particularly well-handled. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, wrote that [...] "Colony" [...] presents a moral dilemma for the characters, noting that [...] "on the surface Mulder's quest appears righteous, however, the results of his quest would suggest otherwise", and adding [...] "generally the ideology that focuses on a single life's (be that human or alien) importance is successful, whereas Mulder's ideology of finding the truth at all costs is not". Duchovny's portrayal of Fox Mulder in this episode has been cited {{as an example of the}} character's reversal of traditional gender roles—his openness and vulnerability when confronted with what he believes is his prodigal sister casts him [...] "in a pattern typically engendered as female." ...|$|E
