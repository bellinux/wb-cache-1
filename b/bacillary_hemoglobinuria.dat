5000|$|As part of {{his work}} for the new Stock Institute, in 1894 Pound proved that cattle ticks {{transmitted}} Redwater Disease (<b>Bacillary</b> <b>Hemoglobinuria),</b> which was causing heavy losses in Queensland cattle. He conducted the first inoculation studies into this disease in Australia and established a methodology and dosage that are still used worldwide. He trained stockowners in the techniques of collecting recovered blood, defibrillating it and using this vaccine to inoculate their stock. To facilitate this, he invented the [...] "Pound" [...] syringe and arranged {{for it to be}} manufactured. Backed by his lectures and published articles, this work made a major contribution to the success of Queensland's cattle industry. Pound's activities also included obtaining pathological specimens of various manifestations of diseases in stock and other domesticated animals, and items sent in by stock owners were added to the museum's collection. However, the primary object of the Institute in 1895 was to cultivate the pleuro-pneumonia virus for inoculating cattle. In 1897 administration of the Institute passed from the Colonial Secretary's Office to the Queensland Department of Agriculture, founded in 1887.|$|E

40|$|Two {{clinical}} syndromes of ruminants {{are caused}} by exo-toxemic infections with the Clostridium novyi group of bac-teria: black disease (BD) from C. novyi type 8 and <b>bacillary</b> <b>hemoglobinuria</b> (BH) from C. haemolyticum (also known as C. novyi type D). 1, 6 The pathogenesis of both BD and BH is generally believed to begin with ingestion of environmental organisms followed by seeding of liver Kupffer cells with spores. 13 These spores lie dormant until some insult to the liver (e. g., trauma, parasite migration, infarction) results {{in the formation of}} a localized anaerobic environment that al-lows germination of the spores. 5, 12 The vegetative forms of these bacteria produce alpha and beta toxin (C. n vyi type B) or beta toxin only (C. haemolyticum); the toxin(s), when absorbed systemically, cause the lesions and clinical signs of BD and BH, respectively. 8 The salient lesion in both disease...|$|E
40|$|Since <b>bacillary</b> <b>hemoglobinuria</b> was Lrst {{described}} as an entity in 191691 11 it has continued {{to be an important}} disease of cattle in areas of the western United States where it is enzootic 17 4. In 1926 the disease was defined when Clostridixm hemo. &zmz was recognized as the primary etiologic agent 21. The toxicity of the organism for cattle, sheep, rabbits, mice and guinea pigs has been well establishedl 3, and several investigations concerning its biochemicall 5 ~ 21, toxigenic 2, 61 8 and immunologic 3 ~ 179 22 aspects, and natural distribution'? 103 129 14, 20 have been made. The organism has been found in the livers of apparently normal cattle from areas where the disease is enzooticlg. Several general reviews of knowledge about the disease have been published 4, 169 18. Investigations on the disease have been hampered by an inability to simulate closely the naturally-occurring lesions. Early investigators demonstrated that toxic cultures of CI. hemobticum would produce peracute hemolytic crises in cattle, sheep, rabbits, and guinea pigs...|$|E
40|$|Clostridium haemolyticum is {{the causal}} agent of <b>bacillary</b> <b>hemoglobinuria</b> in cattle, goat, sheep, and ruminants. In this study, we report the first {{recorded}} human-infecting C. haemolyticum strain collected from an 18 -year-old woman diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. After failure of traditional techniques, only next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology {{in combination with}} bioinformatics, phylogenetic, and pathogenomics analyses revealed that our King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (KFSHRC) bacterial isolate belongs to C. haemolyticum species. KFSHRC isolate is composed of 1 chromosome and 4 plasmids. The total genome size {{is estimated to be}} 2. 7 [*]Mbp with a low GC content of 28. 02 %. Comparative pathogenomics analysis showed that C. haemolyticum KFSHRC isolate is a potential virulent pathogenic bacterium as it possesses the virulence factors necessary to establish an infection, acquire essential nutrients, resist antimicrobial agents, and tolerate hostile conditions both in the human host and in its surrounding environment. These factors are included in the main chromosome in addition to novel recombination of the plasmids, and they could be the reason for the incidence of that human infection. This work demonstrated the importance of using NGS in medical microbiology for pathogen identification. It also demonstrates the importance of sequencing more microbial samples and sharing this information in public databases to facilitate the identification of pathogenic microbes with better accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Clostridium botulinum (group III), Clostridium novyi and Clostridium haemolyticum are {{well-known}} pathogens causing animal botulism, gas gangrene/black disease, and <b>bacillary</b> <b>hemoglobinuria,</b> respectively. A close genetic relationship {{exists between}} the species, which {{has resulted in the}} collective term C. novyi sensu lato. The pathogenic traits in these species, e. g., the botulinum neurotoxin and the novyi alpha toxin, are mainly linked to a large plasmidome consisting of plasmids and circular prophages. The plasmidome of C. novyi sensu lato has so far been poorly characterized. In this study we explored the genomic relationship {{of a wide range of}} strains of C. novyi sensu lato with a special focus on the dynamics of the plasmidome. Twenty-four genomes were sequenced from strains selected to represent as much as possible the genetic diversity in C. novyi sensu lato. Sixty-one plasmids were identified in these genomes and 28 of them were completed. The genomic comparisons revealed four separate lineages, which did not strictly correlate with the species designations. The plasmids were categorized into 13 different plasmid groups on the basis of their similarity and conservation of plasmid replication or partitioning genes. The plasmid groups, lineages and species were to a large extent entwined because plasmids and toxin genes had moved across the lineage boundaries. This dynamic process appears to be primarily driven by phages. We here present a comprehensive characterization of the complex species group C. novyi sensu lato, explaining the intermixed genetic properties. This study also provides examples how the reorganization of the botulinum toxin and the novyi alpha toxin genes within the plasmidome has affected the pathogenesis of the strains...|$|E
40|$|Histopathological {{investigation}} {{was made of}} eleven cases affected with parturient hemoglobinemia. 1) Anatomically the outstanding changes found were an anemia, icterus, and edema in general. The blood was watery and dark. Especially the liver had undergone the most extensive changes. The livers of all cases were brownish-yellow or orange-yellow in colour due to fatty infiltration, sometimes slightly swollen and usually showed multiple necrotic patches. The spleen was usually congested on section of the pulp bulges and presented dark red, hemorrhagic appearance. Moreover, cloudiness of kidney, right side dilatation of the heart with subendo- and subepicardial hemorrhages, congestive edema of the lung, and enlargement and edema of the lymphnodes were found. A general diffuse catarrhal inflammation of the small intestine was recognized, but no changes were noted in the abomasum. The urinary bladder was always filled with dark red urine caused by presence of hemoglobin. 2) Histologically the most characteristic changes were observed in the liver; namely, necrotic and necrobiotic foci in the central area of liver lobules. Fatty infiltration was general throughout the lobules in {{almost all of the}} cases and endothelial cells took fat independently. A parenchymatous degeneration, such as hyaline drop degeneration and vacuolar degeneration were conspicuous in the kidney, especially fatty infiltrations were remarkable in pars recta of HENLE'S loop and {{in some parts of the}} convoluted tubules. In some stages, hemosiderin deposits were noted in the epithelial cells of kidney. Some cases showed glomerulonephritis serosa acuta and most cases contained serous exudation in the cavity of BOWMAN'S capsule. The spleen of all cases was abundant in blood content and pulp showed high hemosiderosis. Sometimes, fibrinthrombi were recognized in the sinus of the spleen. Subendo- and subepicardial hemorrhages and congestion of the heart were recognized and especially proliferated histiocytes in the interstitium were conspicuous. Some cases showed cardiac myodegeneration, and fine granular fat deposits in the muscular fiber. Moreover, enteritis catarrhalis, lymphadenitis catarrhalis and edema were found. 3) It was concluded that the main changes of this disease are parenchymatous degeneration and secondly circulatory disturbances in addition to proliferative changes which accompanied with reactive changes in R. E. S. 4) The authors differentiated the disease of piroplasmosis, bovine hematuria (Stallrot), <b>bacillary</b> <b>hemoglobinuria,</b> leptospirosis, bacillary pyelonephritis and puerperal sepsis from parturient hemoglobinemia. 5) It is considered that some relationship exists between milk fever, ketosis, aphosphorosis and parturient hemoglobinemia. 6) This disease is considered to be a sort which is produced by disturbances of metabolism...|$|E
