40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS), {{commonly referred}} to as Lou Gehrig’s disease is a progressive degenerative disorder that affects the nervous system, particularly the motor neurons. It may affect either spinal or <b>bulbar</b> <b>neurons,</b> which classify how symptoms present in the individual. Currently, the cause of ALS is unknown, although research indicates the possibility of genetic and environmental factors affecting its incidence.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{olfactory}} bulb of adult mice, new neurons are continually integrated into existing neuronal networks. Previous {{studies have demonstrated}} that exposure to a complex odor environment increases the incorporation of newborn <b>bulbar</b> <b>neurons</b> without modifying the proliferation rate. Whether this incorporation is transient or leads to the long-lasting presence of new neurons has not yet been answered. Because a transient increase of new neurons impacts olfactory information processing differently than a long-lasting increase, we conducted experiments to investigate the time course of survival and cell death of newly generated <b>bulbar</b> <b>neurons</b> following exposure to an enriched olfactory environment. Dividing cells were labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and were counted at several survival time points thereafter. Interestingly, whereas the number of surviving BrdU-labeled cells was elevated at the time when animals were withdrawn from their enriched housing, this number returned to control level 1 month later. Similarly, when olfactory memory was investigated, we found that the improvement of short-term memory, induced by enriched odor exposure, lasted less than 1 month. These findings indicate not only that the recruitment of newborn neurons closely followed the degree of environment complexity, but also that olfactory memory is tightly associated with the level of ongoing neurogenesis in the adult {{olfactory bulb}}...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} simultaneous single-neuron recordings {{from the}} hippocampus and the olfactory bulb of anesthetized, freely breathing rats. Odor response properties of neurons in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus were characterized as firing rate changes or respirationcoupled changes. A panel of five odors was used. The rats {{had not been}} exposed to the odors on the panel before the experiment. The olfactory bulb and hippocampal neurons responded to repeated odor presentations in two ways: first, by changes in firing rate, and second, by respiratory tuning changes. Approximately 60 % of <b>bulbar</b> <b>neurons,</b> 48 % of hippocampal CA 1 neurons, and 12 % of hippocampal CA 3 neurons showed statistically significant responses. None of the odor-responsive neurons in either the bulb or hippocampus responded to all of the odors on the panel. Repeated 10 sec odor stimuli presented at the intervals of 20, 30, 60, 110, and 160 sec were used to analyze the effect of the interval on odor response properties of the recorded <b>neurons.</b> <b>Bulbar</b> <b>neurons</b> were relatively nonselective for odor interval. Hippocampal neurons showed unexpected selectivity for the interval between repeated odor presentations. CA 1 and CA 3 neurons responded to only one to three of the intervals in the range. On the basis of these findings, we postulate that the hippocampus has the ability {{to keep track of the}} time elapsed between consecutive odor stimuli. This may act as a neuronal substrate for habituation and for complex tasks such as odor-guided navigation...|$|R
40|$|SummaryInhibitory local {{circuits}} in the {{olfactory bulb}} {{play a critical}} role in determining the firing patterns of output neurons. However, little is known about the circuitry in the major plexiform layers of the olfactory bulb that regulate this output. Here we report the first electrophysiological recordings from Blanes cells, large stellate-shaped interneurons located in the granule cell layer. We find that Blanes cells are GABAergic and generate large ICAN-mediated afterdepolarizations following bursts of action potentials. Using paired two-photon guided intracellular recordings, we show that Blanes cells have a presumptive axon and monosynaptically inhibit granule cells. Sensory axon stimulation evokes barrages of EPSPs in Blanes cells that trigger long epochs of persistent spiking; this firing mode was reset by hyperpolarizing membrane potential steps. Persistent firing in Blanes cells may represent a novel mechanism for encoding short-term olfactory information through modulation of tonic inhibitory synaptic input onto <b>bulbar</b> <b>neurons...</b>|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous, low-frequency voltage {{oscillations}} (LFOs) {{were observed}} in the neurons of rat olfactory bulb upon disinhibition with GABAA antagonists and/or removal of Mg 2 + from external saline. Ordinarily, LFOs presented a highly organized temporal structure, with bursts recurring regularly at about 0. 05 Hz. Slow depolarizing shifts with similar frequencies {{were observed in}} all types of <b>bulbar</b> <b>neurons.</b> Simultaneous recordings from mutually independent neurons showed that LFOs were highly synchronized in distinct cells. The occurrence of LFOs was prevented by NMDA, but not AMPA/kainate, receptor antagonists. The oscillations were also halted by Ca 2 + antagonists and tetrodotoxin. The pace of the oscillations was reset by stimulation of the olfactory nerve but not by direct injection of depolarizing current into the oscillating cell. Removal of the outer portion of the slice with a cut along the external plexiform layer provided crucial evidence that the bursting activity first initiated in the glomerular region and propagated synaptically downstream towards the inner layers, suggesting an organizing role for olfactory glomeruli...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{responses}} to odor stimulation of 40 single {{units in the}} olfactory mucosa and of 18 units in the olfactory bulb of the tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) were recorded with indium-filled, Pt-black-tipped microelectrodes. The test battery consisted of 27 odorants which were proved effective by recording from small bundles of olfactory nerve. Two concentrations of each odorant were employed. These values were adjusted for response magnitudes equal to those for amyl acetate at- 2. 5 and- 3. 5 log concentration in olfactory twig recording. Varying concentrations were generated by an injection-type olfactometer. The mucosal responses were exclusively facilitory with a peak frequency of 16 impulses/sec. 19 mucosal units responded {{to at least one}} odorant and each unit was sensitive to a limited number of odorants (1 - 15). The sensitivity pattern of each unit was highly individual, with no clear-cut types, either chemical or qualitative, emerging. Of the 18 olfactory bulb units sampled, all responded to at least one odorant. The maximum frequency observed during a response was 39 impulses/sec. The <b>bulbar</b> <b>neurons</b> can be classified into two types. There are neurons that respond exclusively with facilitation and others that respond with facilitation to some odorants and with inhibition to others. Qualitatively or chemically similar odorants did not generate similar patterns across bulbar units...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSubventricular zone (SVZ) {{neurogenesis}} continuously provides new GABA-and dopamine (DA) -containing interneurons for the olfac-tory bulb (OB) in most adult mammals. DAergic interneurons {{are located}} in the glomerular layer (GL) where they participate in the processing of sensory inputs. To examine whether adult neurogenesis might contribute to regeneration after circuit injury in mice, we induce DAergic neuronal loss by injecting 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) in the dorsal GL or in the right substantia nigra pars compacta. We found that a 6 -OHDA treatment of the OB produces olfactory deficits and local inflammation and partially decreases the number of neurons expressing the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) near the injected site. Blockade of inflammation by minocycline treatment immediately after the 6 -OHDA administration rescued neither TH ϩ interneuron number nor the olfactory deficits, suggesting that the olfactory impairments are most likely linked to TH ϩ cell death and not to microglial activation. TH ϩ interneuron number was restored 1 month later. This rescue resulted at least in part from enhanced recruitment of immature neurons targeting the lesioned GL area. Seven days after 6 -OHDA lesion in the OB, we found that the integration of lentivirus-labeled adult-born neurons was biased: newly formed neurons were preferentially incorporated into glomerular circuits of the lesioned area. Behavioral rehabilitation occurs 2 months after lesion. This study establishes a new model into which loss of DAergic cells could be compensated by recruiting newly formed neurons. We propose that adult neurogenesis not only replenishes the population of DAergic <b>bulbar</b> <b>neurons</b> but that it also restores olfactory sensory processing...|$|R
40|$|Whole-cell {{recordings}} in rat {{olfactory bulb}} slices showed that bath application of 5 mM taurine produces a potent and reversible inhibition of identified mitral and tufted cells. Under current-clamp conditions, {{a shift of}} the membrane potential toward the chloride equilibrium potential and a 75 % reduction in the membrane resistance were observed. These effects were strongly blocked by bicuculline (10 microM), but not by GABA(B) antagonist and strychnine, and completely maintained under the blockage of synaptic transmission. The results suggest that inhibition of <b>bulbar</b> relay <b>neurons</b> produced by taurine is primarily due to direct activation of somatic GABA(A) receptors and initiation of chloride conductance.

40|$|Changes in {{behavioral}} state {{are accompanied by}} coordinated changes in the information processing mode in the hippocampus and neocortex of the brain. We review here the recent progress in the knowledge of behavioral state-dependent changes in the information processing mode in the central olfactory system. Olfactory cortex shows state-dependent gating of afferent sensory inputs. In the olfactory bulb, granule-to-mitral dendrodendritic synaptic inhibition is enhanced {{and the frequency of}} synchronized oscillatory activity of <b>bulbar</b> output <b>neurons</b> decreases during slow-wave sleep or deeply anesthetized state.

40|$|The spatiotemporal {{expression}} {{patterns of}} the chemorepulsive EphA receptors, EphA 4 and EphA 7, and three ephrins-A 2, A 4 and A 5, were examined in the developing rat primary olfactory system. Unlike the visual system that has simple and stable gradients of Ephs and ephrins, the olfactory system demonstrates complex spatiotemporal expression {{patterns of the}}se molecules. Using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that expression of these molecules is dynamic and tightly regulated both within and between different cell types. We reveal restricted targeting of these proteins within subcellular compartments of some neurons. EphA 4, ephrin-A 2 and ephrin-A 5 were expressed by primary olfactory axons during the embryonic formation of the olfactory nerve. There were no gradients in expression along the rostrocaudal or ventrodorsal axes in the nasal cavity and olfactory bulb. However, during the early neonatal period, axons expressing different levels of ephrin-A 5 sorted out and terminated in a subpopulation of glomeruli that were mosaically dispersed throughout the bulb. The expression of EphA 4 and ephrin-A 2 was dramatically down-regulated on all axons during the early neonatal period of glomerular formation. The uniform co-expression of receptors and ligands before glomerular formation suggests they play a generic role in axon-axon interactions in the olfactory nerve and nerve fibre layer. In contrast, loss of EphA 4 from axons during glomerular formation may facilitate the interaction of ephrin-A 5 with Eph receptors on target cells in the bulb. While EphA 4, EphA 5 and EphA 7 are not mosaically expressed by <b>bulbar</b> <b>neurons,</b> other Eph receptors may have expression patterns complementary to the ephrin-A 5 -positive subpopulation of glomeruli.

40|$|Background: Spinal {{muscular atrophy}} (SMA) {{is the second}} most common lethal {{autosomal}} recessive disease. It is a neuromuscular disorder caused by degenerative of lower motor <b>neurons</b> and occasionally <b>bulbar</b> <b>neurons</b> leading to progressive limb paralysis and muscular atrophy. The SMN 1 gene is recognized as a SMA causing gene while NAIP has been characterized as a modifying factor for the clinical severity and age at disease onset in SMA patients (SMA subtypes). The relationship between NAIP deletion and type of SMA remains to be clarified; we investigated this gene alteration in all types of SMA patients.  Methods: Molecular analysis was performed on fifty patients with a clinical diagnosis of SMA in Khuzestan province. In addition to common PCR-RFLP analysis for exon 7 and 8 of SMN 1 gene, as an internal control we analysed NAIP deletion with PCR of exon 5 of this gene in a multiplex PCR with exon 13 of it.  Results: Homozygous-deletion frequency rate for the telomeric copy of SMN (SMN 1) exon 7 in all types (type I, II, Ш) of SMA was approximately 90 % and the frequency of deletion in exon 7 and 8 together in all types estimated about 70 %. Moreover NAIP gene was deleted in about 60 % of these patients and this shows deletion in 91 % of type I SMA patients. The correlation between NAIP-deletion and SMN 1 mutation showed a high frequency rate.  Conclusion: In this study, high frequency of NAIP gene deletion in all type of disease shows the importance role of it in disease pathogenesis. High frequency of NAIP deletion in SMA type I, also shows the importance of the gene in type and severity of disease so it may be a modifier factor in severity of disease...|$|R

40|$|SummaryGamma {{oscillations}} {{are commonly}} observed in sensory brain structures, {{notably in the}} olfactory bulb. The mechanism by which gamma is generated in the awake rodent and its functional significance are still unclear. We combined pharmacological and genetic approaches in the awake mouse olfactory bulb to show that gamma oscillations required the synaptic interplay between excitatory output neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Gamma oscillations were amplified, or abolished, after optogenetic activation or selective lesions to the <b>bulbar</b> output <b>neurons.</b> In response to a moderate increase of the excitation/inhibition ratio in output neurons, long-range gamma synchronization was selectively enhanced while the mean firing activity and the amplitude of inhibitory inputs both remained unchanged in output neurons. This excitation/inhibition imbalance also impaired odor discrimination in an olfactory learning task, suggesting that proper fast neuronal synchronization may be critical for the correct discrimination of similar sensory stimuli...|$|R
40|$|SummarySensory {{perception}} {{is not a}} simple feed-forward process, and higher brain areas can actively modulate information processing in “lower” areas. We used optogenetic methods to examine how cortical feedback projections affect circuits in the first olfactory processing stage, the olfactory bulb. Selective activation of back projections from the anterior olfactory nucleus/cortex (AON) revealed functional glutamatergic synaptic connections on several types of bulbar interneurons. Unexpectedly, AON axons also directly depolarized mitral cells (MCs), enough to elicit spikes reliably in a time window of a few milliseconds. MCs received strong disynaptic inhibition, a third of which arises in the glomerular layer. Activating feedback axons in vivo suppressed spontaneous as well as odor-evoked activity of MCs, sometimes preceded by a temporally precise increase in firing probability. Our study indicates that cortical feedback can shape the activity of <b>bulbar</b> output <b>neurons</b> by enabling precisely timed spikes and enforcing broad inhibition to suppress background activity...|$|R
40|$|In sensory systems, {{peripheral}} organs convey sensory inputs {{to relay}} networks where information {{is shaped by}} local microcircuits before being transmitted to cortical areas. In the olfactory system, odorants evoke specific patterns of sensory neuron activity that are transmitted to output neurons in olfactory bulb (OB) glomeruli. How sensory information is transferred and shaped at this level remains still unclear. Here we employ mouse genetics, 2 -photon microscopy, electrophysiology and optogenetics, to identify a novel population of glutamatergic neurons (VGLUT 3 þ) in the glomerular layer of the adult mouse OB {{as well as several}} of their synaptic targets. Both peripheral and serotoninergic inputs control VGLUT 3 þ neurons firing. Furthermore, we show that VGLUT 3 þ neuron photostimulation in vivo strongly suppresses both spontaneous and odour-evoked firing of <b>bulbar</b> output <b>neurons.</b> In conclusion, we identify and characterize here a microcircuit controlling the transfer of sensory information at an early stage of the olfactory pathway...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{assess the}} {{frequency}} and severity of coughing and choking episodes, possible related factors, and their association with chest infections in patients with motor neuron disease (MND).  METHODS—Thirty seven patients with MND and 23 healthy volunteers were studied. Cough was assessed using a questionnaire and a 3 day diary, and volitional cough quantified by peak cough flow and sound intensity. Other clinical symptoms, smoking habit, affective state, oral secretions, bulbar signs, and quantitative assessments of swallowing and respiratory function were documented.  RESULTS—Patients with MND coughed and choked significantly more often and {{to a greater degree}} than the healthy volunteers (26 of 37 patients with MND and 2 of 23 volunteers, p< 0. 001). Female sex, older age, abnormal speech, reduced swallowing capacity, and low forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted were each significantly associated with excessive coughing and choking episodes in patients with MND. Smokers had significantly more severe and prolonged episodes of coughing and choking than non-smokers (p< 0. 05). Patients with upper motor <b>neuron</b> <b>bulbar</b> signs had a greater tendency to severe and prolonged episodes of coughing and choking than those without (p< 0. 05). Chest infections were reported only rarely among the patients who coughed and choked.  CONCLUSIONS—Coughing and choking episodes are common in patients with MND but infrequently associated with overt chest infection. Upper motor <b>neuron</b> <b>bulbar</b> signs may both promote factors (for instance, dysphagia) which trigger cough and reduce volitional capacity to suppress it. ...|$|R

For the fifth patient, improvement was noted progressively. The patient with bulbar disease died 26 months after onset. A link between electric shock and motor neuron disease is likely, given the homogenous profile of the patients both in the five spinal cases presented here and in the literature. Bulbar onset has not been reported to date. However, in this patient the long delay between the electrical injury and motor neuron disease, together with the rapid evolution may suggest a chance association. ...|$|R
40|$|Spinal and bulbar {{muscular atrophy}} (Kennedy disease) is an adult form of X-linked {{motor neuron disease}} caused by the {{expansion}} of a polymorphic CAG-repeat sequence in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene. We studied clinical and molecular features of 36 patients and 19 heterozygous females. Phenotypic manifestations and disease severity broadly varied among our spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy patients. The size of CAG expansion significantly influences the age of disease onset, but neither clinical features nor disease severity. The majority of carrier women presented signs of chronic denervation at neurophysiological examination and, in three cases, low-amplitude sensory action potentials were recorded. Notably, a few women developed mild signs of <b>bulbar</b> motor <b>neuron</b> impairment later in life. The identification {{of a large number}} of patients by the use of the molecular test further supports the hypothesis that Kennedy disease had been previously underdiagnosed, probably because of the great variability of clinical presentation.

50|$|The AOB {{is divided}} into two main subregions, {{anterior}} and posterior, which receive segregated synaptic inputs from two main categories of vomeronasal sensory neurons, V1R and V2R, respectively. This appears as a clear functional specialization, given the differential role of the two populations of sensory neurons in detecting chemical stimuli of different type and molecular weight. Although it doesn't seem to be maintained centrally, where mitral cell projections {{from both sides of the}} AOB converge. A clear difference of the AOB circuitry, compared to the rest of the bulb, is its heterogeneous connectivity between mitral cells and vomeronasal sensory afferents within neuropil glomeruli. AOB mitral cells indeed contact through apical dendritic processes glomeruli formed by afferents of different receptor neurons, thus breaking the one-receptor-one-neuron rule which generally holds for the main olfactory system. This implies that stimuli sensed through the VNO and elaborated in the AOB are subjected to a different and probably more complex level of elaboration. Accordingly, AOB mitral cells show clearly different firing patterns compared to other <b>bulbar</b> projection <b>neurons.</b> Additionally, top down input to the olfactory bulb differentially affects olfactory outputs.|$|R
40|$|Olfaction plays a {{fundamental}} role in detection and discrimination {{of the environment}} in all vertebrates, including teleosts, such as the zebrafish, Danio rerio. The zebrafish olfactory system is capable to detect a wide range of chemical compounds which trigger or contribute to behaviours crucial for survival such as foraging, migration, intraspecific communication, reproduction and predator avoidance. In contrast to terrestrial vertebrates, the teleost olfactory system lacks a separate vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is known to be involved in pheromone detection. However, although the zebrafish olfactory system consists only of one paired olfactory epithelium (OE), the containing olfactory sensory neurons express olfactory receptors related to those of the main OE and VNO of mammals. Thus, the fish olfactory system is capable to detect and process pheromones and show a context related behavioral response. Beside many olfactory driven social behaviors, kin recognition is of particular relevance to the field of neurobiology, because it depends on an imprinting paradigm which requires a two step learning process of olfactory and visual cues during a defined time window early in life. Zebrafish larvae imprint on the pigmentation pattern and olfactory cue of their kin on the 5 th and 6 th day of development. The created kin template allows discriminating between kin and non-kin and plays {{a fundamental}} role at early stages, as it was shown that zebrafish larvae prefer to group with their kin whereas sexually mature zebrafish use kin recognition to avoid inbreeding. Interestingly, larvae which are exposed to non-kin cues at the appropriate days show neither preference for kin nor for non-kin, suggesting a genetic predisposition for kin cues. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying olfactory imprinting and kin recognition are unknown so far. Recent studies demonstrated that zebrafish recognize their kin based on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II genotype similarity. Zebrafish which share MHC class II alleles show a similar pigmentation pattern (visual cue) as well as chemical signature (olfactory cue) and thus MHC class II genotype similarity may explain the genetic predisposition which prevents larvae to imprint on non-kin cues. Moreover, olfactory stimulation with MHC class II peptide ligands shows spatially overlapping activation of <b>bulbar</b> <b>neurons</b> compared to responses to kin odor, suggesting MHC peptides to be part of kin odor. Presently, the type of olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) which detects a kin odor related signal is unknown. The zebrafish OE bears four different types of OSNs, ciliated- and microvillous OSNs, kappe neurons and crypt cells; each type showing morphological- and immunohistochemical characteristics. Our study combines behavioral, genetic and neuroanatomical methods to investigate the neuronal mechanisms involved in the processes of olfactory imprinting and kin recognition in the zebrafish. The first aim {{of this study is to}} provide new insights to the anatomy of the larval and adult zebrafish olfactory system. Combinatorial immunohistological analysis of four different calcium binding proteins (CBPs), Parvalbumin, Calretinin, Calbindin and S 100, reveals a differential expression pattern of OSNs and their axonal projections into the olfactory bulb (OB). Combinatorial double immunohistochemistry identifies at least eight subpopulations of OSNs. We report three subpopulations of ciliated OSNs - one major subpopulation expresses Parvalbumin, Calbindin and Calretinin, and two populations are either positive for Parvalbumin and Calbindin or Calretinin only. Furthermore, we identify four subpopulations of microvillous OSNs, one expresses only Parvalbumin, one minor population shows S 100 and Parvalbumin positivity, one is positive for Parvalbumin and Calbindin and finally one subpopulation of microvillous OSNs which is immunoreactive for Parvalbumin, Calbindin and Calretinin. Crypt cells, absent in terrestrial vertebrates and only present in teleosts, express only S 100 and are negative for all other CBPs. Consistent with other reports, axonal projections of ciliated OSNs terminate into dorso- and ventromedial bulbar fields whereas microvillous OSNs project their axon into the ventrolateral OB. Additionally, we newly describe axonal projections of likewise microvillous OSNs which only express Parvalbumin and terminate into the mediodorsal OB. Moreover, we show S 100 positive crypt cells to terminate into one single mediodorsal glomerulus, the mdg 2, but also show additional axonal input into this glomerulus from S 100 and Parvalbumin expressing microvillous OSNs. To investigate the type(s) of OSNs which detect a kin odor related signal, we focused on finding a reliable marker for neuronal activity in response to olfactory stimulation. The Extracellular signal Regulated Kinase (ERK) is a member of the ERK / Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Activation, for instance by binding of a ligand to an olfactory receptor leads to phosphorylation and therefore activation of ERK (pERK) which in turn translocates into the cell nucleus to modulate gene expression. In mammals, pERK is a common marker for neuronal activity and was previously used in the field of olfaction. Before starting to approach the identity of the OSN type involved in kin recognition, we validated pERK as a reliable marker for neuronal activation in the larval zebrafish after odor exposure. To this aim, we stimulated group raised larvae at the 9 th day of development with different odors and analyzed neuronal activation visualized by pERK immunopositivity in the larval zebrafish OE. With the use of accepted morphological criteria, we identified the four differenttypes of OSNs of the zebrafish OE. Additionally, we used the CBP S 100 to mark specifically crypt cells. For the first time in larval zebrafish, we performed a timescale experiment to test best odor exposure duration with the result that detectable pERK levels are recognizable already after 3 minutes of odor exposure. However, prolonging the exposure duration does not lead to better pERK signals in OSNs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that olfactory stimulation with food and non-kin odor (conspecific odor) clearly results in a differential activation pattern of OSNs. Consistent with other studies, we identify activated ciliated and microvillous OSNs after exposure to food odor, whereas only microvillous cells show responses to conspecific odor. Crypt cells show activation neither to food odor nor to non-kin odor. Upon validation of pERK to mark neuronal activation in the larval zebrafish OE, we stimulated imprinted and non-imprinted 9 day old larvae with kin odor and analyzed activated OSNs. In two rounds of stimulation experiments, each with slightly different raising conditions, we provide the first direct evidence for crypt cells as well as a small subpopulation of microvillous cells to be involved in detection of a kin odor related signal. Interestingly, only larvae which were successfully imprinted show activated crypt cells in response to kin odor, whereas crypt cells of non-imprinted larvae show no increase in pERK levels. A difference in crypt cell number does not account for this difference in activation pattern as a comparison of crypt cell quantity reveals no significant difference between imprinted and non-imprinted larvae. Furthermore, we analyzed neuronal activation of <b>bulbar</b> <b>neurons</b> after exposure to kin odor. Consistent with our results on activation at the level of the larval OE, <b>bulbar</b> <b>neurons</b> of imprinted larvae show increased neuronal activation compared to non-imprinted larvae especially around the mediodorsal glomerulus that receives crypt cell input (mdG 2) after kin odor exposure. The final aim of this study is to identify the existence of an accessory olfactory pathway in teleosts. In tetrapods, vomeronasal information is mainly transferred from the VNO to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) and from there to the medial amygdala. The medial amygdala is a part of the subpallium and initiates via amygdalo-hypothalamic pathways behavioral and also hormonal responses to incoming signals. Moreover, besides an involvement in fear and associative learning, the medial amygdala is also known to be involved in processing of conspecific odors in rodents. Although a separate VNO is absent in teleosts, we newly identify an accessory olfactory pathway in the zebrafish. By injection of DiI tracer into the mediodorsal OB, which is the target region of crypt cells and some microvillous OSNs, we demonstrate a neuronal circuit running from the mediodorsal OB to the medial amygdala and from there to the tuberal hypothalamus. Interestingly, non-imprinted zebrafish larvae show increased activity of neurons in the medial amygdala compared to imprinted larvae. Finally, we demonstrate for the first time the OSN type which is involved in the detection as well as processing targets of a kin odor related signal in larval zebrafish...|$|R

The Group I agonist DHPG induced a depolarization, which could be largely blocked by mGluR 1 antagonists. The DHPG action i) was prevented by buffering intracellular Ca(2 +) with BAPTA and by a phospholipase C inhibitor; ii) was not affected by the block of Ca(2 +) entry, and iii) was blocked by inhibitors of the Na(+) /Ca(2 +) exchanger. These observations were interpreted as a mGluR 1 -mediated intracellular Ca(2 +) release, followed by the {{activation of}} an electrogenic Na(+) /Ca(2 +) exchanger. The mGluR 5 agonist CHPG induced a hyperpolarization of membrane potential, resulting in a decrease of the spontaneous firing frequency.

TAU action seems to be associated with gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter involved in the processing of the sensory signal. The present study was designed to assess the action of TAU in vivo during the olfactory network’s stimulation by odors. It was performed by recording the single-unit activity of mitral cells, the main <b>bulbar</b> output <b>neurons.</b> TAU effects were tested on both their spontaneous and odor-induced firing activity. Interactions between TAU and GABA were examined by analyzing TAU effects under the selective blocking action of GABA A or GABA B antagonists. TAU was found to suppress the spontaneous firing of mitral cells, mainly without altering their odor response properties. By testing GABA antagonists, we further show that TAU action is associated with GABAergic inhibitory mechanisms mainly via GABA B receptors. Thus, TAU action clearly reduces background activity in favor of the emergence of the odor-induced activity {{in the same manner as}} GABA action does via GABA B receptors. As a conclusion, we propose that, in the frog olfactory bulb, the joint actions of TAU and GABA may favor the processing of the primary sensory information by increasing the signal to noise ratio...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOlfactory stimuli {{have been}} {{known for a long}} time to elicit {{oscillations}} in olfactory brain areas. In the olfactory bulb (OB), odors trigger synchronous oscillatory activity that is believed to arise from the coherent and rhythmic discharges of large numbers of neurons. These oscillations are known to take part in encoding of sensory information before their transfer to higher subcortical and cortical areas. To characterize the cellular mechanisms underlying gamma (30 - 80 Hz) local field potential (LFP) oscillations, we simultaneously recorded multiunit discharges, intracellular responses, and LFP in rat OB slices. We showed that a single and brief electrical stimulation of olfactory nerve elicited LFP oscillations in the mitral cell body layer lasting > 1 sec. Both action potentials and subthreshold oscillations of mitral/tufted cells, the <b>bulbar</b> output <b>neurons,</b> were precisely synchronized with LFP oscillations. This synchronization arises from the interaction between output neurons and granule cells, the main population of local circuit inhibitory interneurons, through dendrodendritic synapses. Interestingly enough, the synchronization exerted by reciprocal synaptic interactions did not require action potentials initiated in granule cell somata. Finally, local application of a GABA(A) receptor antagonist at the mitral cell and external plexiform layers confirmed the exclusive role of the granule cell reciprocal synapses in generating the evoked oscillations. We concluded that interneurons located in the granule cell layer generate synaptic activity capable of synchronizing activity of output neurons by interacting with both their subthreshold and spiking activity...|$|R

A reliable identification of single DA neurons {{was made possible by}} use of a transgenic of mice line expressing eGFP under the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter. At 37 °C and minimizing the disturbance of the intracellular milieu with perforated patches, this current shows a midpoint of activation around − 82. 7 mV, with a significant level of opening already at rest, thereby giving a substantial contribution to the resting potential, and ultimately playing a relevant function in the control of the cell excitability. The blockage of Ih influences the spontaneous firing of these neurons, which results strongly depressed. However the effect is not due to a direct role of the current in the pacemaker process, but to the Ih influence on the resting membrane potential. Ih kinetics is sensitive to the intracellular levels of cAMP, whose increase promotes a depolarizing shift of the activation curve. Application of DA and 5 -HT neurotransmitters, physiologically released onto <b>bulbar</b> dopaminergic <b>neurons</b> and known to act on metabotropic receptors coupled to the cAMP pathway, do not modify the Ih amplitude, whereas noradrenaline almost halves the Ih amplitude.

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{demonstrate}} the ability to enhance nerve regeneration by remote delivery of a viral vector to the crushed recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), to demonstrate the usefulness of a crushed RLN model to test the efficacy of viral gene therapy, and to discuss future potential applications of this approach. Study Design: Animal study. Methods: Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to two groups. In the experimental group, an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector carrying a zinc-finger transcription factor, which stimulates endogenous insulinlike growth factor I production (AAV 2 -TO- 6876 vp 16), was injected into the crushed RLN. In the control group, an AAV vector carrying the gene for green flu-orescent protein was injected into the crushed RLN. Unilateral RLN paralysis was confirmed endoscopically. At 1 week, laryn-geal endoscopies were repeated and recorded. Larynges were cryosectioned in 15 -lm sections and processed for acetylcho-line histochemistry (motor endplates) followed by neurofilament immunoperoxidase (nerve fibers). Percentage nerve-endplate contact (PEC) was determined and compared. Vocal fold motion was evaluated by blinded reviewers using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Results: The difference between PEC on the crushed and uncrushed sides was statistically less in the experimental group (0. 54 6 0. 18 vs. 0. 30 6 0. 26, P. 0006). The VAS score at 1 week was significantly better in the experimental group (P. 002). Conclusions: AAV 2 -TO- 6876 vp 16 demonstrated a neurotrophic effect when injected into the crushed RLN.

Possession of at least one ε 4 allele was significantly more common in patients with <b>bulbar</b> onset motor <b>neuron</b> disease (14 / 33, 42 %) than in limb onset patients (20 / 90, 22 %) and controls (26 / 121, 21 %) (χ 2 = 4. 93, p = 0. 026 and χ 2 = 5. 91, p = 0. 015, respectively).

40|$|For many organisms {{the sense}} of smell is {{critical}} to survival. Some olfactory stimuli elicit innate responses that are mediated through hardwired circuits that have developed {{over long periods of}} evolutionary time. Most olfactory stimuli, however, have no inherent meaning. Instead, meaning must be imposed by learning during the lifetime of an organism. Despite the dominance of olfactory stimuli on animal behavior, the mechanisms by which odorants elicit learned behavioral responses remain poorly understood. All odor-evoked behaviors are initiated by the binding of an odorant to olfactory receptors located on sensory neurons in the nasal epithelium. Olfactory sensory neurons transmit this information to the olfactory bulb via spatially organized axonal projections such that individual odorants evoke a stereotyped map of bulbar activity. A subset of <b>bulbar</b> <b>neurons,</b> the mitral and tufted cells, relay olfactory information to higher brain structures that have been implicated in the generation of innate and learned behavioral responses, including the cortical amygdala and piriform cortex. Anatomical studies have demonstrated that the spatial stereotypy of the olfactory bulb is maintained in projections to the posterolateral cortical amygdala, a structure that is involved in the generation of innate odor-evoked responses. The projections of mitral and tufted cells to piriform cortex however appear to discard the spatial order of the olfactory bulb: each glomerulus sends spatially diffuse, apparently random projections across the entire cortex. This anatomy appears to constrain odor-evoked responses in piriform cortex: electrophysiological and imaging studies demonstrate that individual odorants activate sparse ensembles that are distributed across the extent of cortex, and individual piriform neurons exhibit discontinuous receptive fields such that they respond to structurally and perceptually similar and dissimilar odorants. It is therefore unlikely that olfactory representations in piriform have inherent meaning. Instead, these representations have been proposed to mediate olfactory learning. In accord with this, lesions of posterior piriform cortex prevent the expression of a previously acquired olfactory fear memory and photoactivation of a random ensemble of piriform neurons can become entrained to both appetitive and aversive outcomes. Piriform cortex therefore plays a central role in olfactory fear learning. However, how meaning is imparted on olfactory representations in piriform remains largely unknown. We developed a strategy to manipulate the neural activity of representations of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a downstream target of piriform cortex that has been implicated in the generation of learned responses. This strategy allowed us to demonstrate that distinct neural ensembles represent an appetitive and an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) in the BLA. Moreover, the activity of these representations can elicit innate responses as well as direct Pavlovian and instrumental learning. Finally activity of an aversive US representation in the basolateral amygdala is required for learned olfactory and auditory fear responses. These data suggest that both olfactory and auditory stimuli converge on US representations in the BLA to generate learned behavioral responses. Having identified a US representation in the BLA that receives convergent olfactory information to generate learned fear responses, we were then able to step back into the olfactory system and demonstrate that the BLA receives olfactory input via the monosynaptic projection from piriform cortex. These data suggest that aversive meaning is imparted on an olfactory representation in piriform cortex via reinforcement of its projections onto a US representation in the BLA. The work described in this thesis has identified mechanisms by which sensory stimuli generate appropriate behavioral responses. Manipulations of representations of unconditioned stimuli have identified a central role for US representations in the BLA in connecting sensory stimuli to both innate and learned behavioral responses. In addition, these experiments have suggested local mechanisms by which fear learning might be implemented in the BLA. Finally, we have identified a fundamental transformation through which a disordered olfactory representation in piriform cortex acquires meaning. Strikingly this transformation appears to occur within 3 synapses of the periphery. These data, and the techniques we employ, therefore have the potential to significantly impact upon our understanding of the neural origins of motivated behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{olfactory}} bulb (OB) of mammals contains {{a large population}} of dopaminergic interneurons (DA) within the glomerular layer (GL). Dopamine has been shown both in vivo and in vitro to modulate several aspects of olfactory information processing, but the functional properties of DA neurons have rarely been described due to the inability to recognize these cells in living preparations. We succeeded in this by using a transgenic mouse strain harboring an eGFP reporter construct under the promoter of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme for cathecolamine synthesis. As a result, we could identify dopaminergic neurons (TH-GFP cells) in living preparations and study the functional properties of such neurons in the OB, in both slices and dissociated cells. The most prominent feature of DA neurons was the autorhythmicity. In these cells we identified five main voltage-dependent conductances: the two having largest amplitude were a fast transient Na+ current and a delayed rectifier K+ current. In addition, we observed three smaller inward currents, sustained by Na+ ions (persistent type) and by Ca 2 + ions (low- and high-voltage activated). Using pharmacological tools and ion substitution methods we showed that the pacemaking process {{is supported by the}} interplay of the persistent Na+ current and of a T-type Ca 2 +current. A significant fraction of the interneurons added in adulthood to the GL of the OB are dopaminergic. Typically, <b>bulbar</b> DA <b>neurons</b> are restricted to the GL, but we also detected the presence of TH-GFP+ cells in the mitral and external plexiform layers. We hypothesized that these could be adult-generated neurons committed to become DA but not yet entirely differentiated. Accordingly, TH-GFP+ cells outside the GL exhibit functional properties (appearance of pacemaker currents, synaptic connection with the olfactory nerve, intracellular chloride concentration, and other), marking a gradient of maturity toward the dopaminergic phenotype along the mitral-glomerular axis. Finally, we propose that the establishment of a synaptic contact with the olfactory nerve is the key event allowing these cells to complete their differentiation toward the DA phenotype and to reach their final destination...|$|R
40|$|Spinal {{muscular atrophy}} (SMA) is a {{disorder}} characterized by degeneration of lower motor <b>neurons</b> and occasionally <b>bulbar</b> motor <b>neurons</b> leading to progressive limb and trunk paralysis {{as well as}} muscular atrophy. Three types of SMA are recognized depending on the age of onset, the maximum muscular activity achieved, and survivorship: SMA 1, SMA 2, and SMA 3. The survival of motor neuron (SMN) gene {{has been identified as}} an SMA determining gene, whereas the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) gene {{is considered to be a}} modifying factor of the severity of SMA. The main objective of this study was to analyze the deletion of SMN 1 and NAIP genes in southern Chinese children with SMA. Here, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was performed to detect the deletion of both exon 7 and exon 8 of SMN 1 and exon 5 of NAIP in 62 southern Chinese children with strongly suspected clinical symptoms of SMA. All the 32 SMA 1 patients and 76 % (13 / 17) of SMA 2 patients showed homozygous deletions for exon 7 and exon 8, and all the 13 SMA 3 patients showed single deletion of SMN 1 exon 7 along with 24 % (4 / 17) of SMA 2 patients. Eleven out of 32 (34 %) SMA 1 patients showed NAIP deletion, and none of SMA 2 and SMA 3 patients was found to have NAIP deletion. The findings of homozygous deletions of exon 7 and/or exon 8 of SMN 1 gene confirmed the diagnosis of SMA, and suggested that the deletion of SMN 1 exon 7 is a major cause of SMA in southern Chinese children, and that the NAIP gene may be a modifying factor for disease severity of SMA 1. The molecular diagnosis system based on PCR-RFLP analysis can conveniently be applied in the clinical testing, genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic diagnosis of SMA...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES—In neurogenic {{dysphagia}} a good cough {{is important}} for airway protection. If triggering of cough, or its effectiveness, is impaired this might result in an increased aspiration risk. Capsaicin, an agent which induces cough through sensory nerve stimulation, {{was used to test}} cough sensitivity in groups of patients with and without neurogenic dysphagia.  METHODS—On the basis of swallowing speed (ml/s) in a validated water test 28 alert neurological inpatients (16 women, aged 22 - 71 years) were classified into 13 with abnormal and 15 with normal swallowing (median swallowing speed 23 % and 99 %, median volume/swallow 43 % and 106 % of that predicted for age and sex respectively: p< 0. 001). Capsaicin nebulised on air in saline was inhaled via a low resistance valve using a mouthpiece and noseclip. Up to seven incremental concentrations of capsaicin ranging from 0. 07 - 20. 0 × 10 − 4 mol/l were each inhaled for up to a minute. A pneumotachograph connected to the expiratory limb gave a paper recording of expiratory air flow. Coughs were recorded as high flow expirations of short duration. Capsaicin concentrations at first cough (threshold) were recorded; concentrations at frequencies of 10 and 20 coughs/minute were interpolated from the dose-reponse curve.  RESULTS—Cough threshold tended to be lower in those with abnormal swallowing (non-significant) : the (log) concentration of capsaicin producing 10 or 20 coughs/minute also tended to be lower (p= 0. 12 and 0. 07 respectively) in those with abnormal swallowing.  CONCLUSION—Contrary to expectation, these results suggest that cough responsiveness is enhanced in alert patients with neurogenic dysphagia even after allowing for diagnostic category, the possible presence of a <b>bulbar</b> upper motor <b>neuron</b> lesion, or voluntary respiratory capacity. It is concluded that these patients with neurogenic dysphagia do not have a reduced sensitivity of cough triggering. ...|$|R
40|$|Clinicopathological {{heterogeneity}} {{complicates the}} study of neurodegenerative diseases. In motor neuron disease (MND), variability in clinical phenotype and prognosis is well recognised. In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), three distinct clinical phenotypes are described, including the behavioural variant FTD, semantic dementia and progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA). Clinical and pathological overlaps between FTD and MND exist, and the recent discovery of a hexanucleotide repeat (C 9 ORF 72) in {{a significant proportion of}} both sporadic and familial FTD and MND indicates the importance of this rapidly developing area. Heterogeneity also characterises corticobasal syndrome (CBS), which presents with multifaceted motor and cognitive deficits. In this thesis, several potential disease biomarkers, including threshold tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), saccadometry, voxel-based morphometry analysis (VBM), and (11 C) Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) were used, to improve understanding of clinicopathological heterogeneity in MND, FTD and CBS. After describing the background of the disorders covered (Chapter 1) and the experimental design used (Chapter 2), Chapter 3 describes clinical and neurophysiological features of an isolated bulbar palsy phenotype (IBP) of MND. IBP patients were predominantly female with prominent upper motor <b>neuron</b> <b>bulbar</b> symptoms and normal cortical excitability, measured using threshold tracking TMS. Chapter 4 identified clinical and neurophysiological evidence of motor dysfunction in a significant proportion of FTD patients, most prominently in PNFA. Chapter 5 demonstrated prolonged median reflexive saccade latencies in FTD, despite an increased incidence of early saccades; both abnormalities correlated with frontal eye field atrophy. Chapter 6 demonstrated cortical dysfunction in CBS and correlated this with core clinical features (apraxia and visuospatial dysfunction) and atrophy of motor structures using VBM. Chapter 7 compared clinical and neuropsychological characteristics of CBS due to Alzheimer's pathology to other CBS, using PiB-PET to classify patients. Unravelling the heterogeneity underlying the complex clinical presentations across the spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases studied in this thesis will facilitate early diagnoses and the introduction of directed therapeutic approaches. Several clinical biomarkers developed in the present studies may serve to better differentiate disease groups, in addition to clarifying the underlying pathological basis...|$|R
40|$|For a {{wide variety}} of organisms on the planet, the sense of smell is of {{critical}} importance for survival. The mouse olfactory system mediates both learned and innate odor-driven behaviors, including activities as diverse as the localization of food sources, the avoidance of predators, and the selection of mates. How a chemical stimulus in the environment ultimately leads to the generation of an appropriate behavioral response, however, remains poorly understood. All of these behaviors begin with the binding of an odorant in the external environment to receptors on sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium. These sensory neurons transmit this odor information to neurons in the olfactory bulb via spatially stereotyped axonal projections, and a subset of these <b>bulbar</b> <b>neurons,</b> mitral and tufted cells, in turn transmit this information to a number of higher brain regions implicated in both learned and innate odor-driven behaviors, including the piriform cortex and amygdala. Previous work has revealed that odorants drive activity in unique, sparse ensembles of neurons distributed across the piriform cortex without apparent spatial preference. The patterns of neural activity observed, however, do not reveal whether mitral and tufted cell projections from a given glomerulus to piriform are segregated or distributed, or whether they are random or determined. Distinguishing between these possibilities is important for understanding the function of piriform cortex: a random representation of odor identity in the piriform could accommodate learned olfactory behaviors, but cannot specify innate odor-driven responses. In addition, behavioral studies in which the function of the amygdala has been compromised have found that innate odor-driven behaviors are disrupted by these manipulations while learned odor-driven behaviors are left intact, strongly suggesting a role for the amygdala in innate olfactory responses. How odor information is represented in the amygdala, as well as the amygdala's exact role in the generation of olfactory responses, however, remain poorly understood. We therefore developed a strategy to trace the projections from identified glomeruli in the olfactory bulb to these higher olfactory centers. Electroporation of TMR dextran into single glomeruli has permitted us to define the neural circuits that convey olfactory information from specific glomeruli in the olfactory bulb to the piriform cortex and amygdala. We find that mitral and tufted cells from every glomerulus elaborate similar axonal arbors in the piriform. These projections densely fan out across the cortical surface in a homogeneous manner, and quantitative analyses fail to identify features that distinguish the projection patterns from different glomeruli. In contrast, the cortical amygdala receives spatially stereotyped projections from individual glomeruli. The stereotyped projections from each glomerulus target a subregion of the posterolateral cortical nucleus, but may overlap extensively with projections from other glomeruli. The apparently random pattern of projections to the piriform and the determined pattern of projections to the amygdala are likely to provide the anatomic substrates for distinct odor-driven behaviors mediated by these two brain regions. The dispersed mitral and tufted cell projections to the piriform provide the basis for the generation of previously observed patterns of neural activity and suggest a role for the piriform cortex in learned olfactory behaviors, while the pattern of mitral and tufted cell projections to the posterolateral amygdala implicate this structure in the generation of innate odor-driven behaviors. We have also developed high-throughput methods for imaging odor-evoked activity in targeted populations of neurons in multiple areas of the olfactory system to investigate how odor information is represented and transformed by the mouse brain. We have used a modified rabies virus that drives expression of GCaMP 3, a calcium-sensitive indicator of neural activity, to image odor-evoked responses from mitral and tufted cells, as well as a modified adenoassociated virus that drives expression of GCaMP 3 to image odor-evoked responses from neurons in piriform cortex. These imaging methods have permitted us to examine odor-evoked responses in a transgenic mouse where 95 % of sensory neurons express a single kind of olfactory receptor (M 71). In these mice, there is a 1, 000 -fold increase in sensory neurons expressing the M 71 receptor ligand acetophenone, and a 20 -fold reduction in neurons expressing olfactory receptors from the endogenous repertoire. These M 71 transgenic mice provide a useful tool for examining the role that the normally stereotyped pattern of sensory neuron input to the bulb plays in olfactory processing, as well as how odor information is transformed as is moves from the sensory periphery to the cortex. In control mice, odors evoke activity in unique ensembles of spatially distributed, narrowly tuned mitral and tufted cells, and the number of cells responding to odor increases linearly with stimulus concentration. Surprisingly, despite {{the fact that there is}} a significant decrease in sensory neuron activity in response to odors other than acetophenone in M 71 transgenics, {{a wide variety}} of odorants are able to evoke mitral and tufted cell activity in these mice. Furthermore, the number of cells responding to these odors as well as the magnitude of these odor-evoked responses are higher in M 71 transgenics compared to controls. However, despite a massive increase in acetophenone-evoked sensory neuron input to the bulb in M 71 transgenics, mitral and tufted cell responses to acetophenone are similar in M 71 transgenics and controls. Our results provide evidence for excitatory mechanisms that amplify weak sensory neuron input as well as inhibitory mechanisms that suppress strong, pervasive odor-evoked input, suggesting that a major role of the olfactory bulb is to aid in the comprehensive detection and refinement of olfactory signals from the environment. Despite the fact that the representation of odor in the olfactory bulb of M 71 transgenic mice differs from that observed in controls, we find the representations of odor in the piriform cortex of M 71 transgenic mice and controls is quantitatively indistinguishable. Our results suggest that circuits intrinsic to the piriform significantly transform the representation of odor information as it moves from the olfactory bulb to the piriform cortex. Moreover, in comparison to the olfactory bulb, the piriform encodes odor in a more sparse, distributed manner within a much narrower dynamic range. The nature of the representation of odor we observe in piriform cortex further supports a role for this area in mediating odor discrimination and associative odor-driven behaviors. The work described in this thesis has provided insight into the way odor is represented in several areas of the mouse olfactory system, clues about how odor information is transformed as it passes through the brain, and the role that different areas of the olfactory system play in odor-driven perception and behavior. In the future, the novel techniques and methods described in this thesis can be applied to the study of many different areas of the mammalian brain, giving our work the potential to have a significant impact on our understanding of how patterns of neural activity may ultimately underlie the generation of perceptions, emotions, and behaviors...|$|R
