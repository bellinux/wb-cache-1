Onopordum is a valuable medicinal plant that is widely used in traditional medicine in Europe. The application of Onopordum as food is limited and its main importance is due to medicine utilization. Because of having flavonoid compositions, Onopordum is an important plant. The Genus Onopordum L. (Asteraceae) includes about 38 species. The representatives of the genus are native to Europe, Northern Africa, the Canary Island, the Caucasus, Southwest and Central Asia.

In this study, we deter-mined the levels of U-benzene among Japanese university students exposed to benzene nonoccupationally and analyzed the relation betweenU-benzene levels and the possible factors responsible for environmental benzene exposure. In urinalysis, U-benzene concentration among 124 students was detected in the range from 18 (minimum detection limit) to 249 ng/l. The frequency distribution of U-benzene concentration peaked at 0 – 19 ng/l. Mean and median values of 40 and 20 ng/l for U-benzene concentration in nonoc-cupationally exposed subjects were lower than those in a previous study. Stepwise multiple linear regres-sion analysis was performed to assess the potential sources of exposure to environmental benzene by analyzing the relation between U-benzene and personal, behavioral, and environmental factors. The results showed that only smoking habit (P < 0. 01) and residential house age (P < 0. 05) were independent determinants of U-benzene levels.

40|$|Owing to the {{dramatically}} {{increased number of}} 3 D structures of pharmaceutical targets, structure based approaches {{play an important role}} in drug design. Especially, rapid and accurate estimation of binding affinities is essential for efficient screening of drugs. For this purpose, the free energy based screen methods have been developed by some groups. These methods are much faster than the free energy perturbation (FEP) method or thermodynamic integration method, and give more accurate relative free energies than the empirical scoring function methods. 　　　The λ-dynamics method, one of these methods, has been recently developed by Brooks and co-workers. The λ-dynamics method is an extension of the FEP method. It differs from the FEP method in the following aspects: (1) In the FEP method, a single coupling parameter λ is used to transform one ligand to another. While in the λ-dynamics method, multiple λs, each corresponding to a given ligand, are used. Because of this feature, the binding free energies of multiple ligands are evaluated simultaneously. (2) In the FEP method λ is fixed during the simulation. While in λ-dynamics, the λs evolve according to their equations of motion via use of an extended system. The free energy difference can be obtained from the probability of the ligand i having the dominant state (i. e. λ i = 1, {λ m≠i = 0 }). In this method, the total computation time is not expected to increase with the total number of ligands because only the few favorable binders are able to compete for the λ= 1 state. This is in coutrast to the conventional free energy calculation methods. 　　　The λ-dynamics method was used to study the binding of 10 heterocycle derivatives to an artificial cavity created inside cytochrome c peroxidase and the host guest system of β- cyclodextrin-monosubstituted benzene derivatives. Straightforward application of λ-dynamics using a multiple topology approach resulted in trapping in local minima. To extend the λ- dynamics method to multiple topology model, a new restraining potential, which keeps the ligands in lower-energy states, is added to the λ-dynamics Hamiltonian. Relatively short time λ- dynamics simulations with the restraining potential successfully identified the best binders as compared with both experimental data and FEP calculations. Using the iterative procedure with biasing potentials to enhance convergence, λ-dynamics method successfully yielded reasonable estimates of the binding affinity of all ligands. Furthermore, long time λ-dynamics simulations revealed that better ligands tend to have small statistical errors, which is appropriate for screening out the plausible ligands from all candidates. This methodology also provides a means to explore the binding orientations and conformations of the ligands inside the binding pocket much better than does conventional MD. A λ-dynamics simulation starting from random initial orientations, in which some ligands take significantly different orientations as compared with those from the X-ray structure successfully sample the X-ray crystallographic orientations in all ligands, even though conventional MD starting from the same initial structures remain trapped in the local minima from which they start. Such an efficient sampling of ligand orientation and conformation is expected to diminish the limitation that an initial ligand structure must be close to its true bound orientation in order to get a reasonable estimate of binding free energy. 　　　The incorporation of the generalized Born (GB) approach into free energy simulation methods (e. g. FEP or λ-dynamics) using thermodynamic cycles was introduced and applied to the trypsin-benzamidine derivatives system and seven mono-substituted <b>benzen</b> derivatives bound to β-cyclodextrin. Since the GB model is fully analytical continuum solvation representation, derivatives of the energy with respect to individual atoms are available and allow the effect of solvation to be efficiently included in molecular dynamics, The GB energies for the intermediate states, in which more than one ligand obtained competitive λ values, were defined by two ways. Both GB coupling schemes have been incorporated into the program CHARMM. The free energy simulations using both definitions of the GB implicit solvent model gave consistent binding free energy differences (ΔΔG) as compared to those using an explicit solvation model. Non- electrostatic solvation energy contributions, which are not included in the GB energies and approximately related to the solvent-accessible surface area, were successfully included using umbrella sampling techniques. Furthermore, a variant of the λ-dynamics approach, Chemical Monte Carlo / molecular dynamics method (CMC/MD), was implemented in CHARMM and compared with FEP and λ-dynamics methods. In the CMC/MD method, the Metropolis Monte Carlo criterion is used to evolve the λ-space and molecular dynamics is used to evolve the atomic coordinates. Free energy differences calculated using the GB energy agreed well among FEP, λ-dynamics, and CMC/MD. The λ dependent partial charge model was also introduced for the incorporation of hybrid topology model into the λ-dynamics method. In this model, the invariable ligand atoms are represented by the single topology and their partial charges are altered according to the movement of the coupling parameters as they would be the same as those of the end points. The hybrid topology λ-dynamics/GB simulations successfully converged without any restraining potential, however, the sampling configurational space was restricted as compared with that of multiple topology model. 　　　They have also applied the λ-dynamics method for the stability analysis of the DNA- binding domain of the Myb transcriptional regulator. In this case, seven different side-chain mutants simultaneously compete to make the protein stabilize, whereas, multiple ligands compete in the previous λ-dynamics simulations. A single short (300 ps) λ-dynamics simulation successfully identified the best stabilized mutant. Furthemore, a series of λ-dynamics trajectories generated by the iterative techniques based on Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM) showed excellent correlation with data obtained from the conventional FEP simulations or experiments. The additional biasing potentials along λ coordinates successfully increased the ratio of the end points without wasting time by sampling unphysical intermediate states in the λ- dynamics simulations. 　　　Furthermore, a hybrid Monte Carlo and Langevin dynamics method (MC/LD) was introduced to study the binding orientations of toluene in β-cyclodextrin. In this method, the guest atoms are replicated. One of the replicas is sampled with the full force of the host, while the rest of the replicas are sampled with scaled "ghost force" to find the other local minima. In constant time intervals of Langevin dynamics (LD) simulation, Monte Carlo method is applied to choose a new guest among all replicas, which helps to jump the barrier quickly. The trajectory of the MC/LD simulation successfully gave the broader set of binding orientations as compared with the conventional MD trajectory. The potential of mean force calculated using its trajectory gave the good agreement with that calculated by intensive computational use of umbrella sampling method and WHAM. Therefore, MC/LD can succeed in both exploring the free energy surface much more efficiently and yielding the canonical ensemble of the system. 　　　In conclusion, they have developed and applied the free energy based screening methods such as λ-dynamics and CMC/MD. These methods will be used either to rapidly identify ligands with favorable binding free energy or to estimate specific clange in free energy using the iterative procedure with WHAM. Since they screen the binding free energy of the ligands instead of interaction energy, they provide accurate assessment of binding affinity. The restraining potential is very effective and important for the application of the λ-dynamics method to a multiplc topology model. It successfully enhanced both sampling of λ-space and binding configurations of the ligands. The combination of the GB model with λ-dynamics or CMC/MD has a great potential in the application for drug lead optimization. These combinations may fill the gap between the empirical methods using a single minimized complex structure and the theoretically rigorous methods like FEP or thermodynamic integration. The hybrid topology λ-dynamics representation with λ dependent partial charge model will be the promising representation when one investigates free energy changes for an ensemble of slightly varying ligands. Moreover, the MC/LD method can be applied efficiently to explore the free energy surface which will be useful in many purposes such as the protein folding studies, the loop search, or the conformational search of side chains...|$|E
40|$|The {{endeavor}} {{to have more}} efficient solar cells and as environmentally beneficial as possible are the driving forces for this work. The way to reach this is by research to better {{the understanding of the}} mechanisms and parameters that govern the performance of solar cells. New materials are essential to develop because the current ones lack stability and are water, temperature and UV-radiation sensitive. In this work the lead (Pb 2 +), which is poisonous and hazardous is intended to be replaced in the organic metal halide (OMH) perovskite structure. This is tested with gold or silver combined with bismuth and silver by itself. Also trimethylsulfonium gold or silver iodides are investigated. The methylammonium cation is also substituted to cesium. The perovskite material both absorbs light and transports charges in the solar cells. Materials based on AuI/AgI, BiI 3 and CH 3 NH 3 I and AuI/AgI and [Me 3 S]I and AgI, BiI 3 and CsI were synthesized and analyzed by XRD on thin film and mesoporous substrate and Raman spectroscopy to determine material structure and bonding. J-V measurements were performed to see the function in solar cells. After this conductivity and absorption parameters were determined by an electrical conductivity test and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. XRD measurements indicate that the perovskite structure could have been obtained because the materials match with the XRD spectra of [20] foremost T 3, T 5 and T 6, Cs 1 and Cs 2. In T 7 some new structure is formed. The bismuth could be partially substituted by silver as the metal cation. The samples are quite amorphous, but still containing crystalline peaks, the product material could be a mixture of a crystalline and an amorphous phase. The crystalline phase could have the desired perovskite structure. To have mesoporous TiO 2 as substrate seem to enhance a more crystalline structured material. All the materials seem to have formed some new structures because the pure reactants {{does not seem to be}} present, exceptions could be P 1 and T 1 that contained AuI. The change of cation from methylamine to cesium though results in a shift of the peak positions because of the change of cation size as in [20], but the structure is most likely the same. Raman spectroscopy indicate that there is a change in structure, some new bond being present, when increasing the methylamine ratio for the presumed methylammonium silver bismuth iodide perovskites. This concerns materials T 5, T 6, T 7 with increasing ratio of methylamine. This new bond is most pronounced in T 7 where the methylamine content is the highest. Both Silver and bismuth iodide bonds seem to be present and cannot be coupled to be the pure reactants recrystallizing and some new bonds of these are present in all materials to some extent. The organic bond vibration has low intensity and might indicate that there is not so much organic cation present in the product and thus the probability of having the desired product anion decreases. The solar cells made with Spiro-OMeTAD were 700 - 4000 times more efficient than those made with Sulphur polymer HTM. Solar cells made with Spiro-OMeTAD as HTM gives slightly higher efficiency when increasing the methylammonium cation ratio. For cesium as cation the combined metal cation constellation with bismuth and silver gives a little higher efficiency than bismuth alone. Methylammonium as cation gives a higher efficiency than cesium. Solar cells made with Sulphur polymer HTM show approximately 3 - 30 times higher efficiency with methylammonium as cation compared to cesium as cation. HTM material seem to affect the perovskite material making some of the cells completely transparent and some of them paler, water in the solvent chlorobenzene can be a possible explanation. The transparency can be the reason for the low efficiency obtained for the solar cells. Also the measurement methodology of these solar cells can also have been false, measuring the contacts, and the etching procedure could be another source of this. The solar cells had quite low efficiencies compared to [20], although same presumed material and procedure has been used and thus there might be something wrong in the accuracy of the manufacturing. The cells should probably been made several times and possible sources of error should be analyzed and corrected for. The materials were all relatively conductive. P 1 gave the highest conductivity, almost three times higher than for methylammonium lead iodide that has a conductivity of 1, 1 x 10 - 4 s/cm [3]. Increasing the methylammonium ratio gave an increase of the conductivity both with bismuth and silver as metal cations and silver alone. The increase of the methylammonium ratio might result in a new structure formed which has lattice planes that are more conductive. A change of gold to silver for the trimethylsulfonium iodide materials gave a large decrease in conductivity. The materials have different absorption curves meaning that they have different bandgaps and this indicates differences in structure. The bandgaps of all materials are indirect contrary to what is proven to be the case for perovskites that are believed to have direct bandgaps in general. To have indirect bandgaps requires a shift in momentum in the electronic transitions and is not as beneficial as having direct bandgaps. Compared to methylammonium lead iodide that has a direct bandgap of 1, 6 eV, the bandgaps are at least 0, 5 eV higher and range between 2, 2 - 2, 36 eV. P 1 had a low bandgap of 1, 6 eV meaning it absorbs a wide range of wavelengths. The conductivity does not seem to be the obstacle and the cells that are not transparent absorb light. It is highly possible that the low solar cell performance, at least to a certain extent, has to do with the production process. The low scan rate could also affect the low efficiencies and HTM Spiro-OMeTAD should be used. Currently the efficiency of the perovskite materials with silver/bismuth, gold/bismuth and silver are too low, and not able to substitute lead in the perovskite structure solar cells. Neither trimethylsulfonium gold or silver iodide cells nor cesium perovskites have enough efficiency at present. The conductivities for the materials are promising and the materials that are not completely transparent absorb light. Strävan att utveckla effektivare solceller och så miljövänliga som möjligt är drivkrafterna för det här arbetet. För att uppnå detta krävs forskning för att förbättra förståelsen för vilka mekanismer och parametrar som styr hur väl solcellerna fungerar. Det är nödvändigt att ta fram nya material, då de nuvarande brister i stabilitet, de är framförallt känsliga för vatten, temperatur och UV-strålning. I det här arbetet är syftet att byta ut bly (Pb 2 +), som är giftig och kopplad till hälsorisker, i den organiska metall halid (OMH) perovskit strukturen. Detta görs med guld eller silver i kombination med vismut och silver självt. Även trimetylsulfonium- guld eller silver undersöks. Metylammonium katjonen substitueras också mot cesium. Perovskit material absorberar både ljus och transporterar laddningar i solceller. Material baserade på AuI/AgI, BiI 3 och CH 3 NH 3 I and AuI/AgI och [Me 3 S]I and AgI, BiI 3 and CsI syntetiserades. Dessa analyserades, med XRD på dels ett substrat av tunn film och dels ett mesoporöst och Raman spektroskopi, för att bestämma strukturen på materialet och bindningar. J-V mätningar utfördes för att se hur materialen fungerade som solceller. Efter detta utfördes mätningar av konduktiviteten och absorptions parametrar bestämdes genom ett elektriskt konduktivitetstest respektive UV-vis absorptions spektroskopi. XRD mätningarna indikerar att perovskit strukturen kan ha erhållits eftersom spektrumen överensstämmer med de i [20], framförallt för T 3, T 5 och T 6, Cs 1 och Cs 2. I T 7 bildas någon ny struktur. Vismut skulle kunna vara delvis utbytt mot silver som metalkatjon. Proven är relativt amorfa, men uppvisar kristallina toppar och produkten skulle kunna vara en blandning av en kristallin och amorf fas, där den kristallina fasen skulle kunna ha den eftersträvade perovskit strukturen. Mesoprös TiO 2 som substrat verkar öka graden av kristallinitet hos materialen. Samtliga material verkar ha bildat någon ny struktur eftersom reaktanterna i sin rena form inte verkar finnas. Undantag skulle kunna vara P 1 och T 1, vilka innehåller AuI. Bytet av katjon från metylammonium mot cesium resulterar i ett skifte av topparna troligen beroende av skillnaden i storlek mellan katjonerna, liksom påvisas i [20], men strukturen är förmodligen densamma. Raman spektroskopin indikerar en förändring i strukturen, någon ny bindning finns, hos materialen när metylammonium andelen ökas för de förmodade metylammonium silver vismut jodid perovskiterna. Detta gäller materialen T 5, T 6, T 7, där andelen metylammonium ökar. Den nya bindningen är mest uttalade i T 7, där metylammonium andelen är den högsta. Både silver och vismut jodid bindningar verkar finnas och kan inte kopplas till att de rena reaktanterna har rekristalliserats och nya bindningar av dessa finns i alla material till en viss grad. Den organiska bindningens vibration har låg intensitet och kan tyda på att det inte finns så mycket organisk katjon i produkten och således minskar sannolikheten att ha den eftersträvade anjon produkten. Solcellerna gjorda med Spiro-OMeTAD var 700 - 4000 gånger mer effektiva än dom gjorda med Svavel polymer HTM. För solcellerna gjorda med Spiro-OMeTAD som HTM ger en ökning av metylammonium katjon andelen en ökad effektivitet. För cesium som katjon med den kombinerade metalkatjon konstellationen med vismut och silver, blir effektiviteten högre än om vismut är metalkatjon självt. Metylammonium som katjon ger en högre effektivitet än cesium. Solceller gjorda med Svavel polymer HTM visar ungefär 3 - 30 gånger högre effektivitet med metylammonium som katjon jämfört med cesium som katjon. HTM materialet verkar påverka perovskit materialet och göra några av cellerna helt transparenta och de andra blekare. Klor <b>benzen</b> användes som lösningsmedel och denna kan ha innehållit vatten och kan vara orsaken till färgskiftningen. Detta kan vara orsaken till den låga verkningsgraden som erhölls för solcellerna. En annan möjlig förklaring skulle kunna vara metoden för mätningarna. Denna kan ha varit felaktig, då kontakten troligen har varit det som har mätts och etsningsprocessen skulle kunna vara en orsak till detta. Solcellerna uppvisar ganska låg effektivitet i jämförelse med [20], trots att samma material och procedur har använts och således kan det vara något fel i precisionen av framställningen. Cellerna skulle förmodligen gjorts om ett antal gånger och möjliga felkällor borde utretts och åtgärdats. Materialen var överlag relativt konduktiva. P 1 gav den högsta konduktiviteten, nära tre gånger högre än metylammonium bly jodid, som har en konduktivitet på 1, 1 x 10 - 4 s/cm [3]. En ökning av andelen metylammonium gav en ökning av konduktiviteten både med vismut och silver som metalkatjon och silver självt. Ökningen av andelen metylammonium skulle kunna resultera i ett en ny struktur uppkommer som har plan som är mer konduktiva. Utbytet av guld mot silver för trimetylsulfonium jodid materialen gav en markant sänkning av konduktiviteten. Materialen har olika absorptionskurvor vilket innebär att de har olika bandgap och detta indikerar olikheter i strukturen. Bandgapen för alla material är indirekta, trots att bandgapen för perovskiter i regel är direkta. Att ha indirekta bandgap kräver ett skifte i momentum i de elektroniska energiöverföringarna och är inte så fördelaktigt som att ha direkta bandgap. I jämförelse med metylammonium bly jodid, som har ett direkt bandgap på 1, 6 eV, är bandgapen minst 0, 5 eV högre och varierar mellan 2, 2 - 2, 36 eV. P 1 hade ett lågt värde på bandgapet, 1, 6 eV, vilket innebär absorption av ett brett spektrum av våglängder. Konduktiviteten verkar inte vara den faktor som är orsaken till den låga effektiviteten hos solcellerna och de celler som inte är transparenta absorberar ljus. Det är högst troligt att den låga effektiviteten har sin förklaring, åtminstone delvis, i produktionsprocessen för solcellerna. Den relativt låga skanningshastigheten kan också vara en orsak för den låga effektiviteten och HTM Spiro-OMeTAD bör användas. I dagsläget är effektiviteten för perovskitmaterialen med silver/vismut, guld/vismut och silver för låg och har inte möjlighet substituera bly i perovskit solceller. Inte heller trimetylsulfonium guld eller silver jodid cellerna och inte heller cesium perovskiternas effektivitet räcker till i dagsläget. Konduktiviteten för materialen är lovande och materialen som inte är transparenta absorberar ljus...|$|E
