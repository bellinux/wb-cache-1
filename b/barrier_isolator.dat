50|$|<b>Barrier</b> <b>isolator</b> is {{a general}} term that {{includes}} two types of devices: isolators and restricted access barriers (RABS). Both are devices that provide a physical and aerodynamic (air overpressure) barrier between the external clean room environment and a work process. The isolator design is the more dependable of the two barrier design choices, as it prevents contamination hazards by achieving a more comprehensive separation of the processing environment from the surrounding facility. Nonetheless, both Isolator and RABS designs are contemporary approaches developed over the last 35 years and a great advancement over designs of the 1950s-70s that were far more prone to microbial contamination problems.|$|E
50|$|This is {{achieved}} by utilizing a split-architecture design that puts part of the <b>barrier</b> in an <b>isolator</b> card located in the safe area (power supply rack) & the other part {{in each of the}} spurs of field-mounted device couplers/segment. The <b>barrier</b> in the <b>isolator</b> allows 350 mA to be run through the segment up to the Spur/junction Box through trunk cable. Since infallible resistors are used, devices from Zone 0/1 or 2 can be direct connected. Having 350 mA, now allows users to power up to 16 Fieldbus devices (20 mA each) at 500 m while retaining intrinsic safety.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this randomized, prospective and controlled {{study was to investigate}} the ability of a closed-system transfer device (CSTD; BD-Phaseal) to reduce the occupational exposure of two isolators to 10 cytotoxic drugs and compare to standard compounding devices. The 6 -month study started with the opening of a new compounding unit. Two isolators were set up with 2 workstations each, one to compound with standard devices (needles and spikes) and the other using the Phaseal system. Drugs were alternatively compounded in each isolator. Sampling involved wiping three surfaces (gloves, window, worktop), before and after a cleaning process. Exposure to ten antineoplastic drugs (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, dacarbazine, 5 -FU, methotrexate, gemcitabine, cytarabine, irinotecan, doxorubicine and ganciclovir) was assessed on wipes by LC-MS/MS analysis. Contamination rates were compared using a Chi 2 test and drug amounts by a Mann-Whitney test. Significance was defined for p< 0. 05. Overall contamination was lower in the "Phaseal" isolator than in the "Standard" isolator (12. 24 % vs. 26. 39 %; p < 0. 0001) although it differed according to drug. Indeed, the contamination rates of gemcitabine were 49. 3 and 43. 4 % (NS) for the Standard and Phaseal isolators, respectively, whereas for ganciclovir, they were 54. 2 and 2. 8 % (p< 0. 0001). Gemcitabine amounts were 220. 6 and 283. 6 ng for the Standard and Phaseal isolators (NS), and ganciclovir amounts were 179. 9 and 2. 4 ng (p< 0. 0001). This study confirms that using a CSTD may significantly decrease the chemical contamination of <b>barrier</b> <b>isolators</b> compared to standard devices for some drugs, although it does not eliminate contamination totally...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Barrier</b> and <b>Isolator</b> {{designs are}} used {{throughout}} the industries, from sterile injectable drug filling to cytotoxic sterile drug compounding to electronics manufacturing to orange juice filling. Pharmaceutical industry and pharmacy compounding isolators are used for maintaining sterility of a drug, {{and that is the}} focus of this article. This type of strict design and control is important when producing sterile medicines because consumers receiving injections, surgical irrigants, or other [...] "parenterally"-administered drugs are often highly vulnerable to infection. As a result, contaminated drugs have caused grave (e.g., permanent injury, death) consequences for the consumer. The sterility of other dosage forms, such as ophthalmics, is similarly important, as blindness or partial loss of vision has occurred due to intrinsically contaminated eye medications.|$|R
