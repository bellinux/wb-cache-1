Before this discovery, there were drugs that had been found that demonstrated some type of influence on the nervous system. In the 1930s, French scientists began working with a compound called phenothiazine in the hope of synthesizing a drug that would be able to combat malaria. Though this drug showed very little hope in the use against malaria-infected individuals, it was found to have sedative effects along with what appeared to be beneficial effects toward patients with Parkinson’s disease. This black <b>box</b> <b>method,</b> wherein an investigator would administer a drug and examine the response without knowing how to relate drug action to patient response, was the main approach to this field, until, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, scientists were able to identify specific neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine (involved in the constriction of blood vessels and the increase in heart rate and blood pressure), dopamine (the chemical whose shortage is involved in Parkinson’s disease), and serotonin (soon to be recognized as deeply connected to depression). In the 1950s, scientists also became better able to measure levels of specific neurochemicals in the body and thus correlate these levels with behavior. The invention of the voltage clamp in 1949 allowed for the study of ion channels and the nerve action potential. These two major historical events in neuropharmacology allowed scientists not only to study how information is transferred from one neuron to another but also to study how a neuron processes this information within itself.|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} {{machine learning}} methods, ranging from simpler interpretable techniques to complex (non-linear) “black-box” approaches, for automated diagnosis of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Methods: Data from healthy subjects and patients diagnosed with AMD or other retinal diseases were collected during routine visits via an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. Patients’ attributes included demographics and, for each eye, presence/absence of major AMD-related clinical signs (soft drusen, retinal pigment epitelium, defects/ pigment mottling, depigmentation area, subretinal haemorrhage, subretinal fluid, macula thickness, macular scar, subretinal fibrosis). Interpretable techniques known as white <b>box</b> <b>methods</b> including logistic regression and decision trees {{as well as}} less interpreitable techniques known as black <b>box</b> <b>methods,</b> such as support vector machines (SVM), random forests and AdaBoost, were used to develop models (trained and validated on unseen data) to diagnose AMD. The gold standard was confirmed diagnosis of AMD by physicians. Sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) {{were used to assess}} performance. Results: Study population included 487 patients (912 eyes). In terms of AUC, random forests, logistic regression and adaboost showed a mean performance of (0. 92), followed by SVM and decision trees (0. 90). All machine learning models identified soft drusen and age as the most discriminating variables in clinicians’ decision pathways to diagnose AMD. C Conclusions: Both black-box and white <b>box</b> <b>methods</b> performed well in identifying diagnoses of AMD and their decision pathways. Machine learning models developed through the proposed approach, relying on clinical signs identified by retinal specialists, could be embedded into EHR to provide physicians with real time (interpretable) support...|$|R

50|$|The Cigar <b>Box</b> <b>Method</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} by Olivier van Lieshout and Orlando van Geuns, and is actively being used by agro-entrepreneurs worldwide. Recent examples are from EBRD-sponsored projecys in Morocco, Ukraine, Egypt, Montenegro and Bosnia as well from ITC-sponsored projects in Romania, Armenia, Central Asia, Bangladesh, Senegal, Guinea, Benin, Kenya, Tanzania, Jamaica and Argentina. The method derived its name from Dutch pioneers in the 17th Golden Century who were discussing foreign business deals while sipping coffee and smoking a cigar. When they needed to make quick business calculations, they often used the bottom side of the cigar box to convince investors about the profitability of their business ideas in a quick, concise and convincing manner..|$|E
50|$|The {{method was}} first used in 1999 as an {{analytical}} tool during a course on foreign direct investment (FDI) at the Wageningen University. It analyzed the suitability, including a risk analysis and potential benefits, of specific agricultural production processes for foreign investors. Between 1999 and 2012 over 180 students were trained {{in the use of}} the Cigar <b>Box</b> <b>Method.</b> It has since developed into a fully fledged business analysis tool with multiple purposes and used by various targets groups: as analytical tool for foreign investors and bankers, as business planning tool for fruit and vegetable processing factories and business development service providers. An adapted version for women entrepreneurs in Africa has been developed recently. The method is described in the Agribusiness Handbook for Fruit and Vegetable Processing published by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO).

50|$|In {{its initial}} test, the risk box {{was found to}} be 87% up to 94.3% {{accurate}} in predicting five periods prior to the event, with a Type II error (false positives) of 3% (Bahiraie et al., 2009a, 2009b, 2009c, 2010). That is a self-reported measure, reporting on the performance of the estimated Risk Box in the sample that it was estimated. Since this method is based on the indicators and main issue is to solve the problems occurs with them, there are many applications of this method in Finance, Engineering, Aerospace, Aviation, Social Sciences and any field which concern some kind of indicators. According to provided properties of new Risk <b>Box</b> <b>method</b> and better numerical results in compare to other studies, it is strongly suggested the use of this new methodology for analysis, which provided a conceptual and complimentary methodological solution to many of problems {{associated with the use of}} indicators. Alternatively, the Risk Box can be employed as a tool of analysis in providing a crucial first stage for analysing studies associated with changes in risk patterns, in particular those assumed to be linked with finance and engineering. The adaptability of our proposed methodology is emphasised by its applicability for any number of years on sectoral or cross-country studies.|$|E
50|$|The Switching Neural Network {{approach}} {{was developed in}} the 1990s to overcome the drawbacks of the most commonly used machine learning methods. In particular, black <b>box</b> <b>methods,</b> such as multilayer perceptron and support vector machine, had good accuracy but could not provide deep insight into the studied phenomenon. On the other hand, decision trees were able to describe the phenomenon but often lacked accuracy. Switching Neural Networks made use of Boolean algebra to build sets of intelligible rules able to obtain very good performance. In 2014, an efficient version of Switching Neural Network was developed and implemented in the Rulex suite with the name Logic Learning Machine. Also a LLM version devoted to regression problems was developed.|$|R
