40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effect of aging {{conditions}} (dry-aging vs. wet-aging) and time (0, 21, 42 and 63 days) on tenderness, color and lipid stability of <b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>beef.</b> Three longissimus dorsi of Belgian Blue cows were dry- or wet-aged for up to 63 days at 2 °C. At different times, part of these samples was cut into steaks, vacuum packaged and stored during 4 days at 4 °C + 8 days at 8 °C. The following parameters were evaluated at different intervals: pH, tenderness (Warner–Bratzler peak shear force), color (CIE L*a*b*), myoglobin oxidation (K/S 572 :K/S 525 ratio) and lipid oxidation (TBARS). The sensitivity of samples to pigment oxidation was influenced by the packaging during display. Aging time and packaging during display influenced lipid oxidation. Twenty-one days of aging allowed to achieve the maximum tenderness observed and would be compatible with a subsequent 12 -day display under vacuum. A 12 -day display period under shrinkable film is largely beyond the shelf life of meat under this condition. This study contributes new knowledge about <b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>beef</b> behavior when it is wet or dry aged.

40|$|In the double-muscled <b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>beef</b> breed, withers {{height and}} hearth girth are {{routinely}} measured. This is mainly {{done to prevent}} a decrease in growth potential when selecting for increased muscular conformation. The muscular conformation itself is subjectively scored. It was questioned if additional body measurements may improve the accuracy of estimating live weight and whether some of these body measurements may yield information for evaluating the muscular conformation hence the slaughter value of a live animal. It was found that hearth girth and shoulder width have a high correlation with the live weight of slaughter bulls. The width of the hind quarters and withers height are good estimators as well. Models combining these different traits to estimate live weight have reliability up to 83 %. Shoulder width and width of the hind quarters are a good reflection {{of the value of}} the slaughter bull, which is expressed as Euro per kg cold carcass weight. The withers height is negatively correlated (r = - 0. 40) with the muscular conformation of the slaughter bulls. Hearth girth has no clear relation with the muscular conformation. The four body traits, withers height, hearth girth, shoulder width and width of hind quarters are interesting traits related to economical traits in the double-muscled <b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>beef</b> breed.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the differences in biochemical, sensorial and quality characteristics of retail beef in Belgium. Four types of <b>beef</b> (<b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> double-muscled, Limousin, Irish and Argentine) and two different muscles (longissimus lumborum and semimembranosus) were bought at the retail level and compared with regard to colour, shear force, collagen content, fatty acid analysis, taste panel evaluation as well as flavour analysis. <b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> and Limousin <b>beef</b> had a paler colour, lower collagen and intramuscular fat contents. Fatty acid profiles were significantly different between the four types, with significantly higher PUFA/SFA and n- 6 /n- 3 ratios for Belgiam <b>Blue</b> and Limousin <b>beef</b> compared to Argentine and Irish beef. There were significant differences between the meat types for taste panel tenderness and shear force, however both measurements did not fully correspond. Flavour analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as well as sensory analysis demonstrated that Irish and Argentine beef had a higher flavour intensity related to higher contents of volatile compounds. Differences in tenderness and flavour between the meat types were probably affected by differences in ageing time, related to import vs local production of meat. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|<b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> (BB) <b>beef</b> cattle is {{particularly}} prone to selenium (Se) deficiency {{due to the}} poor Se content of soil and roughages on rearing farms and the higher requirements of this hypermuscled breed. The goal of this trial was to compare the effects of different forms and concentrations of Se supplementation on Se status, health and performance in 60 pregnant Se-deficient BB cows. Cows were allocated to 3 experimental groups receiving selenized-yeast at 0. 5 ppm Se on total ration (Y-Se 0. 5), Na-selenite at 0. 5 ppm Se on total ration (Na-Se 0. 5) and Na-selenite at 0. 1 ppm Se on total ration (Na-Se 0. 1), respectively. Cows were supplemented from 2 months before calving until 2 months after calving. Data on performance, health and Se status of the dams and their calves were analyzed using a linear model, least squares means and logistic regression. At {{the end of the}} study, plasmatic Se (pSe) was significantly higher (P 0. 1). At the same dosage, Y-Se conferred better Se status in both dams and their calves than did Na-Se. Requirement of 0. 1 ppm Se seems to be insufficient in BB to optimise health and performance. Regarding health status and ADG in calves, Y-Se seems also to result in better performance.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} was to study the effect of duration and temperature of previous vacuum-packed (VP) storage on the microbiological quality of <b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> (BB) <b>beef</b> packed in high-oxygen atmosphere. VP striploins from bulls (B) and cows (C) were stored at − 1 °C and + 4 °C for up to 80 days. These meats were subsequently repackaged under modified atmosphere (MA) – 70 % O 2 / 30 % CO 2 – at different times, and stored 2 d at + 4 °C and 5 d at + 8 °C. The average initial counts in VP meats were 3. 6 log CFU/cm² (B) and 2. 7 log CFU/cm² (C) for total viable count (TVC) at + 22 °C; < 2. 0 log CFU/cm² (B and C) for lactic ac id bacteria (LAB) at + 22 °C; 1. 1 log CFU/cm² (B) and 1. 3 log CFU/cm² (C) for Enterobacteriaceae at + 30 °C and < 1. 0 log CFU/cm² (B and C) for Pseudomonas spp. and Brochothrix thermosphacta. During the first 40 days of VP storage, temperature had a striking influence on microbial growth. The maximum count differences between storage temperatures were obtained at the 20 th day of storage: 2. 7 log CFU/cm² (B) and 2. 9 log CFU/cm² (C) for TVC, 4. 0 log CFU/cm² (B and C) for LAB and 3. 6 log CFU/cm² (B and C) for Enterobacteriaceae. The difference in TVC between temperatures at the 20 th day tended to disappear once the meats were repacked under MA and stored during seven days. Conversely, the difference in LAB and Enterobacteriaceae counts tended to be maintained after MA repackaging, showing that duration and temperature of VP storage had influence on microbiological quality of BB meat subsequently stored in high-oxygen atmosphere. Moreover, chilling at temperatures {{very close to the}} freezing point of meat during VP storage, which has already showed innumerous advantages for physicochemical quality of meat, was capital to maintain the microbiological quality of BB fresh meat during subsequent MA-packed storage.

40|$|The <b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>beef</b> cattle is {{well known}} for its double muscling {{phenotype}} resulting from fixation of a deletion in the myostatin gene. Since this fixation, further intensive selection for muscular development has been particularly succesful. This response to selection might be due to fixation of more genetic variants increasing muscular development. In the present study, we search for selective sweeps in the Belgian Blue genome which might result from the fixation of such variants. To that end we used data from 593 sires genotyped with the BovineHD SNP array. In addition, we used the Belgian Blue dual purpose and the Holstein breeds as controls. We first performed scans for regions of complete homozygosity resulting from fixation. Large fixed regions were found around major genes known to be fixed in the Belgian Blue cattle breed (MSTN, PLAG 1 and MC 1 R) but no other regions of the same magnitude was found. Among the smaller identified regions, only few of them were unique to the Belgian Blue breed. Statistical tests based on long range haplotype information were also implemented, revealing large regions in the genome of reduced haplotype homozygosity specific to the Belgian Blue breed. Some of these regions corresponded to known major genes (MSTN, roan locus, PLAG 1 or MC 1 R) while other regions were new. To determine whether these regions might be the result of selection for muscular development, we performed association studies for muscular development. None of the identified QTL matched with the regions of reduced haplotype homozygosity and the largest QTLs did not presented evidence of strong selective sweeps. These results suggest that the response to selection for muscular development in <b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>beef</b> cattle is probably the result of polygenic selection...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the progeny of Holstein–Friesian cows, sired by AA and BB bulls of low (L) and high (H) EPDCWT for performance and carcass traits. A total of 118 spring-born male progeny from 20 (9 AA and 11 BB) sires (8 L and 12 H) were managed together from shortly after birth to about 19 months of age. They were then assigned to one of two mean slaughter weights (560 kg (light) or 620 kg (heavy)). Following slaughter, carcasses were graded for conformation class and fat class, the 6 th to 10 th ribs joint was dissected as an indicator of carcass composition, and samples of subcutaneous fat and musculus longissimus were subjected to Hunterlab colour measurements. A sample of m. longissimus was also chemically analysed. Slaughter and carcass weights per day of age for AAL, AAH, BBL and BBH were 747, 789, 790 and 805 (s. e. 10. 5) g, and 385, 411, 427 and 443 (s. e. 4. 4) g, respectively. Corresponding carcass weight, kill-out proportion, carcass conformation class (scale 1 to 5) and carcass fat class (scale 1 to 5) values were 289, 312, 320 and 333 (s. e. 4. 0) kg, 516, 522, 542 and 553 (s. e. 3. 5) g/kg, 2. 5, 2. 4, 3. 0 and 3. 1 (s. e. 0. 10), and 3. 4, 3. 5, 2. 9 and 2. 8 (s. e. 0. 11). There were few breed type 3 genetic merit interactions. Delaying slaughter date increased slaughter weight, carcass weight and all measures of fatness. It also reduced the proportion of carcass weight in the hind quarter and the proportions of bone and muscle in the ribs joint. None of these effects accompanied the increase in carcass weight due to higher EPDCWT. It is concluded that BB have superior production traits to AA. Selection of sires for higher EPDCWT increases growth rate, kill-out proportion and carcass weight of progeny with little effect on carcass or muscle traits.

40|$|Inbreeding {{results from}} the mating of related {{individuals}} and has negative consequence because it brings together deleterious variants in one individual. Inbreeding is associated with recessive diseases and reduced production or fitness. Until recently inbreeding was estimated with genealogical data, which have some limitations. Genomic estimates of inbreeding can now be obtained thanks to new technologies. Methods based on genomic relationships assume either that identical-by-state markers are identical-by-descent (IBD) or correct for the allele frequencies estimated in a « founder generation ». Similarly, with runs of homozygosity (ROH), the hypothesis is that stretches of homozygous markers longer than a determined threshold (measured in number of markers or in Mb) are IBD. Although sequencing data are more informative, most of the recent studies used genotyping data. Due to high genotyping errors rates with sequencing technologies, ROH are difficult to use on such data. We herein describe an original method to model inbreeding along chromosomes. It relies on a hidden Markov model that determines locally whether a segment is inbred and gives a measure of inbreeding's age. The method uses a function modeling the probability to observe a genotype in an inbred segments. It is well suited for sequencing data because the function incorporates genotyping errors and uncertainty associated with low or moderate coverage. We first determine the properties of our new method with different simulation scenarii.

40|$|Abstract Background Mortality and {{morbidity}} {{are hardly}} {{documented in the}} white veal industry, despite high levels of antimicrobial drug use and resistance. The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine the causes and epidemiology of morbidity and mortality in dairy, beef and crossbred white veal production. A total of 5853 calves, housed in 15 production cohorts, were followed during one production cycle. Causes of mortality were determined by necropsy. Morbidity was daily recorded by the producers. Results The total mortality risk was 5, 3 % and was significantly higher in beef veal production compared to dairy or crossbreds. The main causes of mortality were pneumonia (1. 3 % of the calves at risk), ruminal disorders (0. 7 %), idiopathic peritonitis (0. 5 %), enterotoxaemia (0. 5 %) and enteritis (0. 4 %). <b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>beef</b> calves were more likely to die from pneumonia, enterotoxaemia and arthritis. Detection of bovine viral diarrhea virus at necropsy was associated with chronic pneumonia and pleuritis. Of the calves, 25. 4 % was treated individually and the morbidity rate was 1. 66 cases per 1000 calf days at risk. The incidence rate of respiratory disease, diarrhea, arthritis and otitis was 0. 95, 0. 30, 0. 11 and 0. 07 cases per 1000 calf days at risk respectively. Morbidity peaked in the first three weeks after arrival and gradually declined towards the end of the production cycle. Conclusions The present study provided insights into the causes and epidemiology of morbidity and mortality in white veal calves in Belgium, housed in the most frequent housing system in Europe. The necropsy findings, identified risk periods and differences between production systems can guide both veterinarians and producers towards the most profitable and ethical preventive and therapeutic protocols. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground : Inbreeding {{coefficients}} can {{be estimated}} either from pedigree data or from genomic data, and with genomic data, they are either global or local (when the linkage map is used). Recently, we developed a new hidden Markov model (HMM) that estimates probabilities of homozygosity-by-descent (HBD) at each marker position and automatically partitions autozygosity in multiple age-related classes (based {{on the length of}} HBD segments). Our objectives were to: (1) characterize inbreeding with our model in an intensively selected population such as the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Beef</b> (BBB) cattle breed; (2) compare the properties of the model at different marker densities; and (3) compare our model with other methods. Results :When using 600  K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the inbreeding coefficient (probability of sampling an HBD locus in an individual) was on average 0. 303 (ranging from 0. 258 to 0. 375). HBD-classes associated to historical ancestors (with small segments ≤  200  kb) accounted for 21. 6 % of the genome length (71. 4 % of the total length of the genome in HBD segments), whereas classes associated to more recent ancestors accounted for only 22. 6 % of the total length of the genome in HBD segments. However, these recent classes presented more individual variation than more ancient classes. Although inbreeding coefficients obtained with low SNP densities (7 and 32  K) were much lower (0. 060 and 0. 093), they were highly correlated with those obtained at higher density (r =  0. 934 and 0. 975, respectively), indicating that they captured most of the individual variation. At higher SNP density, smaller HBD segments are identified and, thus, more past generations can be explored. We observed very high correlations between our estimates and those based on homozygosity (r =  0. 95) or on runs-of-homozygosity (r =  0. 95). As expected, pedigree-based estimates were mainly correlated with recent HBD-classes (r =  0. 56). Conclusions : Although we observed high levels of autozygosity associated with small HBD segments in BBB cattle, recent inbreeding accounted for most of the individual variation. Recent autozygosity can be captured efficiently with low-density SNP arrays and relatively simple models (e. g., two HBD classes). The HMM framework provides local HBD probabilities that are still useful at lower SNP densities...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effect of two breeds (<b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> vs. Limousin) and {{previous}} vacuum storage time on color and lipid stability of meat packaged in high-oxygen atmosphere. Vacuum packaged striploins from <b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> and Limousin cows were stored at − 1 °C and + 4 °C for up to 60 days and analyzed. Part of these samples were repackaged under modified atmosphere – 70 % O 2 / 30 % CO 2 – at different times, stored 2 days at + 4 °C and 5 d at + 8 °C, and then analyzed. The following parameters were evaluated: color (CIE L*a*b*), metmyoglobin %, lipid oxidation (TBARS) and fat content. Color measurement and metmyoglobin % determination showed greater pigment stability in <b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> samples than in Limousin. <b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> also presented higher lipid stability (TBARS). A positive correlation between pigment oxidation and lipid oxidation was highlighted. The greater amount of fat in meat of Limousin could partially explain its higher sensitivity to oxidation. Nevertheless, other factors may be involved in oxidative stability such as metmyoglobin reducing activity and antioxidant capacity. An understanding of the oxidative processes and their interaction would provide a basis for explaining quality deterioration in meat and for developing strategies to maintain sensory qualities.

40|$|Six <b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> bulls (double-muscled type) and six Friesian bulls {{were offered}} a {{fattening}} diet for 34 weeks. Plasma samples were obtained {{once a week}} and also every 20 min over a 24 h period, 7 weeks before slaughter. No differences were observed between the breeds in plasma glucose, urea and free amino nitrogen concentrations, while creatinine was significantly higher in the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> bulls. Tri-iodothyronin, tetra-iodothyronin, insulin-like growth factor 1, insulin and testosterone concentrations were higher in the Holstein group. In contrast, the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> bulls appeared to produce more growth hormone. The slaughter weight, carcass weight, dressing percentage and proportion of lean meat were significantly higher in the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Blue</b> group. The characteristics of muscle mass (carcass weight, dressing percentage and proportion of lean meat) were positively correlated with creatinine and with the total peak area or peak amplitude of growth hormone. The insulin concentration was positively correlated with the proportion of adipose tissue in the carcass and negatively correlated with the proportion of muscle. There were no correlations between the carcass characteristics and insulin-like growth factor 1 or testosterone. No further information was provided when the ratios of the hormones were correlated with carcass characteristics. Peer reviewe...|$|R
