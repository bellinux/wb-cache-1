40|$|The authors {{construct}} {{a model of}} <b>customs</b> <b>unions</b> in which countries charge optimal tariffs. <b>Customs</b> <b>unions</b> internalize the externality that exists whenever two countries import the same good. Also, <b>customs</b> <b>unions</b> make several countries into one large unit with more market power. Big <b>customs</b> <b>unions</b> can improve their members' welfare relative to the free trade. The authors' model of <b>customs</b> <b>unions</b> separates the effects of tariff reduction {{from the effects of}} policy coordination. The movement from Nash equilibrium to a free trade association improves global resource allocations.

40|$|This paper explores a new {{dimension}} {{of the impact of}} <b>Customs</b> <b>Unions</b> on trade liberalization, largely ignored by the literature so far. That {{new dimension}} is the importance of timing of <b>Customs</b> <b>Unions.</b> I present a dynamic model in which the effects of <b>Customs</b> <b>Unions</b> differ depending on when they are formed. <b>Customs</b> <b>Unions</b> that happen in the later stages of trade liberalization are shown to be more likely to speed up that process. The trade liberalization framework is adapted from Staigers 1995 model of Gradual Trade Liberalization. After extending the model to allow for more than two countries, I introduce the formation of <b>Customs</b> <b>Unions.</b> I then show under which conditions <b>Customs</b> <b>Unions</b> speed up and under which conditions they slow down the trade liberalization process. These show that <b>Customs</b> <b>Unions</b> are more likely to speed up trade liberalization in later rounds. Also, the Bagwell and Staiger result that high discount factors tend to make <b>Customs</b> <b>Unions</b> more beneficial to trade liberalization is confirmed. 2 1...|$|R

40|$|Armenia {{is going}} to join the <b>Customs</b> <b>Union</b> of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia (the Eurasian <b>Customs</b> <b>Union)</b> in the coming months. The author uses partial-equilibrium model to {{investigate}} and calculate trade diversion, trade creation and net welfare effects of accession on the Armenian economy. The thesis concludes that the membership in the <b>customs</b> <b>union</b> would lead to welfare losses and negative static effects. The main reason is the pure trade diversion effect on Armenia resulting from the increased external tariff rate. Adopting the common external tariff of the Eurasian <b>Customs</b> <b>Union</b> would raise the prices of those imported goods which flow from outside the <b>customs</b> <b>union.</b> As the majority of Armenian imports come from outside the Eurasian <b>Customs</b> <b>Union,</b> the increase in import prices would carry high social costs for the Armenian consumers. In addition, the absence of shared border with the <b>customs</b> <b>union</b> member-states substantially diminishes the potential benefits from possible non-tariff barrier facilitation. Therefore, the thesis strongly recommends against the accession...|$|R
