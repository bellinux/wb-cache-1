25|$|The school uses {{an early}} example of all-glass curtain walling called the Hill System. Rather than use the common opaque, blue {{spandrel}} panels on the façade, Cadbury-Brown chose instead to just use glass panels. The {{corners of the}} building are glazed whilst {{the top of the}} curtain wall at the roof edge is neatly finished without a projecting edge (although the final detail was realised in felt rather than as designed in steel). Although the fireproof cladding for the columns behind make the <b>building</b> <b>frame</b> less visible, the building has been compared to those by Mies van de Rohe. The design has been considered comparable to the Eames House and Hunstanton School by Alison and Peter Smithson.|$|E
2500|$|FEMA {{suggested}} that fires {{in conjunction with}} damage resulting from the aircraft impacts were {{the key to the}} collapse of the towers. Thomas Eagar, Professor of Materials Engineering and Engineering Systems at MIT, described the fires as [...] "the most misunderstood part of the WTC collapse". This is because the fires were originally said to have [...] "melted" [...] the floors and columns. Jet fuel is essentially kerosene and would have served mainly to ignite very large, but not unusually hot, hydrocarbon fires. As Eagar said, [...] "The temperature of the fire at the WTC was not unusual, and it was most definitely not capable of melting steel." [...] This led Eagar, FEMA and others to focus on {{what appeared to be the}} weakest point of the structures, namely, the points at which the floors were attached to the <b>building</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{building}} had a [...] frontage on Cedar Glen Parkway, a [...] frontage on Ambleside Drive. The building's access road was set back [...] from Cedar Glen Parkway, and the structure's east wall [...] from Ambleside. Ample vacant {{land at the}} rear of the building provided privacy. The first floor of the Georgian Revival-style building's exterior was clad in Indiana limestone, with the upper floors consisting of exposed brick with limestone trim at the corners and around the doorways. The windows were trimmed with stone. The <b>building</b> <b>frame</b> was steel, with walls, floors, and the roof of reinforced concrete. The cornice was topped by a balustrade consisting of terra cotta balusters and a stone railing. Stone urns rested atop the balustrade. The structure's exterior and interior masonry walls were certified by the Cleveland Clay League as using locally sourced materials, fireproof, and attractive. The E-shaped {{building had}} a garden forecourt [...] deep and [...] long. The apartment complex itself consisted of a six-story central tower equipped with an elevator, and two four-story walk-up wings (e.g., equipped with stairs but no elevator). Each wing, each connection, and the central tower all had their own entrances. The building had an underground 40-car garage with internal staircases (so patrons did not have to exit the garage to reach the interior of the building).|$|E

50|$|The {{two common}} {{assumptions}} {{as to the}} behavior of a <b>building</b> <b>frame</b> are (1) that its beams are free to rotate at their connections or (2) that its members are so connected that the angles they make with each other do not change under load.

The AISC specifications recognize three basic frame types: Rigid Frame, Simple Frame, and Partially Restrained Frame.|$|E

40|$|The soil {{flexibility}} {{effect is}} generally ignored in seismic design of <b>building</b> <b>frames</b> {{and the design}} is carried out based on results of dynamic analysis considering fixed base condition. Flexibility of soil causes lengthening of lateral natural period due to overall decrease in lateral stiffness of the structure. Such lengthening of lateral natural period(T) may considerably alter the seismic response of the <b>building</b> <b>frames</b> resting on Raft foundation. Hence {{it is necessary to}} incorporate the flexibility of soil on which the foundation rests during analysis, such study being termed as Soil Structure Interaction. The present paper deals with dynamic behaviour of <b>building</b> <b>frames</b> asymmetric in plan with Raft footings under seismic forces incorporating soil-structure interaction. The analysis is carried out using FEM software SAP 2000 *V 14. The structure is idealized as 3 D space frame where in beam and column are modeled as 2 noded line elements with six degrees of freedom at each node and slabs are modeled as thin shell with four noded plate elements having six degrees of freedom at each node. The soil is modeled as equivalent springs with single(Winkler) and six degrees of freedom(Modified winkler) the stiffness of which varies with type of soil based on the properties, viz., dynamic shear modulus and poissons ratio of soil. The raft foundation for winkler and Modified Winkler are modeled as thin shells with four noded plate elements having 6 degrees of freedom at each node and is discritised, such that the aspect ratio of the elements are equal to one. The response in terms of fundamental Natural Period, Seismic Base Shear and Max. Lateral Displacement, for a variety of <b>building</b> <b>frames</b> with and without consideration of soil flexibility is compared to evaluate the contribution of soil structure interaction on <b>building</b> <b>frames.</b> Influence of of parameters such as different soil types (i. e, Soft, Medium and Stiff), different span lengths, number of bays and number of stories are considered in the parametric study for Zone V. It is found that the effect of soil flexibility on <b>building</b> <b>frames</b> appreciably alters the fundamental lateral natural period and seismic base shear of the system. Due to the effect of soil flexibility, the lateral natural period and seismic base shear increase with the decreasing stiffness of soil. It is also observed that the lateral period and base shear of the building increases with increase in number of bays. The Maximum lateral displacement increases with increase in number bays and stories. Â© 2013 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|R
