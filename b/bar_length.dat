2500|$|Pieces {{that demanded}} {{simultaneous}} execution of {{versions of the}} same music, i.e., contrapunctal canons, were written by several composers of the Franco-Flemish school in the late 15th and early 16th century, such as Josquin des Prez, Johannes Ockeghem or Pierre de la Rue. Ockeghem's Missa prolationum is famous for systematically exploring different ways of combining pairs of voices in mensural canons. In the example given below, from the first [...] "Kyrie" [...] of this mass, both upper voices sing the same notated line, one reading it as [...] "tempus imperfectum" [...] and the other as [...] "tempus perfectum". The two lower voices are similarly coupled with each other. Each of the four voices thus starts the piece in a different mensuration, leading to different <b>bar</b> <b>length</b> in the modern transcription. (The lower voices, which are written in prolatio maior, later shift to a meter where all semibreves are imperfected through black coloration, which means they end up having the same length as those of the upper voices after all.) ...|$|E

Thus, this network (designated as initial state or zero state in the following content) is transformed to an ellipsoidal geodesic network by scaling in x, y, and z directions with factors of 15 / 15, 11 / 15, and 12 / 15, respectively (designated as first state). The next step is to find a new node position on the current ellipsoidal surface that allows the <b>bar</b> <b>lengths</b> to “return” to the corresponding lengths of the geodesic network before transformation. To achieve this goal, the adaptive form-finding procedure is conducted, as presented in the following section.|$|R

In particular, we establish various limit theorems for the sum of <b>bar</b> <b>lengths</b> in the persistence barcode plot, a graphical descriptor of persistent homology. It then turns out that the growth rate of the sum of the <b>bar</b> <b>lengths</b> and the properties of the limiting processes all depend on the distance of the region of interest in R^d from the weak core, that is, the area in which random points are placed sufficiently densely to connect with one another.

The method considers {{the propagation of}} the expansion wave and shear wave in beam. The effect of beam height on elastic impact loads with different bar lengths and beam heights are investigated. With condition that the length of beam is longer {{than or equal to}} that of bar, the numerical solution shows that: when the <b>bar</b> <b>length</b> is constant, if the length of bar is shorter than the height of beam, the longer the bar, the bigger the peak value of impact force; the impact load curve consists of ascending and descending part basically; When the <b>bar</b> <b>length</b> is longer than or equal to beam height, the peak value of impact force is not related to the <b>bar</b> <b>length</b> and equal to that of bar with the same length as the beam height; the impact load curve is trapezium. The contact time is proportional to <b>bar</b> <b>length</b> and equal to the duration time of stress wave propagation in the bar for once return. If the <b>bar</b> <b>length</b> is constant, when <b>bar</b> <b>length</b> is shorter than beam height, the impact load is not related to beam height; when <b>bar</b> <b>length</b> longer than or equal to beam height, the peak value of impact force increases along with the beam height and approach to that of bar with the same length as the beam height...|$|E

For different types of projection onto sphere surface, geometry of geodesic domes is defined, using octahedron or icosahedron as a basic polyhedron. <b>Bar's</b> <b>length</b> and number of bars needed for structure are calculated for different divisions of polyhedron's sides. Solution for joints of metal geodesic dome is presented by using prefabricated elements. Described methods are used for calculation of <b>bar's</b> <b>length</b> for one case of geodesic dome. Some simplifications are also suggested for that case. How to draw geodesic domes and calculate vertex's coordinates in program Mathematica is described. Some kinds of different free form lattice shell structures are shown. Thesis also presents geometrical design of free form sphere dome, grid shell and geodesic dome which is projected onto ellipsoid's surface. In the end lattice shell structure is analyzed for two load cases: snow load and dead load. Using finite element method linear static analysis, buckling analysis, geometrical nonlinear analysis and modal analysis (structure analysis software SAP 2000 is used for analyses) are made.

40|$|Abstract. I {{have studied}} the {{relation}} between the global star formation activity and the bar structure in a sample of isolated barred galaxies. The star formation activity was quantified via the ratio between the IRAS fluxes at 25 µm and 100 µm. Two parameters were chosen to define the bar structure: the strength of the bar and the relative projected <b>bar</b> <b>length.</b> The strength of the bar was defined by ɛb = 10 (1 − b/a), where a and b are the projected semi-major and semi-minor bar axis. The relative <b>bar</b> <b>length</b> was defined as: 2 Lb/D 25, where Lb is one half of the projected total <b>bar</b> <b>length</b> and D 25 is the diameter of the 25 mag arcsec− 2 magnitude isophote in the B band. We found a strong correlation between the star formation activity and ɛb. The regression line is given by log(I 25 /I 100) =− 1. 81 + 0. 093 ɛb, with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9. The link is not so evident between the relative projected <b>bar</b> <b>length</b> and the star formation activity.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{third in a}} series, {{studying}} the optical properties of a sample of Seyfert galaxies. Here we present a homogeneous set of global (ellipticity, position angle, inclination, and total magnitude) and isophotal (semi-major axis and colour indices at 24 V mag/sq. arcsec) parameters of the galaxy sample. We find the following median corrected isophotal colour indices: B-Ic = 1. 9 mag/sq. arcsec and V-Ic = 1. 1 mag/sq. arcsec. A set of bar parameters - ellipticity, position angle, semi-major axis corresponding to the ellipticity maximum in the bar region, and length, are also reported; deprojection {{has been applied to}} the bar ellipticity, length, and relative length in terms of galaxy isophotal semi-major axis. Regarding <b>bar</b> <b>length</b> estimation, we use a method, based on the relation between the behaviour of the profiles and orbit analysis. The so estimated <b>bar</b> <b>length</b> tightly correlates with the semi-major axis, corresponding to the ellipticity maximum with a median ratio of the former to the latter of 1. 22. The median of the deprojected bar ellipticity, length, and relative length are 0. 39, 5. 44 kpc, and 0. 44, respectively. There is a correlation between the deprojected <b>bar</b> <b>length</b> and the corrected isophotal semi-major axis at 24 V mag/sq. arcsec.
