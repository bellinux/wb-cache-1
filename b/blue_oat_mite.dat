40|$|Abstract. Earth mites are {{a complex}} of related species {{introduced}} into Australia {{in the early part}} of last century that cause economic damage to crops, especially canola, and to pastures. A general method of chemical control aimed at interrupting the life cycle at the most effective stage, by spraying in the spring before the mites enter diapause, has recently been adopted for controlling earth mites, particularly the redlegged earth mite Halotydeus destructor (Tucker). Here we use paired-paddock treatments and field enclosures to test the effectiveness of this method on pest populations of H. destructor as well as on other pests over two seasons at multiple pasture sites in Victoria. Halotydeus destructor numbers at the start of the winter growing season were suppressed by up to 85 %, but this control level was not sustained. The numbers of H. destructor and other pests were similar to or higher than those in the unsprayed areas by spring. Spring spraying is, therefore, a useful means of suppressing H. destructor in early autumn, but its effects disappear relatively quickly over time in Victoria. This strategy also has little impact on the control of the <b>blue</b> <b>oat</b> <b>mite</b> Penthaleus major (Duges) and other phytophagous invertebrate pests...|$|E
40|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>oat</b> <b>mites</b> (BOM) (Penthaleus spp.) are {{species of}} earth mites which are major {{agricultural}} pests of southern Australia {{and other parts}} of the world, attacking various pasture, vegetable and crop plants. BOM were introduced from Europe and first recorded in New South Wales in 1921. Management of these mites in Australia has been complicated by the recent discovery of three distinct species of BOM, whereas prior research had assumed just a single species...|$|R

40|$|Aspergillus flavus K 49 {{secreted}} {{at least}} two xylanase activities when grown on a medium containing larch (wood) xylan as a sole carbon source. Enzyme activity was assayed using an agar medium containing Remazol Brilliant <b>Blue</b> R conjugated <b>oat</b> spelt xylan as substrate. Crude enzyme preparations were inhibited by Hg? 2, with an ED 50 of 17. 5 mM and maximum inhibition of 83 % at 50 mM. A concentrated sample of A. flavus K 49 xylanase preparation was subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a P- 30 column. A small protein peak coinciding with the major peak of xylanase activity was separated from the other secreted fungal proteins. An additional peak of xylanase activity was observed in fractions containing multiple fungal proteins.

40|$|AbstractThe {{complete}} {{nucleotide sequence}} of the single-stranded RNA genome of Maize rayado fino virus (MRFV), the type member of the genus Marafivirus, is 6305 nucleotides (nts) in length and contains two putative open reading frames (ORFs). The largest ORF (nt 97 – 6180) encodes a polyprotein of 224 kDa with sequence similarities at its N-terminus to the replication-associated proteins of other viruses with positive-strand RNA genomes and to the papainlike protease domain found in tymoviruses. The C-terminus of the 224 -kDa ORF also encodes the MRFV capsid protein. A smaller, overlapping ORF (nt 302 - 1561) encodes a putative protein of 43 kDa with unknown function but with limited sequence similarities to putative movement proteins of tymoviruses. The nucleotide sequence and proposed genome expression strategy of MRFV is most closely related to that of <b>oat</b> <b>blue</b> dwarf virus (OBDV). Unlike OBDV, MRFV RNA {{does not appear to}} contain a poly(A) tail, and it encodes a putative second overlapping open reading frame...|$|R
40|$|Abstract An undescribed virus with {{isometric}} {{particles and}} {{a diameter of}} ca. 30 nm was identified in diseased samples of wild and cultivated Rubus species and molecularly characterized. Its genome was 6, 463 nt, excluding the 30 -terminal poly(A) tail, and contained a single open reading frame coding for a 2, 035 -amino-acid-long precursor polypeptide (p 223). The amino terminal portion of p 223, identified as a replication-associated polyprotein, contained conserved motifs of methyltransferase, endopeptidase/protease, helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The carboxy terminus of the large polypeptide {{is involved in the}} formation of two viral coat protein subunits with deduced molecular masses of 23 and 21 kDa. Pairwise comparisons and phylogenetic analyses showed closest relationships of this virus with <b>oat</b> <b>blue</b> dwarf virus and citrus sudden death-associated virus, sharing levels of genome sequence conservation far below the species demarcation level established for tymovirids. Our data indicate that this virus, for which the name blackberry virus S (BlVS) is proposed, is a hitherto undescribed species of the genus Marafivirus, family Tymoviridae. A survey conducted in Mississippi, USA, has shown that BlVS is also present in cultivated Rubus germplasm. This work represents the first report of a marafivirus infecting small fruits.

40|$|Changes {{in organic}} {{composition}} of crop residues (soybean, radish, white lupine, <b>blue</b> lupine, black <b>oat</b> and mucuna) that are utilized in crop rotations in no-tillage farming {{systems in the}} southern part of Brazil were evaluated by analytical flash pyrolysis. The pyrolysis allowed the identification of five groups of compounds in the residues: guaiacyl moieties in lignin (Lg), syringyl moities in lignin (Ls), polysaccharide (Ps), chlorophyll (Chl) and fatty acid (Fa) derivatives. The decomposition rates of the plant residues ranged from 4. 7 to 5. 9 g kg- 1 day- 1, with a mean value of 5. 2 g kg- 1 day- 1, corresponding to a mean loss of 41 % (37 - 47 %) of the initial biomass after 80 days of incubation. The Ps and lignin contents were strongly affected by incubation; relative lignin content increased at the expense of polysaccharide derivatives. In the original samples, Ps was the principal group of organic compounds in green manure plant materials, with maximum values in blue and white lupine (67 %); after incubation, Ps fractions decreased by 26 - 51 % (average 40 %), with the greatest value observed with mucuna and the lowest in white lupine. In soybean plant material the Ps fraction decreased only by 9 %. Greater increases in relative lignin content were observed with Ls (156 %) than with Lg (59 %) derivatives, demonstrating that guaiacyl moieties are easier to biochemically degrade than syringyl moieties. A significant correlation between residue-weight loss and organic groups after 80 days incubation was only found with Ls. Plant materials showing a higher content of syringyl moieties after decomposition might aid in increasing soil organic matter. Flash pyrolysis was shown to be an adequate technique to follow the process of transformation of plant residues into stabilized soil organic matter. J. C.
