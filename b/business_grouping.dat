We argue that the culture in Japan causes institutions to have both a long-term focus and close relationships with management. Consistent with the first view, we find that herding in Japan occurs on a lower level than it does in the U. S., and that the subsequent short-run returns to herding seem to be unimportant. Consistent with the second view, we find that when herding does occur, it has a large impact on price movements, and the use of past information (feedback trading) on herding behavior seems only marginally important. Much of these findings are more pronounced for keiretsu firms. Lastly, the effects and behavior of institutional herding is dependent on the economic environment. ...|$|E

40|$|Chiang Mai is {{the second}} biggest city in Thailand. With its own history, this city has been {{represented}} as a culture city but many economic growths have been increasing at the same time. Many areas in the city are turning toward economic purposes, especially Nimmanhaemin District, which is currently well known as a business district for dining and entertainment spots where it was originally a planned area for single house real estate and had followed grid system planning following modern thought since 1980 s. The strong character of this district is in its street network which {{is related to the}} grid system and provides for communities on “Soi” (Thai, meaning alleys that connect to the main street). With rapidly economic development in the last 15 years, area uses on the Nimmanhaemin street network have been turning toward business purposes and have grown without direction or limits. The most invested in are residential and commercial uses. There can be found numbers of new apartments which were built into old residential areas. In addition, researchers have found conflicts and controversies between old residents and new communities which are permanently related to urban management such as traffic circulation, zoning, image of the city and community design. Because previous government strategies were lacking local input, analysis of existing communities’ relations is required. This research hypothesis is to posit sustainable communities which move forward with a “Community Drive” where cultural and creative activities create a balance between social relations (Existing residents and present <b>business</b> <b>grouping)</b> and business aims. Then, this research aims to integrate “Neighbourhood” into apartments which lack social interaction and public mind as a part of community. This research methodology identifies the relationship between existing residents and present business groups which refer to concerned theories; “The Production of Space” theory by Henri Lefebvre and “Neighbourhood” by Nicholas Patricios, which defines the “Neighbourhood”concept as a retrospective of physical design and social interaction.

40|$|Typical <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> {{are widely}} diversified into {{unrelated}} industries. Scholars have explained {{this as a}} consequence of institutional weaknesses and predicted that <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> would lose their effectiveness and increasingly refocus as institutional environments improve. In this dissertation, I suggest a new perspective on <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> by revisiting their hybrid nature and focusing on the fact that two different boundaries exist for <b>business</b> <b>group</b> member firms. I differentiate between group-level diversification and firm-level diversification and argue that they serve different purposes, which lead to divergent patterns of diversification. First, at the <b>business</b> <b>group</b> level, I question the appropriateness of applying the concept of relatedness to the diversification of a <b>business</b> <b>group.</b> Emphasizing the hybrid nature of the <b>business</b> <b>group,</b> I argue that its purpose of diversification may be more to provide the group?s member firms with critical resources than to obtain synergies from operating in related industries. Relying on the insights from the input-output model, I propose the idea that <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> are more likely to enter industries that have linkages to multiple other industries than to follow the relatedness criterion. I test the idea using the data of 30 major South Korean <b>business</b> <b>groups?</b> diversification from 1999 to 2008 and find an empirical support. Second, at the member firm level, I focus on the importance of group-level characteristics on member firms? diversification choices. Emphasizing economic incentives, I propose that the <b>business</b> <b>group</b> structure and relationships within it affect its member firms? strategic orientation and choices in ways that may satisfy the needs of both the controlling shareholders and minority shareholders. I theorize that the size, the degree of diversification, and the proportion of intragroup transaction of a <b>business</b> <b>group</b> would affect diversification choices of its member firms. Based on the data of 108 public member firms of 30 major South Korean <b>business</b> <b>groups,</b> I find empirical support for most of my hypotheses. The implication of my dissertation is that the <b>business</b> <b>group</b> may be not just a coping mechanism for underdeveloped institutions, but an organizational innovation that can work in any institutional environment...|$|R
