6000|$|... "Come!" [...] cried Carthoris. [...] "There {{is no time}} to be lost. Astok will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{with enough}} warriors to {{overpower}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> good mother,' said he. And {{three minutes}} later he placed a purse full of sequins in the old woman's hand.|$|E
60|$|DEARTH (with {{his sweet}} mournful smile). I shall <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> moment--probably.|$|R

60|$|LIZA [forcing {{a little}} smile for him through her vexation] Oh well, just to show there's no ill feeling. I'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> [She goes out].|$|E
6000|$|... "They will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> It {{is absurd}} to doubt either of them, Ducaine. Yet I shall keep silent. I have an idea. Agree to {{everything}} I say." ...|$|E
6000|$|GLORIA (annoyed). Mother will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> Phil. (Severely.) Please {{wait here}} for her. (She turns {{away to the}} window, where she stands looking out {{with her back to}} them.) ...|$|E

60|$|This {{was decided}} upon, and the squire's son walked off, {{promising}} to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few hours.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} it then. Ring for our boots {{and tell them}} to order a cab. I'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> when I have changed my dressing-gown and filled my cigar-case." ...|$|E
60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. With the {{greatest}} pleasure. [To MRS. ALLONBY.] I'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> People's mothers always bore me to death. All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy.|$|E
60|$|And {{neither he}} nor the girl changed their {{positions}} relatively for a long time. At length, however, after peering into the woods, and listening, he remarked to the girl that he would <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and then walked off around the spruces.|$|E
60|$|The {{man went}} off noiselessly and swiftly, but <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{few minutes with}} a flat brown basket.|$|R
5000|$|... "Don't {{touch the}} deck, (we'll <b>be)</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sec!" [...] - Ant & Dec (as part of Gameshow Marathon) ...|$|R
60|$|At {{these words}} the whole {{audience}} burst into riotous applause, during which Loring disappeared, but he <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Amen to that, my child," [...] {{concluded}} Madame fervently. [...] "And now, my dear, don't let me {{forget the}} hour of my audience. Hector will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two, and I must not lose any more time gossiping. But before I go, little one, {{will you tell me}} one thing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Travers' hand {{remained}} firmly {{closed on}} the ring. [...] "Yes, that will do," [...] she murmured, hastily. [...] "I'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Get everything ready." [...] With those words she disappeared inside the deckhouse and presently threads of light appeared in the interstices of the boards. Mrs. Travers had lighted a candle in there. She was busy hanging that ring round her neck. She was going. Yes--taking the risk for Tom's sake.|$|E
60|$|Here Mary Erskine {{suddenly}} {{laid her}} head down upon her arms again, on the little work-table before her, and burst into tears. After sobbing convulsively a few minutes she rose, hastily brushed the tears away with her handkerchief, and went toward the door. She then took the water pail, which stood upon a bench near the door, {{and said that she}} was going to get some water, at the spring, for tea, and that she would <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> She returned very soon, with a countenance entirely serene.|$|E

60|$|He {{was quite}} right. He {{went over to}} Liverpool, and <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{fortnight}} with English clothes and a big salary.|$|R
60|$|DAISY. How {{tiresome}} of you. Harry {{ought to}} <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few minutes. He'll be disappointed {{not to have}} seen you.|$|R
6000|$|The {{individual}} {{whose name}} was mention'd, made his excuses to the others, telling them he would <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and left the room. As he {{shut the door behind}} him, and stepp'd into the open air, he saw one of his brothers--his elder by eight or ten years--pacing to and fro with rapid and uneven steps. As the man turn'd in his walk, and the glare of the street lamp fell upon his face, the youth, half-benumb'd as his senses were, was somewhat startled at its paleness and evident perturbation. [...] "Come with me!" [...] said the elder brother, hurriedly, [...] "the illness of our little Jane is worse, and I have been sent for you." ...|$|E
60|$|Lizzie, in her fears, {{had been}} very punctual; and when the two gentlemen reached the door leading up to Mr. Camperdown's chambers, the {{carriage}} was already standing there. Lizzie had come up the stairs, and had been delighted at hearing that Mr. Camperdown was out, and would <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> She instantly resolved {{that it did not}} become her to wait. She had kept her appointment, had not found Mr. Camperdown at home, and would be off as fast as her carriage-wheels could take her. But, unfortunately, while with a gentle murmur she was explaining to the clerk how impossible it was that she should wait for a lawyer who did not keep his own appointment, John Eustace and Mr. Camperdown appeared upon the landing, and she was at once convoyed into the attorney's particular room.|$|E
60|$|A berry-eyed old Indian {{woman with}} the {{complexion}} of dried salmon; her daughter, also with berry eyes, and with a face that seemed wholly made of a moist laugh; 'Yellow Bob,' a Digger 'buck,' so called from the prevailing ochre markings of his cheek, and 'Washooh,' an ex-chief; a nondescript in a blanket, looking like a cheap and dirty doll whose fibrous hair was badly nailed on his carved wooden head, composed the Culpepper household. While the two former were preparing supper in the adjacent dining-room, Yellow Bob, relieved of his burden of game, appeared on the gallery and beckoned mysteriously to his master through the window. James Culpepper went out, returned quickly, and after a minute's hesitation and an uneasy glance towards his sister, who had meantime pushed back her sou'wester from her forehead, and without taking off her jacket had dropped into a chair before the fire with her back towards him, took his gun noiselessly from the rack, and saying carelessly that he would <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> disappeared.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} cut a fishing-pole, and will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> minute." [...] And Ned went {{crashing}} into the thickest part of the wood.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. McWilliams sped to {{the nursery}} {{to see how things}} were going on there. She <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> moment with a new dread. She said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Putnam will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> hour or two." [...] Without another word, Josiah Crabtree {{turned and}} left the room, locking the door behind him.|$|R
60|$|Pedgift Junior smiled compassionately, {{and entered}} on his explanation. It was a lodging-house at Kingsdown Crescent, he begged to state to begin with. He {{had insisted on}} seeing the landlady. A very nice person, with all the remains of having been a fine girl about fifty years ago; quite in Pedgift's style--if he had only been alive at the {{beginning}} of the present century--quite in Pedgift's style. But perhaps Mr. Armadale would prefer hearing about Mrs. Mandeville? Unfortunately, there was nothing to tell. There had been no quarreling, and not a farthing left unpaid: the lodger had gone, and there wasn't an explanatory circumstance to lay hold of anywhere. It was either Mrs. Mandeville's way to vanish, or there was something under the rose, quite undiscoverable so far. Pedgift had got the date on which she left, and the time of day at which she left, and the means by which she left. The means might help to trace her. She had gone away in a cab which the servant had fetched from the nearest stand. The stand was now before their eyes; and the waterman was the first person to apply to--going to the waterman for information being clearly (if Mr. Armadale would excuse the joke) going to the fountain-head. Treating the subject in this airy manner, and telling Allan that he would <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> Pedgift Junior sauntered down the street, and beckoned the waterman confidentially into the nearest public-house.|$|E
6000|$|The dancing began {{within a}} few minutes after they were seated; and James, who had been engaged quite as long as his sister, was very importunate with Isabella to stand up; but John was gone into the card-room to speak to a friend, and nothing, she declared, should induce her to join the set before her dear Catherine could join it too. [...] "I assure you," [...] said she, [...] "I would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world; for if I did we should {{certainly}} be separated the whole evening." [...] Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude, and they continued as they were for three minutes longer, when Isabella, who had been talking to James {{on the other side of}} her, turned again to his sister and whispered, [...] "My dear creature, I am afraid I must leave you, your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin; I know you will not mind my going away, and I dare say John will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and then you may easily find me out." [...] Catherine, though a little disappointed, had too much good nature to make any opposition, and the others rising up, Isabella had only time to press her friend's hand and say, [...] "Good-bye, my dear love," [...] before they hurried off. The younger Miss Thorpes being also dancing, Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs. Thorpe and Mrs. Allen, between whom she now remained. She could not help being vexed at the non-appearance of Mr. Thorpe, for she not only longed to be dancing, but was likewise aware that, as the real dignity of her situation could not be known, she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner. To be disgraced in the eye of the world, to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart is all purity, her actions all innocence, and the misconduct of another the true source of her debasement, is one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine's life, and her fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her character. Catherine had fortitude too; she suffered, but no murmur passed her lips.|$|E
60|$|Away {{rushed the}} Duke of St. James {{as if his}} life were on his speed. He stopped the carriage, spoke, and <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> instant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Needless trouble, my dear Randal. She will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{quarter of}} an hour, and she will pass through this room on her way upstairs." ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{minute with}} a big dipperful of stale brown water which tasted like nectar, and loosed the jaws of Disko and Tom Platt.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> minute," [...] he said, {{as he put}} his {{leg over}} the rail and lightly and swiftly lowered himself down into the darkness.|$|R
