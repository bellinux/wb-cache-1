5|$|Cockroaches can {{be trapped}} in a deep, smooth-walled jar baited with food inside, placed so that {{cockroaches}} can reach the opening, for example with a ramp of card or twigs on the outside. An inch or so of water or stale beer (by itself a cockroach attractant) in the jar {{can be used to}} drown any insects thus captured. The method works well with the American cockroach, <b>but</b> <b>less</b> so with the German cockroach.|$|E

5|$|Education of {{families}} {{is critical in}} developing strategies for understanding strengths and weaknesses; helping the family to cope improves outcomes in children. Prognosis may be improved by diagnosis {{at a younger age}} that allows for early interventions, while interventions in adulthood are valuable <b>but</b> <b>less</b> beneficial. There are legal implications for individuals with AS as they run the risk of exploitation by others and may be unable to comprehend the societal implications of their actions.|$|E
5|$|Episodes of Holby City cost around £370,000 to produce—more {{than the}} BBC soap opera EastEnders, at £130,000 per episode, <b>but</b> <b>less</b> than Casualty at £450,000 per episode, or Dalziel and Pascoe at £700–800,000 per episode. As Holby City is a high-volume, year-round production, it has {{relatively}} low production costs. Set-up costs can be spread {{over many years}} and standing sets can be repeatedly re-used, {{which is not the}} case for shorter series or one-off dramas.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to phosphonium ylides {{used in the}} Wittig reaction, phosphonate-stabilized carbanions are more nucleophilic <b>but</b> <b>less</b> basic. Likewise, phosphonate-stabilized carbanions can be alkylated. Unlike phosphonium ylides, the dialkylphosphate salt byproduct is easily removed by aqueous extraction.|$|E

5|$|KMFDM's sixteenth studio album, Blitz, {{released}} in March 2009, showcased further collaboration with Skold, <b>but</b> <b>less</b> {{input from the}} band members not living in Germany. It reached No.4 on Billboards Dance/Electronic Albums Chart, {{and was on the}} chart for four weeks. Its companion remix album, Krieg, was {{released in}} early 2010. Two compilation albums, Würst and Greatest Shit, were released in September that same year.|$|E
5|$|Keith's {{slow and}} erratic {{movement}} {{caused it to}} produce strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central America. Belize bore {{the brunt of the}} storm, with about $280 million in damage and 19 confirmed fatalities, primarily related to flooding. Several other countries reported significant <b>but</b> <b>less</b> severe flooding, including El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua. Overall, Keith was responsible for 40 deaths, as well as approximately $319 million in damage.|$|E
5|$|Magnus co-ruled with Olaf {{following}} his brother's return to Norway, <b>but</b> <b>less</b> {{than three years}} into his reign, Magnus became ill and died. His kingship has been downplayed in later history {{in part due to}} this. Magnus had only one child, Haakon Toresfostre who was king briefly after Olaf, but who also died young, and without issue.|$|E

5|$|Postovulatory follicles are {{structures}} formed after oocyte release; they do {{not have}} endocrine function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the apoptosis of follicular cells. A degenerative process called follicular atresia reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. This process can also occur, <b>but</b> <b>less</b> frequently, in oocytes in other development stages.|$|E
5|$|Sedna's highly {{elliptical}} orbit means that the probability of its detection was roughly 1 in 80, which suggests that, unless its discovery was a fluke, another 40–120 Sedna-sized objects would exist within the same region. Another object, , has a similar <b>but</b> <b>less</b> extreme orbit: it has a perihelion of 44.3AU, an aphelion of 394 AU, and an orbital period of 3,240 years. It may {{have been affected by}} the same processes as Sedna.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{commonly}} include ecchymosis and swelling. The pain {{is generally}} {{more severe than}} bites from the copperhead, <b>but</b> <b>less</b> so than those from rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.). The formation of vesicles and bullae is less common than with rattlesnake bites, although necrosis can occur. Myokymia is sometimes reported. However, the venom has strong proteolytic activity {{that can lead to}} severe tissue destruction.|$|E

The M values were derived from Spencer's no-stop limits and the repetitive group designators {{were based on a}} 60-minute tissue compartment. This combination resulted in more conservative first dives, <b>but</b> <b>less</b> conservative repetitive dives.|$|E
5|$|The US {{state of}} Oregon uses {{magnesium}} chloride, a relatively cheap chemical similar in snow-melting effects to sodium chloride, <b>but</b> <b>less</b> reactive, while New Zealand uses calcium magnesium acetate, which avoids the environmentally harmful chloride ion altogether. Urea is sometimes used to grit suspension bridges, {{as it does}} not corrode iron or steel at all, but urea is less effective than salt, and can cost up to 7 times more weight-for-weight.|$|E
5|$|The YF-23 was stealthier and faster, <b>but</b> <b>less</b> agile {{than its}} competitor. After a {{four-year}} development and evaluation process, the YF-22 was announced {{the winner in}} 1991 and entered production as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The U.S. Navy considered using the production version of the ATF {{as the basis for}} a replacement to the F-14, but these plans were later canceled. The two YF-23 prototypes were museum exhibits as of 2010.|$|E

50|$|SC-17599 is a steroid {{derivative}} drug {{discovered in}} 1968 which {{acts as a}} selective μ-opioid receptor agonist, {{with little or no}} affinity for the δ-opioid or κ-opioid receptors. It is an active analgesic in vivo, more potent than codeine or pethidine <b>but</b> slightly <b>less</b> potent than morphine, and produces similar effects to morphine in animals <b>but</b> with <b>less</b> sedation.|$|R
5|$|The recent {{discovery}} of a tuatara hatchling on the mainland indicates that attempts to re-establish a breeding population on the New Zealand mainland have had some success. The total population of tuatara {{is estimated to be}} greater than 60,000, <b>but</b> <b>less</b> than 100,000.|$|E
5|$|These {{polycyclic}} hydrocarbons also {{activate the}} AH receptor, <b>but</b> <b>less</b> than TCDD and only temporarily. Even many natural compounds present in vegetables cause some {{activation of the}} AH receptor. This phenomenon {{can be viewed as}} adaptive and beneficial, because it protects the organism from toxic and carcinogenic substances. Excessive and persistent stimulation of AH receptor, however, leads to a multitude of adverse effects.|$|E

Her opposite number creates a broader <b>but</b> <b>less</b> defined reflection of her attention, making a diagonal space between them, in which their charge stands protected.|$|E
