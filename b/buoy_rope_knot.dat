The sound of thunder was produced by the mechanically-timed dropping of metal balls onto a hidden drum.|$|R
50|$|The vibration-proof hitch is a knot {{used for}} {{fastening}} a line or rope to a solid object. This particular hitch {{is designed to}} tighten when subjected to vibration and functions best when the object is fairly large compared to {{the diameter of the}} <b>rope.</b> <b>Knot</b> expert Geoffrey Budworth credits the knot to Amory Bloch Lovins.|$|R

5000|$|For {{all intents}} and purposes, the Lady of the Lake is not malicious. Her {{claiming}} of men is out of love and need, for she does not understand that she is also condemning these individuals to death.

Some men, likely {{in the mood to}} cause a stir, claim that when they swim beyond the boundaries of the designated swim area (marked typically by <b>buoyed</b> <b>rope),</b> they feel [...] "cold fingers" [...] touch and try to grasp at their ankles.|$|R

5000|$|All {{nautical}} instruments that measure {{the speed of}} a ship through water are known as logs. [...] This nomenclature dates {{back to the days of}} sail, when sailors tossed a log attached to a <b>rope</b> <b>knotted</b> at regular intervals off the stern of a ship. Sailors counted the number of knots that passed through their hands in a given time to determine the ship's speed. Today, sailors and aircraft pilots still express speed in knots.|$|R
50|$|Power linemen work on {{electrically}} energized (live) and de-energized (dead) power lines. They may {{perform a}} number of tasks associated with power lines, including installation or replacement of distribution equipment such as capacitor banks, distribution transformers on poles, insulators and fuses. These duties {{include the use of}} <b>ropes,</b> <b>knots,</b> and lifting equipment. These tasks may have to be performed with primitive manual tools where accessibility is limited. Such conditions are common in rural or mountainous areas that are inaccessible to trucks.|$|R
50|$|The shroud knot is a {{multi-strand}} {{bend knot}} used to join two ends of laid (or twisted) <b>rope</b> together. Shroud <b>knots,</b> in general, are {{a class of}} knots {{in which the individual}} strands of laid <b>rope</b> are <b>knotted,</b> but not woven, to the individual strands of another laid rope. This makes them more secure than a simple bend but less secure than a full splice.|$|R
50|$|This {{nomenclature}} {{dates back}} to days of sail when sailors tossed a log attached to <b>rope</b> <b>knotted</b> at regular intervals off the stern of a ship. The sailors would {{count the number of}} knots that passed through their hands in a given period of time. Today sailors still use the unit of knots to express a ship's speed. The speed of the ship was needed to navigate the ship using dead reckoning, which was standard practice in the days before modern navigation instruments like GPS.|$|R
40|$|John Ducey’s fish {{store is}} {{located near the}} {{shoreline}} in Keels, close to where the trap skiffs and other boats are drawn {{up out of the}} water. It was built in the early to mid- 1950 s by Reg Chapman and Isaac Penny, who used the space for net mending. The Ducey family purchased the store in the early 1980 s. The building’s primary function at the moment is as a storage facility [...] housing dip nets, gill nets, balloons, squid jiggers, lump gear, graples, <b>buoy</b> <b>ropes,</b> boat motors, flakes, furniture, and a slide for hauling wood. John also occasionally uses the space as a workshop when he repairs motors...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} <b>rope</b> pumps used <b>knots</b> {{along the}} <b>rope</b> length {{but can be}} made with flexible or rigid valves on the <b>rope</b> instead of <b>knots.</b> Alternatively they may use only rope, simply relying on the water clinging to the rope as it is quickly pulled to the surface.|$|R
5000|$|Vertical caving is a {{specialized}} sport {{that should be}} undertaken only after acquiring knowledge of, and expertise in, proper vertical caving equipment and its use. For obvious reasons, vertical caving is more dangerous than [...] "horizontal caving". Vertical caving requires the intimate understanding of <b>ropes,</b> <b>knots,</b> anchors, rappelling devices and ascending systems. Veteran cavers typically are knowledgeable in self rescue techniques including change-overs (the act of switching from rappel to climb while on rope) and pick-offs (the act of rescuing a stranded caver from his rope and returning him to the ground).|$|R

He noticed for the first time the pretty house-dress she had on, with its barred corsage and under-skirt, and the heavy silken <b>rope</b> <b>knotted</b> round it at the waist, and dropping in heavy tufts or balls in front.|$|R
25|$|Researchers {{classify}} debris {{as either}} land- or ocean-based; in 1991, the United Nations Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution estimated {{that up to}} 80% of the pollution was land-based. More recent {{studies have found that}} more than half of plastic debris found on Korean shores is ocean-based. A wide variety of anthropogenic artifacts can become marine debris; plastic bags, balloons, <b>buoys,</b> <b>rope,</b> medical waste, glass bottles and plastic bottles, cigarette stubs, cigarette lighters, beverage cans, polystyrene, lost fishing line and nets, and various wastes from cruise ships and oil rigs are among the items commonly found to have washed ashore. Six pack rings, in particular, are considered emblematic of the problem.|$|R

5000|$|A Matthew Walker knot is a {{decorative}} knot {{that is used}} to keep the end of a rope from fraying. It is tied by unraveling the strands of a twisted <b>rope,</b> <b>knotting</b> the strands together, then laying up the strands together again. It may also be tied using several separate cords, in which case it keeps the cords together in a bundle. The traditional use of the knot is to form a knob or [...] "stopper" [...] to prevent the end of the rope from passing through a hole, for instance in rigging the lanyards which tension the shrouds on older sailing ships with standing rigging of fiber cordage.|$|R
5000|$|The ends of some {{man-made}} fibers such as Dacron, Nylon, polyethylene, polyester, and polypropylene may be melted to fuse their fibers {{to prevent}} fraying. However, the <b>rope</b> and <b>knotting</b> expert Geoffrey Budworth warns against this practice thus: ...|$|R
50|$|It was {{to recover}} the lost cable of these expeditions that the Elba was got ready for sea. Jenkin had fitted her out the year before for laying the Cagliari to Malta and Corfu cables but on this {{occasion}} she was better equipped. She had a new machine for picking up the cable, and a sheave or pulley at the bows for it to run over, both designed by Jenkin, together {{with a variety of}} wooden <b>buoys,</b> <b>ropes,</b> and chains. Liddell, assisted by F. C. Webb and Fleeming Jenkin, {{was in charge of the}} expedition. Jenkin had nothing to do with the electrical work, his care being the deck machinery for raising the cable but it was a responsible job. He reported the expedition in letters to Miss Austin and in diary entries.|$|R

50|$|On <b>knotted</b> <b>rope</b> halters, the <b>knot</b> {{often is}} used under the jaw {{both as a}} {{decorative}} knot, and also to fashion the lower loop onto which a lead rope is attached.

50|$|The {{fish flake}} was a {{permanent}} structure {{that was part}} of the landscape of a fishing village. These were not located too far away from the fishing stages that were built on the shoreline. The flake was built high off the ground and required stable construction with a sloping ramp to gain access to it. The ramp was required such that fishermen carried a full load of fish on barrows was able to negotiate its accent. At one end of the flake was built a building that served dual purposes. The construction of the building, called fish store, was of two story construction and had to be large enough to accommodate a season's voyage of fish on the top level. In the lower section of the fish store was kept the gear that was used for fishing, <b>buoy's,</b> <b>ropes,</b> killicks, grapples and other miscellany items.|$|R
