5|$|The cockroach's {{ability to}} {{withstand}} radiation better than human <b>beings</b> <b>can</b> be explained through the cell cycle. Cells {{are most vulnerable}} {{to the effects of}} radiation when they are dividing. A cockroach's cells divide only once each time it molts, which is weekly at most in a juvenile roach. Since not all cockroaches would be molting at the same time, many would be unaffected by an acute burst of radiation, but lingering radioactive fallout would still be harmful.|$|E

5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} <b>beings</b> <b>can</b> never be treated merely as means to ends; they must always also {{be treated as}} ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E
25|$|Heaven, or the heavens, is {{a common}} religious, cosmological, or transcendent place where beings such as gods, angels, jinn, saints, or venerated {{ancestors}} are said to originate, be enthroned, or live.

5000|$|In Hindu philosophy, Jagra {{is one of}} {{the four}} states of {{consciousness}} a man (or a <b>being)</b> <b>can</b> have. It can be roughly translated as [...] "wakefulness". It is that part of consciousness when a person or <b>being</b> <b>can</b> sense this physical universe. Other states of consciousness are swapna, susupti and turiya. Later commentators increased the states of consciousness from four to seven.|$|R

25|$|For deists, human <b>beings</b> <b>can</b> know God only via {{reason and}} the {{observation}} of nature, but not by revelation or supernatural manifestations (such as miracles) – phenomena Deists regard with caution if not skepticism. Deism is related to naturalism because it credits the formation {{of life and the}} universe to a higher power, using only natural processes. Deism may also include a spiritual element, involving experiences of God and nature.|$|E
25|$|Referring to potentiality, {{this is what}} a {{thing is}} capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the {{conditions}} are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (dynamei) plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially <b>beings</b> <b>can</b> either 'act' (poiein) or 'be acted upon' (paschein), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate– being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise– acting).|$|E
25|$|The omnipotent being cannot {{create such}} a stone because its power {{is equal to}} itself—thus, {{removing}} the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2—as long as we also know the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, {{it is possible for}} non-omnipotent beings to compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent <b>beings</b> <b>can</b> do something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position Augustine of Hippo took in his The City of God:For He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some things for the very reason that He is omnipotent.|$|E

[...] Apprentices were mostly found in the larger mills, which had somewhat better conditions; some even worked a 12-hour day or less (the Grant brothers' mill at Tottington worked an 11.5 hour day: [...] "This establishment has perfect ventilation; all the apprentices, and in fact all the children, are healthy, happy, clean, and well clothed proper and daily attention is paid to their instruction and they regularly attend divine worship on Sundays."): in other mills children worked up to 15 hours a day in bad conditions (e.g. Gortons and Roberts' Elton mill: [...] "Most filthy; no ventilation; the apprentices and other children ragged, puny, not half clothed, and seemingly not half fed; no instruction of any sort; no human <b>beings</b> <b>can</b> be more wretched").|$|E
