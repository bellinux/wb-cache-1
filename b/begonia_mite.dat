The history of these plants provides insight into ornamental plant development. Future development efforts may benefit from understanding the procedures that made New Guinea Impatiens a success. New Guinea Impatiens were first introduced in Europe in 1886 and instantly became popular. By the early 1900 s they had virtually disappeared from cultivation because of <b>Begonia</b> <b>mite</b> infestations (Hooker 1909).

In 1970 a plant exploration trip co-sponsored by Longwood Gardens and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) rediscovered New Guinea Impatiens. Their cooperative venture became {{a turning point in}} the plants' development. The two organizations were interested in the possible display uses of the plant and in discovering and distributing information about its breeding and culture. Universities and commercial growers were able to work with the plants because of the commitment of Longwood and USDA to share information. Plant collectors, researchers, and breeders were involved in the advancement of New Guinea Impatiens in varying degrees. Only a handful of individuals were dedicated enough to promote and develop the plants.
