5|$|A {{tree nursery}} was {{established}} at Kinloch in 1960 {{in order to}} support a substantial programme of re-introducing twenty native species including silver birch, hawthorn, rowan and holly. The forested area, which consists of over a million re-introduced native trees and shrubs, is essentially confined to the vicinity of Kinloch and the slopes near this site surrounding Loch Scresort and on nearby Meall á Ghoirtein. The island's flora came to widespread attention with the 1999 publication of the book A Rum Affair by Karl Sabbagh, a British writer and television producer. The book told of a long-running scientific controversy over the alleged discovery of certain plants on Rùm by botanist John William Heslop-Harrison—discoveries that are now considered to be fraudulent. Heslop Harrison is widely believed to have placed many of these plants on the island himself to provide evidence for his theory about the geological development of the Hebridean islands. Nonetheless, the native flora offers much of interest. There are rare arctic sandwort and alpine pennycress, endemic varieties of the heath spotted-orchid and eyebright, as well as more common species such as sundew, <b>butterwort,</b> blue heath milkwort and roseroot. A total of 590 higher plant and fern taxa have been recorded.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{mention of}} <b>butterworts</b> in botanical {{literature}} is an entry entitled [...] ("lard herb") by Vitus Auslasser in his 1479 work on medicinal herbs entitled Macer de Herbarium. The name [...] is still used for <b>butterworts</b> in Tirol, Austria.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Butterworts</b> are {{distributed}} throughout the northern hemisphere (...) [...] The greatest concentration of species, however, is in humid mountainous regions of Central America (including Mexico) and South America, where populations can be found {{as far south as}} Tierra del Fuego. Australia is the only continent without any native <b>butterworts.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1583, Clusius {{distinguished}} between two <b>butterwort</b> forms in his Historia stirpium rariorum per Pannoniam, Austriam: a blue-flowered form (P. vulgaris) and a white-flowered form (P. alpina), which Linnaeus included in his Species Plantarum in 1753 along with P. villosa and P. lusitanica.|$|E
25|$|The greater <b>butterwort</b> (Pinguicula grandiflora) (also {{known as}} the Kerry violet) is a {{carnivorous}} plant found in bogs. It digests insects to supplement the poor supply of nutrients (especially nitrogen) available from the bog. Its spectacular purple flowers bloom in late May and early June.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaf blade}} of a <b>butterwort</b> is smooth, rigid, and succulent, usually bright green or pinkish in colour. Depending on species, {{the leaves are}} between 2 and 30cm.(1-12") long. The leaf shape depends on the species, but is usually roughly obovate, spatulate, or linear.|$|E

25|$|<b>Butterworts</b> {{are widely}} {{cultivated}} by carnivorous plant enthusiasts. The temperate species {{and many of}} the Mexican <b>butterworts</b> are relatively easy to grow and have therefore gained relative popularity. Two of the most widely grown plants are the hybrid cultivars Pinguicula × 'Sethos' and Pinguicula × 'Weser'. Both are crosses of Pinguicula ehlersiae and Pinguicula moranensis, and are employed by commercial orchid nurseries to combat pests.|$|R

25|$|European folk {{medicine}} didn't distinguish between various <b>butterwort</b> species, but prescribed them for sores, swelling, sciatica, and liver disease, {{as well as}} stomach aches, chest pain and respiratory problems. Its supposed effectiveness against these ailments is attributed to the cinnamic acid found in the plants.|$|E
25|$|This species grows {{from sea}} level in {{northwest}} Siberia to altitudes {{of up to}} 4,100m (13,500ft), in open, sunny locations. The plant prefers wet soils such as seeps with alkali to neutral pH. P. alpina is, however, unusually tolerant of soil dryness for a temperate <b>butterwort.</b> It is typically found in subalpine seeps or bogs or alpine rock-meadows.|$|E
25|$|The great {{majority}} of individual Pinguicula species have a very limited distribution. The two <b>butterwort</b> species with the widest distribution - P. alpina and P. vulgaris - are found throughout much of Europe and North America. Other species found in the United States include P. caerulea, P.ionantha, P. lutea, P. macroceras, P. planifolia, P. primuliflora, P. pumila, and P. villosa.|$|E
50|$|ARWEA {{is widely}} {{recognized}} for its wildflower diversity. Carnivorous pitcher plants and <b>butterworts,</b> {{along with several}} orchid species, may be seen throughout the year.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Butterworts</b> need {{habitats}} {{that are}} almost constantly moist or wet, at least during their carnivorous growth stage. Many Mexican species lose their carnivorous leaves, and sprout succulent leaves, or die back to onion-like [...] "bulbs" [...] to survive the winter drought, at which point they can survive in bone-dry conditions. The moisture they need for growing can be supplied by either a high groundwater table, or by high humidity or high precipitation. Unlike many other carnivorous plants that require sunny locations, many <b>butterworts</b> thrive in part-sun or even shady conditions.|$|R
25|$|Utricularia is {{the largest}} genus of {{carnivorous}} plants. It {{is one of the}} three genera that make up the Bladderwort family (Lentibulariaceae), along with the <b>butterworts</b> (Pinguicula) and corkscrew plants (Genlisea).|$|R
25|$|Significant {{amounts of}} plant species {{found in the}} park have unusual {{geographic}} distributions and are of localised occurrence within Ireland. These plant species are grouped within four main categories: arctic-alpine plants, Atlantic species, North American species and very rare species. Atlantic species are species which are otherwise found mostly in southern and south-western Europe, for example arbutus, St Patrick's cabbage and greater <b>butterwort.</b> North American species include blue-eyed grass and pipewort.|$|E
25|$|The Lake District {{is home to}} a {{great variety}} of wildlife, due to its range of varied topography, lakes and forests. It {{provides}} a home for the red squirrel and colonies of sundew and <b>butterwort,</b> two of the few carnivorous plants native to Britain. The Lake District is a major sanctuary for the red squirrel and has the largest population in England (out of the estimated 140,000 red squirrels in the United Kingdom, compared with about 2.5million grey squirrels).|$|E
25|$|The {{bush and}} shrublands, which {{characterize}} {{the remainder of}} the spaces (74% of the park), are dominated by dwarf (Ulex minor) and European (Ulex europaeus) gorse and heather (Erica umbellata and Calluna vulgaris), with a mixtures of common juniper (Juniperus communis), southern heather (Erica australis) in the upper altitudes, while lower altitude bush includes cross-leaved heather (Erica tetralix), dwarf gorse (Ulex minor), Dorset heath (Erica ciliaris), common sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), pale <b>butterwort</b> (Pinguicula lusitanica), marsh violet (Viola palustris) and purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea).|$|E
50|$|In addition, the Preserve {{contains}} typical bog plants, such as sundews (Drosera), <b>butterworts</b> (Pinguicula), bladderworts (Utricularia) and {{pitcher plants}} (Sarracenia). The area {{is also home}} to rare gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus).|$|R
50|$|Pocosin wetlands, {{a type of}} wetland that {{supports}} rare carnivorous plant species, {{are found in the}} park. Carnivorous plants found at this park include Venus flytraps, pitcher plants, <b>butterworts</b> and bladderworts.|$|R

25|$|As {{with almost}} all {{carnivorous}} plants, the flowers of butterworts are held {{far above the}} rest of the plant by a long stalk, {{in order to reduce the}} probability of trapping potential pollinators. The single, long-lasting flowers are zygomorphic, with two lower lip petals characteristic of the bladderwort family, and a spur extending from the back of the flower. The calyx has five sepals, and the petals are arranged in a two-part lower lip and a three-part upper lip. Most <b>butterwort</b> flowers are blue, violet or white, often suffused with a yellow, greenish or reddish tint. P. laueana and the newly described P. caryophyllacea are unique in having a strikingly red flowers. Butterworts are often cultivated and hybridized primarily for their flowers.|$|E
500|$|Pinguicula moranensis [...] is a {{perennial}} rosette-forming insectivorous herb native to Mexico and Guatemala. [...] A species of <b>butterwort,</b> it forms summer rosettes of flat, succulent leaves up to 10centimeters (4in) long, which {{are covered in}} mucilaginous (sticky) glands that attract, trap, and digest arthropod prey. Nutrients derived from the prey are used to supplement the nutrient-poor substrate that the plant grows in. [...] In the winter the plant forms a non-carnivorous rosette of small, fleshy leaves that conserves energy while food and moisture supplies are low. [...] Single pink, purple, or violet flowers appear twice a year on upright stalks up to 25 centimeters long.|$|E
25|$|The {{round to}} egg-shaped seed {{capsules}} open when dry into two halves, exposing numerous small (0.5–1mm), brown seeds. If moisture is present the silique closes, protecting the seed and opening again upon dryness {{to allow for}} wind dispersal. Many species have a net-like pattern on their seed surface {{to allow them to}} land on water surfaces without sinking, since many non-epiphytic <b>butterworts</b> grow near water sources. The haploid chromosome number of <b>butterworts</b> is either n = 8 or n = 11 (or a multiple thereof), depending on species. The exception is P. lusitanica, whose chromosome count is n = 6.|$|R
50|$|<b>Butterworts</b> can {{be divided}} roughly into two main groups based on the climate in which they grow; each group is the further {{subdivided}} based on morphological characteristics. Although these groups are not cladistically supported by genetic studies, these groupings are nonetheless convenient for horticultural purposes.Tropical <b>butterworts</b> either form somewhat compact winter rosettes composed of fleshy leaves or retain carnivorous leaves year-round. Temperate species often form tight buds (called hibernacula) composed of scale-like leaves during a winter dormancy period. During this time the roots (with the exception of P. alpina) and carnivorous leaves wither. Temperate species flower when they form their summer rosettes while tropical species flower at each rosette change.|$|R
50|$|The Shehy Mountains {{are mostly}} covered with peat bogs and coarse grassland, {{but there are}} also some small conifer {{plantations}} scattered around the area. Plants typically found here include <b>butterworts,</b> sundews, heather, and bilberry, among many others.|$|R
500|$|On Los Angeles's skid row, penny-pinching Gravis Mushnick owns a florist shop {{which is}} staffed {{by him and}} his two employees, the sweet but simple Audrey Fulquard and clumsy Seymour Krelboyne. Although the rundown shop gets little business, there are some repeat customers; for instance, Mrs. Siddie Shiva shops almost daily for flower {{arrangements}} for her many relatives' funerals. Another regular customer is Burson Fouch, who eats the plants he buys for lunch. When Seymour fouls up the arrangement of Dr. Farb, a sadistic dentist, Mushnick fires him. Hoping Mushnick will change his mind, Seymour tells him about a special plant that he crossbred from a <b>butterwort</b> and a Venus flytrap. Bashfully, Seymour admits that he named the plant [...] "Audrey Jr.", a revelation that delights the real Audrey.|$|E

2500|$|Butterworts {{also produce}} a strong {{bactericide}} which prevents insects from rotting {{while they are}} being digested. According to Linnaeus, this property {{has long been known}} by northern Europeans, who applied <b>butterwort</b> leaves to the sores of cattle to promote healing. Additionally, <b>butterwort</b> leaves were used to curdle milk and form a buttermilk-like fermented milk product called [...] (Sweden) and [...] (Norway).|$|E
60|$|The <b>Butterworts</b> are a {{perfectly}} distinct group--whether small or large, always recognizable at a glance. Their proper Latin name will be Pinguicula, (plural Pinguiculæ,)--their English, Bog-Violet, or, more familiarly, Butterwort; and their French, as at present, Grassette.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{terrestrial}} plants also form hibernacula. These include some temperate sundews (Drosera) such as D. anglica, D. filiformis, D. intermedia, D. rotundifolia; and some temperate <b>butterworts</b> (Pinguicula) such as P. balcanica, P. grandiflora, P. longifolia, and P. vulgaris.|$|R
50|$|Nine {{species of}} {{carnivorous}} plants including pitcher plants, <b>butterworts</b> and sundews {{are present in}} the reserve. These plants have modifications which enable them to catch insects to provide the nitrogen they need and which is deficient in their swampy habitat.|$|R
