25|$|The uniform {{crossover}} evaluates each <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parent strings for {{exchange with}} a probability of 0.5.

Unfortunately, no satisfactory theory exists to explain the discrepancies between the uniform crossover and the traditional approaches.|$|E

Some scholars suggest that Japan's road to World War II had begun not upon winning the Russo–Japanese War, but when it lost the peace.|$|E
25|$|MIPS III {{removed the}} Coprocessor 3 (CP3) support instructions, and reused its opcodes {{for the new}} doubleword instructions. The {{remaining}} coprocessors gained instructions to move doublewords between coprocessor registers and the GPRs. The floating general registers (FGRs) were extended to 64 bits and the requirement for instructions to use even-numbered register only was removed. This is incompatible with earlier versions of the architecture; a <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> floating-point control/status register is used to operate the MIPS III floating-point unit (FPU) in a MIPS I- and II-compatible mode. The floating-point control registers were not extended for compatibility. The only new floating-point instructions added were those to copy doublewords between the CPU and FPU convert single- and double-precision floating-point numbers into doubleword integers and vice versa.|$|E

Mark Aguirre and James Donaldson both played in the 1988 NBA All-Star Game, the Mavericks rattled off a franchise-best 11-game winning streak, and Rolando Blackman scored his 10,000th career point. Aguirre led the team in scoring for the sixth consecutive year with 25.1 points per game, and Roy Tarpley won the NBA Sixth Man Award with averages of 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. The season saw the Mavs' deepest playoff run to date. They dispatched the Houston Rockets in four games and the Nuggets in six, leaving only the defending NBA Champion Lakers between them and their first-ever trip to the NBA Finals. The Mavericks gave the Lakers everything they could handle, {{but in the end}} the more experienced Lakers prevailed, defeating Dallas in seven games on the way to eventually winning their second consecutive NBA Championship.|$|E

Many hardware platforms include support for finding the number of leading zeros, or equivalent operations, which can be used to quickly find the binary logarithm.

500|$|It is to {{be noted}} that the riders started in reverse order of the general classification, so Pinot was the last one to start.

500|$|Astana {{turned in}} their strongest team time trial {{performance}} in the Vuelta, finishing fourth of the 22 teams. Kiserlovski commented after the ride that the team was well pleased with fourth place and the small time gap to the stage winners [...] Gasparotto had high placings in stages 2 and 3, but did not come especially close to winning either, taking seventh in a field sprint and then ninth over a minute down on the back-to-back days. In the Vuelta's first summit finish {{the next day in}} the Sierra Nevada, Kessiakoff finished in the 29-rider leading peloton 11 seconds back of the stage winner, which moved him up to seventh overall. Kashechkin, on the other hand, finished in the second-to-last large group, losing 18 minutes and any chance at serious overall contention. Kessiakoff moved up to sixth the next day by finishing tenth on the Valdepeñas de Jaén climb. After two more tenth places on difficult stages, Kessiakoff's position improved to fourth overall, gaining that position on stage 9. He occupied fifth after stage 11, having slipped a <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stage 10 individual time trial, still leaving him to be described as the [...] "big surprise of the Vuelta a España." [...] After 11 stages, Kashechkin lay 107th, nearly {{an hour and a half}} behind the race leader. Team manager Martinelli stated that no pressure for a particular final placing would be put on Kessiakoff. Sporting director Aydar Mahmet expressed the team's dissatisfaction with Kashechkin publicly suggesting the expectation of a high placing when he obviously did not have the form to attain it.|$|E
500|$|On 1 December, Benfica played Porto in the Clássico. Ricardo Quaresma took {{advantage}} of a 42nd-minute counterattack to dribble past David Luiz and score the winning goal for Porto. It was Benfica's first league loss at Luz since 28 January 2006. Camacho said, [...] "We were inexperienced, failed to retain the ball and allowed counter-attacks." [...] Three days later, Benfica travelled to Donetsk to play Shakhtar in the final match of the Champions League group stage, and Cardozo scored twice in the first 25 minutes to give Benfica the win. The club overtook Shakhtar, finishing third and qualifying for the UEFA Cup, and Camacho {{was pleased with the}} result. On 9 December, Benfica began their Portuguese Cup run by hosting Académica. The club won with goals by Luisão and Cardozo; Académica scored a consolation goal after a mistake by Benfica's goalkeeper, Butt. According to Camacho, [...] "We suffered a <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half. Académica's goal complicated things." [...] League play resumed on 15 December, with Benfica commuting to the Estádio do Restelo to face Belenenses. The club failed to stem their hosts' momentum, giving up a 71st-minute goal for their second-straight league loss. Camacho accepted the blame: [...] "When you lose it is always the manager's fault. I failed to pass the message to my players." [...] Benfica ended 2007 by hosting Estrela da Amadora on 20 December, winning 3–0 with all goals scored in the second half. The win placed Benfica seven points behind league leaders Porto, who had their first league loss to Nacional.
