Sweden was noted for having proved to overcome the crisis <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> developed countries, and this was highlighted by the Government as a force in the run-up to 2010 general election. As Sweden emerged as the best country on several areas after the financial crisis it brought a resurgence of support, which eventually resulted in his re-election in 2010. This was the first time ever that the Moderate Party was re-eleted after completing a full first term.|$|E

His 19 Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) were six <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> Major League second baseman that season, {{according}} to Fangraphs.

His 2.6 defensive Wins Above Replacement, according to the Baseball Reference formula, ranked him 8th among all Major League players regardless of position. Kinsler had put up 50 Defensive Runs Saved over the last three seasons, according to The Fielding Bible. The next-best total among Major League second basemen was 29, from Colorado's DJ LeMahieu.|$|E

Defending champion Sánchez won the first stage, atop , by outkicking Joaquim Rodríguez in sight of the line as the two finished four seconds <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> riders. However, he lost the race lead to Rodríguez when the latter won stage 2 {{in the city of}} Burgos. The stage 3 team time trial then dropped Sánchez to fifth overall, before he improved to fourth after stage 4. Landa won stage 5 from a breakaway, his first professional victory. Winning the final climb also gave him enough points to take the race's mountains classification. The squad placed three riders in the top ten, with Sánchez fourth, Antón eighth, and Nieve tenth. Antón rounded out the team's season by winning the climber's prize at the inaugural Tour of Beijing.|$|E

25|$|Clarke {{knew the}} {{geography}} of the region <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> person of his time, as his office was responsible for every land survey made in East Florida between 1811 and 1821.

In his will he distributed more than 33,000 acres to his heirs, {{as well as several}} houses and scattered lots. He spoke Spanish fluently, but his writing in the language was ungrammatical. His initials have been given incorrectly by many historians as I. F., confusion arising because the capital Is and Js of his handwriting were indistinguishable.

25|$|His {{choice for}} the 1911/1912 Ashes tour was {{surprising}} but Smith's skill at taking Foster was sufficient to keep Herbert Strudwick out of the Test line-up.

Warwickshire unsurprisingly declined to mid-table, but Smith maintained his form so well in 1913 with a personal high 68 dismissals that he was chosen for the South African tour. However, he lost his place to Strudwick after one Test and never regained his England place as Strudwick and Arthur Dolphin overtook him.|$|E

25|$|There {{were some}} jurists who thought rulings derived through analogy could {{contradict}} a ruling {{derived from the}} Qur'an and the authentic hadith. However, Ibn Taymiyyah disagreed because he thought a contradiction between the definitive canonical texts of Islam, and definitive reason was impossible {{and that this was}} also the understanding of the salaf. Racha el-Omari says that on an epistemological level, Ibn Taymiyyah considered the Salaf to be <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> later scholars in understanding the agreement between revelation and reason. One example for this is the use of analogy in the Islamic legal principle of maslaha (public good) about which Ibn Taymiyya believed, if there were to be any contradiction to revelation then it is due to a misunderstanding or misapplication of the concept of utility. He said that to assess the utility of something, the criteria for benefit and harm should come from the Qur'an and sunnah, a criteria which he also applied to the establishment of a correct analogy.|$|E
25|$|The post of CIGS {{was less}} {{rewarding}} than command {{in an important}} theatre of war but the CIGS chose the generals who commanded those theatres and decided what men and munitions they should have. When it came to finding the right commanders he often complained that many officers {{who would have been}} good commanders had been killed in the First World War and that this was one reason behind the difficulties the British had {{in the beginning of the}} war. When General Sir Claude Auchinleck was to be replaced as the commander of the British Eighth Army in 1942, Brooke preferred Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery instead of Lieutenant General William Gott, who was Churchill's candidate. Soon thereafter Gott was killed in an air crash and Montgomery received the command. Brooke would later reflect upon the tragic event which led to the appointment of Montgomery as an intervention by God. Earlier in 1942 Brooke had been offered the command of British forces in the Middle East. Brooke declined, believing he now knew <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> general how to deal with Churchill.|$|E
25|$|The British tank force {{consisted}} of the slow and heavily armed infantry tank, together with the faster and lighter cruiser tank. The cruiser tanks were intended to operate independently of the slow-moving infantry and their heavier infantry tanks. The British doctrine at the time did not foresee the armoured division having a role {{in its own right}} and was assigned the traditional cavalry role. They would then deploy independent tank brigades equipped with the infantry tanks to operate with the infantry. German panzer and light divisions were equipped with the latest Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks, which could outgun all British tanks. By 1942, American Grant and Lend-Lease Sherman tanks entered British service. These tanks, with a 75mm gun, and the ability to fire high explosive and anti-tank rounds, were <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> tank then in British service. A British development of the Sherman led to the Sherman Firefly, which was the only tank able to defeat German Panther, Tiger I and Tiger II tanks at range, until the Comet tank entered service in late 1944.|$|E
