25|$|For 1994, Rodger Dowson Engineering and Team Dynamics ran {{the works}} Mazdas, with David Leslie and Matt Neal being entered in a two-car team, but the season {{would prove to}} be less successful. Neal was forced to {{withdraw}} from the series after suffering injuries from a <b>big</b> <b>crash</b> in the sixth round at Silverstone, whilst Leslie withdrew halfway through the season due to budgetary problems. Leslie's best finishes were a pair of eighth positions at the first two rounds, whilst Neal's was a tenth at Snetterton. Neal finished 23rd in the championship, level with privateers James Thompson and Nigel Smith, whilst Leslie finished 20th. Mazda were classified tenth, and last, in the manufacturer's championship. The Xedos 6's running gear was later used in a 323F built for the 1994 FIA Touring Car World Cup and driven by Neal.|$|E
25|$|Hushovd {{finished}} {{safely in}} the front group {{on the road in}} stage 4, a stage with a similar profile to the first in that was largely flat with an uphill finish, on the Mûr-de-Bretagne. This ride retained his race lead. Farrar missed out on the sprint finish to stage 5, being caught up by one of the day's many crashes. Hushovd was able to stay {{at the front of the}} race and take tenth in the sprint. Stage 6 had a rolling profile, suitable for classics riders like Hushovd. In a slightly reduced field sprint, that notably lacked Farrar and Cavendish, Hushovd took third behind countryman Edvald Boasson Hagen. Farrar again missed out on the finale to the flat seventh stage, being brought down in a <b>big</b> <b>crash</b> with other riders like Alexander Vinokourov, Levi Leipheimer, and Chris Horner. Hushovd took seventh in the sprint to safely retain the race lead for another day.|$|E

Ladagnous took the maximum points on offer, as the four leaders rolled through the line without competition.

500|$|The {{teams of}} several of the general {{classification}} contenders were prevalent {{on the front of the}} peloton as they set about reducing the advantage that the breakaway group of six riders were holding over them. The gap had been reduced to around the three-minute mark with [...] left of the stage to cover. Another <b>big</b> <b>crash</b> happened some [...] later with 's Simon Gerrans, [...] rider Pim Ligthart and Dan Martin of [...] among those to hit the tarmac. [...] moved forward, and pulled the gap under two minutes and caused the breakaway to splinter through pressure. Bernaudeau– who had figured at each of the mountain passes to the point– and Doi failed to stay with their companions as they approached the day's final climb, the Côte de la Sizeranne. Tjallingii was also dropped by the remaining members of the breakaway, while in the main field, Alexander Vinokourov (...) and Andy Schleck of – who had been criticised by team manager Johan Bruyneel for his poor opening half to the season– were both struggling off the back of the group. Both riders lost over three minutes by the stage end.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the next}} {{race of the}} season in Barcelona, Räikkönen was unhappy with the setup of the car and was able to qualify only in 7th place. However, he had a good opening lap in the race and made up 2 places to finish the race in 5th position. Räikkönen termed Monaco GP {{qualifying}} session to be a [...] "disaster"; he was only able to qualify in 6th position, with his teammate Sebastian Vettel qualifying in 3rd, followed by Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat in the Red Bulls. In the race, Räikkönen was able to move up to 5th place, before being controversially overtaken by Ricciardo, and thus held his qualifying position to finish the race in 6th, while Lewis Hamilton was robbed of his race win by a botched up pit stop strategy. Räikkönen put up a strong qualifying performance at Montreal to take 3rd on the grid behind the two Mercedes drivers. During the race, while on the out-lap from a pitstop, Räikkönen suffered a repeat of the incident at the previous year's race and spun at the hairpin, which was attributed to an engine torque mapping issue. This caused him to lose his 3rd place to Valtteri Bottas. In the Austrian Grand Prix he was involved in a <b>big</b> <b>crash</b> with Fernando Alonso which left Alonso's McLaren on top of Räikkönen's Ferrari. However both left unscathed. After a disappointing showing caused by changing weather in Great Britain, Räikkönen bounced back strongly running second behind Vettel looking set for a 1–2 in Hungary, when a technical failure regarding the energy recovery system meant he lost straightline speed. An untimely safety car meant losing further positions after the restart and after a pitstop to re-fire the engine meant he dropped out of the points he retired when the problem did not fix itself as he had lost the chance to get back past any cars.|$|E

6000|$|One night, the <b>big</b> <b>crash</b> came. He {{was troubled}} {{in his own}} mind over his {{attempts}} to make himself [...] "worthy of the friendship" [...] of Mrs. Reiver. The past ten days had been very bad ones, and the end of it all was that he received the arrears of two and three-quarter years of sipping in one attack of delirium tremens of the subdued kind; beginning with suicidal depression, going on to fits and starts and hysteria, and ending with downright raving. As he sat in a chair in front of the fire, or walked up and down the room picking a handkerchief to pieces, you heard what poor Moriarty really thought of Mrs. Reiver, for he raved about her and his own fall for the most part; though he ravelled some P. W. D. accounts into the same skein of thought. He talked, and talked, and talked in a low dry whisper to himself, and there was no stopping him. He seemed to know that there was something wrong, and twice tried to pull himself together and confer rationally with the Doctor; but his mind ran out of control at once, and he fell back to a whisper and the story of his troubles. It is terrible to hear a big man babbling like a child of all that a man usually locks up, and puts away in the deep of his heart. Moriarty read out his very soul for the benefit of any one who was in the room between ten- thirty that night and two-forty-five next morning.|$|E
