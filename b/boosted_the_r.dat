50|$|The {{capital cost}} for {{this version of}} the plan is {{estimated}} at $2.2 billion, with a projected daily ridership of 170,000. 53% of the route is either in a bus-only lane, dedicated busway, or tunnel. This was increased from the previous plan for Phase 2, to improve travel times. As a result of the implementation of Phase 2, ridership growth on <b>the</b> <b>Red,</b> Orange, Blue, and Green lines would be slowed, but Commuter Rail ridership <b>boosted.</b> <b>The</b> Urban <b>Ring</b> would have a higher collective ridership than the Orange Line, Blue Line, or the entire Commuter Rail system.|$|R
50|$|The Orioles sent Alfredo Simón, who had {{a history}} of success vs. Boston against Jon Lester, who was 14-0 {{lifetime}} with a 3.26 ERA against the Baltimore Orioles. The scoring got started with Dustin Pedroia getting a single to score Mike Avilés to give <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Sox a 1-0 lead. However, the Orioles struck back {{in the bottom of the}} 3rd as J. J. Hardy, laced his 30th home run of the season into left field to give the O's a 2-1 advantage. In the top of the 4th with Marco Scutaro at 3rd base, a controversial balk call was made on Alfredo Simón which tied up the game at two apiece. The bottom of the 4th went by one-two-three for the O's. In the top of the 5th, Dustin Pedroia hit a one-out solo home run to give <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Sox back <b>the</b> lead, 3-2. At the start of the bottom of the 7th, the game was delayed for 85 minutes because of some heavy thunderstorms that moved through the area. In the top of the 8th, Marco Scutaro had singled to right and was on as a hopeful insurance run to <b>boost</b> <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> Sox lead. Carl Crawford then picked up a double after Nolan Reimold mistimed his jump to make the catch and Adam Jones fired the ball to catcher Matt Wieters to get Scutaro out. Mike Avilés fouled out and the inning ended.|$|R
40|$|The Ca 2 + inflow through basolateral {{voltage-gated}} Ca 2 + {{channels of}} cochlear and vestibular hair cells sustains transmitter release at the cytoneural junction. It is therefore important to establish how these channels are regulated by voltage and/or by intracellular factors. It {{has been found}} that in many preparations the Ca 2 + channels are regulated via a G protein or via a phosphorylation. Moreover, {{it has been suggested that}} prolonged depolarizations (> 1 sec) produce a long term inactivation of Ca 2 + current in turtle vestibular hair cells, as found in other preparations. In the present work, the regulation of Ca 2 + channels of semicircular canal vestibular hair cells was investigated. The experiments were performed on hair cells mechanically or enzymatically dissociated, recorded in the whole-cell configuration under visual control, using intra- and extracellular solutions designed to block all but the voltage-activated Ca 2 + currents. In the presence of 1 mM ATP in the pipette solution, about 60 % of the recorded cells displayed a Ca 2 + current formed by an L-type and a drug-resistant (R 2) components, while the remaining 40 % also exhibited an additional drug-resistant fraction (R 1), which inactivated in a Ca-dependent manner. If ATP was raised to 10 mM, <b>the</b> <b>R</b> 1 component was progressively enhanced as intracellular ATP equilibrated with the pipette solution, and became apparent in all recordings. Nifedipine (5 mM) reduced the plateau amplitude by the same amount (70 %), irrespective of the size attained following the run-up. This indicates that the run-up was targeted to <b>the</b> <b>R</b> 1 and L current fractions, without affecting <b>the</b> <b>R</b> 2 channel. In cells having <b>the</b> <b>R</b> 1 component, high ATP increased <b>the</b> <b>R</b> 1 and <b>the</b> L component of about 380 % and about 170 %, respectively. Cells initially lacking <b>the</b> <b>R</b> 1 component had a similar increase in the L component, while <b>the</b> <b>R</b> 1 component raised from 0 to about 25 pA. The addition of cGMP or cAMP (1 mM) to the internai solution, containing 1 or 10 mM ATP, did not cause any further increase of the current. It is concluded that intracellular ATP <b>boosts</b> <b>the</b> <b>R</b> 1 - and L-type current directly or via a cyclic-nucleotide independent phosphorylation. Despite the presence of intracellular ATP, long depolarizations (> 5 s) produced a progressive decay of current to a steady state level: larger the depolarization, faster the decay. The steady level was usually outward for positive potentials (+ 20 mV); the decay was fully reversible upon returning to the holding potential. A steady inward current was recorded if the internai Cs+ was substituted with NMG+, demonstrating that the decay was actually generated by an outward current carried by Cs+, possibly flowing through the Ca 2 + channels. However, Ca 2 + channel blockade probed during the current decay with the fast application of 200 microM Cd 2 +, reduced the total current by about the same amount. This shows that the decay was not produced by the progressive increase of an outward flow of Cs+ through the Ca 2 + channels, reducing (or even cancelling) the Ca 2 + inflow. Rather, the decay of the total current was instead generated by the progressive activation of an outward current flowing through another channel type. In conclusion, prolonged depolarizations do not cause the full inactivation of the Ca 2 + current, but the decay of total current is mostly produced by the unblock of cationic channels (possibly selective to K+), carrying an outward Cs+ current, despite the presence of 20 mM TEA in all solutions...|$|R
40|$|Technology and {{collaboration}} enable dramatic {{increases in the}} size of psychological and psychiatric data collections, but finding structure in these large data sets with many collected variables is challenging. Decision tree ensembles like random forests (Strobl, Malley, and Tutz, 2009) are a useful tool for finding structure, but are difficult to interpret with multiple outcome variables which are often of interest in psychology. To find and interpret structure in data sets with multiple outcomes and many predictors (possibly exceeding the sample size), we introduce a multivariate extension to a decision tree ensemble method called Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (Friedman, 2001). Our method, multivariate tree boosting, can be used for identifying important predictors, detecting predictors with non-linear effects and interactions without specification of such effects, and for identifying predictors that cause two or more outcome variables to covary without parametric assumptions. We provide <b>the</b> <b>R</b> package 'mvtboost' to estimate, tune, and interpret the resulting model, which extends the implementation of univariate <b>boosting</b> in <b>the</b> <b>R</b> package 'gbm' (Ridgeway, 2013) to continuous, multivariate outcomes. To illustrate the approach, we analyze predictors of psychological well-being (Ryff and Keyes, 1995). Simulations verify that our approach identifies predictors with non-linear effects and achieves high prediction accuracy, exceeding or matching the performance of (penalized) multivariate multiple regression and multivariate decision trees over a wide range of conditions...|$|R
