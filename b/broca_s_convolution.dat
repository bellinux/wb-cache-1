40|$|Following up on {{an earlier}} {{positron}} emission tomography (PET) experiment (Indefrey et al., 2001), we used a scene description paradigm to investigate whether a posterior inferior frontal region subserving syntactic encoding for speaking is also involved in syntactic parsing during listening. In the language production part of the experiment, subjects described visually presented scenes using either sentences, sequences of noun phrases, or sequences of syntactically unrelated words. In the language comprehension part of the experiment, subjects were auditorily presented with {{the same kinds of}} utterances and judged whether they matched the visual scenes. We were able to replicate the previous finding of a region in caudal <b>Broca</b> <b>s</b> area that is sensitive to the complexity of syntactic encoding in language production. In language comprehension, no hemodynamic activation differences due to syntactic complexity were found. Given that correct performance in the judgment task did not require syntactic processing of the auditory stimuli, the results suggest that the degree to which listeners recruit syntactic processing resources in language comprehension may be a function of the syntactic demands of the task or the stimulus material...|$|R

Portanto, este trabalho teve como objetivo investigar, com mais acuidade, o espa?o ficcional nos contos desse escritor mineiro. Para tanto, analisamos as narrativas "Tati, a garota", "O telegrama de Ataxerxes" e "Viagem aos seios de Du?lia", presentes no livro A morte da porta-estandarte e Tati, a garota e outras hist?rias (1976), cujos espa?os, f?sico e social, sobretudo os das cidades, desempenham importante papel na composi??o das personagens, impulsionando-as a se deslocarem e a vivenciarem, cada qual a seu modo, certo n?vel de solid?o. Nossa perspectiva te?rica ? a da topoan?lise, defendida por Gaston Bachelard (2003), mas ampliada por Oz?ris Borges Filho (2007). Para fundamentar a nossa pesquisa, al?m da contribui??o desses autores, recorremos ?s percucientes reflex?es de Osman Lins (1976), de Yi-Fu Tuan (1980) e de Mikhail Bakhtin (2010), acerca do espa?o enquanto categoria anal?tica. Entretanto, como as narrativas analisadas se passavam preponderantemente no Rio de Janeiro achamos necess?rio tamb?m trazermos reflex?es tanto sobre cidade quanto sobre {{a capital}} carioca. Assim sendo, neste bloco, contamos com as reflex?es de Raquel Rolnik (2012), de Marshall Berman (2007), de Renato Cordeiro Gomes (2008), de Nicolau Sevcenko (1985), de Brito Broca (2005), entre outros escritores. Reading the {{academic}} papers about An?bal Machado`s work, {{we noticed that}} space, although {{it is an important}} narrative element, once, for many times, it acts in the stories either influencing on the character`s actions and attitude or modifying its way of being or living, has not been studied enough. Therefore, this work has the aim to investigate, with more acuity, the fictional space in the tales of this writer, born in the state of Minas Gerais. For that, we analyzed Tati, a garota, "O telegrama de Ataxerxes" and "Viagem aos seios de Du?lia" stories, present in the book A morte da porta-estandarte e Tati, a garota e outras hist?rias (1976), which physical and social spaces, especially the city ones, play important part on the characters composition, propelling them to dislocate and live themselves, each in their own way, certain level of loneliness. Topoanalysis is our theoretical perspective, defended by Gaston Bachelard (2003), but amplified by Oz?ris Borges Filho (2007). To justify our research, besides such authors contribution, we resorted to the Osman Lins (1976), Yi-fu Tuan s and Mikhail Bakhtin s insighful reflexions on space as analytical category. However, once the analyzed narratives took place preponderantly in Rio de Janeiro, we found necessary as well to introduce reflections both about city and about the capital carioca.

40|$|The model-based approach, {{used by the}} JeNo code {{to predict}} jet noise {{spectral}} directivity, is described. A linearized form of Lilley's equation governs the non-causal Green s function of interest, with the non-linear terms on the right hand side identified as the source. A Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solution yields the required mean flow for {{the solution of the}} propagation Green s function in a locally parallel flow. The RANS solution also produces time- and length-scales needed to model the non-compact source, the turbulent velocity correlation tensor, with exponential temporal and spatial functions. It is shown that while an exact non-causal Green s function accurately predicts the observed shift in the location of the spectrum peak with angle as well as the angularity of sound at low to moderate Mach numbers, the polar directivity of radiated sound is not entirely captured by this Green s function at high subsonic and supersonic acoustic Mach numbers. Results presented for unheated jets in the Mach number range of 0. 51 to 1. 8 suggest that near the peak radiation angle of high-speed jets, a different source/Green <b>s</b> function <b>convolution</b> integral may be required in order to capture the peak observed directivity of jet noise.

The kernels would normally be chosen to produce a decomposition into a &quot;useful &quot; set of subimages. In the case of noise coring, this will usually mean that the kernels are selective for orientation and scale, i. e. that they select out limited patches in the spatial frequency domain. For example, we might choose A 1 to select for vertical energy, A 2 to select for horizontal energy, and A 3 to select for diagonal energy, as shown by the spectra in figure 1 (a).

The variation in range of the initial reservoir pressure between the two methods is within acceptable limit. However, the reservoir permeability cannot {{be obtained from the}} convolution process because the data do not represent the extended reservoir area. The results show reduction in the permeability up to 20 % which is beyond the accepted range of practical errors. On the other hand, the deconvolution method has given a better result, after using the condition of a parallel fault even though it does not give a very close result with the circle result. It is to be noted that the convolution method can yield a very wrong estimate of the boundary identity, whereas the deconvolution technique can be more useful in the boundary identity. To accept the deconvolution technique results, a discreet consideration should be evaluated in retrospect of the past well history with the lost circulation, whereas the application of the convolution method needs more time stages to reduce the rate of flow by changing the choke size. Furthermore, the convolution method cannot truly forecast the reservoir capacity because the damage in the stimulation has created an assumption of a higher flow rate in excess of the reservoir actual capacity.|$|R
40|$|Amenability {{developed}} alongside modern analysis, {{as it is}} {{a central}} property lacking in a group used to show, for example, the Banach-Tarski paradox (Wagon, 1993). The first working definition was given by von Neumann (1929), in terms of finitely-additive measures. A number of useful theorems are capable of being shown using this basic definition. The firrst modern definition of amenability was given by M. M. Day (1957), whose concept involved invariant means. For groups this coincides exactly with the von Neumann condition: each invariant mean corresponds to an invariant finitely-additive measure, corresponding via Lebesgue integration. This advance was significant as it {{opened the door to the}} application of abstract harmonic analysis, fixed-point theorems, and an industry of consequences. Amenable groups support almost-invariant finite means, and via decomposition this is culminated as the Følner condition, a statement about finite sets. Abelian groups are amenable as a simple consequence of the Markov-Kakutani fixed-point theorem. A theorem of B. E. Johnson (1972) led to the development of amenable Banach algebras and C*-algebras, neatly encoding amenability in the mechanics of cohomology theory. While amenability is directly generalisable from groups to semigroups, the two key definitions do not correspond in the same way as they do for groups: extracting a finitely-additive measure from a left-invariant mean yields what might be called a left preimage-invariant measure, and for groups these merely correspond to the inverse elements. A simple but surprising consequence of Day’s definition of amenability is that semigroups with a zero element are both left and right amenable (Day, 1957). Yet they cannot support a (totally) invariant finitely-additive measure (van Douwen, 1992, p 231). On the other hand, all semigroups with more than one distinct left zero are not left amenable (Paterson, 1988), and in particular there are many non-amenable finite semigroups, which is another contrast to the group case: all finite groups are amenable. This standard definition of amenability for semigroups is therefore unintuitive and, perhaps, unsatisfactory. Restricting to better-behaved classes of semigroups, such as the inverse semigroups, does little to improve this. The first new result of the present work is that there is a weakening of invariance that can be used in the context of finitely-additive measures to generalise group amenability to semigroups in a different way. For a semigroup S, a finitely-additive measure 2 [0; 1]P(S) will be called left fairly invariant if, for all s 2 S and A S such that sjA is an injection, (sA) = (A). When a semigroup supports such a finitely-additive measure, then it is left fairly amenable. Fair amenability is a generalisation of group amenability, and retains some of the useful theorems. Some of the results shown using this formulation include: a semigroup is left fairly amenable when it satisfies a weakened Strong Følner Condition, finite semigroups are all fairly amenable, semigroups with involution are either fairly amenable on both the left and the right or not at all, adjoining a zero does not cause a non-fairly amenable semigroup to become fairly amenable, directed unions of fairly amenable semigroups are fairly amenable, and a variety of examples which are fairly amenable or not fairly amenable. The name “amenable” is, as the story goes, supposed to be a pun, since amenable groups support invariant means. Thus an important question for fair amenability is, what condition for a mean is equivalent to the fair invariance of the corresponding finitely-additive measure? One approach is to flip the duality between the convolution action in ℓ 1 (S) and the dual action in ℓ 1 (<b>S)</b> upside-down: attempt <b>convolution</b> in ℓ 1 (S) and the dual action in ℓ 1 (S). In this scenario, the curious will consider such ill-defined expressions as 0 S. Fortunately, wherever the convolution partial action of s on ϕ 2 ℓ 1 (S), i. e. s ϕ, is well-defined and bounded, then the integral with respect to a left fairly-invariant measure can be readily computed. It is shown that a semigroup S left fairly amenable if, and only if, there exists a mean m such that m(ϕ) = m(s ϕ) for all s 2 S and ϕ 2 ℓ 1 (S) such that s ϕ 2 ℓ 1 (S). Hence the nomenclature “fairly amenable” is justified as a pun also. Some variations on fair amenability and related results are also explored. As a variation on the * partial action, an operator ⊛ is introduced on ℓ 1 (S), which induces a full action of S. One drawback of⊛compared to *is that, in order to express fair amenability, an additional condition is required to limit the scope of invariance appropriately. Finally, inner ⊛ invariance and its “fair” variant are briefly explored...|$|R
