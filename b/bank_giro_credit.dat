Meanwhile there were <b>Bank</b> <b>Giro</b> <b>Credits,</b> which were instructions to credit a particular bank account: these were not instructions to debit another account, so they had to be accompanied with cash or cheques, and they could be used both for bill payments and as paying-in slips; when used for paying bills they were often free-of-charge to the payer when used at the payer's or payee's bank but with an administration charge at other banks.|$|R

This cost can be reduced if non-cash payments shift from paper to electronics since the {{cost of a}}n electronic payment is estimated to be from one-third to one-half that of a paper-based transaction. We examine the use of cash and five non-cash payment instruments in 14 developed countries over 1987 - 1993. Our purpose is (1) to outline the current use of check, paper <b>giro,</b> electronic <b>giro,</b> <b>credit</b> card, and debit card payments and (2) to determine why some payment instruments are used more intensively than others, especially electronic versus paper-based payments. Standard demand theory influences (own price and incomes, institutional factors, and simple availability measures across countries are examined, as is the effect of habit formation. Payment substitution relationships are also estimated and indicate that checks will decline with further growth of electronic payments while the instruments that make up electronic payments will tend to expand together rather than replace one another.

30|$|In {{the related}} literature, to our knowledge, {{the impact of}} {{transactions}} at POS terminals on the substitution of cash for electronic payment {{has not yet been}} specifically explored and its relationship with ATM adoption remains largely unknown. The consumer adoption and merchant acceptance patterns of cards have been relatively slow in many countries and the usage and diffusion of cards at the ATM and at the POS have somehow overlapped. Humphrey et al. (1996) estimated a system of demand equations for five payment instruments (check, electronic or paper <b>giro,</b> <b>credit</b> card, and debit card) for 14 countries between 1987 and 1993 and found that although all payment instruments except debit cards substitute for cash. This result suggests that the use of debit cards for ATM withdrawals and POS transactions may impose some restrictions on the substitution of cash for cards. Similarly, Amromin and Chakravorti (2009) study changes in transactional demand for cash in 13 OECD countries from 1988 to 2007, showing that ATM withdrawals decrease with greater debit card usage at the POS. Studies by Humphrey and Berger (1990) or Humphrey et al. (2000) have also shown that efficient payment instrument pricing induces greater use of electronic payments, as it is cheaper than paper-based alternatives.|$|R

Attempting to defraud the Swedish <b>Bank</b> <b>Giro</b> Central of 22 million kronor, Eriksson and Peter Uf, the other future executive of Gizmondo, were found guilty of fraud and counterfeiting. In 1993 and 1994, Eriksson was sentenced to ten years in prison, though he only served half his sentence. Court documents show Eriksson and a partner broke into a man's home, destroyed his property, and punched him repeatedly in the face. Eriksson also held a knife to the man's throat, threatened to cut off his fingers, and finally shoved a gun into the man's mouth.

40|$|The {{substitution}} of noncash (check, <b>giro,</b> and <b>credit</b> and debit card) payments for cash transactions {{is difficult to}} gauge {{because there are no}} data series on the actual value or volume of cash transactions in any country. However, determining the degree of cash substitution is important because it will negatively affect government seigniorage revenue and, if cash use falls fast enough, may require tax revenues to redeem excess currency holdings. We utilise a novel method for approximating the volume of cash transactions using public information on currency stocks and noncash payments. Applying this method, we estimate how cash has been substituted by other payment instruments in 10 European countries. We also provide a forecast of future cash use by country. We find that the trend in cash substitution across countries is quite similar. However, the countries themselves are at significantly different stages of this substitution process. The spread of debit and credit card payments has been the key factor behind the substitution away from cash as use of e-cash innovation is still in its infancy. Country-specific differences in the substitution process are largely explained by differences in the level of implementation of each country’s card payment technology. cash substitution; learning curves; seigniorage...|$|R

Different aspects {{of the use of}} {{information}} systems and information technology in early days in Swedish banks were discussed and debated at the seminar. The discussion started with the first routines that were automated using computers. In the begin¬ning the emphasis was on rationalization and to automate time- and personnel-consuming tasks. Examples of such routines were payrolls and interest calculations. Soon computers and information systems were used to develop new products for the customers. Concerning competition, the main groups of competitors were the savings banks and the commercial banks. While these two groups were com¬peting, within the groups {{there was a lot of}} cooperation, especially regarding technical infrastructure and building common systems. This cooperation led to Sweden being at the forefront in many areas. Being among the first coun¬tries Sweden started with com¬puterized inter-bank clearing in 1968.

50|$|Most infractions are {{punishable}} with a day-fine. For crimes warranting no {{more than}} six months in prison, the fine may be summarily ordered by the prosecutor if the suspect does not want the court to handle the case. The process of ordering a day fine is started by a police officer who makes a formal demand for the suspect to be fined. The suspect has one week to contest the demand. If the suspect does not contest the demand, the prosecutor may order a fine which may not be higher than demanded by the police officer. If the suspect contests the demand, the case may be taken to the district court if the prosecutor considers the suspect guilty. If the prosecutor considers the case to merit a term in prison or a higher fine, the case is always taken to the court. If the prosecution or the injured party do not demand a higher punishment than a fine, the district court has a quorum with a single member. The fine is paid to the <b>bank</b> using a <b>giro.</b> A fine ordered in Finland is executable in any European Union member country.|$|R
50|$|In 1921, Fischerkoesen {{launched}} {{a highly successful}} advertising career with an ad for the Leipzig shoe factory Nordheimer, Bummel -Petrus (Strolling Peter). In the same year he made another three animated advertising ads: Die Entführung and König Grogs Löwenabenteuer (both Transocean-Film) and Professor Sprit (Dux- Film). The success led to a two-year contract with Julius Pinschewer, owner of the leading Berlin advertising company Werbefilm G.m.b.H.-Pinschewer, who had pioneered the use of animated commercials in movie theatres back in 1911. As {{a result of this}} collaboration, he produced Die Besteigung des Himalaja (1923), Abbau auch im Harem (1924), Brand im Wolkenkratzer (1924), Glück auf! (1924), Der Glücksvogel (1924), Im Urwald (1924), Nunak, die Eskima (1924), Der Pfennig muss es bringen (1924), Sonnenersatz (1924), Das Zauberpferd (1924), Der kluge Dackel (1925), Jette’s Ausgang (1925), Meier glüht (1925), Der kluge Einfall (1925), Das Seegespenst (1925), Die Geschichte vom Scholokadenkasper (1926), Auf der Skitour (1926) and many other. Probably, the most important film of this period was Der Pfennig muss es bringen (The penny must bring it), an advertisement for the German Saving <b>Bank</b> and the <b>Giro</b> Co-operative <b>Bank</b> done in November 1924, which would fuel the later accusation of collaboration with the Nazi regime as both banks were to {{become an integral part of}} the Nazi plan for funding the war. Fischerkoesen worked for Pinschewer until 1928, when he temporarily worked for the propaganda film society “Epoche”, shortly after starting to work at Ufa’s (Universum Film AG) propaganda department. After becoming chief draughtsman, he established his own studio in Potsdam.|$|R
50|$|The biggest change, however, {{took place}} behind the scenes. Instead of {{focusing}} {{on the needs of}} the utilities (which had by this time already adopted the Giro) and the personal <b>banking</b> market, National <b>Giro</b> would aim to capture the cash deposit business then dominated by the commercial clearing banks. The Post Office itself was a major customer of the commercial banks. It had a constant need for cash in order for it to pay out social security payments (welfare payments and pensions). Bank notes and coin had to be obtained from the banks which charged a fee for this service. The banks were also charging the depositors of these notes and coin, all of which needed to be counted before being passed on to the Post Office (which itself then had extra costs in counting the money provided by the banks. The new system was brilliantly simple. Large depositors of cash (supermarkets, petrol (gas) stations etc.) would be encouraged through pricing to pay their cash into the Post Office. Post Offices are more convenient and open longer hours so there was a natural case for choosing the Post Office. What's more, the depositor would count the money once and seal it discrete envelopes of say, units of £100, £500 or £1000. The Post Office would take the money on trust, but commit to counting it not on receipt, but within a fixed period, of say 5 days. Thus within the Post Office, money could be handled very easily and its source was clearly marked. The money would be counted {{at the time it was}} needed (i.e. when the envelope needed to be opened). Discrepancies were reported to the Giro, so that any attempt at systematic fraud could be easily identified. And the Giro could charge both the depositor for the deposit and the Post Office as an internal charge for the provision of the cash. As these charges were lower than those being charged by the commercial banks, everybody was happy. The Post Office internal handling of cash also became much simplified by the handling of fixed value envelopes.|$|R
