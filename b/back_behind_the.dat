5|$|At dawn on August 9, 1st Cavalry Division {{learned of}} the North Korean crossing. North Korean {{infantry}} had gathered on Hill 268, also known as Triangulation Hill, which was 3 miles (4.8km) southeast of Waegwan and 10 miles (16km) northwest of Taegu. The hill was important for its proximity to lines of communication, as the main Korean north-south highway and the main double-track Seoul-Pusan railroad skirted its base. 1st Cavalry Division counterattacked the North Korean gathering to force them back across the river, but their initial assault was repelled. The next morning, August 10, air strikes and artillery barrages rocked Hill 268, devastating the North Koreans, who withdrew <b>back</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> river.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was born}} in Silsbee, Texas. As a child, {{he was a big}} wrestling fan and André the Giant was his {{favorite}} wrestler. While attending a wrestling show in Beaumont, Texas, young Henry tried to touch André as he was walking down the aisle, but tripped over the barricade. André picked him up out of the crowd and put him <b>back</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> barricade. When Henry was 12 years old, his father, Ernest, died of complications from diabetes. When he was 14 years old, Henry was diagnosed with dyslexia.|$|E
5|$|After half an {{hour the}} Russians finally stormed the ramparts of Fort 74 and {{defeated}} the Polish battalion defending it. This forced the Polish mobile artillery in Czyste, until then shelling the advancing Russian columns and their Grand Battery, to fall back. Meanwhile, the Russian right column was approaching Fort 72. Defended by only 200 men, the fort was approached by the Russian spearhead formed by the reinforced Nieśwież Regiment. Seeing this, the Polish commander ordered his cavalry reserve to charge the Russian infantry. Russian grenadiers stormed the ramparts of Fort 72, but were repelled and forced <b>back</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> moat, where the Polish cavalry charged them. The Russians formed infantry squares, but were defeated and forced to retreat. To counter the threat to Russian infantry, General Nostitz charged his own cavalry reserve under General Georg von Sass, and a cavalry battle ensued.|$|E

5|$|Dumouriez {{thought his}} soldiers' morale was too shaky for a retreat so he {{advanced}} on Coburg's army, seeking battle. In his haste, the French commander failed {{to call up}} Harville's corps or the Army of Holland as reinforcements. Earlier, François Joseph Drouot de Lamarche had been driven out of Tienen (Tirlemont), but on 16 March the French recaptured it after a vigorous combat. The French attacked Tienen with 10,000 troops while Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen defended the town with 6,000 soldiers, six guns and two mortars. French casualties numbered 500 while their opponents sustained losses of 800 killed, wounded and missing. Coburg pulled his army <b>back</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Little Gete River. Believing that he outnumbered his enemies, Dumouriez was very confident of success. A century before, the French had won the Battle of Landen on the same ground.|$|E
5|$|Reactivated on 5 May 1947 at Fort Lewis, Washington, {{the unit}} officially became the 36th Engineer Group on 10 April 1953. During the Korean War, the 36th Engineer Combat Group {{consisted}} of four engineer battalions and four additional engineer companies, earning two Meritorious Unit Citations and the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. It {{served in the}} Korean theater from 1950 until 1954, earning nine campaign streamers while supporting other army units in numerous engineering and construction projects, including rebuilding the Han river bridge just outside Seoul. During its assignment, the group was assigned to IX Corps of the Eighth United States Army. Projects that the group and its subordinate battalions completed included POW facilities, allied bases, and minefield clearing. Along {{with the rest of}} IX Corps, the group was forced <b>back</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Pusan Perimeter and remained stranded there until the Incheon Landings were conducted by X Corps. The group would follow IX Corps {{for the remainder of the}} Korean war.|$|E
5|$|Wellington quickly {{changed his}} plans after seeing his flank attack fail. He {{converted}} his holding attack with the 3rd and 6th Divisions into a head on assault. The new assault began around 11:30 am. The British commander sent every available unit against the French right flank and center. He held back only 2/95th Foot and 3/95th Foot, the Portuguese 3rd Caçadores Battalion and the 17th Line Infantry Regiment from the Light Division. The brigades of Ross and Vasconcellos were withdrawn {{and replaced by}} the 7th Division. The struggle for Saint-Boès broke out anew when Walker's division and William Anson's brigade of 4th Division attacked, supported by two British artillery batteries firing from the church knoll. Four battalions attacked in the center led by the 6th Foot. Two battalions were deployed {{to the left and}} John Milley Doyle's Portuguese brigade was on the right. Taupin's tired soldiers, who had been fighting for about four hours, were driven <b>back</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Plassotte knoll where they rallied.|$|E

5|$|Gardanne's men gave a good {{account of}} themselves, {{holding up the}} Austrian {{deployment}} for a considerable time. When Gardanne's division was exhausted, Victor pulled it <b>back</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Fontanone and committed his second division under GdD Chambarlhac (this officer soon lost his nerve and fled). The French held Marengo village and {{the line of the}} Fontanone until about noon, with both flanks in the air. First, at 8 am, Melas hurled FML Karl Joseph Hadik von Futak's division (four battalions) at Victor's defenses, supported by Frimont’s advance guard battery along the stream. Forced into a funnel by the bad ground and Fontanone stream, Hadik’s attack came under fire from two sides and failed, with Hadik being killed. The Austrian commander then committed FML Konrad Valentin von Kaim's division but this attack was also thwarted by 11 am. Finally, as the French position was reinforced by François Étienne de Kellermann's cavalry and Jean Lannes's formation was on the way, FML Ferdinand Johann von Morzin's elite grenadier division was sent in to attack Marengo village. Melas also committed a serious tactical blunder, detaching Generalmajor (GM) Nimptsch's brigade of 2,300 hussars and two artillery batteries back over the Bormida bridge to block the corps of General Louis Gabriel Suchet, which was mistakenly reported around 9 am from Acqui Terme to be approaching Alessandria from the south. Besides delaying the crossing of the Austrian left wing, this also meant that, being 30 kilometers away, Nimptsch's brigade would play no part in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{forces were}} making {{significant}} gains into Ottoman territory during the Caucasus Campaign. In {{an attempt to}} prevent further advances by the Russian army, Yavuz rushed 429 officers and men, a mountain artillery battery, machine gun and aviation units, 1,000 rifles, and 300 cases of munitions to Trebizond on 4 February. On 4 March, the Russian navy landed a detachment of some 2,100 men, along with mountain guns and horses, {{on either side of}} the port of Atina. The Turks were caught by surprise and forced to evacuate. Another landing took place at Kavata Bay, some 5miles east of Trebizond, in June. In late June, the Turks counterattacked and penetrated around 20miles into the Russian lines. Yavuz and Midilli conducted a series of coastal operations to support the Turkish attacks. On 4 July, Yavuz shelled the port of Tuapse, where she sank a steamer and a motor schooner. The Turkish ships sailed northward to circle <b>back</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Russians before the two Russian dreadnoughts left Sevastopol to try to attack them. They then returned to the Bosphorus, where Yavuz was docked for repairs to her propeller shafts until September.|$|E

Here, the barricades had been sealed and locked as instructed.

After its failed Siege of Burgos, the 35,000-man Allied army withdrew to the west, pursued by Souham's 53,000 French soldiers. On 23 October, French cavalry attacked the Allied rear {{guard in the}} inconclusive Battle of Venta del Pozo.

25|$|In early May, Bonaparte's French army won {{the battles}} of Fombio and Lodi and overran the Austrian {{province}} of Lombardy. Beaulieu evacuated Milan {{except for a}} 2,000-man garrison that he left in the citadel. In mid-May, the French occupied Milan and Brescia. At this time, the army had to pause to put down a revolt in Pavia. At the village of Binasco, the French atrociously massacred the adult male population. Beaulieu pulled his army <b>back</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Mincio, with strong patrols west of the river. He urgently {{tried to put the}} fortress of Mantua into a state where it could sustain a siege.|$|E
25|$|Wellington {{raised the}} siege of Burgos on 21 October. He quietly slipped away, undetected by the French until late on 22 October. The drawn Battle of Venta del Pozo was fought on the 23rd. The bulk of the Allied army fell <b>back</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Pisuerga River at Torquemada that day. Between 25 and 29 October, Souham and Wellington fought a series of actions along the Pisuerga and Carrión Rivers at Palencia, Villamuriel de Cerrato, and Tordesillas which are collectively called the Battle of Tordesillas. When the French seized the bridge over the Duero River at Tordesillas on the 29th, Wellington was {{compelled}} to order a retreat.|$|E
25|$|In fact, the French {{government}} {{approved a}} strategy that sent the Army of Italy north across the Brenner Pass to link with General of Division Jean Moreau's army in Bavaria. Accordingly, General of Division Bonaparte planned to mass 33,000 soldiers from the divisions of Generals of Division Claude Belgrand de Vaubois, André Masséna, and Pierre Augereau, then advance to Trento. His remaining 13,500 men covered the blockade of Mantua and {{the line of the}} Adige near Verona and Legnago. Bonaparte instructed Sahuguet and General of Division Charles Kilmaine to leave a garrison in Peschiera del Garda and fall <b>back</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Oglio River if they were unable to resist an Austrian attack from the east.|$|E
