50|$|In 1973 Steinlager was {{launched}} in the United States and an American consultant suggested that to become successful the company should change the colour of their bottles to match that of other premium beers. As a result, the original brown <b>bottle</b> <b>colour</b> was changed to green.|$|E
50|$|Production ceased in 1939 {{due to lack}} of raw {{materials}} and was restarted in December 1949. The drink is usually associated with its portion-sized 20 ml bottle, designed in 1949 by Emil Underberg, grandson of the founder. The mini-bottle is protected by a straw paper sleeve, and the embossed Underberg label is glued on. All of its elements, including shape of the <b>bottle,</b> <b>colour,</b> packaging and the Underberg name are trademarked and copyrighted.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, {{another beer}} bearing the Steinlager name was introduced. Steinlager Blue was marketed using an {{advertising}} campaign featuring The Blues Brothers. The two different tasting beers {{were known as}} Steinlager Blue or Steinlager Green which related to the colour of the bottle or can it came in (although Steinlager Blue was sold in a brown bottle). Steinlager Blue was discontinued in the later 1990s, leaving just Steinlager Green which then dropped the green from the name. Note the only reason Steinlager Blue & Green tasted different was the <b>bottle</b> <b>colour.</b> Beers bottled in green or clear bottles degrade under UV light. Both Steinlager beers were brewed in the same vat.|$|E
50|$|In 1972 the {{building}} of the new Dartford West Secondary Girls School began. It was built on the school playing fields, leaving the school with only one hockey pitch. Male staff were re-introduced in the 1970s. During that decade, the wearing of hats was abolished as well as the changing into indoor shoes requirement. The uniform was now changed to its current <b>bottle</b> green <b>colour.</b> An open-air swimming pool was built in 1975.|$|R

The <b>colour</b> coding for plastic milk bottle tops can be {{different}} from that of glass bottles. In the United Kingdom, the plastic tops on plastic milk bottles are normally coloured: ...|$|R
50|$|Derriksite is a {{very rare}} uranium mineral with the {{chemical}} formula Cu4(UO2)(SeO3)2(OH)6•H2O. It is a secondary mineral that contains copper, uranium and the rarer selenium. It is a bright green to duller <b>bottle</b> green <b>colour.</b> Its crystal habit is acicular, it {{is most likely to}} be found along with the uranyl selenium mineral demesmaekerite, but derriksite is much rarer than demesmaekerite. It is named after Jean Marie Francois Joseph Derriks (1912-1992), geologist and administrator of the Union Minière du Haut Katanga (UMHK). It has a Mohs hardness of about 2.|$|R
40|$|Purchasing of wine {{involves}} many tangible and intangible product features. The {{more tangible}} features include {{the shape of}} the <b>bottle,</b> <b>colour</b> of wine and the price. The intangible product features include taste, smell and grape type. Spawton (1991) discusses consumer expectations and risk-reduction strategies in the purchase of wines. Spawton (1991) refers to a four-segment model of the market. These segments include Connoisseurs, Aspirational Drinkers, Beverage Wine Consumers and New Wine Drinkers. Spawton’s (1991) four segments were empirically tested in this study and validate...|$|E
40|$|Exposure of a Chardonnay wine {{to light}} from a mercury vapour lamp under {{controlled}} temperature conditions showed that colour enhancement was dependent on <b>bottle</b> <b>colour.</b> The increase in colouration was Antique Green < French Green < Arctic Blue < Flint, {{in agreement with the}} transmission characteristics of each bottle type. Xanthylium pigments were identified as one component contributing to the observed enhancement of colour. The presence of oxygen was shown to be a critical factor to initiate the formation of these xanthylium pigments during light exposure. Without temperature control, wine colour development was highest in Antique Green and lowest in Flint. This alternate order reflects the ability of the darker bottles to retain heat longer than lighter coloured ones as confirmed by surface temperature decay rates. Specific pigments contributing to the wine colour enhancement in uncontrolled temperature/light exposure experiments could not be identified, although tentative evidence was obtained for the presence of flavan- 3 -ol based compounds. The different bottle glass surfaces did not influence the rate of loss of dissolved oxygen or oxidation of ascorbic acid. The potential to develop the results obtained in this study to identify markers for light and/or temperature exposure of white wines is discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
5000|$|On 6 May 2010, the KP Chair {{reminded}} {{all participants}} {{that they should}} maintain vigilance to ensure that Marange diamonds comply with the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. The five-page notice also included photographs and descriptions of rough diamonds from the Marange fields: [...] "On first sight, strong 'gravel' impression resembling rounded pebbles in a riverbed. Look like tumbled and abraded coarse chips of broken beer <b>bottles</b> with <b>colours</b> ranging from dark brown to black to darkish green. Most surfaces are matt (sic) and dulled with rounded corners and edges. Broken surfaces display 'metallic-like' lustre." [...] The report also contains photographs showing Marange diamonds {{in various stages of}} processing, so they can be recognized if they are mixed in with a legitimate diamond export.|$|R
5000|$|In 1954 the Star Twin was redesignated the Shooting Star {{with a new}} {{swinging}} arm frame and the engine further developed by reducing the stroke to 72.6 mm and increasing the bore to 66 mm, giving {{a slight increase in}} capacity to 497 cc. [...] By the end of production in 1961 the BSA Shooting Star was the culmination of the development of the BSA A7, with a deep <b>bottle</b> green <b>colour</b> scheme with light green tank, mudguards and side panels, it had an alloy cylinder head, a duplex cradle frame with {{swinging arm}} rear suspension, full-width light alloy hubs and 8-inch drum brakes. Engine compression was upgraded from 6.6:1 to 7:1 and power was up to [...] at 5800 rpm, with a top speed of just under 90 mph.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, Tymbark {{introduced}} its '"Fruit of the World", the new flavours gave its consumers {{a taste of}} exotic tastes such as kiwi, cactus, currant and many others. In 2004, Tymbark was the first company in Poland to introduce the aseptic bottling of juices and beverages into plastic <b>bottles</b> without artificial <b>colours</b> and preservatives. In the same year 2004, Tymbark saw a rise in customers of its [...] "Fruit of the World" [...] and {{introduced its}} new [...] "Premium" [...] range of nectars of different fruit.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{previous}} research has confirmed that wine packaging and labelling influence sensory wine evaluation, product associations and consumer choice, it is still unknown if they {{have an impact on}} the market price of wine. We report results from a hedonic price analysis of red wine scanner data from two US markets. While region of origin has the strongest impact on market price we also find significant price premiums and discounts for different label styles, label <b>colours,</b> <b>bottle</b> forms, closures and the presence or absence of front label information. Our findings give marketers valuable strategic insights on how to package and label wines to match consumer expectations for different price tiers. ...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis report {{contains}} the {{contribution to a}} beauty advisory mobile application design and development. The system was aimed to converge colour imaging science, new mobile technologies and a potential business within the cosmetics industry {{in order to provide}} recommendations on how to select the right cosmetic colour that matches best to one’s specific face skin. This project has been planned as a full digital beauty consultancy. However the core and starting point was to provide suggestions on selecting foundations, products of different formats such as liquid-based cream, powder or mousse, manufactured in human skin colour range to cover facial flaws. In this study, following the agile development principles, we mapped the user’s face skin colour to a series of foundation codes as the appropriate colour matches. The proposed method leading to these recommendations include performing colorimetric measurements on the foundations, employing a digital imaging system, colour image analysis, and colour difference calculations. User involvement as a key component throughout the design and development phase was fulfilled by surveying the users and integrating their feedbacks into the whole process. We were able to confirm {{that it is possible to}} use a foundation transparent bottle as a reference for colour calibration of the application pictures. Our experimental data resulted into promising recommendations while the system was tested under a controlled illumination and using a reasonably high quality camera. Whereas, in a more complex situation, under uncontrolled illumination using a mobile front-facing camera with low quality, having only one foundation <b>bottle</b> as <b>colour</b> reference; the helpfulness of the results dramatically decreased...|$|R
2500|$|Eggleston {{taught at}} Harvard in 1973 and 1974, {{and it was}} during these years that he {{discovered}} dye-transfer printing; he was examining the price list of a photographic lab in Chicago when he read about the process. As Eggleston later recalled: [...] "It advertised 'from the cheapest to the ultimate print.' The ultimate print was a dye-transfer. I went straight up there to look and everything I saw was commercial work like pictures of cigarette packs or perfume <b>bottles</b> but the <b>colour</b> saturation {{and the quality of}} the ink was overwhelming. I couldn't wait to see what a plain Eggleston picture would look like with the same process. Every photograph I subsequently printed with the process seemed fantastic and each one seemed better than the previous one." [...] The dye-transfer process resulted in some of Eggleston's most striking and famous work, such as his 1973 photograph entitled The Red Ceiling, of which Eggleston said, [...] "The Red Ceiling is so powerful, that in fact I've never seen it reproduced on the page to my satisfaction. When you look at the dye it is like red blood that's wet on the wall.... A little red is usually enough, but to work with an entire red surface was a challenge." ...|$|R
