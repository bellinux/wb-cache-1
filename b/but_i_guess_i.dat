500|$|Brad Park and Frank Mahovlich {{also criticized}} the booing. According to Park: [...] "We get nothing — not a dime for this. Brother, I'm sick". Other players were more sanguine. Dryden didn't lash {{out at the}} fans. [...] "I'm disappointed, but I can {{understand}} it. The fans wanted us to do real good, and they're frustrated we didn't. I didn't think I deserved to be booed. Tretiak frustrated us, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> didn't frustrate them enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Lochte said he {{was pleased}} with his {{performance}} at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships but feels that he can improve his times before the 2012 Olympics. [...] "Getting five gold medals is definitely great, but the times that I went, I know I could go a lot faster," [...] he said. [...] "There {{are a lot of}} places in my races that I messed up on that I could have changed and gone faster, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> have a whole year to make sure I have those perfect swims." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Could Fall in Love" [...] {{is similar}} to [...] "Dreaming of You" [...] in its lyrics. Many media outlets, {{including}} the Milwaukee Journal and Billboard magazine, called them [...] "confessional ballads", with an emotionally vulnerable narrator who wants true love but finds it unattainable. Tarradell believed [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] was an indirect response to Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., who forced her and Perez to end their relationship just because Perez was a rocker. Tarradell asserted that the words [...] "I know it's not right <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> should {{try to do what}} I should do" [...] were directed at Abraham and reflected Selena's realization of her independence. Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express-News believed that Selena's 1992 song [...] "Missing My Baby" [...] shared similarities with [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] in expressing uncontrollable [...] "adrenalin-fueled love". Burr later wrote that the difference in [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] is that the lyrics are recorded with [...] "powerful agony" [...] which forces the narrator to [...] "fall into a phase of deep loneliness" [...] because her lover may or may not reciprocate her feelings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fact," [...] {{said his}} lordship, nodding. [...] "Mind you, I don't know for certain. As the girl {{says in the}} song, <b>I</b> don't know, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> What <b>I</b> mean to say is, they seemed jolly friendly, and all that; calling each other by their first names, and so on." ...|$|R

500|$|The song {{begins with}} a brief {{introduction}} in which Eminem says while the chorus plays underneath, [...] "Yeh, it's been a ride. I guess I {{had to go to}} that place to get to this one." [...] When he begins the first verse, his lyrics threaten people who have looked down on him: [...] "You can try to read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em/ But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em." [...] On the second verse, Eminem says that he has indeed made mistakes, commenting on his Relapse album: [...] "That last Relapse CD was ehh/ Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground/ Relax, I ain't going to do that now." [...] When he says [...] "All I'm trying to say is get back, click clack, pow", a gunshot is heard. Approaching {{the end of the second}} verse, Eminem raps about his personal experiences: [...] "But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out/ Thought I had it mapped out, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> didn't/ It's time to exercise these demons/ These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now." [...] After the chorus, Eminem sings a bridge and focuses on a positive change, as he says [...] "I just can't keep living this way, so starting today I'm breaking out of this cage." [...] Before the final chorus, he says that he [...] "shoots for the moon". The song features a choir composed of Kip Blackshire, Christal Garrick II, Terry Dexter, Rich King, Kristen Ashley Cole and Sly Jordan.|$|E
500|$|Imperial Bedrooms {{opens with}} an {{acknowledgement}} from Clay, the main character, {{that both the}} Less Than Zero novel and its film adaption are actual representational works within the narrative of his life: [...] "The movie {{was based on a}} book by someone we knew... It was labeled fiction but only a few details had been altered and our names weren't changed and there was nothing in it that hadn't happened." [...] The Los Angeles Times described this as a [...] "nifty little trick", as it allows Ellis to establish the newer book [...] "as the primary narrative, one that trumps Ellis as author and the real world." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle calls it a [...] "neat trick of authorial self-abnegation". Another reviewer describes it as Ellis at [...] "his most ambitious", a [...] "Philip Rothian, doppelgänger gambit", making his new narrator [...] "the real Clay" [...] and the other an imposter. This allows Ellis to skilfully, [...] "with writerly jujitsu", acknowledge Robert Downey Jr.'s popular performance as Julian in the moralistic 1987 film, in which he died; Ellis appreciates the adaptation as a [...] "milestone in a lot of ways". The device also allows the novelist to insert self-critique; The Sunday Times reviewer notes that Imperial Bedrooms finds its characters [...] "still a little sore at their depiction as inarticulate zombies". John Crace, in his [...] "digested read" [...] of Imperial Bedrooms, insinuates through parody that [...] "the author" [...] of the metafictional Less Than Zero is also meant to be Ellis, describing him in Clay's voice as [...] "too immersed in the passivity of writing and too pleased with his own style to bother with many commas to admit it so he wrote me into the story as the man who was too frightened to love." [...] With regard to the opening narrative conceit, Ellis queries [...] "Is it complication ... or is it clarification?", opining that it certainly is the latter for Clay. Even though Ellis never names himself explicitly in the book, he conceded to Lawson that one can [...] "guess [...] is who the Clay of Imperial Bedrooms is referring to." [...] Ellis did, however, reveal that he had not decided when writing the novel whether Clay was referring to him or not. Eileen Battersby likened Bedrooms to Lunar Park (2005), cited his use of [...] "self-consciousness as a device." [...] This device was picked up on by several other critics—in particular, Vice noted that [...] "the scatological violence of American Psycho" [...] and [...] "the otherworldly terror of Lunar Park" [...] had here been combined. Ellis himself raised the [...] "sequel" [...] question, commenting [...] "...I don't think it is [...] Well, I mean, it is and it isn't. It's narrated by him, sure. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> could maybe have switched the names around and it could stand alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{began to}} read screenplays that were being made, and I {{hesitate}} to say this, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> read them and said: 'Christ, I could do that.'"

6000|$|He {{perceived}} the anxiety that the girl's pride {{could not keep}} out of her tone, but he answered indifferently, [...] "I'm a little too near that color myself.

2500|$|Mascis has {{described}} Bug as his least {{favorite of the}} band's albums. In an interview in 2005, after the original line-up had reformed, he said, [...] "Bug is my least favourite of all our records.

2500|$|Liberty University President Jerry Falwell, Jr., {{subsequently}} {{stated that}} it was not the position of the University nor officials that Democrats could not be Christians. The head of the College Democrats, Brian O'Nill Diaz, was quoted as saying he was baffled by the administration's decision, [...] "I {{want to be able to}} share the love of Christ, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> can't do that on campus because I'm a Democrat as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shanahan {{became a}} free agent {{following}} the 2005–06 season and subsequently signed a one-year, $4 million deal with the New York Rangers. After completing a successful nine-year stay in Detroit, he {{expressed a desire to}} move on in his NHL career, stating, [...] "It really came down to an instinct I had. Detroit has a great past and a great future ahead of them as well, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> just felt that maybe I was identified with the past {{a little bit more than}} the future." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'M all right." [...] Walker lighted a {{cigar and}} began to smoke, {{with his eyes closed}} to a fine {{straight}} line.

He was almost worried about me before the fourth day. I was so nervous the third night I called home and talked to friends for hours, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> once <b>I</b> got up and got started then things eased up.

2500|$|At {{the time}} of his {{retirement}} in November 1906, Wedge was the lightweight champion of Arkansas. Wedge, who was scheduled to fight Guy Buckles in front of 2,000 fans over six rounds on a sand bar south of Omaha, Nebraska, announced his retirement before the bout to devote his life to Christian service and then gave Buckles a religious tract and a New Testament. Buckles, who was insulted by Wedge's actions, punched Wedge on the nose, however Wedge refused to retaliate, choosing instead to [...] "turn the other cheek". However, after another blow from Buckles, Wedge indicated: [...] "I have not been told what to do next, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> can pound you to pulp without interfering with my conscience". In the ensuing altercation, both fighters were severely disfigured, but Wedge was adjudged the winner. Wedge indicated that he would pray for Buckles.|$|E

6000|$|... "I think, I behaved badly," [...] said Burnamy, and a {{movement}} of protest from Mrs. March nerved him to add: [...] "I could make {{out that it was}} not my business to tell him what he was doing; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it was; <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> ought to have stopped him, or given him a chance to stop himself.

[...] "We had decided never {{to go public with}} what had transpired behind closed doors. <b>But</b> now, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> need to speak up. In her interview, she (Delnaaz) hinted at me not being a faithful husband. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> never cheated on Delnaaz," [...] Rajeev said.

Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, saying [...] "Honestly, this is a pretty generic sitcom-style plot. A bit of corruption for one influential character here leads to further corruption amongst the innocent there. If it were a drama, it would get worse. It's a comedy, so it's easily fixed. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> as <b>I</b> grow older, I'm more forgiving of those generic plots. If it's done well—and Bob's Burgers has the characters to do it well—I'll like it.

[...] In March 1938, Casey appeared on Gabriel Heatter's radio program, broadcast on the Columbia network, to make his claim to being the famous [...] "Casey."
