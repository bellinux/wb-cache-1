5|$|As James and Scamper {{entered the}} arena that night, Scamper caught his bridle {{on the side}} of the gate, dislodging the Chicago screws. With no screws, the headstall broke loose from the bridle after she made the turn around the first barrel. When she strove for the second barrel, the bridle was hanging from the horse's mouth to down under his foot. Meanwhile, she is trying to hold that bit in his mouth. <b>But</b> <b>coming</b> to the third barrel, she has to turn his head loose.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) arrives at the hospital in San Diego where Scully introduces him to Emily. Mulder tells Scully that he had Melvin Frohike look into Emily's case: her surrogate mother is a woman named Anna Fugazzi (slang for fake), {{and there are no}} true records of how Emily came into the world. Mulder, along with Scully's family, attend a meeting regarding Emily's adoption at the San Diego Hall of Justice. Mulder tells the Judge that Emily was conceived from Scully's ova, which was taken from her during her abduction, which the Judge does not believe. Later, Scully receives a call from the County Children's Center that cuts off abruptly. She and Mulder head there, where they find Emily safe, <b>but</b> <b>coming</b> down with a fever. They find a greenish cyst on the back of Emily's neck. Later, when a nurse pierces the cyst with a needle, green liquid comes out, causing her to become gravely ill, yet Emily appears unaffected. Mulder believes that Emily has the same body chemistry that they have seen before with alien-human hybrids.|$|E
5|$|French {{fire was}} {{taking its toll}} on the British ship, and at 22:20, Amethysts {{mizzenmast}} was shot through and collapsed on the quarterdeck, smashing the wheel and impeding Seymour's command of his ship. Thétis began to pull ahead and Pinsum attempted to rake Amethyst in her disorganised state, turning sharply to starboard <b>but</b> <b>coming</b> to a sudden halt as her own mizzenmast collapsed. With their ability to manoeuvre severely hindered, Amethyst and Thétis gradually closed on one another, Pinsum ordering the soldiers on his frigate to board the British vessel and capture her, while Seymour prepared for the eventuality by loading his cannon with two roundshot and his carronades with double loads of grapeshot. At 23:00, Pinsum suddenly swung his frigate towards Amethyst, the bows colliding and rebounding and the French stern swinging towards the British. At his signal, the soldiers and sailors crowded onto the deck and railings, ready to leap onto the British ship and engage her crew in hand-to-hand combat. With seconds remaining, Seymour ordered his gunners to fire. The double-shotted broadside, fired at point-blank range, killed or wounded over 100 men, including most of the officers. Only four guns were still serviceable on Thétis, which was set alight in three places due to {{the proximity of the}} British muzzle flashes.|$|E

25|$|The tram fare up Derby Rd was 2d, <b>but</b> <b>coming</b> down it was 1d. The {{journey from}} the Market place to Basford took one hour ten minutes and to extend the service to Bulwell, the company {{provided}} its own horse buses to transport passengers from the Basford tram terminus.|$|E

25|$|With South Africa out of Test cricket, England {{was arguably}} the best cricket team {{in the world at}} this point of time.

25|$|England's chase was {{interrupted}} once by rain, after three overs, {{when they were}} eight for 0, <b>but</b> <b>coming</b> back they were set 200 to win in 33 overs.

25|$|By early 1861, settler {{opinion was}} evenly divided on Browne's stance against Māori and the {{fairness}} of the Waitara purchase and many believed the British had little hope of wearing the enemy down with further military campaigns. Even Pratt expressed doubts the war could be won. The district had also suffered great economic hardship, with emigration all <b>but</b> <b>coming</b> to a stop and the destruction of three-quarters of farmhouses at Omata, Bell Block, Tataraimaka, and settlements nearer the town.|$|E

25|$|The 1976 All Blacks tour of South Africa went ahead, and the Springboks won {{by three}} Tests to one, <b>but</b> <b>coming</b> {{shortly after the}} Soweto riots the tour {{attracted}} international condemnation. Twenty eight countries boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics in protest, and in 1977 the Gleneagles Agreement discouraged any Commonwealth sporting contact with South Africa. In response to the growing pressure, the segregated South African rugby unions merged in 1977. A planned 1979 Springbok tour of France was blocked by the French government.|$|E
25|$|The Australia A cricket team toured Pakistan in September 2005. Australia A are a {{team made}} up of the second tier of Australian cricketers, just below the {{national}} team. They played two first class games against Pakistan A, one which they lost by seven wickets, and one draw. In addition, they played three one-day games before departing Pakistan, chasing down a total winning the first by seven wickets, losing the other by eight wickets and 14 overs, <b>but</b> <b>coming</b> back to take a 97-run win in the third.|$|E
25|$|In {{the time}} of Caesar, {{southern}} Germany was Celtic, <b>but</b> <b>coming</b> under pressure from Germanic groups led by the Suebi. As described later by Tacitus, what is today southern Germany between the Danube, the Main river, and the Rhine had been deserted by the departure of two large Celtic nations, the Helvetii in modern Schwaben and the Boii further east near the Hercynian forest. In addition, also near the Hercynian forest Caesar believed that the Celtic Tectosages had once lived. All of these peoples had {{for the most part}} moved by {{the time of}} Tacitus. Nevertheless, Cassius Dio wrote that the Suebi, who dwelt across the Rhine, were called Celts, which could mean that some Celtic groups were absorbed by larger Germanic tribal confederations.|$|E

25|$|Black began 2007 with RQW's No Pain, No Gain event, {{having to}} defend her Women's Championship against American wrestlers Cheerleader Melissa and MsChif but went on to lose singles matches against both of them, first to MsChif the next day for 3 Count Wrestling. The day after {{this was the first}} ChickFight to be held in the UK where Black {{advanced}} to the finals of a three-round tournament after defeating Daizee Haze and Lacey, <b>but</b> <b>coming</b> up short against Melissa. Her feud with Melissa continued at RQW's Taking on the World where she tagged with fellow Melissa enemy MsChif to take on the Cheerleader and her own long-standing rival Jetta. The match also served as a warm up for ChickFight VIII where Black was booked to meet Melissa again to crown the first TransAtlantic Champion; Black came out on the losing end of both matches.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Bau, or the Battle of Gunong Tepoi, was an {{engagement}} that occurred on 21 November 1965 {{in the border}} area of Sarawak in Borneo between British and Indonesian forces. It {{was part of the}} wider Indonesian–Malaysian confrontation, that consisted of a series of small-scale engagements involving Indonesia, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and which took place over the course of 1962–66. The engagement involved an attack by a 16-man advance squad of British Army Gurkhas on a company-sized Indonesian position. The Gurkhas were then supported by the 104 men {{in the rest of the}} company which resulted in the last Indonesians withdrawing after having virtually been destroyed. The Gurkha company, having suffered relatively light casualties <b>but</b> <b>coming</b> under increasing pressure from another Indonesian company nearby, retired from the position. As a result of the action, one Gurkha—Lance Corporal Rambahadur Limbu—received the Victoria Cross.|$|E
25|$|His chief song-cycles of {{this period}} were his {{settings}} of the Liederkreis of Joseph von Eichendorff, Op. 39 (depicting a series of moods relating to or inspired by nature); the Frauenliebe und -leben of Chamisso, Op. 42 (relating {{the tale of a}} woman's marriage, childbirth and widowhood); the Dichterliebe of Heine, Op. 48 (depicting a lover rejected, <b>but</b> <b>coming</b> to terms with his painful loss through renunciation and forgiveness); and Myrthen, a collection of songs, including poems by Goethe, Rückert, Heine, Byron, Burns and Moore. The songs Belsatzar, Op. 57 and Die beiden Grenadiere, Op. 49, both to Heine's words, show Schumann at his best as a ballad writer, although the dramatic ballad is less congenial to him than the introspective lyric. The Opp. 35, 40 and 98a sets (words by Justinus Kerner, Chamisso and Goethe respectively), although less well known, also contain songs of lyric and dramatic quality.|$|E

25|$|In October, Akebono and Choshu {{participated in}} the 2006 G1 Tag League, {{advancing}} to the last round before losing to Takashi Iizuka and Yuji Nagata. In August 2007, Akebono {{participated in the}} G1 Climax tournament defeating the likes of Togi Makabe and Hiroyoshi Tenzan, <b>but</b> <b>coming</b> up short in the end. In October, Akebono and Masahiro Chono competed in the 2007 G1, beating Hirooki Goto and Milano Collection AT, Naofumi Yamamoto and Takashi Iizuka and Manabu Nakanishi and Yuji Nagata, but were eliminated in the final stage by Giant Bernard and Travis Tomko. During his stay at New Japan, Akebono began to show his comedic side and began imitating and parodying other fighters. On 13 September 2006, Akebono was presented with a tiger mask {{and the name of}} Bono Tiger to team with Tiger Mask IV. On 4 March 2007, he made a brief appearance in Michinoku Pro Wrestling as The Great Bonosuke, fighting on the side of The Great Sasuke wearing the same outfit. On 17 February 2007, Akebono briefly returned to All Japan Pro Wrestling to team with Toru Owashi against Johnny Dunn and SUMO Rikishi in an extravagant match between sumos, resulting in a win for his team. After training with Satoru Sayama (the original Tiger Mask) in MMA and pro wrestling, he returned to the New Japan ring to participate in the 2007 G1 Climax tournament. He defeated Togi Makabe and Hiroyoshi Tenzan but failed to progress to the semifinal stage.|$|E
500|$|After having waited most of {{the night}} with no sign of any British troops (and {{wondering}} if Paul Revere's warning was true), at about 4:15 a.m., Parker got his confirmation.

[...] He knew that {{most of the}} colonists' powder and military supplies at Concord had already been hidden. [...] No war had been declared.

500|$|On review {{aggregator}} Rotten Tomatoes, {{the film}} has an approval rating of 65% based on 281 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Brutal and breathless, Quantum Of Solace delivers tender emotions along with frenetic action, <b>but</b> <b>coming</b> {{on the heels of}} Casino Royale, it's still a bit of a disappointment." [...] On Metacritic, which assigns an average rating to reviews, {{the film has}} a score of 58 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews". Critics generally preferred Casino Royale, but continued to praise Craig's depiction of Bond, and agree that the film is still an enjoyable addition to the series. The action sequences and pacing were praised, but criticism grew over the realism and serious but gritty feel that the film carried over.|$|E
