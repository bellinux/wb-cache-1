5|$|Leccinum holopus, {{commonly}} known as the white <b>birch</b> <b>bolete,</b> white bog bolete, or ghost bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae found in northern Asia, Europe, and northeastern North America. It associates with birch trees and is typically found in boggy or swampy areas, often growing among sphagnum moss.|$|E

50|$|Leccinum scabrum, {{commonly}} known as the rough-stemmed bolete, scaber stalk, and <b>birch</b> <b>bolete,</b> is an edible mushroom in the family Boletaceae, and was formerly classified as Boletus scaber. The <b>birch</b> <b>bolete</b> is widespread in Europe, in the Himalayas in Asia, and elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, occurring only in mycorrhizal association with birch trees. It fruits from June to October. This mushroom is also becoming increasingly common in Australia and New Zealand where it is likely introduced.|$|E
50|$|The <b>birch</b> <b>bolete</b> is edible and is {{especially}} enjoyable pickled in brine or vinegar. It is used also in mixed mushroom dishes, fried or steamed.|$|E

50|$|Two of {{the best}} common edible boletes, however, are the bay bolete (Boletus badius), whose pores bruise blue-green, and the orange <b>birch</b> <b>bolete,</b> which is a Leccinum with an orange cap and which bruises a bluish grey.|$|E
50|$|Leccinum versipelle, {{also known}} as Boletus testaceoscaber or the orange <b>birch</b> <b>bolete,</b> is a common edible {{mushroom}} (given the right preparation) in the genus Leccinum. It is found below birches from July through to November, and turns black when cooked.|$|E
50|$|The {{flesh is}} whitish, later more gray-white {{and does not}} change color when broken. In young specimens, the meat is {{relatively}} firm, but it very soon becomes spongy and holds water, especially in rainy weather. When cooked, the meat of the <b>birch</b> <b>bolete</b> turns black.|$|E

50|$|The forest {{provides}} food, nest {{sites and}} protection from predators for several bird species. Year round residents include common redpoll, wren, goldcrest, willow ptarmigan, and common raven. In summer the forest fills with redwings, snipes and meadow pipits along with Eurasian woodcocks and wagtails. Besides birding, the forest offers opportunities for botanizing and picking berries and mushrooms. Edible mushrooms include larch bolete, <b>birch</b> <b>bolete,</b> and slippery jack. Rock bramble is common and raspberries and redcurrants {{can be found}} in parts of the forest. Clear streams form a characteristic part of the forest and the water in all of them is drinkable.|$|E

40|$|Mercury content {{has been}} {{determined}} separately in the caps, stalks and whole fruiting bodies of thirteen species of popular wild edible mushrooms of the genus Boletus, Xerocomus, Leccinum, Suillus, Tricholoma, Rozites, Sarcodon and Cantharellus collected from Augustowska Forest, which is located in an unpolluted region in the northeastern part of Poland. The mushroom samples were collected {{in the summer and}} autumn of 1997 and 1998. Mercury measurements were by cold-vapour atomic absorption spectroscopy (CV-AAS) after wet digestion of the samples with concentrated nitric acid in closed PTFE vessels in a microwave oven. For each species 16 pooled samples were examined. Pinewood King Bolete Boletus pinophilus, King Bolete Boletus edulis, Scaly Tooth Sarcodon imbricatus, Gypsy Rozites caperatus, and Or-ange <b>Birch</b> <b>Bolete</b> Leccinum versipelle were the most contaminated with mean concentrations of 2, 000 ± 800; 2, 300 ± 1, 100; 2, 300 ± 500; 1, 200 ± 300 and 720 ± 380 in the caps and of 850 ± 390; 1, 000 ± 500; 1, 100 ± 400; 470 ± 150 and 420 + 170 ng/g dry matter in the stalks, respectively. For the other mushroom species exam-ined the mean mercury concentration were < 260 ± 80 ng/g in the caps and < 170 ± 40 ng/g in the stalks, while the fruiting bodies of Common Cantharelle Cantharellus cibarius were the least contaminated, i. e. the range was between 8. 0 and 24 ng/g and the mean 14 ± 4. These findings suggest that mushrooms from August-owska Forest indicate background contamination by mercury. Nevertheless, some of the mushroom species may posses a specific health risk when frequently consumed due to elevated mercury concentrations...|$|E
