2500|$|A new {{approach}} to avoiding overhead wires is taken by the [...] "second generation" [...] tram/streetcar system in Bordeaux, France (entry into service of the first line in December 2003; original system discontinued in 1958) with its APS (alimentation par sol – ground current feed). This involves a third rail which is {{flush with the surface}} like the tops of the running rails. The circuit is divided into segments with each segment energized in turn by sensors from the car as it passes over it, the remainder of the third rail remaining [...] "dead". Since each energized segment is completely covered by the lengthy articulated cars, and goes dead before being [...] "uncovered" [...] by the passage of the vehicle, there is no danger to pedestrians. This system has also been adopted in some sections of the new tram systems in Reims, France (opened 2011) and Angers, France (also opened 2011). Proposals are in place for a number of other new services including Dubai, UAE; Barcelona, Spain; Florence, Italy; Marseille, France; Gold Coast, Australia; Washington, D.C., U.S.A.; <b>Brasília,</b> <b>Brazil</b> and Tours, France.|$|E
