40|$|Freno AB in Piteå has {{developed}} a tractor with a semi-trailer based on a Volkswagen Crafter chassis. The modifications of the vehicle that are included in this thesis work covers the parking brake system of the semitrailer, the rear underrun protection device of the tractor and the maneuvering of the trailer’s service brake. The manufacturer of the tractor requests an independent analysis of whether these modifications have negative influences on the vehicle. A description of the parking brake system was made and its function was analyzed using force and torque equilibrium. The parking brake of the semi-trailer is maneuvered by an electric signal from the switch controlling the parking <b>brake</b> <b>indicator</b> on the dash board. The results were compared with regulations applicable by {{the date of the}} vehicle’s service entry. In theory, the parking brake meets the legal requirement to keep the vehicle stationary in a hill with 16 % slope and the design requirement of 18 %. Regulations regarding the rear underrun protection were studied and the company’s contact person was interviewed about the modification’s procedure. The underrun protection device has been moved forwards due to the shortening of the rear overhang. No modification has been made to the device itself that can affect its strength. According to EU Directive 70 / 221 /EC, rear underrun protection is not necessary for this vehicle type. For the maneuvering system of the semi-trailer’s service brakes, the designer was interviewed and a system description was formulated. The trailer’s service brakes are maneuvered by a directional valve connected to the tractor’s brake circuits. This valve is the only interface between the tractor and the semitrailer brake circuits. The maximum consumption of brake fluid caused by the directional valve is 0. 3 cm 3. A test method was produced to determine if pressure variations caused by the semi-trailer’s ABS system can be measured in the tractors brake circuits. The measurements are to be implemented with a pressure sensor connected to the master brake cylinder and a data logger which measures the brake pressure during a braking operation. Based on the recorded data the process can be analyzed. The test methodology was inspired by the test made to the vehicle by the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI) according to Directive 71 / 320 /EC.

500|$|In 1969, the Greek {{military}} junta agreed to procure {{a total of}} 190 AMX-30s and 14 AMX-30Ds, making Greece the first foreign nation to purchase the French tank. Throughout the 1960s, Spain had considered both the AMX-30 and the Leopard 1 to complement their existing fleet of M47 and M48 Patton tanks. Ultimately, Spain opted for the AMX-30 {{for a variety of}} reasons, including British unwillingness to sell the L7 tank gun to a fascist regime and the French offer to allow the AMX-30 to be manufactured in Spain. Spain ordered 19 tanks in 1970, and later agreed to manufacture another 180 tanks in Spain. In 1979, Spain began the production of a second batch of 100 tanks, completing a total of 299 AMX-30s issued to the Spanish Army; these were designated AMX-30Es. Spain also procured 10 AMX-30Ds and 18 AMX-30Rs. As production of the AMX-30E ended in 1979, the Spanish Army was already looking for a modernization program {{to improve the quality of}} the tank's mobility. In 1987, the Spanish Army began a six-year modernization program which brought 150 tanks up to AMX-30EM2 standards and modified another 149 tanks to AMX-30EM1 standards. The former was a much more complete upgrade, which saw improvements to the tank's mobility through the adoption of a new engine and gearbox, as well as to the tank's firepower, with the development of a new kinetic energy penetrator and the introduction of a far more complex and accurate fire control system for the tank's gunner, amongst other things. The AMX-30EM1 was termed a [...] "reconstruction" [...] and only saw improvements to the tank's mobility by adopting a new transmission and renovating much of the vehicle's worn out systems, such as the <b>brakes,</b> <b>indicators</b> and controls. These rebuilt AMX-30s were soon replaced by M60 Patton tanks procured from the United States in the early 1990s, while its fleet of AMX-30EM2s was later replaced by the B1 Centauro anti-tank vehicle.|$|R

5000|$|In December 2010, certain 2005-2007 model Acura RLs {{were subject}} to a safety recall for {{potential}} leaking of the brake master cylinder seal. [...] A seal in the brake master cylinder may be susceptible to damage following the use of brake fluid other than the recommended Acura or (Honda) Genuine DOT3 brake fluid. If the seal is damaged, it {{can result in a}} brake fluid leak under certain conditions. If a leak should occur, the driver might see a low <b>brake</b> fluid <b>indicator</b> light or a BRAKE FLUID LOW or CHECK BRAKE SYSTEM message. If the driver continues to drive the vehicle after receiving this message without refilling the brake fluid reservoir, it could result in a brake pedal that feels soft or spongy, and may eventually affect braking performance, increasing the risk of a crash. Affected vehicles were to be inspected and repaired, as applicable, at no charge. Reportedly, this recall applied to both 2005-2007 Acura RL and 2005-2007 Honda Odyssey models.|$|R

His first attempt at a motor cycle was fitting an engine of his own design to a Premier bicycle in 1901. This twin cylinder engine had steel cylinders with shrunk on aluminium radiator 'flanges', and drove the front wheel via friction directly to the tyre. He described the drive system as 'useless in the wet', and he could not prevent the cylinders from scoring. His next engine had cast iron cylinders of 2 1/4" [...] bore, and eventually drove by belt to clutch countershaft and then by chain to the rear wheel. Various ingenious ignition arrangements were used including link work driven by a pin placed mid-way on the connecting rod. In parallel to this he continued work on a 4" [...] bore, 4" [...] stroke marine engine which developed 10HP at 800rpm, fitted with a large water-cooled brake wheel (a dynamometer). By recording <b>brake</b> and <b>indicator</b> readings he was able to experiment with port shapes and piston shapes, developing the 'curved top' (deflector) piston.|$|R

50|$|The {{technology}} of the Tracer 900 comes directly from the MT-09, adding a partial fairing and windscreen, a bigger fuel tank, ABS brakes, handguards, centerstand, a 12-volt power socket, traction control, revised fuel map, and three riding modes. It also gains a dash, which {{is very similar to}} the XT1200Z Super Ténéré. The Tracer 900 utilises LEDs for the headlights, tail lights, <b>brake</b> lights, and <b>indicators.</b> The handlebars are significantly higher and wider, and are closer to the rider due to the seat being further forward, and the handlebars being further back than the MT-09, making for a much more upright riding position. The rear subframe is bigger and more robust and incorporates factory supports for lateral cases. The suspension has stiffer springs and more damping and preload than the MT-09.|$|R

As Cybercars are operated in non-dedicated environments the interaction with other either motorized or non-motorized, vulnerable road users becomes a crucial factor. We conducted a face-to-face interview study (N= 14, structured interview, 25 - 53 minutes) at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to investigate the expectations people have towards the concept of Cybercar and the interaction with Cybercars. On the one hand, results show that people prefer quite conservative interaction elements as known from conventional vehicles such as <b>braking</b> lights or <b>indicators</b> to predict the future behaviour of Cybercars. On the other hand, 53 % of the participants wish additional information like a stopping announcement of the Cybercar or whether pedestrians were detected or not. Based on the results we discuss how Cybercars could be designed to optimize the interaction and communication with other traffic participants...|$|R

5000|$|The body {{comprises}} 11 sections/panels, {{the centre}} tub section, nose cone, bonnet, front side panels, rear section, boot lid and all four wings. The centre section is reinforced with a steel cage {{for safety and}} rigidity. There is also a roll-over hoop welded into the section which is hidden under the head rest. This section attaches to the chassis by mounting point {{at the rear of}} the cage and also at the front in the footwells. The cage also holds the seat belt mounting points. The nose cone houses the grill and is in the style of 50s and 60s racing cars. The side panels can have either nothing, 3 mesh covered holes or a large exhaust hole at the top. An S6 models would usually have 3 mesh covered holes on the intake side and a large exhaust hole on the other side. A V12 model would usually have the three mesh holes on both sides and also an exhaust hole just underneath that. Some owners have opted for mixed options, mainly because of different exhaust systems. Most earlier models also had louvers near the bottom of each side panel. The side repeaters are also positioned on the side panels. The bonnet has a large, central scoop and, on most S6 models, a bump above where the intake sits as the carburetors need clearance and would contact the bonnet otherwise. The rear section consists of the head fairing, and fuel filler cap. On later cars (Mk.II specifically), there is also a boot in the rear section. The wings are fixed to the chassis and are positioned above each wheel. The front wings have the front indicators on. The rear wings have the rear lights, <b>brake</b> lights, <b>indicators</b> and reflectors. The number plate is mounted on the right rear wing. Body panels are made out of aluminium, carbon fibre or typically fibreglass (GRP) ...|$|R
40|$|While modal {{identification}} is a mature subject, very few studies address {{the characterization of}} errors associated with components of a mode shape. This is particularly important in test/analysis correlation procedures, where the Modal Assurance Criterion is used to pair modes and to localize at which sensors discrepancies occur. Poor correlation is usually attributed to modeling errors, but clearly identification errors also occur. In particular with 3 D Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer measurement, many transfer functions are measured. As a result individual validation of each measurement cannot be performed manually in a reasonable time frame and a notable fraction of measurements {{is expected to be}} fairly noisy leading to poor identification of the associated mode shape components. The paper first addresses measurements and introduces multiple criteria. The error measures the difference between test and synthesized transfer functions around each resonance and can be used to localize poorly identified modal components. For intermediate error values, diagnostic of the origin of the error is needed. The level evaluates the transfer function amplitude in the vicinity of a given mode and can be used to eliminate sensors with low responses. A Noise Over Signal indicator, product of error and level, is then shown to be relevant to detect poorly excited modes and errors due to modal property shifts between test batches. Finally, a contribution is introduced to evaluate the visibility of a mode in each transfer. Using tests on a drum <b>brake</b> component, these <b>indicators</b> are shown to provide relevant insight into the quality of measurements. In a second part, test/analysis correlation is addressed with a focus on the localization of sources of poor mode shape correlation. The MACCo algorithm, which sorts sensors by the impact of their removal on a MAC computation, is shown to be particularly relevant. Combined with the error it avoids keeping erroneous modal components. Applied after removal of poor modal components, it provides spatial maps of poor correlation, which help localizing mode shape correlation errors and thus prepare the selection of model changes in updating procedures...|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the aforementioned white military 750 cc Tiger Trail, the model came in one colour only, 'Sunburst Yellow', and featured yellow plastic mudguards and side panels. The petrol tank of the smaller two gallon 'USA' type in the same colour, had a stylised 'T' decal affixed on either side, the first use of main styling decals for Triumph. The tank had two Italian Paioli petrol taps for main and reserve. The 'semi-western' handlebars, braced and fitted with Dohertey rubber grips, together with the petrol filler cap, two-into-one exhaust system and silencer were black chromed. The tachometer was omitted, its pod being filled with a warning light panel and ignition switch. Braking was by the standard Automotive Products Lockheed 10.25 inch front brake and a newly introduced 7 inch single-leading-shoe rear drum <b>brake.</b> The turn <b>indicators,</b> not featured in the 1981/1982 brochure photo, were black plastic ULO items from Germany who also supplied the rear stoplamp. Also German were the rear view mirrors by Bumm. Rear suspension were Marzocchi 'Euro 74' units from Italy, at 335mm, 22 mm longer than either the standard Girling units or Marzocchi types later fitted to road models. The front suspension was the same as for road models albeit with gaitors fitted as standard and sharing the satin black finish for the range that season. The front wheel rim was 3.00 x 21 inches and like the rear, a 4.00 x 18 inch item, was a chromed item supplied by the Italian firm, Radaelli, both featuring security bolts and both shod with Avon Mudplugger dual purpose tyres. The headlamp was smaller than on the road models in size, its bucket finished in satin black and sporting a separate chromed mesh stone guard. The seat was a 3/4 length item, unique to the model. A black-painted bash plate was fitted to the underside of the frame stopping just short of the sump plate. The silencer was a cut-and-shut version of the standard roadster 'barrel' type. The centre stand was an optional item with only a sidestand originally supplied. Pillion footrests, too, were omitted, the high level silencer precluding passengers. Later production models cured this by fitting a wire guard to the silencer and a footrest extended out to clear the same. No passenger grabrail was ever fitted. Rider footrests were short, black-painted metal items that, unlike the roadster models, were not rubber mounted but could fold back against a spring.|$|R
