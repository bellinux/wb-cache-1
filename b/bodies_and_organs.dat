The interpretation of what is preserved depends partly on two issues that are interlinked: whether the animals were buried where they lived, or washed long distances by sediment flows; and whether the water at the burial sites was anoxic or provided enough oxygen to sustain animals. The traditional view is that soft <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs</b> could only be preserved in anoxic conditions, otherwise oxygen-breathing bacteria would have made decomposition too rapid for fossilization. This would imply that the sea-floor organisms could not have lived there. However, in 2006 Caron and Jackson concluded that the sea-floor animals were buried where they lived. One of their main reasons was that many fossils represented partially decayed soft-bodied animals such as polychaetes, which had already died shortly before the burial event, {{and would have been}} fragmented if they had been transported any significant distance by a storm of swirling sediment. Other evidence for burial where the animals had lived includes the presence of tubes and burrows, and of assemblies of animals preserved while they fed – such as a group of carnivorous priapulids clustered round a freshly moulted arthropod whose new cuticle would not yet have hardened. Fossilized swimming organisms were also buried immediately below where they lived.|$|E

40|$|Symmetry {{breaking}} {{is involved}} in many developmental processes that form <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs.</b> One {{of them is the}} epithelial rotation of developing tubular and acinar organs. However, how epithelial cells move, how they break symmetry to define their common direction, and what function rotational epithelial motions have remains elusive. Here, we identify a dynamic actomyosin network that breaks symmetry at the basal surface of the Drosophila follicle epithelium of acinar-like primitive organs, called egg chambers, and may represent a candidate force-generation mechanism that underlies the unidirectional motion of this epithelial tissue. We provide evidence that the atypical cadherin Fat 2, a key planar cell polarity regulator in Drosophila oogenesis, directs and orchestrates transmission of the intracellular actomyosin asymmetry cue onto a tissue plane in order to break planar actomyosin symmetry, facilitate epithelial rotation in the opposite direction, and direct the elongation of follicle cells. In contrast, loss of this rotational motion results in anisotropic non-muscle Myosin II pulses that are disorganized in plane and causes cell deformations in the epithelial tissue of Drosophila eggs. Our work demonstrates that atypical cadherins {{play an important role in}} the control of symmetry breaking of cellular mechanics in order to facilitate tissue motion and model epithelial tissue. We propose that their functions may be evolutionarily conserved in tubular/acinar vertebrate organs...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the insulin-signaling pathway controls <b>body</b> <b>and</b> <b>organ</b> size in Drosophila, and most metazoans, by signaling nutritional conditions to the growing organs. The temporal requirements for insulin signaling during development are, however, unknown. Using a temperature-sensitive insulin receptor (Inr) mutation in Drosophila, we show that the developmental requirements for Inr activity are <b>organ</b> specific <b>and</b> vary in time. Early in development, before larvae reach the "critical size" (the size at which they commit to metamorphosis and can complete development without further feeding), Inr activity influences total development time but not final <b>body</b> <b>and</b> <b>organ</b> size. After critical size, Inr activity no longer affects total development time but does influence final <b>body</b> <b>and</b> <b>organ</b> size. Final <b>body</b> size is affected by Inr activity from critical size until pupariation, whereas final organ size is sensitive to Inr activity from critical size until early pupal development. In addition, different organs show different sensitivities to changes in Inr activity for different periods of development, implicating the insulin pathway in the control of organ allometry. The reduction in Inr activity is accompanied by a two-fold increase in free-sugar levels, similar to the effect of reduced insulin signaling in mammals. Finally, we find that varying the magnitude of Inr activity has different effects on cell size and cell number in the fly wing, providing a potential linkage between the mode of action of insulin signaling and the distinct downstream controls of cell size and number. We present a model that incorporates the effects of the insulin-signaling pathway into the Drosophila life cycle. We hypothesize that the insulin-signaling pathway controls such diverse effects as total developmental time, total <b>body</b> size <b>and</b> <b>organ</b> size through its effects on the rate of cell growth, and proliferation in different organs...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey of}} parasites infecting Cape horse mackerel, Trachurus capensis Castelnau, 1861, {{from both the}} {{southern}} and northern Benguela ecosystems was conducted {{to test the hypothesis}} of discrete stocks in each subsystem. One hundred and twenty five T. capensis of two size classes were collected off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia and their <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs</b> were examined for parasitic infections. Differences in parasite assemblages between smaller and larger T. capensis within each subsystem, between T. capensis of each size class from the two subsystems, and between larger fish collected in different seasons within the southern Benguela, were assessed. A total of twenty-nine parasite species were found infecting T. capensis. Ten of these were identified to species level (Ceratomyxa australis, Davisia donecae, Ectenurus lepidus, Gastrocotyle trachuri, Goussia cruciata, Lernanthropus trachuri, Nybelinia lingualis, Rhadinorhynchus cadenati, Scolex pleronectis and Tergestia laticollis), three to genus level (Anisakis sp., Caligus sp. and Kudoa sp.). Significant spatial differences in T. capensis parasites were observed, with larger fish differing in infection intensity and abundance of Anisakis sp. and infection intensity of L. trachuri. Significant spatial variation in parasites was also observed in smaller fish, which differed in Anisakis sp. abundance, L. trachuri infection intensity and abundance, G. trachuri abundance and G. cruciata infection intensity and abundance. Significant fish size effects on T. capensis parasites were also observed in both subsystems. Anisakis sp. infection intensity and abundance and G. cruciata abundance differed significantly between larger and smaller fish from the southern Benguela. Larger and smaller fish from the northern Benguela differed in G. cruciata infection intensity and abundance, G. trachuri abundance and L. trachuri abundance. No seasonal differences in parasites of larger T. capensis from the southern Benguela were observed. By using a discriminant function analysis parasite abundance data correctly assigned 92 % of larger fish and 96 % of smaller fish to their respective southern and northern Benguela sub-populations or stocks. These results show that analyses of parasites can be used to infer population structure and support the hypothesis of distinct T. capensis stocks in the northern and southern Benguela subsystems...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an in-depth ethnographic mapping of deceased donation in a Catalan hospital. A unique site {{in terms of}} leading edge technoscientific practices, high rates of donation and its consolidated specialised team of transplant coordinators (TCs). The thesis situates donation as an embedded medical practice and traces the practicalities and specificities of making donation a possibility at the hospital. The empirical accounts offer a distinctive contribution that complements and challenges existing social sciences literature about donation. The latter have predominantly focused on donation as a controversial practice through highlighting the emotional experiences of donors’ families and individual medical practitioners involved. This empirical investigation mobilises, and further develops, STS material semiotics tools to provide an account of donation enacted as both procurement and healthcare. Ethnographic insights illustrate the shifting processes of mutual inclusion and exclusion that underpin the trajectory of integrating donation as a routinized hospital practice, along the recurring set of enduring tensions. This is achieved by following the work of TCs along the stages of donor detection, evaluation, maintenance, consent request and organ extraction. Crucially, the analytical focus decenters the individual actors’ perspectives, broadening {{the scope of the}} inquiry and making visible the complex sociomaterial arrangements that take place, inside and outside the hospital, which are rendered as a gradual process of assembling donations. Families’ consent to donation is essential but it is decentered, it is neither that which starts a donation process nor the only factor that contributes to the assembling of a donation process. Unlike available anthropological and sociological studies of donation this work is not about documenting the reductionist transition from patient to donor, whole to parts, person to thing and denouncing the fall from subject to object reified in donation practices. The emphasis here is on tracing the overlap between donors as patients, thus the analysis shows the shifting enactments of the embedded donor/patient configuration, which includes the donor/body, donor/person and donor/corpse figures simultaneously along the donation process. The intervention of bodies as active entities is examined through a speculative and pragmatic elucidation on the situated and relational enactments of responsive <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> <b>organs.</b> This thesis contributes to contemporary re/articulations of materiality and agency through the lens of distributed joint action and entangled actors from a nonanthropomorphic stance. The research also contributes to current policy debates in the UK, and in Scotland in particular, that propose to tackle the national problem of low donation rates with a legislative move to an opt-out system for donation. It offers robust empirical evidence to contest the dominant organ shortage problematisation that is reduced to the legal polarity of either opting in or out of donation. I suggest that questions about increasing donation rates cannot be restricted to the domain of individual choice as this excludes the situated medical practices that enable the choice of donation in the first place...|$|E

40|$|The {{regulation}} of static allometry {{is a fundamental}} developmental process, yet little is understood of the mechanisms that ensure organs scale correctly {{across a range of}} body sizes. Recent studies have revealed the physiological and genetic mechanisms that control nutritional variation in the final <b>body</b> <b>and</b> <b>organ</b> size in holometabolous insects. The implications these mechanisms have for the {{regulation of}} static allometry is, however, unknown. Here, we formulate a mathematical description of the nutritional control of <b>body</b> <b>and</b> <b>organ</b> size in Drosophila melanogaster and use it to explore how the developmental regulators of size influence static allometry. The model suggests that the slope of nutritional static allometries, the ‘allometric coefficient’, is controlled by the relative sensitivity of an organ's growth rate to changes in nutrition, and the relative duration of development when nutrition affects an organ's final size. The model also predicts that, in order to maintain correct scaling, sensitivity to changes in nutrition varies among <b>organs,</b> <b>and</b> within <b>organs</b> through time.
