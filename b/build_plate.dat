500|$|This was {{a limited}} edition of 50 {{vehicles}} released in late 2008 in the [...] "MY09.5" [...] model year. It was released alongside the limited edition 40 Years GTS. It was primarily to commemorate 20 {{years since the}} release of the SV88, one of the first vehicles released by the then new HSV outfit. There were 20 manuals (the first of the general run HSV E Series to use the TR6060 6 speed manual that had only been used in the W427 prior – straight from the current Corvette) and 30 autos. They were released in only 3 colours, Nitrate (silver) Sting (red) & Voodoo (blue). It was also the first VE model Senator to be officially released with a manual. Equipment levels & drivetrain were identical to the Senator Signature of the time. Unique features of the SV08 are: SV08 badging, 20" [...] Pentagon wheels, lower body gloss black accenting (ran along the doors at the same level of the black accenting on the front & rear), chrome mirror head & door handle accents, SV08 sill plates & SV08 <b>build</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

The aim of the research activities is to manufacture a base body of a tool using a tool steel powder. Tool's components with internal geometries, cavities or undercuts can be manufactured with a high build up rate by a Rapid Manufacturing process using a tool steel powder. After changing the powder the process can be continued to manufacture defined tool's geometrical elements using a WC-Co powder.

50|$|Borosilicate glass {{has become}} the {{material}} of choice for fused deposition modeling (FDM), or fused filament fabrication (FFF), build plates. Its low coefficient of expansion makes borosilicate glass, when used in combination with resistance-heating plates and pads, an ideal material for the heated build platform onto which plastic materials are extruded one layer at a time. The initial layer of build must be placed onto a substantially flat, heated surface to minimize shrinkage of some build materials (ABS, polycarbonate, polyamide, etc.) due to cooling after deposition. The <b>build</b> <b>plate</b> will cycle from room temperature to between 100 °C and 130 °C for each prototype that is built. The temperature, along with various coatings (Kapton tape, painter tape, hair spray, glue stick, ABS+acetone slurry, etc.), ensure that the first layer may be adhered to and remain adhered to the plate, without warping, as the first and subsequent layers cool following extrusion. Subsequently, following the build, the heating elements and plate are allowed to cool. The resulting residual stress formed when the plastic contracts as it cools, while the glass remains relatively dimensionally unchanged due to the low coefficient of thermal expansion, provides a convenient aid in removing the otherwise mechanically bonded plastic from the <b>build</b> <b>plate.</b> In some cases the parts self-separate as the developed stresses overcome the adhesive bond of the build material to the coating material and underlying plate.|$|E
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} {{has become}} a highly researched topic in recent years all over the world. The current research evaluates the merits of additive manufacturing based on the mechanical, microstructural, and fracture properties of additive manufactured AlSi 10 Mg test specimens. The additive manufactured <b>build</b> <b>plates</b> consisted of tensile and fatigue test specimens. They were printed in the 0 °, 30 °, 60 °, and 90 ° orientations relative to the build platform. Tensile and dynamic fatigue tests were conducted followed by microstructural characterization and fracture analysis. A wrought 6061 T 6 aluminum alloy was also tested for comparison. Tensile tests revealed similar ultimate tensile strengths for all aluminum tensile specimens (350 - 380 MPa). Fatigue strength was greatest for wrought 6061 T 6 aluminum (175 MPa). The fatigue behavior was a strong function of build orientation for the additive manufactured specimens. The 0 °, 30 °, and 60 ° orientations had fatigue strengths close to 104 MPa while the 90 ° orientation had a fatigue strength of 125 MPa. All test specimens failed primarily in a ductile manner. The effect of laser power, hatch spacing, and scan speed were also studied using microstructural analysis. Increasing laser power decreased grain size and void size. Increasing scan speed {{led to the formation}} of columnar grains. Increasing hatch spacing decreased grain size and the amount of voids present in the microstructure...|$|R

50|$|The RepRap Snappy is {{designed}} to address to core goal of the RepRap project of creating a general-purpose self-replicating manufacturing machine. The RepRap Snappy is able to create 73% of its own parts by volume with a design that eliminates {{as many of the}} non 3D printed parts as possible including belts and bearings which are replaced with a rack and pinion system. The name Snappy comes from the use of snap fit connectors used on the small printed parts to construct larger pieces, this both cuts down on the use of non 3D printed parts and means a smaller build volume is needed on the machine producing the parts. The only non self replicating parts on the printer are the motors, electronics, a glass <b>build</b> <b>plate</b> and one 686 bearing, the 3D printed parts take around 150 hours to create.

5000|$|The [...] "photosculpture" [...] method {{consisted}} of photographing a subject {{from a variety}} of equidistant angles and projecting each photograph onto a screen, where a pantograph was used to trace the outline onto modeling clay. In photo-polymerization, a vat of liquid polymer is exposed to controlled lighting under safelight conditions. The exposed liquid polymer hardens. Polymerization occurs when photopolymers are exposed to light when photopolymers contain chromophores, otherwise, the addition of molecules that are photosensitive are utilized to react with the solution to begin polymerization. Polymerization of monomers lead to cross-linking, which creates a polymer. Through these covalent bonds, the property of the solution is changed. The <b>build</b> <b>plate</b> then moves down in small increments and the liquid polymer is again exposed to light. The process repeats until the model has been built. The liquid polymer is then drained from the vat, leaving the solid model. The EnvisionTEC Perfactory {{is an example of a}} DLP rapid prototyping system.|$|E

This vector is consistently recreated by linking these three data-points and drawing the line". Vectored jetting is guided by the same principle. A start point, endpoint and radius of curvature {{is defined by the}} control software and the jet follows this path. With rasterized jetting, each point on the curve is strictly defined, so to make a complete curve, the print-head must move to each specifically defined spot, deposit material and move on. By its very nature, it must move, then stop, then move again. By utilizing a vectored path, the print-heads need not stop each time it deposits material onto the build area which results in smoother features.|$|E

50|$|Due to the machine's {{relatively}} low price, and subsequent popularity, {{all of the}} Solidoodle printers to date have enjoyed an active modding community, with blogs like Solidoodle Tips leading the way. Solidoodle modifications typically strive to enhance the functionality of the printer {{in order to achieve}} the performance of more expensive printers, taking advantage of the machine's relatively sturdy steel gantry system. Common modifications include hot-end and extruder replacements, improved carriage systems, bowden style extrusion systems, <b>build</b> <b>plate</b> replacements, and thread ball screws. Installing a cooling fan at the point of extrusion is a popular modification. This drastically improves the accuracy of prints by allowing the contours to cool rapidly and evenly. This minimises any distortion created by forms that cool unevenly and may buckle during printing. This buckling is persistent in forms like bowls, where the cantilever edge of each layer cools faster than the inside edge of the layer which is kept warmer by its contact with the previous layer. The uneven cooling sees the outside edges shrink inwards and up. As more layers of the print proceed, the extruder can be seen to be pushing the print around with each new layer as the problem of contours leaning inwards and upwards multiplies the distortion. The use of a fan however reduces the binding of the layers with less merging of the surfaces.|$|E
