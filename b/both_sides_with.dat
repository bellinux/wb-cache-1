5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the siege, the retreating remains of the Arab fleet were decimated in a storm, and Byzantine forces launched a counter-offensive, with a fleet sacking Laodicea and an army driving the Arabs from Asia Minor. For the next three decades, naval warfare featured constant raids from <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>with</b> the Byzantines launching repeated attacks against the Muslim naval bases in Syria (Laodicea), and Egypt (Damietta and Tinnis). In 727, a revolt of the thematic fleets, largely motivated by resentment against the Emperor's iconoclasm, was put down by the imperial fleet through use of Greek fire. Despite the losses this entailed, some 390warships were reportedly sent to attack Damietta in 739, and in 746 the Byzantines decisively defeated the Alexandrian fleet at Keramaia in Cyprus, breaking the naval power of the Umayyad Caliphate.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{campaign}} was decided by a final major action, May 1794 saw both fleets at sea with several subordinate squadrons, both admirals conducting a complicated series of convoy, commerce raiding and fleet manoeuvre operations. Numerous merchant ships and small warships were taken or destroyed during the month-long campaign by both sides and there were also two partial fleet engagements as Howe and Villaret made first contact. Both admirals suffered from wilful disobedience {{by a number of}} their officers during the battle, as well as confusion in reading signals which caused an uneven series of melees to break out rather than the unified battleline Howe had envisaged when planning the action. Nevertheless, both commanders were highly praised on their return to their home ports and the battle was considered a success by <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>with</b> only a few dissenters amongst the naval establishments of both nations.|$|E
5|$|Both plans {{started in}} July, but by mid-September, the Battle for Guadalcanal took {{priority}} for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered {{to withdraw from the}} Port Moresby area to {{the northern part of the}} island, where they faced Australian and United States troops in the Battle of Buna-Gona. Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>with</b> heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal. By the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops. In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations. The first, an offensive into the Arakan region in late 1942, went disastrously, forcing a retreat back to India by May 1943. The second was the insertion of irregular forces behind Japanese front-lines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results.|$|E
