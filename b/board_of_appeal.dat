25|$|The {{judgment}} proposes {{several questions}} {{to be put to}} the Enlarged <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> in an effort to resolve perceived conflicts between the different decisions of the Boards of Appeal. In response to this, Alain Pompidou, then president of the European Patent Office (EPO), wrote to Lord Justice Jacob to say that while clarification of certain issues relating to excluded subject matter would be welcomed, there were currently insufficient differences between relevant <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> decisions that would justify a referral. Instead, a referral would be appropriate if the approach taken by one <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> would lead to the grant of a patent whereas the approach taken by another Board would not. On 22 October 2008, Pompidou's successor Alison Brimelow did refer a number of questions to the Enlarged Board. In its opinion G 3/08, the Enlarged Board rejected the referral as inadmissible.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} to intervene not only exists during pending opposition proceedings before an Opposition Division (i.e., {{during the first}} instance proceedings), but also during subsequent pending appeal proceedings before a <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> (i.e., during the second instance proceedings).|$|E
25|$|The same {{principles}} should constrain {{the composition of}} a <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> in opposition appeal proceedings vs. its composition in examination appeal proceedings in relation respectively to a European patent and the European patent application {{that gave rise to}} that patent.|$|E

25|$|During first {{instance}} proceedings, {{a decision on}} apportionment of costs forms part of the main decision of the Opposition Division. The main decision however only deals with the obligation on the party or parties concerned to bear costs (apportionment), whereas the actual amounts to be paid by one party to another are dealt with in another decision, namely a decision on the award (fixing) of costs. A decision on the award of costs is taken only after a decision apportioning the costs has been taken and if a request is submitted to that effect. When a <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> has to rule on an apportionment of costs, both the apportionment of costs and the fixing of costs to be apportioned are dealt with in a single decision.|$|E
500|$|If {{swimmers}} do {{not agree}} with their classifications, they can appeal through the IPC <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> on Classification, which is the body recognised by IPC Swimming. Formal processes exist for how to do this in both non-competition and competition periods. Classification assessment took roughly 30 to 45 minutes at the 1996 Summer Paralympics.

50|$|The <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> {{is totally}} {{independent}} <b>of</b> the <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Trustees. Each <b>board</b> member is appointed for a staggered five-year term, {{which can be}} renewed. The <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> primarily acts on an appeal from a disapproval of the Building Inspector, perhaps requesting a variance from the Village Code. This Board is asked to rule on difficult issues and, on occasions, does overturn a ruling <b>of</b> the <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Trustees. <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeals</b> hearing can require {{the presence of a}} court stenographer and, on many such cases, attorneys will be present.|$|R
5000|$|The Case Law <b>of</b> the <b>Boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>of</b> the European Patent Office is a book, {{published}} by the European Patent Office (EPO), which summarizes the body of case law on the European Patent Convention developed by the <b>Boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> <b>of</b> the EPO since the EPC entered into force {{at the end of}} the 1970s. Its eighth edition was published in August 2016. The book is also known as the [...] "White Book", and it is the best-selling publication of the EPO. The White Book is published every three to four years. In the meantime, a special edition of the EPO Official Journal is issued each year summarizing the most recent case law <b>of</b> the <b>boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Each {{party to}} the {{opposition}} proceedings normally bears the costs it has incurred, unless the Opposition Division (or, in appeal proceedings, the <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> under [...] ), for reasons of equity, orders a different apportionment of costs. For example, in case T 1306/05, a highly relevant document had been lately filed, without any valid justification, by the opponent during the oral proceedings before the <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal,</b> thus rendering useless both the oral proceedings and the patent proprietor preparation thereto. A different apportionment of costs has been ordered by the <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal.</b> The patent proprietor has requested, under [...] and , about €26,000 to be paid by the opponent.|$|E

2500|$|An {{opposition}} may {{be filed}} by a straw man {{to hide the}} identity of the party actually interested in having the patent revoked.

2500|$|Independently {{from the}} {{possibility}} to intervene in opposition proceedings (and then to become party to the proceedings), anyone may also file observations under [...] After publication of a European patent application, and a fortiori after grant of a European patent, anyone may file observations regarding the patentability of the invention which {{is the subject of}} the application (during examination proceedings) or patent (during opposition proceedings). In contrast to an intervener however, a person filing observations during opposition proceedings does not become party to the proceedings. This notably means that such person does not acquire the [...] "bundle of procedural rights" [...] created [...] "in respect of the opponent", such as the right to be heard before any decision is taken. Observations by third parties, which must be filed in writing, may be filed by post or online. According to <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> 3.3.08, the observations have to be signed [...] "in order to allow an identification of the third party" [...] and, unless [...] "adopted by a party to the proceedings as its own" [...] or by the competent organ of the EPO of its own motion, [...] "anonymous third party observations are to be disregarded altogether." ...|$|E
