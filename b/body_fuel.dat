25|$|The cleaved SREBP then migrates to the nucleus, {{and acts}} as a {{transcription}} factor to bind to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), which stimulates the transcription of many genes. Among these are the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and HMG-CoA reductase. The LDL receptor scavenges circulating LDL from the bloodstream, whereas HMG-CoA reductase leads to an increase of endogenous production of cholesterol. A large part of this signaling pathway was clarified by Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein in the 1970s. In 1985, they received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work. Their subsequent work shows how the SREBP pathway regulates expression of many genes that control lipid formation and metabolism and <b>body</b> <b>fuel</b> allocation.|$|E

In addition to food restriction, a ketogenic high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet that accelerates fatty acid oxidation and systemic instillation of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate were employed to elevate internal D-beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration.

40|$|The Eurasian {{woodcock}} (Scolopax rusticola) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widespread species of the Scolopax genus in temperate regions. However, population levels can be greatly affected by harsh cold spells that led woodcocks to starve by exhaustion of their <b>body</b> <b>fuels.</b> To better understand the vulnerability of woodcocks to such climatic conditions it is of a major importance to determine the amount of their body reserves (both lipids and proteins) throughout the wintering season. This was performed on 55 individuals collected by hunters in the western part of France during two consecutive winters under mild weather conditions. Body reserves, that can be mobilised, were determined as the difference between the total amount of lipids and proteins minus the values obtained on starved individuals found dead during previous cold spells. Overall, body reserves did not significantly change over both winters (p > 0. 40), the maximal mean value (1539 ± 117 kJ) being however reached in January. Storing <b>body</b> <b>fuels</b> would not adversely affect wing and power loading, suggesting that the amount of body reserves would agree with the "starvation-predation trade-off". If woodcocks sit through a cold spell, their mean survival time (or fasting endurance) would be 6. 5 ± 0. 5 days; 25 to 40 % of the birds would have a life expectancy of 7 - 9 days, and about 8 to 17 % less than 5 days. On the contrary, if woodcocks immediately leave their wintering quarter, they would be able to perform a trip of 740 ± 50 km, 20 to 40 % of the woodcocks being able to fly over 750 km. Body mass explains only 47 to 57 % of the fasting endurance and flight autonomy variations, and therefore we recommend a further carcass analysis to accurately estimate body condition. These results underscore the suitability of determining the state of body reserves for practical cases of population management and hunting policy during cold spells...|$|R

Diabetes is a problem with the <b>body's</b> <b>fuel</b> system. It is caused by lack of insulin, a hormone made in the pancreas that is essential for getting energy from food. There are two kinds of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90 % of all diabetes cases. In this research paper we examine the adults experiencing diabetes using fuzzy relational maps. We have arrived at interesting conclusions. This paper has four sections.
