5|$|Arkham Origins was {{considered}} an incremental installment for the series, rather than a transformative one. GameSpot said that Arkham City expanded on Arkham Asylum <b>by</b> <b>applying</b> <b>the</b> game mechanics to a larger open-world setting, but criticized Arkham Origins for replicating Arkham City without moving the series forward. Other critics agreed, saying that the game's well-received elements from the previous game were not significantly developed or augmented and it was routine rather than inspired. However, other reviewers rated it {{on a par with}} Arkham City.|$|E

5|$|In some cases, these {{algorithms}} can {{be extended}} to other, non-perfect, classes of graphs as well. For instance, in a circle graph, the neighborhood of each vertex is a permutation graph, so a maximum clique in a circle graph can be found <b>by</b> <b>applying</b> <b>the</b> permutation graph algorithm to each neighborhood. Similarly, in a unit disk graph (with a known geometric representation), there is a polynomial time algorithm for maximum cliques based on applying the algorithm for complements of bipartite graphs to shared neighborhoods of pairs of vertices.|$|E

During Cena's feud with Big Show, The Miz challenged {{him to a}} match on the April 27 episode of Raw, but as Cena was out due to injury, Miz claimed an unofficial win via forfeit and continued to do this over the following weeks, until Cena defeated him in a singles match at The Bash.|$|E

5|$|The fourth match (which {{received}} a pre-match endorsement from Stephanie McMahon) featured Paige retaining her NXT Women's Championship over Emma. Paige managed to prevent Emma from applying her Emma Lock submission hold during the match and also withstood several other holds applied by Emma. When Paige attempted a superplex, Emma countered with a sitout powerbomb on Paige, {{but it was}} not enough to secure a win. A frustrated Emma slapped Paige, who retaliated with her signature Paige Turner. Yet, Emma became the first person to kick out of the Paige Turner. Paige responded <b>by</b> <b>applying</b> <b>the</b> Paige Tapout submission hold, which was enough for the victory when Emma submitted. Paige embraced Emma after the match.|$|E
