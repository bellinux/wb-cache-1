25|$|Like {{many other}} Google web applications, Google Maps uses JavaScript extensively. As the user drags the map, the grid squares are {{downloaded}} from the server and {{inserted into the}} page. When a user searches for a business, the results are downloaded in the background for insertion into the side panel and map; the page is not reloaded. Locations are drawn dynamically by positioning a red pin (composed of several partially transparent PNGs) {{on top of the}} map images. A hidden IFrame with form submission is used because it preserves <b>browser</b> <b>history.</b> The site also uses JSON for data transfer rather than XML, for performance reasons. These techniques both fall under the broad Ajax umbrella. The result is termed a slippy map and is implemented elsewhere in projects such as OpenLayers.|$|E
25|$|Chromium 12.0 was {{released}} on 11 March 2011, with 12.0.700.0 as the first version. Initial changes in the first versions of Chromium 12 included about:flags updates of test features, incorporating an fps counter for hardware acceleration benchmarks, a P2P API interface that may indicate future platform data exchange features, an enhanced URL bar and small changes to the tabs. Chromium 12 incorporated WebKit 534.24 and V8 javascript engine version 3.2.1.1. It is anticipated that a URL bar web app launcher will be added during the development cycle. Chromium 12 also introduced a new simplified 2D logo that replaced the 3D style logo used from the project since its inception. Early in the Chromium 12 cycle the history quick provider was introduced. This feature automatically searches the <b>browser</b> <b>history</b> for websites visited in the past 72 hours looking for matching page titles and URLs. It also searches through URLs that have been typed {{at least twice as}} well as URLs that have been visited at least four times ever.|$|E

In the animated series South Park, the episode [...] "The End of Serialization as We Know It", Ike Broflovski's <b>browser</b> <b>history</b> indicates that he searched for the show. The twelfth episode of Yuri on Ice includes a flashback in which a young J.J. Leroy is dressed to resemble South Park Eric Cartman. Yuri on Ice is also referenced in the Steven Universe comic by Melanie Gillman and Katy Farina: in the fourth volume, Yuri K., Yuri P., Victor and minor character Otabek Altin are depicted visiting a renaissance faire in Beach City. Two cafés themed around the series have been established in Tokyo: The first was created in December 2016 in Ikebukuro, and the second was established in May 2017 in Shibuya, and is planned to run until July 2, 2017.|$|E

5000|$|In pre-HTML5 browsers, pages {{dynamically}} created using successive Ajax requests did {{not automatically}} register {{themselves with the}} <b>browser's</b> <b>history</b> engine, so clicking the browser's [...] "back" [...] button may not have returned the browser to an earlier state of the Ajax-enabled page, but may have instead returned to the last full page visited before it. Such behavior — navigating between pages instead of navigating between page states — may be desirable, but if fine-grained tracking of page state is required, then a pre-HTML5 workaround was to use invisible iframes to trigger changes in the <b>browser's</b> <b>history.</b> A workaround implemented by Ajax techniques {{is to change the}} URL fragment identifier (the part of a URL after the [...] "#") when an Ajax-enabled page is accessed and monitor it for changes. HTML5 provides an extensive API standard for working with the <b>browser's</b> <b>history</b> engine.|$|R

2500|$|Websites such as Delicious, Digg, Slashdot, Diigo, Stumbleupon, and Reddit {{are popular}} social {{bookmarking}} sites used {{in social media}} promotion.

2500|$|In November 2012, WKMG-TV {{television}} in Orlando reported that police never investigated Firefox browser evidence on Casey Anthony's computer {{the day of}} Caylee's death; they only looked at Internet Explorer evidence. The <b>browser</b> <b>history</b> showed that someone at the Anthony household, using a password-protected account Casey Anthony used, did a Firefox Google search for [...] "foolproof suffocation" [...] at 2:51p.m. and then clicked on an article criticizing pro-suicide websites promoting [...] "foolproof" [...] ways to die, including the idea of committing suicide by taking poison and putting a plastic bag over one's head. The browser then recorded activity on MySpace, a site used by Casey Anthony but not George Anthony. The station learned about this information from Casey Anthony's attorney Jose Baez who mentioned it in his book on the case, speculating that George had contemplated suicide after Caylee's death. He conceded to reporters that the records are open to interpretation; however, he speculated that the state may {{have chosen not to}} introduce the search at trial because, according to Baez, the computer records tend to refute the timeline stated by George Anthony, which was that Casey left at 12:50p.m. An analysis by John Goetz, a retired engineer and computer expert in Connecticut, revealed that her password-protected computer account shows activity on the home computer at 1:39p.m., with activity on her AIM account, as well as MySpace and Facebook.|$|E
40|$|The History {{feature of}} most browsers {{does not fully}} {{represent}} the activity of users on the web, but simply presents a list of visited sites. As a result, the full potential of the hypertext paradigm is not exploited, with the web being viewed {{as a collection of}} online static documents rather than interconnected text. Methods of re-developing the concept of the History in terms of the original hypertext paradigm should be investigated. By redefining the <b>browser's</b> <b>History</b> in hypertext terms, the web's usefulness as an information medium would be dramatically improved.

50|$|In a web browser, {{the address}} bar (also {{location}} bar or URL bar) is a graphical control element {{that shows the}} current URL. The user can type a URL into the bar to navigate to a chosen website. In a file browser it serves the same purpose of navigation but through the file-system hierarchy. Many address bars offer features like autocomplete {{and a list of}} suggestions while the address is being typed in. This auto-completion feature bases its suggestions on the <b>browser's</b> <b>history.</b> Some <b>browsers</b> have keyboard shortcuts to auto-complete an address. These are generally configured by the user on a case-by-case basis. Address bars have been a feature of web browsers since NCSA Mosaic.|$|R
