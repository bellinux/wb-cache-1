50|$|In May 2008, a {{sparkling}} shield-shaped 101.27 carat g diamond (about {{the size of}} a ping pong <b>ball)</b> <b>mined</b> from the Premier Mine sold for more than $6.2 million at Christie's in Hong Kong. Cut from a 460 carat g rough, the shield-shaped gem boasts 92 brilliant facets. While internally flawless, the stone has a slight imperfection on the surface that is imperceptible to the human eye, the auction house said. It is the largest colourless diamond to appear on the auction market in the last 18 years, Christie's said. Only three diamonds of more than 100 carat g have appeared at auction. All were sold in Geneva. Naming rights were granted to the new owner.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Milling {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} techniques in mechanical engineering and much effort has been done to optimize the comminution efficiency of milling techniques with respect to energy, space and time consumption 2. Mainly because of their simple construction and application ball milling is a wide spread milling technology, particularly in <b>mining.</b> <b>Ball</b> mills are (usually large) cylindrical devices of length and diameter up to several meters which revolve along their axis. The material to be comminuted moves inside the cylinder. There are two different methods: autogeneous comminution where the material is pure and heterogeneous comminution where the material is mixed with heavy spheres from steel of typical diameter of several centimeters to increase efficiency. Throughout the paper we will deal with autogeneous comminution. Unfortunately the efficiency of ball mills is not very high and, therefore, engineers did much scientific work to incre...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{establish}} {{evidence for the}} widespread existence of metal binding and transport by natural organic matter (NOM) in karst dripwaters, the imprint of which in speleothems may have important climatic significance. We studied the concentration of trace metals and organic carbon (OC) in sequentially filtered dripwaters and soil leachates from three contrasting sites: Poole's Cavern (Derbyshire, UK), Lower <b>Balls</b> Green <b>Mine</b> (Gloucestershire, UK) and Grotta di Ernesto (Trentino, Italy). The size-distribution of metals in the three soils was highly similar, but distinct from that found in fractionated dripwaters: surface-reactive metals were concentrated in the coarse fraction (> 100 nm) of soils, but in the fine colloidal (Ni > Co) for sites in colloidal or dissolved NOM. Large shifts in Cu:Ni in dripwaters coincided with high fluxes of particulate OC (following peak infiltration) and showed increased similarity to ratios in soils, diagnostic of qualitative changes in NOM supply (i. e. fresh inputs of more aromatic/hydrophobic soil organic matter (SOM) with Cu outcompeting Ni for suitable binding sites). Results indicate that at high-flows (i. e. where fracture-fed flow dominates) particulates and colloids migrate at similar rates, whereas, in slow seepage-flow dripwaters, particulates (> 1 μm) and small colloids (1 – 100 nm) decouple, resulting in two distinct modes of NOM–metal transport: high-flux and low-flux. At the hyperalkaline drip site PE 1 (in Poole's Cavern), high-fluxes of metals (Cu, Ni, Zn, Ti, Mn, Fe) and particulate NOM occurred in rapid, short-lived pulses following peak infiltration events, whereas low-fluxes of metals (Co and V > Cu, Ni and Ti) and fluorescent NOM (< ca. 100 nm) were offset from infiltration events, probably because small organic colloids (1 – 100 nm) and solutes (< 1 nm) were slower to migate through the porous matrix than particulates. These results demonstrate the widespread occurrence of both colloidal and particulate NOM–metal transport in cave dripwaters {{and the importance of}} karst hydrology in affecting the breakthrough times of different species. Constraints imposed by soil processes (colloid/particle release), direct contributions of metals and NOM from rainfall, and flow-routing (colloid/particle migration) are expected to determine the strength of correlations between NOM-transported metals in speleothems and climatic signals. Changes in trace metal ratios (e. g. Cu:Ni) in speleothems may encode information on NOM composition, potentially aiding in targeting of compound-specific investigations and for the assessment of changes in the quality of soil organic matter...|$|R
6000|$|History is full, {{down to this}} day, of the imbecility {{of kings}} and governors. They are a class of persons much to be pitied, for they know not what they should do. The weavers strike for bread; and the king and his ministers, {{not knowing what to}} do, meet them with bayonets. But Napoleon {{understood}} his business. Here was a man who, in each moment and emergency, knew what to do next. It is an immense comfort and refreshment to the spirits, not only of kings, but of citizens. Few men have any next; they live from hand to mouth, without plan, and are ever {{at the end of their}} line, and, after each action, wait for an impulse from abroad. Napoleon had been the first man of the world if his ends had been purely public. As he is, he inspires confidence and vigor by the extraordinary unity of his action. He is firm, sure, self-denying, self-postponing, sacrificing everything to his aim,--money, troops, generals, and his own safety also, to his aim; not misled, like common adventurers, by the splendor of his own means. [...] "Incidents ought not to govern policy," [...] he said, [...] "but policy, incidents." [...] "To be hurried away by every event, is to have no political system at all. His victories were only so many doors, and he never for a moment lost sight of his way onward, in the dazzle and uproar of the present circumstance. He knew what to do, and he flew to his mark. He would shorten a straight line to come at his object. Horrible anecdotes may, no doubt, be collected from his history, of the price at which he bought his successes; but he must not therefore be set down as cruel; but only as one who knew no impediment to his will; not bloodthirsty, not cruel,--but woe to what thing or person stood in his way! Not bloodthirsty, but not sparing of blood,--and pitiless. He saw only the object: the obstacle must give way.

'You are losing time,' he cried; 'fire upon those masses; they must be engulfed; fire upon the ice!' The order remained unexecuted for ten minutes.

My method was immediately followed by the adjoining batteries, and in less than no time we buried 'some' [Footnote: As I quote at second-hand, and cannot procure Seruzier, I dare not adopt the high figure I find.] thousands of Russians and Austrians under the waters of the lake." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{disposal}} of large Off-the-Road (OTR) tires is {{an increasingly important}} concern. These tires can weigh up to 8, 450 pounds with an overall diameter and width of approximately 140. 7 inches and 45. 1 inches respectively. OTR tires are used for mining vehicles such as haul trucks, wheel loaders, backhoes, graders, and trenchers. [1] These new tires cost between $ 38, 000 and $ 50, 000 each, depending on multiple factors including oil prices and the cyclical nature of the industry. Haul trucks contain six tires per vehicle, and mines replace these tires around every 9 - 12 months. [2] Statistics regarding discarded OTR tires are not provided by the industry as they are for other types of tires. Thus, {{it is difficult to}} approximate the number and location of waste OTR tires not only in individual states, but in the U. S. in general. [3] Currently, Minnesota and Arizona are the only states that place regulations and fees on OTR tires. However, Minnesota is the only state that actually tracks them. [3] The Rubber Manufacturers Association (RMA) roughly estimates that OTR tires account for 1 % of scrap tires by number and 15 % by weight. When the tires are replaced, the old tires can be discarded with the waste rock in stockpiles at the mining site but more often are landfilled without documentation by an appropriate agency due to lack of federal regulations. Their low density and hollow centers cause them to float to the top of landfills, disrupting the compactness. [4] Also, tires have a heat content 20 - 40 % greater than that of coal which can be very dangerous on the rare occasions that tires catch fire in stockpiles. [5] Furthermore, burning tires release hazardous substances including pyrolytic oil, ash, and smoke, which contain carcinogens, heavy metals, and other toxic compounds. [6] Due to the large size of OTR tires, there are few facilities that can accommodate their recycling. [3] This leads to increased costs in transporting them to such sites. Transportation costs for a tire taken out of service can be up to $ 1000. In addition to the freight costs, recycling an OTR tire can cost up to $ 1500 because of their rugged construction compared to passenger tires which cost around $ 1 to recycle. [3] In response to the waste OTR tire problem, the Ball Hogs from the University of Arkansas have designed a solution that recycles OTR tires by using old tires as liners in ball mills for hard rock <b>mines.</b> <b>Ball</b> mills are large cylindrical vessels consisting of an outer shell, an inside liner and a load of metal balls. A motor turns the ball mill using a transmission system causing the metal balls to move in a cascading motion to grind the material fed into the ball mill. Ball mills require liners that are constructed from materials such as steel or rubber. For a 30 ft long ball mill with a Task # 2 5 University of Arkansas 20 ft diameter, a hard rubber liner reinforced with steel can cost $ 150, 000. These liners are replaced at least once a year, creating a substantial upkeep cost for these <b>ball</b> mills. Metal <b>mines</b> in Bolivia are already using tractor tires to line many ball mills. This technique has been effective for over twenty years. The high import costs of new liners and the low cost of labor has led many Bolivian metal processors to use truck and tractor tires as liners in their ball mills. This construction normally occurs on site using tools like handsaws, drills, torches and knives to cut up tires and manpower to mount these tire-made liners onto mills. However, this is not always the case in the U. S. where labor costs are much higher and the mills are generally larger. Many mines in the U. S. do not have the means to fabricate and install these liners on site; therefore, a third-party solution is proposed that will take a mine’s discarded tires and make ball mill liners out of them. The Ball Hogs’ solution provides an environmentally and economically feasible process of increasing the life of OTR tires beyond their typical use. This alternative would utilize the engineering and technology that makes these tires strong enough to hold a 400 ton truck. Mining companies would save yearly an average of $ 70, 000 per ball mill liner replacement, and over 780, 000 kg of CO 2 per liner. Furthermore, mining companies would earn positive PR, goodwill, and tax breaks. We recommend all mining companies use their OTR tire treads as ball mill liners...|$|R
