40|$|Cracks are {{frequently}} formed in α-alumina supported MFI membranes during calcination. To better understand crack formation, in situ powder diffraction {{data were collected}} during calcination of a type of MFI membrane (ca. 1800 nm thick) which is known to crack reproducibly. In addition, data for MFI powder and a <b>blank</b> <b>support</b> were also collected. Both a synchrotron radiation facility and an in-house instrument were used. The unit cell parameters were determined with the Rietveld method, and the strain in the direction perpendicular to the film surface was calculated for the film {{as well as for}} the support. The microstrain in the support was also estimated. Based on the results obtained here, a model for crack formation in this type of MFI membrane was proposed. The lack of cracks in other types of MFI membranes (ca. 500 nm) prepared in our laboratory is also explained by the model. In thicker MFI films, the crystals are well intergrown. During heating, the MFI crystals contract and the α-alumina support expands. Consequently, a thermal stress develops in the composite which eventually leads to formation of cracks in the film and structural defects in the support. In thinner films, the crystals are less well intergrown and the thermal expansion mismatch leads to opening of grain boundaries rather than cracks...|$|E
40|$|Selective {{removal of}} water from the Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) during {{reaction}} may allow the use of a cobalt catalyst with crystal size < 6 nm hence increasing the catalyst activity. Zeolite membranes are a potential route to in-situ water removal due to their chemical and thermal stability under FTS reaction conditions. Zeolite membranes with a low Si/ Al ratio are hydrophilic. It has been hypothesised that reducing the Si/ Al ratio will result in increased water selectivity and permeance. It is also hypothesised that the separation process can be modelled using the MaxwellStefan (MS) formulation. MFI zeolite membranes were synthesised on a-alumina supports, of varying Si/ Al ratio. Two synthesis techniques were used: viz. with and without the assistance of structure directing agents. The membrane physical properties were characterised by SEM and XRD. Membrane quality was evaluated using n-hexane porosimetry. Single gas and mixture separations were carried out. A trans-membrane pressure gradient was applied in single gas measurements. Binary and ternary mixture separations were carried out using a model reaction mixture that approximates FTS conditions. This mixture was fed to a Wicke-Kallenbach cell. The total pressure {{on both sides of the}} membrane was equal, with a sweep gas applied to remove the permeate. Single gas permeation measurements on a <b>blank</b> <b>support</b> shows that viscous and knudsen flow are the dominant transport mechanisms in the support. A single gas permeation model for the zeolite membranes show that viscous and knudsen flow still dominate in pure component measurements. This due to the high flux through the zeolite films. During mixture separations viscous and knudsen flow are negligible as there is no pressure gradient. Comparing pure component and binary mixture separations the flux of hydrogen decreases by more than two orders of magnitude for the binary case. In the binary system water adsorption results in blockage of pores hence hydrogen permeance is reduced. Binary H 20 /H 2 separation selectivity increases with decreasing Si/ Al ratio. Increasing temperature results in a decrease in this selectivity. Water adsorption decreases with increasing temperature hence hydrogen can permeate faster. With the addition of n-hexane as a third component, permeance of water and hydrogen decrease, however ternary H 20 /H 2 separation selectivity increases. The Maxwell-Stefan model developed does not predict binary hydrogen permeation well. Permeance is much higher than predicted by the model possibly due to defects. Ternary hydrogen permeance is however more accurately predicted. Water and n-hexane permeances are predicted well by the model...|$|E

The tests were performed with a simulated gas mixture containing NO, SO 2, O- 2, H 2 O and N- 2 or a real flue gas produced on line. The results showed that the coated honeycomb catalyst has an extraordinary high activity for low-temperature deNO(x) in the presence of 5 vol. % steam and 1000 ppm SO 2. Its activity increased with increasing the coating thickness and reached at 110 mu m thickness as comparable as that of the 100 % active components-molded catalyst, suggesting the deNO(x) reaction proceeded mainly in the surface layers of the honeycomb cell wall and hence coated honeycomb catalyst should be more cost-efficient than 100 % active components-molded one. In a real coal-burned flue gas stream the catalyst maintained essentially its low temperature activity and stability, further verifying its high industrial applicability. Then, the effects of NO concentration and NH 3 /NO ratio on NO conversion were investigated to seek a suitable kinetic model for prediction of the catalyst's deNO(x) rate and reactor design for pilot plant research. The data obtained showed that a simple power-law kinetic equation with first order in NO and zero order in ammonia {{can be applied to the}} coated honeycomb catalyst, and was used for determination of the kinetic parameters.

The harshest requirements for this contract are surviving and functioning, to within 20 ppm of its center frequency, 30 ms after sustaining a shock pulse of 100, 000 (g) for 0. 5 ms on any axis. Additional requirements call for the transmitter to be no larger than 0. 2 in 3, and to operate within a 20 ppm frequency stability throughout the temperature range of - 400 to + 850 centigrade and during centrifugal spins of up to 300 Hz or 25, 000 (g).

40|$|In this work, a seeding {{technique}} {{was used to}} synthesize films and membranes of FAU, LTA and MFI type zeolites. In the first part, hydrothermal growth was performed without organic template molecules, which resulted in template-free zeolite films and membranes. The samples were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-ray Powder Diffraction and permeation measurements with gaseous probe molecules. Thin films of FAU-type zeolite were prepared on polished single crystals. The thickness and morphology of the films could be controlled by varying the synthesis conditions. Preparation of LTA-type membranes was also attempted. However, the membranes cracked during drying at temperatures above room temperature. Template free MFI membranes with higher quality could be prepared. These membranes had a maximum separation factor alpha of 17. 8 at 220 °C for a n-butane/i-butane mixture. Cracks formed at temperatures higher than 250 °C. Crack formation in zeolite membranes at high temperatures has also been reported by several other groups. Since no model for the crack formation process {{has been established in}} the literature, the second part of this work was devoted to study crack formation and to develop a model. Relatively thick (ca 1800 nm) alpha-alumina supported MFI films, prepared using organic template molecules (TPA+), were selected for the study since data on crack formation in the form of SEM images and permeation measurements for these membranes had been obtained in earlier work by the group. These membranes were further studied by in-situ High Temperature X-ray Powder Diffraction experiments in the present work. In addition, MFI powder and a <b>blank</b> alpha-alumina <b>support</b> were also investigated. Data were collected {{with the aid of a}} Synchrotron radiation facility as well as with a conventional laboratory instrument for the temperature cycle 25 - 500 - 25 °C. The Rietveld method was used to determine the unit cell parameters of MFI and alpha-alumina as well as the TPA+ occupancy of MFI. The out-of- plane strain (i. e. strain in the direction perpendicular to the film surface) in the film and the support was calculated. In addition, the microstructure of the support was investigated by pattern decomposition and Williamson-Hall plots. In agreement with previous reports in the literature, it was found that the TPA-MFI structure contracts as a consequence of template removal and possibly also a structure intrinsic mechanism and the alpha-alumina support expands. Hence, a large thermal expansion mismatch occurs in the membranes during heating. An overall out- of-plane compressive strain was observed for the MFI film during heating, which indicates an in-plane tensile stress (i. e. in the direction parallel to the film surface) in the film. This result was explained by the larger expansion of the support, compared to the film. The alpha-alumina support was also found to be under an overall out-of-plane compressive strain at non-ambient temperatures, presumably due to zeolite in the pores of the support. The microstrain for the MFI coated alpha-alumina support increased during heating, and remained during cooling, which indicate the formation of structural defects in the support. Based on these results and results from earlier work, a model for crack formation was proposed: In the thick films (ca 1800 nm) studied in the present work, the crystals are well intergrown. During heating, the MFI crystals contracts and the alpha- alumina support expands. Consequently, a thermal stress develops in the composite which eventually leads to formation of cracks. In addition, part of the stress is also released via formation of structural defects in the alpha-alumina support. In thinner films (ca 500 nm), the crystals are less well intergrown and the thermal expansion mismatch between the crystals in the film and the support leads to opening of grain boundaries in the film rather than cracks.

Josep Arus, Nik Bates-Haus, Andrew Dalke, 'DoliathGavid', 'elcaceres', Peter Gedeck, James Jeffryes, Brian Kelley, Juuso Lehtivarjo, Rich Lewis, Daniel Lowe, 'maddogcz', Kozo Nishida, Michal Nowotka, Axel Pahl, Steven Roughley, Alexander Savelyev, Nadine Schneider, Gianluca Sforna, Teague Sterling, Nik Stiefl, Matt Swain, Eric Ting, Paolo Tosco, Samo Turk, Riccardo Vianello Highlights: Improvements to the build system: it's now much easier to build with InChI and/or Avalon support since cmake now knows how to fetch the appropriate source code for you. Building the PostgreSQL cartridge is now integrated into normal build process. Some improvements to molecule rendering and Jupyter notebook integration: The new Draw. PrepareMolForDrawing() function takes care of standard tasks like wedging bonds, kekulization, and adding chiral Hs. Draw. MolsToGridImage() can generate SVGs and uses the new molecular drawing code for PNGs when possible. The Jupyter notebook integration uses the new drawing code when possible.
