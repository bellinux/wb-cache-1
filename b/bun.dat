5|$|In April 2011, Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay {{was elected}} as the party's president, {{replacing}} Keo Puth Rasmey {{who in turn}} was appointed the party's chairperson. Thirteen months later, Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay and Ranariddh signed an agreement to merge NRP into FUNCINPEC, which provided for Ranariddh to become FUNCINPEC's president with Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay as his deputy. The agreement was brokered by Hun Sen, who wanted both parties to reunite. However, the merger agreement fell apart, as Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay and Ranariddh accused each other of harbouring thoughts of supporting other opposition parties. Subsequently, in March 2013, Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay was succeeded by Norodom Arunrasmy as the party's president, who in turn resumed his former role as the party's secretary-general. When general elections were held in July 2013, FUNCINPEC suffered defeat as it lost its remaining two seats which it held in the National Assembly. In turn, Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay relinquished his Deputy Prime Minister position and was made a government adviser, although the CPP-led government appointed 28 FUNCINPEC members as undersecretaries of state.|$|E

5|$|In July 2015, FUNCINPEC {{announced}} {{the formation of}} the Cambodian Royalist Youth Movement, a youth organisation aimed at garnering electoral support for the party from younger voters. Meanwhile, tension persisted between Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay and Ranariddh, which erupted into a public spat, as Ranariddh threatened to expelled Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay who in turn, accused the party president of holding a grudge against him. Subsequently, on 3 February 2016, Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay announced that he was quitting the party, and went on to form his new party, the Khmer National United Party (KNUP). The KNUP adopted a logo which was similar to a former logo of FUNCINPEC, featuring the Cambodian Independence Monument. The secretary-general, Say Hak accepted Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay's resignation, {{while at the same time}} challenged KNUP's use of its new logo as he lodged a successful complaint with the interior ministry.|$|E

5|$|In May 2006, an {{anonymous}} {{letter from the}} Ministry of Information was circulated within the party, stating Ranariddh's purported intention {{to form a new}} royalist party. Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay followed the issue closely and provided a list of party members who were planning to defect from Funcinpec, which included Serey Kosal and Chakrapong. At the same time, Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay appointed Nouv Sovathero party spokesman, while re-designating the then-incumbent party spokesman Chea Chanboribo the personal spokesman for Ranariddh. The cascade of incidents from Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay stoked anger from Serey Kosal and Chakrapong who threatened to sue him. When Ranariddh was fired from his position as the president of Funcinpec in October 2006, Chakrapong was also expelled from the party and senate the following month.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, Ranariddh {{received}} a royal pardon from Sihamoni (who had succeeded {{to the throne}} in October 2004) for his embezzlement conviction, allowing {{him to return to}} Cambodia without risking imprisonment. Following his return, Ranariddh announced his retirement from politics and pledged to support the CPP-led government. After his retirement, Ranariddh dedicated most of his time to philanthropic work and supporting royal activities. In late 2010, NRP and FUNCINPEC leaders including Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay publicly called for Ranariddh to return to politics. Ranariddh initially resisted the calls, but changed his mind and announced his return in December 2010. For the next one-and-a-half years, Ranariddh and Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay negotiated for a merger between NRP and FUNCINPEC. An agreement was formalised in May 2012, whereby Ranariddh would be made the president of FUNCINPEC, while Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay would become its vice-president. The merger agreement was rescinded a month later, when Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay accused Ranariddh of supporting other opposition parties. Two months later, Ranariddh declared his retirement from politics for a second time, and tendered his resignation as the president of NRP.|$|E
5|$|In early January 2015, Ranariddh {{expressed}} his intent {{to return to}} FUNCINPEC. At the party congress held on 19 January 2015, Ranariddh was reappointed as FUNCINPEC president, succeeding Arunrasmy who was appointed as its first vice-president, while Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay was appointed as second vice-president. However, rifts between Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay and Ranariddh quickly surfaced as {{the both of them}} sparred with each other over the right to use the party stamp and the appointment of Say Hak as the party's secretary general. Ranariddh eventually gained the upper hand, and Say Hak's appointment was reaffirmed at another party congress held in March 2015. He also managed to convince party delegates present at the congress to adopt a new party logo. At the same time, Ranariddh appointed four more vice-presidents to the party's executive committee, namely You Hockry, Por <b>Bun</b> Sreu, Nuth Sokhom and Nhep <b>Bun</b> Chin.|$|E

5|$|In {{subsequent}} {{days after}} the clashes, pro-CPP troops continued their military offensives against pro-FUNCINPEC troops in the northwestern parts of Cambodia, which controlled the towns of Sisophon, Banteay Meanchey and Poipet. The pro-FUNCINPEC troops, who were outmatched against their pro-CPP counterparts, retreated to O Smach in Oddar Meanchey Province, where they held out against pro-CPP troops which continued military offensives against them. At O Smach, pro-FUNCINPEC forces met the Khmer Rouge forces led by Khieu Samphan, who proclaimed Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay as the chief-of-staff of the resistance forces. Fighting continued between pro-CPP and pro-FUNCINPEC troops until February 1998, when both sides agreed to a ceasefire brokered by the Japanese government. After general elections were held in July 1998, Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay called for the 20,000 pro-FUNCINPEC forces to be reintegrated into the RCAF.

5|$|Initially the {{sandwich}} {{was made with}} a plain bun; however, that changed when the company switched to a sesame-seeded <b>bun</b> around 1970.

This was part of a program to improve the product and featured a US$30 million (approx US$66 million in 2014) advertising campaign featuring various celebrities such as Mr. T and Loretta Swit. The goal of the program was to help differentiate the company and its products from those of its competitors. The Whopper reverted to its previous size in 1987 when a new management team took over the company and reverted many of the changes initiated prior to 1985. The Whopper sandwich's Kaiser roll was changed back into a sesame seed <b>bun</b> in 1994, eliminating the last trace of {{the sandwich}}'s 1985 reconfiguration.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November 2006, Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay filed {{a lawsuit}} accusing Ranariddh of {{pocketing}} $3.6 million {{from the sale of}} its headquarters to the French embassy in 2005.

Subsequently, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court ruled in Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay's favour, ruling Ranariddh guilty and sentencing the latter to 18 months of imprisonment. In October 2007, FUNCINPEC endorsed Norodom Arunrasmy, the wife of Keo Puth Rasmey, as the party's candidate for the post of Prime Minister in the general elections slated to be held in 2008. At the same time, Nhek <b>Bun</b> Chhay mooted the possibility of getting back Ranariddh into FUNCINPEC, fearing that the party might have lost its popularity following Ranariddh's ouster.|$|E
