40|$|Although {{previous}} research has examined the social interactions between online travel community users, they did not adequately show the process and pattern of online interactions <b>between</b> <b>locals</b> and tourists due to methodology limitations. Accordingly, this study examined how friendships <b>between</b> <b>locals</b> and travelers are made through online travel communities, and also investigated {{the role of an}} offline meeting in building online friendships. Data were collected from CouchSurfing. com, a hospitality exchange network. Consequently, Social Network Analysis (SNA) revealed that locals and tourists build friendships in an online community through offline events. Thus, {{it can be argued that}} the online friendships <b>between</b> <b>locals</b> and tourists in an online community are likely to be formed after a face-to-face meeting, not only by online interactions. Thus, by using the nature of online friendships, an online travel community can design a consumer-centric website...|$|R

5|$|Some of {{the militias}} that were then {{competing}} for power interpreted the UN troops' presence {{as a threat}} to their hegemony. Consequently, several gun battles took place in Mogadishu <b>between</b> <b>local</b> gunmen and peacekeepers.

The UN soldiers eventually withdrew altogether from the country on 3 March 1995, having incurred more significant casualties.|$|E

5|$|A clash <b>between</b> <b>local</b> Torajan {{leaders and}} the South Sulawesi provincial {{government}} (as a tourist developer) broke out in 1985. The government designated 18 Toraja villages and burial sites as traditional tourist attractions. Consequently, zoning restrictions were applied to these areas, such that Torajans themselves were barred from changing their tongkonans and burial sites. The plan was opposed by some Torajan leaders, as they felt that their rituals and traditions were being determined by outsiders. As a result, in 1987, the Torajan village of Kété Kesú and several other designated tourist attractions closed their doors to tourists. This closure lasted only a few days, as the villagers found it too difficult to survive without the income from selling souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{set out a}} {{detailed}} study of common descent with modifications by expanding {{on the theme of}} coevolution <b>between</b> <b>local</b> populations of insects and flowering plants that he had briefly discussed in On the Origin of Species. He examined numerous ways in which orchids vary, showing how they had diverged and developed specialised pollen-dispersal mechanisms. The intricate morphology and anatomy of each flower was carefully described. Apparently trivial details were examined in relation to natural selection to demonstrate how slight variations in similar structures of closely related flowers led to specialised modifications that provided various pollinators (insects) with different ways to cross-fertilise. The mass of descriptive detail was a great achievement, but the result is demanding to read.|$|E
5|$|Dissenting {{religious}} practitioners also widely {{resented the}} treatment {{they received from}} the Lutheran State Church through the Conventicle Act. Conflicts <b>between</b> <b>local</b> worshipers and the new churches were most explosive in the countryside, where dissenting pietist groups were more active, and were more directly under the eye of local law enforcement and the parish priest. Before non-Lutheran churches were granted toleration in 1809, clampdowns on illegal forms of worship and teaching often provoked whole groups of pietists to leave together, intent on forming their own spiritual communities in the new land. The largest contingent of such dissenters, 1,500 followers of Eric Jansson, left in the late 1840s and founded a community in Bishop Hill, Illinois.|$|E

40|$|In the Chinese cities, {{migrants}} {{have been}} treated differently from urban locals in varied aspects because of their rural or non-local hukou (household registration) status. But the existing literature provides little understanding on how migrant workers 2 ̆ 7 welfare entitlements and benefits are affected by discrimination and institution in the urban labour market. On {{the basis of an}} extended analytical framework that examines not only the segregation <b>between</b> urban <b>locals</b> and rural migrants but also the segregation <b>between</b> <b>locals</b> and non-locals, this paper investigates the discrimination against migrant workers in employment-based benefits in four megacities. The results show that there are gradient differences in access to overall and individual items of benefits among urban locals, urban migrants, and rural migrants. More than half of the benefit disparities <b>between</b> urban <b>locals</b> and migrant workers are caused by discrimination against the latter, implying that the hukou system still plays a role in segmenting China 2 ̆ 7 s urban labour market. Urban migrants and rural migrants suffer similar extent of discrimination when they are compared with urban locals, suggesting that urban labour market segmentation is currently dominated by the segregation <b>between</b> <b>locals</b> and non-locals rather than by the segregation <b>between</b> urban <b>locals</b> and rural migrants that was observed in the earlier stage of reforms. In addition, this study suggests that previous studies focusing on the mean wage may have underestimated the extent of discrimination against migrants...|$|R
5|$|Division of Sector West into Croatian- and RSK-controlled areas {{fragmented}} {{the market}} for locally grown agricultural produce, and produce processing plants were rendered inaccessible to most farmers. Furthermore, the RSK-controlled area of Sector West suffered from severe shortage of fuel and electricity, while the Croatian-held Pakrac was cut off from water supply systems fed by springs in the RSK-held area {{to the south of}} the town. The situation led the head of the UN Civil Affairs in Sector West, Gerard Fischer, and Argentine General Carlos Maria Zabala, commanding officer of the UNPROFOR in Sector West, to propose a degree of cooperation <b>between</b> <b>local</b> authorities on both sides in the area.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his victory}} in Keserwan, Shahin and his fighters {{launched}} intermittent raids against villages in nearby regions, such as Jubail and Matn, {{often in the}} name of defending the rights of local Christians. The assaults and their repercussions served as catalysts of the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war, particularly the battle of Beit Mery <b>between</b> <b>local</b> Maronites and Druze, in which Shahin was a principal belligerent. Although he claimed he could raise an army of 50,000 to combat the forces of the Druze feudal lords, he did not participate further in the war. Following the war's end, he was defeated by Youssef Karam in a struggle over political influence in Maronite affairs. Shahin subsequently relinquished his republic and worked in the judiciary of his home village, Rayfoun.|$|E
5|$|For {{lines with}} three or four tracks with express service, local stops will have side {{platforms}} and the middle one or two tracks will not stop at the station. On these lines, express stations typically have two island platforms, one for the local and express in one direction, and another for the local and express in the other direction. Each island platform provides a cross-platform interchange <b>between</b> <b>local</b> and express services. Some lines with four-track express service have two tracks each on two levels and use both island and side platforms.|$|E

5|$|Historians have {{interpreted}} the widespread presence of castles across Europe in the 11thand 12thcenturies {{as evidence that}} warfare was common, and usually <b>between</b> <b>local</b> lords. Castles were introduced into England shortly before the Norman Conquest in 1066. Before the 12thcentury, castles were as uncommon in Denmark {{as they had been}} in England before the Norman Conquest. The introduction of castles to Denmark was a reaction to attacks from Wendish pirates, and they were usually intended as coastal defences. The motte and bailey remained the dominant form of castle in England, Wales, and Ireland well into the 12thcentury. At the same time, castle architecture in mainland Europe became more sophisticated.|$|E

During Bellomont's brief visit to New Hampshire in July and August 1699, Allen attempted to buy him to his side. Allen offered his daughter (with a large dowry) as a marriage match for the earl's son; Bellomont refused the offer.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{architecture}} {{is a combination}} <b>between</b> <b>local</b> and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. Sliding doors (fusuma) were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design, and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology.|$|E
