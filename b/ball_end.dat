Soviet electronics were still fairly primitive during this period and the trials of the light cruiser Sverdlov, which carried many of these systems, revealed that the effective range of the Rif-A surface-search radar was {{less than that of}} the Yakor and Zalp fire-control radars. There were also problems transferring data from the Giuis-2 air-search radar to the Yakor and Fut-B anti-aircraft fire-control radars, which was a serious problem when dealing with high-speed aircraft. The Giuis-2 also interfered with ultra-shortwave radio reception.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} grooves, slots, and pockets in the {{work-piece}} may be produced {{from a variety}} of tool bits. Common tool bit types are: square end cutters, <b>ball</b> <b>end</b> cutters, t-slot cutters, and shell mills. Square end cutters can mill square slots, pockets, and edges. <b>Ball</b> <b>end</b> cutters mill radiused slots or fillets. T-slot cutters mill exactly that: T-shaped slots. Shell end cutters are used for large flat surfaces and for angle cuts. There are variations of these tool types as well.|$|E

The aim was to determine and compare the wear (tool life) of <b>ball</b> nose <b>end</b> mill for different types of copy milling operations, {{as well as to}} specify particular steps of the measurement process. In addition, we examined and observed cutter contact areas of <b>ball</b> nose <b>end</b> mill with machined material. For tool life test, DMG DMU 85 monoBLOCK 5 -axis CNC milling machine was used. In the experiment, cutting speed, feed rate, axial depth of cut and radial depth of cut were not changed. The cutting tool wear was measured on Zoller Genius 3 s universal measuring machine. The results show different tool life of <b>ball</b> nose <b>end</b> mills depending on the copy milling strategy...|$|R

50|$|The face {{of woods}} is {{slightly}} bulged {{to counteract the}} gear effect when the ball hits the face off center. The gear effect causes the ball to spin from hits that are away {{from the center of}} the face. The spin contributes a tendency for the ball to have a curved flight path away from the target. The slight bulge of the wood club face tends to counteract the gear effect by slightly changing the direction of the ball to make the flight path of the <b>ball</b> <b>end</b> up closer to the target.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008 Steinberger {{introduced}} {{the third generation}} TransTrem (TT3) on the new Steinberger ZT3 guitar. It maintains the ability to tranpose all string in tune and lock in three other positions, while making setup and string changes easier. The new headpiece on this guitar also allows the use of single <b>ball</b> <b>end</b> strings. Lastly it moves the bridge mounted string tuners from a horizontal to a more upright position. This allows for a greater range of installations and/or body styles, as the tuner [...] "cut out" [...] on {{the tail end of}} the body is no longer necessary.|$|E

NCXXXX is also used for Squier Strat Bullets of the same vintage. The Affinities are practically {{the same as the}} Japanese-made Squier Bullets of the mid-1980s; the same alder bodies, same rosewood-type fretboard and maple necks. Tuners and electronics are also very similar. Common modifications are more stable tuners, larger potentiometers, better capacitors, and pickups. They had single-ply 8-hole pickguards like the 1950s Fender Strats giving them a classic look. Colors were typically black, white and red.|$|E

50|$|Ibanez {{have their}} own range of double-locking vibrato systems on their range of guitars. The Edge III tremolo, {{featured}} on their low-mid range guitars, is a very similar bridge to a Floyd Rose. It features a pop in/out arm and lower profile tuners. Another system is the Edge Zero, which has what Ibanez calls the Zero Point System. This system allows the guitar's floating state to be partially locked off for tuning purposes. There is also the Edge Pro tremolo with a very low profile. Possibly its most notable feature {{is that it is}} designed to take strings without the removal of the <b>ball</b> <b>end</b> (or stringing backwards with the ball ends at the headstock). The Edge Pro also comes in a version called the Double Edge Pro, which has piezoelectric pickups for acoustic sound.|$|E
5000|$|A {{report by}} World Health Organization in 1978 {{led to the}} {{creation}} of the Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs (CPITN) and a periodontal probe termed WHO 621 ("Trintity"). It has a <b>ball</b> <b>end</b> of diameter 0.5 mm and a first colored band at 3.5 - 5.5 mm. Another colored band at 8.5 - 11.5 mm may be present. The CPITN was intended to provide a global standard for clinical practise and research, but several different periodontal screening tools were adapted from it. The Periodontal Screening and Recording (PSR) is increasingly used in the United States, Canada and Brazil. The Basic Periodontal Examination (BPE) is extensively used in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. The Primary Essential Periodontal Examination (PEPE) is used in Australia. All these methods use the WHO 621 probe.|$|E
50|$|The main air-search radar was the Giuis-2 (NATO {{designation}} Cross Bird), a Soviet {{development of}} the wartime British Type 291 radar.

50|$|On 11 October, Neville was {{involved}} in a game-changing incident during a Euro 2008 qualifier against Croatia when his straightforward backpass took an unfortunate bounce and caused goalkeeper Paul Robinson to miss his kick, which resulted in the <b>ball</b> <b>ending</b> up in the net. Although Robinson was at the centre of the moment, Neville was officially credited with an own goal, the second of his England career; he has scored no goals for England.|$|R
50|$|The end of {{the string}} that mounts to the instrument's tuning {{mechanism}} (the part of the instrument which can be turned to tighten or loosen the tension of the string) is usually plain. Depending on the instrument, the string's other, fixed end may have either a plain, loop, or <b>ball</b> <b>end</b> (a short brass cylinder) that attaches the string at the end opposite the tuning mechanism. When a ball or loop is used with a guitar, this ensures that the string stays fixed in {{the bridge of the}} guitar. When a ball or loop is used with a violin-family instrument, this keeps the string end fixed in the tailpiece. Fender Bullet strings have a larger cylinder for more stable tuning on guitars equipped with synchronized tremolo systems. Strings for some instruments may be wrapped with silk at the ends to protect the string. The color and pattern of the silk often identifies attributes of the string, such as manufacturer, size, intended pitch, etc.|$|E
5000|$|The tops of most {{steel string}} {{acoustic}} guitars are braced using the X-brace system, or {{a variation of}} the X-brace system, generally attributed to Christian Frederick Martin between 1840 and 1845 for use in gut string guitars.The system consists of two braces forming an [...] "X" [...] shape across the soundboard below the top of the sound hole. The lower arms of the [...] "X" [...] straddle and support the ends of the bridge. Under the bridge is a hardwood bridge plate which prevents the <b>ball</b> <b>end</b> of the strings from damaging the underside of the soundboard. Below the bridge patch are one or more tone bars which support the bottom of the soundboard. These abut one of the X braces and usually slant down towards the bottom edge of the soundboard. The top tone bar butts against a portion of the bridge patch in most instruments. Above the sound hole a large transverse brace spans the width of the upper bout of the soundboard. Around the lower bout, small finger braces support the area between the X-braces and the edge of the soundboard.|$|E
50|$|The {{first period}} of extra time began with Arsenal kicking off {{facing the same}} way as in the second half, with the low sun at their backs. Within a minute, a move which began with Larry Lloyd deep within Liverpool's half found Heighway in space on the left flank. He sent a low ball {{from the edge of the}} penalty area which went behind the {{advancing}} Wilson and into the Arsenal net. Two minutes later John Toshack almost made it two, with a sharp reflex save required from Wilson to prevent further damage to Arsenal's cause. Liverpool continued to dominate for the next ten minutes, but without any clear chances. This pressure left some holes in Liverpool's defence, however, and in the eleventh minute of extra time an overhead kick from John Radford into the Liverpool penalty area led to a scrambled attempt to clear the ball which saw the <b>ball</b> <b>end</b> up in the net. Initially, it appeared as if Graham had got the final touch, but later replays showed that it was Kelly, who became the first substitute ever to score in an FA Cup final. Clemence was forced to make a brave save two minutes from the end of the half after a centring cross almost found Kelly deep in the Liverpool area. The last chance of the half came from a strong shot from distance by Radford which went straight to Clemence.|$|E
