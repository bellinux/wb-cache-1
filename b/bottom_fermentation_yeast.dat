40|$|One of {{the most}} popular and widely used {{alcoholic}} beverages is beer. There is a long-standing tradition of beer production in the Czech Republic and it is our significant export commodity. Hops, specifically the so called Saaz Late, is a typical ingredient in the production of bottom fermented a Pilsen kind of beer that has made us famous in the world. Beer is a complicated beverage and its production is not an easy process, although it may seem differently at first glance. Apart from the convenient ingredients, for the production of beer are also needed technological facilities and most importantly the knowledge. The procedure itself consists of grinding malt, mixing it with water and mashing process, which includes a shortage of polysaccharide chains by influence of malt enzymes. The extracted product is called hopped wort and it is further boiled together with hops. This process is in Czech language known as chmelovar (hereinafter referred to as wort). During the wort, there are some bitter substances coming to work (this is how mixture of ingredients and water is generally called during the whole process of production), the bitter substances are specifically alfa bitter acids and beta bitter acids. The extracted product is called hopped wort. After fermenting the hopped wort, there comes a stage of main and secondary fermentation. During this phase two crucial ingredients of beer are produced. Alcohol and carbon dioxide. Traditional for Czech regions is the <b>bottom</b> <b>fermentation</b> in which <b>yeasts</b> are descending to the base of a container. Biogenic amines are one of many components of the beer. However, they can be found not only in the beer, but also in almost all basic foods. We can find them in meat, fish, vegetables and fruits, and even in different concentrations. Their production is often associated with the fermentation process. Regarding the content of biogenic amines in beer, due to the research it is obvious that a part of them gets into the beer from the original raw materials. Another part arises during the fermentation process. Tyramine and histamine (among others), discovered in the beer, can have a serious impact on human health. During the consumption of large quantities of such a beer, but even other foods that contain a lot of these biogenic amines, it may affect the circulatory system, breathing, cause a facial flushing and in extreme cases even cerebral haemorrhage. The intoxication by histamine is often manifested as food poisoning or allergic reactions...|$|R

However, spontaneous fermentation strengthens local characteristics of wine and offers opportunities for technological innovation.

40|$|Abstract Background Cellulose, {{which is}} the most {{abundant}} renewable biomass on earth, is a potential bio-resource of alternative energy. The hydrolysis of plant polysaccharides is catalyzed by microbial cellulases, including endo-β- 1, 4 -glucanases, cellobiohydrolases, cellodextrinases, and β-glucosidases. Converting cellobiose by β-glucosidases is the key factor for reducing cellobiose inhibition and enhancing the efficiency of cellulolytic enzymes for cellulosic ethanol production. Results In this study, a cDNA encoding β-glucosidase was isolated from the buffalo rumen fungus Neocallimastix patriciarum W 5 and is named NpaBGS. It has a length of 2, 331 bp with an open reading frame coding for a protein of 776 amino acid residues, corresponding to a theoretical molecular mass of 85. 1 kDa and isoelectric point of 4. 4. Two GH 3 catalytic domains were found at the N and C terminals of NpaBGS by sequence analysis. The cDNA was expressed in Pichia pastoris and after protein purification, the enzyme displayed a specific activity of 34. 5 U/mg against cellobiose as the substrate. Enzymatic assays showed that NpaBGS was active on short cello-oligosaccharides from various substrates. A weak activity in carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) digestion indicated that the enzyme might also have the function of an endoglucanase. The optimal activity was detected at 40 °C and pH 5 [*]~[*] 6, showing that the enzyme prefers a weak acid condition. Moreover, its activity could be enhanced at 50 °C by adding Mg 2 + or Mn 2 + ions. Interestingly, in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) experiments using Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY 4741 or Kluyveromyces marxianus KY 3 as the <b>fermentation</b> <b>yeast,</b> NpaBGS showed advantages in cell growth, glucose production, and ethanol production over the commercial enzyme Novo 188. Moreover, we showed that the KY 3 strain engineered with the NpaNGS gene can utilize 2 % dry napiergrass as the sole carbon source to produce 3. 32 mg/ml ethanol when Celluclast 1. 5 L was added to the SSF system. Conclusion Our characterizations of the novel β-glucosidase NpaBGS revealed that it has a preference of weak acidity for optimal <b>yeast</b> <b>fermentation</b> and an optimal temperature of ~ 40 °C.

30|$|The {{consumption}} of ethanol {{as an alternative}} fuel has been steadily rising. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is commonly used in industrial-scale ethanol production due to several advantages it offers, including a highly efficient ethanol fermentation ability and a relatively high tolerance to fermentation stress (Boulton and Quain 2006). Generally, the maximum ethanol yields of a conventional <b>yeast</b> <b>fermentation</b> process are attained at 25 – 30  °C, which is the optimal temperature for yeast growth (Hohmann and Mager 2003). However, ethanol fermentation at high temperature {{has a number of}} benefits such as reducing cooling costs, preventing bacterial contamination, and enabling simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (Abdel-Banat et al. 2010). During ethanol <b>fermentation,</b> <b>yeast</b> cells simultaneously encounter several stresses, e.g. osmotic, ethanol, and oxidative stresses (Gibson et al. 2007). To achieve the efficient ethanol fermentation at high temperature, yeast strain that tolerates to not only heat stress but also other stresses present during fermentation is therefore indispensable. Moreover, an understanding of cellular mechanisms required for protecting yeast cells {{from a wide range of}} physical and chemical stressors is essential for the improvement of multi-stress tolerance in yeast.|$|R
