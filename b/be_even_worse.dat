5|$|The French {{started their}} {{evacuation}} with their pre-conceived notion that few {{would want to}} head south. As knowledge of the migration program spread through the communist-controlled north, thousands of predominantly northern Catholic asylum-seekers descended on the capital Hanoi and the port of Haiphong, {{both of which were}} still in French control. This led to anarchy and confusion as the emigrants fought over limited shelter, food, medicine and places on the ships and planes that were bound for the south. By early August, there were over 200,000evacuees waiting in Hanoi and Haiphong. Initially the ad hoc camps had insufficient sanitation and water quality control, leading to the possibility of outbreaks of disease. Some American representatives said that they were the worst conditions they had seen. The conditions continued to be poor and chaotic after the evacuation got into full swing, and did not improve significantly for a month. There was no organization infrastructure as far as registration or medical records and immunisation of the waiting evacuees. The communists thus sent their propaganda activists through the camps and said that the lack of organisation proved that life for prospective refugees would <b>be</b> <b>even</b> <b>worse</b> in the south, where they would be completely under the control of South Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|In July 1933, Trotsky {{was offered}} asylum in France by Prime Minister Édouard Daladier. Trotsky {{accepted}} the offer, {{but he was}} forbidden to live in Paris and soon found himself under the surveillance of the French Police. From July 1933 to February 1934, Trotsky and his wife lived in Royan. The philosopher and activist Simone Weil also arranged for Trotsky and his bodyguards {{to stay for a}} few days at her parents' house. Following the 6 February 1934 crisis in France, the French Minister of Internal Affairs, Albert Sarraut, signed a decree to deport Trotsky from France. However, no foreign government was found willing to accept Trotsky within its borders. As a result, the French authorities instructed Trotsky to move to a residence in the tiny village of Barbizon under the strict surveillance of the French Police, where Trotsky found his {{contact with the outside world}} to <b>be</b> <b>even</b> <b>worse</b> than what it had been during his exile in Turkey.|$|E
500|$|The {{staff at}} Idolator {{selected}} [...] "Million Reasons" [...] to review {{as part of}} their 'Rated & Reviewed' column series. Robbie Daw from the publication congratulated the singer for creating a [...] "super-produced" [...] country version of her 2011 single [...] "You and I". Rachel Sonis agreed and found it to be simple and sweet, awarding the track a rating of 8.5 out of 10. However, both Carl Williott and Mike Wass were disappointed, with the latter claiming: [...] "this era is shaping up to <b>be</b> <b>even</b> <b>worse</b> than I imagined." [...] It ultimately received an average score of 6.1/10 from the writers. Similarly, Bowman from the same website called it one of Joannes [...] "more forgettable tracks". Although The Atlantics Spencer Kornhaber found it to be a [...] "sturdily crafted" [...] single, he found Gaga to be neglectful of the song's details and claimed that American singer Taylor Swift could excel exceptionally better at the same craft.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, the Faculty of Mechanisation and Motorisation of the Military Technical Academy named after F.E. Dzerzhinsky {{developed}} two tank models (TMM-1 and TMM-2) {{based on the}} Vickers 6-Ton tank design but with an American Hercules [...] six-cylinder water-cooled engine, improved front armour (to 15–20mm), and a driver's position on the left side. TMM stands for tank maloy moshchnosti or [...] "tank of low power". The TMM-1 was equipped with transmission details from the native [...] (...) and a ball mount for the DT tank machine gun {{in front of the}} hull, whereas the TMM-2 was equipped with an improved gear box, a steering device without clutches and a 37mm Hotchkiss gun in the right turret. Representatives from the main Soviet tank manufacturers together with officials from the RKKA Mobilization Department considered the Hercules engine to be too difficult to produce, and the engine tended to overheat inside the engine compartment. Tests of TMM-1 and TMM-2 prototypes performed in the beginning of 1932 demonstrated no advantage over the Vickers 6-Ton and the T-26 (the TMM-2's maneuverability was found to <b>be</b> <b>even</b> <b>worse).</b>|$|E
500|$|Skírnir {{declares}} that when Gerðr comes out {{she will be}} a spectacle; Hrímgrímnir will [...] "glare" [...] at her, [...] "everything" [...] will stare at her, she will become more famous than the watchman of the gods, and that she will [...] "gape through the bars". Gerðr will experience [...] "madness and howling, tearing affliction and unbearable desire" [...] and that, in grief, tears will flow from her. Skírnir tells Gerðr to sit down, for her fate will <b>be</b> <b>even</b> <b>worse</b> yet. She will be harassed by fiends all her weary days. From the court of jötnar to {{the halls of the}} hrimthurs, Gerðr shall everyday crawl without choice, nor hope of choice. Gerðr will weep rather than feel joy, suffering tearfully. She will live {{the rest of her life}} in misery with a three-headed thurs or otherwise be without a man altogether. Skírnir commands for Gerðr's mind to be seized, that she may waste away with pining, and that she be as the thistle at the end of the harvest; crushed.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} a mixed critical response. In a review for Time magazine entitled [...] "Just Another Mississippi Whitewash", author Jack E. White described {{the film as}} a [...] "cinematic lynching of the truth". He wrote, [...] "It is bad enough that most Americans know next to nothing about {{the true story of}} the civil rights movement. It would <b>be</b> <b>even</b> <b>worse</b> for them to embrace the fabrications in Mississippi Burning." [...] Columnist Desson Howe of The Washington Post believed that the film [...] "speeds down the complicated, painful path of civil rights in search of a good thriller. Surprisingly, it finds it". He felt the film was a [...] "Hollywood-movie triumph that blacks could have used more of during – and since – that era." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader, lightly criticized Parker's direction, commenting that the film was [...] "sordid fantasy" [...] being [...] "trained on the murder of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964, and the feast for the self-righteous that emerges {{has little to do with}} history, sociology, or even common sense." [...] Rita Kempley of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "...like the South African saga Cry Freedom, it views the black struggle from an all-white perspective. And there's something of the demon itself in that. It's the right story, but with the wrong heroes." [...] Pauline Kael, writing for The New Yorker, praised the acting, but criticized the film's [...] "garish forms of violence" [...] and described it as [...] "morally repugnant".|$|E

2500|$|Current {{consensus}} is that the long-term prognosis of c-SCLC patients {{is determined by the}} SCLC component of their tumor, given that [...] "pure" [...] SCLC seems to have the worst long-term prognosis of all forms of lung cancer. Although data on c-SCLC is very sparse, some studies suggest that survival rates in c-SCLC may <b>be</b> <b>even</b> <b>worse</b> than that of pure SCLC, likely due to the lower rate of complete response to chemoradiation in c-SCLC, although not all studies have shown a significant difference in survival.|$|E
2500|$|Before the Iraq War began, Alexander {{supported}} {{sending troops}} to Iraq and expressed his agreement with President Bush that Iraq must {{be dealt with}} immediately. A year after the war began, Alexander stated that the Iraq War had provided [...] "lessons" [...] to the nation, but {{went on to say that}} American troops should not be withdrawn, saying [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>even</b> <b>worse</b> if we left before the job was done." [...] In 2007, Alexander touted implementing the Iraq Study Group recommendations, noting that he believes Bush will be viewed as a Truman-esque figure if he implements the Group's recommendations.|$|E
