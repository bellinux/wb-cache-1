40|$|The heat {{sealability}} of laminated films with linear {{low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) as the sealant materials was investigated. A laboratory heat sealer was used to study the response of laminated films to temperature, time, and pressure. Platen temperature was confirmed as primary factor in controlling heat-seal strength. Dwell time must be sufficiently long to bring the interfacial temperature to a desired level. When the desired heat-seal strength has been achieved, further increase of dwell time did not improved heat-seal strength. Platen pressure had little effect above the level required to flatten the materials for good contact. <b>Bar</b> <b>sealing</b> process window for each sample were developed. The optimum combination of platen temperature and dwell time for each laminated film can be obtained in the respective process windows. Strength of heat-seal and its failure modes are closely related. Plateau initiation temperature closely corresponds to the final melting point of sealant materials. Relatively higher platen temperature was required to seal laminated films with lower thermal conductance. Required dwell time corresponds closely to the heat flow rate of <b>bar</b> <b>sealing</b> process.

40|$|The {{formation}} of protein absorption droplets in {{the cells of}} the proximal convolution was studied in mouse kidney. Ox hemoglobin was administered intraperitoneally and kidney specimens were collected at intervals of 30 minutes to 4 days after injection. In the lumen of the nephron, hemoglobin was concentrated to an opaque mass whose relations with the brush border and the epithelium could be easily followed. It was found that hemoglobin passes through the brush border in between the microvilli, enters the channels of tubular invaginations at the bases of the brush border, and is transported in bulk into vacuoles in the intermediate cell zone. These vacuoles increase in size and are transformed through further concentration into dense absorption droplets. Using the opaque hemoglobin content of the nephron as a tracer, functional continuity of the system of the tubular invaginations with the lumen {{on one side and the}} vacuoles on the other was demonstrated. Mitochondria lie closely apposed to vacuoles and droplets, but are not primarily involved in droplet formation. 15 hours after injection and later, ferritin and systems of layered membranes become visible in the droplets as their density decreases. These membranes are interpreted as lipoprotein membranes; similar membranes are found in the lumen of the tubuli. It is suggested that phospholipids enter into the vacuoles together with hemoglobin from the tubular lumen and form membrane systems of lipoproteins in the droplets. At 3 to 4 days the droplets contain aggregates of ferritin, and the iron reaction becomes positive in the tubule cells. No significant changes were found in the Golgi apparatus or in the microbodies during hemoglobin absorption.

40|$|In September 2009 the European Union adopted Regulation 1007 / 2009 {{on trade}} in seal {{products}} (Basic Regulation) due to {{concerns over the}} welfare of seals in the non-indigenous commercial seal hunts, particularly in Canada. Throughout the policy-making process these moral concerns were a crucial element of {{the political will to}} <b>bar</b> <b>seal</b> products from the EU market. Also research carried out as part of the preparatory works leading to the Basic Regulation appeared to support the claim that the seal hunt, unless conducted by indigenous communities, is cruel and unnecessary, calling for a legislative response in the European Union. This dissertation screens the legislative process of the EU seal regime and considers in how far problem identification, goal setting and goal attainment are streamlined. Throughout this thesis it becomes obvious that also the claim of a European ‘moral concern’ is ambiguous although the Union successfully defended the regime under the ‘moral exception’ clause in international trade law. Even though animal welfare in general can be regarded as a Community value, the EU seal regime cannot be linked to other EU animal welfare laws as the regime does not have an impact on animal welfare in the seal hunts. Instead, the dissertation shows that, although the seal regime appears to be based on ‘objective’ scientific knowledge, it is based on an inherently biased approach towards the non-indigenous seal hunts. Indicative for the neglect of remote coastal communities in which the seal hunt is carried out is the lack of recognition of its socio-economic and cultural value for the people involved in it. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in a seal hunting community and in the processing industry this dissertation shows how closely interlinked the seal hunt at sea is with the social fabric on land. Indeed, a lack of knowledge on conditions in the sealing industry existed prior to the seal regime’s adoption although its impacts were expected to be drastic. In spite of this gap in knowledge the regime was adopted...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the presence of cyanide in the industrial aluminium electrolytic cell. Therefore, it was an aim of this investigation to identify the favoured regions of cyanide formation in potlining, and conduct parallel laboratory studies to determine some of the chemical factors likely to influence cyanide formation. The study was conducted in three stages. The first stage involved autopsies of cells of various ages, design and construction in detail. This was followed by extensive sampling of sections of the trenched sidewalls and cathode combined with chemical analyses of the specimens, to enable mapping of the cyanide distribution profiles. Examination of these profiles revealed that major amounts of cyanide were generally concentrated in the carbon sidewall region near the collector bars and to a lesser extent in the cathode near the mid-section of the pot. In particular, carbon that was heavily impregnated with metallic sodium and easily accessible to air ingress, was found to contain high concentrations of cyanide. Thus, from the cyanide profiles it: was evident that air ingress through the collector <b>bar</b> <b>seals</b> of the cathode, and sodium penetration of the carbon governed the favoured region for cyanide formation during normal pot operation. In the second stage, an examination of the kinetics of sodium cyanide formation in carbon-mix was performed in the laboratory. Metallic sodium was reacted with carbon and gaseous nitrogen over a range of temperatures. Rate plots derived from a combination of thermogravimetric and integral analysis techniques indicated that there was increasing reactivity with increase in sodium content during the initial stages of reaction. Furthermore, rate data obtained appeared to fit a second-order reaction relative to reactant sodium after the initial burst of reaction. Further laboratory investigations were conducted to establish the temperatures required for cyanide formation, and determine the susceptibility of different forms of carbon to cyanide generation. The carbon types ranged from plant derived carbon-mix through commercial preformed cathode material to high purity graphite. Whilst cyanide formation was found to readily occur in the temperature range of 500 - 600 °C in all the carbons tested, the less ordered carbon-mix was significantly more vulnerable. However, highly graphitised carbon was the least susceptible to cyanide formation within its structure. Moreover, the reaction was accelerated by the presence of small amounts of iron impurity. Laboratory tests also indicated that the predominant cyanide-containing species formed in potlinings was most likely uncomplexed sodium cyanide. The overall results obtained from laboratory studies were consistent with plant measurements and observations derived from the complex industrial situation. Conclusions drawn from this work may have implications in terms of future cell design, and the ultimate impact of spent potlinings on the surrounding environment...|$|R

40|$|Packaging protects food {{products}} from environmental influences, assuring quality and safety throughout shelf life if properly performed. Packaging quality {{depends on the}} quality of the packaging material and of the closure or seal. A common problem possibly jeopardizing seal quality is the presence of seal contamination, which can cause a decreased seal strength, an increased packaging failure risk and leak formation. Therefore, early detection and removal of seal contaminated packages from the production chain is crucial. In this work, a pulsed-type active thermography method using the heated <b>seal</b> <b>bars</b> as an excitation source was studied for detecting seal contamination. Thermal image sequences of contaminated seals were recorded shortly after sealing. The detection performances of six thermal image processing methods, based on a single frame, a fit of the cooling profiles, thermal signal reconstruction, pulsed phase thermography, principal component thermography and a matched filter, were compared. High resolution digital images served as a reference to quantify seal contamination, and processed thermal images were mapped to these references. The lowest detection limit (equivalent diameter 0. 60 mm) was obtained for the method based on a fit of the cooling profiles. Moreover, the detection performance of this method did not depend strongly on the time after sealing at which recording of the thermal images was started, making it a robust and generally applicable method. status: publishe...|$|R
