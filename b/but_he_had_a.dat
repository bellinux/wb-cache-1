Hugh served William fitzEmpress, the brother of King Henry II of England from the mid 1150s. William gave Hugh the manor of Harrietsham in Kent.|$|E
5|$|Sunday never {{attended}} seminary {{and made}} no pretense of being a theologian or an intellectual, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> thorough knowledge of the Bible and was well read on religious and social issues of his day. His surviving Winona Lake library of six hundred books gives evidence of heavy use, including underscoring and reader's notes in his characteristic all-caps printing. Some of Sunday's books were even those of religious opponents. He was later charged with plagiarizing a Decoration Day speech given by the noted agnostic Robert Ingersoll.|$|E

5|$|In 1922 Smith {{moved to}} Los Angeles in the United States, where he, Jane Wolfe, and Regina Kahl tried to {{establish}} a new Thelemite community. They founded an incorporated Church of Thelema which gave weekly public performances of the Gnostic Mass from their home in Hollywood. Seeking to revive the inactive North American O.T.O., in 1935 Smith then founded the O.T.O. Agape Lodge, which subsequently relocated to Pasadena. He brought a number of prominent Thelemites into the O.T.O., including Jack Parsons and Grady Louis McMurtry, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> strained relationship with both Crowley and Crowley's North American deputy, Karl Germer, who eventually ousted him from his position as Agape Lodge leader, replacing him with Parsons. Smith retreated to Malibu, where he continued to practice Thelema until his death.|$|E
5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Mota {{made the}} Expos out of spring {{training}} {{for the first time}} in his career. On May 12, he had a 1.59 ERA through his first 20 games of the year. However, eight earned runs allowed over his next six games raised his ERA to 4.00. Afterwards, though, he had a 2.08 ERA over his next 12 games. On June 17, he was the winning pitcher when he threw a scoreless inning in a 4–1 victory over Toronto. In his next game, on June 19, he was the losing pitcher when he gave up three runs (only one run was earned) without recording an out in a 4–1 loss to the New York Mets. However, after that 12-game stretch, he gave up five earned runs over his next four games to bring his ERA up to 4.29. On July 13, he was placed on the disabled list {{for the first time in}} his career with right shoulder tendinitis. Mota returned at the beginning of September, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> 10.57 ERA and two losses in his final 11 games of the year. He finished the season with a 1–3 record and a 5.26 ERA in 53 games.|$|E

5|$|Smith also {{purchased}} and raced Thoroughbred horses {{under the name}} Pleasant Valley Stable. His racing colors during the early 1890s were royal-purple and canary yellow. Smith's brother, Bill, became his principal horse trainer during the 1890s and early 1900s. One of his most successful horses was a two-year-old bay colt named King Cadmus. Smith purchased King Cadmus as a yearling in 1890 for $4,000 at the stable dispersal sale of the late August Belmont. The colt was a son of Kingfisher and was a full brother to another popular racehorse named King Crab. The horse only won two races in his entire racing career, but Smith won $195,000 from Cadmus' two victories. The first win occurred on September 3, 1891 at Sheepshead Bay Race Track and resulted in Smith winning approximately $115,000, which was the largest payout from a horse race recorded in the US at that time. Cadmus' other win occurred at Morris Park Racetrack in 1892 with Smith netting another $80,000. King Cadmus was a fast runner <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> vicious temperament, seriously injuring several of Smith's employees, in addition to weak legs and was sold as a three-year-old in 1892.|$|E

He rapidly consolidated himself in power, helped by the expelled faction of the Labor Party, the Democratic Labor Party, which directed its second preferences to the Liberals at elections. His populist attacks on the trade unions, intellectuals, protesters and the press won him a large following.|$|E
25|$|Casey {{was also}} a violinist and he loved to play Irish songs for his fellow friars during {{recreation}} time, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> terrible singing voice, attributed to his childhood speech impediment. Other friars could not refrain from rolling their eyes or coughing, so he would excuse himself politely and sneak down to the chapel to entertain an invisible audience at the tabernacle. The friar often fasted, but ate enough. Until his late seventies, {{he was able to}} join the younger religious in games of tennis and volleyball, and even went jogging on occasion.|$|E
25|$|Hick {{ended up}} playing in four Tests, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> rather poor series overall, {{averaging}} 25, although his defiant 68 in a losing cause at Perth {{stuck in the}} memory and his 39 and 60 contributed significantly to England's 12-run win at Melbourne (even if Dean Headley's 6–60 was more remarked upon). In the ODIs against both Australia and Sri Lanka Hick did much better, making more than 500 runs – including a fine run of 108, 66*, 126* and 109 in successive innings – and being named England's Man of the Series.|$|E
