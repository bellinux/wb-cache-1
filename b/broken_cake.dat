6000|$|... 'Now {{so it was}} that, since {{seeing him}} possess himself of the <b>broken</b> <b>cake,</b> she had insensibly begun to feel {{something}} {{that was more than}} curiosity, though perhaps less than anxiety, about this fellow-countryman of hers; and it was not in her nervous and sensitive heart to resist his appeal. She found his lodging (to which he had removed from the Old Rooms inn for economy) to be a room over a shop, half-way up the steep and narrow street of the old town, to which the fashionable visitors seldom penetrated. With some misgiving she entered the house, and was admitted to the chamber where he lay.|$|E
6000|$|We {{heard the}} bells of Herman Mordaunt's sleigh, {{on the other}} side of the barrier, but could see nothing. The <b>broken</b> <b>cakes,</b> pressed upon by {{millions}} of tons weight above, had risen fully ten feet, into an inclination that was nearly perpendicular; rendering crossing it next to impossible, even to one a-foot. Then came Herman Mordaunt's voice, filled with paternal agony, and human grief, to increase the awe of that dreadful moment! ...|$|R
5000|$|Opening the box, {{his father}} Thiruvengadar finds only three cow dung cakes, which he throws away in disgust. To his astonishment, {{precious}} stones gleam through the <b>broken</b> <b>cakes</b> and the sand bags hold gold dust. He rushes {{in to see}} his son Marudhavaanan (who is Lord Shiva himself), who has disappeared mysteriously, leaving only a small box with his mother Sivakalai. Thiruvengadar finds a Palm-leaf manuscript and a needle without an eyelet. On the script were the following words (in English for understanding): ...|$|R
60|$|All the men now stopped. They {{knew they}} were powerless: and intense anxiety {{rendered}} them averse to move. Attention appeared to interfere with their walking on the ice; and each held his breath in expectation. They saw that the schooner, then less than a cable's length from them, {{was close to the}} rocks; and the next shock, if anything like the last, must overwhelm her. To their astonishment, instead of being nipped, the schooner rose by a stately movement that was not without grandeur, upheld by <b>broken</b> <b>cakes</b> that had got beneath her bottom, and fairly reached the shelf of rocks almost unharmed. Not a man had left her; but there she was, placed on the shore, some twenty feet above the surface of the sea, on rocks worn smooth by the action of the waves! Had the season been propitious, and did the injury stop here, it might have been possible to get the craft into the water again, and still carry her to America.|$|R
60|$|Guert {{took the}} {{direction}} of everything. Even while we had been talking, the ice had moved materially; and we found ourselves fifty feet further from the island than we had been. By causing the horses to advance, this distance was soon recovered; but it was found impossible to lead or drive them over the <b>broken</b> <b>cakes</b> with which {{the shore of the}} island now began to be lined. After one or two spirited and determined efforts, Guert gave the matter up, and asked me to help the ladies from the sleigh. Never did women behave better, than did these delicate and lovely girls, on an occasion so awfully trying. Without remonstrances, tears, exclamations or questions, both did as desired; and I cannot express the feeling of security I felt, when I had helped each over the broken and grinding border of white ice, that separated us from the shore. The night was far from cold; but the ground was now frozen sufficiently to prevent any unpleasant consequences from walking on what would otherwise have been a slimy, muddy alluvion; for the island was so very low, as often to be under water, when the river was particularly high. This, indeed, formed our danger, after we had reached it.|$|R
5|$|Enraged by the deception, Fionna {{takes out}} the crystal sword to fight. The sword {{turns out to be}} another one of Ice Queen’s tricks and turns into a ball of ice around Fionna’s hands. Cake hears noises from downstairs and senses Fionna is in trouble. Undaunted, Fionna uses the ice to beat Ice Queen over the head. Ice Queen pushes her off with a burst of snow which allows Fionna to get close to enough to break Prince Gumball free and knock out the Ice Queen with a <b>broken</b> icicle. <b>Cake</b> bursts in and sees Gumball {{standing}} next to Fionna in her torn dress; she jumps to the wrong conclusion and lunges at him but Fionna stops Cake and tells her it was the Ice Queen all along. Just then Ice Queen recovers and blasts Cake away from Fionna only to have Fionna knock her magic tiara off which negates her powers. The real Gumball asks Fionna on a date and is turned down; Fionna notes that she does not need a boyfriend at the moment.|$|R
60|$|When Roswell Gardiner came on deck next morning, {{his first}} glance {{told him how}} little was the chance of his party's {{returning}} north that season. The strange floe had driven into the Great Bay, completely covering its surface, lining the shores far and near with <b>broken</b> and glittering <b>cakes</b> of ice; and, as it were, hermetically sealing the place against all egress. New ice, {{an inch or two}} thick, or even six or eight inches thick, might have been sawed through; and a passage cut even for a league, should it be necessary. Such things were sometimes done, and great as would have been the toil, our sealers would have attempted it, in preference to running the risk of passing a winter in that region. But almost desperate as would have been even that source of refuge, the party was completely cut off from its possession. To think of sawing through ice as thick as that of the floe, for any material distance, would be like a project to tunnel the Alps.|$|R
