5000|$|A typical [...] "design" [...] for a {{cash balance}} plan would provide each worker a [...] "hypothetical account" [...] and pay credits {{in the current}} year of say 5% of current salary. In addition, the cash balance plan would provide an {{interest}} credit of say 6% of the prior year’s balance in each worker’s [...] "hypothetical account" [...] so that the current year’s balance would be {{the sum of the}} prior year’s balance and the current year’s pay credit and an interest credit on prior year’s balance. For a worker who starts at age 25 with a $2000 a month starting salary, he would start with a zero account balance and the first year’s pay credit would be $1200 leaving him with an end of first year balance of $1200 in his [...] "hypothetical" [...] account. Because his beginning of first year balance was zero, his interest credit for the first year is also zero. In his second year, with a 3.5% salary increase his monthly salary would be $2070 on his 26th birthday. The 5% pay credit for this second year would be $1242. Because his second year [...] "hypothetical account" [...] starts the year with a $1200 balance, the interest credit at 6% would be $72. Adding the <b>beginning</b> <b>balance</b> of $1200 to the $1242 pay credit and $72 interest credit would give an ending balance in the [...] "hypothetical" [...] account of $2514 ($2514 = $1200 + $1242 + $72) for the second year. Repeat this process for each ensuing year until termination. This creates a hypothetical account balance from which the legally required benefit -- an annuity payable {{for the life of the}} participant or beneficiary who elects to commence payment at normal retirement age(NRA)—can be calculated.

40|$|A {{pervasive}} {{theme in}} both accounting and statistics is aggregation. However, {{in contrast to}} statistics, a customary standard for determining the best aggregation rule in accounting is unavailable or, at least, not explicitly defined. Also, most accounting procedures follow a well-specified recursive algorithm of updating a summarized history number (a <b>beginning</b> <b>balance</b> sheet number) by the current period's activities (changes). In this paper, we present a setting in which the best accounting aggregation rule arises naturally, resembles observed depreciation schedules, and proceeds recursively in a manner analogous to the above outlined stock-flow updating process. Our main results are (1) in every period, {{the performance of the}} BLU estimate based on active investments can be replicated by the period's depreciation amount and (2) in every period, the performance of the BLU estimate based on the entire history of investments can be replicated by a recursive procedure that updates the BLU estimate of the previous period with the current perioda's investment realization. Depreciation successfully satisfies multiple objectives - it serves as a periodic allocation of realized investment amounts and as a statistic for the unknown investment population mean. Depreciation schedules commonly used in practice, straight-line, accelerated and declining balance, are shown to be best in particular settings. ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} considered that two balance sheets, one {{at the beginning and}} one {{at the end of the}} period, and an income statements, together with its related retained earnings reconciliation statement, are raw materials for preparing the funds flow statement. The author has developed a new practice of preparing the statement directly from the accounts record, without balance sheets and other financial statements, for the purpose of presenting a method of reporting the flow of funds over any shorter period than a fiscal year A trial balance is prepared over a period on which the fund flow statement is intended to be made that consists of only entries of increase and decrease in every account based upon transactions taken place over the period. This trial balance may be called a " Funds Flow Trial Balance," which is defferent from the trial balance prepared under the usual accounting practice in that the former does not involve the figure of the <b>beginning</b> <b>balance</b> in each account The funds flow trial balance is the basic data with which the funds flow statement is provided, because this trial balance involves the same figures as the comparative balance sheet figures with which the funds flow statement is prepared under the traditional method. The funds flow trial balance can be prepared at any time, even in the middle of the fiscal year wherever the accounts record is available, without making financial statements, while it is only after the financial statements have been made that the comparative balance sheet figures can be provided. This method can be applied to the preparation of the fiscal fund flow statement, and it opens the way of determining the net income for the year from the fiscal funds flow statement. The author illustrates this process on a work sheet through which the reader may understand in more real feature the relationship between the flow of funds and of the income in a certain business entity. If the flow of funds could be presented with the revenue and expense on the financial statements, the latter would more clearly disclose the process of coming out the net income than they do at present and the more real extent of distributable amount of income would be measured. The author illustrates a form of combining the funds statement with the income statement and the retained earnings reconciliation statement, and combining the "Changes of Working 1 Capital" with the balance sheet...|$|E
