Inorganic binders {{are coming back}} to the foreground due to their ecologically friendly nature and new technologies for cores production and new <b>binder</b> <b>systems</b> were developed. Basically these <b>binder</b> <b>systems</b> are modified alkali silicates and therefore they carry some well-known unfavourable properties with their usage. To compensate these disadvantages, the <b>binder</b> <b>systems</b> are working with additives which are most often in powder form and are added in the moulding material. This paper deals with decoring behaviour of different moulding sands as well as the influence of chosen additives on knock-out properties in laboratory terms. For this purpose, specific methods of specimen production are described. Developed methods are then used to compare decoring behaviour of chosen sands and <b>binder</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

Consequently they can look very similar to a sand/cement screed Flow screeds are often {{preferred}} to traditional cement based screeds as they are faster to install and provide a similar finish. Flow screed is most often used in combination with underfloor heating installation as the reduced thickness provides for more effective and efficient heat transfer. One of the main advantages of liquid flow screed is that, it offers few additional benefits compared to sand and cement. It is anything but difficult to pour, with fluid properties that consider an expedient application and quicker drying time. There aren't any bigger advantages of this product than when combined with underfloor heatingsystem, a lesser thickness of liquid flooring screed, when compared with conventional screeds, minimises heat storage leading to a floor that reacts quickly to user requirement hence raising the efficacy of your underfloor heating method.|$|E

40|$|Portland cement {{concrete}} {{is the most}} used building material in the world. However, its manufacture is energy-intensive and it is susceptible to harsh environments. Alternative <b>binder</b> <b>systems</b> without ordinary Portland cement, such as geopolymers or alkali-activated materials, are recently new in the Civil Engineered world. These alternative <b>binder</b> <b>systems</b> seek, among other characteristics, improved durability and environmental efficiency. The attaining of strain hardening and multiple cracking typical of Strain Hardening Cementitious Composites (SHCC) using these alternative <b>binder</b> <b>systems</b> is very attractive from a conceptual point of view, since additional endurance to certain harsh or extreme environments, as well as enhanced durability, are usually expected as two of the main outcomes. In the present work, the behaviour of two different composites was studied: an existing Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC) and a new composite based on an alternative binder prepared with metakaolin. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibres were used in both materials. A series of experiments, including compressive and direct tensile testing were carried out to characterize and compare the mechanical properties of both materials. The {{results showed that the}} alternative binder composite, when subjected to uniaxial tension, developed multiple cracks at steadily increasing tensile stress and strain, which is also typical of ECCs showing strain hardening behaviour. The development of fibre reinforced geopolymer or alkali-activated materials showing strain hardening ability in tension may still be considered as a novel research topic, with great potential for creating new and interesting developments for Civil Engineering and structural applications, particularly the ones subjected to harsh environments...|$|R

40|$|This work {{examines}} the thermal transfer through porous media {{by means of}} measurement of the effective thermal conductivity and modelling of the structural parameters. While {{most of the work}} is of a general nature, the porous media in focus are pigment plus latex <b>binder</b> <b>systems</b> as used for paper coatings. As such, the application field of thermal effects in printing is discussed. At first the use of a dynamic measurement method for the thermal conductivity of porous coating pigment <b>binder</b> <b>systems</b> in the form of tablets is evaluated. In addition, a Lumped Parameter Model is developed to analyse the measured thermal conductivities in terms of the material volume fractions and their structural configuration. The model therefore uses two independent structural parameters instead of porosity alone as the governing parameter. This enables a discussion following modelling approaches adopting parameter modelling and structural modelling. A combination of both is used to discuss the solid-solid connectivity of pigment <b>binder</b> <b>systems.</b> It is shown by the model parameter of pigment connectivity that a disruption of the pigment packing already at low concentrations of binder occurs related to surface and colloid chemistry factors which cause the binder to accumulate first at pigment nodal points. The analysis of different pigment <b>binder</b> <b>systems</b> shows that, due to the presence of two interacting solid phases, the effective thermal conductivity cannot be modelled by using porosity and pore structure alone, but also requires the additional parameter of dual solid phase connectivity. It is proposed, therefore, that a combination of pore structure analysis and thermal conductivity measurement can be used to identify and parameterise subtleties in interactive particulate systems. For the application of toner fusing in electrophotography it is shown that a thermally insulating coating layer leads to a concentration of the fusing energy on the surface, thus aiding the fusing/adhesion development of the toner while shielding the base paper from undesired heating. In the heatset web-offset drying process, an insulating precoating in combination with liquid barrier properties can lead to a similar shielding of the base paper and thus helps to maintain an even moisture profile effectively reducing the waving/fluting tendency...|$|R
