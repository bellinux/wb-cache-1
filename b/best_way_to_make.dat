5|$|Rowling {{was left}} in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter. She {{obtained}} an Order of Restraint, and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994. She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University, after completing her first novel while living on state benefits. She wrote in many cafés, especially Nicolson's Café (owned by her brother-in-law), and the Elephant House, wherever she could get Jessica to fall asleep. In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local cafés to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in cafés was that taking her baby {{out for a walk}} was the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her fall asleep.|$|E

The final step was to saw the slab into pencils. This resulted in a wooden lead graphite pencil that was just under a half inch thick.|$|E
25|$|An {{article in}} the American journal for Economics has {{addressed}} the issue of Utilitarian ethics within redistribution of wealth. The journal stated that taxation of the wealthy is the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> use of the disposable income they receive. This says that the money creates utility for the most people by funding government services. Many utilitarian philosophers, including Peter Singer and Toby Ord, argue that inhabitants of developed countries in particular have an obligation to help to end extreme poverty across the world, for example by regularly donating some of their income to charity. Peter Singer, for example, argues that donating some of one's income to charity could help to save a life or cure somebody from a poverty-related illness, which is a much better use of the money as it brings someone in extreme poverty far more happiness than it would bring to oneself if one lived in relative comfort. However, Singer not only argues that one ought to donate a significant proportion of one's income to charity, but also that this money should be directed to the most cost-effective charities, in order to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number, consistent with utilitarian thinking. Singer's ideas have formed the basis of the modern effective altruist movement.|$|E

But the Jews among them—Perle, Wolfowitz, William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, et al.—are more likely to speak about freedom and democracy than about Halakha (Jewish law).

2500|$|Some {{opponents of}} the childfree choice {{consider}} such a choice to be selfish. The rationale of this position is the assertion that raising children {{is a very important}} activity and so not engaging in this activity must therefore mean living one's life in service to one's self. The value judgment behind this idea is that individuals should endeavor to make some kind of meaningful contribution to the world, but also that the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such a contribution is to have children. [...] For some people, one or both of these assumptions may be true, but others prefer to direct their time, energy, and talents elsewhere, in many cases toward improving the world that today's children occupy (and that future generations will inherit).|$|E

Due to the inability of the state to extinguish the criminal organizations, the population no longer trusts the government to get the protection they need.

Schleicher wanted the [...] "New State" [...] to enjoy popular legitimacy, and was increasing convinced that Papen's massive unpopularity would denude the [...] "New State" [...] of any legitimacy. On 27 October 1932, the Supreme Court of Germany in a convoluted ruling declared that Papen's coup deposing the Prussian government was illegal as Papen's lawyers had failed to prove his claim that the coup was necessary because the Social Democrats and Communists were allegedly about to merger, but also allowed for Papen to retain his control of Prussia, giving no means for Braun to resume office as {{the court ruled that}} the Reich government could depose a Land government if law and order were threatened. In November 1932, Papen showed his contempt for the terms of the Treaty of Versailles by passing an umbau (rebuilding) programme for the German Navy of one aircraft carrier, six cruisers, six destroyer flotillas, sixteen U-boats and six battleships, intended to allow Germany to control both the North Sea and the Baltic. Versailles had forbidden Germany to have battleships, aircraft carriers and submarines.|$|E

30|$|When {{evaluating}} {{the performance of}} a waste stabilization pond, it is imperative to consider additional factors that impact the performance of the pond beyond the mere parameters that have been previously discussed. One of the <b>best</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the determinations is by using modeling software. Although its popularity began in the mid- 1990 s, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has evolved parallel to the advancement of computer technology. CFD models the performance of the pond in removing nutrients, BOD, sedimentation, and pathogens. CFD can vary with meteorological conditions, pond orientation, and design adjustments (Sah et al. 2012). CFD benefits the researcher insomuch as he or she is able to determine how varying the effects of conditions within waste stabilization ponds would affect the performance of removing various constituents. This is beneficial whenever the conditions are unfavorable for sampling (Karteris et al. 2005).|$|R
