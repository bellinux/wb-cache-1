50|$|The {{majority}} of scroll saws offer a small {{light on a}} flexible arm that illuminates the work area and a dust <b>blower</b> <b>nozzle</b> to keep the work space clear while working. Table-tilting enables angled cuts to be made precisely and easily. Variable-speed support allows even finer control over cuts when working with delicate materials or when making intricate cuts.|$|E
40|$|<b>Blower</b> <b>nozzle</b> {{zones of}} a blast furnace are studied. The {{purpose is to}} study the <b>blower</b> <b>nozzle</b> zones as a {{controlled}} entity; to develop the methods of the state control of <b>blower</b> <b>nozzle</b> zones {{as the basis for}} the construction of the <b>blower</b> <b>nozzle</b> control system of the blast furnace process. Stable procedures for testing the hypothesis on the absence of the heat state break of the <b>blower</b> <b>nozzle</b> zone with respect to the estimation choosed for an average temperature over the blower emsemble are developed. A method for the state control of <b>blower</b> <b>nozzle</b> zones has been developed and defended by the inventor's sertificate. Algorithms for the identification and the control of the <b>blower</b> <b>nozzle</b> zone state have been developed and tested under an industrial conditions. A strukture of the adaptive automatic control system for the <b>blower</b> <b>nozzle</b> zone state of a blast furnace has been developed. The algorithms developed for the state control of the <b>blower</b> <b>nozzle</b> zone have been used for the automatic process control system introduced and designedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{converting}} and autogenous melting of copper concentrate was studied. Sonore and colour signals, radiated by vertical exigen blown converter during the blister copper obtaintion process were investigated. The general mathematical model was developed. A method {{for control of}} <b>blower</b> <b>nozzle</b> position in the converter was done. The possibility of diagnose of <b>blower</b> <b>nozzle</b> tip state was developed. The automatic control system of technological process of blister copper obtention in the vertical converter was developed. The results obtained {{was used in the}} plantAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose is}} to develop the methods of the {{intensification}} of the coal dust fuel burning aimed at the increase of the consumption of this fuel and the decrease of the consumption of coke. A technique for calculating {{the rate of the}} coal dust fuel burning in a <b>blower</b> <b>nozzle</b> zone of a blast furnace is developed. A method of the intensification of the coal dust fuel burning due to the redistribution of an oxidant in the <b>blower</b> <b>nozzle</b> appratus and the system of the individual oxygen feed into blower nozzles of a blast furnace are developed. The design of the system of the individual oxygen feed into blower nozzles of a blast furnace has been completed and introducedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
