25|$|The Deoxidized Metal Co. of Bridgeport in 1885 {{secured a}} {{contract}} for the bronze balusters required for the wew Treasury building in Washington, D.C. These balusters were an elaborate design incorporating leaves, beads and moulding, all intended to have a <b>bright</b> <b>finish,</b> which required {{a great deal of}} hand work. Deoxidized could make, but not burnish, the balusters and sought to subcontract this work, but no one took them up on their offer. At that time there was no machinery for polishing metals, the usual procedure was to immerse in acid, and hand work was too costly. The contract from Washington definitely stated that acid was not to be used.|$|E
2500|$|Polishing and buffing are {{finishing}} {{processes for}} smoothing a workpiece's surface using an abrasive and a work wheel or a leather [...] strop. Technically polishing refers to processes that use an abrasive that is {{glued to the}} work wheel, while buffing uses a loose abrasive applied to the work wheel. Polishing is a more aggressive process while buffing is less harsh, {{which leads to a}} smoother, brighter finish. A common misconception is that a polished surface has a mirror <b>bright</b> <b>finish,</b> however most mirror bright finishes are actually buffed.|$|E

50|$|The keys to {{its appeal}} were {{that it looked}} superficially like the very much finer and very much more {{expensive}} blown iridescent glass by Tiffany, Loetz and others and also that the cheerful <b>bright</b> <b>finish</b> caught the light even in dark corners of the home.|$|E
50|$|The 2011 season {{proved to}} be a good start {{throughout}} the league. Louth qualified for the Division 3 Final where they faced Westmeath. The final {{proved to be}} a very tense but <b>bright</b> <b>finish</b> as Louth ran out winners on a scoreline of 1-15 to 0-13.|$|E
50|$|The {{most popular}} {{stovetop}} kettles {{are made with}} stainless steel. This {{is due to the}} lightweight nature of the kettle, in addition to the <b>bright</b> <b>finish</b> and durability. The crack-resistant nature of the kettle also makes it easier to clean. Kettles can also be made from copper, iron, aluminum, polished chrome or ceramic.|$|E

50|$|May Hill {{remained}} in {{training as a}} four-year-old, and was campaigned mainly in staying races, but failed to win in five attempts. On her seasonal debut she finished third to Marco Ricci and Major Green in the Paradise Stakes over two miles at Ascot in May and then ran second on her next appearance. She then sustained a serious injury when running third behind Mr Bigmore in the Lymm Stakes at Haydock. She was then off the racecourse until autumn, when the best of her two runs came when she finished third to <b>Bright</b> <b>Finish</b> and Shangamuzo in the Jockey Club Cup.|$|E
50|$|The opening {{theme is}} a {{powerful}} chorale, originally given over a march, in which the rhythmic thundering of the timpani recalls certain passages in the opening movement. The second subject, a song-theme, is remarkable in that it recollects not only its counterpart in the first movement but also the Adagio. The third subject is a march-theme, which is a direct reworking of {{the introduction to the}} third subject group of the opening movement. In the recapitulation, this third theme is presented as a fugue which leads to the solemn coda and the splendid, <b>bright</b> <b>finish</b> to the symphony.|$|E

50|$|Lee Holdsworth {{recovered}} from his penalty for a fine seventh position.

He did take up 18th grid spot however and fought his way back through the field. Jason <b>Bright</b> <b>finished</b> eighth in a season best result for the struggling Britek Motorsport team.|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} seven minutes of the game, Bright was knocked {{unconscious}} three times by blows from Oklahoma A&M defensive tackle Wilbanks Smith.

Soon afterward, the injury forced him to leave the game. <b>Bright</b> <b>finished</b> the game with less than 100 yards, {{the first time in his}} three-year collegiate career. Oklahoma A&M eventually won 27-14.|$|R
5000|$|Unless {{a mirror}} surface is truly smooth, image quality falls off rapidly with distance. Chinese bronze mirrors {{included}} both smooth plane mirrors and precisely curved mirrors of <b>bright</b> <b>finish</b> and high reflectivity. Needham and Wang (1962: 91) say, [...] "That high-tin bronze (specular metal) was used from Zhou times onward is certain, {{and that it}} was sometimes coated with a layer of tin by heating above 2300°C. is highly probable; this would give at least 80% reflectivity." [...] Later the tin was deposited by means of a mercury amalgam, as recorded in the Baopuzi (4, above).|$|E

At Royal Ascot, he ran in the two and three quarter mile Queen Alexandra Stakes and finished second behind the six-year-old John Cherry, who, as a gelding, {{was not allowed to}} compete in many of the major staying races. Later in June, Shangamuzo reverted to handicaps and ran one of his few poor races when unplaced behind Tug of War in the Northumberland Plate.|$|E

5000|$|The Remington R51 uses an {{internal}} hammer {{with a built-in}} drop safety and features a single-action trigger. [...] The slide stop is mostly recessed into {{the left side of}} the frame. The primary safety is a grip safety which must be depressed before the pistol will fire. [...] The R51 lacks the magazine safety that was present on the original model 51. The trigger guard is undercut to allow a higher grip on the frame. [...] The frame has a 20-degree grip angle designed for natural point shooting, and has checkering on the front strap for improved purchase on the gun.

Later that month he was sent to Royal Ascot and recorded his first major success in the King George V Stakes and was then stepped up in distance to win a minor event over two miles at Newcastle Racecourse. Shangamuzo's winning run came to an end when he finished fifth in a race at Newbury and he then finished third to Sir Montagu and the future Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Alverton in the Ebor Handicap at York in August. On his next appearance, Shangamuzo defeated Alverton by one and a half lengths in the Top Rank Club Handicap at Newcastle to win his fifth race of the season. In October, the colt was moved up in class and finished second to <b>Bright</b> <b>Finish</b> in the Group Three Jockey Club Cup over two miles at Newmarket.|$|E
