5|$|Meanwhile, Tom (Aziz Ansari) asks Andy (Chris Pratt), April (Aubrey Plaza), Jerry (Jim O'Heir) and Donna (Retta) to {{participate}} in a new game show called Know Ya Boo, that he is hoping to pitch to networks; he admits that it is a rip-off of The Newlywed Game. It quickly becomes clear that Jerry and Donna know much more about each other than the recently married Andy and April. When April reveals her favorite band is Neutral Milk Hotel and not Andy's band Mouse Rat, Andy angrily leaves the game and they later have a big fight which causes him to quit his music. April seeks advice from Ann because, although she dislikes her, Ann previously dated Andy for several years. Ann tells April she has to <b>be</b> <b>supportive</b> of Andy no matter how she feels. The next day, April brings the other members of Mouse Rat to city hall and surprises Andy by singing one of his songs. A thrilled Andy reconciles with April.|$|E
5|$|Quinn and Finn go {{together}} for her ultrasound appointment, and {{they learn that}} she is expecting a girl. Finn, trying to <b>be</b> <b>supportive,</b> suggests they name the baby Drizzle, but Quinn is adamant she is having it adopted and is annoyed at his lack of understanding. Will, tired of his wife Terri's (Jessalyn Gilsig) refusal to let him participate in the pregnancy, sets up an appointment with Terri's OB/GYN so he can see their own baby on the ultrasound. With {{the help of her}} sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen), Terri blackmails her doctor into faking the sonogram using Quinn's ultrasound DVD, in order to continue hiding the fact she isn't really pregnant. Meanwhile, Quinn angrily confronts Rachel about her relationship with Finn and threatens her.

25|$|The most {{important}} duty of a psychiatric nurse {{is to maintain}} a positive therapeutic relationship with patients in a clinical setting.

Since the overturn of socialism in the Soviet bloc, the CPC (ML) has largely abandoned its previously strident anti-revisionist position.

It prints the English language edition of the Cuban Communist Party's newspaper, Granma, for Canadian distribution.|$|E

When Sir Robert proposed to Jane, he was heard to have said that she would never marry as long as Herrington House still stood.|$|E
25|$|The Malaysian {{information}} technology (IT) sector {{is made up}} equally of women and men, {{with large numbers of}} women employed as university professors and in the private sector. This is a product of two historical trends: the predominance of women in the Malay electronics industry, the precursor to the IT industry, and the national push to achieve a ‘pan-Malayan’ culture beyond the three ethnic groups of Indian, Chinese and Malay. Government support for the education of all three groups is available on a quota basis and, since few Malay men are interested in IT, this leaves more room for women. Additionally, families tend to <b>be</b> <b>supportive</b> of their daughters’ entry into this prestigious and highly remunerated industry, in the interests of upward social mobility. Malaysia's push to develop an endogenous research culture should deepen this trend.|$|E

25|$|With regular police {{raids on}} people known to <b>be</b> <b>supportive</b> of the Angry Brigade and with Mendleson a wanted person (although for cheque fraud only), {{the police were}} {{interested}} in finding any addresses where she might be found. Mendleson was keeping in regular touch with her family in Stockport and a police informer there passed the Amhurst Road address to police on 18 August 1971. An observation was set up and when Jim Greenfield was seen leaving the flat, a search warrant was obtained. At 4:15 PM on 20 August the police entered the flat and arrested Mendleson, Creek, Barker and Greenfield. Mendleson again gave her name as 'Nancy Pye'. The police reported that their searches of 359 Amhurst Road discovered not only duplicating equipment on which Angry Brigade publications had been produced, but a stick of gelignite, two submachine guns, a Browning pistol and 81 rounds of ammunition. Mendleson was remanded in custody at Holloway Prison and was eventually charged with possession of the armaments and conspiracy to cause explosions. Mendleson's fingerprints were found on a copy of Rolling Stone magazine used to wrap a bomb planted at the Italian consulate in Manchester, and she was also charged with attempting to cause this explosion.|$|E
500|$|Actress Joy Kilpatrick {{was cast}} as Dawson's photo double. Dawson {{described}} {{having a great}} working relationship with her stand-in. Discussing Kilpatrick, she said, [...] "I {{was about to tell}} her what I was going to be doing so she could give me the beats that I could react to properly" [...] and found her to <b>be</b> <b>supportive</b> and intuitive. Kilpatrick was not credited for her performance in the episode. Kolbe noted that the episode used a lot of visual effects, specifically to create the illusion of the two versions of Torres. The casting of a photo double allowed Kolbe avoid relying on split screen. The scheduling was carefully planned to account for the make-up used for both roles.|$|E

He received online abuse for expressing his opinion, including messages that were described as [...] "vile" [...] by Police Scotland; one referred to the Dunblane massacre. A few days after the vote, in which a 55% majority opposed Scottish independence, Murray said that he did not regret stating his view, but said that it was out of character and that he would concentrate on his tennis career in the future.|$|E
