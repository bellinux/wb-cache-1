[...] According to Andrew Lycett, Fleming's biographer, [...] "within the first few pages... had introduced most of Bond's idiosyncrasies and trademarks", which included his looks, his Bentley and his smoking and drinking habits. The full details of Bond's martini were kept until chapter seven {{of the book and}} Bond eventually named it [...] "The Vesper", after Lynd. Bond's order, to be served in a deep champagne goblet, was for [...] "three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel." ...|$|E

[...] Robert Bianco of USA Today called the first episode a [...] "vulgarized premiere" [...] that detracted from the film's qualities, but called the second one a [...] "sweeter, funnier improvement". Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times wrote of the pacing that the [...] "satirical silence or non-sequitur scenes slowly compiled to establish tone" [...] in the film, but were sacrificed for the faster pace of a network TV show.Mirna Valerio ...|$|E
500|$|Shōshi was 16 to 19 when Murasaki {{joined her}} court. According to Arthur Waley, Shōshi was a serious-minded young lady, whose living {{arrangements}} were divided between her father's household and her court at the Imperial Palace. She gathered around her talented women {{writers such as}} Izumi Shikibu and Akazome Emon—the author of an early vernacular history, The Tale of Flowering Fortunes. The rivalry that existed among the women is evident in Murasaki's diary, where she wrote disparagingly of Izumi: [...] "Izumi Shikibu is an amusing letter-writer; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> not very satisfactory about her. She has a gift for dashing off informal compositions in a careless running-hand; but in poetry she needs either an interesting subject or some classic model to imitate. Indeed {{it does not seem}} to me that in herself she is really a poet at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Film score {{composer}} James Newton Howard {{was approached}} by Shyamalan to work on Unbreakable immediately after scoring The Sixth Sense. [...] "He sat there and storyboarded the whole movie for me", Howard said. [...] "I've never had a director do that for me." [...] Shyamalan wanted a [...] "singularity" [...] tone for the music. [...] "He wanted something that was very different, very distinctive, that immediately evoked the movie when people heard it," [...] Howard explained. Howard and Shyamalan chose to simplify the score, and minimized the number of instruments (strings, trumpets and piano), with limited orchestrations. Some compositions were recorded in a converted church in London. [...] "You could have recorded the same music in a studio in Los Angeles, {{and it would have}} been great, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> about the sound of that church studio," [...] Howard remarked.

500|$|... "One Wonderful Day" [...] also {{introduced}} the second-season mystery surrounding Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) and Matthew Applewhite (Mehcad Brooks). Cherry revealed, [...] "they {{come on the}} street; they seem like nice people — but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful {{all at the same}} time." [...] Another scene featuring the Applewhite family, in which Betty brings food to a prisoner in their basement, was cut from this episode but was used in the second season premiere, [...] "Next". Cherry's inspiration for the Lynette storyline came from his own childhood experience when his mother returned to work. He commented: [...] "The predicament of any working woman is that you can love your career, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something...</b> to be said for getting to stay home every day with your kids, and you don't want anyone else to be better at it than you are. Felicity Huffman expressed satisfaction with how her storyline was handled, explaining that Lynette [...] "didn't deal with [...] in the most straightforward way, but she was fighting for her family. They were noble motives." [...] While discussing the courtroom scene in which Carlos attacks John, Ricardo Antonio Chavira commented: [...] "People can see the full rage that is in my character. I'm yelling at him, 'I'm gonna kill you'... Then I broke into Spanish: [...] "Yo voy a matar!"... I just went for it... Then I looked, and Jesse [...] had the most honest look of sheer terror. I think I scared the living shit out of him." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} music critics. [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times noted similarities between [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and [...] Beyoncé's previous singles including [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and [...] "If I Were a Boy", [...] {{and concluded that}} Beyoncé [...] "certainly knows how to dump a man in style". Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] could be [...] "Irreplaceable Part Two" [...] and noted that Beyoncé's vocal performance brings depth to the song. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice wrote that the song is not as iconic as its reference point [...] "Irreplaceable", but [...] "nor is it as shady". He commended the optimism in the song's lyrics. Consequence of Sound writer Chris Coplan commented that the ballad is a powerful moment of self-realization, which is enhanced by Beyoncé's vocal performance [...] "as [...] wounded bird turned resilient lioness". Choosing [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] as the highlight of 4, Andy Kellman of Allmusic described it as [...] "a bombastic kiss-off saved by Beyoncé's ability to plow through it". Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly noted the moderate chart performance of [...] "Run the World (Girls)", and wrote: [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] finds Beyoncé mining {{the same kind of}} girl-power imagery as she did on 'Run the World (Girls)'. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> more direct and honest about the lyrics on the new single (perhaps it's the instant greatness of the line, 'When I think of the time I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you'). 'Best Thing I Never Had' feels like the kind of crossover hit that will help 4 join the rest of Beyoncé's discography in multiplatinum land.|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{preceding}} quote {{has often been}} misinterpreted as Vivekananda implying that everything is predetermined.

[...] Vivekananda never said things were absolutely determined and placed emphasis on the power of conscious choice to alter one's past karma: [...] "It is the coward and the fool who says this is his fate.

After a series of severe coughs and almost fainting, Violetta begins to feel dizzy and asks her guests to go ahead and to leave her to rest until she recovers. While the guests dance in the next room, Violetta looks at her pale face in her mirror. Alfredo enters and expresses his concern for her fragile health, later declaring his love for her (Alfredo, Violetta: Un dì, felice, eterea – [...] "One day, happy and ethereal"). At first, she rejects him because his love means nothing to her, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> about Alfredo that touches her heart.

2500|$|The {{record deal}} with Reprise Records for the That Was The Year That Was album also gave Reprise {{distribution}} rights for his earlier recordings, as Lehrer wanted {{to wind up}} his own record imprint. The Reprise issue of Songs by Tom Lehrer was a stereo re-recording. This version was not issued on CD, but the songs were issued on the live Tom Lehrer Revisited CD. The [...] recording included bonus tracks [...] "L-Y" [...] and [...] "Silent E", two of the ten songs that Lehrer wrote for the PBS children's educational series The Electric Company. Lehrer later commented that worldwide sales of the recordings under Reprise surpassed 1.8 million units in 1996. That same year, the album That Was The Year That Was went gold. [...] The album liner notes (and Lehrer himself in one routine) promote his songs with self-deprecating humor. [...] ("I know it's very bad form to quote one's own reviews, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> the New York Times said about me , that I have always treasured: Mr. Lehrer's muse [...] not fettered by such inhibiting factors as taste.") ...|$|E

2500|$|Aware of Blake's visions, William Wordsworth commented, [...] "There was {{no doubt}} that this poor man was mad, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> in the madness of this man which {{interests}} me more than the sanity of Lord Byron and Walter Scott." [...] In a more deferential vein, writing in A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature, John William Cousins wrote that Blake was [...] "a truly pious and loving soul, neglected and misunderstood by the world, but appreciated by an elect few", who [...] "led a cheerful and contented life of poverty illumined by visions and celestial inspirations". Blake's sanity was called into question {{as recently as the}} publication of the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, whose entry on Blake comments that [...] "the question whether Blake was or was not mad seems likely to remain in dispute, but {{there can be no doubt}} whatever that he was at different periods of his life under the influence of illusions for which there are no outward facts to account, and that much of what he wrote is so far wanting in the quality of sanity as to be without a logical coherence".|$|E
2500|$|Wordsworth {{returns to}} the ideas found within the {{complete}} ode many times in his later works. There is also a strong connection between the ode and Wordsworth's Ode to Duty, completed {{at the same time}} in 1804. The poems describe Wordsworth's assessment of his poetry and contains reflections on conversations held between Wordsworth and Coleridge on poetry and philosophy. The basis of the Ode to Duty states that love and happiness are important to life, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> else necessary to connect an individual to nature, affirming the narrator's loyalty to a benevolent divine presence in the world. However, Wordsworth was never satisfied with the result of Ode to Duty as he was with Ode: Intimations on Immortality. In terms of use of light as a central image, the ode is related to Peele Castle, but the light in the latter poem is seen as an illusion and stands in opposition to the ode's ideas. In an 1809 essay as part of his Essays upon Epitaphs for Coleridge's journal, The Friend, Wordsworth argued that people have intimations that there is an immortal aspect of their life and that without such feelings that joy could not be felt in the world. The argument and the ideas are similar to many of the statements in the ode along with those in The Prelude, Tintern Abbey, and [...] "We Are Seven". He would also return directly to the ode in his 1817 poem Composed upon an Evening of Extraordinary Splendor and Beauty where he evaluates his own evolving life and poetic works while discussing the loss of an early vision of the world's joys. In the Ode: Intimations on Immortality, Wordsworth concluded that he gives thanks that was able to gain even though he lost his vision of the joy in the world, but in the later work he tones down his emphasis on the gain and provides only a muted thanks for what remains of his ability to see the glory in the world.|$|E
