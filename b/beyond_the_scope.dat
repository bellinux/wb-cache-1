5|$|The {{history of}} {{logarithm}} in seventeenth century Europe is {{the discovery of}} a new function that extended the realm of analysis <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of algebraic methods. The method of logarithms was publicly propounded by John Napier in 1614, in a book titled Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (Description of the Wonderful Rule of Logarithms). Prior to Napier's invention, there had been other techniques of similar scopes, such as the prosthaphaeresis or the use of tables of progressions, extensively developed by Jost Bürgi around 1600.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the {{regulation}} of executive action was met with judicial reluctance to intervene. Certain types of governmental discretion, exercised using prerogative powers, were regarded as <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of judicial scrutiny because they involved issues of substantive policy. However, developments focused on {{the substance of the}} issues at hand, rather than merely accepting that the prerogative power is non-justiciable per se. Simply put, the focus shifted from the source of the power to the subject matter.|$|E

5|$|Cantillon {{is one of}} the few economists {{cited by}} Adam Smith, who {{directly}} borrows Cantillon's sustenance theory of wages. Large sections of Smith's economic theory were possibly directly influenced by Cantillon, although in many respects Adam Smith advanced well <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of Cantillon. Some economic historians have argued that Adam Smith provided little of value from his own intellect, notably Schumpeter and Rothbard. In any case, through his influence on Adam Smith and the physiocrats, Cantillon was quite possibly the pre-classical economist who contributed most to the ideas of the classical school. Illustrative of this was Cantillon's influence on Say, which is noticeable in the methodology employed in the latter's Treatise on Political Economy.|$|E

Offensive counter-terrorist operations may include direct action and hostage recovery. A capability to board ships at anchor, ships underway and off-shore gas and oil platforms is also maintained. TAG (West) is kept at high readiness for a period of 12 months, before being replaced by another squadron in this role. The 2nd Commando Regiment provides Tactical Assault Group (East) to respond to domestic incidents on the east coast of Australia.|$|E

The sponsors are trying to have the bill amended to accommodate these victims. In 2015 the City of Chicago announced that it has established a $5.5 million fund for reparations to victims of torture by Burge, and to aid their families. By that time, the city had paid more than $57 million to victims of Burge and his cohort, and another $50 million for defense of the officers.|$|E

5|$|Most {{concurrent}} use proceedings {{result in a}} legal settlement between the parties. Frequently, one party will surrender its {{concurrent use}} claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each party may agree to geographic limitations on its use of the mark at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no confusion is likely. A benefit of such an agreement is that the parties can agree to terms <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> of the TTAB's decision, such as specific restrictions on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer confusion is likely to result from the concurrent use registration. Even if both parties assert that no confusion is likely, the TTAB may still make findings of fact which demonstrate that confusion is likely, and deny registration to the junior user of the mark.|$|E

40|$|A {{well-known}} {{problem in}} program generation is scoping.

Generation scoping offers control over identifier <b>scoping</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>scoping</b> mechanism of <b>the</b> target programming language (i. e., the language in which the generator output is expressed).
