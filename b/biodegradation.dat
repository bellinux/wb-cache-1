5|$|All {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods {{and would be}} harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics. Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified {{by a set of}} xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases. This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In ecology, these reactions are particularly important in microbial <b>biodegradation</b> of pollutants and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able to deal with a far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such as organochloride compounds.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 4,000 {{species of}} fungi, {{including}} lichen-forming {{species have been}} recorded from Malaysia. Of the two fungal groups with {{the largest number of}} species in Malaysia, the Ascomycota and their asexual states have been surveyed in some habitats (decaying wood, marine and freshwater ecosystems, as parasites of some plants, and as agents of <b>biodegradation),</b> but have not been or have been only poorly surveyed in other habitats (as endobionts, in soils, on dung, as human and animal pathogens); the Basidiomycota are only partly surveyed: bracket fungi, and mushrooms and toadstools have been studied, but Malaysian rust and smut fungi remain very poorly known. Without doubt, many more fungal species in Malaysia have not yet been recorded, and it is likely that many of those, when found, will be new to science.|$|E
5|$|The <b>biodegradation</b> of {{methoxyflurane}} begins {{immediately after}} the onset of exposure. The kidney and liver toxicity observed after anesthetic doses is attributable {{to one or more}} metabolites produced by O-demethylation of methoxyflurane. Significant products of this catabolic process include methoxyfluoroacetic acid (MFAA), dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), and inorganic fluoride. Methoxyflurane nephrotoxicity is dose dependent and irreversible, resulting from O-demethylation of methoxyflurane to fluoride and DCAA. This effect is so predictable and reproducible that methoxyflurane now serves as a pharmacologic model of fluoride-related nephrotoxicity, one with which newer drugs are compared. It is not entirely clear whether the fluoride itself is toxic—it may simply be a surrogate measure for some other toxic metabolite. The concurrent formation of inorganic fluoride and DCAA is unique to methoxyflurane biotransformation compared with other volatile anesthetics, and this combination is more toxic than fluoride alone. This may explain why fluoride formation from methoxyflurane is associated with nephrotoxicity, while fluoride formation from other volatile anesthetics (such as enflurane and sevoflurane) is not. Furthermore, the concurrent use of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.|$|E
5|$|The <b>biodegradation</b> of {{methoxyflurane}} produces {{inorganic fluoride}} and dichloroacetic acid (DCAA). The combined {{effects of these}} two compounds {{may be responsible for}} the toxicity of methoxyflurane to some of the major organs of the human body. Methoxyflurane was determined to be nephrotoxic (damaging to the kidneys) in a dose-dependent response and hepatotoxic (damaging to the liver) at anesthetic doses in 1973, and the drug was abandoned as a general anesthetic in the late 1970s. In 1999, the manufacturer discontinued distribution of methoxyflurane in the United States and Canada, and on September 6, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration determined that it should be withdrawn from the market for safety concerns. It is however still used in Australia as an emergency analgesic for the initial management of pain due to acute trauma, as well as for brief painful procedures such as changing of wound dressings or for transport of injured people.|$|E
25|$|Cleanup and {{recovery}} from an oil spill {{is difficult and}} depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, {{the temperature of the}} water (affecting evaporation and <b>biodegradation),</b> and the types of shorelines and beaches involved.|$|E
25|$|The {{thermophilic}} bacterium Brevibacillus borstelensis (strain 707) was isolated from a soil sample {{and found to}} use low-density polyethylene as a sole carbon source when incubated together at 50nbsp&°C. <b>Biodegradation</b> increased with time exposed to ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
25|$|Some {{companies}} produce biodegradable additives, {{to enhance}} <b>biodegradation.</b> Plastic can have starch powder added as a filler {{to allow it}} to degrade more easily, but this still does not lead to the complete breaking down of the plastic.|$|E
25|$|The GM2 gangliosidoses are a {{group of}} three related genetic {{disorders}} that result from a deficiency of the enzyme beta-hexosaminidase. This enzyme catalyzes the <b>biodegradation</b> of fatty acid derivatives known as gangliosides. The diseases are better known by their individual names.|$|E
25|$|Biodegradable {{plastics}} are plastics that degrade, {{or break}} down, upon exposure to: sunlight or ultra-violet radiation, water or dampness, bacteria, enzymes or wind abrasion. In some instances, rodent, pest, or insect attack {{can also be}} considered as forms of <b>biodegradation</b> or environmental degradation.|$|E
25|$|In biosphere, PCBs can be {{degraded}} {{by either}} bacteria or eukaryotes, but {{the speed of}} the reaction depends on both the number and the disposition of chlorine atoms in the molecule: less substituted, meta- or para- substituted PCBs undergo <b>biodegradation</b> faster than more substituted congeners.|$|E
25|$|McDonald's {{has been}} using a corn-based {{bioplastic}} to produce containers for some of its products. The environmental benefits of this technology are controversial, with critics noting that <b>biodegradation</b> is slow, produces greenhouse gases and that contamination of traditional plastic waste streams with bioplastics can complicate recycling efforts.|$|E
25|$|The City of North Miami {{claims that}} the only {{remaining}} environmental concerns at the site are Ammonia contamination in the groundwater, and methane from the <b>biodegradation</b> of the buried solid waste. There are treatment wells on-site to remove the ammonia, with an estimated completion time of 20 years.|$|E
25|$|Chloroform volatilizes readily from {{soil and}} surface water and {{undergoes}} degradation in air to produce phosgene, dichloromethane, formyl chloride, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen chloride. Its half-life in air ranges from 55 to 620 days. <b>Biodegradation</b> {{in water and}} soil is slow. Chloroform does not significantly bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} of {{waste water treatment}} plants (WWTPs) that have been tested output more PFOA than is input, and this increased output {{has been attributed to}} the <b>biodegradation</b> of fluorotelomer alcohols. A current PFOA precursor concern are fluorotelomer-based polymers; fluorotelomer alcohols attached to hydrocarbon backbones via ester linkages may detach and be free to biodegrade to PFOA.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biodegradation</b> {{can be seen}} in {{some studies}} that <b>biodegradation</b> {{accounts}} for the absence of creosote preservatives on the initial surface of the sediment. In a study from Pensacola, Florida, PAHs were not detected on the surface on the aquatic sediment, but the highest concentrations were detected at a depth of 8-13 centimeters. A form an anaerobic <b>biodegradation</b> of m-cresol was seen in a study using sulfate-reducing and nitrate-reducing enriched environments. The reduction of m-cresol in this study was seen in under 144 hours, while additional chemical intermediates were being formed. The chemical intermediates were formed in the presence of bicarbonate. The products included 4-hydroxy-2-methylbenzoic acid and acetate compounds. Although the conditions were enriched with the reducing anaerobic compounds, sulfate and nitrate reducing bacteria are commonly found in the environment. For further information, see sulfate-reducing bacteria. The type of anaerobic bacteria ultimately determines the reduction of the creosote preservative compounds, while each individual compound may only go through reduction under certain conditions. BTEX is a mixture of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, that was studied in the presence of four different anaerobic-enriched sediments. Though the compound, BTEX, is not found in creosote preservatives, the products of creosote preservatives' oxidation-reduction reactions include some of these compounds. For oxidation-reduction reactions, see the following section. In this study, it was seen that certain compounds such as benzene were only reduced under sulfate-enriched environments, while toluene was reduced under a variety of bacteria-enriched environments, not just sulfate. The <b>biodegradation</b> of a creosote preservative in an anaerobic enrichment depends not only on the type of bacteria enriching the environment, but also the compound that has been released from the preservative. In aerobic environments, preservative compounds are limited in the <b>biodegradation</b> process by the presence of free oxygen. In an aerobic environment, free oxygen comes from oxygen saturated sediments, sources of precipitation, and plume edges. The free oxygen allows for the compounds to be oxidized and decomposed into new intermediate compounds. Studies have shown that when BTEX and PAH compounds were placed in aerobic environments, the oxidation of the ring structures caused cleavage in the aromatic ring and allowed for other functional groups to attach. When an aromatic hydrocarbon was introduced to the molecular oxygen in experimental conditions, a dihydrodiol intermediate was formed, and then oxidation occurred transforming the aromatic into a catechol compound. Catechol allows for cleavage of the aromatic ring to occur, where functional groups can then add in an ortho- or meta- position.|$|E
25|$|Methylglycinediacetic acid (MGDA) is {{produced}} from glycine. MGDA {{has a high}} rate of <b>biodegradation</b> >68%, but unlike many other chelating agents can degrade without the assistance of adapted bacteria. Additionally, unlike EDDS or IDS, MGDA can withstand higher temperatures while maintaining a high stability as well as the entire pH range. As a result, the chelating strength of MGDA is stronger than many commercial chelating agents.|$|E
25|$|Compared with {{synthetic}} biomaterials such as polyglycolides and polylactides, silk {{is obviously}} advantageous {{in some aspects}} in <b>biodegradation.</b> The acidic degraded products of polyglycolides and polylactides will decrease the pH of the ambient environment and thus adversely influence the metabolism of cells, which {{is not an issue}} for silk. In addition, silk materials can retain strength over a desired period from weeks to months as needed by mediating the content of beta sheets.|$|E
25|$|Some {{municipalities}} {{are using}} {{and others are}} investigating Indirect Potable Reuse (IPR) of reclaimed water. For example, reclaimed water may be pumped into (subsurface recharge) or percolated down to (surface recharge) groundwater aquifers, pumped out, treated again, and finally used as drinking water. This technique may also {{be referred to as}} groundwater recharging. This includes slow processes of further multiple purification steps via the layers of earth/sand (absorption) and microflora in the soil (<b>biodegradation).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrogen}} isotope {{composition of}} oil, gas and coal {{is an important}} geochemical tool to study the formation, storage, migration and many other processes. The hydrogen isotopic signal of fossil fuels results from both inheritance of source material and water as well as fractionations during hydrocarbon generation and subsequent alteration by processes such as isotopic exchange or <b>biodegradation.</b> When interpreting hydrogen isotopic data of sedimentary organic matter one must take all the processes that might have an isotope effect into consideration.|$|E
25|$|Oil spills {{penetrate}} {{into the}} structure of the plumage of birds and the fur of mammals, reducing its insulating ability, and making them more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less buoyant in the water. Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water (affecting evaporation and <b>biodegradation),</b> and the types of shorelines and beaches involved. Spills may take weeks, months or even years to clean up.|$|E
25|$|Interest in {{environmental}} safety has brought up concerns about biodegradability in aminopolycarboxylates such as EDTA. For example, under the 28-day EN ISO 7827 test Austrian paper and pulp industries must use chelating agents that have <b>biodegradation</b> levels over 70% or 80% (after 28 days). An {{increased interest in}} safety {{has led to the}} development and research of alternative chelating ligands which can still bind strongly to metal ions but also have a higher biodegradability and a lower content of nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|Molds cause <b>biodegradation</b> {{of natural}} materials, {{which can be}} {{unwanted}} when it becomes food spoilage or damage to property. They also play important roles in biotechnology and food science {{in the production of}} various foods, beverages, antibiotics, pharmaceuticals and enzymes. Some diseases of animals and humans can be caused by certain molds: disease may result from allergic sensitivity to mold spores, from growth of pathogenic molds within the body, or from the effects of ingested or inhaled toxic compounds (mycotoxins) produced by molds.|$|E
25|$|At {{various times}} in the {{geologic}} past, the Earth had dense forests in low-lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried underneath soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from <b>biodegradation</b> and oxidation, usually by mud or acidic water. This trapped the carbon in immense peat bogs that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. As coal contains mainly carbon, the conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called carbonization.|$|E
25|$|Compound {{heterozygosity}} ultimately {{explains the}} disease's variability, including the late-onset forms. The disease can potentially {{result from the}} inheritance of two unrelated mutations in the HEXA gene, one from each parent. Classic infantile Tay–Sachs disease results when a child has inherited mutations from both parents that completely stop the <b>biodegradation</b> of gangliosides. Late onset forms occur due to the diverse mutation basenbsp&– people with Tay–Sachs disease may technically be heterozygotes, with two differing HEXA mutations that both inactivate, alter, or inhibit enzyme activity. When a patient {{has at least one}} HEXA copy that still enables some level of hexosaminidasenbsp&A activity, a later onset disease form occurs. When disease occurs because of two unrelated mutations, the patient {{is said to be a}} compound heterozygote.|$|E
25|$|DDT is a {{persistent}} organic pollutant that is readily adsorbed to soils and sediments, which can act both as sinks and as long-term sources of exposure affecting organisms. Depending on conditions, its soil half-life can range from 22 days to 30 years. Routes of loss and degradation include runoff, volatilization, photolysis and aerobic and anaerobic <b>biodegradation.</b> Due to hydrophobic properties, in aquatic ecosystems DDT and its metabolites are absorbed by aquatic organisms and adsorbed on suspended particles, leaving little DDT dissolved in the water. Its breakdown products and metabolites, DDE and DDD, are also persistent and have similar chemical and physical properties. DDT and its breakdown products are transported from warmer areas to the Arctic by the phenomenon of global distillation, where they then accumulate in the region's food web.|$|E
25|$|Inclusions of {{different}} sorts mixed with soil {{have been used}} for thousands of years. They were used in roadway construction in Roman days to stabilize roadways and their edges. These early attempts were made of natural fibres, fabrics or vegetation mixed with soil to improve road quality, particularly when roads were built on unstable soil. They were also used to build steep slopes as with several pyramids in Egypt and walls as well. A fundamental problem with using natural materials (wood, cotton, etc.) in a buried environment is the <b>biodegradation</b> that occurs from microorganisms in the soil. With the advent of polymers {{in the middle of the}} 20th century a much more stable material became available. When properly formulated, lifetimes of centuries can be predicted even for harsh environmental conditions.|$|E
25|$|Degree of {{acetylation}} (DA) for soluble chitosan {{ranges from}} 0% to 60%, depending on processing conditions. A {{study was conducted}} to characterize how varying DA affects the properties of chitosan. Varying DA was obtained using acetic anhydride or alkaline hydrolysis. It was found that decreasing acetylation created an increase in compressive strength. <b>Biodegradation</b> was examined by use of lysozyme, which is known to be mainly responsible for degrading chitosan in vivo by hydrolyzing its glycosidic bonds and is released by phagocytic cells after nerve injury. The results reveal that there was an accelerated mass loss with intermediate DAs, compared with high and low DAs over the time period studied. When DRG cells were grown on the N-acetylated chitosan, cell viability decreased with increasing DA. Also, chitosan has an increasing charge density with decreasing DA, which is responsible for greater cell adhesion. Thus, controlling the DA of chitosan is important for regulating the degradation time. This knowledge could help {{in the development of a}} nerve guidance conduit from chitosan.|$|E
25|$|Biocompatibility, i.e., {{the ability}} to what level the silk will cause an immune response, is {{definitely}} a critical issue for biomaterials. The biocompatibility of silk arose during its increasing clinical use. Indeed, wax or silicone is usually used as a coating to avoid fraying and potential immune responses when silk fibers serve as suture materials. Although the lack of detailed characterization of silk fibers, such as {{the extent of the}} removal of sericin, the surface chemical properties of coating material, and the process used, make it difficult to determine the real immune response of silk fibers in literature, it is generally believed that sericin is the major cause of immune response. Thus, the removal of sericin is an essential step to assure biocompatibility in biomaterial applications of silk. However, further research fails to prove clearly the contribution of sericin to inflammatory responses based on isolated sericin and sericin based biomaterials. In addition, silk fibroin exhibits an inflammatory response similar to that of tissue culture plastic in vitro when assessed with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) or lower than collagen and PLA when implant rat MSCs with silk fibroin films in vivo. Thus, appropriate degumming and sterilization will assure the biocompatibility of silk fibroin, which is further validated by in vivo experiments on rats and pigs. There are still concerns about the long-term safety of silk-based biomaterials in the human body in contrast to these promising results. Even though silk sutures serve well, they exist and interact within a limited period depending on the recovery of wounds (several weeks), much shorter than that in tissue engineering. Another concern arises from <b>biodegradation</b> because the biocompatibility of silk fibroin does not necessarily assure the biocompatibility of the decomposed products. In fact, different levels of immune responses and diseases have been triggered by the degraded products of silk fibroin.|$|E
500|$|Oil shale {{differs from}} bitumen-impregnated rocks (oil sands and {{petroleum}} reservoir rocks), humic coals and carbonaceous shale. [...] While oil sands do originate from the <b>biodegradation</b> of oil, heat and pressure have not (yet) transformed the kerogen in oil shale into petroleum, {{that means that}} its maturation does not exceed early mesocatagenetic.|$|E
500|$|Ethylene glycol {{involved}} in aircraft de-icing and anti-icing operations is released onto land {{and eventually to}} waterways. A report prepared for the World Health Organization in 2000 stated that laboratory tests exposing aquatic organisms to stream water receiving runoff from airports have shown toxic effects and death (p.12). Field studies {{in the vicinity of}} an airport have reported toxic signs consistent with ethylene glycol poisoning, fish kills, and reduced biodiversity, although those effects could not definitively be ascribed to ethylene glycol (p.12). The process of biodegrading of glycols also increases the risk to organisms, as oxygen levels become depleted in surface waters (p.13). Another study found the toxicity to aquatic and other organisms was relatively low, but the oxygen-depletion effect of <b>biodegradation</b> was more serious (p.245). Further, [...] "Anaerobic <b>biodegradation</b> may also release relatively toxic byproducts such as acetaldehyde, ethanol, acetate, and methane (p. 245)." ...|$|E
500|$|Composting, the {{purposeful}} <b>biodegradation</b> {{of organic}} matter by microorganisms, [...] {{is among the most}} simple ways of treating food waste and thereby preventing it being sent to landfill. Since all biodegradable materials will eventually oxidise to become compost, the process can be undertaken at home with no running costs, although equipment can accelerate the process. Most components of food waste are putrescibles and will be broken down in a compost, however some exceptions will not (e.g. cooked foods and feces) and can attract vermin. The effectiveness of composting food waste depends on the available space (or storage capacity {{in the case of a}} compost bin) and the method of composting. Unlike in landfill, where it is mixed with other (non-biodegradable) materials, food waste decomposing in a compost does not release harmful gases. Similarly to compost created from other waste sources, composted food waste can be used to return nutrients to the soil if spread on the garden (see uses of compost).|$|E
2500|$|As a {{structural}} isomer of EDTA, ethylenediamine-N,N′-disuccinic acid can exist as three isomers: (S,S), (R,S)/(S,R) and (R,R), {{but only the}} S,S-isomer is readily biodegradable. EDDS exhibits a surprisingly high rate <b>biodegradation</b> at 83% in 20 days. <b>Biodegradation</b> rates also varies the different metal ions chelated. For example, the complexes of lead and zinc with EDDS have relatively the same stability but the lead complex is biodegrades more efficiently than the zinc complex. [...] As of 2002, EDDS has been commercially prominent in Europe {{on a large scale}} with an estimated demand rate increase of about 15% each year.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is usually}} {{obtained}} as {{a mixture of}} the geometric isomers, called Z-1,3-dichloropropene, and E-1,3-dichloropropene. [...] Although it was first applied in agriculture in the 1950s, at least two <b>biodegradation</b> pathways have evolved. [...] One pathway degrades the chlorocarbon to acetaldehyde via chloroacrylic acid.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{such changes}} are {{frequently}} undesirable, in some cases, such as <b>biodegradation</b> and recycling, {{they may be}} intended to prevent environmental pollution. [...] Degradation can also be useful in biomedical settings. For example, a copolymer of polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid is employed in hydrolysable stitches that slowly degrade after they are applied to a wound.|$|E
2500|$|... n-Butanol is of low {{toxicity}} to aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates. It is rapidly biodegraded in water, although an estimated 83% partitions to air {{where it is}} degraded by hydroxyl radicals with a half-life of 1.2–2.3days. It has low potential to bioaccumulate. A potential hazard of significant discharges to watercourses is the rise in chemical oxygen demand (C.O.D.) associated with its <b>biodegradation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} goal of environmental chemistry is tracing {{the source and}} degradation of pollutants. [...] Various methods have been employed for fingerprinting pools of environmental pollutants such as the bulk chemical composition of a spill, isotope ratios of the bulk chemical mixture, or isotope ratios of individual constituent compounds. [...] Stable isotopes of carbon and hydrogen {{can be used as}} complimentary fingerprinting techniques for natural gas. [...] Recently, the D/H ratio of hydrocarbons from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was used to verify that their origin was likely from the Macondo well. [...] Hydrogen isotope ratios have also been used as a measure of the relative amount of <b>biodegradation</b> that has occurred in oil reservoirs in China, and studies on pure cultures of n-alkane degrading organisms have shown a chain-length dependence on the amount of hydrogen isotope fractionation during degradation. [...] Additional studies have also shown hydrogen isotope effects in the degradation of Methyl tert-butyl ether and Toluene that have been suggested to be useful in the evaluation of the level of degradation of these polluting compounds in the environment. [...] In both cases the residual unreacted compounds became enriched in deuterium to a few tens of per mil, with variations exhibited between different organisms and degree of reaction completeness. [...] These observations of heavy residual compounds have been applied to field observations of <b>biodegradation</b> reactions such as the removal of benzene and ethylbenzene, which imparted a D/H fractionation of 27 and 50 per mil, respectively. [...] Additionally analysis of o-xylene in a polluted site showed high residual D/H ratios after <b>biodegradation,</b> consistent with activation of C-H bonds being a rate limiting step in this process ...|$|E
