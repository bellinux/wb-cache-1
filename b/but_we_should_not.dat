25|$|Catherine Hills {{suggests}} {{it is not}} necessary to see all the early settlers as federate troops, and that this interpretation has been used rather too readily by some archaeologists. A variety of relationships could have existed between Romano-British and incoming Anglo-Saxons. The broader archaeological picture suggests that no one model will explain all the Anglo-Saxon settlements in Britain and that there was considerable regional variation. Settlement density varied within southern and eastern England. Norfolk has more large Anglo-Saxon cemeteries than the neighbouring East Anglian county of Suffolk; eastern Yorkshire (the nucleus of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Deira) far more than the rest of Northumbria. The settlers were not all of the same type. Some were indeed warriors who were buried equipped with their weapons, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> assume that all of these were invited guests who were to guard Romano-British communities. Possibly some, like the later Viking settlers, may have begun as piratical raiders who later seized land and made permanent settlements. Other settlers seem to have been much humbler people who had few if any weapons and suffered from malnutrition. These were characterised by Sonia Chadwick Hawkes as Germanic 'boat people', refugees from crowded settlements on the North Sea which deteriorating climatic conditions would have made untenable.|$|E

We {{would not want to}} be without his prefaces, of course, nor any other that he made about the origins of his music; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> follow them slavishly, {{for the simple reason that}} the symphonic poems do not follow them slavishly either." [...] Hugh MacDonald concurs that Liszt [...] "held an idealized view of the symphonic poem" [...] as being evocative rather than representational. [...] "He only rarely achieved in his symphonic poems the directness and subtle timing that narrative requires," [...] MacDonald explains; he generally focused more on expressing poetic ideas by setting a mood or atmosphere, refraining on the whole from narrative description or pictorial realism.|$|E

We also should keep weapons of unusual lethality from being on the street. And finally, we should go after people who use guns in the commission of crimes or illegally, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> interfere with the right of law-abiding citizens to own guns either for their own personal protection or hunting or any other lawful purpose." [...] He also said that, had it come before him as president, he would have signed a renewal of the federal assault weapons ban that had expired. The following month, during a presidential primary debate, he noted that the federal assault weapons ban that he would have signed as president had failed in Congress, and he insisted that he would not support any new gun control legislation: [...] "I do not believe we need new legislation. I do not support any new legislation of an assault weapon ban nature, including that against semiautomatic weapons. I instead believe that we have laws in place that if they're implemented and enforced, will provide the protection and the safety of the American people." ...|$|E

The difficulties of reconciling the characteristics of being intrinsic {{and at the same time}} essentially related are illustrated in this paper and it is argued that the reasons for thinking of powers as essentially relational are based on misguided epistemological consideration.

Surely, the insult turns to honor, and the wide grave needs no monument but the heroism that consecrates it in our sight; surely, the hearts that held him nearest see through their tears a noble victory in the seeming sad defeat; and surely, God's benediction was bestowed, when this loyal soul answered, as Death called the roll, [...] "Lord, here I am, with the brothers Thou hast given me!" ...|$|E
