40|$|Major League Baseball, {{alone among}} {{industries}} {{of its size}} in the United States, operates as an unregulated monopoly. This twentieth century regulatory anomaly has become known simply as the 2 ̆ 2 baseball anomaly. 2 ̆ 2 Major League Baseball developed into a major commercial enterprise without being subject to antitrust liability. Long after the interstate commercial character of baseball had been established, and even recognized by the Supreme Court, baseball 2 ̆ 7 s monopoly remained free from federal regulation. ^ This study explains the baseball anomaly by connecting baseball 2 ̆ 7 s regulatory status to the larger political environment, tracing the game 2 ̆ 7 s fate through four different regulatory regimes in the United States. The constellation of institutional, ideological and political factors within each regulatory regime provides the context for {{the persistence of the}} baseball anomaly. Baseball 2 ̆ 7 s unregulated monopoly persists because of the confluence of institutional, ideological and political factors which have prevented the repeal of baseball 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> antitrust <b>exemption</b> to date. However, both the institutional and ideological factors, which have in the past protected baseball 2 ̆ 7 s unregulated monopoly, are fading. Baseball 2 ̆ 7 s owners can no longer claim special cultural significance in defense of the exemption, nor can they claim that the commissioner system approximates government regulation sufficiently. Both of these strategies have been discredited by the labor unrest in baseball over the last decade. ^ While baseball is one labor strike away from losing part of its exemption, it will likely retain the aspects of the exemption which cover the contractual relationship between the major and minor leagues, as well as the part of the exemption which allows Major League Baseball to regulate the migration of individual franchises. These aspects of baseball 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>exemption</b> with likely be codified and expanded to all professional sports leagues. The eventual partial repeal of baseball 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>exemption</b> and the likely expansion of part of baseball 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>exemption</b> to other sports makes it both an outdated anomaly and a harbinger of sports antitrust policy in the twenty first century. ...|$|R

40|$|The Presidential Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform and the Joint Committee on Taxation {{staff have}} {{recently}} advanced similar proposals for a U. <b>S.</b> <b>exemption</b> system regarding particular foreign-source income of particular U.

40|$|Indirect fitness {{benefits}} from kin selection can explain why non-breeding individuals help raise the young of relatives. However, {{the evolution of}} helping by non-relatives requires direct fitness benefits, for example via group augmentation. Here, we examine nest visit rates, load sizes and prey types delivered by breeding pairs and their helpers in the cooperatively breeding bell miner (Manorina melanophrys). In this system, males remain in their natal colony while young females typically disperse, and helpers of both sexes often assist at multiple nests concurrently. We found extremely clear evidence for the expected effect of genetic relatedness on individual helping effort per nest within colonies. This positive incremental effect of kinship was facultative-i. e. largely the result of within-individual variation in helping effort. Surprisingly, no sex differences were detectable in any aspect of helping, and even non-relatives provided substantial aid. Helpers and <b>breeder!</b> <b>s</b> of both sexes regulated their provisioning effort by responding visit-by-visit to changes in nestling begging. Helping behaviour in bell miners therefore appears consistent with adaptive cooperative investment in the brood, and kin-selected care by relatives. Similar investment by 'unrelated' helpers of both sexes argues against direct fitness benefits, but is perhaps explained by kin selection at the colony level. ...|$|R

As a result, if one spouse dies without having used the exemption, it disappears, and the surviving spouse cannot use the deceased spouse 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>exemption.</b> While portability legislation has been proposed, Congress {{has failed to}} act thus far. Without portability legislation, estate planning has been difficult for {{a significant number of}} married couples who have what some may describe as intermediate-level wealth. In a series of four private letter rulings, the Internal Revenue Service (Service) has responded sympathetically, creating in effect an administrative solution to the portability problem. The difficulty, however, is that taxpayers are unable to rely on such rulings. In the absence of published guidance, the Service may decide to change its position and then apply a new standard to taxpayers who have utilized the previously approved drafting blueprint without having secured their own ruling. This uncertainty is particularly problematic because, as will be explained, the Service 2 ̆ 7 s analysis in these rulings may be incorrect. Indeed, incorporating the analysis in published guidance could undermine the Service 2 ̆ 7 s enforcement of the Code in unrelated contexts. In this Article, we suggest a new approach. Under this approach, taxpayers would be able to navigate the portability problem, and the Service would not weaken unrelated Code provisions. In Parts II and III, we explain the portability problem and the Service 2 ̆ 7 s solution to it. In Part IV, we explore the Service 2 ̆ 7 s private letter rulings and critique the Service 2 ̆ 7 s analysis. In Part V, we present an alternative solution for the portability problem.
