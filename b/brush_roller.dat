50|$|In 16th-century Europe, oil {{painting}} on canvas arose as an easier method for mural painting. The advantage {{was that the}} artwork could be completed in the artist's studio and later transported to its destination and there attached to the wall or ceiling. Oil paint may be a less satisfactory medium for murals because of its lack of brilliance in colour. Also the pigments are yellowed by the binder or are more easily affected by atmospheric conditions. The canvas itself is more subject to rapid deterioration than a plaster ground.Different muralists tend to become experts in their preferred medium and application, whether that be oil paints, emulsion or acrylic paints applied by <b>brush,</b> <b>roller</b> or airbrush/aerosols. Clients will often ask for a particular style and the artist may adjust to the appropriate technique.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{patented}} {{technical features}} that allowed effective cleaning {{of all kinds}} of carpets and bare floors, plus the ability to clean in the tightest corners, the 350, which indicated that the brush vibrator bar was 35 cm, was sold and used in hotels, hospitals and offices. With the addition of features like a clutch-protected <b>brush</b> <b>roller,</b> a by-pass motor and hospital-grade filtration, the first SEBO found acceptance in the market by 1979. Commercial cleaning manufacturers such as Windsor Kärcher and Jeyes Hygiene re-branded SEBO uprights under their own name during the early 1980s. In 1986, the SEBO 360 was launched to replace the 350. The 360 had a simple, electronic surface height adjustment feature that would automatically raise or lower the suction nozzle based on different cleaning surfaces. It would also notify if there was a brush obstruction or if the disposable filter bag was full.|$|E

5000|$|The SCS process feeds {{hot rolled}} sheet steel, either as {{individual}} blanks or as a continuous strip that is uncoiled, into the SCS [...] "brushing machine". Within the machine the steel is passed between sets of rotating <b>roller</b> <b>brushes</b> that spin on an axis perpendicular to the sheet's direction of travel. The <b>roller</b> <b>brush</b> exterior is an engineered abrasive, similar to Scotchbrite, that makes contact with the steel under pressure. Each <b>roller</b> <b>brush</b> spins against the steel at a speed of 900 to 1000 revolutions per minute, [...] "scrubbing away" [...] the outer layers of mill scale - hematite and magnetite - {{and most of the}} inner layer, wustite. The remaining wustite layer is only a few micrometres thick and highly polished to a smooth surface. Three such <b>roller</b> <b>brushes</b> are typically applied to each surface of the steel sheet, for a total of six <b>roller</b> <b>brushes</b> per SCS brushing machine. Numerous spray nozzles within the brushing machine provide water to rinse the removed scale and any other debris from the steel surface and to cool the friction heat generated in the brushes. The water is filtered and re-used in this closed-loop rinsing/filtering system.|$|R

The result show that a minute alteration of the central offset causes effect change of the load. This result provides a theoretical basis to control the effect change and then improve the stability and decrease the cost...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} series of studies relating to pad-wafer and brush-wafer contact characterization in planarization and post-planarization processes. These are also evaluated with the purposes of minimizing environmental impact and reducting cost of ownership. Firstly, a new method using spectral analysis based on real-time raw friction data is developed to quantify the total amount of mechanical interaction in the brush-fluid-wafer interface in terms of stick-slip phenomena in post-planarization scrubbing. This new method is remarkable from the standpoint of its potential to eliminate having to perform a multitude of experiments needed for constructing and interpreting Stribeck curves, and its application to processes where Stribeck curves fail to yield any useful data. Moreover, this method is applied to investigate the effect of <b>brush</b> <b>roller</b> design on scrubbing process and to analyze behaviors of eccentric brushes. In order to study pad-wafer contact in planarization processes, a mechanical characterization method (incremental loading test) is developed and applied to analyze different types of pads and pad surfaces subjected to various treatments. Along with optical interferometry and theoretical analysis, flow resistance due to pad land area topography can be estimated. The greatest contribution of this dissertation involves development of real pad-wafer contact area measurement technique using confocal microscopy. The real pad-wafer contact area is a difficult property to measure in planarization, yet it is a key feature to further understand the process. A custom-made sample holder with a sapphire window and a miniature load cell is used to collect confocal images at controlled values of down force. At last, the two newly developed techniques (incremental loading test and real pad-wafer contact area measurement using confocal microscopy) together with dual emission UV enhanced fluorescence imaging are utilized to investigate conditioning effects in planarization process...|$|E
40|$|The Pegasus Coating Removal System (PCRS) was {{demonstrated}} at Florida International University (FIU) {{where it was}} being evaluated for efficiency and cost. In conjunction with the FIU testing demonstration, a human factors assessment was conducted to assess the hazards and associated safety and health issues of concern for workers utilizing this technology. The PCRS is a chemical paste that {{is applied to the}} surface using a <b>brush,</b> <b>roller,</b> or airless sprayer. After the type of PCRS, thickness, and dwell time have been determined, a laminated backed material is placed on top of the chemical paste to slow down the drying process and to provide a mechanism to strip-off the chemical. After the dwell time is reached, the chemical substrate can be removed. Scrapers may be used to break-loose the layers as necessary or to break-loose the layers that are not removed when the laminated paper is picked up. Residue may also be cleaned off of the surface with a damp sponge with an agitating motion, absorbent sponges, or a vacuum, as needed. The paint and removal agent is then placed in drums for disposal at a later time. During the assessment sampling was conducted for organic vapors and general observational techniques were conducted for ergonomics. Recommendations for improved worker safety and health during application and removal of the PCRS include: (1) work practices that reflect avoidance of exposure or reducing the risk of exposure; (2) assuring all PPE and equipment are compatible with the chemicals being used; (3) work practices that reduce the worker`s need to walk on the slippery surface caused by the chemical or the use of special anti-slip soles; (4) careful control of overspray (if a spray application is used); and (5) the use of ergonomically designed long-handled tools to apply and remove the chemical (to alleviate some of the ergonomic concerns) ...|$|E
