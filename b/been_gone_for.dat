25|$|After more staff turnover, McTavish again {{returned}} as head writer. Her storylines began airing in July 2003, {{which included the}} controversial rape of Bianca. Gone upon McTavish's latest return was Jean Dadario Burke as executive producer, being replaced with Julie Hanan Carruthers. Under McTavish, ratings fluctuated back and forth. To lure back long-time viewers, McTavish created new characters and romances, as well as scripted the return of various characters who had <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> long. She introduced star-crossed couple JR Chandler and Babe Carey upon writing JR's return to the series, scripted most of popular pairing Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone's love story, and created fellow popular couple Zach Slater and Kendall Hart. Characters Julia Santos (Sydney Penny) and Janet Dillon (Kate Collins, who was originally slated to return for a brief stint) were eventually brought back.|$|E
500|$|The {{synopsis}} for {{the episode}} reads [...] "Sherlock has <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> two years. But someone isn't quite convinced that he's dead." [...] The 'someone' {{turns out to}} be Anderson, the forensics technician from series 1 and 2 (who has now lost his job due to his obsessive conviction that the detective still lives). He had a long-standing mistrust of Sherlock, yet {{is now one of the}} few people who believes Sherlock is alive, and throughout the episode is trying to convince Lestrade. Anderson tracks him via various mysterious events from Tibet to New Delhi to Germany in which he seems to be involved and points out that the incidents are getting progressively closer to London.|$|E
500|$|Rodriguez {{first came}} up with the idea for Planet Terror during the {{production}} of The Faculty: [...] "I remember telling Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett, all these young actors, that zombie movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, but that I thought they were going to come back in a big way because they’d <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> so long. I said, 'We've got to be there first.' I had [...] I’d started writing. It was about 30 pages, and I said to them, 'There are characters for all of you to play.' We got all excited about it, and then I didn't know where to go with it. The introduction was about as far as I'd gotten, and then I got onto other movies. Sure enough, the zombie [...] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've made my zombie film.'" [...] The story was reapproached when Tarantino and Rodriguez developed the idea for Grindhouse.|$|E

500|$|Scott Shetler of Pop Crush {{described}} the song as a [...] "forceful rock track that reminds fans why {{the group was}} one of the most successful crossover acts of the past decade" [...] and praised Lee's [...] "strong-but-pretty vocals". James Montgomery from MTV News, praised the song saying that the [...] "elastic-yet-lock-step energy not only makes the song the perfect comeback single for a band that's <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> far too long, but it manages to capture the very essence of what inspired them to press on." [...] Tom Goodwyn of the same publication wrote: [...] "A big thumping drumbeat and driving guitar riff kick things off, before giving way to a stomping chorus written with NFL stadiums in mind." [...] Karen Bliss of the magazine Rolling Stone praised Lee's [...] "haunting" [...] and [...] "crystalline" [...] vocals in the [...] "industrial-strength sound" [...] of [...] "What You Want". Nick Catucci of the same publication gave the song three stars writing, [...] "Amy Lee trades anguish for defiance, goosing her wail with welcome sass. Still, she's nearly overrun by the music, a collision of two-ton guitars, strings and piano." [...] Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club wrote: [...] "Lee really can sing, and the opener 'What You Want' shows she has the pipes (and even the submerged spunk) to become the new Pat Benatar this generation desperately needs." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave the song five out of five stars praising the hook as one of the best in the band's career adding that it managed to make the song [...] "instantly unforgettable". Florino further called the song [...] "another classic from Evanescence" [...] which will [...] "revive rock music again" [...] and concluded: ...|$|E
2500|$|Set in Tulsa, Oklahoma, {{the film}} begins in a diner called Bennys Billiards, where local tough guy Rusty James is told by Midget that rival group leader Biff Wilcox {{wants to meet}} him that night in an {{abandoned}} garage lot for a fight. Accepting the challenge, Rusty James then talks with his friends— the wily Smokey, loyal B.J., and nerdy Steve - who all have a different take on the forthcoming fight. Steve mentions that Rusty James' older brother, [...] "The Motorcycle Boy," [...] would not be pleased with the fight as he had previously created a truce forbidding gang fights, or [...] "rumbles." [...] Rusty James dismisses him, saying that Motorcycle Boy (whose real name is never revealed) has <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> two months, leaving without explanation or promise of return.|$|E
2500|$|While hitchhiking {{through the}} galaxy, Arthur Dent is dropped {{off on a}} planet in a rainstorm. He {{appears to be in}} England on Earth, even though he saw the planet {{destroyed}} by the Vogons. He has <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> several years, but only a few months have passed on Earth. He hitches a lift with a man named Russell and his sister Fenchurch (nicknamed [...] "Fenny"). Russell explains that Fenny became delusional after worldwide mass hysteria, in which everyone hallucinated [...] "big yellow spaceships" [...] (the Vogon destructor ships that [...] "demolished" [...] the Earth). Arthur becomes curious about Fenchurch, but they reach his home before he can ask more questions. Inside his still standing home, Arthur finds a gift-wrapped bowl inscribed with the words [...] "So long and thanks", which he uses for his Babel Fish.

2500|$|The {{report also}} criticized the {{district}} information systems personnel. [...] The district's top technology administrator since July 2009, George Frazier, {{told investigators that}} he considered the systems department the [...] "Wild West", [...] "because there were few official policies, and no manuals of procedures, and personnel were not regularly evaluated." [...] The report said former information systems Director DiMedio and her staffers [...] "were not forthcoming" [...] about the tracking technology; DiMedio {{declined to be interviewed}} unless the district reimbursed her for the cost of her retaining an attorney, which the district declined to do. [...] DiMedio's lawyer criticized the report for faulting DiMedio's role in the district's use of web cameras. [...] He criticized the cover-page description of the investigators' work as an [...] "independent" [...] probe, saying: [...] "It was not an independent investigation. What flows from that [...] is a clear attempt to insulate and protect the current [...] board {{at the expense of the}} IT [...] department and employees like Ginny … to throw her under the bus." [...] He said DiMedio never hid the software's tracking features from administrators or board members. [...] He also noted that DiMedio had <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> months when the assistant principal confronted Robbins with the photo taken by his laptop webcam in his [...] home.|$|E
2500|$|Dana {{managed to}} wash off the filth {{from the river}} before the {{dizziness}} sets in once again. This time, she is whisked back to a bedroom where a red-haired boy has set his bedroom drapes aflame. The boy {{turns out to be}} Rufus, now a few years older. Dana quickly puts out the fire and speaks to Rufus, who, unafraid, confesses he set fire to the drapes to get back at his father for beating him after he stole a dollar. During their ensuing conversation, Rufus's casual use of the word [...] "nigger" [...] to refer to Dana, who is black, initially upsets Dana, but then leads her to figure out that she has been transported back in time as well as space, specifically to Maryland, circa 1815. Following Rufus's advice, Dana seeks refuge at home of Alice Greenwood and her mother, free blacks who live {{on the edge of the}} plantation. Dana realizes that both Rufus and Alice are her ancestors, and will one day have children. At the Greenwoods', she witnesses a group of young white men smash down the door, drag out Alice’s father, who is a slave, and whip him brutally for being there without papers. One of the men punches Alice's mother when she refuses his advances. The men leave, Dana comes out of hiding, and helps Alice’s mother, only to be confronted by one of the white men, who hits her and attempts to rape her. Fearing for her life, Dana becomes dizzy and returns to 1976. Though hours have passed for her, Kevin assures her that she has only <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> <b>for</b> a few minutes. The next day, Kevin and Dana prepare for the possibility that she may travel back in time again by packing her a survival bag and by doing some research on black history from the books in their home library.|$|E
