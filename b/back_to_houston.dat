25|$|In {{order to}} even out the franchises at 32, the league also {{contemplated}} adding another expansion franchise. As Houston {{was one of}} the favorites for the extra franchise along with Toronto and Los Angeles (which had lost the Rams and the Raiders in 1995), McNair then decided to join the football project and founded Houston NFL Holdings with partner Steve Patterson. In association with Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, they would push for a domed stadium as part of the bid to lure the NFL <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Houston.</b> On October 6, 1999 the NFL awarded the 32nd team to Houston, at the cost of $700 million.|$|E

500|$|In the {{following}} season, both Olajuwon and Sampson were {{named to the}} Western Conference All-Stars in that year's all-star game, and the duo was nicknamed the [...] "Twin Towers". Houston won the Midwest Division title with a 51–31 record. In contrast to the other guard-oriented teams of the Western Conference, the Rockets had a high rotation on the position – John Lucas left the team 65 games into the season, Allen Leavell replaced him for twelve games before breaking his wrist, and Robert Reid took over as the starter from {{the final game of}} the regular season on. During the playoffs, the Rockets swept the Sacramento Kings before a hard-fought series with Alex English's Denver Nuggets, including one game going to double overtime in the exhausting altitude of the Mile-High City. The young squad grinded it out and eventually pulled away with the victory over the Nuggets 4–2. [...] When faced with defending champion Lakers in the Conference Finals, the Rockets were ready to knock off their rivals who had the best of them during the regular season. The Rockets, however, were blown out of Game 1 with Olajuwon's spinning reverse dunks and Sampson's alley-oops notwithstanding. Embarrassed by the loss, Olajuwon and the Rockets stormed back to shock the star-studded defending champions with 4 straight wins in an impressive four games to one series victory, a feat that no other Western Conference team had come close to doing against the Showtime Lakers. Sampson's buzzer beater that won Game 5 was described by him as [...] "the greatest moment of my basketball career". The Rockets competed in the finals {{for only the second time}} in team history, once again facing the Celtics. Boston sportswriters were not happy about not getting a shot at revenge against the Lakers who had beaten the Celtics in the Finals the year before, yet the matchup was interesting with the young front court challenging the playoff-hardened Celtics front court of Bird, McHale and Parish. The Celtics won the first two games at the Boston Garden, only for the Rockets to win two games once the series went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Houston</b> – a close game 3 under Sampson's leadership, and a 15 point-leading game 5 without him as he got ejected – while also losing game 4 due to late Larry Bird 3 pointers and untimely turnovers by Rockets guard Mitchell Wiggins. Game 6 went back to Boston with Sampson finding himself again in foul trouble and of little effect against the older and wiser Celtics. [...] After the series, Boston coach KC Jones called the Rockets, [...] "the new monsters on the block" [...] with the future looking very bright for the Rockets. During the six-game championship series loss against the Celtics, Sampson averaged 14.8 points on [...]438 shooting, 9.5 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game.|$|E

2500|$|The University of Colorado at Boulder {{accepted}} Van Zandt as {{a student}} in 1962. In the spring of his second year, his parents flew to Boulder to bring Townes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Houston,</b> apparently worried about his binge drinking and episodes of depression. They admitted him to the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, where {{he was diagnosed with}} manic depression. He received three months of insulin shock therapy, which erased much of his long-term memory. Afterwards, his mother claimed her [...] "biggest regret in life was that she had allowed that treatment to occur". In 1965, he was accepted into the University of Houston's pre-law program. Soon after he attempted to join the Air Force, but was rejected due to a doctor's diagnosis that labelled him [...] "an acute manic-depressive who has made minimal adjustments to life". He quit school around 1967, having been inspired by his singer-songwriter heroes to pursue a career in playing music.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1965 five infill wells were sabotaged. The {{incident}} {{occurred during the}} reign of King Idris before the 1969 coup led by Colonel Qaddafi. The wild wells were not reported in the news media and the perpetrations not revealed. Until the Persian Gulf War of 1991 this was the largest simultaneous well fire ever. In recognition of the number and ferocity of the blowouts BP called for the fire fighter Red Adair plus his lieutenants Boots & Coots. On arrival the crew drove around the field to assess the task. One of the wells had not caught fire but was erupting crude. Living up to his larger than life reputation mirrored by John Wayne in the film Hellfighters Adair approached the well and closed the undamaged master valve saying (reputedly) [...] "one down four to go".

2500|$|Since {{leaving the}} White House, {{she and her}} husband reside in the River Oaks {{community}} in Houston, Texas and at the Bush compound in Kennebunkport, Maine. Bush described January 20, 1993, the day of Bill Clinton's inauguration, a [...] "tough day" [...] for her and George. After returning to Houston, the two were visited by their son George W. and at that point Barbara realized she had not cooked in twelve years, and had difficulty driving on her own to the point where she did not drive far from home {{for a long time and}} her husband warned people to get out of the way if they saw her car.

She checked in on January 12, and a program of intravenous feedings was begun to build her up for possible surgery. MacDonald died two days later on January 14 at 4:32 pm, with her husband at her bedside.
