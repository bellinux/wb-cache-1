5000|$|I have to {{say that}} the prose in this book often reads as if it were written, or maybe dictated, in a great hurry. There is some {{unnecessary}} repetition, and many paragraphs spend more time than they should on digressions that seem to have occurred to the author in mid-thought. If not exactly chiseled, the prose is nevertheless lively, readable, and plainspoken. The haste may have been justified by the pace of the events he aims to describe and explain.

5000|$|On November 14, 2002, at the World Bar inside Trump World Tower in New York, Trump {{unveiled}} {{plans to}} replace Trump Style {{with a new}} magazine {{to be known as}} Trump World. Jacobson expected to spend under $1 million to launch the new magazine, which would be published quarterly. A total of 50,000 copies would be offered to guests for free at Trump's country clubs, condominium properties, and hotel-casinos, while another 50,000 would be mailed to upper-class people. Trump, who would not be spending any money on the magazine, would still earn a portion of the profits. Trump said, [...] "I have editorial control, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> a tremendous lack of time. I'm not going to be checking commas. I'm not going to be very involved."

50|$|The {{heart of}} the {{dialogue}} opens with a challenge by Socrates to the elder and revered Parmenides and Zeno. Employing his customary method of attack, the reductio ad absurdum, Zeno has argued that if as the pluralists say things are many, then they will be both like and unlike; {{but this is an}} impossible situation, for unlike things cannot be like, nor like things unlike. But this difficulty vanishes, says Socrates, if we are prepared to make the distinction between sensibles on one hand and Forms, in which sensibles participate, on the other. Thus one and the same thing can be both like and unlike, or one and many, by participating in the Forms of Likeness and Unlikeness, of Unity and Plurality; I am one man, and as such partake of the Form of Unity, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> many parts and in this respect I partake of the Form of Plurality. There is no problem in demonstrating that sensible things may have opposite attributes; what would cause consternation, and earn the admiration of Socrates, would be if someone were to show that the Forms themselves were capable of admitting contrary predicates.|$|E
5000|$|Heavily {{inspired}} by Todd Rundgren's 1973 album A Wizard, a True Star, Lonerism represents {{somewhat of a}} musical departure for Tame Impala. Whilst making Innerspeaker, Parker {{felt the need to}} [...] "make an album that was comfortably audible, easily enjoyed, but still smart". However, for the second album, he said, [...] "I surrendered to temptation and desire to make an album that is really fucked up. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> a desire to sound like Britney Spears, I love pop music and bad plastics. On the one hand this album is weird and fucked up, {{but on the other hand}} it's very pop." [...] After the album was completed Parker later revealed that some of the more indulgent pop moments of the album were removed: [...] "Thankfully, those bits were culled from the final project. The big thing that was difficult to put a lid on was the excessiveness of really cheesy pop things. For whatever reason, I started to become obsessed with pop melodies and pop chord progressions. I fell in love with the disposable-ness of it. Maybe it was because we had suddenly become involved in this indie scene, and a part of my personality was trying to reject whatever environment I was in; we were in love with the idea that people would hate it. We just let ourselves go, doing these six-minute prog-pop pieces." [...] However, Parker said [...] "We still have them; we'll probably make them B-sides." ...|$|E
