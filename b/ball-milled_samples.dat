Then the samples were dissolved with 7 % NaOH/ 12 % urea solutions at ? 12 °C, followed by successive extractions with dioxane, ethanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The yields of the obtained cellulose rich fractions ranged from 75. 1 to 77. 7 %.

The Pb particles were synthesized with similar particle sizes, about 5 ± 30 nm in diameter, but were observed {{to have different}} Pb ± Al interfaces for samples preparedusing different approaches. In themelt-spun Pb ± Al samples, the Pb nanoparticles were seen to have an epitaxial relationship with the Al matrix, while the Pb particles in the <b>ball-milled</b> <b>sample</b> were seen to be randomly {{oriented with respect to}} the Al matrix. The melting behaviour of the Pb particles was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry.

We suggest that different interface structures, which cause variations in energy differences between solid-Pb ± solid-Al and liquid-Pb ± solid-Al interfaces, are responsible for the different melting behaviour of Pb nanoparticles. Although melting is ubiquitous in nature, the meltingmechanism is still an open question to scientists.
