Atomic force microscopy (AFM) {{was used to measure}} surface roughness, and peak-to-valley values were extracted from line scan data collected by Gwiddion software. Tilted scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken of the electrodes, which had been coated with a 10 -nm gold layer to prevent electron charging. To determine the level of adhesion, a piece of scotch tape was applied on the silver nanowire film, pressed with a finger, and then peeled off, with the {{sheet resistance}} of the electrode being measured before and after.

Polythiophene was synthesized via oxidative polymerization in chloroform at 40 °C.

We determined the GD/PEDOT:PSS composite effectively fills the dense micro-pores in the paper substrate, which leads to improved carrier transport in the electrode and a 3 -fold enhanced cell efficiency as compared to the paper electrode made with sputtered Pt. Moreover, the DSSC with the paper electrode featuring the GD/PEDOT:PSS composite did not fail in photovoltaic tests even after <b>bending</b> the <b>electrode</b> 150 times, whereas the device made with the Pt-based paper electrode decreased in efficiency by 45 % after such manipulation.

30|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{difference}} in the measured output voltage is argued to be {{the difference in the}} growth direction of the nanowires. The VLS method yielded nanowires that were not aligned but rather grew in random directions, compared to the aqueous solution method which yields vertically aligned nanowires. When the nanowires are <b>bend</b> by the <b>electrode</b> the piezoelectric charges are polarized in the longitudinal direction of the nanowire [26]. This means that the piezoelectric charge in vertically aligned nanowires will be higher when compared to unaligned nanowires. This is the case where the aqueous solution growth yield higher output voltages when compared to the VLS method.|$|R
30|$|The {{output voltage}} of the ZnO {{nanowire}} substrate {{is measured by}} placing a gold electrode {{on top of the}} nanowires, and a force is then applied to this electrode. The applied force results in the <b>electrode</b> <b>bending</b> the nanowires, which in turn creates a piezoelectric potential {{and as a result of}} the formation of a Schottky contact at the nanowire electrode interface, an output voltage is observed [16]. The applied force can be controlled by placing various weights on the electrode to ensure accurate measurements are taken. The resistance and the carrier concentration of the nanowire arrays are measured, using the Van der Pauw and Hall methods respectively [17, 18].|$|R

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case report. SETTING: Tertiary {{referral}} {{cochlear implant}} center. PATIENT: A 21 -year-old woman was implanted with Advanced Bionics HiFocus Clarion device without complication. Five years later, the patient presented with dizziness, fluctuating implant performance, and facial pain. INTERVENTION: Surgical exploration revealed a torn electrode silicon casing {{in conjunction with}} scar contraction <b>bending</b> the <b>electrode</b> against bony facial nerve canal at the facial recess. Suspension of the electrode such that the damaged portion was not in contact with mastoid cavity led to temporary resolution of symptoms. Explantation and reimplantation procedures were carried out 2 months later. RESULTS: Postexplantation device analysis by the manufacturer demonstrated silicone touch-up {{at the site of}} failure. Six years since reimplantation, the patient has remained symptom-free. It is very likely that the touch-up silicon weakened the electrode and, in conjunction with chronic scar contraction, led to the tear on the silicon casing. CONCLUSION: Isolated cochlear implant electrode failure is a rare but possible long-term complication in older generation devices.

The characterization is accomplished with the bending beam method (BBM) using thin (35 mm) Si cantilever electrodes.

40|$|Electrogastrography (EGG) is the {{recording}} of gastric electrical activity (GEA) from the body surface. The cutaneous signal is low in amplitude and consequently must be amplified considerably.

Consequently, EGG recordings require special methodology for acquisition, processing and analysis. Essential components of this methodology involve an adequate system of digital filtering, amplification and analysis, along with minimization {{of the sources of}} external noise (random motions of the patient, electrode-skin interface impedance, <b>electrode</b> <b>bending,</b> obesity, etc) and a quantitative interpretation of {{the recording}}s. There is a close relationship between GEA and gastric motility.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) is an {{invasive}} diagnostic pro-cedure in epilepsy {{surgery that}} is usually implemented with frame-based methods. OBJECTIVE: To describe a new technique of frameless SEEG and report a prospective case series at a single center. METHODS: Image integration and planning of electrode trajectories were performed preoperatively on specialized software and exported to a Medtronic S 7 StealthStation. Trajectories were implemented by frameless stereotaxy using percutaneous drilling and bolt insertion. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients went this technique, with the insertion of 187 intra-cerebral electrodes. Of 187 electrodes, 175 accurately reached their neurophysiological target, as measured by postoperative computed tomography reconstruction and multimodal image integration with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Four electrodes failed to hit their target due to extradural deflection, and 3 were sub-sequently resited satisfactorily. Eight electrodes were off target by a mean of 3. 6 mm (range, 0. 9 - 6. 8 mm) due {{to a combination of}} errors in bolt trajectory implementation and <b>bending</b> of the <b>electrode.</b> There was 1 postoperative hemorrhage that was clinically asymptomatic and no postoperative infections.

40|$|Conducting {{polymers}} show {{great promise}} as supercapacitor materials {{due to their}} high theoretical specific capacitance, low cost, toughness, and flexibility. Poor ion mobility, however, can render active material {{more than a few}} tens of nanometers from the surface inaccessible for charge storage, limiting performance. Here, we use semi-interpenetrating networks (sIPNs) of a pseudocapacitive polymer in an ionically conductive polymer matrix to decrease ion diffusion length scales and make virtually all of the active material accessible for charge storage. Our freestanding poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) /poly(ethylene oxide) (PEDOT/PEO) sIPN films yield simultaneous improvements in three crucial elements of supercapacitor performance: specific capacitance (182 F/g, a 70 % increase over that of neat PEDOT), cycling stability (97. 5 % capacitance retention after 3000 cycles), and flexibility (the <b>electrodes</b> <b>bend</b> to a < 200 μm radius of curvature without breaking).

40|$|Lumbar muscle {{activity}} {{assessment was}} useful {{in evaluating the}} muscle conditions of low back pain (LBP) patients. Among many assessment methods, surface electromyography (surface EMG) offered a non-invasive and objective alternative for muscle function studies. However there is no benchmark method for interpreting pathological significance of surface EMG. Surface EMG topography is a novel technique in visualizing and presenting myoelectric activities in lumbar muscle upon static and dynamic motions. Previous studies attempted to uncover the usefulness of topographic features, though quantitative analyses were few. The objective {{of this study was}} to realize the significance of topographic features with use of quantitative methods. Ten healthy male subjects were recruited for a control database for surface EMG topographic features. Surface EMG was recorded from the subjects in lumbar region during forward <b>bending</b> by an <b>electrode</b> array. Root mean square (RMS) values of myoelectric signals were calculated to construct topography representing lumbar myoelectric activities. Relative area (RA), relative width (RW), relative height (RH) and Width-to-Height Ratio (W/H) were chosen as the four quantitative parameters in measuring topographic features. The control data was compared against a LBP patient group of eight subjects to investigate the deviation in the four topographic parameters. RW and W/H in patient group were found significantly larger than normal group. The result of this study suggested a quantitative and objective approach in investigating lumbar myoelectric activities to realize LBP disorder and implied evaluation assessment for LBP rehabilitation. © 2009 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Four-megahertz {{radiowave}} {{surgery is}} a relatively new technology usage of which rapidly expands reaching superior results compared to other surgical techniques. Radiosurgery is an atraumatic metod of cutting and coagulation of soft tissues that uses optimal low heat 4. 0 MHz source for numerous plastic,esthetic and cosmetic interventions which reguires surgical precision, penetration control and low temperature. This technology allows us to simultaneously cut and coagulate the tissue with minimal lateral tissue alteration, without burning damage and with better wounds healing. This mode is used by the author in high vascularity anatomical areas and for the deeper tissue of the head and neck. The pure cutting wave-form is ideal for skin excision with otoplasty and blepharoplasty when we expect ideal esthetic result. Coagulation is obviously paramount for any surgeon and can make the difference between a good and poor result. When he coagulates tissues in the head and neck, the surgen is frequently close to significant structures such as nerves and vessels which we must protect. Ellman Sugitron 4. 0 offers great advantages. One of the stronges point of the Ellman system is the large array of specialized <b>electrodes.</b> By <b>bending</b> the malleable <b>electrodes</b> we can use them at any angle or even around corners. Material and Methods: The Author has done surgical procedures on over 600 patients using this technique on different esthetic problems with satisfying results. In operative material dominate various skin growths (hemangioma, fibroma, naevus, wart) blepharoplasy, otoplasty, rhinoplasty and other minor surgical procedures. Interventions were done in local anesthesy. The aim of this work is to present our observations about radioablation in heterogenous pathological process on head and neck based of our own experience. Results: Our results show that this technology have great advantage over other techniques (scalpel, electrocouter, laser) from which the most important are simultaneous cutting and coagulation,coagulation in liquid medium, minimal termal damage of latteral tissues, faster healing of wounds with excellent cosmetic results. If we want surgery without cut,cut without scar, Ellman Sugitron is the best choice...|$|R
40|$|The ISAC project under {{construction}} at TRIUMF[1] is {{to consist of}} radioactive ion sources, a high resolution mass separator, a low-energy (60 keV) experimental area, RFQ and DTL linacs to reach 1. 5 MeV per atomic mass unit (amu), and a high-energy experimental area. Additionally, {{there will be a}} stable off-line source primarily for commis-sioning the linacs but also for use by the low-energy exper-imental program. The transport line which connects these elements therefore includes a switch which allows either the radioactive beam to supply the low energy area simul-taneously with the off-line source supplying the RFQ, or the radioactive beam supplying beam to the RFQ simul-taneously with the off-line source supplying beam to the low-energy experiments. The maximum ion source voltage is 60 kV. The RFQ accepts particles with 2 keV per amu, so masses less than 30 must have lower energy and masses larger than 30 can only be accelerated if they are multiply-charged. All optics is electrostatic; the <b>bends</b> have spher-ical <b>electrodes.</b> Alignment tolerances are given. Aberra-tions are kept sufficiently small that the maximum beam emittance of 50 mm-mrad is transported with negligible distortion. Of particular interest are the achromatic bend sections, the sawtooth buncher insertion, and the matching section to the RFQ. 1 BEAM PROPERTIES For acceleration in the RFQ, particles must have a velocity corresponding to 2 keV per amu. The lightest mass con-sidered will be 6 amu; therefore the smallest momentum is B = 386 gauss-m. After considering variously reported emittances for ra-dioactive ion sources, we have chosen 50 mm-mrad as the upper limit nominal emittance. This means we desire to be able to transport this emittance easily with negligible degra-dation. In practical terms, this means that the acceptance of the transport system should be at least 200 mm-mrad. In some cases, the beam after the separator may have a much smaller emittance in the bend plane than in the non-bend plane. Somewhat arbitrarily, we impose the condition that for an emittance ratio of 25, the smaller emittance be allowed to increase by no more than 20 %. The intensity of the radioactive beam is not envisaged to exceed 1 A, so space charge is not important. ...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} limited speed and high power {{dissipation}} copper wires {{can no longer}} {{meet the demands of}} future high speed computing devices. While many different approaches are being tried to overcome the challenge, the one based on a high-speed optical link looks promising. By using photons to transfer information one is able to eliminate the bottlenecks associated with electronic based interconnects. Where optical alternatives usually suffer from high costs and a cost effective approach that is also capable of high volume production is required. In this regard, silicon photonics offers a solution due to its CMOS compatibility. Over the last decade remarkable {{progress has been made in}} the field of silicon photonics where photodetectors, optical sources (lasers) and modulators have been the focus of the study. The electro-optic modulator, which converts electrical signal into optical signal, is a fundamental building block of silicon photonics. Designers have previously concentrated more on optimizing the optical design of the modulator but the modulator’s bandwidth can significantly improve if its electrode design is optimized. The aim of the project was to optimize the modulator electrode to maximize the bandwidth performance of the electrode. Each element of the electrode has been studied separately. These include bends, tapers and two different dimensions of the coplanar line. Simulation results of square bend, mitred bend, round bend, exponential taper, Klopfenstein taper, triangular taper and two different dimensions of the coplanar line losses are presented. The fabrication process, analysis of aluminium surface morphology and etching techniques are discussed. As a result, characterization of different types of <b>bends,</b> tapers and <b>electrodes</b> are shown where discontinuities like bends and tapers reveal insignificant added loss between 0 GHz and 67 GHz. The final characterized electrode for a 0. 5 mm long modulator has a 3 dB point above 67 GHz whereas previous designs were limited to 42. 8 GHz. Since velocity mismatch between optical and electrical signals also limits the modulator’s performance, an effective technique to slow the electrical signal to match its velocity to that of the optical signal for slow wave modulators has successfully been demonstrated with the potential to achieve very high slowing down factors. The slow wave structure for electrode consisted of silicon dioxide and floating metal strips. The characterised slow wave modulator with slow wave electrode confirms a slowing down factor of 2. Not only will the slow wave structure slow down the electrical signal to reduce the mismatch with optical signal velocity, it will also reduce the substrate loss. This shows the potential of slow wave modulator bandwidth to double if optimized further...|$|R
