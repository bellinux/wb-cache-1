25|$|Andros Island is {{surrounded}} by thousands of square miles of fishable flats, home to permit, tarpon, and especially <b>bonefish.</b> The island {{is known as the}} <b>bonefish</b> capital of the world. <b>Bonefish</b> are considered among the world's premiere gamefish for anglers. Other varieties of fishing are available on Andros. Deep sea fishing beyond the reef in the Tongue of the Ocean offers dorado, tuna, sailfish, wahoo, and jacks. Locals fish regularly on the reef for abundant snapper and grouper.|$|E
25|$|Saltwater {{fly fishing}} {{is most often}} done from a boat, either a shallow draft flat boat is used to pursue species such as <b>bonefish,</b> redfish, permit and tarpon in shallow waters, or from larger {{offshore}} boats for pursuing sailfish, tuna, dorado, marlin and other pelagics and may be done from shore, such as wading flats for <b>bonefish</b> or redfish or surf fishing for striped bass and other assorted fish. Typically, most trout fly fisherman need to practice new skills to catch saltwater fish on a fly rod. Ocean fish are usually harder to catch. They can be extremely spooky, and much larger. Trout fisherman need to practice with at least an 8 weight fly rod and accurately cast the line 30–90 feet {{if they are going}} to have success—particularly in the flat areas fishing for <b>bonefish,</b> redfish, permit, tarpon, jacks and more.|$|E

50|$|The <b>bonefishes</b> are {{brackish}} or {{saltwater fish}} typically living in estuaries and travelling {{out to sea}} to spawn on a lunar cycle. They feed in the shallow sand and mud flats, on benthic organisms, such as worms, mollusks, shrimp and crabs. They use their conical-shaped snouts to root out their prey and can often be seen with their tails out of the water. <b>Bonefishes</b> possess crushing teeth in their palates.|$|R
25|$|Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) {{regularly}} nest {{in small}} numbers on Kiritimati. The lagoon is famous among sea anglers worldwide for its <b>bonefish</b> (Albula glossodonta), {{and has been}} stocked with Oreochromis tilapia to decrease overfishing of marine species. Though the tilapias thrive in brackish water of the flats, they will not last long should they escape into the surrounding ocean.|$|E
25|$|Hooks for {{saltwater}} flies {{must also}} be extremely durable and corrosion resistant. Most saltwater hooks are made of stainless steel, but the strongest (though less corrosion resistant) hooks are of high-carbon steel. Typically, these hooks vary from size #8 to #2 for <b>bonefish</b> and smaller nearshore species, to size #3/0 to #5/0 for the larger offshore species.|$|E

25|$|Abemama is {{an island}} of {{beautiful}} beaches with a crystal clear blue lagoon. In Abemama, you still can find physical evidence of American and Japanese WWII relics, cultural shrines and sites/monuments relating to their traditional spirits and famous King Binoka. Abemama is {{close enough to the}} capital of South Tarawa for a weekend getaway, and is often visited by cruising yachts due to its very sheltered lagoon. The lagoon is abundant in <b>bonefish,</b> a popular species with sport anglers.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a small amount of tourism, mainly {{associated}} with anglers interested in lagoon fishing (for <b>bonefish</b> in particular) or offshore fishing. Week-long ecotourism packages during which some of the normally closed areas can be visited are also available. In recent years, surfers have discovered that there are good waves during the Northern Hemisphere's winter season and there are interests developing to service these recreational tourists. There is some tourism-related infrastructure, such as a small hotel, rental facilities, and takeaways.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} whiting's {{similarity to}} all other species in the genus Sillago has led to many less abundant species being confused with it. The species is known to grow to a maximum size of 31cm, however reports dating back to 1850 in Bengal suggest the species attains 3 feet (91cm), {{which would make it}} the largest species of sillaginid. These reports were never etched into the literature on the species, possibly because of presumed confusion with the similar but unrelated and larger milkfish and <b>bonefish</b> that inhabit the area. The species has a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first made of feeble spines and the second of soft rays headed by a single feeble spine, while the ventral profile is straight.|$|E
50|$|Kemp's Bay {{is known}} for its <b>bonefishing</b> and its conch shells. The average shell on the island is the size of an American football. They are large pearly pink and can weigh as much as 15 lb. A {{traditional}} island food is the conch. It is a versatile food and can be served fried, in salad, or in soup.|$|R
50|$|The {{superorder}} Elopomorpha {{contains a}} variety of types of fishes that range from typical silvery-colored species, such as the tarpons and ladyfishes of the Elopiformes and the <b>bonefishes</b> of the Albuliformes, to the long and slender, smooth-bodied eels of the Anguilliformes. The one characteristic uniting this group of fishes is they all have leptocephalus larvae, which are unique to the Elopomorpha. No other fishes have this type of larvae.|$|R
25|$|Tourism is Andros Island's largest {{industry}}, and {{the largest}} private employer. The Bahamian tourism industry markets Andros as the least-explored island in the chain. From Nicholls Town in the north to Little Creek in the south are 35–40 hotels, motels, resorts, guest houses and lodges (the number varies), {{with a total of}} approximately 400 rooms. Tourists are composed primarily of scuba divers, attracted to the barrier reef, Tongue of the Ocean, and the Blue Holes; <b>bonefishing</b> anglers, and others looking for relaxation.|$|R
25|$|Fly {{fishing is}} most renowned {{as a method}} for {{catching}} trout, grayling and salmon, {{but it is also}} used {{for a wide variety of}} species including pike, bass, panfish, and carp, as well as marine species, such as redfish, snook, tarpon, <b>bonefish</b> and striped bass. Many fly anglers catch unintended species such as chub, bream and rudd while fishing for 'main target' species such as trout. A growing population of anglers attempt to catch as many different species as possible with the fly. With the advancement of technology and development of stronger rods and reels, larger predatory saltwater species such as wahoo, tuna, marlin and sharks have become target species on fly. Realistically any fish can be targeted and captured on fly as long as the main food source is effectively replicated by the fly itself and suitable gear is used.|$|E

Yet the island - home to beautiful beaches, unique wildlife and world-class fishing - has never fully reached its development potential. Most tourists who visit, do so for the unspoiled essence of the island. Visitors can also enjoy scuba diving, <b>bonefishing,</b> snorkeling, white crown pigeon hunting and bird watching. The eastern part of the island is a popular area for persons who are interested in crabbing (catching local island crabs) off-trail bikers.|$|R
50|$|Windermere Island is a {{small island}} located in The Bahamas. It is about {{five and a half}} miles long, and is noted for its beaches and its celebrity visitors, who use it as a private retreat. The island is {{connected}} to the larger island of Eleuthera by a short bridge, which is protected by a guardhouse. The bridge was built by Lord Trefgarne; who was a former owner of the Island. The adjoining waters and flats of Savannah Sound are considered to be a premier <b>bonefishing</b> location, and Windermere's five-mile long beach is protected by a five-mile long reef which is rich in fish and underwater flora.|$|R
40|$|In 2007, due {{to growing}} {{concerns}} of declines in nearshore fisheries in Hawai'i, {{a ban on}} gillnets was implemented in designated areas around the island of O'ahu in the main Hawaiian Islands. Utilizing a 17 year time-series of juvenile fish abundance beginning prior {{to the implementation of}} the gillnet ban, we examined the effects of the ban on the abundance of juveniles of soft-bottom associated fish species. Using a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) sampling design, we compared the abundance of targeted fishery species in a bay where gillnet fishing was banned (Kailua, O'ahu), and an adjacent bay where fishing is still permitted (Waimānalo, O'ahu). Our results show that when multiple juvenile fish species were combined, abundance declined over time in both locations, but the pattern varied {{for each of the four}} species groups examined. <b>Bonefishes</b> were the only species group with a significant BACI effect, with higher abundance in Kailua in the period after the gillnet ban. This study addressed a need for scientific assessment of a fisheries regulation that is rarely possible due to lack of quality data before enactment of such restrictions. Thus, we developed a baseline status of juveniles of an important fishery species, and found effects of a fishery management regulation in Hawai'i...|$|R

2500|$|Saltwater flyfishing is {{typically}} done with heavier tackle {{than that which}} is used for freshwater trout fishing, both to handle the larger, more powerful fish, and to accommodate the casting of larger and heavier flies. Salt water fly fishing typically employs the use of wet flies resembling baitfish, crabs, shrimp and other forage. However, saltwater fish can also be caught with poppers and other surface lure {{similar to those used}} for freshwater bass fishing, though much larger. Saltwater species sought and caught with fly tackle include: <b>bonefish,</b> redfish or red drum, permit, snook, spotted sea trout, tuna, dorado (mahi-mahi), sailfish, tarpon, striped bass, salmon, giant trevally and marlin. Offshore saltwater species are usually attracted to the fly by [...] "chumming" [...] with small baitfish, or [...] "teasing" [...] the fish to the boat by trolling a large hookless lure (Billfish are most often caught using this latter method).|$|E
40|$|Coastal {{resource}} management {{is an issue}} of concern for many people in the Bahamas. This Caribbean archipelago has seen many changes in the past 25 years since it won its Independence in 1974. The explosive growth of the tourism market has left urban centers such as Nassau showing serious signs of environmental degradation. Andros Island is the largest island in the archipelago and has seen essentially no significant growth during this same period of time. Currently Andros has tremendous growth potential in many areas such as tourism and agriculture. Businesses such as dive resorts and <b>bonefishing</b> lodges on Andros are interested in controlling future development {{in order to maintain the}} natural resource base upon which their interests are based. To this end, they are pushing for the establishment of a marine protected area that will encompass a significant portion of both terrestrial and marine resources. This paper is an attempt to summarize a vast body of literature regarding {{resource management}} in developing island nations. It includes a review of the development of modern resource management practices and environmental issues in the Caribbean. The focus is the use of community participation in the development of integrated resource management planning to facilitate the implementation of protected areas such as these. The intention is to provide the planners with a source of information from which to draw upon the necessary elements for an equitable and successful resource management regime...|$|R
40|$|Poverty {{reduction}} or alleviation {{is one of}} {{the most}} important economic aspects of Millennium Development Goals (MDG) which introduced by UNO in the Millennium Declaration at the Millennium Summit in 2000. This declaration lays out eight goals that align with the UN's main functions to be met by 2015. In order to meet these goals, poorer countries have pledged to invest in their people through health care and education while wealthier nations have vowed to support them by providing aid, debt relief, and fair trade. When developing countries were adversely affected by this bad economic condition and they began a process of development activities. Consequently, Poverty reduction has come to play a vital role in international development agenda during the last two decades. A number of developing countries have been formed to improve poverty reduction programme among the people and society. In line with this, Sri Lanka too has attempted to improve its poverty reduction since her independence. The main objective of this study is to assess the benefits to people of engaging in poor life condition with in Maruthamunai area of South Eastern part of Sri Lanka. A comparative analysis model was used to estimate the impact of Shakath Foundation on poverty reduction from selected explanatory variables. One of the key findings of this study is that in terms of size of the income and per capita income of the Maruthamunai has benefited immensely from Shakath Foundation programme. This study also reveals that Shakath Foundation has promoted income, wealth and self-employment to a considerable level at Maruthamunai economic way of life. It has also been found that the number of contributors has been increase occasionally meanwhile reducing a number of <b>bonefishes</b> for applying for funds. As Maruthamunai has been able to make significant gains from Shakath Foundation with other contributors, it is advisable that Maruthamunai reduces or eliminates all barriers simultaneously. Marthamunai could make further gains by moving into more advanced stages of institutions such as Baithulmal and Islamic Banking...|$|R
2500|$|Like many Indo-Pacific carangids, {{the biology}} and {{ecology of the}} blue {{trevally}} is poorly known, with the only data on the species relating to its diet. It is a fast-swimming predator which often forms small schools, and takes a variety of small fish (specifically mackerel and filefish), crustaceans including prawns, crabs, and sea lice, soft molluscs, and other soft prey. In Hawaii, they have been observed following foraging <b>bonefish</b> or goatfish, consuming any scraps uncovered by the foragers. The species {{appears to be in}} constant abundance all year, but ripe individuals have rarely been reported. No information regarding the reproduction and growth of the species is available, although [...] larvae of the species are known to appear during February in the waters off Taiwan, suggesting a December spawning period, and make up a high proportion of the larval abundance. Juveniles are known to sometimes shelter among the tentacles of large pelagic jellyfish.|$|E
6000|$|One {{man with}} heavy tackle yanked some <b>bonefish</b> {{out of the}} tide {{right in front of}} my cabin, quite as I used to haul out suckers. Other men tried it for days without success, though it {{appeared}} <b>bonefish</b> were passing every tide. Then there was a loquacious boatman named Jimmy, who, when he had spare time, was always fishing for <b>bonefish.</b> He would tell the most remarkable tales about these fish.

60|$|Then I {{began to}} fish for <b>bonefish</b> {{in front of my}} cottage. Whenever I would stick my rod in the sand and go in out of the hot sun a <b>bonefish</b> would take my bait and start off to sea. Before I could get back he would break something.|$|E
60|$|I {{just had}} a talk with a fellow who claims to know {{a good deal about}} bonefishing. He said he had caught a good many ranging up to eight pounds. His claim was that soldier crabs were the best bait. He said he had fished with {{professional}} boatmen who knew the game thoroughly. They would pole the skiff alongshore and keep a sharp lookout for what he called <b>bonefish</b> mud. And I assume that he meant muddy places in the water that had been stirred up by <b>bonefish.</b> Of course, any place where these little swirls could be seen was very likely to be a <b>bonefish</b> bank. He claimed that it was necessary to hold the line near the reel between the forefingers, and to feel for the very slightest vibration. <b>Bonefish</b> have a sucker-like mouth. They draw the bait in, and smash it. Sometimes, of course, they move away, drawing out the line, but that kind of a bite is exceptional. It is imperative to strike the fish when this vibration is felt. Not one in five <b>bonefish</b> is hooked.|$|E
60|$|My {{brother and}} I {{could not bring}} {{ourselves}} to try for <b>bonefish</b> with heavy tackle. It was preposterous. Three--four--five-pound fish! We had seen no larger.

60|$|More {{than once}} some benighted angler had {{mentioned}} <b>bonefish</b> to me.

60|$|First {{experience}} on a <b>bonefish</b> shoal. This wide area of coral mud was dry at low tide. When we arrived {{the tide was}} rising. Water scarcely a foot deep, very clear. Bottom white, with patches of brown grass. We saw <b>bonefish</b> everywhere and expected great sport. But no matter where we stopped we could not get any bites. Schools of <b>bonefish</b> swam up to the boat, only to dart away. Everywhere we saw thin white tails sticking out, as they swam along, feeding with noses in the mud. When we drew in our baits we invariably found them half gone, and it was our assumption that the blue crabs did this.|$|E
