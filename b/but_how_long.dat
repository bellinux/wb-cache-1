25|$|In the 13th century an Orthodox monastery {{was built}} over {{remnants}} {{of an earlier}} Byzantine predecessor, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it lasted is not known. However, pilgrimage to the site declined and according to one pilgrim the site was in ruins in 1484. From the 15th to the 19th century there were hardly any visits by pilgrims to the site. A small chapel dedicated to St. Mary of Egypt, a hermit from the Byzantine period, was built during the 19th century and was also destroyed in the 1927 earthquake.|$|E
25|$|So {{far there}} has been tacit {{approval}} between the central government and Pointe-Noire and the Department of Kouilou: Most of the mayors of the coastal city have since independence been most often nationals of this region. For example, Stéphane Tchitchéllé, Dr. Jacques Bouiti, Marcel Tchionvo, Jean-Pierre Thysthère Tchicaya, François-Luc Makosso, Roland Bouiti-Viaudo and the current director-Mayor Jean-François Kando (elected since 28th August 2017), are noted. The fact that the first Lady Antoinette Sassou-Nguesso born Tchibota originates from Pointe-Noire, militates for this status quo. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> will this agreement last, which the Vili consider their prerogative as descendants of this fief? Indeed, the economic lung of the Congo, as the gateway to and exiting the flow of goods, arouses increasingly heightened lust.|$|E

2500|$|The rule of marteloio {{addressed}} {{the problem of}} changing bearing at sea. More specifically, it helped a navigator plot the traverse from one navigational course to another. For example, suppose a ship was to sail from Corsica to Genoa, a course bearing straight north ("Tramontana") for some 130 miles. But the winds are not cooperative, and the ship was forced to sail northwest ("Maestro") for some 70 miles. [...] How does it return to its original route? [...] Re-setting its bearing to northeast ("Greco") seems sensible enough, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> should it sail on that bearing? [...] How would a navigator know when the ship had reached its old route and should turn north again? [...] How to avoid overshooting or undershooting the old course? ...|$|E
2500|$|There was a {{short period}} during the {{introduction}} of printing where parchment and paper were used at the same time, with parchment (in fact vellum) the more expensive luxury option, preferred by rich and conservative customers. Although most copies of the Gutenberg Bible are on paper, some were printed on parchment; 12 of the 48 surviving copies, with most incomplete. In 1490, Johannes Trithemius preferred the older methods, because [...] "handwriting placed on parchment {{will be able to}} endure a thousand years. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> will printing last, which is dependent on paper? For if ... it lasts for two hundred years that is a long time." [...] In fact high quality paper from this period has survived 500 years or more very well, if kept in reasonable library conditions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{stresses}} {{responsible for}} the elongate ridges and scarps must have occurred {{after the end of}} the primordial bombardment and after emplacement of the intermediate plains unit. Where smooth plains material abuts ridges and scarps, the evidence is mostly ambiguous because we cannot tell if ridge formation involved smooth plains material or if the ridges are upwarped intermediate plains material with smooth plains material ponded against them. On the floors of some craters, such as Gluck, scarps apparently offset material mapped as smooth plains, but the exposures are so small that this interpretation could easily be challenged. Ridges appear to be both older and younger than medium-size craters (30–60km in diameter) on the intermediate plains unit, but intersections of ridges with craters in this size range are too rare to constrain the time of ridge formation. Thus, ridge formation obviously occurred after emplacement of the intermediate plains unit, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> after remains uncertain in this quadrangle.|$|E
