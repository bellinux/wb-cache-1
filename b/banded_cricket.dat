50|$|Tropical house crickets are {{relatively}} {{new to the}} pet trade, and are favored by many people, due to easier care requirements than the more-common House cricket or the Black field <b>cricket.</b> The <b>banded</b> <b>crickets</b> {{are said to be}} a lot more active than competitors, and live longer lifespans than the average house cricket. They also have a lower chitin content than average crickets, making digestibility easier. Tropical house crickets are also immune to the CrPV virus. Care is similar to that of the House cricket.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Outwood's eyes sparkled {{behind their}} pince-nez. It was a {{disappointment}} to him that so few boys seemed to wish to belong to his chosen <b>band.</b> <b>Cricket</b> and football, games that left him cold, {{appeared to be the}} main interest in their lives. It was but rarely that he could induce new boys to join. His colleague, Mr. Downing, who presided over the School Fire Brigade, never had any difficulty in finding support. Boys came readily at his call. Mr. Outwood pondered wistfully on this at times, not knowing that the Fire Brigade owed its support {{to the fact that it}} provided its light-hearted members with perfectly unparalleled opportunities for ragging, while his own band, though small, were in the main earnest.|$|R

As they had often visited the Jacaranda club, its owner, Allan Williams, arranged for the photograph to be taken, subsequently taking over from Sutcliffe to book concerts for the group: Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe.

6000|$|A queer little maid, {{with a big}} cap, {{admitted}} Kipps {{and took}} him through a bead curtain and a door into a little drawing-room, with a black and gold piano, a glazed bookcase, a Moorish cosy corner and a draped looking glass over-mantel bright with Regent Street ornaments and photographs of various intellectual lights. A number of cards of invitation to meetings and the match list of a <b>Band</b> of Hope <b>cricket</b> club were stuck into the looking glass frame with Coote's name as a Vice-President. There was a bust of Beethoven over the bookcase and the walls were thick with conscientiously executed but carelessly selected [...] "views" [...] in oil and water colours and gilt frames. At {{the end of the}} room facing the light was a portrait that struck Kipps at first as being Coote in spectacles and feminine costume and that he afterwards decided must be Coote's mother. Then the original appeared and he discovered that it was Coote's elder and only sister who kept house for him. She wore her hair in a knob behind, and the sight of the knob suggested to Kipps an explanation for a frequent gesture of Coote's, a patting exploratory movement {{to the back of his}} head. And then it occurred to him that this was quite an absurd idea altogether.|$|R
