5|$|On {{the day of}} the Axis {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, the Executive Committee of the Communist Internationalheadquartered in Moscowtelegraphed the Central Committee of the KPJ to take all measures to support and alleviate the struggle of the Soviet people, and to organise partisan detachments to fight the Axis in Yugoslavia. The Executive Committee also stressed that the fight, at the current stage, should not be about socialist revolution, <b>but</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> liberation from the Axis occupiers. In response to this appeal, the leaders of the KPJ decided on 4July in Belgrade to launch a nationwide armed uprising, which began three days later in western Serbia. The members of the KPJ-led forces were called Partisans, and their supreme commander was Tito. On 13July, in Sarajevo, the KPJ Provincial Committee for Bosnia-Herzegovina, headed by Svetozar Vukmanović, organised the province into military regions: Bosanska Krajina, Herzegovina, Tuzla, and Sarajevo.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{leadership}} viewed {{events in}} Poland with alarm. De-Stalinisation was underway in the Soviet Union as well, but the Soviet leadership did not view the democratic reform that the Polish public desired as an acceptable solution. In Moscow, the belief was that any liberalisation in one bloc country {{could lead to}} the destruction of communism and the ruin of Soviet influence in the region as a whole. The Soviet Union was not worried solely about the political implications of reform <b>but</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> economic implications as well. Economically, the Soviet Union heavily invested in much of the Eastern Bloc and was striving for integration of its economies. The Soviet Union had financed Polish industry and was Poland's main trading partner. The Soviet Union directed what products Poland manufactured; the Soviets bought the products and exported goods to Poland no longer produced within the country itself. Due to this integration, any reform, whether political or economic, in one of the countries would inevitably have a great impact on the other. Because Poland was inextricably connected to the Soviet Union economically, the thought of an independent Polish economy was unrealistic. The country had been forced to rely on the Soviets {{for such a long time}} that breaking away completely would prove disastrous. Thus, both countries held crucial power in different facets. Poland could threaten Soviet strength and power in Eastern Europe politically, and the Soviet Union could essentially destroy the Polish economy. Therefore, any reform in the Polish government would have to concede to some Soviet demands, while the Soviets concurrently would have to concede to a vital partner.|$|E

Such languages are necessarily capable of enough self-reference for the diagonal lemma to apply to them. The broader philosophical import of Tarski's theorem is more strikingly evident.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{emphasis}} on play value, the scale of pre-World War II O gauge trains varied. The Märklin specifications called for 1:43.5 scale. However, many designs were 1:48 scale or 1:64 scale.

Yet all of these designs ran on the same track, and, depending on the manufacturer(s) of the cars, could sometimes be coupled together and run {{as part of the}} same train.|$|E
25|$|The comic is set during World War II, and {{the protagonist}} - Ernie Pike - is the narrator, without playing {{an active role}} in the stories. Unlike genre standards, the comic does not show any battles, and neither {{describes}} the war between Allies and Nazis as a conflict between good and evil. Instead, it centers on tragic events involving soldiers of both sides. Generally, those tragedies are misunderstandings that end up badly: characters who go mad, kill their own friends by friendly fire or because they believe them to be traitors, attempt to get killed in a specific way to avoid a more gruesome death, or who must mercy-kill badly hurt comrades, to cite several examples. Oesterheld, thus, utilizes war comics to reflect his personal dislike of war itself. The character never formulates positive or negative opinions about the allies, the nazis or specific events of the war, <b>but</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> morality of the soldiers in the anecdotes narrated. The stories take place at multiple locations of World War II, such as the European Theatre, the South Pacific ocean, the North African Campaign and the Eastern Front.|$|E

In that capacity, he championed the work of students Walter Mosley, Oscar Hijuelos, Philip Graham, Aurelie Sheehan, Salar Abdoh, Ernesto Quiñonez, and many others.

Tuten's short fiction has appeared in Granta, Conjunctions, Fence, Fiction, The New Review of Literature, Tri-Quarterly, and Harper's Magazine. In 1973, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing and in 2001 was given the Award for Distinguished Writing from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In describing his usage of the past in his novels (where many of them are set), Tuten once stated:The fact that I don’t write about contemporary life doesn’t mean I’m any less taken up with it. I find it too limiting to write about contemporary life just in contemporary diction, however. I don’t think there's enough flexibility. I can imagine writing about characters who feel passion for one another in a contemporary setting but I don’t, as yet, hear the language for that. But I’m always thinking about contemporary life vis a vis the way it looks in the past. I mean how it looks in the past is a reflection of what it is today. That's what interests me. I think I’m always talking about present-day life, not only political life <b>but</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> quality of passion, the quality of all relationships and love.|$|E
25|$|Sharp {{decided to}} emigrate to Australia on his father's suggestion. He arrived in Adelaide in November 1882 and early in 1883 {{obtained}} {{a position as}} a clerk in the Commercial Bank of South Australia. He read some law, and in April 1884 became associate to the Chief Justice, Sir Samuel James Way. He held this position until 1889 when he resigned and gave his whole time to music. He had become assistant organist at St Peter's Cathedral soon after he arrived, and had been conductor of the Government House Choral Society and the Cathedral Choral Society. Later he became conductor of the Adelaide Philharmonic, and in 1889 entered into partnership with I. G. Reimann as joint director of the Adelaide College of Music. He was very successful as a lecturer <b>but</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> middle of 1891 the partnership was dissolved. The school continued under Reimann, and in 1898 developed into the Elder Conservatorium of Music in connexion with the university. Sharp had made many friends and an address with over 300 signatures asked him to continue his work at Adelaide, but he {{decided to return to}} England and arrived there in January 1892. During his stay in Adelaide he composed the music for an operetta Dimple's Lovers performed by the Adelaide Garrick Club at the Albert Hall on 9 September 1890, and two light operas, Sylvia, which was produced at the Theatre Royal on 4 December 1890, and The Jonquil. The libretto in each case was written by Guy Boothby. Sharp also wrote the music for some nursery rhymes which were sung by the Cathedral Choral Society.|$|E

500|$|The {{themes of}} this Upanishad are {{meditation}} and renunciation.

According to Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, a professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics, this Upanishad seems to justify suicide in certain circumstances, a view opposed by earlier Vedic texts and principal Upanishads. The text discusses the city of Banaras as [...] "one Shiva never leaves", and as a holy place to revere. It also is among the earliest texts which states that the four stages of life are not necessarily sequential in that anyone can renounce their worldly life at any time. The Jabala Upanishad presents the Vedanta philosophy view that the proper life of a sannyasi is not about any rituals, nor wearing any sacrificial thread, <b>but</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> knowledge of one's soul (Atman, self).|$|E

Among his more famous works is the 1962 authoring and illustration of Arms and Equipment of the Civil War. Dale E. Biever, registrar at the Civil War Library and Museum in Philadelphia, described the work as [...] "not about generals or battles <b>but</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> things one should know before delving into those areas...a welcome addition to any Civil War library." [...] It was republished several times, most recently in 2004. In 1966, Coggins wrote and illustrated The Horseman's Bible, which sold over 500,000copies with a revised edition published in 1984. In this book Coggins acknowledges his father [...] "whose twenty five years in the cavalry and lifetime interest in horses made his advice invaluable." [...] Coggins's last book was Marine Painter's Guide, which was first published in 1983. After the book was published, he decided to stop writing to concentrate more on painting. A new edition of Marine Painter's Guide was published in 2005 by Dover Publications, the publisher of new editions for several of his books.|$|E
500|$|The film project {{started in}} late 2004 when John Nordling, a {{producer}} at the production company EFTI, contacted Ajvide Lindqvist's publisher Ordfront {{to acquire the}} rights for a film adaptation of his novel, Let the Right One In: [...] "At Ordfront they just laughed when I called, I was like the 48th they put on the list.
