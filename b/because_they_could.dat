5|$|Connolly {{has argued}} that they were armed as a pike phalanx. This has been disputed by Head, because Plutarch states they carried spears shorter than the Roman triarii and by Daly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not have carried an {{unwieldy}} pike {{at the same time}} as a heavy Roman-style shield.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the tension in late-December, the {{standoff}} remained. The US hoped the generals would relent <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not survive and be able to repel the communists or rival officers without aid from Washington. On the other hand, Khánh and the Young Turks expected the Americans would become more worried about the communist gains first and acquiesce to their fait accompli against the HNC. The generals were correct.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{positive}} response the game {{would go on}} to receive, Year of the Dragon was developer Insomniac Games' last Spyro title. In an interview, CEO Ted Price said that the company stopped producing the games <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not do anything new with the character, and that after five years of development on a single series, the team wanted to do something different. Future Spyro games were produced by, among other developers, Digital Eclipse, Equinox Digital Entertainment, Eurocom, Krome Studios, Étranges Libellules, and Tantalus Media.|$|E

3000|$|... 1 In particular, Méndez (2013) {{criticizes the}} {{assumption}} of Hernanz et al. (2003) that individuals aged between 30 and 45 could not be hired with the new open-ended contracts. According to Méndez (2013), this is not correct <b>because</b> <b>they</b> actually <b>could</b> if <b>they</b> had been previously hired as fixed-term workers.|$|R
5|$|In the end, the {{following}} five drivers failed {{to qualify for the}} Daytona 500 <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not finish high enough in their respective Duels or turn a fast enough qualifying lap: Casey Mears, Todd Bodine, Derrike Cope, Kevin Conway, and Michael McDowell. The second race had a record-breaking total of 22 lead changes in the Gatorade Duels among seven different drivers and had five caution periods. Burton's total of 17 laps led was the highest of any competitor.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys from Costa Rica have {{historically}} been referred to O.c.couesi, but Hanson and colleagues found that two specimens from Refugio Nacional de Vida Silvestre Mixto Maquenque, northeastern Costa Rica, differed as much from other O.couesi (11.93% Cytb sequence divergence) as O.couesi differed from the marsh rice rat (11.30%). They suggested that these animals represented a species distinct from O.couesi, but were unable to resolve the correct name for the species <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not examine samples of dimidiatus or richmondi.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound varies with {{temperature}}. Since temperature and sound velocity normally decrease with increasing altitude, sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an acoustic shadow at {{some distance from the}} source. In the 1862, during the American Civil War Battle of Iuka, an acoustic shadow, believed to have been enhanced by a northeast wind, kept two divisions of Union soldiers out of the battle, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not hear the sounds of battle only six miles downwind.|$|E
6000|$|Marston agreed. Their {{business}} {{was not to}} take a side. Indeed, it was unthinkable that they should help either party.

50|$|He also {{supplied}} decorations for provincial theaters. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> generally <b>could</b> {{not afford}} full new sets for each production, {{he created a}} series of scenarios (about a dozen) that could be easily readapted for the occasion. None of these survive, but albums of watercolor sketches have been preserved at the Museo Correr.|$|R
50|$|The front {{stabilized}} roughly {{around the}} Greek border, through {{the intervention of}} a Franco-British-Italian force which had landed in Salonica. The German generals had not let the Bulgarian army advance towards Salonika, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> hoped <b>they</b> <b>could</b> persuade the Greeks to join the Central powers.|$|R
5|$|Two {{other parties}} sought to be {{involved}} in the case as amici curiae, Amnesty International (represented by former Federal Court Justice Ron Merkel), and the Victorian human rights advocacy group the Human Rights Law Resource Centre. However both their applications were rejected, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not assist the court in a way in which they could not otherwise be assisted, and their submissions were largely subsumed into submissions made by Lasry in any event.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 16th century, horse teams were {{beginning}} to replace ox teams in ploughing work in Britain because of their greater speed, strength and agility, particularly on lighter soils; in heavier soils ox teams retained an advantage, both because they pulled more steadily, albeit more slowly, and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> work despite being fed by grazing alone. While the horse collar, which allows a horse greater freedom to pull heavy loads, {{had been used in}} western Europe by the 10th century, and may be shown in the Bayeux Tapestry of the 11th or 12th century, the use of horse teams in Britain was made possible in part because of an increase in the farming of oats, a staple food for hard-working horses.|$|E
5|$|Invertebrate predators include crabs, starfish and octopuses. Crabs {{crack the}} shells with their pincers and starfish use their water {{vascular}} system {{to force the}} valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. This was probably <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> manipulate the shells and open them more easily when they could tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell and insert a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E

Exactly. He's not just beeping for himself, he's beeping for ALL OF US.|$|R
50|$|Breck {{was born}} in Rochester, New York. He grew up living with his {{grandparents}} in Haverhill, Massachusetts, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> felt <b>they</b> <b>could</b> provide a more stable home environment than his father, who often traveled as a jazz musician. He attended the University of Houston, where he studied English and drama.|$|R
50|$|Keta was an {{important}} trading post between the 14th and the late 20th centuries. The town attracted {{the interest of the}} Danish, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> felt <b>they</b> <b>could</b> establish a base here without interference from rival European nations. Their first initiative was to place a factor at Keta to sell alcohol.|$|R
5|$|The law {{partnership}} of Despard, Maxwell, and Goff was in operation until {{the autumn of}} 1866, when Maxwell was elected as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. Maxwell {{and the other three}} justices were chosen because of their early statehood leadership, and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be depended upon to defend the new state from Virginia sympathies and uphold the Unionist cause. While serving on the court, the major issues that faced Maxwell and the justices primarily involved post-war reconstruction and sectional acrimonies across the state. He served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court from January 1, 1867 until December 31, 1872.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} Black Hebrews arrived in Israel in 1969, they claimed {{citizenship}} under the Law of Return, which gives eligible Jews immediate citizenship. The Israeli government ruled in 1973 {{that the group}} did not qualify for automatic citizenship <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not prove Jewish descent and had not undergone Orthodox conversion. The Black Hebrews were denied work permits and state benefits. The group accused the Israeli government of racist discrimination. In 1981, a group of American civil rights activists led by Bayard Rustin investigated and concluded that racism was {{not the cause of}} the Black Hebrews' situation. No official action was taken to return the Black Hebrews to the United States, but some individual members were deported for working illegally.|$|E
5|$|Both of the World Wars had a {{major impact}} on Stroma, which was only a dozen miles from the Royal Navy's chief base at Scapa Flow in Orkney. Six islanders died in each of the World Wars; the names of all twelve are inscribed on the island's war memorial, and during the Second World War as much as a quarter of the {{population}} was on war service. Adding to the island's economic problems, the introduction of the 11-plus exam in 1944 meant that all children over the age of 12 had to leave Stroma to complete their education at the secondary school in Wick. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not commute between the island and Wick, they had to attend school as boarders, which incurred additional expenses for their parents.|$|E
25|$|A third group, the {{occupational}} clans, have sometimes {{been treated as}} outcasts <b>because</b> traditionally <b>they</b> <b>could</b> only marry among themselves and other Somalis considered them to be ritually unclean. They lived in their own settlements among the nomadic populations {{in the north and}} performed specialised occupations such as metalworking, tanning and hunting. Minority Somali clans include the Gaboye, Tumaal, Yibir, Jaji and Yahar.|$|R
60|$|It will need, I think, some careful thought {{thoroughly}} {{to understand}} this text. Our Lord in it calls the Pharisees and Sadducees hypocrites; <b>because,</b> though <b>they</b> <b>could</b> use their common sense and experience to judge of the weather they would not use them to judge of {{the signs of the}} times; of {{what was going to happen}} to the Jewish nation.|$|R
50|$|Colin {{was raised}} by Christian parents who pulled him out of Grade 3 <b>because</b> <b>they</b> felt <b>they</b> <b>could</b> {{do a better job}} than the system was doing. Colin was home‐schooled {{alongside}} his 3 younger siblings until Grade 9 at which point his parents finally granted their son’s request to attend a nearby arts school.|$|R
5|$|Locomotives were used, {{the first}} one running by November 8, but this {{was too late to}} affect the outcome of the siege. The {{locomotives}} were not effective <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not manage even the easy gradient from Balaclava to Kadikoi with more than a light load. Five second-hand locomotives, purchased by the contractors from collieries and railway companies in England, are known to have arrived. Alliance and Victory were two small 0-6-0 saddle tanks built by E. B. Wilson & Co of Leeds in 1854/5; two from the London & North Western Railway, Nos 13 and 50, were 2-2-0 Bury-type passenger engines built by Benjamin Hick & Son of Bolton in 1838 and 1840; the fifth locomotive was Swan from the St Helens Canal & Railway Co, but its details remain obscure.|$|E
5|$|Mason {{had long}} battled against Alexandria merchants who he felt unfairly {{dominated}} the county court, if only <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> more easily {{get to the}} courthouse. In 1789, he drafted legislation to move the courthouse {{to the center of}} the county, though it did not pass in his lifetime. In 1798, the legislature passed an authorizing act, and the courthouse opened in 1801. Most of those at Gunston Hall, both family and slaves, fell ill during the summer of 1792, experiencing chills and fever; when those subsided, Mason caught a chest cold. When Jefferson visited Gunston Hall on October 1, 1792, he found Mason, long a martyr to gout, needing a crutch to walk, though still sound in mind and memory. Additional ailments, possibly pneumonia, set in. Less than a week after Jefferson's visit, on October 7, George Mason died at Gunston Hall, and was subsequently buried on the estate, within sight of the house he had built and of the Potomac River.|$|E
5|$|The {{naming of}} the {{stations}} caused local debate. A draft for names {{were made by}} the municipal administration and then sent to the borough councils in Fana, Årstad and Bergenhus. Four names were changed: Nonneseteren from Jernbanen, Florida from Strømmen, Brann stadion from Nymark and Hop from Troldhaugen. Brann stadion and Troldhaugen were afterwards considered by the municipal administration, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be in violation of the Place Name Act. The general rule is to use the place name where the station is located, and naming after institutions or facilities nearby is not permitted unless they are in the immediate vicinity. Brann stadion, named for the football venue, was declared a borderline case, but within the rules, while Troldhaugen was not permitted because the area is not {{in the vicinity of the}} station.|$|E
60|$|The {{economic}} {{revolution of}} the Roman Republic had never been clearly apprehended by the common people of Rome. The ordinary Roman citizen never saw the changes through which he lived, clearly and comprehensively as we see them. But the industrial revolution, as it went on {{towards the end of}} the nineteenth century, was more and more distinctly seen as one whole process by the common people it was affecting, <b>because</b> presently <b>they</b> <b>could</b> read and discuss and communicate, and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> went about and saw things as no commonalty had ever done before.|$|R
5000|$|Former defense {{minister}} Santos was elected President of Colombia in 2010; in 2012 he backed legislation {{that has been}} criticized by human rights groups <b>because</b> <b>they</b> fear it <b>could</b> potentially revert the [...] "false positive" [...] cases to military courts.|$|R
6000|$|They know well, Master, [...] That all I {{said was}} {{but to make}} them argue. [...] They've pushed me in to make a mock of me, [...] <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> knew I <b>could</b> take either side [...] And beat them at it.|$|R
5|$|The players {{acquired}} by Fletcher matured {{into one of}} the strongest teams in the league during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. From 1984–85 to 1990–91, the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one. However, they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run, largely <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Oilers. Although the Oilers and Flames usually finished at or {{near the top of the}} Campbell Conference, the NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very likely that the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in Campbell Conference finals. That same structure made it very likely that the other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division would have to get past the Flames or Oilers (or both) in order to make it to the conference finals. From 1983 until 1990, either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|They had {{submitted}} to three reductions of wages in three years; {{that they would}} have acquiesced in a moderate reduction; that they were frequently sent out on a trip to Martinsburg, and there detained four days at the discretion of the company, for which detention they were allowed pay but two day's time; that they were compelled to pay their board during the time they were detained, which was more than the wages they received; that they had nothing left with which to support their families; that {{it was a question of}} bread with them; that when times were dull on the road they could not get more than fifteen day's work in a month; that many sober, steady economical men became involved in debt last winter; that honest men had their wages attached <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not meet their expenses; that by a rule of the company any man who had his wages attached should be discharged; that this was a tyranny to which no rational being should submit, and that it was utterly impossible for a man with a family to support himself and family at the reduced rate of wages.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys {{is rare in}} Panama. Panamanian Oryzomys {{were first}} {{described}} by Goldman in 1912, who introduced the name Oryzomys gatunensis for a specimen from Gatún in the Canal Zone. In 1918, Goldman kept the animal as a separate species, remarking that it was similar to richmondi, but distinctive in the well-developed ridges along {{the margins of the}} interorbital region, the short interparietal bone (part of the roof of the braincase), and the long nasal bones. In 1937, Bole described another species of Panamanian Oryzomys, Oryzomys azuerensis from Paracoté, Veraguas Province. It is a brown form, lacking the reddish tones of nearby populations, and has a broad skull with a short rostrum (front part) and ridges on the interorbital region like those of gatunensis. Although Goldman recommended to him that gatunensis and azuerensis both be treated as subspecies of couesi, Bole described azuerensis as a species because it did not seem intermediate between the geographically closest forms, gatunensis and couesi, and was separated by a large gap from the nearest known populations of O.couesi in northwestern Costa Rica and southeastern Nicaragua. In a 1966 review of Panamanian mammals, Charles Handley reduced both gatunensis and azuerensis to subspecies of the marsh rice rat (in which O.couesi was included at the time), and when O.couesi was reinstated as a separate species these forms went with it. Specimens from near the type locality of azuerensis differ by about 7% in their Cytb sequences from other O.couesi, which suggests that they may represent a separate species. However, Hanson and colleagues did not reinstate azuerensis as a species, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not examine samples of gatunensis.|$|E
50|$|They were {{commonly}} used in three pairs. Like most previous PRR electric locomotives, they were straight AC-powered, and did not use rectifiers. <b>Because</b> of this, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> work in multiple with existing PRR locomotives, and generally did so with class P5a.|$|R
6000|$|... (b) The {{one thing}} in the world that {{he wanted to do was}} to be right here, for the most miraculous event of which he had ever heard was meeting Miss Nash. First one, then the other, these {{thoughts}} swashed back and forth like the swinging tides. He got away from them only long enough to rejoice that somehow--he didn't know how--he was going to be her most intimate friend, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were both Americans in a strange land and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> both <b>could</b> make-believe.|$|R
5000|$|Chapter One has no plot, {{but rather}} {{is a basic}} {{description}} of the Land of Mo, or [...] "The Beautiful Valley". It explains that everyone in Mo is happy, and that the people never need to work, <b>because</b> everything <b>they</b> <b>could</b> desire grows on the trees, including items such as clothes. In A New Wonderland, the author mentions planning to move there himself, but this was omitted from subsequent editions.|$|R
