5|$|The {{majority}} of sea terns have light grey or white body plumage as adults, {{with a black}} cap to the head. The legs and bill are various combinations of red, orange, yellow, or black depending on species. The pale plumage is conspicuous from a distance at sea, and may attract other birds to a good feeding area for these fish-eating species. When seen against the sky, the white underparts also help to hide the hunting bird from its intended prey. The Inca tern has mainly dark plumage, and three species that mainly eat insects, the <b>black</b> <b>tern,</b> white-winged tern, and black-bellied tern, have black underparts in the breeding season. The Anous noddies have dark plumage with a pale head cap. The reason for their dark plumage is unknown, {{but it has been}} suggested that in tropical areas, where food resources are scarce, the less conspicuous colouration makes it harder for other noddies to detect a feeding bird. Plumage type, especially the head pattern, is linked to the phylogeny of the terns, and the pale-capped, dark-bodied noddies are believed to have diverged earlier than the other genera from an ancestral white-headed gull, followed by the partially black-headed Onychoprion and Sternula groupings.|$|E

40|$|Wetlands {{throughout}} eastern South Dakota {{were surveyed}} (1995 - 97) for foraging and nesting <b>black</b> <b>terns</b> (Chlidonias niger) to evaluate local and landscape factors influencing habitat suitability. We surveyed 834 randomly selected, semipermanent, and seasonal wetlands that were stratified by physiographic domain, wetland density, and wetland surface area.

500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged <b>black</b> <b>tern,</b> alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting.

40|$|By 2013, six of 27 <b>Black</b> <b>Terns</b> (Chlidonias niger) {{from four}} Dutch colonies that had {{received}} light level geolocators in 2010 – 2011 had been recaptured. All six recovered individuals migrated to West Africa, but whereas one individual flew there nonstop, the others made stops of varying length en route. These included flights of 2, 000 – 6, 000 km between major stopovers, achieving travel speeds over 1, 000 km/day. In {{addition to the}} single previously known postbreeding stopover, Lake Ijsselmeer, this work revealed postbreeding stopovers at the Alborán Sea, the seas near the Canary Islands and at the Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania. Staging durations varied between 2 and 35 days, and the longer the staging took, the longer the subsequent flights were. In the West African nonbreeding region, the <b>Black</b> <b>Terns</b> with geolocators staged at the Banc d'Arguin, the marine continental edge seas between Senegal and Liberia, and the Gulf of Guinea, or went {{as far south as}} the Benguela Current off Namibia. Most birds spent most of their time far offshore. Northward migration for the three birds with active geolocators took 38 – 39 days with staging episodes near the Canary Islands and in the Mediterranean west of Italy. One individual crossed the Sahara from Senegal to northern Algeria in 3 days. After arrival in Europe, travel speeds were lower than when in transit from West Africa. Even with a sample size of six, we showed that <b>Black</b> <b>Terns</b> are long-distance migrants with substantial individual variation in migration patterns, including the use of staging sites, stopover times and travel distances. The variation in itineraries may imply that the distribution of the marine resources they rely on are relatively unpredictable. It {{remains to be seen whether}} the variability seen here reflects differences in otherwise fixed individual strategies or whether <b>Black</b> <b>Terns</b> are truly highly flexible...|$|R

60|$|There {{was nothing}} new to me in all this: {{it was an old}} {{familiar}} story; I have given it fully, simply because it is an accurate statement of what is being done all over the country. There is not a county in the kingdom where you may not hear of important members of the community who are collectors of birds and their eggs, and law-breakers, both directly and indirectly, every day of their lives. They all take, and pay for, every rare visitant that comes in their way, and also require an unlimited supply of the rarer resident species for the purpose of exchange with other private collectors in distant counties. In this way our finest species are gradually being extirpated. Within the last few years we have seen the disappearance (as breeding species) of the ruff and reeve, marsh harrier, and honey buzzard; and the species now on the verge of extinction, which will soon follow these and others that have gone before, if indeed some of them have not already gone, are the sea-eagle, osprey, kite, hen harrier, Montagu's harrier, stone curlew, Kentish plover, dotterel, red-necked phalarope, roseate tern, bearded tit, grey-lag goose, and great skua. These in their turn will be followed by the chough, hobby, great black-backed gull, furze wren, crested tit, and others. These are the species which, as things are going, will absolutely and for ever disappear, as residents and breeders, from off the British Islands. Meanwhile other species that, although comparatively rare, are less local in their distribution, are being annually exterminated {{in some parts of the}} country: it is poor comfort to the bird lover in southern England to know that many species that formerly gave life and interest to the scene, and have lately been done to death there, may still be met with in the wilder districts of Scotland, or in some forest in the north of Wales. Finally, we have among our annual visitants a considerable number of species which have either bred in these islands in past times (some quite recently), or else would probably remain to breed if they were not immediately killed on arrival--bittern, little bittern, night heron, spoonbill, stork, avocet, <b>black</b> <b>tern,</b> hoopoe, golden oriole, and many others of less well-known names.|$|E
