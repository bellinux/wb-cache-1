40|$|International audienceFifty years ago, Joseph Smagorinsky {{published}} a landmark paper (1) describing numerical experiments using the primitive equations (a set of fluid equations that describe global atmospheric flows). In so doing, he introduced what later {{became known as}} a General Circulation Model (GCM). GCMs have come to provide a compelling framework for coupling the atmospheric circulation to {{a great variety of}} processes. Although early GCMs could only consider a small subset of these processes, it was widely appreciated that a more comprehensive treatment was necessary to adequately represent the drivers of the circulation. But how comprehensive this treatment must be was unclear and, as Smagorinsky realized (2), could only be determined through numerical experimentation. These types of experiments have since shown that an adequate description of <b>basic</b> processes like <b>cloud</b> <b>formation,</b> moist convection, and mixing is what climate models miss most...|$|R

5000|$|Asperitas (formerly {{known as}} Undulatus asperatus) is a <b>cloud</b> <b>formation</b> first popularized and {{proposed}} {{as a type}} of cloud in 2009 by Gavin Pretor-Pinney of the Cloud Appreciation Society.

50|$|Another major {{finding of}} her {{research}} {{is related to}} <b>cloud</b> <b>formation.</b> In order for a cloud to form, water must condense into droplets. Organic sulfur compounds in the atmosphere create aerosols that serve as cloud condensation nuclei. An organic sulfur compound known as DMSP (dimethylsulfoniopropionate) is produced in large quantities by photosynthetic plankton in ocean. If DMSP is converted to dimethyl sulfide (DMS), the DMS rises into the atmosphere and increases <b>cloud</b> <b>formation.</b> Moran's research group discovered key genes in Roseobacter and Pelagibacteria that breakdown DMSP into methanethiol instead, a chemical compound that does not enter the atmosphere or increase <b>cloud</b> <b>formation.</b> Basically, Moran's research group made a major discovery that explains connections between the marine microbial food web and <b>cloud</b> <b>formation</b> over the oceans. That research also helped in identifying the biochemical pathway that controls how bacteria release methanethiol into the microbial food web, making it available to other bacteria as well.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Clouds {{seem like}} an every-day experience. But – do we know how clouds form on brown dwarfs and extra-solar planets? How do they look like? Can we see them? What are they {{composed}} of? <b>Cloud</b> <b>formation</b> is an old-fashioned but still outstanding problem for the Earth atmosphere, and it {{has turned into a}} challenge for the modelling of brown dwarf and exo-planetary atmospheres. <b>Cloud</b> <b>formation</b> imposes strong feedbacks on the atmospheric structure, not only due to the clouds own opacity, but also due to the depletion of the gas phase, possibly leaving behind a dynamic and still supersaturated atmosphere.

40|$|This site {{facilitates}} {{a classroom}} {{activity in which}} students create a hypothesis on <b>cloud</b> <b>formation</b> and then conduct online research to either validate or refute their initial hypothesis. The activity begins with a brief laboratory experiment that demonstrates <b>cloud</b> <b>formation</b> and asks students to generate a hypothesis on how clouds form. The activity then switches to students conducting Internet research. Finally, small groups of students will create reports summarizing the <b>cloud</b> <b>formation</b> process, and each group will present their report to the class. Students are then encouraged to compare their final reports with the initial hypothesis created by the class. Students can also track and research local weather patterns, and study how technology is utilized in predicting weather. Educational levels: High school, Intermediate elementary, Middle school...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between two parameters characterizing a given location on a given day: the daily clear skyindex KT* and the intraday variability given by the standard deviation {{of the changes in}} the hourly clear sky index rðDktDtÞ. Empiricalevidence assembled from twenty climatically distinct locations led us to derive a simple model to infer intraday variability from the day’sclear sky index. Although the model shows little dependence on location, we did observe a systematic difference traceable to a location’sprevailing <b>cloud</b> <b>formation</b> regime. Therefore, we also propose two alternative models for sites where <b>cloud</b> <b>formations</b> is influenced bylocal orography and sites where <b>cloud</b> <b>formation</b> is traceable to weather events only.

40|$|Driven by {{analyzed}} {{winds and}} temperature, domain-filling forward trajectory calculations {{are used to}} reproduce water vapor and <b>cloud</b> <b>formations</b> in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL). As with most Lagrangian models of this type, excess water vapor is instantaneously removed from the parcel to keep the relative humidity with respect to ice from exceeding a specified (super) saturation level. The dehydration occurrences serve {{as an indication of}} where and when cloud forms. Convective moistening through ice lofting and gravity waves are also included in our simulations as mechanisms that could affect water vapor abundances and <b>cloud</b> <b>formations</b> in the TTL. Our simulations produce water vapor mixing ratios close to that observed by the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and are consistent with the reanalysis tropical tropopause temperature biases, which proves the importance of the cold-point temperature to the water vapor abundances in the stratosphere. The simulation of <b>cloud</b> <b>formation</b> agrees with the patterns of cirrus distribution from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO).

40|$|Figure 1 : Clouds {{generated}} by our method. The pink curve indicates the desired shape {{specified by the}} user. Our method controls the <b>cloud</b> <b>formation</b> process {{in order to make}} clouds form the desired shape. Clouds play an important role for creating realistic images of outdoor scenes. In order to generate realistic clouds, many methods have been developed for modeling and animating clouds. One of the most effective approaches for synthesizing realistic clouds is to simulate <b>cloud</b> <b>formation</b> processes based on the atmospheric fluid dynamics. Although this approach can create realistic clouds, the resulting shapes and motion depend on many simulation parameters and the initial status. Therefore, {{it is very difficult to}} adjust those parameters so that the clouds form the desired shapes. This paper addresses this problem and presents a method for controlling the simulation of <b>cloud</b> <b>formation.</b> In this paper, we focus on controlling cumuliform <b>cloud</b> <b>formation.</b> The user specifies the overall shape of the clouds. Then, our method automatically adjusts parameters during the simulation in order to generate clouds forming the specified shape. Our method can generate realistic clouds while their shapes closely match to the desired shape...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that cosmic ray events could have a causal relationship with <b>cloud</b> <b>formation</b> rates. Given the weak constraints on the role that <b>cloud</b> <b>formation</b> plays in climate forcing {{it is essential to}} understand the role such a relationship could have in shaping the Earth’s climate. This issue has been previously investigated {{in the context of the}} long-term effect of cosmic ray events on climate. However, in order to establish whether or not such a relationship exists, measurements of short-timescale solar events, individual cosmic ray events, and spatially correlated cloud parameters could be of great significance. Here we propose such a comparison using observations from a pair of radio telescopes arrays, the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) and the Eight-meter-wavelength Transient Array (ETA). These low-frequency radio arrays have a unique ability to simul-taneously conduct solar, ionospheric and cosmic rays observations and are thus ideal for such a comparison. We will outline plans for a comparison using data from these instru-ments, satellite images of <b>cloud</b> <b>formation</b> as well as expected <b>cloud</b> <b>formation</b> rates from numerical models. We present some preliminary results illustrating the efficacy of this type of comparison and discuss future plans to carryout this program...|$|R
