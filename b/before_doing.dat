5|$|Falun Gong sources {{overseas}} {{questioned the}} official Chinese government {{account of the}} event, and apparent inconsistencies in government's official narrative led to a hypothesis that the self-immolation was staged {{by the government to}} justify the persecution against Falun Gong by portraying its practitioners as irrational and suicidal. According to this hypothesis, the self-immolation participants were paid actors, and were presumably assured that the flames would be extinguished <b>before</b> <b>doing</b> real harm.|$|E
5|$|On November 2, 2002, U.S. Marine Corps Major Michael Brown {{attempted}} an {{indecent assault}} on a Filipina bartender in Okinawa, Japan. The bartender accused Brown of attempting to rape her and of throwing her cell phone into a nearby river; Brown denied the rape charges. The victim later recanted and attempted to withdraw the accusation, though prosecutors presented evidence that she had received a cash payment just <b>before</b> <b>doing</b> so.|$|E
5|$|In Blue Heelers twelfth season, {{ratings were}} at an all time low of 1.2 million viewers per episode, which {{was less than}} half what the show had been {{attracting}} during its peak from 1997 to 2000, when it was drawing more than 2.5 million viewers. After these falling ratings during 2005, Seven decided to take action and considered cancelling the series altogether. However, <b>before</b> <b>doing</b> this, they commissioned a shortened season consisting of only 11 episodes, taking the show's episode tally to 510. This season was shortened from the normal season length of around 40 episodes.|$|E

5|$|In summer 1857, Smetana {{came home}} to Prague and found Kateřina in failing health. In June, Smetana's father František died. That autumn Smetana {{returned}} to Gothenburg, with Kateřina and their surviving daughter Žofie, but <b>before</b> <b>doing</b> so he visited Liszt in Weimar. The occasion was the Karl August Goethe-Schiller Jubilee celebrations; Smetana attended performances of Liszt's Faust Symphony and the symphonic poem Die Ideale, which invigorated and inspired him. Liszt was Smetana's principal teacher throughout the latter's creative life, and at this time was crucially able to revive his spirits and rescue him from the relative artistic isolation of Gothenburg.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August, the RAN {{was placed}} under Admiralty control. Orders for RAN {{warships}} were prepared {{over the next}} few days: Australia was assigned to the concentration of British naval power on the China Station, but was allowed to seek out and destroy any armoured warships (particularly those of the German East Asia Squadron) in the Australian Station <b>before</b> <b>doing</b> so. Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee, commander of the German squadron, was aware of Australias presence in the region and her superiority to his entire force; the German admiral's plan was to harass British shipping and colonies in the Pacific until the presence of Australia and the China Squadron forced his fleet to relocate to other seas.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Ewiniar, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Ester, was the third named storm of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season and one that lasted for twelve days as a {{tropical}} cyclone, moving on a generally northward track. During its lifespan, it affected Palau, Yap, eastern China, the Ryūkyū Islands of Japan, South Korea as well as North Korea, briefly threatening to make landfall in North Korea <b>before</b> <b>doing</b> so in South Korea. Ewiniar is responsible for at least 181 deaths. However, an unofficial report stated that up to 10,000 people {{had been killed by}} flooding in North Korea, with 4,000people missing.|$|E

5|$|Williams {{had long}} planned {{to design a}} horror game, but waited eight years for {{software}} technology to improve <b>before</b> <b>doing</b> so. More than 200 people {{were involved in the}} making of Phantasmagoria, which was based on Williams' 550-page script, about four times the length of an average Hollywood screenplay. It took more than two years to develop and four months to film. Originally budgeted for US$800,000, the game ultimately cost $4.5 million to develop, and it was filmed in a $1.5 million studio Sierra built specifically for the game.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} proper, Lewis Hamilton {{was able to}} hold his lead, while his {{teammate}} Nico Rosberg tried to attack Sebastian Vettel in second place. This opened up the opportunity for the second Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen {{to go around the}} outside of the Mercedes and take third. Hamilton tried to open up a gap in order to cover his position, should the Ferrari drivers attempt a so-called undercut, a strategy in which a car entered the pit lane early in order to use fresher tyres to get in front of another car without overtaking them on track. Meanwhile, Rosberg took back third from Räikkönen on lap four <b>before</b> <b>doing</b> the same with Vettel on the end of lap nine.|$|E

5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>doing</b> so, Marty travels up to Travers' {{house to}} try to {{convince}} Travers to allow him to keep Shiloh. Judd does not see Marty approaching, and shoots a doe out of season, which would mean a stiff fine Judd cannot afford. Marty lets Judd know he knows, and attempts to blackmail him out of Shiloh. Judd and Marty eventually negotiate a deal in which Marty will earn Shiloh for 40 dollars, paid with 20 hours of working for Judd. At {{the end of the first}} week, Judd says that he will not keep his end of the deal because the evidence of the dead doe has with the passage of time disappeared. Second, the contract that Marty had him sign is worthless in the state of West Virginia without the signature of a witness. Despite Judd's pointed disapproval of his work, Marty continues to work for him. They begin discussing dogs and Judd's father who began physically abusing Judd when he was four years old. In the end, Judd warms to Marty, relents, and lets him keep Shiloh.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{took the}} new ball and felt {{pain in his}} groin again after {{delivering}} his first ball. He persevered through the pain and removed Washbrook in his fourth over. Hutton then fell to Johnson to leave England at 32/2. Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich <b>before</b> <b>doing</b> the same to Dollery for a duck two balls later. England were 46/4 and Australia were firmly in control. Compton was joined by his skipper Yardley and the pair rebuilt the innings, scoring 87 runs together in 100 minutes. After the tea break, Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball. Compton edged Johnston to be out for 53. One run later, Lindwall bowled Yardley to leave England at 134/6 with their skipper dismissed for 44. Johnson then removed Evans for nine, before Coxon and Laker added 41 for the eighth wicket. After 85 minutes of resistance, Johnston removed both. England's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 9/207.|$|E
5|$|Scarification had {{its origins}} in Nri mythology. Nri, the son of Eri who {{established}} the town of Nri, {{was said to have}} pleaded to Chukwu (the Great God) because of hunger. Chukwu then ordered him to cut off his first son's and daughter's heads and plant them, creating a 'blood bond' between the Igbo and the earth deity, Ana. <b>Before</b> <b>doing</b> so, Nri was ordered to mark ichi onto their two foreheads. Coco yam, a crop managed by females, sprang from his daughter's head, and yam, the Igbo peoples' staple crop, sprung from his son's head; Chukwu had taught Nri plant domestication. From this, the eze Nri's first son and daughter were required to undergo scarification's seven days after birth, with the eze Nri's daughter being the only female to receive ichi. Nri, the son of Eri, also gained knowledge of the yam medicine (ogwu ji). People from other Igbo communities made pilgrimages to Nri in order to receive this knowledge received in exchange for annual tributes.|$|E

5|$|The 5th Marquess of Bute, another John, {{succeeded in}} 1947 and, in 1950, {{he placed the}} castle {{in the care of}} the Ministry of Works. The Marquess also {{disposed}} of Cardiff Castle, which he gave to the city, removing the family portraits from the castle <b>before</b> <b>doing</b> so. In turn, the paintings in Castell Coch were removed by the ministry and sent to Cardiff, the National Museum of Wales providing alternatives from their collection for Castell Coch. Academic interest in the property grew, with publications in the 1950s and 1960s exploring its artistic and architectural value. Since 1984, the property has been administered by Cadw, an agency of the Welsh Government, and is open to the public; it received 69,466 visitors in 2011.

5|$|Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) mind flashes back {{to being}} in the attic with his sister Samantha while their parents are arguing downstairs. Back in the present, Mulder awakens {{in a hotel room}} in Providence, Rhode Island, covered in blood. Mulder calls Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who arrives, finding him in shock. Mulder has a {{pounding}} headache and has no memory of what he has done in the past two days. Scully finds that two bullets have been fired from Mulder's gun and that he has keys belonging to a David and Amy Cassandra. Scully wants Mulder to check into a hospital, but he wants to find out if he was involved in a crime <b>before</b> <b>doing</b> so. The agents arrive at the Cassandra's house where the housekeeper tells them they are not at home. Mulder recognizes a house in many of Cassandra's paintings: a house that is near his parent's summer home in Rhode Island. When they arrive there, Mulder has striking pains in his head and flashes back again to when he was a child, seeing a younger version of The Smoking Man (Chris Owens) in his home. The agents enter the home, where they find the Cassandras dead from gunshot wounds.|$|E
5|$|In Macau, {{three men}} {{break into a}} house, shoot a French woman (Sylvie Testud) and kill {{her husband and two}} children. The woman's father, Francis Costello (Johnny Hallyday), arrives to visit his {{daughter}} who is now suffering from serious injuries. She is nevertheless able to tell her father that there were three shooters and that she shot one of the killers in the ear. At a hotel, Costello meets Kwai (Anthony Wong), Chu (Lam Ka-Tung) and Fat Lok (Lam Suet), a trio of hitmen who are hired to murder the unfaithful wife of Triad crime boss George Fung (Simon Yam). After overhearing the murder in a hotel room, Costello reaches an unspoken agreement to walk away. Costello later tracks down Kwai's syndicate, hands them a stack of euros and his watch, and asks them to help him avenge his daughter's family's deaths. <b>Before</b> <b>doing</b> so though, he takes a Polaroid picture of each of the hitmen, and writes their names on the pictures so that he will not forget who they are. The four go to the apartment where the shooting occurred and work out what happened, the number of shooters and the weapons used.|$|E

He had Washbrook caught behind for eight in his fourth over. Hutton then played outside a Johnson off break and was bowled for 20 to leave England at 32/2. Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich <b>before</b> <b>doing</b> the same to Dollery for a duck two balls later. England were 46/4 and Australia were firmly in control. Compton was joined by his skipper Yardley and the pair rebuilt the innings, scoring 87 runs together in 100 minutes. After the tea break, Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball. Compton edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller took a low catch, dismissing him for 53. One run later, Lindwall clipped Yardley's off stump with the first ball of the over to leave England at 134/6 with their skipper dismissed for 44. Johnson then removed Evans for nine, before Coxon and Laker put on a 41-run stand for the eight wicket. After 85 minutes of resistance, Coxon hit a catch back to Johnson and Laker was caught behind from the same bowler, having already been dropped twice. England's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 9/207.|$|E
5|$|On July 22 the North Koreans attacked. The ROK troops {{resisted}} briefly, but {{withdrew from}} {{their positions on}} either side of F Company without communicating their intentions. The withdrawal had {{been a part of the}} plan for reorganizing the line to incorporate the US troops, but F Company expected them to send a message <b>before</b> <b>doing</b> so, and did not adjust their defenses to compensate. North Korean troops quickly flanked F Company and began attacking it from the rear. This precipitated an unorganized withdrawal. The swollen stream prevented F Company from crossing to the south side and the 2nd Battalion positions. Walking wounded crowded along the stream where an effort to get them across failed. Two officers and two noncommissioned officers tied a pair of twisted telephone wires about their bodies and tried to swim to the other bank and fasten a line, but each in turn was swept downstream where they floundered ashore on the same bank where they had started. Some men drowned trying to cross the swollen river. The covering fire of a platoon of tanks on the south side held off the North Koreans and allowed most of the survivors to eventually escape. F Company lost 37 men: 6 killed, 10 wounded, and 21 missing.|$|E
5|$|Through {{much of the}} Middle Ages and Renaissance the Catholic Church {{had only}} a small number of {{cardinals}} at any one time, down to as few as seven under either Pope Alexander IV (1254-1261) or Pope John XXI (1276-1277). Difficult travel further reduced the number arriving at conclaves. With a small electorate an individual vote was significant, and was not easily shaken from familial or political lines. Conclaves could last months and even years. In addition to the decree in 1274 that the electors should be locked in seclusion, Gregory X also limited each cardinal elector to two servants, and rationed their food progressively on the fourth and ninth days should they fail to elect a new pope. The cardinals disliked these strict rules of the conclave; Pope Adrian V temporarily suspended them in 1276 and John XXI's Licet felicis recordationis formally revoked them later that same year - both these Popes had intended to promulgate a new constitution governing papal elections, but died <b>before</b> <b>doing</b> so. Lengthy elections resumed and continued to be the norm until 1294, when a Benedictine hermit was elected as Pope Celestine V. Celestine reinstated the strict conclave, but soon resigned the papacy. Long interregna occurred after the reinstatement of the conclave: in 1314–1316 during the Avignon Papacy, where the original conclaves were dispersed by besieging mercenaries and not reconvened until almost two years had passed; and in 1415–1417, as a result of the Western Schism.|$|E
