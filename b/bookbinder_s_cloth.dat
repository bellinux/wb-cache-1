40|$|Abstract. Sadum {{is one of}} the {{traditional}} cloths of the Batak people in North Sumatra. It is woven on a back strap loom with supplementary weft technique. Sadum is a warp faced weaving made of cotton and beads woven into the cloth. Ritually it is used as a shoulder cloth, gifts exchanges, and in dances. It also bears the symbol of good tidings and blessings for the receiver. The cloth has change during times in technique, color, patterns, as well as in functions. But the use as a ritual cloth stays the same. The basic weaving techniques and equipments used to create it hasn’t change, but its material and added techniques has made this cloth become more rich in color, pattern, and texture. Most changes began when the Europeans came to Indonesia and introduced new material such as synthetic fibers and colors. In the 70 <b>s</b> traditional <b>cloth</b> of Indonesia got its boost when the government declared batik as Indonesian national attire. This encourages other traditional weavings to develop into contemporary clothing. Later, new techniques and material were introduced to the Sadum weavings including embroidery, silk and golden threads which were never used before...|$|R
40|$|My {{original}} {{desire to}} study an urban center which still produced elaborate handmade textiles {{was to provide}} some possible clues to more seriously consider the practical side of historic production. In other words, what were the physical concerns and limitations of cloth production. In the end I learned that textiles often function in a very complex, multidimensional form and cannot be truly understood without considering many facets of the society which produced them. Conversely, in societies where textiles are highly valued, their study can add much to understanding everything from cultural values, economics and technology to international politics. In addition to the obvious subject of this paper, handweaving in everyday life of artisans, merchants and consumers in Fez, my object in this presentation is twofold. First I would like to help form {{a better understanding of}} the degree of specialization and complexity of cloth in a society which has traditionally depended upon handwoven production. Secondly I would like to provide a basic knowledge, a certain degree of comfort, and thus an appreciation about drawlooms and the fabrics produced by them. The means I have chosen to achieve this two point agenda is to introduce three weaving workshops which were active in the late 19802 ̆ 7 s in the old city of Fez, Morocco, noting the physical surroundings and learning of the weavers 2 ̆ 7 training as well as their business concerns. We will conclude our exposure in the textile showroom of an old, well established crafts family that has successfully made the transition to industrial production while still maintaining much of the essence of the Moroccan cloth tradition. As noted in the foregoing papers presented on this panel, Fez is an urban center which has long been associated with cloth production. During the 14 th century when it was considered second only to Cairo in the Moslem world, Ibn Abi Zar 1 a contemporary writer cites documents that indicate that as early as the 12 century the city already had over 3, 000 looms while a 16 th century account, written shortly after the Andulian migration, states that there were 20, 000 textile workers in the city. 2 Even today when most of the world 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cloth</b> is produced industrially the Handweavers Cooperative Association, a government sponsored organization supporting commercial handwoven production has a sizeable membership.

Fifty ceramic bars (2. 0 x 3. 0 x 2. 5 mm) were produced and randomly divided into five groups (n= 10), according to surface treatments: C: Control; Cer: Ceramaster (60 s); CW: cloth wheel with large-grit diamond (30 <b>s)</b> + <b>cloth</b> wheel with fine-grit diamond paste (30 s); E: grey Exa-Cerapol (20 s) + pink Exa-Cerapol (20 s) + Cerapol Super (20 s); F: Felt wheel with large-grit diamond paste (30 s) + Felt wheel with fine-grit diamond paste (30 s). The samples were evaluated quantitatively for surface roughness (Ra) and qualitatively by SEM, at different moments: initial (prior to roughening), after roughening and after polishing procedures. Ra means were submitted to two-way ANOVA and Tukey test (p< 0. 05). After the different polishing protocols, no statistically significant differences were observed between the Cer and E groups (p= 0. 6347), E and CW groups (p= 0. 1366), and CW and FW groups (p= 0. 5433). Comparing different stages in the same group, it was possible to observe that CW (p< 0. 0001) and FW groups (p< 0. 0001) showed significant differences. SEM analysis revealed that both Cer and E groups exhibited a surface morphological pattern similar to that of control group.

40|$|The paper's {{thesis is}} that the chief causes for the {{well-known}} `industrial crisis' of the traditional English textile towns during the period c. 1290 - c. 1340 was not the emergence of supposedly superior, lower-cost rural competition, as is generally supposed, but rather a far-reaching economic crisis that was afflicting their major cloth markets, those in the Mediterranean basin; and furthermore, that during this same era {{almost all of the}} textile towns, small and large, in northern France and the Low Countries were then experiencing an almost identical crisis. Most of these northern textile producers had been sending the bulk of their exports as price-takers', in the form of cheap, coarse, light, undifferentiated textiles, to the Mediterranean, where warm climates, mass urban markets, and [...] during the 12 th and 13 th centuries [...] low transaction costs had made such exports from north-west Europe profitable. From the 1290 s, however, the entire Mediterranean basin and much of wester Europe were beset with incessant, spreading warfare, piracy, and political instability, which cumulatively led to rising taxes, transport, and marketing costs, while disrupting and contracting markets; by the 1320 s transaction costs had risen to such a high level that northern producers could no longer profit from sending send cheap textiles over such long and hazardous routes to what had become saturated Mediterranean markets. For reasons explored elsewhere, by the 1340 s, some Flemish and Brabantine towns had adjusted to this crisis by shifting production, as `price-makers', to very high-priced highly differentiated luxury woollens, which could better bear these rising transaction costs. From the 1360 <b>s,</b> English <b>cloth</b> manufacturers pursued this same route, while enjoying a virtual monopoly on very high quality wools, and the protection of high export taxes on those wools to overseas competitors producing luxury woollens. In this era production from the now revived and expanding Englishcloth industry was in fact still much more urban than rural. The more pronounced though still gradual shift to rural cloth making took place in the following century, for reasons {{beyond the scope of this}} paper. ...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{cleaning}} and sanitizing of food preparation sites {{is important because}} pathogens are readily spread to food contact surfaces after preparation of contaminated raw products. Tolerance of Salmonella Enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus to surface cleaning by wiping with regular, microfiber, and antibacterial-treated cloths was investigated. Wiping with cleaning cloths resulted in a considerable reduction of microorganisms from surfaces, despite the greater difficulty in removing S. aureus than Salmonella Enteritidis. Depending on the <b>cloth</b> type, <b>S.</b> aureus were reduced on surfaces from initial numbers of approximately 105 CFU/ 100 cm 2 to numbers from less than 4 CFU/ 100 cm 2 (below the detection limit) to 100 CFU/ 100 cm 2. Directly after the cloths were used to clean the contaminated surfaces, they contained high numbers of bacteria (104 to 105 CFU/ 100 cm 2), except for the disposable antibacterial-treated cloths, in which no bacteria could be detected. The tolerance of these pathogens to sodium hypochlorite was studied in the suspension test and in <b>cloths.</b> <b>S.</b> aureus showed a better tolerance for sodium hypochlorite than Salmonella Enteritidis. Inactivation of microorganisms in cloths required a higher concentration of sodium hypochlorite than was needed in the suspension test. Repeated exposure to sodium hypochlorite, however, resulted {{in an increase in}} susceptibility to this compound. This study provides essential information about the transfer of bacteria when wiping surfaces and highlights the need for a hygiene procedure with cleaning cloths that sufficiently avoids cross-contamination in the household environment...|$|R

40|$|Illness {{resulting}} from consumption of contaminated {{food is a}} continuous serious public health problem in the world. A proportion of this foodborne disease is attributable to improper preparation practices in the home, including cross-contamination. Salmonella, Campylobacter and Staphylococcus aureus survive on stainless steel surfaces for hours or days, depending on the species, initial counts {{and the presence of}} food residues. Following a single contamination and air-drying at room temperatures, pathogenic bacteria also remain on cleaning sponges for days, with or without the presence of food residues. The exposure to low water activity surfaces induces filamentation of Salmonella cells, some of which reach a size of 50 µm or more. Filamentous cells maintain their membrane integrity for days on these surfaces and are able to split in single cells under favourable conditions, resulting in the instantaneous appearance {{of a large number of}} viable cells. Considering the common practice of surface cleaning, wiping countertops and other kitchen surfaces reduces microbial counts considerably, particularly when a clean cloth or an antibacterial-impregnated napkin is used. On the contrary, when the cloths are damp and contain high numbers of microorganisms, bacteria are readily spread from the cloths to the surfaces instead of removing bacteria from the surfaces. Pathogenic bacteria survive the treatments with antibacterial dishwashing liquid in sponges. Furthermore, to reduce the count numbers of Salmonella and <b>S.</b> aureus in <b>cloths</b> a higher concentration of household bleach is needed than that in a suspension. Presence of food debris in the cloths, which occurs regularly in practical situations, decreases the effectiveness of antibacterial compounds or disinfectants. Therefore, other measures, such as heating, i. e. immersing in boiling water or washing by a dishwash or laundry cycle with detergents at > 60 o C is suggested to reduce bacterial contamination in cloths. A quantitative analysis on cross-contamination of Salmonella and Campylobacter from contaminated chicken carcass to salad via kitchen surfaces has shown that it is realistic to expect that a proportion of the human exposure to, particularly, Campylobacter originates from cross-contamination in private kitchens during food handling. The probability that salads become contaminated with Campylobacter is higher than that with Salmonella since the prevalence and the levels of Campylobacter on chicken carcass are higher than that of Salmonella. As foodborne disease occurrence continues over time, prevention and control measures must be managed on a continuous basis. Each individual contributes a critical role in preventing and controlling illness. Basic personal and kitchen hygiene can greatly help to defend against harmful microorganisms...|$|R
