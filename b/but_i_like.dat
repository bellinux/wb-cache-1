However, in September 2010, she ruled out a return, saying, [...] "It was a bit selfish of me but I didn't want to be killed off. I am never going to go back <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to think that 's still out there somewhere." [...] At the recording of the new series of The Rob Brydon Show for BBC Two, Brydon asked if she would consider returning, to which Windsor replied, [...] "Never say never".|$|E
500|$|But FIG also {{received}} positive reactions from {{both men and}} women at concerts. Nicols recalled the [...] "dykes" [...] in the audience who had come to see them at FIG's first performance: they were into disco and soul and sat patiently through the other improvisers, but when FIG came on, [...] "They laughed their heads off." [...] A review in the improvised music magazine Musics said that FIG's set [...] "was a welcome contrast to the previous performances [...] which had been singularly humourless." [...] Lindsay Cooper recalled a comment made to her by a female artist working in film: [...] "I don't know what on earth you're doing <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> it." ...|$|E

500|$|According to his colleagues, Hillenburg is [...] "a perfectionist workaholic". He is {{also known}} for his private nature. Julia Pistor, co-producer of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, noted that Hillenburg is [...] "very shy". She went on to say, [...] "He doesn't {{want people to know}} about his life or family. He's just a really funny, down-to-earth guy with a dry sense of humor who puts his family first and keeps us on our toes in keeping our {{corporate}} integrity." [...] Hillenburg said about himself, [...] "I make animation because I like to draw and create things. I have no real interest to be on camera or to be a celebrity. It's not that I don't like people, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> having my privacy." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert insisted, against Atlantic Records' initial wishes, {{that he and}} Dean {{produce the}} album together. This freed the band from the {{constraints}} of any outside producer's schedule. The recording process could then be intertwined with tour dates, which, Dean said, resulted in improved performances on the record. Dean admitted they had been spoiled by working with producer Brendan O'Brien on previous releases. [...] "I'm not so good at walking around the control room with a pen and clipboard in my hands, marking down what takes are the best. It's a lot of work. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> being the very best I can be, and when you're producing, you are taking on everyone's performances and wanting {{it to be the}} best it can be." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{complete}} the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and vocalist Joe Duplantier of Gojira. Rizzo was his choice because, according to Max, he and Rizzo [...] "play together in Soulfly and musically {{we are like}} twin brothers". Max {{also said that he}} talked to Rizzo about going back to the roots of the mid-1980s thrash metal, which he did with Sepultura. Max continues, [...] "Marc was completely into it and he did great. He surpassed what I asked him to do." [...] Max stated that Duplantier was Gloria's idea, as he did not know him at all. He added, [...] "We had no idea who the guy is, he's from a different continent and we don't speak French. I did know the Gojira CD. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the element of surprise and danger Joe brought." ...|$|E
500|$|Michaels accused Al Davis {{of getting}} the {{officials}} to inspect Turner's kicking shoes before a field goal attempt {{to see if they}} contained illegal metal plates, and called the Oakland team official [...] "a man who has never contributed anything to football", to which Davis responded, [...] "It's utterly ridiculous, unbelievable. It seems the Jets always lose to us because of penalties. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> them and don't want any feud in case we visit New York December 29 [...] ". The Jets left their white road uniforms in Oakland to be laundered and sent to them in San Diego, where they were to play their next game. The uniforms were not seen again once the team removed them in the Oakland locker room, and Jets management hastily ordered the green home uniforms, as well as the white uniforms the team had worn in the preseason, to be shipped from New York.|$|E
500|$|Despite Ice-T's {{attempts}} to differentiate Body Count {{from his work}} in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image. Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as rap to provoke negative criticism. [...] "There is absolutely no way to listen to the song 'Cop Killer' and call it a rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word rap they can get {{a lot of people who}} think, 'Rap-black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it. You say the word rock, people say, 'Oh, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> Jefferson Airplane, I like Fleetwood Mac — that's rock.' They don't want to use the word rock & roll to describe this song." [...] Body Count has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, although Ice-T does not rap on any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that [...] "A lot of rappers want to be in a rock band, but it has to be done sincerely. You can't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work. [...] really loved the music we were doing, and it showed." ...|$|E

500|$|Heskey {{played as}} a forward, being a {{powerful}} targetman gifted with pace and physical strength; {{he is also}} a hard working player. His play has been likened to [...] "a blunt instrument with which to bludgeon defences". His main contributions to the team lie in the way he holds the ball up and draws defenders out, leaving space behind him for another player to score. He has been credited as being an unselfish player who allows other forwards to benefit. He is not a prolific goalscorer but is able to provide a significant number of assists as a second striker. He has been quoted as saying [...] "Forwards are judged on their goalscoring. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> to think I bring a lot more to the game and I do get pleasure from assisting". He impressed the England staff with his versatility, as he can also play down the left wing. However, he has been criticised by the media for his lack of goals; lapses in his goalscoring have been described as being [...] "hardly uncommon". In 2008 it was stated that [...] "It is only the perception of his talents that changes" [...] after Heskey stated he was no better or worse than before.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} by Anime News Network, {{reviewer}} Gabriella Ekens praised the series for [...] "sculpting singular, evocative moments", but {{went on to}} say that a [...] "problem arises when you try to tie them into a bigger picture." [...] Ekens criticized the pacing and structure of the show, calling it an [...] "inefficient...collection of sprawling narrative ideas" [...] and comparing it to [...] " [...] suddenly turn into Darker than Black." [...] Ekens also notes that its thematic purpose [...] "seems to be Jun Maeda's opportunity for melodramatic elaboration on the emotional dilemmas posed by Madoka Magica." [...] Overall, Charlotte was lauded for its entertainment value and unpredictability, but [...] "disappoints as a work of art." [...] Early on, Ekens described the series as having [...] "sharp comedic timing," [...] and by episode four, she praised the comedic elements as [...] "already much funnier than Plastic Memories." [...] She {{went on to say}} that [...] "it's dumb, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> it for the same reasons I liked the comedy in [...]" [...] Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post found Charlotte unpredictability [...] "engaging" [...] and its animation [...] "beautiful". Ekens praised P.A. Works for their dynamic direction and [...] "expressive cinematography" [...] which offers [...] "a distinct, pleasant aesthetic." ...|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Meades ate at The Restaurant for The Times in late 1993, {{and noted}} the {{evolution}} of some dishes and sauces from White's days at Harveys. These included making the pig's trotter dish more [...] "delicate", and only using the white part of the leeks in a pressed leek and langoustine starter. Meades also noticed that White had [...] "tempered" [...] the sauces served with meat and fish, referring to their previous versions as [...] "assault courses". He praised a new roasted salmon and tapenade dish, calling it [...] "of breathtaking quality", {{and the work of}} pastry chef Roger Pizey. Meades later listed The Restaurant as the second best in the country at the end of 1994, placed only behind Phil Vickery, having recently taken over from Gary Rhodes, at the Castle Hotel, Taunton. He gave both restaurants an equal nine stars out of ten. When celebrity chef Keith Floyd listed his five favourite restaurants for The Guardian in September 1994, he included The Restaurant in third place, saying [...] "The food is exquisite. He's a difficult bastard, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> him. He came through le Gavroche, through Albert Roux, and he's developed on from there. Along with Albert, I think he's one of the finest cooks in the country. Last time, I had a bean and langoustine soup which was sensational, outstanding." ...|$|E

500|$|Mucho Macho Man first raced at Calder Race Course. [...] He was {{scratched}} by {{the track}} veterinarian {{from the first}} race into which he was entered; he had been slightly injured when the horse next to him reared and flipped over in the starting gate. He was entered in another race a week later, a maiden race in which he finished second, losing to a colt named Gourmet Dinner. After that race, Mucho Macho Man was purchased by Reeves Thoroughbred Racing. [...] Dean and Patti Reeves had considered purchasing Gourmet Dinner, but Dean Reeves recalled saying at the time, [...] "Call me crazy, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> the second horse." [...] After the sale, Tim Ritvo took over the training of Mucho Macho Man from his original trainer, Bill White. The colt came in third at his next race, at Saratoga in New York state; {{he won his first}} race on September19, 2010, at Monmouth Park in New Jersey. After that race, the colt's training was turned over to Kathy Ritvo when Tim began working for Gulfstream Park. In November 2010, Mucho Macho Man moved up to graded class and finished second behind To Honor and Serve twice in a row at Aqueduct Racetrack in New York City, first in the Nashua Stakes and then in the Remsen Stakes. Throughout his two-year-old year the young horse was easily distracted, so he raced with blinkers for both White and Ritvo.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Stefani {{modified}} her image, {{inspired by}} that of Michelle Pfeiffer's character Elvira Hancock in the 1983 film Scarface. The reinvented image included a symbol consisting of two back-to-back 'G's, which appears on a diamond-encrusted key she wears on a necklace and which became a motif in the promotion of The Sweet Escape. Stefani raised concerns in January 2007 about her rapid weight loss following her pregnancy. She later stated {{that she had been}} on a diet since the sixth grade to fit in size 4 clothing, commenting, [...] "It's an ongoing battle and it's a nightmare. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> clothes too much, and I always wanted to wear the outfits I would make." [...] A wax figure of Stefani was unveiled at Madame Tussauds Las Vegas at The Venetian on September 22, 2010. The release of Stefani's first solo album brought attention to her entourage of four Harajuku Girls, who appear in outfits influenced by Gothic Lolita fashion, and are named for the area around the Harajuku Station of Tokyo, Japan. Stefani's clothing also took influence from Japanese fashion, in a style described as a combination between Christian Dior and Japan. The dancers are featured in her music videos, press coverage, and on the album cover for Love. Angel. Music. Baby., with a song named for and dedicated to them on the album. They were also featured in, and the namesake for, Stefani's Harajuku Lovers Tour. Forbes magazine reported Stefani's earnings in 2008, calculating that she earned $27million between June 2007 to June 2008 for her tour, fashion line and commercials, making her the world's 10th highest paid music personality at the time.|$|E

It's a really quick record, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> that element to it. I like the sparseness of the songs and the way that Brendan pulled us together and made us play as good as we could." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that [...] "prior to Backspacer, Pearl Jam wouldn't or couldn't have made music this unfettered, unapologetically assured, casual, and, yes, fun." [...] Vedder stated, [...] "The new record feels good so far—really strong and uptempo, stuff we can sink our teeth into", and added that the band's live performances inspired the album's sound: [...] "At one of our gigs, without flashpots and electricity, there's only so much room for those difficult listening songs. That's one reason we kept the arrangements lean." [...] The singer cited Guided by Voices as a reference in creating the shorter and faster songs of Backspacer. Gossard said that Backspacer is [...] "what we could have done for the last five records, in terms of re-engaging with the roots of why this band works", and that [...] "there's plenty of ballads, too... and there's some shifts in how Jeff and Matt and I are all relating—I think this record's got a chance to sound significantly different." [...] Ament said, [...] "There's a couple of great things that Ed brought in that could be real departures for us. Whatever wave Ed caught with [...] Into the Wild has taken him to different places." ...|$|E
