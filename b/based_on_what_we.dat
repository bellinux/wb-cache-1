40|$|A self-regulatory {{framework}} for distinguishing between shame and guilt was tested in three studies. Recently, {{two forms of}} moral regulation <b>based</b> <b>on</b> approach versus avoidance motivation have been proposed in the literature. Proscriptive regulation is sensitive to negative outcomes, inhibition <b>based,</b> and focused <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> should not do. Prescriptive regulation is sensitive to positive outcomes, activation <b>based,</b> and focused <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> should do. In the current research, consistent support was found for shame’s proscriptive and guilt’s prescriptive moral underpinnings. Study 1 found a positive association between avoidance orientation and shame proneness and between approach orientation and guilt proneness. In Study 2, priming a proscriptive orientation increased shame and priming a prescriptive orientation increased guilt. In Study 3, transgressions most apt to represent proscriptive and prescriptive violations predicted subsequent judgments of shame and guilt, respectively.

40|$|The paper {{argues that}} the {{functional}} approach of money {{does not provide a}} good method to study monetary history and monetary mechanisms. An alternative approach is developed and illustrated by analyzing the role of tobacco and cowry shells in past monetary systems. It is shown that any monetary system has specific properties that most students of money do not take into account when theorizing about money or analyzing its history. This leads them to miss some important points, and to see monetary systems where none exist. Hence, one can doubt some of the past research on the subject, at least until further investigation is conducted that is <b>based,</b> not <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> think "money" is, but <b>on</b> <b>what</b> its essential properties are.

40|$|Debugging {{programs}} {{written in}} lazy functional languages is difficult, {{and there are}} currently no realistic, general purpose debugging tools available. The basic problem is that computations in general do not {{take place in the}} order one might expect. Furthermore, lazy functional languages are `declarative'. Hence it is advantageous if debugging takes place at the same, high level of abstraction. Thus, we propose to <b>base</b> debugging <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> call Evaluation Dependence Trees (EDT), which reflect the declarative semantics of the programs rather than operational concerns such as evaluation order. This in turn naturally suggests a two level debugger architecture where the lower level generates the EDT and the upper level allows the user to investigate it. The main advantage of this is flexibility: components realizing the two levels may be chosen independently to suit the debugging problem at hand. 1 Introduction For various reasons, as will be explained in the following, debugging progra [...] ...|$|R

This approach depends on Web cookies to identify, at checkout time, which affiliate should receive a commission.

This paper provides a measurement-based characterization of cookie-stuffing fraud in online affiliate marketing.

30|$|A known {{problem of}} the {{watershed}} method is over-segmentation. The presence of {{a huge number of}} local minima - for example due to random particle noise or transient gas density fluctuations - causes segmentation into as many catchment basins as there are local minima. Generally speaking, there are two possible strategies to deal with this problem: not creating the over-segmentation in the first place or merging over-segmented regions. Preventing over-segmentation the can be obtained using markers to preselect allowed minima (e.g., Moga and Gabbouj 1998). This usually requires a human intervention, which in our case is not possible. Another way is to use the so-called hierarchical watershed algorithm 3 (Beucher 1994).

The already deployed Wi-Fi devices can also serve as reference points for localization eliminating the cost of setting up a dedicated system. However, {{the primary purpose of}} these Wi-Fi systems is data communication and not providing location services. Thus their positioning accuracy might be insufficient. This accuracy can be increased by carefully placing the Wi-Fi access points to cover the given territory properly.
