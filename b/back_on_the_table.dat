25|$|The FY2008 French defence budget {{included}} the necessary funding, €3 billion, for the ship. However, in April 2008 French Defence Minister Herve Morin cast doubt over {{plans for a}} second aircraft carrier, citing a cash crunch {{and the fact that}} rising oil prices put the question of the propulsion <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and said a decision would be taken soon. Further doubts were cast on the project on 21 June 2008 when then French President Nicolas Sarkozy decided to suspend co-operation with Britain on the aircraft carrier. Sarkozy stated that a final decision on France building a second carrier would be taken by 2012.|$|E
25|$|Designs {{initially}} {{considered for}} the various MOTS routes included the German-designed Type 214, Japan's Sōryū-class, the French-designed Scorpène class, the Spanish S-80 class, and an evolved Collins-class. The Spanish S-80 class was dropped from consideration due to serious design issues that had been noted in the public domain. An evolved Collins class design was also considered in 2013 but was officially dropped from consideration in 2015, due to it being assessed that the work required equated to composing a brand new design. In addition, Saab pushed an enlarged variant of its Swedish A26 submarine, but was excluded from further consideration in February 2015 due to Sweden having not designed and built a submarine independently for twenty years. Pure MOTS submarines were initially ruled out by the project in March 2011, but were put <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> in December 2011.|$|E

For this purpose both nations organized themselves together with Brazil and India to form the so-called [...] "G4 nations". On 21 September 2004, the G4 issued a joint statement mutually backing each other's claim to permanent seats, together with two African countries. This proposal has found opposition in a group of countries called Uniting for Consensus.

Although the PEF executive board voted to recommend the contract to PEF's members, those who voted [...] "no" [...] on the pact argued that PEF had achieved less than other unions, that the deal traded concessions for pay increases, and that the money spent on Kheel's consulting contract had gotten the union nothing better than what had been offered months before. [...] The board meeting was a raucous one, with alleged physical confrontations, a [...] "Dump Shafer" [...] movement hanging banners near the entrance, rumors of decertification, and proposals for PEF to abandon its independence and join either SEIU or AFT.

40|$|AbstractTraction {{therapy is}} a common and {{effective}} non-surgical treatment of low back pain caused by degenerated or herniated intervertebral disc or other disc deformities. While lying on specially designed treatment <b>tables</b> and fixated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pelvis, axial traction {{is applied to the}} patient's spine to separate the vertebrae and release pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> disc. Targeted traction of specific segments instead of pulling the whole spine can increase the efficacy of the traction therapy and reduces side effects due to less application of traction force. This paper presents a design approach of a traction <b>table,</b> which allows <b>the</b> targeted and accurate repeatable treatment of any specific intervertebral disc. Furthermore the treatment of malformations like scoliosis is possible due to the special design of <b>the</b> traction <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> automated measuring of <b>the</b> patient's <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> traction <b>table</b> enables <b>the</b> accurate and effective resp. ergonomic treatment of the patient by the comparison of MRI images and the measured spine shape...|$|R
