5|$|Around 1919 the <b>basement</b> {{was first}} leased to a pool hall, “Dad’s Billiard Room”. While this {{business}} {{was not present}} in 1920, the <b>basement</b> would house a pool hall continuously from 1927 into the 1970s.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{problems}} under consideration is the feasibility of constructing <b>basements</b> at the new site of Aklavik. Technically {{there appear to be}} many difficulties in the construction of <b>basements</b> that will perform well in permafrost areas where the soil is subject to settlement on thawing. These technical difficulties tend to make the construction of <b>basements</b> uneconomical. In practice, relatively few <b>basements</b> have been built in such areas and there is virtually no published material on the performance of <b>basements</b> in permafrost.

25|$|<b>Basements</b> {{also became}} {{available}} {{for the use of}} air raid shelters. <b>Basements</b> under factory premises, schools, hospitals, department stores and other businesses were utilised. However, these ad hoc shelters could bring additional dangers, as heavy machinery and materials or water storage facilities above the shelter, and insufficient support structures threatened to cause the collapse of <b>basements.</b>|$|R

5|$|Based on outcrop analysis, the {{crystalline}} <b>basement</b> {{composed of}} granitic and monzonitic rocks, {{dates to the}} Cretaceous, the oldest dated sample being 91.2 ± 2 million years old. This rock, a granite, {{may be part of}} a plutonic <b>basement.</b> Younger <b>basement</b> rocks comprise Miocene marine sediments and volcanics pertaining to the Comondú Group. Andesite of Sierra Santa Lucía is found west-southwest of the Santa Rosalía Basin. The basaltic La Esperanza formation is also in the area.|$|E
5|$|East of {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} was a two-storey building with a <b>basement.</b> The <b>basement</b> was probably used for storage while the above two floors provided accommodation. The purpose of the buildings along {{the west end of}} the north range is uncertain. The sparse arrangement, with little provision for lighting, has led to suggestions that it was used as stables, however there are no drains which are usually associated with stables. The tower in the northwest corner of the castle had a garderobe and fireplace on each of the three above-ground floors, and there was a <b>basement</b> underneath.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a {{virtually}} complete collection {{of all of}} Dylan's 1967 recordings in Woodstock was released on a bootleg five-CD set, The Genuine <b>Basement</b> Tapes. The collection, which contains over 100 songs and alternate takes, was later remastered and issued as the four-CD bootleg A Tree With Roots. On November 4, 2014, Columbia/Legacy issued , an official 6-CD box set containing 139 tracks which comprises nearly all of Dylan's <b>basement</b> recordings, including 30 never-bootlegged tracks. A companion 2-CD set containing highlights from the recordings, The <b>Basement</b> Tapes Raw, was also released.|$|E
50|$|In the {{environment}} of these <b>basements</b> {{are two of the}} most important Roman remains found in the city: Roman baths of Toledo and cisterns of the water distribution network of the <b>basements</b> of Delegación de Hacienda.|$|R
50|$|<b>Basements</b> are a {{very common}} feature of houses in Hove: it was {{customary}} for servants to live in them in the Victorian and Edwardian era. According to a Hove Council survey in 1954, 2,573 houses were built with <b>basements.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each of {{the three}} parks belongs {{to one of the}} gravity wells. All but one of the doors seem to lead to <b>basements</b> below the parks. Though {{physically}} possible, such <b>basements</b> are certainly unusual and add to the surreal effect of the picture.|$|R
5|$|The <b>basement</b> {{rooms at}} Wappocomo are located almost entirely aboveground. The house's {{foundation}} is constructed of large stone blocks, into which was crafted a large open fireplace that once exhibited a swinging iron chimney crane. The space around this large open fireplace within the mansion's <b>basement</b> formerly {{served as a}} kitchen, {{where most of the}} cooking and food preparation took place. Entry into the home's <b>basement</b> is accessible through a wide and heavy exterior door.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} terraced {{into the side}} of a mound, so the {{northern}} side of the <b>basement</b> is partially below ground level. As was typical of most keeps, the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior of the <b>basement</b> dates mostly from the 18thcentury when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts. The <b>basement</b> is lit through small slits.|$|E
5|$|They again hear Josh's agonized {{cries for}} help and follow them to a derelict, {{abandoned}} house containing symbols and children's bloody hand-prints on the walls. Mike races upstairs {{in an attempt to}} find Josh while Heather follows. Mike then says he hears Josh in the <b>basement.</b> He runs downstairs while a hysterical Heather struggles to keep up. Upon reaching the <b>basement,</b> something attacks Mike and causes him to drop the camera and go silent. Heather enters the <b>basement</b> screaming, and her camera captures Mike facing a corner. Something then attacks Heather, causing her to drop her camera and go silent as well. The footage continues for another moment and then ends.|$|E
50|$|There was {{no crime}} scene {{investigation}} and no judicial authority {{was allowed to}} enter the <b>basements.</b> Instead the Turkish authorities arranged that the ruins were flattened, the <b>basements</b> filled up with rubble, and bodies were taken away. Therefore, Human Rights Watch suspects a cover-up.|$|R
50|$|By the 1790s only {{a single}} low wall {{remained}} to be seen above ground, and that was at risk of falling. Some workmen employed to underpin this wall discovered the buried castle <b>basements</b> and foundations, which ran off from the wall. Realising the likely extent of these <b>basements,</b> {{and the possibility of}} treasures within, they brought their discovery to the attention of Sir William Jerningham. Jerningham immediately ordered all the foundations and <b>basements</b> to be uncovered, and the whole mound to be cleared of overgrowth.|$|R
40|$|A new law {{approved}} in March 2017 in the Lombardy Region {{makes it possible}} to live in <b>basements.</b> <b>Basements</b> are defined as buildings partly below curb level but with at least one-half of its height above the curb. Basements’ features and structural characteristics might pose risks to human health. In this paper we adopt a multidisciplinary approach to assess the potential health effects of living in <b>basements.</b> In particular, we define a conceptual framework to describe basements’ structural characteristics which are risk factors, as well as the mechanisms through which they impact on human health. We also conduct a systematic review on the scientific databases PubMed,Embase, DOAJ, Proquest and EBSCO to retrieve, pool and critically analyze all available research that quantified the risk of living in <b>basements</b> for different health outcomes. Available evidence suggests living in <b>basements</b> increases the risk of respiratory diseases (asthma and allergic disorders); more heterogeneous data are available for cancers and cardiovascular diseases. As more quantitative data need to be prospectively retrieved to assess and monitor the risk of living in <b>basements</b> for human health, clear minimum requirements for light, air, sanitation and egress are to be defined by technical experts and enforced by policy makers...|$|R
5|$|A young Addie (Katelyn Reed) {{stares up}} at an old mansion when two {{troublesome}} twins Brian and Troy (Kai and Bodhi Schulz) arrive, planning to enter the house. Addie warns them not to enter the house, but they ignore her warning and enter the house anyway. While they wreak havoc, Brian discovers a dying animal and the twins find an open door to the <b>basement.</b> They enter the <b>basement</b> where they find jars containing animal remains and human fetuses. After complaining about the smell, Brian leaves the <b>basement</b> {{only to find that}} his brother has gone silent. He searches for him and finds him with his throat slit, gasping for air. The Infantata (Ben Woolf) appears behind him and kills him off screen.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} guards, there may have been an opportunity for {{one or more of the}} guards to rescue a survivor. Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the <b>basement,</b> and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the <b>basement</b> with the bodies.|$|E
5|$|An {{examination}} of the blood stains found inside 46Lower Belgrave Street demonstrated that Rivett had been attacked in the <b>basement</b> kitchen, while Lady Lucan had been attacked {{at the top of}} the <b>basement</b> stairs. The blood stains found inside the Ford Corsair were of the AB blood group; the report concluded that this might have been a mixture of blood from both women. Hair similar to Lady Lucan's was also found inside the car.|$|E

50|$|Other {{than with}} walk-out or {{look-out}} <b>basements,</b> windows in <b>basements</b> require a well and are below grade. A clear window well cover {{may be required}} to keep the window wells from accumulating rain water. There should be drains in the window well, connected to the foundation drains.|$|R
5|$|An old {{belief is}} that the {{southwest}} corner of a <b>basement</b> provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a <b>basement,</b> under a staircase, or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.|$|E
