40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} compare short-segment {{stabilization}} with long-segment stabilization for treating unstable thoracolumbar fractures, we studied fifty patients suffered from unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures. Thirty {{of them were}} managed with long-segment posterior transpedicular instrumentation and twenty patients with short-segment stabilization. The mean follow up period was 5. 2 years. Pre-operative and post-operative radiological parameters, like the Cobb angle, the kyphotic deformation and the <b>Beck</b> <b>index</b> were evaluated. A statistically {{significant difference between the}} two under study groups was noted for the Cobb angle and the kyphotic deformation, while, as far as the <b>Beck</b> <b>index</b> is concerned, no significant difference was noted. In conclusion, either the long-segment or the short-segment stabilization is able for reducing the segmental kyphosis and the vertebral body deformation postoperatively. However, as time goes by, the long-segment stabilization is associated with better results as far as the radiological parameters, the indexes and the patient’s satisfaction are concerned...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Up to {{one third}} of BKP treated cases shows no appreciable height {{restoration}} due to loss of both restored height and kyphotic realignment after balloon deflation. This shortcoming has called for an improved method that maintains the height and realignment reached by the fully inflated balloon until stabilization of the vertebral body by PMMA-based cementation. Restoration of the physiological vertebral body height for pain relief and for preventing further fractures of adjacent and distant vertebral bodies must be the main aim for such a method. A new vertebral body stenting system (VBS) stabilizes the vertebral body after balloon deflation until cementation. The radiographic and safety results of the first 100 cases where VBS was applied are presented. METHODS During the planning phase of an ongoing international multicenter RCT, radiographic, procedural and followup details were retrospectively transcribed from charts and xrays for developing and testing the case report forms.

40|$|Introduction. Temporo-mandibular {{disorders}} (TMDs) are a {{group of}} chronic and common disease {{that a lot of}} skeletal, Dental and psychologic factors can have an effect on it. Proposed treatment to control this disorder consists of wide variety of drugs and non-drugs methods beside dental treatment. Some investigations have reffered to relation between TMDs and some psychologic factors such as depression. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate affects of relaxation therapy on TMDs. Methods. This was a clinical trial study. The case group consisted of 25 patients with TMDs and an average mark of depression <b>Beck</b> <b>index</b> of 4 / 4. After Beck test, patients were taught relaxation therapy methods. These methods were done until-two weeks. After completion of methods, Beck test was done again and TMD patients were re-enaluated. Results. The average incidence of pain in TMJ (in function and Rest) the maximum opening, maximum protrusive and Lateral movement, deviation of mandible in maximum mouth opening, and Beck test mark before and after relaxation therapy were meaningful and changes showed decrease in TMDs signs. Discussion. Findings show the effect of psychologic factors as an independent etiologic factor or dependent precursor of TMDs. These effects shouldn’t be ignored, therefore the relaxation therapy without any side effects can be a combined method with other methods to increase patients cooperation because of foovering the pain.

This research aims to characterize the sleep problems of patients following acute mTBI. Methods. A total of 171 patients with mTBI within one month and 145 non-mTBI controls were recruited in this study. The questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), was used to evaluate seven aspects of sleep problems. A propensity score method was used to generate a quasirandomized design to account for the background information, including gender, age, <b>Beck’s</b> Anxiety <b>Index,</b> <b>Beck’s</b> Depression <b>Index,</b> and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The effect was evaluated via cumulative logit regression including propensity scores as a covariate. Results.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionThe {{majority}} of osteoporotic, spinal cord compressive, vertebral fractures {{occurs at the}} thoracolumbar junction level. When responsible for neurological impairment, these rare lesions require a decompression procedure. We present {{the results of a}} new option to treat these lesions: an open balloon kyphoplasty associated with a short-segment posterior internal fixation. Materials and methodsTwelve patients, aged a mean 72. 3 years, were included in this prospective series; all of them presented osteoporotic burst fractures located between T 11 and L 2 associated with neurological impairment. The surgical procedure first consisted of a laminectomy, for decompression, followed by an open balloon kyphoplasty. A short-segment posterior internal fixation was subsequently put into place when the local kyphosis was considered severe. A CAT scan study evaluated local vertebral body's height restoration using two pre- and postoperative radiological indices. ResultsAll of the patients in the series were followed up for a mean 14  months. Local kyphosis improved a mean 10. 8 (p< 0. 001). Vertebral body height was also substantially restored, with a mean gain of 26 % according to the anterior height/adjacent height ratio and 28 % according to the <b>Beck</b> <b>Index</b> (p< 0. 001). Two cases of cement leakage were recorded, with no adverse clinical side effect. Complete neurological recovery was observed in 10  patients; two retained a minimal neurological deficit but kept a walking capacity. DiscussionThe results presented in this study confirm the data reported in the literature in terms of local kyphosis correction and vertebral body height restoration. The combination of this technique with laminectomy plus osteosynthesis allowed us to effectively treat burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction and led to stable results 1  year after surgery. This can be advantageous in a population often carrying multiple co-morbidities. With a single operation, we can achieve neurological decompression and spinal column stability in a minimally invasive way; this avoids more substantial surgery in these fragile patients.

40|$|Background: Vertebroplasty (VP) is a {{cost-efficient}} {{alternative to}} kyphoplasty. However, {{it is considered}} inferior {{when it comes to}} maintaining safety and in vertebral body (VB) height restoration. We assess the safety and efficacy of VP in alleviating pain, improving quality of life (QoL), and restoring alignment. Materials and Methods: In a prospective monocenter case series, from April 2007 until July 2008, 1, 422 vertebroplasties were performed, during 307 interventions, in 279 patients with traumatic, lytic, and osteoporotic fractures with 28 repeat interventions, for new fractures after the primary surgery, in 28 patients. The 226 interventions (n= 203 patients) done for osteoporotic fractures were analyzed for demographics, treatment and radiographic details, pain alleviation, QoL improvement [NASS and Euroqol (EQ- 5 D) ] and complications. Results: Osteoporotic patient sample consisted of 77. 8 &#x 0025; (n= 158) females with a median age of 78 years and 45 males who had the same median age. Around 69 &#x 0025; of these patients were ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) grade 3 and above. On an average there were 1. 8 VBs fractured and five VBs treated,whereas the most frequently performed cementations were in six (35. 6 &#x 0025;, n= 80) or five (19. 6 &#x 0025;, n= 44) levels. About 36. 5 &#x 0025;, (n= 414) of the interventions were localized at the thoraco-lumbar junction (Th 12 -L 2). On applying the Genant classification, there was a slight height reduction in 13. 1 &#x 0025; (n= 29), a medium loss in 34. 3 &#x 0025; (n= 78), and a severe loss of height in 52. 6 &#x 0025; (n= 119). The pre-operative pain was assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS) and decreased from 56. 7 to 41. 4 pts after two months. Accordingly, the QoL on the EQ- 5 D measure (0. 6 to 1) improved from 0. 32 pts before surgery to 0. 58 pts after two months. The pre-operative <b>Beck</b> <b>index</b> (anterior height/posterior height) improved from a mean of 0. 66 preoperative to 0. 80 post-operative and remained stable at two months post-operatively. There were cement leakages in 33 &#x 0025; of the fractured VBs and in 0. 8 &#x 0025; of the prophylactically cemented VBs; there were symptoms in 7. 1 &#x 0025;, and most of them were temporary hypotension and one pulmonary cement embolism that remained asymptomatic. Conclusion: If routinely used, VP is a safe and efficient treatment option for osteoporotic vertebral fractures with regard to pain relief and improvement of the QoL. Even segmental re-alignment can be achieved to a certain extent with proper patient positioning...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the predictive outcome factors for a multifaceted rehabilitation program among acute and chronic {{low back pain}} (LBP) patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed on 565 (153 acute and 412 chronic) LBP patients who participated in a multimodal treatment program at an outpatient clinic in Belgium between 2007 to 2010. The predictive value of several factors including age, gender, body mass index, fat percentage, Oswestry Disability <b>Index</b> score, <b>Beck</b> Depression <b>Index</b> score, Numeric Rating Scale score for back and leg pain intensity, and Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia score on favorable treatment outcome was examined using logistic regression analysis. Results: The results from the multivariate regression indicated that a higher score on the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (OR= 0. 92) decreases {{the odds of a}} favorable outcome following a multimodal treatment program in acute LBP. Older age (OR= 0. 97), high LBP intensity (OR= 1. 191), and higher scores on the <b>Beck</b> Depression <b>Index</b> (OR= 0. 96) and the Oswestry LBP Disability Index (OR= 0. 93) decreased the odds for a favorable treatment outcome in chronic LBP. Conclusions: The findings {{of this study indicate that}} predictive factors for (un) favorable treatment outcome differ between acute and chronic LBP. Specifically, the presence of kinesiophobia is predictive for poor treatment outcome in acute LBP. In chronic LBP, older age, low LBP intensity, and higher degrees of depression and LBP related disability levels are predictive for poor treatment outcome. Therefore, therapists should assess these predictive factors at intake to optimize the content of the multimodal treatment program to individual patient needs...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} tested two hypotheses: 1) that lucid dreaming could be {{effectively}} taught through an online intervention, and 2) that lucid dreaming can alleviate depression as mediated by LOC. Surveys consisting of (lucid) dream frequency and recall scales (Schredl and Erlacher, 2004; Doll, Gitter, and Holzinger, 2009), Rotter's LOC scale (1966), {{and the most}} recent <b>Beck</b> Depression <b>Index</b> (BDI-II) were completed by college students. The experimental group was instructed to keep dream diaries throughout the whole study. Two weeks after the preliminary survey they were presented with a lucid dreaming intervention,which instructed them to practice reality checks throughout the day in order to attain lucidity at night. Lucid dreaming frequency was found to be directly correlated with depression (p less then 0. 001). Implications for therapy and suggestions for further research are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Background: Depression {{and anxiety}} have been {{associated}} with a range of symptoms that often overlap. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale- 21 (DASS- 21) is a single instrument to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. This study aimed to adapt and validate the DASS- 21 for use in the Brazilian Portuguese language. Methods: the DASS- 21 has been adapted following the translation-back translation methodology from English to Portuguese. 242 subjects completed the following assessments: the DASS- 21, the <b>Beck</b> Depression <b>Index</b> (BM), <b>Beck</b> Anxiety <b>Index</b> (BAI) and the Inventory of Stress Symptoms of Lipp (ISSL). Results: the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (WO) result was. 949, indicating that the adequacy of the model was high. Cronbach's alpha was. 92 for the depression,. 90 for the stress, and. 86 for the anxiety, indicating a good internal consistency for each subscale. the correlations between DASS scale and BDI scale, BAI scale and ISSL inventory were strong. the factorial analysis and distribution of factors among the subscales indicated that the structure of three distinct factors is adequate. Limitations: Older subjects over 65 years of age were not largely represented in this sample. A study specific to this elderly population should be conducted. Another limitation of the study was education level. the impact of low education in its applicability should be considered. Conclusions: the findings support the validity of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the DASS- 21 and add to the evidence of the DASS- 21 quality and ability to assess emotional states separately, eliminating the use of different instruments to assess these states.

40|$|In three experiments, {{undergraduates}} rated autobiographical memories on scales {{derived from}} existing theories of memory. In multiple regression analyses, {{ratings of the}} degree to which subjects recollected (i. e., relived) their memories were predicted by visual imagery, auditory imagery, and emotions, whereas ratings of belief in the accuracy of their memories were predicted by knowledge of the setting. Recollection was predicted equally well in between- and within-subjects analyses, but belief consistently had smaller correlations and multiple regression predictions between subjects; individual differences in the cognitive scales that we measured could not account well for individual differences in belief. In contrast, measures of mood (<b>Beck</b> Depression <b>Index)</b> and dissociation (Dissociative Experience Scale) added predictive value for belief, but not for recollection. We also found that highly relived memories almost always had strong visual images and that remember/know judgments made on autobiographical memories were more closely related to belief than to recollection...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} having {{a child with a}} DSD including ambiguous external genitalia, as well as the decision of whether or not to have early genitoplasty for that child, on the mental health and parenting characteristics of caregivers. Materials and Methods. Caregivers were recruited from centers that specialize in DSD medicine and completed the Beck Depression Inventory 2 nd Edition (BDI- 2), <b>Beck</b> Anxiety <b>Index</b> (BAI), Parent Protection Scale (PPS), Child Vulnerability Scale (CVS) and Parenting Stress Index/Short Form (PSI/SF). Results and Conclusions. Sixty-eight caregivers provided informed consent and completed the study. Among female caregivers whose children never received genitoplasty, greater parenting stress was reported (F(1, 40) = 5. 08, p =. 03). For male caregivers, those whose children received genitoplasty within the first year of life reported more overprotective parenting and parenting stress than those whose children received genitoplasty later than 12 months of age (F(1, 13) = 6. 16, p = 0. 28); F(1, 15) = 6. 70, p =. 021), respectively) ...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 10 % of cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) cases remain undiagnosed until age 18 or later and medical professionals are still unclear about {{the needs of}} these individuals. Adults with CF iii must either adapt to life with a chronic disease or transition into adulthood with CF. The {{purpose of this study}} was to address the impact of age-at-diagnosis on quality of life in a CF adult population. The psychological functioning of 21 adult CF patients (seven adult-diagnosed (AD) and 14 pediatric-diagnosed (PD)) was assessed using the <b>Beck</b> Depression <b>Index</b> (BDI) -II. A descriptive review of demographic and clinical data, which included an assessment of the financial impact of active outpatient medications, was also conducted among patients in both groups. The incidence of depression among participants was relatively low and appeared independent of age-at-diagnosis. Differences between AD and PD patients with CF in terms of demographic and clinical parameters were also minimal. (96 pages) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} attendance at a clinically based, short-term, in-patient group CBT program largely based on Monti, Abrams, Kadden, and Cooney(1) to treat problem drinking. Participants were 37 males and 34 females diagnosed with alcohol dependence. Patients attended 42 CBT sessions over three weeks, with each session being one hour in duration. Measures included the Khavari Alcohol Test (KAT), the Short Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire (SADD), the <b>Beck</b> Anxiety <b>Index</b> (BAI), the Symptom Checklist- 90 -Revised (SCL- 90), a General Self-Efficacy scale (GSE), and the Drinking Expectancy Profile (DEP). Group attendance rates were monitored daily. Two structured phone calls were conducted at one month and three months post-discharge. Results showed that attendance rates at CBT group sessions were not associated with improvements found {{at the end of}} therapy or in drinking behaviors at three-month follow-up. Full support could not be found for the effectiveness of group CBT and cognitive models of problem drinking...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore how maternal mood during pregnancy, i. e., general anxiety, pregnancy-specific anxiety, and depression predicted parenting stress 3  months after giving birth, thereby shaping the child’s early postnatal environmental circumstances. To this end, data were used from 1073 women participating in the Dutch longitudinal cohort Generations 2, which studies first-time pregnant mothers during pregnancy and across the transition to parenthood. Women filled out the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire-revised (PRAQ-R), and <b>Beck</b> Depression <b>Index</b> (BDI) three times during pregnancy: at 12, 22, and 32  weeks gestational age. Three months postpartum, a parenting stress questionnaire was filled out yielding seven different parenting constructs. Latent scores were computed for each of the repeatedly measured maternal mood variables with Mplus and parenting stress constructs were simultaneously regressed on these latent scores. Results showed that trait anxiety and pregnancy-specific anxiety were uniquely related to almost all parenting stress constructs, taking depression into account. Early prevention and intervention to reduce maternal anxiety in pregnancy could hold the key for a more advantageous trajectory of early postnatal parenting...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Depression unfortunately, {{remains an}} under-recognized and misdiagnosed condition, {{especially}} in the aging population. We aimed to research the relation of depression, LUTS and ED in elderly men. Methods: In this prospective study, 364 elder male patients were evaluated. For depression research in patients, <b>Beck's</b> Depression <b>Index</b> (BDI) was used. Lower urinary tract symptoms of patients were evaluated by International prostatic symptoms score (IPSS) examination form and Erection quality was evaluated with International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF 5 - 15) examination form. According to evaluation results, patients were assigned as Group 0 : Mild LUTS and no ED (IPSS 26), Group 1 : Patients describing only moderate and severe LUTS, Group 2 : Patients describing only ED (IIEF 7 - IIEF< 26). Results: A significant difference was observed between depression states of patients and their LUTS and IIEFs. Depression risk for the Group 3 was monitored to increase by 5. 4 fold (p= 0. 012) according to the Group 0. Conclusions: ED, LUTS and depression are all common conditions that accompany aging and significantly negatively impact quality of life. So this patient group can be treated more successful by a multidisciplinary approach...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{secondary}} benefits of treadmill training {{for people in}} the chronic stage of recovery from stroke. Design: Modified random assignment, matched-pair control group design with repeated measures. Setting: Outpatient stroke centre. Participants: Twenty individuals post first stroke who acknowledged walking slower than pre stroke. Participants matched by side of hemiparesis and motor impairment. Interventions: Twelve 20 -minute sessions of walking on a treadmill or weekly phone call. Main outcome measures: Depression (<b>Beck</b> Depression <b>Index),</b> mobility and social participation (Stroke Impact Scale 3. 0 subscales) were assessed initially, at the end of 12 treatments (four weeks) and six weeks later. Results: No significant difference was found between groups for any dependent measure. The ANOVA to investigate main effects in each group found no significant findings in the control group; however in the treatment group significant improve-ments over time for depression (P 0. 005, P 50. 001), mobility (P 0. 008) and social participation (P 0. 004) were demonstrated. Conclusions: A task-specific intervention designed to improve gait speed may potentially provide secondary benefits by positively impacting depression, mobility and social participation for people post stroke...|$|R
40|$|Objective. As few, small {{studies have}} {{examined}} the impact of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) upon the heart rate variability of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), we sought to confirm whether ECT-associated improvement in depressive symptoms would be associated with increases in HRV linear and nonlinear parameters. Methods. After providing consent, depressed study participants (n = 21) completed the <b>Beck</b> Depression <b>Index</b> (BDI), and 15 -minute Holter monitor recordings, prior to their 1 st and 6 th ECT treatments. Holter recordings were analyzed for certain HRV indices: root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), low-frequency component (LF) /high-frequency component (HF) and short-(SD 1) versus long-term (SD 2) HRV ratios. Results. There {{were no significant differences in}} the HRV indices of RMSDD, LF/HF, and SD 1 /SD 2 between the patients who responded, and those who did not, to ECT. Conclusion. In the short term, there appear to be no significant improvement in HRV in ECT-treated patients whose depressive symptoms respond versus those who do not. Future studies will reveal whether diminished depressive symptoms with ECT are reliably associated with improved sympathetic/parasympathetic balance over the long-term, and whether acute changes in sympathetic/parasympathetic balance predict improved mental- and cardiac-related outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: There is {{extensive}} evidence relating individual behavioral {{risk factors}} to adverse health outcomes and associated costs; however, more-comprehensive assessments have been limited. Our {{objective was to}} examine the relative effects of obesity, alcohol abuse, and smoking on health care use and associated charges. Methods: New adult patients (n= 509) were randomly assigned to primary care physicians, and their utilization of medical services was monitored for 1 year. Variables measured included sociodemographics, self-reported health status, <b>Beck</b> Depression <b>Index,</b> measured body mass index, Michigan Alcohol Screening Test results, and smoking history. Results: Controlling for health status, depression, age, education, income, and gender, obesity was associated with the mean number of primary care visits, diagnostic services, and primary care clinic charges. Alcohol abuse was related to the mean number of emergency department visits and diagnostic services. Smoking was associated with the mean number of specialty clinic visits and hospitalizations. Smoking also predicted charges for emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and total health care charges. Conclusions: The economic burden of smoking is significant, even after only 1 year. Health care providers should focus attention on smoking prevention and cessation programs as an approach for managing medical costs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background: {{religious}} {{attitudes and}} behaviors have significant effects on life meaning. Behaviors such as praying may relax the person via hope. Secure relation to GOD and having goals and meanings in life may be a supportive way in problematic life events, so religious people can handle life stress more effective than others. The aim of current {{study was to explore}} the association between religious attitude and depressive symptoms among undergraduate medical students. Methods: This descriptive-analytical, cross-sectional research was carried out to evaluate the relation between religious attitudes and depression among 750 students of Shiraz University of Medical Science who were selected by stratified sampling method and completed Ghubari religious attitude scale and <b>Beck</b> depression <b>index.</b> Results: descriptive analyses showed that the mean of depression and religious attitude were 9. 03 and 107. 59 respectively. Female participants had significant higher religious attitude than male. Co relational analyses revealed a significant negative correlation between depression and religious attitude among sample (r =- 0. 157). Conclusion: religious attitude could be a protective factor against depression. Applied programs are recommended to reinforce the religious beliefs and convictions among the students...|$|R
