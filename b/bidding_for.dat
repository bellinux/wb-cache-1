5|$|Delhi {{has hosted}} many major {{international}} sporting events, {{including the first}} and also the ninth Asian Games, the 2010 Hockey World Cup, the 2010 Commonwealth Games and the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Delhi lost <b>bidding</b> <b>for</b> the 2014 Asian Games, and considered making a bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics. However, sports minister Manohar Singh Gill later stated that funding infrastructure would come before a 2020 bid. There are indications of a possible 2028 bid.|$|E
5|$|American {{broadcaster}} NBC Sports, {{who also}} owns the broadcast {{rights to the}} Olympics, has been criticised by athletes and IPC officials for airing too little coverage of the Paralympics; the lack of coverage from NBC in Athens was {{a cause for concern}} from senior IPC officials, especially given that the United States was <b>bidding</b> <b>for</b> the 2012 Games. In 2012 NBC only produced around 5 hours of tape delayed highlights from the Games, airing on the pay TV channel NBC Sports Network, and did not cover the ceremonies at all.|$|E

50|$|Italy {{has made}} {{multiple}} <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> the Winter Olympics. Cortina d'Ampezzo successfully <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1944 Winter Olympics but these games were cancelled due to World War II. Cortina d'Ampezzo <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1952 Winter Olympics but lost to Oslo. They successfully bid {{to host the}} 1956 Winter Olympics. They later <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1988 and 1992 Winter Games but lost to Calgary and Albertville respectively. Aosta <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1998 Winter Olympics but lost to Nagano. Tarvisio <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 2002 Winter Olympics but failed to become a candidate city. These games were ultimately awarded to Salt Lake City. Turin successfully bid to host the 2006 Winter Olympics.|$|R
5|$|Brown {{appointed}} {{a group of}} insurance experts to study the state's policies and put them out for bid, ultimately saving $2 million. He also required competitive bids from banks where state funds were deposited; the extra interest generated by this process generated an additional $50 million in revenue to the general fund. He opened communications and contacts with Japan, {{setting the stage for}} future economic relations between that country and Kentucky. Among his other accomplishments as governor were the implementation of competitive <b>bidding</b> <b>for</b> government contracts and passage of a weight-distance tax on trucks.|$|E
5|$|Some other Asian {{nations have}} {{expressed}} support for Japan's application, including Mongolia, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Vietnam—all major recipients of loan and/or foreign investment from Japan. The other G4 countries—Germany, Brazil, and India, who are also <b>bidding</b> <b>for</b> Security Council seats—along with France and the United Kingdom, also back Japan's bid. Australia, the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu support Japan since Japan agreed to increase financial aid to the region.|$|E
5|$|The 58th National Hockey League All-Star Game, {{also known}} as the 2011 National Hockey League All-Star Game {{presented}} by Discover, was the National Hockey League's (NHL) annual All-Star Game played on January 30, 2011. The game took place during the 2010–11 NHL season at the RBC Center in Raleigh, North Carolina, home of the Carolina Hurricanes. Originally, the Game was supposed to be hosted by the Phoenix Coyotes, but due to ownership issues, the NHL decided to move the game. After <b>bidding</b> <b>for</b> the game reopened, it was awarded to Carolina and fulfilled a nine-year-old promise made to the franchise by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.|$|E
50|$|Amsterdam {{has made}} {{a total of six}} <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> the Summer Olympic Games. They first <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1916 Summer Olympics but lost to Berlin. These games however were {{cancelled}} due to World War I. They then <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics but lost to Antwerp and Paris respectively. Amsterdam went on to successfully <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1928 Summer Olympics. The city later went on to <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1952 and 1992 Summer Olympics but lost to Helsinki and Barcelona respectively.|$|R
50|$|NSW-Sydney did not <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 2010 conference. The {{opportunity}} to bid therefore passed to South Australia as the bidder next in line. South Australia's decision to <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> 2010 {{means that it}} will not be eligible to <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> 2011 (for which it was originally scheduled to bid), and the <b>bidding</b> rights <b>for</b> 2011 will pass to Eastern (Victoria).|$|R
50|$|Rome first <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1908 Summer Olympics and was {{ultimately}} awarded the games. However {{the eruption of}} Mount Vesuvius in 1906 forced Italy to return the hosting rights to the IOC. The IOC transferred the 1908 Games to London. Rome later <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1924 Summer Olympics but lost to Paris. They then <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1936 Games but lost to Berlin. They <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1944 Summer Olympics which were awarded to London, then cancelled due to World War II. Rome successfully <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1960 Summer Olympics.|$|R
5|$|The Courthouse was {{designed}} by Jersey City native Hugh Roberts, twice {{a president of the}} New Jersey Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Roberts, brother-in-law of future United States Senator and New Jersey Governor Edward I. Edwards, received a direct appointment as architect. No competition or <b>bidding</b> <b>for</b> designs was held, causing controversy among local architects. The property on which the courthouse stands was obtained from fourteen separate property owners between 1905 and 1914. The groundbreaking took place on March 21, 1906 and the cornerstone was laid on December 12, 1906. Construction of the building was done by Wells Brothers of New York City and construction of the interiors and finishes were by John Gill & Son of Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{in favour of}} West Ham's bid was unanimous, although controversial as local rivals Tottenham Hotspur had also been <b>bidding</b> <b>for</b> the venue. Hopes of moving to the stadium, however, were since placed under doubt following a legal challenge by Tottenham and Leyton Orient, with Leyton Orient fearful that having West Ham playing {{less than a mile}} away from their Brisbane Road ground could steal support from the club and put them out of business. Both clubs' appeal for a judicial review, however, were rejected on 23 June 2011. On 3 March 2011, West Ham's proposed move to the Olympic Stadium was formally approved by the British government and Mayor of London Boris Johnson.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the 1991 season, a {{proposal}} was tabled {{for the establishment of a}} new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League. The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from The Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe. Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, Dyke and ITV would lose out in the <b>bidding</b> <b>for</b> broadcast rights as BSkyB won with a bid of £304million over five years with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.|$|E
50|$|Japan {{has also}} made <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> the Winter Olympics. Sapporo was awarded the 1940 Winter Olympics but it was {{cancelled}} due to World War II. They later <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1968 Winter Olympics but lost to Grenoble. Sapporo successfully <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1972 Winter Olympics, which marked the first Winter Olympic game held in Asia. They later made a <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1984 Winter Olympics but lost to Sarajevo.|$|R

In 2012, it <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the InterCity West Coast franchise {{in partnership with}} SNCF. Go-Ahead <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the Greater Anglia franchise.|$|R
5|$|Griffith {{remained}} a one-station market, however {{instead of taking}} programming from Prime {{in line with the}} network's other stations, MTN-9 relayed programming mainly from WIN Television in southern New South Wales. A supplementary licence, AMN-31, was successfully bid for by MTN in 1996, providing a relay of Prime Television. Soon after the station was purchased by WIN Television, which undertook a number of minor changes – mainly changing the news service to WIN News, and using entirely WIN branding. AMN-31 remains a relay of Prime. Similarly, the Mildura licence area remained separate from the remainder of Victoria, albeit with a single station, STV-8, later bought out by WIN Television in 1996. In 1997 Prime was successful in <b>bidding</b> <b>for</b> a new licence for the area at a cost of $3.2 million. PTV-31 began broadcasting the following year.|$|E
5|$|The city {{opened up}} <b>bidding</b> <b>for</b> the {{construction}} of the network in 2005, eventually receiving bids from eight different internet service providers. Of these eight, Atlanta-based EarthLink and Minnetonka-based US Internet were selected as semifinalists, and each company set up a trial program in Minneapolis before the final decision was made. During this process, outcry arose from both members of the Institute for Local Self Reliance about the lack of public hearings {{on the subject of the}} network, and from Qwest, another internet service provider who had placed a bid to build and run the network, about the city's plan to be involved in the wireless internet business at all. The deputy chief information officer of Minneapolis, Bill Beck, stated that the city was worried about legal restrictions and lawsuits, which were key reasons for the lack of transparency in the process.|$|E
5|$|When {{the chorus}} of the song begins, two women pull Gaga out of the bathtub, rip her top {{clothing}} off and force her to drink a glass of vodka. As the second verse begins, Gaga, wearing a diamond-covered outfit topped with a crown, seductively dances {{for a group of}} men <b>bidding</b> <b>for</b> her. She straddles one of the men, played by Slovenian model Jurij Bradač, and performs a lap dance for him. Afterwards, the man raises his bid and becomes the highest bidder for her. When the chorus is played for the third time, Gaga is shown wearing a faux-polar bear hide jacket. She walks towards the man, who is sitting on a bed and unbuttoning his shirt, while drinking a glass of vodka. Gaga has a look of indifference on her face and removes her jacket and sunglasses. Suddenly, the bed spontaneously combusts with the man still sitting on it, and Gaga sings in a sinister way in front of the flames. The video ends with her lying beside a smoldering skeleton, on top of the destroyed bed, covered in ashes. With soot smeared across her body, she calmly smokes a cigarette while her pyrotechnic bra activates.|$|E
50|$|England 2018 was the Football Association's {{unsuccessful}} <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> {{the right}} to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup. FIFA invited bidding countries to <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> either the 2018 or the 2022 finals, or both. The FA initially decided to <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> both, but with the withdrawal of all non-European <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> the 2018 event, this bid, and that of all other European bidding nations, were effectively disqualified from eligibility for the 2022 edition.|$|R
50|$|In February 2008, FFA {{formally}} {{announced their}} intention to <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 2022 FIFA World Cup and the 2015 AFC Asian Cup.
