40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was conducted with the view of obtaining baseline information {{on the use of}} polyethylene glycol (PEG) on Tasmanian Oak for the purpose of improving the quality of the seasoned structural timber product. Tasmanian Oak is the marketing name for a triad of Tasmanian-grown eucalypt species (E. delegatensis, E. obliqua, and E. regnans). Incubation of freshly-milled timber in aqueous PEG solutions prior to seasoning follows on from investigations in northern hemispheric timber species such as hoop pine and spruce {{in the middle of the}} 20 th Century. PEG penetrates freshly sawn Tasmanian Oak in a manner which is considerate of incubation time, temperature, PEG molecular weight/size and timber density. Histological examination indicated that PEG penetrated completely throughout the structure of the wood substance in three orientations (transverse, radial and tangential). During air-drying of PEG soaked timber, further migration of PEG into Tasmanian Oak is negligible. The rate of moisture content loss in Tasmanian Oak was shown to be retarded by PEG pre-treatment although the ability to prevent moisture loss was not concomitant with dimensional stability. An investigation to explain the change in rate of moisture loss examined effects on the thermodynamic property, water activity. Results indicated that a change in solution water activity could partly expain changes in the rate of moisture content loss, but more research is required to better divine this relationship. Shrinkage in Tasmanian Oak was reduced after treatment with aqueous PEG 400 solutions at or above 30 % (v/v), with a greater percentage reduction in tangential shrinkage compared to reduction in radial shrinkage. This is significant as <b>backsawn</b> (a. k. a. flatsawn) timber, with its broader tangential face, was in particular focus. The reduction in shrinkage was consistent with PEG concentration in the incubating medium. A decrease in the formation of drying defect, such as surface and internal checking accompanied the improvement in keeping sawn dimensions. <b>Backsawn</b> Tasmanian Oak obtained from young trees (less than 20 years) from plantation resource presents a challenging profile for commercial timber drying and will become more prevalent as the logging of old-growth forests is phased out. Timber seasoners may be faced with options of longer drying times or lower yields due to drying defect unless a method can be developed to provide added protection to the sawn timber product during drying. At this stage, pre-treatment of Tasmanian Oak with PEG shows the hallmarks of providing a solution to this emerging dilemma...|$|R

40|$|Solid wood {{properties}} {{were measured}} on samples cut from two progeny trials of Eucalyptus globulus: a six-year-old trial of later generation controlled-pollinated progeny; and a 15 -year-old provenance-progeny trial of first generation open-pollinated natural stand collections. Both stands had been grown under fibre-production management without early thinning and pruning. Tree size, stem sweep, and branch score was assessed, {{a subset of}} trees felled (34 age- 6 and 253 age- 15 trees) and 1. 5 -metre-long mini-sawlogs were harvested from a height of two metres. Back-sawn and quarter-sawn boards were cut from the mini sawlogs with portable sawmills. Whilst the sample sizes were relatively small and thus estimates of variances and heritabilities somewhat dubious, we observed apparent exploitable genetic variation in most traits. Growth, branch score and spring in green quarter-sawn boards showed significant between-subrace and probably within-subrace genetic variation. Bark thickness showed only between-subrace variance, and stem sweep showed only within-subrace genetic variation. Wood colour may have a low heritability but only very low additive variance, and cup in <b>backsawn</b> boards appeared {{to have a high}} degree of additive variance but very low heritability. No genetic variation in taper was observed...|$|R
40|$|The Tasmanian {{sawmilling}} industry typically {{does not}} season eucalypt material specifically for furniture applications {{because of its}} highly refractory seasoning characteristics. Boards cut with wide faces parallel to the growth rings ('backsawn or 'flatsawn' boards), in particular, shrink significantly with drying and often experience surface checking (seasoning 'degrade'). It is standard practice to season timber batches under schedules designed to produce relatively high-grade structural material and sell the small proportion of boards that do not suffer seasoning degrade as furniture grade material. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate optimum seasoning of <b>backsawn</b> material specifically for furniture applications to take advantage of the premium prices paid by furniture manufacturers for degrade-free material. Acoustic emission is a well known non-destructive testing tool. Acoustic emission results from stress waves generated by irreversible stress release activity such as the growth of small cracks in a solid material under load. Acoustic emission is typically used in homogeneous materials such as plastics and metals to determine the structural integrity of components in situ. Acoustic emission was first measured in timber subject to external load over thirty years ago and has subsequently been measured in drying timber specimens where differential drying rates between the surface and centre of a sample may cause appreciable drying stresses. Acoustic emission appeared to be related to the severity of the drying conditions and the development of surface checking (Becker 1982, Noguchi et al. 1987). Under harsh drying regimes, surface checking occurred and a significantly higher AE rate was measured than in the same species subject to mild drying conditions. The 'AE rate' is a measure of the occurrence of high-energy bursts of acoustic waves during a particular time-period - the higher the AE rate, the more energetic bursts are measured. On this basis, it appeared feasible to measure acoustic emission in sample boards in a kiln during drying and adjust the drying conditions as the AE rate approached levels previously determined to correspond to surface checking. Various AE-based kiln control systems were reported in the literature (Honeycutt et al. 1985, Noguchi et al. 1987) but it appears acoustic emission was not satisfactorily related to surface check development. These control systems controlled the drying conditions based on arbitrary AE rates that were nominally selected as 'safe' without optimising the drying process. The heterogeneous structure of timber posed significant obstacles to forming a clear picture of the stress release processes occurring in timber. Acoustic emission measured in drying Tasmanian eucalypt boards was employed in this project as an online measure of the magnitude of the stresses during drying. Numerous batches of eucalypt boards were obtained from a sawmill during the project and dried under harsh conditions to induce surface checking. It was determined that the AE rate generated at the onset of surface checking in <b>backsawn</b> and quartersawn boards was effectively constant (within the variability of the material). This 'AE checking threshold' was independent of basic density and clearly independent of bulk stiffness (since the bulk tangential stiffness is effectively half the radial stiffness in the species studied). It appeared that the acoustic emission phenomenon was independent of the timber bulk material properties. It is proposed that acoustic emission waves propagate from irreversible slips or dislocations in the crystalline cellulose regions of cell walls under high stress. These slips are sudden, energetic stress release events which propagate stress waves from the local site. The amorphous regions of the cell structure behave in a rather plastic manner with local stress expected to be consumed by ductile flow processes that do not generate elastic waves. Dinwoodie (1968) reported the existence of such crystalline slips in spruce timber under external compression. Siau (1984) reported that the proportion by mass of cellulose in normal wood (as opposed to tension and compression wood) was remarkably constant and apparently independent of species. Further, the proportion of crystalline cellulose is also relatively constant (Siau 1984). This appears to be directly related to the remarkably constant AE rate measured at the onset of surface checking in this study. This finding led to the measurement of acoustic emission in other species. It was hoped that the same AE 'rate would be measured at the onset of checking in different woods. Acoustic emission was measured in <b>backsawn</b> radiata pine (Pinus radiata) and myrtle (Nothofagus cunninghamii). The acoustic emission measured in radiata pine was significantly different from the acoustic emission measured in the eucalypt material, with relatively 'massive' AE rates detected in boards free of seasoning degrade. This behaviour was attributed to brittle failure in the resin canals, structural elements not present in the eucalypt genus. The characteristic AE responses measured in drying myrtle boards resembled the behaviour measured in the eucalypt boards, apparently due to the more similar structure. Surface checking was detected at approximately the same AE rate as that measured in the eucalypt boards. Much of the improved understanding of the acoustic emission phenomenon developed in this study was facilitated by the existence of a one-dimensional nonlinear drying model developed by Oliver (1991). Oliver wrote KILNSCHED (KILN SCHEDULING PROGRAM), a computer program based on this model, which simulates the drying behaviour of a single board, with arbitrary bulk material properties, subject to arbitrary drying conditions. KILNSCHED is particularly suited to low temperature drying of eucalypt materials. Kiln drying trials quickly revealed that 'green' Tasmanian eucalypt boards invariably suffered surface checking within 24 hours when subject to drying temperatures as low as 23 °C dry bulb temperature and 21 °C wet bulb temperature (at 0. 5 m/s airspeed). Such temperatures are significantly lower than those often employed in drying material direct off-saw in the timber industry but none-the-less are considered 'harsh' in this study. At the commencement of this study, KILNSCHED was used in a purely predictive mode to assess drying schedules prior to drying. The author of this thesis modified KILNSCHED to simulate drying using the real-time drying temperatures measured in the experimental kiln. This allowed measured acoustic emission during drying to be compared with the drying behaviour calculated with KILNSCHED. This modification revealed that Tasmanian eucalypt timber is far more sensitive to small temperature fluctuations than was previously expected. The reader must keep this material sensitivity to temperature and temperature change in mind at all times when reading this thesis. The AE rate measured during drying was successfully related to the instantaneous strain at a board surface calculated with KILNSCHED using the measured drying conditions. Instantaneous strain is the strain component employed as the failure criterion in the drying model. This enabled the author to place considerable confidence in behaviour calculated with KILNSCHED and the 'optimum drying' program SMARTKILN discussed below. This author modified KILNSCHED to incorporate an optimisation algorithm that determined the optimum drying conditions required to dry the timber in the minimum time at a preset arbritrary maximum surface instantaneous strain. The resulting program, SMARTKILN, develops drying schedules to maintain the calculated surface instantaneous strain at a preset 'Control Strain' below the ultimate surface instantaneous strain. Together, SMARTKILN and acoustic emission measurement form the basis of Clever Kiln Controller®, a kiln control system to dry Tasmanian eucalypt timber in the minimum time with minimum degrade. In Clever Kiln Controller, SMARTKILN uses datalogged real time drying conditions to simulate the drying behaviour of a sample board in the kiln. Calculated drying behaviour is continuously compared with measured drying behaviour (measured AE rate and moisture profiles measured by regularly slicing sample boards). Provided the calculated and measured drying behaviour are satisfactorily matched, the optimum drying schedule developed by SMARTKILN is applied to the kiln. When the AE rate approaches the AE checking threshold, the drying conditions are automatically ameliorated to prevent surface checking. Subsequently, SMARTKILN develops a refined optimum schedule to incorporate the new datalogged drying conditions. This study has developed the understanding of acoustic emission from the existing (often misleading) information recorded in the literature to a level that could be incorporated with current knowledge of the behaviour of drying timber. The thesis describes how this was achieved. Various aspects of the understanding have been reported in papers published, in press or under review. The final result is the development of a commercial kiln controller which is described and already implemented in some selected experimental kilns at present restricted to eucalypt materials...|$|R

5000|$|Dovetail saw [...] - [...] a small <b>backsaw</b> used to cut {{dovetail}}s. Although most {{dovetail saw}} teeth are set for cross-cutting, a rip saw tooth pattern is more efficient. These saws will {{usually have a}} higher number of teeth per inch (around 15 - 20 T.P.I.) with teeth sharpened to favor ripping operations and set to leave a narrow kerf.|$|E
5000|$|Tenon saw [...] - [...] a midsized <b>backsaw.</b> The saw derives {{its name}} from its use in the cutting of tenons for mortise and tenon joinery. Tenon saws are {{commonly}} available with rip-filed teeth for rip cutting and cross-cut for cutting across the grain. Teeth are relatively fine, with 13 teeth per inch being a common size for the saw.|$|E
5000|$|Mitre saw [...] - [...] often {{referred}} to as a large <b>backsaw</b> (20-30 inches or 60-90 cm) used either in a wooden or metal mitre box or in a metal frame which allowed cutting mitres of any specified angle. Note that not all mitre saws are backsaws, and the electric mitre saw (or chop saw) has largely taken its place today.|$|E
50|$|A <b>backsaw</b> is any {{hand saw}} {{which has a}} {{stiffening}} rib on the edge opposite the cutting edge, allowing for better control and more precise cutting than {{with other types of}} saws. Backsaws are normally used in woodworking for precise work, such as cutting dovetails, mitres, or tenons in cabinetry and joinery. Because of the stiffening rib, backsaws are limited in the depth to which they can cut. Backsaws usually have relatively closely spaced teeth, often with little or no set.|$|E
5000|$|Dōzuki [...] - [...] a Japanese <b>backsaw,</b> {{used for}} centuries by {{carpenters}} and cabinetmakers in Japan. Although this saw {{does not share}} an ancestry with the other backsaws in this group, the concept is the same. Like most Japanese saws, the dōzuki cuts on the pull stroke, allowing for much straighter and narrower cuts than those achieved with push-stroke saws. This is due to tension on the blade during the cut (versus compression for a western saw), so less thickness is required to keep the saw blade straight.|$|E
50|$|The {{work of a}} <b>backsaw</b> {{requires}} a thin, stiff blade. These two immediately incompatible requirements are resolved by swaging (and perhaps, spot welding) a stiffening cap over {{the length of the}} top edge of the blade. This thickening of the blade is the back and is generally made from some kind of metal, usually brass or steel. The stiffening back is carried through into the handle so that the blade does not bend between the two. The thickening of the back limits the depth to which the saw can cut but this is generally not a limitation in their typical uses.|$|E
5000|$|Razor saw [...] - [...] a {{very small}} <b>backsaw</b> having very finely pitched {{crosscut}} teeth, often with no set. The Razor saw is used by hobbyists, notably Model aircraft, boat, and railroad enthusiasts. Razor saws typically use disposable blades (or are occasionally designed to be completely disposable), since their teeth are so small as to be impractical to re-sharpen. A razor saw is capable of making clean cuts in very soft woods like Balsa, which most other saws would tend to tear out. Unlike most other types of backsaws, razor saws are also frequently used to cut plastics and soft metals.|$|E
50|$|In use, {{the board}} to be cut {{is placed in the}} box and {{the point at which the}} board is to be cut is lined up with the {{appropriate}} slot in the mitre box wall. A <b>backsaw</b> is the most common kind of saw used for this operation. The cut is started by placing the saw blade in the slot and drawing the saw back and forth. The slot guides the cut all the way through so that the result is a cut that is perpendicular to the face or edge of the board (depending upon the desired orientation of the cut) and at the appropriate angle. For precise work, a board cut in a mitre box might then be further adjusted on a shooting board.|$|E
50|$|A bench hook is a {{workbench}} accessory used in woodworking, and {{its purpose}} {{is to provide a}} stop against which the piece of wood being worked can be firmly held, without having to use the vice, thus saving time. It makes handsawing safer and more accurate. This simple appliance (three sticks of wood) uses the force of the tool and gravity to hold the workpiece and helps guide the tool blade to keep the cuts right on the line. It also allows one to perform with ease (and safety) those cuts that would be terrifying on a power saw and which should be carefully avoided. The bench hook is simply a short wooden board with a batten fixed along the top edge (the stop), with another one—called the hook—astened underneath the bottom at the opposite end (see diagram to the right). The correct practice is to have the stop shorter than the width of base and offset from one edge, thus allowing the saw to complete the cut without scarring the workbench surface. Left handers are obviously obliged to set the stop in reverse. In use the bench hook is laid flat over the bench, with the hook hard up against the front edge of same. With the workpiece thus firmly held against the stop, is easy to see that no clamps or other mechanical fixing are required, the wood being held in place by the combined pressure of the tool (a saw generally) and the hand. Bench hooks are meant to be an aid commonly used with hand tools, such as the <b>backsaw,</b> a hand plane and, somewhat less frequently, a chisel of some kind. Although very simple to make, commercially made bench hooks have become increasingly available.|$|E

Tests were conducted to evaluate the plugging mechanisms of metallic screens after cleaning up the altercate developed on an unconsolidated core by two exiting drill-in fluids (DIF's). Two simulated drill solids, clay or 75 -[]m reservoir sand were added as drill solids to these DIF 's. Poroplus[] metallic screens developed by Purolator Products Company were used to simulate the sand control device. The DIF's tested included a sized-calcium carbonate (SCC) and a sized-salt (SS). Drill solids added to the tested DIF's simulate tiny formation particles. The presence of these drill solids was found to affect the particle size distribution as well as the mean size (D[]) of the particles of the bridging and weighting material (BWM) and loss control material (LCM) that make up a fundamental part of the DIF's. BWM solids containing calcium montmorillonite clay showed that the median size of the particles was substantially decreased and the ultrafine material content (particles smaller than 45 []m) was increased. BWM solids containing 75 -[]m sand as drill solids showed an increase of the median size of the particles with a decrease in the ultrafine material. After the filtercake clean-up treatment and subsequent <b>backsaw,</b> screen plugging evaluated in terms of regained-flow capacity was much more severe {{in the presence of the}} whole altercate (after 3 % KCl treatments) than in the presence of the degraded filtercake (after HCI acid treatments). On the basis of the previous observations, it can be concluded that when SCC filtercakes were backflowed, the smaller the particle size of the altercate, the higher the minimum dislodging pressure (MDP) and screen plugging, and consequently the lower the regained-flow capacity. Coarse particle size of the filtercakes tended to result in minimum MDP, leading to higher regained-flow capacity and lower plugging of the screen. In contrast, these effects in SS filtercakes were masked by the presence of a polymer, xanthin gum, in the filtercake. The polymers act as glue on the sized particles forming a strong, tough, and rigid filtercake. Therefore, these filtercakes required high pressure to be backfired, decreasing the regained-flow capacity highly and causing severe plugging of the screens. Also, the results indicated that the hydrochloric acid treatment was more effective in removing the filtercakes than the 3 % KCI treatment. Also, it was demonstrated that the use of HCI is much more effective in removing the filtercake formed by SS than in removing the one formed by SCC...|$|E
