50|$|When the {{aggrieved party}} gains {{the right to}} {{terminate}} (whether <b>by</b> <b>breach,</b> <b>repudiation</b> or other causes), they must make a decision whether to terminate or not. This decision {{is referred to as}} 'election'. The Aggrieved party must elect whether to terminate the contract, or to affirm it (and thus continue it). Once a decision is made, it cannot be reversed. For there to be an election the aggrieved party must be aware that {{they have the right to}} terminate and must display unequivocal conduct that is only consistent with the performance of the contract.|$|R
40|$|Because {{the current}} {{remedial}} scheme represents {{a blend of}} property and contract Law, an adequate assessment requires delving into the property framework that existed before its revamping by contract. In part II, therefore, the {{focus will be on}} the remedial options traditionally associated with property law [...] Part III will examine the significant contract doctrines in this area of the law [...] <b>breach</b> <b>by</b> anticipatory <b>repudiation</b> and the avoidable consequences rule. An important concern is whether the contract and property rules have been or can be melded together in an overall remedial scheme that is conceptually understandable and practically consistent in the results it produces. Part IV addresses the shortcomings that exist in the present dual remedial scheme These shortcomings are due partly to preexisting weaknesses in the traditional property structure and partly to the inability of the property and contract remedies to work together as a coherent, unified whole. This Article will suggest that a more workable and understandable system would be achieved if the landlord 2 ̆ 7 s remedies were approached entirely from the standpoint of contract...|$|R
50|$|A <b>breach</b> <b>by</b> anticipatory <b>repudiation</b> (or simply anticipatory breach) is an unequivocal {{indication}} that the party will not perform when performance is due, or {{a situation in which}} future non-performance is inevitable. An anticipatory breach gives the non-breaching party the option to treat such a breach as immediate, and, if repudiatory, to terminate the contract and sue for damages (without waiting for the breach to actually take place) For example, A contracts with B on January 1 to sell 500 quintals of wheat and to deliver it on May 1. Subsequently, on April 15 A writes to B and says that he will not deliver the wheat. B may immediately consider the breach to have occurred and file a suit for damages for the scheduled performance, even though A has until May 1 to perform. However, a unique feature of anticipatory breach is that if an aggrieved party chooses not to accept a repudiation occurring before the time set for performance, not only will the contract continue on foot, but also there will be no right to damages unless and until an actual breach occurs.|$|R
