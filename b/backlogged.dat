5|$|McCarthy's {{judicial}} career attracted {{some controversy}} {{because of the}} speed with which he dispatched many of his cases as he worked to clear the heavily <b>backlogged</b> docket he had inherited. Wisconsin had strict divorce laws, but when McCarthy heard divorce cases, he expedited them whenever possible, and he made the needs of children involved in contested divorces a priority. When it came to other cases argued before him, McCarthy compensated for his lack of experience as a jurist by demanding and relying heavily upon precise briefs from the contesting attorneys. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard, but he was also censured in 1941 for having lost evidence in a price fixing case.|$|E

Marsh, desiring the fossils found in that region, became embroiled in Army-Indian politics. In order to gain the support of Chief Red Cloud of the Sioux to prospect, Marsh promised Red Cloud payment for fossils collected {{and that he would}} return to Washington, D.C. and lobby on their behalf about their improper treatment. In the end, Marsh slipped out of camp and according to his own (possibly romanticized) accounts, amassed cartloads of fossils and retreated just before a hostile Miniconjou party arrived. Marsh, for his part, did lobby the Interior Department and President Ulysses S. Grant on behalf of Red Cloud, but his motives might have been {{to make a name for}} himself against the unpopular Grant administration. By 1875, both Cope and Marsh paused in their collecting, feeling financial strain and needing to catalogue their <b>backlogged</b> finds, but new discoveries would return them to the West before decade's end.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} of King John, the Pipe rolls were growing unwieldy, as too many fines and fees were being recorded, making the finding of {{information}} in the rolls difficult. Eventually, after some experimentation, by 1206 a system whereby the actual detailed receipts were recorded {{in a set of}} receipt rolls and only aggregates were entered in the Pipe rolls was settled on. A further reform in 1236 resulted in debts being recorded in separate Estreat rolls, and only the totals entered into the Pipe rolls. In 1284 the Statutes of Rhuddlan were issued, which further reformed the accounting systems, and further reduced the detail contained on the Pipe rolls. At this time, a large number of unrecoverable debts were also removed from the rolls, a process that had also been attempted in 1270. The attempt in 1270 had marked old debts with a [...] "d" [...] and stipulated that they were not to be re-entered into future Pipe rolls unless they were paid off. But this had not worked, and so in 1284 old debts were to be recorded on a separate roll. The statutes in 1284 also laid out a procedure where debtors whose documentation of payment of debt that hadn't been accepted in the past would have that documentation accepted, thus helping to clear out some of the <b>backlogged</b> debts on the books.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{performance}} of a differential <b>backlog</b> routing algorithm in a network with random failures. Differential <b>Backlog</b> routing is a novel routing algorithm where packets are routed through multiple paths to their destinations based on queue <b>backlog</b> information. It is known that Differential <b>Backlog</b> routing maximizes the throughput capacity of the network; however little is known about practical implementations of Differential <b>Backlog</b> routing; and its delay performance. We compare Differential <b>Backlog</b> to Shortest Path and show that Differential <b>Backlog</b> routing outperforms Shortest Path when the network is heavily loaded and when the failure rate is high. Moreover, a hybrid routing algorithm that combines principles of both Shortest Path and Differential <b>Backlog</b> routing is presented, and is shown to outperform both. Finally, we demonstrate further improvements in delay performance of the aforementioned hybrid routing algorithm through the use of Digital Fountains. by Wajahat Faheem Khan. Thesis (M. Eng.)

The challenges in development management are, e. g., that a <b>backlog</b> does not provide a view to dependencies such as a feature requiring another feature or consequences of changes are not visible. We describe an approach towards managing development by analyzing the integration of a <b>backlog</b> and feature model. The integration is based on a correspondence between Kumbang feature modeling and Agilefant <b>backlog</b> meta-models. We describe the analyses that the integration conceptually enables i. e. analyses of development status, feature properties, and <b>backlog</b> order.
