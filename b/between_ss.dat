Berger next {{turned his attention to}} the Hungarian Volksdeutsche. Through an agreement with the Royal Hungarian Army, his recruiters enlisted more than 16,500 ethnic German recruits from Hungary between March and May 1942. While this campaign was ongoing, on 20 April 1942 Berger was promoted to SS-Gruppenführer. At this point, he saw a significant difference <b>between</b> <b>SS</b> ideological leadership and the martial indoctrination conducted by the German Army. In September 1942, the SS-FHA complained bitterly about Berger's recruiters, stating that many of the recruits were medically unsuitable, had been coerced or duped into enlisting, or were in fact ethnic Hungarians. Late in 1942, more Volksdeutsche from the Banat and Romania were combined with the SS Cavalry Brigade to form the SS-Kavallerie-Division. On 24 November 1942, the Chief of the Gestapo, Heinrich Müller advised Himmler of a proposal he had received from Berger that a Hungarian SS division could be financed by selling emigration permits to Slovak Jews.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} time-resolved ultrafast optical {{spectroscopy}} {{study of the}} topological insulator (TI) Bi_ 2 Se_ 3. We unravel that a net spin polarization can not only be generated using circularly polarized light via interband transitions between topological surface states (SSs), but also via transitions <b>between</b> <b>SSs</b> and bulk states. Our experiment demonstrates that tuning photon energy or temperature can essentially allow for photoexcitation of spin-polarized electrons to unoccupied topological SSs with two distinct spin relaxation times (∼ 25 fs and ∼ 300 fs), depending on the coupling <b>between</b> <b>SSs</b> and bulk states. The intrinsic mechanism leading to such distinctive spin dynamics is the scattering in SSs and bulk states which is dominated by E_g^ 2 and A_ 1 g^ 1 phonon modes, respectively. These findings are suggestive of novel ways to manipulate the photoinduced coherent spins in TIs. Comment: Accepted for publication in Phys. Rev. Let...|$|R

30|$|The standard[1] defines {{two layers}} to support fixed WMAN. The MAC layer sits atop the PHY layer and mediates {{between it and}} the layers above. The {{protocol}} that operates the MAC layer performs the main tasks of the standard, such as QoS provisioning, connection admission control (CAC), bandwidth allocation, and scheduling. It supports two modes of operation: point-to-multipoint (PMP) and mesh. The former is a cellular-like structure that supports communication between a base station (BS) and a set of SSs in broadcast fashion. The BS is the central controller, regulating all communications between itself and a set of SSs. The two paths of communication between the BS and the SSs are the uplink (‘UP’; from SS to BS) and downlink (‘DL’; from BS to SS) directions. In contrast, mesh mode supports multihop communication <b>between</b> <b>SSs.</b> In this paper, we consider PMP as the main operational mode.|$|R

Methods: A retrospective chart review was undertaken to col-lect hemoglobin A 1 C, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) for patients enrolled in the CVRRC from July 2010 and August 2012. A 2 -sample t-test was utilized to compare these outcomes <b>between</b> ES and <b>SS</b> patients. Results: A total of 9 SS patients and 62 ES patients were included.

40|$|Based on {{the work}} from the IEEE Working Group 802. 16 and ETSI HiperMAN Working Group, the WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) {{technology}} {{is defined by the}} WiMAX Forum to support fixed and mobile broadband wireless access. In the standard (IEEE 802. 16 standard, 2009), it defines several air interface variants, including WirelessMAN-SC, WirelessMAN-OFDM, WirelessMAN-OFDMA and WirelessMAN-HUMAN. WiMAX networks can be operated in two different modes: point to multi-point (PMP) mode and mesh mode. Under the PMP mode, all traffics from subscriber stations (SSs) are controlled by the base station. Mesh mode is a distributed architecture where traffics are allowed to route not only <b>between</b> <b>SSs</b> and the base station but also <b>between</b> <b>SSs.</b> In this chapter, we focus on the WirelessMAN-SC air interface operating in the PMP mode. In WiMAX networks, quality of service (QoS) is provided through five different services classes in the MAC layer (Andrews et al., 2007) : 1. Unsolicited grant service (UGS) is designed for real-time applications with constant data rate. These applications always have stringent delay requirement, such as T 1 /E 1. 2. Real-time polling service (rtPS) is designed for real-time applications with variable data rate. These applications have less stringent delay requirement, such as MPEG and VoIP without silence suppression. 3. Extended real-time polling service (ertPS) builds on the efficiency of both UGS and rtPS. It is designed for the applications with variable data rate such as VoIP with silence suppression. 4. Non-real-time polling service (nrtPS) is designed to support variable bit rate non-real-time applications with certain bandwidth guarantee, such as high bandwidth FTP. 5. Best effort service (BE) is designed for best effort applications such as HTTP. To meet the requirements of different service classes, several bandwidth request mechanisms have been defined, namely, unsolicited granting, unicast polling, broadcast polling and piggybacking. In this chapter, we present a performance model for services, such as BE service, based on the broadcast polling mechanism which is contention based and requires he SSs to use the truncated binary exponential backoff (TBEB) algorithm (Kwak et al., 2005) to resolve contention...|$|R
