5|$|From March to April 1999, there arose a huge {{groundswell of}} public dissent {{in the media}} over the National Library building's fate, {{as well as the}} drastic {{physical}} alterations of its environs. A number of featured columns <b>by</b> <b>journalists</b> touched on gradually disappearing heritage landmarks, as well as shared memories of Singaporeans.|$|E

5|$|In the media, {{there were}} many testimonials and refutations given <b>by</b> <b>journalists</b> {{for the first part}} of Carr's {{argument}} regarding the capacity for concentration; treatments of the second part of Carr's argument regarding the capacity for contemplation, were, however, far rarer. Although columnist Andrew Sullivan noted that he had little leisure time at his disposal for contemplation compared with when he grew up, the anecdotes provided <b>by</b> <b>journalists</b> that indicated a deficiency in the capacity to contemplate were described only in the context of third parties, such as columnist Margaret Wente's anecdote about how one consultant had found a growing tendency in her clients to provide ill-considered descriptions for their technical problems.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his writing, {{at the time of his}} death Wallace had been for many years a {{well-known}} figure both as a scientist and as a social activist. He was often sought out <b>by</b> <b>journalists</b> and others for his views on a variety of topics. He received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours, such the Royal Society's Royal Medal and Darwin Medal in 1868 and 1890 respectively, and the Order of Merit in 1908. Above all, his role as the co-discoverer of natural selection and his work on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure.|$|E
5|$|In January 1999, 23 {{military}} officers {{were arrested for}} plotting a coup against Mugabe. The government sought to hide this, although it was reported on <b>by</b> <b>journalists</b> from The Standard. The military subsequently illegally arrested the journalists and tortured them. This brought international condemnation, with the EU and seven donor nations issuing protest notes. Lawyers and human rights activists protested outside parliament until being dispersed by riot police, and the country's Supreme Court judges issued a letter condemning the military's actions. In response, Mugabe publicly defended the use of extra-legal arrest and torture.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the growing cardistry community, Dan and Dave organized the first cardistry convention and interactive conference to promote the performance art in 2014, called Cardistry-Con. The convention saw interviews, panel discussions, live performances, exclusive video screenings, workshops, contests and giveaways. The 2015 convention was attended <b>by</b> <b>journalists</b> from magazines such as Vanity Fair and Wired as well as television stations, all of which helped further popularize cardistry as an art. Its growth {{has been associated with}} its availability with the availability of videos, lessons and podcasts, which tend to make the art more transparent and available to all who are interested.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the season, the Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians, the division's top two {{finishers}} in the previous season, were predicted to be the strongest teams <b>by</b> <b>journalists</b> such as Tom Verducci of ESPN and Joe Sheehan of Baseball Prospectus. However, the Indians lineup was weakened by injuries and spent just 13 days of the season in the division lead, last on May 17. The Tigers never led the AL Central and finished the season in last place, 14 games back.|$|E

5|$|The Priory of Sion myth {{has been}} exhaustively debunked <b>by</b> <b>journalists</b> and {{scholars}} {{as one of}} the great hoaxes of the 20th century. Some skeptics have expressed concern that the proliferation and popularity of books, websites and films inspired by this hoax have contributed to the subject of conspiracy theories, pseudohistory and other confusions becoming more mainstream. Others are troubled by the romantic reactionary ideology unwittingly promoted in these works.|$|E
5|$|The Ripper murders mark an {{important}} watershed {{in the treatment}} of crime <b>by</b> <b>journalists.</b> Jack the Ripper was not the first serial killer, but his case was the first to create a worldwide media frenzy. Tax reforms in the 1850s had enabled the publication of inexpensive newspapers with wider circulation. These mushroomed in the later Victorian era to include mass-circulation newspapers as cheap as a halfpenny, along with popular magazines such as The Illustrated Police News which made the Ripper the beneficiary of previously unparalleled publicity.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{announced}} {{two months after}} full development began. Due to its Japanese setting and aesthetic, its Western release retains the Japanese voice track with subtitles rather than an English dub. Reception of the game was generally positive; many praised the battle system, reactions to the story were mixed to positive, and other elements such as dungeon designs {{and a lack of}} Fire Emblem-related elements were criticized along with technical problems. The game was later chosen <b>by</b> <b>journalists</b> {{as one of the best}} games for the console.|$|E

5|$|At L'Ora, De Mauro {{joined a}} group of crack investigative reporters. From the mid-1950s to the 1970s the left-leaning {{newspaper}} often hit the national spotlight for its investigations and denunciations about the ties between the Sicilian Mafia and corrupt politicians. These were the golden years of investigations, signed <b>by</b> <b>journalists</b> like Mauro De Mauro, Felice Chilanti and Mario Farinella. De Mauro could exercise his skills as a successful investigative reporter. He wrote on drug trafficking and the Sack of Palermo, the construction boom in the 1950s and 1960s {{that led to the}} destruction of the city's green belt and ancient villas. He also published articles about the collusion between the Mafia and politics. In 1960 he was among the winners of the Premiolino, {{one of the most important}} Italian journalism awards, for his crime investigations.|$|E
5|$|Development of Shiny Festa {{began as}} a result of series {{producer}} Yōzō Sakagami's desire to create a video game that has a lighter feel and makes use of the franchise's songs that had not been featured in video game form. Shiny Festa original releases sold a total of 119,132 copies in its first week of release in Japan, and together ranked as the best-selling video game in Japan that week. The games were described by reviewers as accessible to the franchise's new and existing fans, but the iOS releases were criticized <b>by</b> <b>journalists</b> for their prohibitive pricing. The mechanics of Shiny Festa later reappear in The Idolmaster Shiny TV, a high-definition remastered version for the PlayStation 3.|$|E
5|$|Having been an {{important}} through route since Roman times, businesses were established along the road during the Middle Ages. Senior clergy lived in Fleet Street during this period where there are several churches including Temple Church and St Bride's. Fleet Street became known for printing and publishing {{at the start of}} the 16th century and it became the dominant trade so that by the 20th century most British national newspapers operated from here. Much of the industry moved out in the 1980s after News International set up cheaper manufacturing premises in Wapping, but some former newspaper buildings are listed and have been preserved. The term Fleet Street remains a metonym for the British national press, and pubs on the street once frequented <b>by</b> <b>journalists</b> remain popular.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Lightning placed 34th in a Famitsu poll {{regarding}} {{the most popular}} video game character in Japan. She was voted the best-liked female Final Fantasy character in a 2013 poll by Square Enix, and, in that year's Dengeki PlayStation Awards, she was voted best video game character {{of the year for}} her appearance in Lightning Returns. She came first in a Microsoft poll to determine the most popular character of the Final Fantasy XIII games. In 2014, readers of IGN voted her the best character in XIII. At PAX Prime 2013, she took third place in a list, compiled <b>by</b> <b>journalists</b> and game developers, of the top female characters in western and Japanese role-playing video games. In a Famitsu poll from 2017, Lightning was voted as the second most wanted character fans expect to be featured in another Square Enix's franchise, Kingdom Hearts, being surpassed only by Noctis Lucis Caelum from Final Fantasy XV.|$|E
5|$|In August 1982, he fronted a {{consortium}} – funded by Saudi brothers Mahmud and Mohammad Bhatti {{of the company}} Allied Properties – that took Wolverhampton Wanderers out of liquidation, beating a rival bid from Doug Ellis. The brothers wanted anonymity, and were only revealed to the public after investigation <b>by</b> <b>journalists.</b> He sacked manager Ian Greaves and replaced him with former Wolves teammate Graham Hawkins. However the council rejected planning permission for the club to construct a supermarket, and the Bhattis were {{unwilling or unable to}} provide further funding for the club. Wolves won promotion out of the Second Division in 1982–83, but were relegated out of the First Division in last place in 1983–84, and Dougan sacked Hawkins and replaced him with Tommy Docherty. Dougan resigned in January 1985.|$|E
5|$|In response, India {{lost their}} key batsman, Sachin Tendulkar, {{at the start}} of the innings. Despite a brief {{interruption}} by rain after the 17th over, no time was lost from the game. Once play resumed, India lost wickets at regular intervals. Virender Sehwag top-scored for India with 82 runs, before the team were bowled out for 234 runs in the 40th over. For Australia, Glenn McGrath took three wickets for 52 runs, while Brett Lee and Andrew Symonds claimed two wickets each. Ponting was named man of the match for his 140, and Tendulkar, the tournament's leading run-scorer (673 runs), was awarded the man of the series. The final was Australia's seventeenth successive ODI win, a record, and they were the first team to win three World Cups.
