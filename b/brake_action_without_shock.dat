40|$|Abstract — Driver {{assistance}} systems have both {{the potential to}} alert the driver to critical situations and distract or annoy the driver if the driver is already aware of the situation. As systems attempt to preemptively warn drivers {{more and more in}} advance, this problem becomes exacerbated. We present a predictive braking assistance system that identifies not only the need for <b>braking</b> <b>action,</b> but also whether or not a <b>braking</b> <b>action</b> is being planned by the driver. Our system uses a Bayesian framework to determine the criticality of the situation by assessing (1) the probability that braking should be performed given observations of the vehicle and surround and (2) the probability that the driver intends to perform a <b>braking</b> <b>action.</b> We train and evaluate our system using over 22 hours of data collected from real driving scenarios with 28 different drivers.

40|$|In Chinese {{mainline}} railway, freight trains {{need to stop}} within passenger stations {{at times}} because of the delayed passenger trains. Without any decision-support system, {{it is very difficult}} for drivers to stop trains within stations with consistency in one <b>braking</b> <b>action.</b> The reasons are that braking performance of train changes with the conditions of braking equipment and the drivers’ subjective evaluations of track profiles and braking distance are vague and imprecise. This paper presents a fuzzy neural network (FNN), which is based on the historical datasets of train stops, to model the latest condition of train braking equipment and to attain the braking distance under a predefined braking rate, track profiles, and initial braking speed. The braking distance is used to find the initial braking position to advise the drivers on commencing <b>braking</b> <b>action.</b> Case studies confirm that it is feasible to stop trains within stations in one <b>braking</b> <b>action</b> by applying the proposed approach. Furthermore, the runtime and energy consumption of train movement are both reduced in comparison to the practical two-step action train stopping (TATS); that is, drivers stop trains before entering stations and remotor at a low speed before slowly stopping within stations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPilots need {{accurate}} predictions on {{the quality}} of runway surface conditions when operating on snow/ice contaminated runways. These predictions are typically made by friction measurements, or by expert judgments of runway inspectors. This study presents a decision support model (the IRIS runway model) for runway inspectors that interprets descriptive data from SNOWTAM reports and predicts the <b>braking</b> <b>action</b> on the common scale from 1 to 5, ranging from “poor” to “good”. The model is tested on two airports in Norway during the winter seasons 2008 / 2009 to 2010 / 2011. Two other predictors of the <b>braking</b> <b>action</b> (assessments by runway inspectors and friction measurements) were also included. Analyses of 1261 friction-limited landings of commercial airplanes were used to compare predicted and measured <b>braking</b> <b>actions.</b> The IRIS runway model was found to be more conservative than the assessments of Norwegian runway inspectors, and even more conservative than friction measurements. In 86 % of the landings, the IRIS runway model predicted the conditions within ± 1 category of what the airplanes experienced, compared to 77 % achieved by the runway inspectors. The predictions by the friction measurement devices were the least conservative and predicted the conditions within ± 1 category in 61 % of the landings. The model is now implemented in 15 airports in Norway...|$|R

30|$|The PISa (Powered two wheeler Integrated Safety) project {{focused on}} the {{development}} and implementation of integrated safety systems for PTWs. The main outcomes were the development of Active Braking (AB) and Distance Support (DS) functions. The former performs an autonomous <b>braking</b> <b>actions</b> whenever an unavoidable collision is identified and no rider action is detected, to reduce impact speed and thus accident consequences. DS function supports the rider during normal riding conditions providing information on the safe distance from the leading vehicle. The HMI strategy used tactile interaction in both case although different information had to be provided: for AB function the rider received a warning, limited in time, about the oncoming <b>braking</b> <b>action</b> of the system. The tactile interaction was chosen as it allowed the rider to receive information without moving his/her sight from the road ahead (this aspect is particularly relevant when riders have to deal with an unavoidable accident). The HMI device associated with AB was a vibrating saddle activated to warn the rider before of the <b>braking</b> <b>action,</b> while for DS Support was developed a Haptic Throttle able to provide a torque feedback on the throttle handle. The Haptic Saddle consisted of a set of independent vibrating elements integrated in the saddle foam, and properly positioned to provide a tactile perception. The Haptic Throttle provided a torque feedback on the throttle handle to suggest a safe distance to the vehicle ahead. The system was designed to leave the full control to the rider since the torque can be overridden in case the rider decides to overtake the leading vehicle instead of following [12].|$|R

This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Applied Ergonomics [© Elsevier] and is available at: [URL] order to improve road safety, automobile manufacturers are now developing Forward Collision Warning Systems (FCWS). However, there has been insufficient consideration of how drivers may respond to FCWS. This driving simulator study focused on alarm timing and its impact on driver response to alarm. The experimental investigation considered driver perception of alarm timings and its influence on trust at three driving speeds (40, 60 and 70 mile/h) and two time headways (1. 7 and 2. 2 s). The results showed that alarm effectiveness varied in response to driving conditions. Alarm promptness had a greater influence on ratings of trust than improvements in braking performance enabled by the alarm system. Moreover, alarms which were presented after <b>braking</b> <b>actions</b> had been initiated were viewed as late alarms. It is concluded that drivers typically expect alarms to be presented before they initiate <b>braking</b> <b>actions</b> and when this does not happen driver trust in the system is substantially decreased...|$|R
