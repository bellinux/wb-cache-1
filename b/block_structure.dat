5|$|For a block {{cellular}} automaton, testing reversibility is also easy: the automaton is reversible if {{and only}} if the transition function on the blocks of the automaton is invertible, and in this case the reverse automaton has the same <b>block</b> <b>structure</b> with the inverse transition function.|$|E
5|$|Designing {{reversible}} {{rules for}} block cellular automata, and {{determining whether a}} given rule is reversible, is easy: for a block cellular automaton to be reversible it is necessary and sufficient that the transformation applied to the individual blocks at {{each step of the}} automaton is itself reversible. When a block cellular automaton is reversible, the time-reversed version of its dynamics can also be described as a block cellular automaton with the same <b>block</b> <b>structure,</b> using a time-reversed sequence of partitions of cells into blocks, and with the transition function for each block being the inverse function of the original rule.|$|E
5|$|The city {{is built}} on the slope {{surrounding}} the citadel, located on a dominating plateau. Although the city's walls {{were built in the}} third century and the city itself was first mentioned in the 12th century, the majority of the existing buildings date from 17th and 18th centuries. Typical houses consist of a tall stone <b>block</b> <b>structure</b> which can be up to five stories high. There are external and internal staircases that surround the house. It is thought that such design stems from fortified country houses typical in southern Albania. The lower storey of the building contains a cistern and the stable. The upper storey is composed of a guest room and a family room containing a fireplace. Further upper stories are to accommodate extended families and are connected by internal stairs. Since Gjirokastër's membership to UNESCO, a number of houses have been restored, though others continue to degrade.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a study of {{high-throughput}} filter <b>structures</b> such as <b>block</b> <b>structures</b> and their behavior in finite precision environments. <b>Block</b> <b>structures</b> achieve high throughput rates by using {{a large number of}} processors working in parallel. It has been believed that <b>block</b> <b>structures</b> which are relatively robust to round-off noise must also be robust to coefficient quantization errors. However, our research has shown that <b>block</b> <b>structures,</b> in fact, have high coefficient sensitivity. A potential problem that arises as a result of coefficient quantization is a periodically time-varying behavior exhibited by the realized filter. We will demonstrate how finite wordlength errors can change a nominally time-invariant filter into a time-varying system. We will identify the <b>block</b> <b>structures</b> that have low coefficient sensitivity, and develop high-speed structures that are immune to the time-varying problems caused by coefficient quantization...|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} federal, county, and private {{hospitals}} suffered {{varying degrees of}} damage, with four major facilities in the San Fernando Valley experiencing structural damage, and two of those experiencing collapse. The Indian Hills Medical Center, Foothill Medical Building, and the Pacoima Lutheran Professional building were all heavily damaged, but nursing homes were also affected. One facility in particular, the one-story Foothill Nursing Home, sat very close to {{a section of the}} fault that broke the surface and was raised up three feet relative to the street. Scarps ran along the sidewalk and across the property, but the building was not in use at the time, and remained standing.

2500|$|<b>Block</b> <b>structure</b> was {{introduced}} into computer programming languages by the Algol project (1957–1960), which, as a consequence, also featured a context-free grammar {{to describe the}} resulting Algol syntax.

40|$|Dixon [1908] {{introduces}} {{three distinct}} determinant formulations for the resultant of three bivariate polynomials of bidegree (m,n). The first technique applies Sylvester's dialytic method {{to construct the}} resultant as the determinant of a matrix of order 6 mn. The second approach uses Cayley's determinant device to form a more compact representation for the resultant as the determinant of a matrix of order 2 mn. The third method employs a combination of Cayley's determinant device with Sylvester's dialytic method to build the resultant as the determinant of a matrix of order 3 mn. Here relations between these three resultant formulations are derived {{and the structure of}} the transformations between these resultant matrices is investigated. In particular, it is shown that these transformation matrices all have similar, simple, upper triangular, <b>block</b> symmetric <b>structures</b> and the <b>blocks</b> themselves have elegant symmetry properties. Elementary entry formulas for the transformation matrices are also provided. In light of these results, the three Dixon resultant matrices are reexamined and shown to have natural <b>block</b> <b>structures</b> compatible with the <b>block</b> <b>structures</b> of the transformation matrices. These <b>block</b> <b>structures</b> are analyzed here and applied along with the <b>block</b> <b>structures</b> of the transformation matrices to simplify the calculation of the entries of the Dixon resultants of order 2 mn and 3 mn and to make these calculations more efficient by removing redundant computations...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that haplotypes tend to have block-like {{structures}} throughout the human genome. Several methods were proposed for haplotype block partitioning and for tagging single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification. In population genetics studies, several research groups compared <b>block</b> <b>structures</b> across human populations. However, the measures used to quantify population similarity are either less than satisfactory or nonexistent. In this article, we propose several similarity measures to facilitate the comparisons of haplotype <b>structures,</b> namely <b>block</b> boundaries and tagging SNPs, across populations. With these measures, we can more objectively compare haplotype <b>block</b> <b>structures</b> and tagging SNP sets between different populations. In addition, these measures allow us to compare the results of different methods for block partition and tagging SNP identification. When we applied these measures to a real data set on chromosome 10 in 16 worldwide populations, we found that in this genome region: 1) haplotype block boundaries vary among populations, with European and some African populations showing similar boundaries but other populations showing other patterns; 2) tagging SNP sets are generally similar for populations with similar haplotype <b>block</b> <b>structures</b> but differ if the <b>block</b> <b>structures</b> differ; and 3) {{all but one of}} the block finding methods we tested yield consistent results, although variations exist regarding consistency.
