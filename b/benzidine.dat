Besides glucose oxidase, the test kit contains a <b>benzidine</b> derivative, which is oxidized to a blue polymer by the hydrogen peroxide formed in the oxidation reaction. The disadvantage of this method was that the test strip had to be developed after a precise interval (the blood had to be washed away), and the meter needed to be calibrated frequently.|$|E
50|$|As {{with some}} other {{aromatic}} amines such as 2-naphthylamine, <b>benzidine</b> has been significantly withdrawn from use in most industries {{because it is so}} carcinogenic. In August 2010 <b>benzidine</b> dyes were included in the U.S. EPA's List of Chemicals of Concern.The manufacture of <b>Benzidine</b> has been illegal in the UK since at least 2002 under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 (COSHH).|$|E
50|$|Kaifer and Stoddart in 1994 {{modify their}} {{molecular}} shuttle {{such a way}} that an electron-poor tetracationic cyclophane bead now has a choice between two docking stations: one biphenol and one <b>benzidine</b> unit. In solution at room temperature NMR spectroscopy reveals that the bead shuttles at a rate comparable to the NMR timescale, reducing the temperature to 229K resolves the signals with 84% of the population favoring the <b>benzidine</b> station. However, on addition of trifluoroacetic acid, the <b>benzidine</b> nitrogen atoms are protonated and the bead is fixed permanently on the biphenol station. The same effect is obtained by electrochemical oxidation (forming the <b>benzidine</b> radical ion) and significantly both processes are reversible.|$|E
5000|$|Azo dyes {{derived from}} <b>benzidine</b> are carcinogens; {{exposure}} to them has classically {{been associated with}} bladder cancer. Accordingly, the production of <b>benzidine</b> azo dyes was discontinued in the 1980s [...] "in the most important western industrialized countries".|$|E
50|$|Conversion of <b>benzidine</b> to the bis(diazonium) salt {{was once}} an {{integral}} step {{in the preparation of}} direct dyes (requiring no mordant). Treatment of this bis(diazonium) salt with 1-aminonaphthalene-4-sulfonic acid gives the once popular congo red dye. In the past, <b>benzidine</b> was used to test for blood. An enzyme in blood causes the oxidation of <b>benzidine</b> to a distinctively blue-coloured derivative. The test for cyanide relies on similar reactivity. Such applications have largely been replaced by methods using phenolphthalein/hydrogen peroxide and luminol.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzidine</b> (trivial name), {{also called}} 1,1'-biphenyl-4,4'-diamine (systematic name), is an organic {{compound}} with the formula (C6H4NH2)2. It is an aromatic amine.

50|$|TTF and quinones {{have more}} than one stable {{oxidation}} state, and therefore can be switched with redox chemistry or electrochemistry. Other units such as <b>benzidine</b> derivatives, viologens groups and fullerenes, have also been utilized in supramolecular electrochemical devices.|$|E
5000|$|... 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine is {{considered}} a carcinogen. This compound {{has been shown to}} increase the incidence of tumors in animals. Because it is structurally similar to <b>benzidine,</b> a known carcinogen, it is believed that it may share a similar mechanism in causing bladder cancer in humans.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} of these pigments involves {{the reaction of}} diazotized aromatic diamines (derivatives of <b>benzidine)</b> with coupling components, typically derivatives of acetoacetanilide. By varying both of these components, {{a wide variety of}} pigments have been produced. A related family of organic pigments are the simpler arylides, which arise from the coupling of monodiazonium salts with the same coupling partners.|$|E
50|$|S. haemolyticus is nonmotile, nonsporulating, facultatively anaerobic, and Gram-positive. Cells are {{typically}} coccus-shaped and range from 0.8-1.3 μm in diameter. It {{lives on a}} wide variety of substrates, including glucose, glycerol, maltose, sucrose, and trehalose. It also tests positive for acetoin production, arginine, dihydrolase, <b>benzidine,</b> catalase, hemolysis, and lipase; it tests negative for coagulase, DNase, ornithine decarboxylase, phosphatase, urease, and oxidase.|$|E
50|$|This species {{produces}} catalase, phosphatase and heat-labile nuclease. It {{is positive}} in the <b>benzidine</b> test and weakly positive in methyl red test. It exhibits clear hemolysis on ovine blood agar medium. It produces lecithinase, splits Tween 20, Tween 40, and Tween 80 and reduces nitrate. On crystal violet agar it may produce white (positive, E type) colonies or blue (negative, D type) colonies.|$|E
5000|$|TMB {{should be}} kept out of direct {{sunlight}} as it is photosensitive. It is not known if TMB is carcinogenic and the evidence is contradictory: TMB is not mutagenic by the Ames test, and did not induce formation of tumors in a single-arm study of 24 rats. [...] On that evidence, {{it has been used}} as a replacement for carcinogenic compounds such as <b>benzidine</b> and o-phenylenediamine.|$|E
50|$|The {{sulfonic}} acid derivatives of 1-naphthylamine {{are used for}} the preparation of azo dye, these dyes possessing the important property of dyeing unmordanted cotton. The most important is naphthionic acid, 1-aminonaphthalene-4-{{sulfonic acid}}, produced by heating 1-naphthylamine and sulfuric acid to 170-180 °C with about 3% of crystallized oxalic acid. It forms small needles, very sparingly soluble in water. Upon treatment with the bis(diazonium) derivative of <b>benzidine,</b> 1-aminonaphthalene-4-sulfonic acid gives Congo red.|$|E
50|$|Thirty {{percent of}} bladder tumors {{probably}} result from occupational exposure {{in the workplace}} to carcinogens such as <b>benzidine.</b> 2-Naphthylamine, which is found in cigarette smoke, {{has also been shown}} to increase bladder cancer risk. Occupations at risk are bus drivers, rubber workers, motor mechanics, leather (including shoe) workers, blacksmiths, machine setters, and mechanics. Hairdressers are thought to be at risk as well because of their frequent exposure to permanent hair dyes.|$|E
5000|$|... 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{that is both}} chemically and thermodynamically stable.

50|$|Accepting a {{position}} as pathologist at the DuPont-funded Haskell Laboratory of Industrial Toxicology, Hueper recognized that certain industrial dyes were causing bladder cancer in DuPont workers, including <b>benzidine</b> and β-Naphthylamine. Hueper warned them explicitly of dangers to their workers in 1937, and throughout 1938. DuPont was unappreciative of this information, and Hueper left because of DuPont's efforts to censor and block publication of what Hueper had learned. In fact, DuPont continued to censor and undermine Hueper's efforts to publish on environmental causes of cancer through back channels throughout {{the remainder of his}} lifetime.|$|E
50|$|Following {{his formal}} questioning, Sangret was {{returned}} to barracks. His army blanket and uniform had been confiscated at Godalming police station, and sent to a Dr. Roche Lynch at St Mary's Hospital to undergo <b>Benzidine</b> testing. Dr. Lynch was able to conclude that both the trousers and blanket had recently been washed in a basic and clumsy manner, and that each garment bore evidence of bloodstains. Furthermore, Lynch was able to deduce that the positioning of the bloodstains within the army blanket was consistent with where blood would have seeped from Wolfe's head and arm wounds, had she been wrapped in this garment.|$|E

However, no DNA could be extracted from the blood as it was too degraded. Police also found DNA {{of a man and a}} woman in the car, which belonged to neither the victim nor the suspects. It was assumed to belong to [...] "El Cuco"'s mother and her boyfriend, but neither agreed to provide a DNA sample for comparison.|$|E
50|$|Substituted biphenyls {{and have}} many uses. They are {{prepared}} by various coupling reactions including the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction and the Ullmann reaction. Polychlorinated biphenyls were once used as cooling and insulating fluids and polybrominated biphenyls are flame retardants. The biphenyl motif also appears in {{drugs such as}} diflunisal and telmisartan. The abbreviation E7 stands for a liquid crystal mixture consisting of several cyanobiphenyls with long aliphatic tails used commercially in liquid crystal displays. A variety of <b>benzidine</b> derivatives are used in dyes and polymers. Research into biphenyl liquid crystal candidates mainly focuses on molecules with highly polar heads (for example cyano or halide groups) and aliphatic tails.|$|E
50|$|Large {{multicellular}} organisms engage multiple {{systems as}} defensive efforts against infecting bacteria or invading parasites. One strategy, which {{falls under the}} domain of cellular immunity, depends on the action of enzymes which catalyze the peroxidase reaction. Eosinophil peroxidase {{can be found in}} the primary (azurophilic) granules of human and mammalian leukocytes. Peroxidase localization in leukocytes has been studied throughout the 20th century using staining agents such as <b>benzidine</b> hydrochloride. Before the introduction of specific immunoreactive staining, such chemical indicators of enzymatic activity were commonplace.Following the advent of the electron microscope, the ultrastructure of many cell types was vigorously investigated. Subsequently eosinophil peroxidase was found to be localized to primary and secondary granules of the eosinophil.|$|E
50|$|Dewar's {{reputation}} for providing original solutions to vexing puzzles first developed {{when he was}} still a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Oxford. In 1945, he deduced the correct structure for stipitatic acid, a mould product whose structure had baffled the leading chemists of the day. It involved a new kind of aromatic structure with a seven-membered ring for which Dewar coined the term tropolone. The discovery of the tropolone structure launched the field of non-benzenoid aromaticity, which witnessed feverish activity for several decades and greatly expanded the chemists' understanding of cyclic π-electron systems. Also in 1945, Dewar devised the then novel notion of a π complex, which he proposed as an intermediate in the <b>benzidine</b> rearrangement. This offered the first correct rationalisation of the electronic structure of complexes of transition metals with alkenes, later known as the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model.|$|E
