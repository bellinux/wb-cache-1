5|$|Although as a British subject Singh's primary {{interest}} was women's rights in England, {{she and her}} fellow suffragettes also promoted similar activities in the colonies. She valued her Indian heritage, but was not <b>bound</b> <b>by</b> allegiance to a single nation and supported the women's cause {{in a number of}} countries. Her title, Princess, was useful. Singh sold a suffragette newspaper outside Hampton Court Palace, where Queen Victoria had allowed her family to live.

Darejan had been skeptical of Georgia's rapprochement with its northern neighbour already in Heraclius's lifetime, especially after the Russians, <b>bound</b> <b>by</b> the 1783 treaty of Georgievsk to protect Heraclius's kingdom from external threat, had left the Georgians {{to their own devices}} {{in the face of a}} disastrous invasion from Iran in 1795.

5|$|Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd, (Baxter) was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 29 August 2007 that Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited, a tenderer for various government contracts, was <b>bound</b> <b>by</b> the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA, Australian legislation governing anti-competitive behaviour) in its trade and commerce in tendering for government contracts.

50|$|Dimensional analogy {{also helps}} in {{inferring}} basic properties {{of objects in}} higher dimensions. For example, two-dimensional objects are <b>bounded</b> <b>by</b> one-dimensional boundaries: a square is <b>bounded</b> <b>by</b> four edges. Three-dimensional objects are <b>bounded</b> <b>by</b> two-dimensional surfaces: a cube is <b>bounded</b> <b>by</b> 6 square faces. By applying dimensional analogy, one may infer that a four-dimensional cube, known as a tesseract, is <b>bounded</b> <b>by</b> three-dimensional volumes. And indeed, this is the case: mathematics shows that the tesseract is <b>bounded</b> <b>by</b> 8 cubes. Knowing this is key to understanding how to interpret a three-dimensional projection of the tesseract. The boundaries of the tesseract project to volumes in the image, not merely two-dimensional surfaces.|$|R
