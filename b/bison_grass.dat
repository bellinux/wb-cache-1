5000|$|Bison are herbivores and eat simple foods. They {{generally}} rest {{during the}} day and graze in the mornings and the evenings. The bison's main foodstuff is grass and sedges, though they will also eat any available low-lying shrubbery. In the winter, <b>bison</b> forage for <b>grass</b> under the snow. If little grass is available, they will eat the twigs of shrubs. Bison are notably better browsers than cattle, since cattle are more obligate grazers, though wood bison have also been described as [...] "obligate grazers". Wisent tend to browse on shrubs and low-hanging trees more often than do the American <b>bison,</b> which prefer <b>grass</b> to shrubbery and trees.|$|R
30|$|Yet more is {{at stake}} than simple ignition: fire can spread only if it has fuel. This is where {{humanity}} again flexes its firepower because we can make fuel and do so plentifully. Over most of the Earth fire burns {{within the context of}} agriculture, of fire-fallow farming or fire-forage herding. (And if there isn’t enough living biomass around, we excavate fossil biomass.) Fire burns, that is, because a creature creates the proper conditions. Other species bash and chew their environments into more suitable habitats for themselves. We shape our surroundings with fire, or to make fire possible. Slash-and-burn cultivation is no less biologically driven than elephants trashing acacias or <b>bison</b> nibbling bunch <b>grass</b> and not junipers.|$|R
50|$|At their peak, between {{thirty and}} forty million bison roamed the Great Bison Belt. Bison are {{excellent}} thermo-regulators, and successfully endured the harshest environmental conditions. The protein to carbohydrate ratio {{in the short}} grass provided an ideal diet for large numbers of bison. Humans had largely destroyed the megafauna of North America, eliminating the resource competition of bison. The droppings and grazing of the <b>bison</b> supported healthy <b>grass</b> maintenance, and prevented the intrusion of taller <b>grasses.</b> The Great <b>Bison</b> Belt supported numerous species and complex ecosystems. For instance, the bison were so plentiful that by the early 19th century, {{it is estimated that}} about 1.5 million wolves lived on the Great Bison Belt, feeding largely on the bison.|$|R

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{structure of}} the mammoth steppe fauna remains quite unclear. Stable isotope bio-geochemistry of fossil collagen can help determining the discrimination in food resources among different herbivorous species, {{due to differences in}} carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures in plants. Especially differences in nitrogen sources for different plants, such as grass, bushes and heather, lead to distinct isotopic signatures. Mammoths present more carbon- 13 -depleted and nitr-ogen- 15 -enriched collagen when compared to other herbivorous species, in all studied sites in Europe, Siberia and Alaska. One interpretation is that these isotopic differences reflect different dietary choices by herbivores, reindeer browsing on lichens, horse, woolly rhinoceros and <b>bison</b> grazing fresh <b>grass,</b> and mammoth consuming dry grass, with higher nitrogen- 15 content than other plant resources. The low carbon- 13 amounts of mammoth collagen might be due to fat utili-sation in this species. This distinction between different herbivorous species leads to the potential to identify prey species of predators, including humans...|$|R
40|$|Western Canadian bison meat {{is renowned}} for its natural healthfulness; however, studies on the dietary effects on the fatty acid (FA) profile are limited. Herein, we {{evaluated}} the FA profiles of retail bison (longissimus dorsi) representing grain-fed (Grain), grass-fed (Grass) and grass-fed plus oat and pea screening supplement from early (Early-con) or late (Late-con) season harvested finishing regimes. Bison meat contained less than 30 mg fat/g meat, and was lowest for Early-con bison. Proportions of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) were greatest in Early-con and lowest for Late-con bison. Early-con bison had the greatest proportion of omega- 6 (n- 6) FA and Late-con bison the lowest, yet as mg/g meat, total n- 6 content did not differ. In contrast, <b>Grass</b> and Early-con <b>bison</b> had greater proportions of 18 : 3 n- 3, 20 : 5 n- 3, 22 : 5 n- 3, 22 : 6 n- 3 and total omega- 3 (n- 3) FA. The n- 3 content for Grain, Grass, Early-con and Late-con bison were 38, 90, 69 and 69 mg/ 100 g meat, respectively. The 3 : 1 n- 6 /n- 3 ratios of Grass, Early-con and Late-con bison were superior to the 7 : 1 ratio of Grain bison. Proportions of potentially beneficial biohydrogenation intermediates (BI), including t 11 - 18 : 1 and c 9, t 11 -conjugated linoleic acid, were greater for Early-con and Late-con bison. Proportions of cis-monounsaturated FA were similar for both Grain and Grass bison; however, Late-con was greater than Early-con <b>bison.</b> Cumulatively, <b>Grass,</b> Early-con and Late-con bison were more desirable compared to Grain on account of greater proportions of n- 3 FA and a lowe...|$|R
5000|$|Cinnamon brandy concoctions, called [...] "cinnamon liqueur" [...] {{and made}} with {{distilled}} alcohol, are popular {{in parts of}} Greece. In Europe, popular examples of such beverages are Maiwein (white wine with woodruff) and Żubrówka (vodka flavoured with <b>bison</b> <b>grass).</b>|$|E
50|$|The words Zubrouka in Belarusian {{language}} and Zubrovka in Russian {{are the words}} for <b>bison</b> <b>grass.</b> In Polish, the word Turówka {{is used for the}} grass. The name comes from zubr (żubr, pronounced zhubr), the word for the European bison in many Slavic languages.|$|E
5000|$|Żubrówka [...] (Зубровка, Zubrovka; Зуброўка, Zubroŭka), {{also known}} in English as <b>Bison</b> <b>Grass</b> Vodka, is a dry, herb-flavoured vodka that is {{distilled}} from rye and bottled at 40% alcohol by volume (80 US proof). Its flavour {{is unique and}} is described as having woodruff, vanilla, coconut, and almond notes.|$|E
50|$|The {{tincture}} of <b>bison</b> <b>grass</b> {{found in}} Żubrówka is prohibited {{as a food}} additive by the Food and Drug Administration because it contains coumarin, which showed hepatotoxic effects in rats and has a blood thinning effect. Importation of Żubrówka was banned in 1978 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Canada has no similar regulations on coumarin, so the alcoholic drink is legal there.|$|E
50|$|Hierochloe odorata or Anthoxanthum nitens (commonly {{known as}} sweet grass, manna grass, Mary’s grass, or vanilla grass, and as holy {{grass in the}} UK, <b>bison</b> <b>grass</b> in Poland) is an {{aromatic}} herb native to northern Eurasia and North America. It is used in herbal medicine and {{in the production of}} distilled beverages (e.g., Żubrówka, Wisent). It owes its distinctive sweet scent to the presence of coumarin. This variety of grass is different from the species commonly known as buffalo grass (Stenotaphrum secundatum) in Australia.|$|E

Varieties of flavored vodka that match well with [...] include [...] (<b>bison</b> <b>grass),</b> [...] (juniper), [...] (wormwood), [...] (various herbs) and [...] (oak-aged). If served {{at home or in}} a restaurant, the stew may be washed down with beer, red wine or Riesling.|$|E
50|$|While most vodkas are unflavored, many flavored vodkas {{have been}} {{produced}} in traditional vodka-drinking areas, often as home-made recipes to improve vodka's taste or for medicinal purposes. Flavorings include red pepper, ginger, fruit flavors, vanilla, chocolate (without sweetener), and cinnamon. In Russia, vodka flavored with honey and pepper, pertsovka in Russian, is also very popular. In Poland and Belarus, {{the leaves of the}} local <b>bison</b> <b>grass</b> are added to produce żubrówka (Polish) and zubrovka (Belarusian) vodka, with slightly sweet flavors and light amber colors. In Lithuania and Poland, a famous vodka containing honey is called krupnik.|$|E
5000|$|Coumarin {{is often}} found in {{artificial}} vanilla substitutes, despite having been banned as a food additive in numerous countries since the mid-20th century. Coumarin was banned as a food additive in the United States in 1954, {{largely because of the}} hepatotoxicity results in rodents. Coumarin is currently listed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States among [...] "Substances Generally Prohibited From Direct Addition or Use as Human Food", according to 21 CFR 189.130, but some natural additives containing coumarin, such as the flavorant sweet woodruff are allowed [...] "in alcoholic beverages only" [...] (21 CFR 172.510). In Europe, popular examples of such beverages are Maiwein (white wine with woodruff) and Żubrówka (vodka flavoured with <b>bison</b> <b>grass).</b>|$|E
50|$|Ukrainian {{tradition}} has also produced various derivatives of horilka. Some {{of these are}} available as commercial products, but most are typically home-made. This includes various kinds of fruit infusion, nalyvka and spiced spotykach: malynivka made with raspberries, tertukha (strawberries), agrusivka (gooseberries), ternivka (blackthorn berries), kalynivka (snowball tree), shypshynnyk (rose hips), horobynivka (ashberries), zubrivka (<b>bison</b> <b>grass),</b> vyshnyak or vyshnivka from cherries, slyv”yanka (plums), morelivka (apricots), tsytrynivka (lemons), mokrukha (oranges and cloves), mochena (citrus rind), kontabas (blackcurrant buds). Horikhivka is flavoured with nuts. Horilka is also made with honey (called Medova), mint, or even milk. In some cases whole fruits of red peppers (capsicum) are put into the bottle, turning horilka {{into a sort of}} bitters; it is then named horilka z pertsem, or pertsivka. (One should be mindful of the usage: horilka z pertsem refers to horilka bottled with hot chilli peppers, whereas pertsivka typically refers to horilka spiced with the essence of pepper. Horilka z pertsem always refers to a Ukrainian spirit, whereas Pertsivka or Pertsovka may refer to Russian vodka.) Medova z pertsem is the combination of horilka with chili peppers and honey.|$|E
