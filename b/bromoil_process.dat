50|$|The oil {{print and}} <b>bromoil</b> <b>processes</b> create soft images {{reminiscent}} of paint or pastels {{but with the}} distinctive indexicality of a photograph. For this reason, they were popular with the Pictorialists {{during the first half}} of the twentieth century. The painterly qualities of the prints continue to appeal to artists and have recently led some contemporary art photographers to take up these processes again.|$|R

50|$|The <b>bromoil</b> <b>process</b> is a {{variation}} on the oil print process that allows for enlargements. In 1907, E.J. Wall described how it should theoretically be possible to place a negative in an enlarger to produce a larger silver bromide positive, which would then be bleached, hardened, and inked following the oil print process. That same year C. Welborne Piper worked out the practical details. Much as Wall envisioned it, the <b>bromoil</b> <b>process</b> starts with a normally developed print exposed onto a silver-bromide paper that is then chemically bleached, hardened, and fixed. When the still-moist print is inked, the hardest (driest) areas take up the most ink while the wettest areas become the highlights.|$|E

50|$|An {{issue with}} the <b>bromoil</b> <b>process</b> is that {{inadequate}} rinsing of the chrome salts can lead to discoloration of the prints when exposed to light {{over long periods of}} time. In addition, irregularities in the thickness of the gelatin layer can, under unfavorable conditions, lead to stresses that damage the pictorial (ink) layer.|$|E
50|$|A {{significant}} {{drawback to}} the oil print process is that it requires the negative {{to be the same}} size as the final print because the medium isn't sensitive enough to light to make use of an enlarger. A subtype of the oil print process, the <b>bromoil</b> <b>process,</b> was developed in the early 20th century to solve this problem.|$|E
50|$|He {{continued}} to explore further ways to manipulate his images, and by 1911 he had perfected the modern <b>bromoil</b> <b>process.</b> This {{allowed him to}} become even bolder in his visual style, and soon his works attracted a broad international audience. Over {{the next two years}} he exhibited in Paris, Vienna and New York, as well as London.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1920s, Adams {{experimented with}} soft-focus, etching, <b>bromoil</b> <b>process,</b> and other {{techniques}} of the pictorial photographers, such as Photo-Secession leader Alfred Stieglitz who strove to put photography on an equal artistic plane with painting by trying to mimic it. However, Adams steered clear of hand-coloring which was also popular at the time. He {{used a variety of}} lenses to get different effects but eventually rejected pictorialism for a more realistic approach which relied more heavily on sharp focus, heightened contrast, precise exposure, and darkroom craftsmanship.|$|E

50|$|Vladimír Jindřich Bufka (16 July 1887, Pavlovice u Kojetína - 23 May 1916, Prague) was a Czech {{photographer}} and popularizer of photography {{as well as}} an important exponent of pictorialism in Czech photography during the early 20th century. Bufka's creative works span a wide range; he practiced landscape photography, architectural photography, photojournalism, still life photography, portrait photography, astrophotography and photomicrography. He was familiar with various photography techniques of the time including gum bichromate, platinum print, <b>bromoil</b> <b>process</b> and autochrome. He also gave lectures and seminars on photography, contributed to various specialized magazines and published a number of books. He died of leukemia at the age of 28.|$|E
5000|$|In 1903 Dubreuil was {{admitted}} {{as a member}} to the Linked Ring Brotherhood in London. This put Dubreuil among the ranks of Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, F. Holland Day, Frederick H. Evans, and Gertrude Käsebier. In 1904 he began using the <b>bromoil</b> <b>process,</b> which he favored until 1930. This versatile process gave Dubreuil the freedom to control contrast and darken and lighten portions of prints at will. Dubreuil took this new printing process to Paris, where he was influenced by Cubism and Futurism; {{he became one of}} the first photographers to explore Modernism in the medium, preceding Alvin Langdon Coburn's [...] "The Octopus" [...] (1912) and the Modernist works of Paul Strand.|$|E
5000|$|Fiber-based (FB or Baryta) {{photographic}} papers {{consist of}} a paper base coated with baryta. Tints are sometimes added to the baryta to add subtle colour to the final print; however most modern papers use optical brighteners to extend the paper's tonal range. [...] Most fiber-based papers include a clear hardened gelatin layer above the emulsion which protects it from physical damage, especially during processing. This is called a supercoating. Papers without a supercoating are suitable for use with the <b>bromoil</b> <b>process.</b> Fiber-based papers are generally chosen as a medium for high-quality prints for exhibition, display and archiving purposes. These papers require careful processing and handling, especially when wet. However, they are easier to tone, hand-colour and retouch than resin-coated equivalents.|$|E
5000|$|What Bodine {{did in his}} {{darkroom}} {{he taught}} himself by experimentation; {{much of what he}} did was unorthodox. He mixed chemicals by intuition that came from experience, not by following directions on the container. Chemicals recommended by the manufacturer for certain conditions he used in other ways. [...] Bodine used a variety of processes. At one time the PSA circulated a one-man Bodine show that included eleven different photographic processes. Among them were carbros, gum bromides, multiple gums, the <b>bromoil</b> <b>process,</b> paper negatives and carbon prints. Finished exhibition prints from his early period are predominantly in non-silver processes, particularly carbro, bromoil, and gum bichromate, and on a variety of paper surfaces. Heavy manipulation of the negative and final print is evident in his work.|$|E
50|$|Although he did {{not possess}} a {{consistent}} style, Koppitz was a virtuoso of the dark room, seemingly determined to make the photograph {{as much of an}} art object as possible. His beautifully grainy, subtly tinted images align him with American Pictorialists like Edward Steichen and Clarence Smith. Koppitz's work, much of it using the gum bichromate process, reflected his links with modern artists such as Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele, and their involvement with the 'life reform' movement including; nudism, sun culture, and expressive dance popular in Central Europe from the early 1900s as well as agrarian romanticism. Koppitz's extraordinary mastery of pictorial processes—pigment, carbon, gum, and <b>bromoil</b> <b>process</b> of transfer printing—gained the respect of his colleagues throughout the world and garnered mention in the Encyclopædia Britannica of 1929.|$|E
50|$|A {{version of}} the <b>bromoil</b> <b>process</b> was {{developed}} to produce full-color prints in the 1930s before commercial color film was developed. This technique requires three matching negatives of the subject, each made on Ilford Hypersensitive Panchromatic plates and shot through a blue, green, and red filter. The developed plates are enlarged and printed onto separate pieces of bromide-silver photographic paper, which are then bleached and hardened in the usual manner. The three prints are then inked with a firm bromoil ink, yellow on the blue-filtered print, red on the green-filtered print, and blue on the red-filtered print. The three inked prints are then treated as printing plates and passed through an etching press that will transfer the ink to {{a new piece of}} paper or cloth, reversing the image in the process. Care must be taken to maintain exact registration of the three plates.|$|E
50|$|He {{made many}} inventions {{in the field}} of photography. Małachowski, first {{developed}} in 1875 the camera system, which acted like modern cameras. His system was based on the photosensitive layer of dry collodion imposed on the paper covered with a layer of gum arabic. After exposure, the layer of collodion was through a complex process, transferred to a glass substrate. This material is also suitable for printing positive. Photosensitive material in a roll was placed in a special cartridge which allows to perform up to 100 photos. The design of this camera was based on entirely new solutions that allow {{for the first time to}} perform such a large number of images on a single cartridge is loaded. Unfortunately, high production costs have prevented the proliferation of these films and their disposal.Małachowski in 1880 invented the first practical sensitometer, which allows measurement of the speed of photographic materials.He also discovered the phenomenon of tanning the exposed parts gelatin emulsion by pyro developer, which later found its application in <b>Bromoil</b> <b>Process.</b> Malachowski has developed the basic concepts of this photographic technique for which he was awarded the Progress Medal of the Photographic Society of Great Britain (known as Royal Photographic Society today) in 1882.|$|E
