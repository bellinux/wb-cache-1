50|$|<b>Binedaline</b> (Ixprim), {{also called}} binodaline, {{is a drug}} that was being {{investigated}} as an antidepressant in the 1980s but never marketed. It acts as a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (Ki = 25 nM), with relatively insignificant influence on the serotonin (Ki = 847 nM) and dopamine (Ki >= 2 µM) transporters. It has negligible affinity for the α-adrenergic, mACh, H1, or 5-HT2 receptors.|$|E

In receptor binding as did 5 -HT 2 receptors and benzodiazepine receptors. In contrast assays, <b>binedaline</b> was compared to amitnptyline, imipramine, a prolonged treatment with maprotiline (20 mg/kg i. p.) increased maprotiline and mianserin.

Our results indicate that <b>binedaline</b> is daline and desmethylbinedaline were potent inhibitors of the comparable to a tricyclic antidepressant drug in inhibiting the uptake of norepinephrine in synaptosomes from rat cerebral norepinephrine uptake but, however, it is devoid of affinity forneurotransmitter receptors.

These results also suggest that a reduction in beta as an inhibitor of dopamine uptake in synaptosomes from rat adrenergic, 5 -HT 2 or benzodiazepine receptors is not always stnatum (K,> 2 tM).
