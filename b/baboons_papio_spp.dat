50|$|A {{traditional}} view of multi-male primate {{groups is}} held that males provide relatively little direct care to infants, possibly {{as a result}} of the low confidence of paternity that is associated with this relatively promiscuous breeding system. In the last five years this view has changed however, {{as a result of}} a careful documentation of intimate male-infant affiliations in certain species, especially the savanna-dwelling <b>baboons</b> (<b>Papio</b> <b>spp.).</b> Recent field studies of baboons suggest that male-infant relationships are mediated through affiliations between the males and the infants' mothers, but the degree to which these male-female affiliations are based on prior mating experience (hence, paternity) has not been established. Comparative studies of male-infant relations in primates have given little attention to the variation in the intensity and form of male care patterns within the set of species that have a multi-male social organization. Among multi-male species, male care of young is reported most often in baboons and barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) and least often in other macaques, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus). This interspecific variation may result both from differences in the importance of male care to infant survival and from differences in male confidence of paternity, which in turn may relate to seasonal breeding patterns and, in particular, to the presence or absence of conspicuous signs of ovulation in females.|$|E
50|$|Being a large, ground-dwelling bird species, the {{kori bustard}} is {{vulnerable}} to many of Africa's myriad of formidable terrestrial predators. Leopards (Panthera pardus), caracals (Caracal caracal), cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), lions (Panthera leo), spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), African rock pythons (Python sebae), jackals (Canis spp.), Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii), martial eagles (Polemaetus bellicosus), and Verreaux's eagle-owls (Bubo lacteus) are amongst their potential natural predators. Additionally, warthogs (Phacochoerus spp.), tawny eagles (Aquila rapax), Cape eagle-owls (Bubo capensis), mongooses and <b>baboons</b> (<b>Papio</b> <b>spp.)</b> may eat eggs, small chicks, {{and in the case}} of the tawny eagle and the Cape eagle-owl sometimes adults. When alarmed, kori bustards make barking calls and bend forward and spread their tail and wings to appear larger. Adults will growl when their young are threatened by predators. Chicks tend to be the most vulnerable to predators by far. Many, despite their cryptic camouflage and the mother's defenses, are regularly picked off by jackals and leopards at night. Up to 82% of kori bustard chicks die in their first year of life. When found with carmine bee-eaters, the smaller birds may incidentally provide some protection from predators due to their vigilance. The display of the adult male may make it more conspicuous to larger predators, such as hyenas or lions. A shock display may be performed when a bird is alarmed. While too large to be prey for most predatory birds, it is known that the martial eagle is a serious natural enemy even for adult bustards. In one documented attack by a martial eagle on an adult kori bustard, both birds ended up wounded, the eagle with a bleeding leg from the bustard's counterattack, but the bustard more seriously injured, with a broken wing and several open wounds. Although it walked away, the injured bustard in the confrontation was found dead the next morning, being fed on by a jackal.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: How {{an animal}} moves through its {{environment}} directly impacts its survival, reproduction, and thus biological fitness. A basic measure describing how an individual (or group) travels through its environment is Day Path Length (DPL), i. e., the distance travelled in a 24 -hour period. Here, we investigate the ecological determinants of <b>baboon</b> (<b>Papio</b> <b>spp.)</b> troop DPL and movements at local and continental scales. RESULTS: At the continental scale we explore the ecological determinants of annual mean DPL for 47 baboon troops across 23 different populations, updating a classic study by Dunbar (Behav Ecol Sociobiol 31 : 35 - 49, 1992). We find that variation in baboon DPLs is predicted by ecological dissimilarity across the genus range. Troops that experience higher average monthly rainfall and anthropogenic influences have significantly shorter DPL, whilst troops {{that live in}} areas with higher average annual temperatures have significantly longer DPL. We then explore DPLs and movement characteristics (the speed and distribution of turning angles) for yellow <b>baboons</b> (<b>Papio</b> cynocephalus) at a local scale, in the Issa Valley of western Tanzania. We show that our continental-scale model is a good predictor of DPL in Issa baboons, and that troops move significantly slower, and over shorter distances, on warmer days. We do not find any effect of season or the abundance of fruit resources on the movement characteristics or DPL of Issa baboons, but find that baboons moved less during periods of high fruit availability. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study emphasises the ability of baboons to adapt their ranging behaviour {{to a range of}} ecological conditions and highlights how investigations of movement patterns at different spatial scales can provide a more thorough understanding of the ecological determinants of movement...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSimian virus 40 (SV 40) is a polyomavirus {{for which}} {{non-human}} primates are the permissive host. The <b>baboon</b> (<b>Papio</b> <b>spp.)</b> {{is an old}} world monkey that is used {{in a variety of}} research investigations; however, natural infection of SV 40 among baboons has not been thoroughly examined or reported. Initially, we were interested in determining the prevalence of SV 40 infection among a captive colony of baboons based on the presence of antibodies to SV 40 large T-antigen (Tag). An overall seroprevalence rate of > 50 % was found after screening sera from 142 baboons in the colony based on ELISA. Endpoint titer values for serum antibody binding to SV 40 Tag reached as high as 1280 for 5 out of 142 baboons. Peptide binding assays revealed that a range of SV 40 Tag epitopes are immunogenic in the baboon, and that individual animals differ in their humoral immune responses to SV 40 Tag based on epitope recognition. Specificity to SV 40 Tag and not some other primate polyomavirus encoded large Tag was further examined by serologic reactivity to peptide epitopes unique to SV 40 Tag. Additional serology was performed to assess SV 40 Tag reactivity by Western blot and whether antibodies were capable of neutralizing SV 40 infectivity in vitro. Although antibodies with high levels of SV 40 neutralization were observed in a number of the baboons, {{there was a lack of}} correlation between viral neutralization and antibodies to SV 40 Tag. Further examination using molecular-based diagnosis and SV 40 Tag specific real-time quantitative PCR determined that some of the baboons appeared to be exposed to SV 40. DNA sequence analysis of the PCR products confirmed that SV 40 Tag specific sequences were detected in baboons...|$|R

The animals {{were divided into}} two age groups: a young age group (6. 63 ± 0. 6 years) and an old age group (26. 96 ± 1. 3 years). Seven specimens per group were monotonically loaded to failure to determine their {{mechanical properties}}. The quasistatic strength of the bone for the old group was just a little (but not significantly) lower than the young group. High strain rate tests performed with the Hopkinson bar indicate that baboon bone from the older group was significantly weaker under impact loads than that from the younger group. This observation is particularly important due to the similarities between baboon and human bone tissue. Typical strain rates for these tests ranged from 130 s− 1 to 250 s− 1. A full-size 3 -D simulation of the Hopkinson bar test was performed to confirm that the bone specimen was under stress equilibrium and to evaluate the consistency of the modulus and strength inferred from the tests. Simulations were performed in which the modulus, strength and failure strain were varied to see the sensitivity of the results. Additionally, simplified simulations were performed to estimate the strain rate environment of a femur during a fall at an impact velocity of 5 m/s, similar to a free fall velocity from a height of 1. 3 meters.

40|$|Abstract. Kinship is {{commonly}} inferred from behaviour in primate field studies, but {{the validity of}} such inferences {{has not yet been}} documented. A comparison of the relationships of six three-year-old yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus) females with 14 adult females howed that when a juvenile's mother was living she could easily be identified from behavioural data. The most useful behaviour in this context was Presenting For Grooming. When the mother was not living, however, the juvenile compen-sated by forming a strong relationship with a less closely related or unrelated adult female. If com-pensation also occurs in other populations and other species, past attempts to infer kinship from behaviour have probably included afew cases in which a female was incorrectly identified as a juvenile's mother. Multivariate statistical techniques revealed ifferences between mother-daughter r lationships and strong relationships based on compensation among other individuals. These differences involved comparisons of the frequencies of certain behaviours (frequency of Grooming by adult versus fre-quency of Grooming by juvenile, frequency of Grooming versus frequency of aggression) as well as the magnitudes of frequencies (amount of Grooming, number of Interventions). In field studies of primates, the identity of an individual's mother is often inferred from ob-served behavioural relationships.

40|$|Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are ecologically {{flexible}} omnivores {{with broad}} diets comprising many {{plant and animal}} foods, although they mostly eat fruit (including figs). Like other ecologically flexible nonhuman primates (e. g., <b>baboons,</b> <b>Papio</b> <b>spp.)</b> with broad diets, their diets vary across habitats. Much data on diets come from short studies that may not capture the range of variation, however, and data are scant on variation within habitats and populations. We present data on diet composition and diversity for chimpanzees at Ngogo, in Kibale National Park, Uganda, collected over a 15 -year period, {{with a focus on}} the plant components of the diet. We compare Ngogo data to those on chimpanzees at the nearby Kibale site of Kanyawara, on other chimpanzee populations, and on some other frugivorous–omnivorous primates. Results support the argument that chimpanzees are ripe fruit specialists: Ngogo chimpanzees ate a broad, mostly fruit-based diet, feeding time devoted to fruit varied positively with fruit availability, and diet diversity varied inversely with fruit availability. Comparison of Ngogo and Kanyawara shows much similarity, but also pronounced within-population dietary variation. Chimpanzees fed much more on leaves, and much less on pith and stems, at Ngogo. Figs accounted for somewhat less feeding time at Ngogo, but those of Ficus mucuso were quantitatively the most important food.

Following the outbreak, blood samples were collected from 1, 692 captive rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), pigtail macaques (M. nemestrina), and <b>baboons</b> (<b>Papio</b> <b>spp.)</b> that were permanently housed outdoors at a nonhuman primate breeding facility in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana. The serum samples were examined for antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV). Overall, 36 % of the captive nonhuman primates had WNV antibodies; comparison of these samples with banked serum samples from previous blood collections indicated that the animals were infected subclinically from February to August 2002. WNV activity was demonstrated in surveillance at the nonhuman primate-breeding colony and in the neighboring community during this same period. The high infection rate in this captive nonhuman primate population illustrates the intensity of WNV transmission that can occur silently in nature among other susceptible vertebrates during epidemic periods.

Nonhuman primates are also frequently the model of choice for preclinical testing of new immunosuppressive strategies. But the management of post-transplant nonhuman primates is complex, because it often involves multiple immunosuppressive agents, {{many of which are}} new and have unknown effects. Additionally, the resulting immunosuppression carries a risk of infectious complications, which are challenging to diagnose. Last, be-cause of the natural tendency of animals to hide signs of weakness, infectious complications may not be obvious un-til the animal becomes severely ill. For these reasons the diagnosis of infectious complications is difficult among post-transplant NHPs. Because most nonhuman primate studies in organ transplantation are quite small, {{there are only a few}} published reports concerning infections after transplantation in nonhuman primates. Based on our survey of these reports, the incidence of infection in NHP trans-plant models is 14 %. The majority of reports suggest that many of these infections are due to reactivation of viruses endemic to the primate species, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), polyomavirus, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) – related infections. In this review, we address the epidemi-ology, pathogenesis, role of prophylaxis, clinical presentation, and treatment of infectious complications after solid organ transplantation in nonhuman primates.

40|$|Plio-Pleistocene {{environmental}} change influenced the evolutionary history of many animal lineages in Africa, highlighting key roles for both climate and tectonics {{in the evolution}} of Africa’s faunal diversity. Here, we explore diversification in the southern African chacma baboon Papio ursinus sensu lato and reveal a dominant role for increasingly arid landscapes during past glacial cycles in shaping contemporary genetic structure. Recent work on <b>baboons</b> (<b>Papio</b> <b>spp.)</b> supports complex lineage structuring with a dominant pulse of diversification occurring 1 - 2 Ma, and yet the link to palaeo{{environmental change}} remains largely untested. Phylogeographic reconstruction based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data supports a scenario where chacma baboon populations were likely restricted to refugia during periods of regional cooling and drying through the Late Pleistocene. The two lineages of chacma baboon, ursinus and griseipes, are strongly geographically structured, and demographic reconstruction together with spatial analysis of genetic variation point to possible climate-driven isolating events where baboons may have retreated to more optimum conditions during cooler, drier periods. Our analysis highlights a period of continuous population growth beginning in the Middle to Late Pleistocene in both the ursinus and the PG 2 griseipes lineages. All three clades identified in the study then enter a state of declining population size (Ne f) through to the Holocene; this is particularly marked in the last 20, 000 years, most likely coincident with the Last Glacial Maximum. The pattern recovered here conforms to expectations based on the dynamic regional climate trends in southern Africa through the Pleistocene and provides further support for complex patterns of diversification in the region’s biodiversity...|$|E

On the basis of 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarities, both strains, which possessed identical sequences, {{were assigned to the}} genus Brucella. This placement was confirmed by extended multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA), where both strains possessed identical sequences, and whole-genome sequencing of a representative isolate. All of the above analyses suggested that the two strains represent a novel lineage within the genus Brucella. The strains also possessed a unique profile when subjected to the phenotyping approach classically used to separate species of the genus Brucella, reacting only with Brucella A monospecific antiserum, being sensitive to the dyes thionin and fuchsin, being lysed by bacteriophage Wb, Bk 2 and Fi phage at routine test dilution (RTD) but only partially sensitive to bacteriophage Tb, and with no requirement for CO 2 and no production of H 2 S but strong urease activity. Biochemical profiling revealed a pattern of enzyme activity and metabolic capabilities distinct from existing species of the genus Brucella. Molecular analysis of the omp 2 locus genes showed that both strains had a novel combination of two highly similar omp 2 b gene copies. The two strains shared a unique fingerprint profile of the multiple-copy Brucella-specific element IS 711. Like MLSA, a multilocus variable number of tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) showed that the isolates clustered together very closely, but represent a distinct group within the genus Brucella. Isolates F 8 / 08 - 60 (T) and F 8 / 08 - 61 could be distinguished clearly from all known species of the genus Brucella and their biovars by both phenotypic and molecular properties. Therefore, by applying the species concept for the genus Brucella suggested by the ICSP Subcommittee on the Taxonomy of Brucella, they represent a novel species within the genus Brucella, for which the name Brucella papionis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain F 8 / 08 - 60 (T) ( = NCTC 13660 (T)  = CIRMBP 0958 (T)) ...|$|E

In Cheha Woreda District of Guraghe Zone, a research team from the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research, Holetta Research Center, is undertaking a watershed-level intervention to improve sustainable land management practices among resident agrarian families. In 2011, a household survey was conducted to assess farmers’ perceptions of human–wildlife conflicts (HWC) {{and the effects of}} these conflicts on land management in Cheha Woreda. One-hundred randomly selected households in the Cheha Woreda were asked to identify any wild or domestic animals that cause damage to their crops. Additionally, respondents were asked to gauge the extent of the damages; the direct and indirect social, economic, and environmental impacts; and the overall trends in the area’s wildlife populations. In addition to the household survey, 3 focus group discussions were held to capture farmers’ perceptions. The findings show that Grivet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops), crested porcupines (Hystrix cristata), <b>baboons</b> (<b>Papio</b> <b>spp.),</b> antelopes (Gazella spp.), warthogs (Phacochoerus sp.), and wild pigs (Sus sp.) were the major crop raiders in the area, while spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), foxes (Vulpes sp.), eagles (Accipitridae) and Ethiopian ratels or honey badgers (Mellivora capensis) were the most common livestock predators. More than 90 % of the households reported that they faced damages to their property by these species. Additionally, about 55 % of the respondents reported a high severity of crop damage, with monkeys alleged to be the greatest culprits. Respondents perceived that HWC have resulted in significant vegetation removal, shifts in crop production, food shortages, and poverty in the study area. Eighty-eight percent of farmers reported believing that wild animals significantly contributed to the shortages of food for their family. The farmers were aware of several locally used management options, which they suggested could be used to reduce the negative impacts of the conflicts. We conclude that HWC and farmers’ perceptions of HWC in the Cheha Woreda have had and continue to have significant impacts on the social, economic, and environmental well-being of the area. Hence, different management options must be adopted to mediate the effects and minimize future conflicts...|$|E
40|$|<b>Baboons</b> (<b>Papio</b> <b>spp.)</b> are characterised by a {{large degree}} of {{variation}} in foraging behaviour and dietary composition. Previous analyses have suggested that much {{of this can be}} traced to differences in ecological conditions between sites. The proximate mechanism underlying these relationships is assumed to be mediated via the impact of climatic conditions on food availability, and ultimately the impact that this has on dietary composition. This paper examines these relationships more explicitly. Data from 15 baboon populations were used to assess the relationship between foraging variables and dietary composition. Only feeding time showed significant relationships with dietary composition, with percentage of time spent feeding decreasing with proportion of fruit in the diet, and increasing with the proportion of subterranean items. No relationships were found between diet composition and moving time or day journey length, although significant relationships were found between these variables and group size. The proportions of feeding time spent feeding on fruit, subterranean items and leaves were functions of the ecological conditions experienced by that population, although no relationships were found for the percentage of feeding time devoted to flowers or animal material. The relationships between the proportion feeding time spent on fruits, leaves and subterranean items and ecological variables could be best explained through understanding the way in which bush and tree level vegetation respond to the climatic environment and the impact this has on fruit availability. In this respect, temperature and seasonality are the key climatic parameters. This provides good support for the idea that the proximate mechanism underlying the relationship between foraging time and ecological variables is mediated via the impact of the climatic environment on vegetation structure and food availability. Similar factors have been proposed to explain much of the geographic variation in species diversity, suggesting that these relationships have far wider relevance and may account for much of the observed geographical variation in mammalian behaviour.
