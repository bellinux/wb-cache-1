5|$|It had <b>been</b> <b>also</b> conjectured {{that the}} double bond between carbons 4 and 5 of the imidazolium ring backbone, which gave {{aromatic}} character to that system, {{was important for}} the carbene's stability. This conjecture was disproved in 1995 by Arduengo's group, who obtained a derivative of dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene, lacking the double bond. The thermodynamical stability in this compound, {{and the role of}} steric protection in preventing dimerisation, has been a topic of some dispute.|$|E

5|$|The {{palatial}} structures at Mycenae, Tiryns and Pylos were erected on {{the summits}} of hills or rocky outcrops, dominating the immediate surroundings.

On the other hand, the palace built at the acropolis of Athens has been almost completely destroyed. A substantial building at Dimini in Thessaly, possibly ancient Iolcos, is believed {{by a number of}} archaeologists to be a palace. A Mycenaean palace has <b>been</b> <b>also</b> unearthed in Laconia, near the modern village of Xirokambi.|$|E

The absence of any mention of European involvement in the construction of Taman Sari in Dutch historic descriptions is presented as further evidence in support of this hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would have seen a new website opening on the internet, with the site videos appearing in people's dreams. The videos would have gone worldwide and end up trapping little kids in their own 'dream-world'. These 'dream-worlds' would have created a 'fantasy' beyond the universe for infant children. Sarah Jane, Clyde, Rani and Luke would have <b>been</b> <b>also</b> trapped in dream-world, and would be faced with an 'internet creature' who has seen them in their former adventures. This story was cancelled for various reasons, one of them being that the plot being similar to The Nightmare Man.|$|E
5|$|Bryant {{currently}} ranks third {{both on the}} league's all-time post-season {{scoring and}} all-time regular season scoring lists. He has been selected to 15 All-NBA Team (eleven times to the All-NBA First Team) and 12 All-Defensive Team (nine times to the All-Defensive First Team). He was selected {{to play in the}} NBA All-Star Game on 18 occasions, winning All-Star MVP Awards in 2002, 2007, 2009 and 2011 (he shared the 2009 award with Shaquille O'Neal).

5|$|HSA {{formed an}} {{agreement}} with the German Focke-Wulf aircraft company to collaborate on a joint study that looked into the issue of equipping the P.1150 with two additional lift engines. However, in October 1961, West Germany elected to entirely withdraw from participation in the programme. This was a blow that was directly felt not only by HSA and the development team, but by the British Air Ministry, who had <b>been</b> <b>also</b> seeking to collaborate with its West German counterparts on the matter of VTOL aircraft. Meanwhile, further studies served to confirmed fears that the P.1150 would be too small to meet customer specifications, and thus Camm initiated work on an enlarged derivative design. In conjunction with HSA's redesign, Bristol worked to enlarge the original PCB engine and raised the exhaust heat to increase thrust to 146.8kN (30,000lbf). It could have theoretically reach speeds of up to Mach1.7–2.|$|E

5|$|John Lavender of {{the local}} Red House Museum noted {{evidence}} of small iron-ore smelting hearths on Warren Hill, while green vitreous slag has <b>been</b> <b>also</b> found on the Head. In his 1911 to 1912 excavations, Bushe-Fox found evidence for working of lead, copper and silver; two ingots discovered at this time revealed that raw materials would have been imported to the area. One ingot was of nearly pure copper, while the other, which weighed 8.6kg, was roughly 50/50 copper-silver alloy with around one percent gold. Argentiferous (i.e. silver-bearing) copper was refined to produce silver at the Head. There are also indications that gold was worked at Hengistbury. One excavation produced part of a torc, twisted together with a small gold bracelet and another fragment in a manner suggesting it was scrap; a different site produced a streaked touchstone indicating use in gold testing.|$|E
5|$|Many coins {{have been}} found in {{northern}} Ethiopia and Eritrea, the central region of Aksum, though Aksumite coins are reported to {{have been found}} in Arato and Lalibela. Many coins have <b>been</b> <b>also</b> found further afield. Numerous hoards of coins (always gold save one silver coin) {{have been found in}} Southern Arabia, much more than in Aksum itself, attesting perhaps to an Aksumite presence in parts of the region (perhaps supporting the use of titles claiming control over parts of South Arabia from GDRT's time). The hoards may be the remnants of hoards left in Kaleb's time (perhaps used to pay soldiers), when it was under an Aksumite governor. Outside of the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula, coins have been found as far as Israel, Meroe, Egypt, and India. Silver and copper coins are mainly found in Aksum, though some can be traced to Palestinian pilgrim centers.|$|E
5|$|The inner Solar System's {{period of}} giant impacts {{probably}} {{played a role}} in the Earth acquiring its current water content (~6kg) from the early asteroid belt. Water is too volatile to have been present at Earth's formation and must have been subsequently delivered from outer, colder parts of the Solar System. The water was probably delivered by planetary embryos and small planetesimals thrown out of the asteroid belt by Jupiter. A population of main-belt comets discovered in 2006 has <b>been</b> <b>also</b> suggested as a possible source for Earth's water. In contrast, comets from the Kuiper belt or farther regions delivered not more than about 6% of Earth's water. The panspermia hypothesis holds that life itself may have been deposited on Earth in this way, although this idea is not widely accepted.|$|E
