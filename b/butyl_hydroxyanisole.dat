40|$|AbstractAn electroanalytical {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} detection and quantification of tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) and <b>butyl</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> (BHA) in biodiesel was developed using a voltammetric technique and screen-printed electrodes. The supporting electrolyte solution {{was composed of}} Britton–Robinson buffer (0. 04 molL− 1) containing methanol (2. 0 %) and the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). In the presence of CTAB, the peak current intensity and voltammetric resolution increased significantly for both studied antioxidants. Using the optimized conditions, the method presented a linear response in the concentration range of 5. 0 × 10 − 7 – 1. 0 × 10 − 5 molL− 1 for TBHQ (r= 0. 999) and BHA (r= 0. 999) with detection limits of 3. 40 × 10 − 7 molL− 1 and 1. 76 × 10 − 7 molL− 1, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied for the quantification of TBHQ and BHA in biodiesel samples after a simple and rapid dilution with recoveries from 97. 90 % to 110. 0 % and 91. 90 % to 101. 0 %, respectively. The obtained results were satisfactory when compared with those obtained using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Additionally, the proposed method can be easily adapted for on-site analysis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Several {{plants have}} been studied as {{potential}} sources of natural antioxidants {{for use in the}} food industry, especially polyphenols. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of hydroalcoholic extract from coffee husk on the oxidative stability of soybean oil when stored in an oven. Samples were maintained at a temperature of 60 °C and their oxidative stability was evaluated once every 5 days for a period of 20 days through the Rancimat equipament and analysis of peroxide value, conjugated dienes and tocopherols retention. The oxidation rate in terms of mass gain was evaluated once every 24 hours for a period of 24 days. Although the antioxidant TBHQ showed a better efficiency in the inhibition of oxidation, coffee husk extract showed a synergistic effect when used with the synthetic, delaying the appearance of degradation products. In addition, the freeze-dried extract showed the ability to reduce the mass-gain rate when used alone as well as when used in combination with the synthetic antioxidant <b>butyl</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> (BHA), noting a synergistic effect on oxidative stability between the extract and the BHA. Therefore, coffee husk extract could be considered a source of natural antioxidants for synthetic antioxidants substitution...|$|E
40|$|Meat {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} livestock products, for many people serves as their first source of animal protein. Rising demand for meat in developing countries combined with poor access to synthetic antioxidants necessary for proper food preservation along with their potential side-effects highlights the importance of feasible alternatives for rural populations. Among the most critical components that cause quality deterioration are the lipids and proteins oxidation, in time if not treated properly this will cause off-odor and off-flavor production in the meat, for that reason this dissertation focus on the application of Essential Oil (EO) as alternative to those more commonly used synthetic antioxidants like <b>butyl</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> (BHA) and butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) as pre-treatment of dehydrated meat, and its further effects if any during the drying process. Beef meat samples will be prepared, and tree different types of pretreatment will be studied along with a combination of three possibilities as concentration of Essential Oil, the three types of pre-treatment will be; Steam Blanching (SB), Hot Air Blanching (HAB) and Oil Treatment (OT), this were combined with different concentrations of Oregano EO, those were 1. 5 ml, 3 ml, and 6 ml. The approach will focus on finding if there was any correlation between the concentration of Oregano EO used versus the speed of drying and if there is any correlation between the different types of pretreatment applied...|$|E
40|$|Planting sterilized corn grains in soil, {{treated with}} the mold inhibitors Fix-a-tox (FAT) or Antitox Plus (AP) resulted, in cases, in dwarfed and malformed corn plants and in the {{development}} of deformed, bone-shaped and grain-free corn cobs. Moreover, treating corn grains with the mold inhibitors before storage for one month caused significant changes in some nutritional components of corn grains, i. e. proteins, aminoacids, crude fibers, moisture, fats, ash and carbohydrates. Insignificant differences in protein percetage were detected between control inoculated with Aspergillus flavus and those treated with <b>butyl</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> (BHA) antioxidant or FAT treatments, whereas ground clove significantly reduced protein content. In corn grains inoculated with Fusarium verticillioides, previous treatment with FAT resulted in significant reduction in the content of proline, aspartic acid, cysteine, valine, isoleucine and leucine, whereas treatment with BHA significantly reduced the content of threonine, serine, glutamic, glycine, alanine, phenylalanine and tyrosine. In Aspergillus flavus treatments, FAT significantly increased the content of methionine and threonine, whereas, aspartic acid showed 26 percentage decreases, compared to the control. Pronounced reductions in threonine, isoleucine and leucine were also detected in corn grains treated with BHA. Significant increases in fiber content were detected in inoculated corn grains treated with BHA, attaining 1. 34 to 2. 05 -fold over that of control, respectively. Treatment with FAT and BHA led to pronounced reductions in moisture content in corn inoculated with both F. verticilloides and A. flavus trials. However, treatment with ground clove significantly increase...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that hydrogen peroxide {{is an important}} mediator of ultraviolet B induced phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor in human keratinocytes. Here we demonstrate that physiologic doses of ultraviolet B and hydrogen peroxide stimulate activation of two related but distinct mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways: extracellular regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK 1 / 2), as well as p 38, the mammalian homolog of HOG 1 in yeast which is a major kinase for a recently identified stress-induced signaling pathway. The time-dependent activation of ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 are distinct, and ultraviolet B-induced ERK 1 / 2 activation is downregulated more rapidly than p 38. Using dihydrorhodamine or Amplex as specific fluorescent dye probes, we show that ultraviolet B-induced peroxides can be inhibited by ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid strongly blocks ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 activation by ultraviolet B and hydrogen peroxide whereas pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and <b>butyl</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> are less effective. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate was unable to inhibit ultraviolet B-induced p 38 activation. Cell death was increased after ultraviolet B when ERK 1 / 2 activation was attenuated by the specific inhibitor PD 098059. The distinct time courses and extents of activation and inhibition of ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 indicate that these pathways are separate and regulated independently in keratinocytes. Specific types of reactive oxygen species induced by ultraviolet B as well as selective activation or inhibition of specific phosphatases may mediate these responses in keratinocytes. These findings demonstrate that reactive oxygen species are important multifunctional mediators of ultraviolet B-induced ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 signaling transduction pathways and suggest that ERK 1 / 2 may play {{an important part in}} protecting keratinocytes from cell death following oxidative stress...|$|E
40|$|Induction of {{lipoxygenase}} (LOX) was {{studied in}} pearl millet seedlings upon inoculation with Sclerospora graminicola. Resistant pearl millet seedlings exhibited a 2. 4 -fold increase in LOX activity after inoculation with the downy mildew pathogen S. graminicola. This increase was mainly {{due to the}} synthesis of a new LOX isozyme designated as LOX- 6. Three of the six isozymes of lipoxygenase designated LOX- 1, - 3 and - 6, were purified from inoculated downy mildew resistant pearl millet seedlings as electrophoretically homogeneous proteins. The isozymes were purified stepwise by ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-sephadex A- 50 and sephadex G- 200 gel-filtration. Purification factor for LOX- 1, - 3 and - 6 were 46. 5, 73. 6 and 115. 7, respectively. The purified LOX- 1, - 3 and - 6 had molecular weight of 83, 77 and 73 kDa with a pI of 5. 5. 5. 8 and 6. 2, respectively. The {{results indicate that the}} LOX isozymes were dimers composed of two unequal subunits of 43 and 40 for LOX- 1. 40 and 37 for LOX- 3, 38 and 35 for LOX- 6. The optimum pH for LOX 6 was 6. 5 being stable from pH 4. 5 to 8. 0. The LOX- 1 and - 3 had a similar optimum pH of 9. 0. LOX isozymes had a different thermal stability ranging from 0 to 30 degreesC. Esculetin, NDGA, SHAM, N-propylgallate and copper sulfate were found to be the potent inhibitors of all three isozymes of LOX. All the isozymes of LOX revealed similar reaction with the metal ions like Ca 2 +, Ba 2 +, Mn 2 +, Cu 2 +, Fe 2 + and Mg 2 + with very few exceptions. <b>Butyl</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> caused the strongest inhibition of the pearl millet LOX isozymes among the various antioxidants tested. The LOX isozymes showed preferential activity towards linoleic acid followed by linolenic acid as substrate. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), in {{collaboration}} with the Dutch Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) Nutrition and Food Research Institute, is conducting studies to evaluate the role of chemical interactions in the expression of toxicity from low-level exposure to combinations of chemicals. The goal of this collaborative effort is to use a weight-of-evidence (WOE) approach to estimate joint toxicity of some simple chemical mixtures and to compare the estimations with test results from animal toxicity studies. The WOE approach uses individual chemical dose-response assessments and algorithms that incorporate various assumptions regarding potential chemical interactions. Qualitative evaluations were prepared for binary combinations of chemicals for the effect of <b>butyl</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> on di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, the effect of stannous chloride on Cd chloride (CdCl 2), and the effect of CdCl 2 on loperamide. Analyses of these evaluations and their comparison with the conclusions of laboratory animal experiments indicate that the WOE approach can be used to estimate qualitatively the joint toxicity of such simple mixtures. To further test the utility of the WOE approach, qualitative and semiquantitative evaluations were prepared for two chemical mixtures [...] one with similarly acting halogenated aliphatics (trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, hexachloro- 1, 3 -butadiene[HCBD], and 1, 1, 2 -trichloro- 3, 3, 3 -trifluoropropene [TCTFP]) and the other with dissimilarly acting nephrotoxic components (mercuric chloride, lysinolalanine, D-limonene, and HCBD). These two sets of data were used to estimate the overall toxicities of the mixtures using the WOE algorithm for the mixture. The comparison {{of the results of the}} estimated toxicity with experimentally determined toxicity of the mixture of similarly acting nephrotoxicants demonstrated that the WOE approach correctly adjusted for the observed interactions in experimental animal studies. However, this was not true for the mixture of dissimilarly acting nephrotoxicants. This could be attributed to the fact that WOE evaluations are based on dose additivity that postulates that all chemicals in a given mixture act in the same way [...] by the same mechanism [...] and differ only in their potencies. In these cases the WOE approach evaluations, based on consideration of common mechanisms for simple chemical mixtures, can lead to better estimates of joint toxicity of chemical mixtures than the default assumption of dose additivity. The results also show that the WOE evaluations should be target-organ specific because none of the models tested could approximate the observed responses in organs other than the target organs in the laboratory animal studies...|$|E
