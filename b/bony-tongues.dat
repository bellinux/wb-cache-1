It is a small 100 cm nektonic {{opportunistic}} carnivore in the family Osteoglossiformes which includes other <b>bony-tongues</b> such as the extant species of Arowana and Arapaima. It hunted small invertebrates and fish similarly to today's trout and became a Paleogene keystone species in many habitats before its disappearance from the fossil record.|$|E
40|$|An ancient genome {{duplication}} (TGD or 3 R) {{occurred in}} teleost fish after divergence from the lineage leading to gar. This genome duplication {{is shared by}} the three extant teleost lineages: Osteoglossomorpha (<b>bony-tongues),</b> Elopomorpha (eels and tarpons) and Clupeocephala (a large clade including salmon, carp, medaka, zebrafish, cichlids, pufferfish, stickleback and ~ 26, 000 other species). After TGD, different clupeocephalan species retained different gene duplicates; this is seen clearly in Hox gene clusters but extends to all genes. Since divergent resolution of TGD paralogs is a potential driving force for speciation, it is possible this contributed to diversification of this clade. The extent to which divergent resolution of TGD paralogs occurred within Osteoglossomorpha has not been investigated in detail, and Hox cluster organisation has been reported for just two species: Pantodon buchholzi (Pantodontidae) and Scleropages formosus (Osteoglossidae). We applied surveyscale genome sequencing and de novo assembly to three further osteoglossomorph taxa: Osteoglossum bicirrhosum (Osteoglossidae), Chitala ornata (Notopteridae), and Gnathonemus petersii (Mormyridae). We find that each retained more Hox genes than clupeocephalan taxa (excluding those that underwent additional genome duplication), but fewer than eels. Several Hox genes are missing in all teleosts, including duplicates of two Hox genes present in the slow evolving pre-TGD genome of the spotted gar. We find divergent resolution through individual gene losses and whole cluster losses has been rampant across osteoglossomorphs, despite their extant species paucity. We suggest that reciprocal gene loss following TGD were probably insufficient to drive the exceptional diversification of teleosts...|$|E
