40|$|This study uses new oil-spill models, bathymetric, meteorological, oceanographic, geomorphological and {{geological}} data {{to assess}} the impact of distinct oil spill scenarios on the southern coast of Cyprus, Eastern Mediterranean. This approach results from the urgent need to predict oil spill dispersion after new oil terminals and depots were built at Vasilikos, southern coast of Cyprus. The terminals have been able to receive tankers with ~ 500, 000 deadweight tonnes from November 2014. The new geomorphological and geological data in this work show the shoreline of Cyprus to be of high susceptibility due to: (a) the presence of a narrow continental shelf capable of trapping large quantities of hydrocarbons; (b) the existence of uplifted wave-cut platforms, coastal lagoons and pools forming natural traps for oil, and (c) the presence of important tourist and Natura 2000 sites. Under particular weather and oceanographic conditions, oil spills offshore Larnaca Bay will quickly spread and reach the shoreline ~ 46 h after the initial accident. Significantly, the models in this paper show a reduction from 84 % to 19 % in the volume of oil trapped on the coast if dispersants are applied, with the latter 19 % <b>being</b> potentially <b>kept</b> <b>at</b> <b>bay</b> using booms and mechanical removal techniques. Based on these results, we suggest the early use of dispersants, booms and mechanical removal procedures to prevent the spreading of oil spilt in the broad area of Larnaca Bay...|$|R

40|$|The LHC {{luminosity}} upgrade, {{known as}} the HL-LHC, will require high-speed optical links to read out data from the detectors. Such links must be capable of withstanding high doses whilst <b>being</b> <b>kept</b> <b>at</b> low temperatures. Two single-mode and two multi-mode fibres were exposed to 200 kGy(Si) at a dose rate of about 700 Gy(Si) /hr, whilst <b>being</b> <b>kept</b> <b>at</b> about - 25 °C. The radiation induced attenuation of these fibres was measured as the fibres accumulated dose. A conservative estimate {{has been made of}} the total attenuation expected for a realistic fibre route through the ATLAS detector after a lifetime dose at the HL-LHC. With safety factors, the maximum dose extrapolated to was 375 kGy(Si). All four fibres performed extremely well and were qualified for use at HL-LHC detectors. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA...|$|R
