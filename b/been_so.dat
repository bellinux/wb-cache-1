5|$|Because {{pterosaur}} anatomy has <b>been</b> <b>so</b> heavily modified for flight, {{and immediate}} transitional fossil predecessors have {{not so far}} been described, the ancestry of pterosaurs is not fully understood.

5|$|As {{that battle}} on the Somme dragged on, the Canadian Corps {{was brought up}} and the AIF was {{withdrawn}} from the line to re-organise and reform, having suffered almost 23,000 casualties {{over the course of}} the 45 days that they had been involved.

5|$|David Ignatius, a {{columnist}} for the Washington Post {{and the author of the}} book Body of Lies, opined that the CIA had become careless out of desperation.

Shoshana Bryen, a U.S. security expert, said that the bombing would make Israel and the U.S. wary in their future dealings with Jordan.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert brought suit, {{and after}} The Gondoliers closed in 1891, he withdrew the {{performance}} rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy.

Nevertheless, the partnership had <b>been</b> <b>so</b> profitable that, after the financial {{failure of the}} Royal English Opera House, Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer.|$|E
