25|$|One {{criticism}} already {{prevalent in}} the late 19th century, and still sometimes heard today, is that an international language might hasten the extinction of minority languages. One response has been that, even if this happens, the <b>benefits</b> <b>would</b> outweigh the costs; another, that proponents of auxlangs, particularly in the Esperanto movement, are generally also proponents of measures to conserve and promote minority languages and cultures.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{consider}} national defense, {{a standard}} {{example of a}} pure public good. Suppose homo economicus thinks about exerting some extra effort to defend the nation. The benefits to the individual of this effort would be very low, since the <b>benefits</b> <b>would</b> be distributed among all {{of the millions of}} other people in the country. There is also a very high possibility that he or she could get injured or killed during the course of his or her military service.|$|E

50|$|It {{has often}} been thought that the slash-burn plots are {{abandoned}} after {{one or two years}} because of un productive soil, but this is a common misconception. The Kayapớ revisit abandoned fields because plants can offer direct and indirect benefits. One direct <b>benefit</b> <b>would</b> be the ability to eat that which has been produced and an indirect <b>benefit</b> <b>would</b> be that open fields allow attract game for hunting and can produce long after they have been tended (Posey 2002).|$|R
25|$|Donald Trump, as Presidential candidate, {{proposed}} approximately $10 {{trillion in}} income tax cuts over a decade. Since those with higher income pay {{most of the}} income tax, the <b>benefits</b> <b>would</b> go disproportionately to them. On the other hand, Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton proposed raising taxes moderately on the top 5% of income earners; the top 1% would pay three-fourths of the tax increase. Her plan called for up to $500 billion in additional revenue over a decade. Both Trump and Clinton called for additional infrastructure investment.|$|E
25|$|By the 1950s, it {{appeared}} that absolute poverty was a minor problem although pockets did remain, for example among the elderly, but {{it was believed that}} increased welfare <b>benefits</b> <b>would</b> soon eradicate this lingering poverty. The conquest of poverty was put down to an expanding economy as the 1950s were the years of the 'affluent society', to government policies of full employment, and {{to the success of the}} welfare state. It was widely believed that the operation of the welfare state had redistributed wealth from rich to poor and significantly raised working class living standards.|$|E
25|$|The Council on Hemispheric Affairs (COHA) {{stated in}} a press release that under the Torrijos government, the {{expanding}} Panama Canal would not likely {{serve the needs of}} the vast majority of Panamanians. Many of the <b>benefits</b> <b>would</b> be tied to the commercial interests of the country's accountants, bankers, and lawyers, as well as their US counterparts, and world trade. They also said that the administration's rampant corruption and other flaws raised questions about Panama's capacity to supervise such an enormous project. COHA has received some letters pointing out factual errors in its statement, and plans to modify its statement in response.|$|E

25|$|On July 21, 2006, {{the writers}} of America's Next Top Model went on strike while working on cycle 7, set to premiere on the new CW Network in September 2006. The writers sought {{representation}} through the Writers Guild of America, West, which would allow them regulated wages, access to portable health insurance, and pension benefits. These <b>benefits</b> <b>would</b> be similar to those given to writers on scripted shows. The strike {{was the focus of}} a large rally of Hollywood writers coinciding with the premiere of the new network on September 20, 2006. The dispute was chronicled in a July 24 interview on the website Television Without Pity with Daniel J. Blau, a former recapper on the site who covered the series, and at the time was an America's Next Top Model show producer. In November 2006, the writers on strike were taken off payroll.|$|E
25|$|The {{passing of}} the Land Drainage Act 1930 held promise for the future. The many bodies {{responsible}} for small parts of Somerset's flood defences were swept away, and replaced by the Somerset Catchment Board. More importantly, perhaps, {{they did not have}} to prove that <b>benefits</b> <b>would</b> occur to a particular community in order to issue rates for drainage work, but could raise rates based on the rateable values of properties. This should have worked, but they soon became apprehensive, and reverted to producing reports, which were not actioned. However, inactivity gave way to action in 1939, when a new engineer was appointed, who saw it as his job to direct what needed to be done. Work began on improvements to the King's Sedgemoor Drain in 1939. The items to be addressed were the size of the channel, the size of the bridges, and the size of Dunball clyse, all of which were too small. The onset of the Second World War, just a few months later, threatened to stop the scheme, but did not.|$|E
25|$|About 1% of {{hospital}} admissions {{result in an}} adverse event due to negligence. However, mistakes are likely much more common, as these studies identify only mistakes that led to measurable adverse events occurring soon after the errors. Independent review of doctors' treatment plans suggests that decision-making could be improved in 14% of admissions; many of the <b>benefits</b> <b>would</b> have delayed manifestations. Even this number may be an underestimate. One study suggests that adults in the United States receive only 55% of recommended care. At the same time, a second study found that 30% of care in the United States may be unnecessary. For example, if a doctor fails to order a mammogram that is past due, this mistake will not {{show up in the}} first type of study. In addition, because no adverse event occurred during the short follow-up of the study, the mistake also would not show up in the second type of study because only the principal treatment plans were critiqued. However, the mistake would be recorded in the third type of study. If a doctor recommends an unnecessary treatment or test, it may not show in any of these types of studies.|$|E

25|$|The 19th century, conservative, post-Revolution France was inhospitable for feminist ideas, as {{expressed}} in the counter-revolutionary writings {{on the role of}} women by Joseph de Maistre and Viscount Louis de Bonald. Advancement came mid-century under the 1848 revolution and the proclamation of the Second Republic, which introduced male suffrage amid hopes that similar <b>benefits</b> <b>would</b> apply to women. Although the Utopian Charles Fourier is considered a feminist writer of this period, his influence was minimal at the time. With the fall of the conservative Louis-Philippe in 1848, feminist hopes were raised, as in 1790. Movement newspapers and organizations appeared, such as Eugénie Niboyet's La Voix des Femmes (The Women's Voice), the first feminist daily newspaper in France. Niboyet was a Protestant who had adopted Saint-Simonianism, and La Voix attracted other women from that movement, including the seamstress Jeanne Deroin and the primary schoolteacher Pauline Roland. Unsuccessful attempts were also made to recruit George Sand. Feminism was treated as a threat due to its ties with socialism, which was scrutinized since the Revolution. Deroin and Roland were both arrested, tried, and imprisoned in 1849. With the emergence of a new, more conservative government in 1852, feminism would {{have to wait until the}} Third French Republic.|$|E
25|$|In 1953 the NCAA {{changed the}} game by {{canceling}} a rule that was in place since World War II, a team could no longer make multiple substitutions and have specific players for each position, only one substitution could be made per play. Up to this change Pappy's approach was to use highly specialized players for key positions, which no longer became possible after the change. With the rule was withdrawn Cal went from 7–3 to 4–4–2. The 1953 season is partially associated with a recruiting scandal involving star freshman quarterback Ronnie Knox. In order to have Knox enroll at the university, the California football booster club promised him that Knox's step father to be hired as a scout, his high school coach would be hired as an assistant coach, and that Knox himself would be given a job writing for a local newspaper and also be paid $500 per year by the booster club. Knox enrolled at Cal but California's administration found out and made sure that the <b>benefits</b> <b>would</b> not be provided. Following investigation by both administration and the PCC conference, {{it was found that}} Waldorf was not directly involved in the scandal. The team did not have a winning season after 1953 and Pappy retired {{at the end of the}} 1956 season when Cal went 3–7. During the late 50's NCAA kept changing its rules and by 1964 it again allowed unlimited substitutions.|$|E

500|$|Opposition to {{construction}} of the pipeline primarily came from two sources: [...] Alaska Native groups and conservationists.

500|$|Wilkinson {{had left}} the march at Chester-le-Street to attend the Labour Party's annual conference, taking place in Edinburgh.

The Labour conference's negative stance brought angry responses from the marchers; Riley considered {{that they had been}} [...] "stabbed in the back".

25|$|A Green Paper {{published}} in 1998 foreshadowed New Labour's approach to out-of-work benefit reform {{from that point}} on: being in work was vital and the government would encourage people on benefits to find jobs, using the carrot and the stick; the claimant's contribution would be {{to try to find}} work; and Incapacity <b>Benefit</b> <b>would</b> be partially means-tested, with people receiving an occupational pension incurring a deduction in the amount of Incapacity <b>Benefit</b> they <b>would</b> receive.|$|R
500|$|If any {{method is}} ever successful, {{there is the}} {{suggestion}} to introduce the hybrids to a wildlife reserve in Siberia called the Pleistocene Park. Some biologists question the ethics of such recreation attempts. In addition to the technical problems, {{there is not much}} habitat left that would be suitable for elephant-mammoth hybrids. Because both species are [...] social and gregarious, creating a few specimens would not be ideal. The time and resources required would be enormous, and the scientific <b>benefits</b> <b>would</b> be unclear, suggesting these resources should instead be used to preserve extant elephant species which are endangered. The ethics of using elephants as surrogate mothers in hybridization attempts has also been questioned, as most embryos would not survive, and {{it would be impossible to}} know the exact needs of a hybrid elephant-mammoth calf.|$|E
500|$|Social Security <b>benefits</b> <b>would</b> be {{adjusted}} for any price changes due to FairTax implementation. [...] The Beacon Hill Institute {{states that it}} would not matter, apart from transition issues, whether prices fall or rise—the relative tax burden and tax rate remains the same. [...] Decreases in production cost would not fully apply to imported products; so according to proponents, it would provide tax advantages for domestic production and increase U.S. competitiveness in global trade (see Border adjustability). [...] To ease the transition, U.S. retailers will receive a tax credit equal to the FairTax on their inventory to allow for quick cost reduction. Retailers would also receive an administrative fee equal to the greater of $200 or 0.25% of the remitted tax as compensation for compliance costs, which amounts to around $5 billion.|$|E
500|$|Baker ran as {{a social}} liberal (in favor of gay {{marriage}} and abortion rights) but a fiscal conservative, stressing job creation as his primary focus. His campaign centered on [...] "Baker's Dozen", a plan outlining 13 areas of state government reform. Baker's campaign said that his plan, which included consolidation of government, welfare reform, and restructuring of public employee pension and retirement <b>benefits,</b> <b>would</b> lower state expenditures by over $1 billion. Baker, {{a former member of}} the Massachusetts Board of Education, advocated increasing the number of charter, magnet, and alternative schools. Believing that education is a [...] "civil right", he also aimed to close the educational achievement gap among underprivileged and minority students. At a town hall meeting in Chilmark, Massachusetts, on the island of Martha's Vineyard, Baker voiced his opposition to the proposed Cape Wind project supported by Governor Deval Patrick.|$|E
