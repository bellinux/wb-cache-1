The system is composed of a laser triangulation measurement system and a computer which analyses the measured <b>belt</b> <b>profiles,</b> determines the characteristic dimensions of the belt and classifies the belts according to their adherence to the prescribed manufacturing tolerances. The contribution presents the main features of the method for automated geometry assessment. In {{the first step of}} the assessment a theoretical profile composed of geometrical primitives (lines, arcs) and defined by the manufacturing documentation is fitted to a measured profile. The contribution presents an experimental evaluation of three different fitting methods. Sample belts of two different types are used in this evaluation. About 200 <b>belt</b> <b>profiles</b> have been measured, most of them in the parts with surface defects. The corresponding theoretical profiles are fitted to the measured profiles using three fitting methods. The parameters of the geometric primitives are determined by the fit and used to calculate the dimensions of the profiles.

40|$|The {{energy loss}} due to {{indentation}} rolling resistance in {{a conveyor belt}} system can account for up to 60 % of the total power usage. It arises due to an asymmetric pressure distribution as a viscoelastic belt cover is indented by a rigid idler roll. This causes a retarding moment on the idler roll, dependent on the load, speed, idler diameter and {{the properties of the}} conveyor belt cover. As pouch conveyor systems become more prevalent in industry, the supporting structure, and thus the indentation rolling resistance of such systems is of importance. These designs typically employ curved <b>belt</b> <b>profiles,</b> or spherical idlers in order to aid belt tracking and closing. From this, a spherical indentation into a generalised Maxwell backing is modelled, and compared with experimental values.

Radiation <b>belt</b> <b>profiles</b> determined by the trapped radiation detectors on Pioneer 10 and 11 indicate that Saturn's magnetosphere is intermediate in size between those {{of the earth and}} Jupiter, with particle intensities {{similar to those of the}} earth. The outer region of the Saturn magnetosphere is found to contain particles of lower energy than the outer region, being strongly influenced by the time-varying solar wind. The moons and rings of Saturn are observed to be effective absorbers of trapped particles, confirming the discoveries of the F ring, the Pioneer ring division and the moon 1979 S 2. Particle diffusion rates are used to estimate a cross-sectional area of greater than 7 x 10 to the 13 th sq cm and an opacity greater than 0. 00001 for the F ring.

40|$|An {{automotive}} {{synchronous belt}} transmits power and assures accurate timing between the crankshaft and camshafts. The automotive industry is very competitive: there is constant pressure to increase performance and lower costs. For synchronous belts, {{this means that}} replacement intervals must be longer {{at the same time}} as the loading situation becomes more complex due to engine development. Hence, it has become important to be able to predict belt life in early design stages. This thesis covers the fundamentals of belt life predictions, namely, synchronous belt mechanics. A quasi-static load distribution model, which includes spring stiffnesses determined by a finite element based method, is presented. Since loads in an automotive synchronous belt drive are not quasi-static, a dynamic load distribution model was developed. These two models have a unique force decomposition that includes a radial degree of freedom for each pitch. It is shown that dynamic models must be used for <b>belt</b> <b>profiles</b> where friction forces take part in the power transmission {{at the same time as}} rapid load changes are present. This is due to the friction history dependency. Load distribution measurements were made under contrasting conditions: quasi-static in a simple two pulley rig and dynamic in a running engine. These measurements were made possible by a strain gauge equipped measurement pulley able to measure four of the force components calculated by the models mentioned above. The models show good agreement with experiments. The pitch difference was shown to be crucial to the load distribution; this finding could be used to optimize a belt-pulley interaction. The finding is also valid under both quasi-static and dynamic conditions. During the experiments, wear-induced geometric changes that led to a redistribution of friction forces were observed. Descriptions of the three failure modes exhibited by automotive cambelts under normal operation are found in the thesis. For one of these failure modes, land area wear, a method to measure wear is devised. The method uses well-know roughness parameters derived from surface topology measurements. An investigation made on belts from test engines, points to effects from at least two land area wear types. The first is caused by the relative motion between belt and pulley during complete mesh; the second arises from counter-directional friction forces at seating and unseating. It is also shown that there exits an optimum pitch difference (in terms of wear durability); and that this optimum is shifted by a decrease in the extensional belt stiffness. The results and models presented can be used in the design of improved synchronous belt transmissions...|$|R

In the past four decades, steel shear walls are utilized in huge constructions in some seismic countries such as Japan, United States, and Canada to lessen the risk of destructive forces. The steel shear walls are divided into two types: unstiffened and stiffened. In the former, a series of plates (sinusoidal and trapezoidal corrugated) with light thickness are used that have the postbuckling field property under overall buckling. In the latter, steel <b>profile</b> <b>belt</b> series are employed as stiffeners with different arrangement: horizontal, vertical, or diagonal in one side or both sides of wall. In the unstiffened walls, increasing the thickness causes {{an increase in the}} wall capacity under large forces in tall structures. In the stiffened walls, joining the stiffeners to the wall is costly and time consuming. The ANSYS software was used to analyze the different models of unstiffened one-story steel walls with sinusoidal and trapezoidal corrugated plates under lateral load. The obtained results demonstrated that, in the walls with the same dimensions, the trapezoidal corrugated plates showed higher ductility and ultimate bearing compared to the sinusoidal corrugated plates...|$|R

This {{is the case}} of the fault system bounding the Vallo di Diano, the largest intermountain basin in the southern Apennines seismic <b>belt.</b> Industry reflection <b>profiles</b> define the large-scale structure of the basin but barely image the shallow fault system due to unfavorable topographic and near-surface conditions along the foothills of the eastern range. We present two high-resolution wide-aperture profiles recorded at the eastern margin of the basin across unreported scarps that affect Middle–Late Pleistocene alluvial fans and slope debris. The survey is aimed at iden- tifying possible recent faulting across these challenging terrains and at understanding the relationship between shallow structures and the master range-bounding fault at depth. Common depth point processing of wide-aperture reflection data and first- arrival travel-time tomography provide detailed images of the upper 200 – 300 m and sounding evidence of recent activity along previously unknown splays of the fault system. These splays dissect the Mesozoic limestone bedrock and alluvial-fan sequences, affecting their depositional pattern. Very high resolution V P and reflec- tivity images also give hints of possible coseismic surface faulting in Holocene colluvia. These results have relevant implications for the evaluation of the seismogenic potential of the range-bounding fault system and for seismic hazard assessment of the densely urbanized Vallo di Diano basin...|$|R

The <b>belts</b> consisted of <b>profiled</b> buckle with tile and two kinds of applications: application in the shape of "double lilies" ("anchor") and heart-shaped as well as a pendant and tab. The metal parts of the belts were of silver gilt, while the textile band was made of red silk. On the basis of numerous similar findings from nearly whole Europe the production of the belts with "double lilies" was determinate to 13 th с. It was suggested that these belts used to have a long lasting life. They were given as very valuable presents and later inherited by father to son. According to the author at the beginning the belts were imported to Varna by merchants of Venice, where their attendance was proven by written records. Later on after the model of the expensive imported belts a production of similar belts began in Varna. Good evidence for that local production is two moulds for casting of belt-buckles and a semi-manufactured application. It is to be underlined that this kind of belts was only male accessory.

40|$|Superposed-epoch {{analysis}} is performed on magnetic field measurements from five GOES spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit during 63 high-speed stream-driven storms in 1995 – 2005. The field {{strength and the}} field stretching angle are examined as functions of time and local time, and these quantities are compared with {{the properties of the}} solar wind, the plasma sheet, and the outer electron radiation belt. Compression of the dayside magnetosphere coincides with an increased solar wind ram pressure commencing before the arrival of the corotating interaction region (CIR). Stretching of the nightside magnetosphere occurs in two phases: a strong-stretching phase early in the storm followed by a modest-stretching phase lasting for days. The strong-stretching phase coincides with the occurrence of the superdense plasma sheet, implying that ion pressure causes the strong stretching. This nightside strong-stretching perturbation corresponds to a ∼ 25 % contribution to Dst*. The relativistic electron flux at geosynchronous orbit has a dropout recovery temporal profile that matches the strong-stretching temporal profile; however, the number density dropout and recovery of the electron radiation <b>belt</b> has a <b>profile</b> that leads the stretching profile. A comparison of geosynchronous field strengths and magnetopause field strengths indicates that magnetopause shadowing plays a role in the radiation belt dropout. Temporal fluctuations of the geosynchronous magnetic field are examined via 1 min changes of the GOES magnetic field vectors. Fluctuation amplitudes increase at all local times at storm onset and then slowly decay during the storms. The amplitude is linearly related to the Kp, PCI, and MBI indices, except during the strong-stretching phase of the storms...|$|R

Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the largest component of the terrestrial carbon pooland plays {{a vital role in}} the terrestrial carbon cycle. However, it remains a challenge to accurately quantify SOC stocks and evolution at regional scale. The general objective of the research is to improve the regional SOC inventories and scenarios by taking into account the lateral fluxes of sediments and carbon. The study focuses on the cultivated areas of the Belgian loam belt. The first part of the project consists in constructing a 3 -dimensional SOC map of a study area inside the loam <b>belt,</b> from soil <b>profile</b> description and ancillary environmental data. The digital soil database Aardewerk provided georeferenced soil profile description across all the Belgian loam belt. A Monte Carlo method was used to account for the uncertainty in the horizons boundaries. Different methods permitting to construct continuous distribution of SOC density from bulk horizon measurements were compared. Colluvial properties were searched in the profile description database that best characterized the erosion-accumulation pattern of the region. Different topographic indices were computed from digital elevation models to assess the influence of the topography on the SOC distribution. A linear regression analysis was conducted in order to predict the SOC spatial distribution at different depth intervals from soil and terrain properties. Using the resulting model, maps of SOC and other soil properties at differents depths, and representative of the situation in ~ 1960, will be constructed.

40|$|The Dawn mission showed {{asteroid}} 4 Vesta {{to be an}} extensively cratered body, ancient in age, with craters in {{a variety}} of morphologies and preservation states [1 - 3]. Tying Vesta's relative crater ages to an absolute impact history can be accomplished through investigations of the HED (howardite, eucrite, diogenite) meteorites. Eucrites are crustal basalts and gabbros, diogenites are mostly orthopyroxenites representing lower crust or upper mantle materials, and howardites are mixed breccias containing both lithologies. Eucrite 53 Mn- 53 Cr systematics show that the HED parent body globally differentiated by ~ 4. 56 Ga and fully crystallized soon afterwards [4]. Much later, many eucrites were brecciated and heated by large impacts into the parent body surface. Disturbance ages in eucrites show that multiple large impacts occurred within 1 Gyr after crystallization, showing a history that largely resembles that of the Moon [5 - 7]. Dawn images also showed that Vesta is covered with a well-developed regolith that is spectrally similar to howardite meteorites [8]. Howardites are polymict regolith breccias made up mostly of clasts of eucrites and diogenites, but which also contain clasts formed by melting of the regolith by relatively large, energetic impact events. Impact-melt clast ages from howardites extend our knowledge of the impact history of Vesta, expanding on eucrite disturbance ages and helping give absolute age context to the observed crater-counts produced using Dawn data. The distribution of 40 Ar- 39 Ar ages of impact-melt clasts in howardites shows that they formed within the time period 3. 3 - 3. 8 Ga [9]. These, and other impact-melted HED materials, have distinct age and compositional characteristics that suggest they formed in discrete impact events. In order to create these crystalline impact-melt products on the surface of Vesta, the impacts during this time period must have had velocities much higher than 5 km/s, the main belt average [10]. This is inconsistent with formation by a normal distribution of impact velocities and points instead to a unique period where high-velocity collisions were more frequent than currently observed. Until now, impact-reset ages in the HED meteorites have been be interpreted under the umbrella of the canonical lunar cataclysm where an increase in the absolute number of bombarding objects is responsible for creating larger absolute amounts of impact-affected and impact-melted rocks, statistically increasing their chances of being found on Earth and dated. However, the distribution of age among the howardite impact-melt clasts may not necessarily result from an increased number of impacts, but rather result from impacts of higher velocity. The changeover from a typical main <b>belt</b> velocity <b>profile</b> to this regime of increased velocity population at Vesta occurs contemporaneously with a similar transition at the Moon, indicating that howardite impact-melt clast ages reinforce the notion of a dynamically unusual episode of bombardment in the inner solar system beginning at around 4. 0 Ga...|$|R

New settlers in many areas produced relatively little until the federal government built a major irrigation system through the reclamation program; other farmers depended on underground water to sustain their crops.;Central players {{in the development of the}} western cotton industry were the researchers and scientists of the U.

40|$|We present depth {{profiles}} of Cd isotopes and concentrations from the Southern Ocean at four {{stations in the}} Atlantic sector along the Greenwich Meridian (47 °S to 68 °S) located across the main Antarctic frontal zones and productivity <b>belt.</b> The vertical <b>profiles</b> of Cd concentration typically show low values in surface waters, elevated values at intermediate depths, reflecting remineralization of sinking particulate organic matter, and constant values in deep waters. The surface-to-deep isotopic gradient shows “heavy” Cd isotope signatures in the mixed surface layer, becoming more pronounced northward, with values up to ɛ 112 / 110 Cd of around + 4. 1 in the Subantarctic sector of the Southern Ocean. Deep Antarctic waters display a uniform and “light” ɛ 112 / 110 Cd of + 1. 18 ± 0. 38 and Cd concentrations of 0. 761 ± 0. 101 nmol/kg (n = 23, 2 SD). Intermediate waters are characterized by ɛ 112 / 110 Cd lying between those of surface and deep waters, with a constant value of about + 0. 8 in the High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll sector and a notably higher value of + 2. 3 in the Subantarctic sector. The Cd isotope fractionation in the Southern Ocean closely follows a simple closed-system Rayleigh model, in which biological uptake of Cd imparts the ɛ 112 / 110 Cd signature to the surface layer while that of deep waters {{is determined by the}} flux of regenerated isotopically-light Cd from sinking organic matter from the surface ocean and the degree of mixing of distinct water masses. The vertical gradient documented for Cd isotopes and nutrient ratios, along with the meridional gradient in surface waters, highlights the important role played by upwelling in the Southern Ocean in closing the meridional overturning circulation via the export of Antarctic intermediate and mode waters which have a distinctive chemical (low Cd:P) and Cd isotope (“heavy”) signature. The combined Cd–Zn isotope systematics provide evidence for a strong link between the magnitude of biological Cd stable isotope fractionation and Zn availability in the contrasted nutrient and ecological regimes of the Southern Ocean. Substitution of Cd for Zn in the enzyme carbonic anhydrase appears to be the driving mechanism for Cd isotope fractionation in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, while an “excess-uptake” mechanism seems to predominate in the Weddell Gyre. Our study highlights some of the complexities of the biogeochemical cycling of Cd in the oceans. Nevertheless, systematic variations in Cd isotopic compositions with water mass distribution in the Southern Ocean suggest that Cd isotopes could, with some caveats, be useful tracers of changes in past nutrient utilization and deep water circulation. ...|$|R
40|$|Several seismic {{reflection}} {{surveys were}} conducted in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s {{under the auspices of}} the SA National Geophysics Programme. These surveys targeted the Bushveld Complex, Limpopo Mobile Belt (Limpopo Province), Witwatersrand Basin, Vredefort Dome and the Beattie magnetic anomaly (BMA) in the Southern Karoo. The 100 km seismic reflection profile described in this study (SAGS- 03 - 92) covers the BMA, the Southern Cape Conductive Belt (SCCB) and the Karoo/Cape Fold <b>Belt</b> boundary. The <b>profile</b> runs from approximately Droëkloof in the south to Beaufort West in the north along the N 12 national road. The profile was acquired in 1992, but the complete profile was not interpreted or published prior to this study. The purpose of this study is to successfully reprocess the data and to do a structural and stratigraphic interpretation in order to try and understand the geological history and processes that led up to the formation of the rocks in that area. SAGS- 03 - 92 reveals a clear image of the crust in the southern Karoo. The crust is interpreted to be around 37 km thick in the area of investigation and can be classed into three parts: upper crust, middle crust and lower crust. The upper crust consists of the Karoo and Cape Supergroup rocks that dip slightly to the south. This interpretation has been confirmed by two deep boreholes (BH No. 3 and KW 1 / 67). The seismic fabric shows quite a strong character in the upper crust and the interpreted boundaries between the different lithologies (The Table Mountain, Bokkeveld and Witteberg Groups of the Cape Supergroup and the Dwyka, Ecca and Beaufort Groups of the Karoo Supergroup) are for the most part quite easy to identify. Within the Cape Fold Belt (CFB), however, the seismic character becomes distorted in such a way that it is very difficult to make out any features. This is possibly due to the severe faulting and folding that occurred when the CFB formed. An unconformity that can continually be followed throughout the profile (although it disappears in the south of the profile possibly due to deformation when the CFB formed) separates the upper crust from the middle crust and the unconformity is clearly indicated by a strong series of reflectors on the seismic profile. The middle crust is interpreted to consist of granitic-gneisses belonging to the Bushmanland Terrane (part of the Namaqua-Natal Belt (NNB)). The seismic profile suggests that the NNB gneisses continue beneath the Cape Fold Belt. The seismic fabric dips steeply to the north. The middle crust also hosts the source of the Beattie Magnetic Anomaly (BMA). There is an area of high reflectivity under the BMA on the seismic profile that differs significantly from the surrounding seismic character. This area is characterised by a beanshaped cluster of strong reflections dipping north and south. It is 10 km wide, with a thickness of 8 km and occurs at a depth of 6 km to 10 km. The lower crust is interpreted to consist of either granites belonging to the Areachap Terrane, Richtersveld or Kheis Province (NNB) or rocks belonging to the Kheis Province. The seismic fabric of the lower crust dips moderately to the south. The Moho is recognised at 37 km depth at 68 km from the south of the profile, but for the rest of the profile, it is unclear where the Moho is encountered. The research done for this study correlates well with work done under the auspices of Inkaba yeAfrica, especially the work done by Ansa Lindequ...|$|R

This thesis presents new magnetic and gravity data for the Southern New England Fold Belt (SNEFB) and the Gunnedah Basin that adjoins to the west along the Mooki Fault in New South Wales. The SNEFB consists of the Tamworth Belt and Tablelands Complex that are separated by the Peel Fault. The Tablelands Complex {{to the east of}} the Peel Fault represents an accretionary wedge, and the Tamworth Belt to the west corresponds to the forearc basin. A total of five east-north-east trending gravity profiles with around 450 readings were conducted across the Tamworth Belt and Gunnedah Basin. Seven ground magnetic traverses of a total length of 60 km were surveyed across the bounding faults of the Tamworth belt, of which five were across the Peel Fault and two were across the Mooki Fault. The gravity data shows two distinct large positive anomalies, one over the Tamworth Belt, known as the Namoi Gravity High and another within the Gunnedah Basin, known as the Meandarra Gravity Ridge. All gravity profiles show similarity to each other. The magnetic data displays one distinct anomaly associated with the Peel Fault and an anomaly immediately east of the Mooki Fault. These new potential field data are used to better constrain the orientation of the Peel and Mooki Faults as well as the subsurface geometry of the Tamworth Belt and Gunnedah Basin, integrating with the published seismic data, geologic observations and new physical properties data. [...] Magnetic anomalies produced by the serpentinite associated with the Peel Fault were used to determine the orientation of the Peel fault. Five ground magnetic traverses were modelled to get the subsurface geometry of the serpentinite body. Modelling results of the magnetic anomalies across the Peel Fault indicate that the serpentinite body can be mostly modelled as subvertical to steeply eastward dipping tabular bodies with a minimum depth extent of 1 - 3 km, although the modelling does not constrain the vertical extent. This is consistent with the modelling of the magnetic traverses extracted from aeromagnetic data. Sensitivity analysis of a tabular magnetic body reveals that a minimum susceptibility of 4000 x 10 ⁻⁶cgs is needed to generate the observed high amplitude anomalies of around 2000 nT, which is consistent with the susceptibility measurements of serpentinite samples along the Peel Fault ranging from 2000 to 9000 x 10 ⁻⁶ cgs. Rock magnetic study indicates that the serpentinite retains a strong remanence at some locations. This remanence is a viscous remanent magnetisation (VRM) which is parallel to the present Earth's magnetic field, and explains the large anomaly amplitude over the Peel fault at these locations. The remanence of serpentinite at other localities is not consistent enough to contribute to the observed magnetic anomalies. A much greater depth extent of the Peel Fault was inferred from gravity models. It is proposed that the serpentinite along the Peel Fault was emplaced as a slice of oceanic floor that has been accreted {{to the front of the}} arc, or as diapirs rising off the serpentinised part of the mantle wedge above the supra subduction zone. Magnetic anomalies immediately east of the Mooki Fault once suggested to be produced by a dyke-like body emplaced along the fault were modelled along two ground magnetic traverses and three extracted aeromagnetic lines. Modelling results indicate that the anomalies can be modelled as an east-dipping overturned western limb of an anticline formed as a result of a fault-propagation fold with a shallow thrust step-up angle from the décollement. Interpretation of aeromagnetic data and modelling of the magnetic traverses indicate that the anomalies along the Mooki Fault are produced by the susceptibility contrast between the high magnetic Late Carboniferous Currabubula Formation and/or Early Permian volcanic rocks of the Tamworth Belt and the less magnetic Late Permian-Triassic Sydney-Gunnedah Basin rocks. Gravity modelling indicates that the Mooki Fault has a shallow dip (̃ 25 °) to the east. Modelling of the five gravity profiles shows that the Tamworth Belt is thrust westward over the Sydney-Gunnedah Basin for 15 - 30 km. [...] The Meandarra Gravity Ridge within the Gunnedah Basin was modelled as a high density volcanic rock unit with a density contrast of 0. 25 tm⁻³, compared to the rocks of the Lachlan Fold <b>Belt</b> in all <b>profiles.</b> The volcanic rock unit has a steep western margin and a gently dipping eastern margin with a thickness ranging from 4. 5 - 6 km, and has been generally agreed to have formed within an extensional basin. [...] The Tamworth Belt, being mainly the product of volcanism of mafic character and thus has high density units, together with the high density Woolomin Association, which is composed chiefly of chert/jasper, basalt, dolerite and metabasalt, produces the Namoi Gravity High. Gravity modelling results indicate that the anomaly over the Tamworth Belt can be modelled as either a configuration where the Tablelands Complex extends westward underthrusting the Tamworth Belt, or a configuration where the Tablelands Complex has been thrust over the Tamworth Belt. When the gravity profiles were modelled with the first configuration, the Peel Fault with a depth extent of around 1 km can only be modelled for the Manilla and Quirindi profiles, modelling of the rest of the gravity profiles indicates that the Tablelands Complex underthrust beneath the Tamworth belt at a much deeper location.

It appeared that in the dry season(s) saturation deficit in the open could rise to considerable heights (figs. 23 - 25, 28, 32, 33); during the 8 wettest months it seldom reached a value of 12 mm (rel. hum. 60 %) for longer than ¼ hr. /day, but during the 2 driest months the deficit generally rose above 12 mm (rel. hum. below 40 %) during at least 1 hr. /day, and values above 20 mm (rel. hum. 45 %) were recorded repeatedly during more than one hour on end. During a very dry season a deficit of 22 mm (rel. hum. 42 %) is reached nearly every day for at least 2 hours, thus approaching values similar to those reported in desert regions. Yet, even during the driest periods {{there is a long}} night period of high humidity (fig. 28). Although the atmospheric humidity of the rain forest in Suriname showed a lower average and reached considerably lower minima than e. g. in Africa, it is uncertain whether these differences are real, because the records from other forests probably did not show the full seasonal range of humidity (1. 4. 5). During the present study extensive use was made of a set of Piche evaporimeters, although we were fully aware of the limited value of data which are obtained with an instrument that by its nature can never fully integrate the effect of various stimuli to water loss in exactly the same manner in which this is done by plants. Yet the use of a mechanical device that measures the integrated effect of the various factors by which transpiration is promoted may provide data of great ecological value, notably for comparative purposes. The advantages and limitations of the values obtained with Piche evaporimeters were discussed in 1. 5. 1 and 1. 5. 2. It appeared that the readings of capillary evaporation, especially when averaged over longer periods, may provide a very convenient measure of the relative differences in atmospheric humidity in various habitats (figs. 30, 31, 34, 45). In the forest the seasonal differences in air temperature appeared to be rather small (fig. 31), owing to the small range of the seasonal variations in overall air temperature. The daily maximum in the undergrowth of mesophytic forest generally varied between 25 ° and 30 ° C, and the minima between 20 ° and 22 ° C. The data on air temperature have been summarized in table V, and are shown graphically in figs. 31, 37 - 40. The soil temperature under forest cover showed only very small seasonal and daily variations, and at a depth of 2 cm presumably never exceeds a value of 28 ° C. The data have been summarized in table V and are shown graphically in figs. 41 - 44. The maximum range of temperature observed at 75 cm depth under closed forest remained below 2 °. It may safely be assumed that a single reading at this depth may serve as a close approximation of the long-term average of air temperature in the undergrowth. Although being small, the differences in soil temperature under different types of vegetation appeared to provide a useful, integrating index of environmental factors, as illustrated in fig. 45. In a large clearing, where the bare soil is insolated throughout the day, down to a depth of 75 cm the average temperature is considerably more than 25 ° C, which is the critical value above which destruction of organic matter in the soil is assumed to proceed at a higher rate than its deposition. In savanna forest (xeromorphous forest) intensity of illumination, air temperature, evaporation, saturation deficit and soil temperature were on the average higher than in mesophytic (rain) forest, and showed somewhat greater daily and seasonal amplitudes. During the greater part of the year the differences were very small, but they became larger during the dry season (figs. 22, 27, 31, 36, 37, 39, 44, 45). The second part deals with the soils of the regions where our ecological studies were carried out. Two main geomorphological units are recognizable in this area (II. 2. 1, II. 3) : (1) the Old cristalline Basement which is of Pre-cambrian age and which in the area under consideration consists mainly of acidic, highly metamorphous rocks with igneous intrusions; (2) the Zanderij formation which forms the nearly flat “cover landscape” between the Basement and the Coastal Sediment series. The soil studies were chiefly carried out in the transitional zone between the two formation(-series) : Mapane- and Upper-Coesewijne-region, and were described in sections II. 2 and II. 3 (cf. figs. 1 - 3, 46, 48, 53, 54). In this region the surface of the Basement Complex, which is the remnant of a very old peneplain, is undulating to fairly flat, dissected by numerous creeks and gullies; the soils vary from sandy clays to loamy coarse sands, and for the greater part are covered with (sub-) mesophytic lowland forest. Farther inland, ferrallitic soils — with abundant pisolithic ironstone gravel in the upper horizons — may predominate (II. 4) and, locally on plateaus, very shallow soils may cover a sheet of lateritic ironstone (ferrite/ferrobauxite); the forest (III. 4) is sub-mesophytic or (sub-) xeromorphous hillforest. The “Zanderij sands” which form the oldest non-consolidated sediments, vary from bleached coarse sands (with open savanna/savanna forest) to red sandy clay-loams (with sub-mesophytic forest). Although it was not our intention to develop a classification of the forest soils found in the lowlands of central Suriname, behind the coastal <b>belt,</b> the soil <b>profiles</b> were divided into 4 groups, depending on the degree of drainage, viz.; impeded, partially impeded, free, or excessive; the ferrallitic soils were kept apart. The distribution of the main types of vegetation on the nutritionally poor soils behind the coastal belt (figs. 46 and 53), presumably is mainly controlled by physical features on which the moisture relations in the soil depend; mesophytic forest is found on mesic sites, viz. on well-aerated soils where water-supply is sufficient throughout the greater part of the year. The results of the laboratory analyses (tables VI-XI) show {{that the majority of the}} soils in the sites studied, though varying in some of their characteristics (structure, texture, topography, parent materials) share many qualities which may be regarded as being typical for the majority of the soils of the rain-forest belt: in texture they are loamy to clayey, but invariably sandy, especially in the upper horizons; they are invariably acid, and are highly deficient in exchangeable bases (particularly in calcium and phosphorus), the kaolinitic clay-kolloid being strongly degraded; their organic-matter content is rather low, and the narrow C/N ratio — which is noted even in the upper horizons — indicates that humification is nearly complete and must take place very rapidly. The soils are practically devoid of weatherable minerals. The parent rock is weathered down to considerable depth and practically is split up in quartz (gravel, sand, silt), kaolin and iron (in the ferro-form in the soil solution and as ferri in coatings on the quartz grains and occasionally in the form of iron concretions). The base exchange capacity of kaolinite being very low, the humus colloids form the only adsorption complex of any importance. In the Mapane area the soil was sampled systematically in a 50 -ha complex with the principal object to ascertain how much the soil varied over a small area, and to what extend variations in soil factors might account for the striking irregularities of the distributional pattern of the trees. As a matter of fact individuals of many species in stands of mesophytic forest show a non-random distribution (II. 2. 3, IV. 5, figs. 47, 50, 52, 69); for the majority of the species studied no correlation could be found between their distribution and definite soil properties (II. 2. 3). Only for two species such a correlation could be ascertained (II. 2. 3, figs. 50, 52). The peculiar distribution of Vouacapoua americana (fig. 46) was discussed in detail in II. 2. 3. By means of distributional maps for two important tree species in small areas in the Upper-Coesewijne region (figs. 55 - 57) the very wide ecological amplitude of many tree species of the mesophytic forest is demonstrated. Combined data on pore space and soil moisture, being of paramount ecological interest, were determined (by means of constant-volume rings) at different depths of the soil profile for a range of soil types. Methods and results are discussed in section II. 6. The porosity figures given in table XII show that the total pore volume in the upper horizons of soils under forest cover is within wide limits independent of the mechanical composition of the soil, and varies between 39 - 47 % in the main zone of biological activity in the profile. As might have been expected, soil moisture appeared to he strongly correlated with the mechanical composition of the soil (fig. 59, tables XII-XIV). It was made plausible that the occurrence of mottling in the soil profile is connected with an interference in aeration during at least part of the year. The third part deals with a number of botanical surveys carried out in various types of mesophytic forest. Here too it was not the intention to arrive at a sociological classification, but we merely wished to obtain an impression of the order of magnitude of the differences found in these types of forest. To this end sample plots of 0. 3 - 1 ha were divided into squares of 10 x 10 m; in each of these quadrats all trees of 5 cm d. b. h. and over were identified and measured. In 10 % of the quadrats also the undergrowth of 2 - 4 ½ cm d. b. h. was enumerated. The method of quadrating is described in III. 1, in which section also emphasize was laid on the fact that both the size of the sample plots and of the quadrats was arbitrarily chosen; the present investigations are only meant to give a first insight in the order of magnitude of the variability existing in the composition of the forest in a small area (Mapane region) as well as over larger distances. The studies were carried out in stands of mesophytic forest belonging to the same “floristic” or “natural” area, which means that every species that was encountered in the sample plots has a natural range which is greater than the region under consideration. Yet, as was clearly demonstrated, the floristic composition of the forests which were sampled showed marked differences (tables XVII and XVIII). The heterogeneity of what is supposed to be a single stand on homogeneous (?) soil appears from the tables in which the results of enumerations in neighbouring plots are given (e. g. tables XIX-XXI). The forest on mesic sites in Suriname is typical mixed forest in that it shows the same pecularities in the distribution of the constituent species as have been described for other equatorial countries: the forest seldom shows any tendency towards single-species dominance; the composition shows distinct variations from place to place; each of the sample plots shows a different assemblage of relatively abundant, “leading” species. The latter do not exceed 20 in number, although in the whole of Suriname there are in the mesophytic forest at least some 200 species of large trees, the majority of which never become codominant. The preliminary study of the forest in Suriname indicates that it might be possible to distinguish geographic regions, within which the forest on mesic sites shows approximately the same group of “leading” species (although within such a region the relative numerical importance of each of the “leading” species shows considerable fluctuations from one place to another). Notwithstanding these heterogeneities the average floristic composition remains more or less the same in such a geographic region. Although it is admitted that some sor...|$|R
