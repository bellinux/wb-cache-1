500|$|CBC Sports head of {{programming}} Trevor Pilling {{explained that the}} large number of events being held, along with the stature of the Pan American Games in comparison to the Olympics, were a factor in the structure of CBC's coverage, stating that [...] "I do think we are the victim of our own success in that having Olympic coverage that is around the clock, but the Olympics are a different event than these Pan Am Games. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> we've done the athletes justice by telling those stories or through live coverage, or with reporters on site. We've tried to make sure we're at all the significant events, and with Canada winning over 180 medals, that's a tall task." ...|$|E
500|$|... "August" [...] was co-written by co-showrunners J. H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, {{while being}} {{directed}} by NCIS veteran Dennis Smith. They began shooting the episode {{during the second}} half of September 2009, right after wrapping production on [...] "Of Human Action". Supervising producer Josh Singer later noted how [...] "August" [...] helped them write the rest of the season, [...] "There was one episode, 'August', which was all about the Observers, that I feel was mythology without being mythology. And somehow, in working that episode, we sort of found a new creative vein. And it's not that that episode was necessarily so related to everything else we did. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it sort of opened us up in terms of how we were feeling about the year".|$|E
500|$|Eveanescence cover artwork was {{introduced}} on the band's website on August 30, 2011. It is their first album cover {{which does not}} feature Lee. In an interview, she discussed the cover: [...] "Well, both of our other records are me on the cover, and I think it's cool to have that photo, you know, that people can look at and go, 'OK, that's who that is.' <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like,</b> by now, they know who we are, and I wanted something really different. I didn't feel like {{we had to put}} a photo on the cover, I wanted it to be more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself, not just me." [...] The cover, black with vapor behind the band's name, is a play on the meaning of [...] "evanescence" [...] ("to dissipate like vapor").|$|E

500|$|Throughout 2016, PewDiePie's video style change {{became more}} {{apparent}} than the tweaks he implemented in the past (see above for more). As aforementioned, PewDiePie addressed his use of words such as gay as a pejorative, retrospectively expressing, [...] "I still make kinda stupid jokes that I shouldn't make. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> back then I didn't understand. I was so immature and I just thought things were funny just because they were offensive [...] I'm not proud of it. I'm really not. But I'm also glad that I've grown past it." [...] While continuing to produce fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour also changed; PewDiePie commented in a December 2016 video, [...] "I think {{the thing is that}} I have a lot of younger audience , and I think my humour got drier, and they don't get it." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{establishing}} {{a friendship with}} recording artist Miley Cyrus in 2013, Gregory E. Miller from the New York Post noted that the media and general public would continue [...] "following her every move". Ferreira commented that [...] " [...] obviously way bigger and all eyes [...] on her, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> we're kind of going through a similar thing where everyone's {{trying to say that}} we're trying to make ourselves objects, but really, everyone else is making it more like that—sensationalizing sex and reading into things. It's nice to have someone that gets it." [...] Ferreira had also generated a minor controversy after appearing topless on the cover for Night Time, My Time, to which she responded [...] "there's nothing about that photo that's pornographic; we came on this earth nude." [...] Ferreira is also a feminist, which has influenced her work; she has said [...] "I feel like I'm doing a bad job of being a feminist if I'm not making someone angry." ...|$|E
500|$|Ferreira {{was largely}} raised by her grandmother, {{who had been}} Michael Jackson's {{personal}} hairstylist for over 30 years. She commented, saying: [...] "I was raised around him, I always saw him [...] had holidays with him and stuff like that", adding that she was unaware of his fame until she was 13 years old. Ferreira expressed interest in singing as a child and, with Jackson's encouragement, Ferreira's grandmother enrolled her in opera lessons. Ferreira has stated that she was sexually assaulted in her adolescence twice, firstly involving a neighbor, and secondly in an incident that involved a stranger who had broken into her home. In an interview with Rookie, Ferreira said: [...] "I've never said anything [...] because I don't want it to define me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it's appropriate to say something [...] People feel like it defines you, and it doesn't. It's really unfortunate and disgusting and traumatizing, but it doesn't make you who you are." [...] Ferreira {{dropped out of high}} school after completing her sophomore year.|$|E

60|$|We had a {{good deal}} of trouble with steam {{launches}} that morning. It was just before the Henley week, and they were going up in large numbers; some by themselves, some towing houseboats. I do hate steam launches: I suppose every rowing man does. I never see a steam launch <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> should <b>like</b> to lure it to a lonely part of the river, and there, in the silence and the solitude, strangle it.|$|R
500|$|In a 1994 interview, Joel {{dismissed}} {{criticism of}} unclear elements in their films: [...] "People {{have a problem}} dealing {{with the fact that}} our movies are not straight-ahead. They would prefer that the last half of Barton Fink just be about a screenwriter's writing-block problems and how they get resolved in the real world...." [...] Talk show host Larry King expressed approval of the movie, despite its uncertain conclusion. He wrote in USA Today: [...] "The ending is something I'm still thinking about and if they accomplished that, I guess it worked." [...] In a 2016 interview, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman said after being asked which film he would want with him on a deserted island, [...] "A movie I really love is Barton Fink. I don’t know if that’s the movie I’d take to a desert island, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> there’s so much in there, you could watch it again and again. That’s important to me, especially if that was the only movie I’d have with {{me for the rest of}} my life." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Best Mistake" [...] {{was written}} by Denisia [...] "Blu June" [...] Andrews, Brittany Coney, Ariana Grande, Big Sean, Corey Jackson Carter, and with production, {{programming}} and instruments done by Key Wane. The vocals were produced by Curtis [...] "Sauce" [...] Wilson, with Gregg Rominiecki engineering Big Sean's vocals. Serban Ghenea handled the mixing of the track, which was engineered by John Hanes, and finally the mix was mastered by Aya Merrill and Tom Coyne. It is a minimal hip-hop piano ballad lament that utilizes instrumentation from strings and a drum machine. It is about a couple trying to [...] "make up their minds {{about the future of}} their relationship, with deep affection buried underneath their problems." [...] Grande revealed that [...] "Best Mistake" [...] was her favorite track on My Everything: [...] "I just think the world of [...] and I'm obsessed with his writing on this song in particular. I'm a huge fan of his in general <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> his writing on this song is so, so fantastic, it like strikes a chord in my heart. I love it so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Linkin Park had professed {{that they}} have been fans of James Jean's art for a while, {{describing}} discussions between the band and Jean as having [...] "started naturally". Joe Hahn served as a creative director for the artwork of The Hunting Party, instructing Jean to [...] "create a universe inhabited by powerful characters and defined by strange landscapes", with a general concept of having a unique [...] "character" [...] for each track on the album. Delson also contributed ideas of [...] "internal and external struggles", metaphorically depicted on a battlefield, where images such as [...] "flesh tearing and transforming into different forms and brittle shards of crystal erupting from organic matter" [...] would recur. Shinoda explained: [...] "We try to approach our art—packaging, merchandise, tour visuals, videos, anything—in a holistic way. All the parts are interconnected, and by creating great imagery {{that can be used in}} multiple contexts, we can immerse the fans in a universe that is consistent and unique to each release. It's always a work in progress, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> we've learned a lot and continue to make it better each time." ...|$|E

5000|$|Trejonda had {{the dubious}} {{distinction}} of earning no points until Week 9. As she herself {{said in the}} intro to Week 4, [...] "Right now, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> the jinx.

500|$|The musical {{covers and}} {{performances}} for the episode were mostly well received by critics and fans alike. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated that her favorite was [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] by Paul McCartney, {{performed by the}} Warblers. In {{a review of the}} performance, she wrote, [...] "This is much more Warbler-esque than 'When I Get You Alone'. I had also been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves. Plus, major points for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when Blaine sang the love 'won't come at all' line to Santana. It was probably my personal biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the episode." [...] She gave the performance an [...] "A". She also praised Puck's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", and opined, [...] "In general, I'm in love with Mark Salling's voice. He's right up there with Artie [...] in my book. And this song was smothered in awesome sauce. Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll." [...] She went on to give the performance an [...] "A−". Kristin Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was a bit more critical of Puck's cover of the song: [...] "This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls'. I know this song fits in with Puck's storyline for the episode, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> the song was in the wrong key for him. At times it sounded like he was straining to hit the higher notes. Because of this, I have to wonder if the backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out. It seems depending on the song selection for him, Salling's vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season." ...|$|E
500|$|By 2001, {{the project}} had become {{stranded}} in development hell. In a Q panel at Comic-Con 2007, Gaiman remarked, [...] "I'd rather see no Sandman movie made than a bad Sandman movie. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> {{the time for}} a Sandman movie is coming soon. We need someone who has the same obsession with the source material as Peter Jackson had with Lord of the Rings or Sam Raimi had with Spider-Man." [...] That same year, he stated that he could imagine Terry Gilliam as a director for the adaptation: [...] "I would always give anything to Terry Gilliam, forever, so if Terry Gilliam ever wants to do Sandman then as far as I'm concerned Terry Gilliam should do Sandman." [...] In 2013, DC President Diane Nelson said that a Sandman film would be as rich as the Harry Potter universe. David S. Goyer announced in an interview in early December that he would be producing an adaptation of the graphic novel, alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Neil Gaiman. Jack Thorne was hired to write the script. On October 16, 2014, Gaiman clarified that while the film was not announced with the DC slate by Warner Bros., it would instead be distributed by Vertigo and announced with those slate of films. Goyer told Deadline.com in an interview that the studio was very happy with the film's script. According to Deadline.com, the film was to be distributed by New Line Cinema. In October 2015, Goyer revealed that a new screenwriter was being brought on board to revise the script by Jack Thorne and stated that he believed the film would go into production the following year. In March 2016, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Eric Heisserer was hired to rewrite the film's script. The next day, Gordon-Levitt announced that he had dropped out due to disagreements with the studio over the creative direction of the film. On November 9, 2016, i09 reported that Heisserer had turned in his draft of the script but left the film, stating that the film should be an HBO series instead.|$|E

In January 2016, Gunn revealed that he had chosen an additional Bowie song to appear in the film, but had cut the original scene it was featured in. The inclusion would have made Bowie the only artist to be featured on both mixtapes. With Bowie's death that month, Gunn hoped {{to find a way to}} include the chosen song somewhere else in the film as a [...] "fair and appropriate" [...] way to honor him, as Bowie was one of Gunn's idols.
