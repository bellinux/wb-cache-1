5|$|In {{a second}} letter, also dated June 18, Dupasquier and Shorrock {{confirmed}} {{that they would}} not permit their teams to race on the Michelin tyres used during qualification without changes to the circuit, and reiterated their request to slow down Turn 13. Whiting's <b>brief</b> <b>reply</b> maintained that no such change would be permitted, and gave the teams the choice of limiting speeds through Turn 13, using tyres of a different specification to those used in qualifying, subject to a penalty, or changing tyres repeatedly, which would have been permitted if a driver's safety were at issue.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Searle gave a <b>brief</b> <b>reply</b> to Derrida in The Construction of Social Reality. He called Derrida's {{conclusion}} [...] "preposterous" [...] {{and stated}} that [...] "Derrida, as far as I can tell, {{does not have an}} argument. He simply declares that there is nothing outside of texts..." [...] Searle's reference here is not to anything forwarded in the debate, but to a mistranslation of the phrase [...] "il n'y a pas de hors-texte" [...] ("there is no outside-text") which appears in Derrida's Of Grammatology (1967).|$|E
2500|$|In his <b>brief</b> <b>reply</b> to Derrida, [...] "Reiterating the Differences: A Reply to Derrida", Searle {{argued that}} Derrida's {{critique}} was unwarranted because it assumed that Austin's theory attempted {{to give a}} full account of language and meaning when its aim was much narrower. Searle considered the omission of parasitic discourse forms to be justified by the narrow scope of Austin's inquiry. Searle agreed with Derrida's proposal that intentionality presupposes iterability, but did not apply the same concept of intentionality used by Derrida, being {{unable or unwilling to}} engage with the continental conceptual apparatus. This, in turn, caused Derrida to criticize Searle for not being sufficiently familiar with phenomenological perspectives on intentionality. Searle also argued that Derrida's disagreement with Austin turned on his having misunderstood Austin's (and Peirce's) type–token distinction and his failure to understand Austin's concept of failure in relation to performativity. Some critics have suggested that Searle, by being so grounded in the analytical tradition, was unable to engage with Derrida's continental phenomenological tradition and was at fault for the unsuccessful nature of the exchange.|$|E
