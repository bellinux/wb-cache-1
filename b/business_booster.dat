40|$|The {{assumption}} that economic prosperity requires growth seems so reasonable {{that most of}} us don't think much about it. After all, it's what we've always been told; politicians, <b>business</b> <b>boosters,</b> economists, and the media all seem to take it for granted. The assumption is so pervasive that virtually every American community is looking for ways to grow out of its economic problems, even when those problems are themselves the result of growth...|$|R

In response, George Baxter (Pierre Watkin) tells him that he would be happier living in New York. Will decides to leave town. After arriving in New York, he is mistaken for an economist named Mr. Wight. When Ruby Miller (Glenda Farrell) a con artists realized the mistake she quietly draws him away. Ruby, a member of a group of con artists plans to extort money from gangster Dizzy Rantz (Cesar Romero) after discovering that he does not own a piece of land under his gambling house. Afraid of Dizzy's reaction, they ask Will to make the demand for them and convincing him that they will build apartments for working people if they gain access to Dizzy's land. When the group discovered that the land is actually owned by Mary Jones (Florence Roberts). They ask Will to charm Mary into signing the land over to him.|$|R
50|$|When Lehigh Valley Railroad {{pushed into}} the Lehigh Valley through (left bank) East Mauch Chunk and (right bank, shared with the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad) Packerton, Pennsylvania, the LC&N {{management}} suddenly got motivated to have Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad finish the connecting line through the Lehigh River Gorge. The LV completed its parallel stretch in the same period, creating news media buzz. Despite their experience with the gravity railroad, LC&N management knew they had much to learn about operating the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad so looked for an operating company to partner with to operate the line; subsequently, as was common practice {{for nearly a century}} with many of the nation's shortline railroads which were built primarily by local <b>business</b> <b>boosters,</b> it was leased to the Central Railroad of New Jersey in 1871 for 999 years and operated it as their Lehigh and Susquehanna Division. In the ensuing years, the Central Railroad of New Jersey would run a prestige express passenger service from New York City and Easton (Philadelphia connection) to Buffalo, New York and points west (Great Lakes region) where they competed with the Lehigh Valley Railroad head to head, parallel tracks sometimes on the same bank or often on the opposite shore of the Susquehanna River.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} be able to use the {{standardized}} multipurpose modeling language UML for the integrated development of business and software systems based on OMG's business object technology, a specialized process model is needed to ensure purposeful and effective development activities. BOOSTER*Process, which is part of a project called <b>BOOSTER</b> (<b>Business</b> Object-Oriented Software Technology for Enterprise Reengineering), describes a multi-level software development process model which meets these requirements and especially emphasizes reuse aspects resulting from the component character of business objects. This paper presents the basic architecture of BOOSTER*Process consisting of four main engineering levels and, in addition, picks out the business modeling activities at the business engineering level as an example. It is shown how UML activity diagrams can be applied in this context replacing independent process modeling notations...|$|R
40|$|Nontraditional {{revenue is}} the term used to {{describe}} sources of funding other than those provided by federal and state support, including grants, and those provided by local property tax levies. Examples included licensing agreements, advertising in school facilities and on school property, school <b>business</b> partnerships, <b>booster</b> clubs, education foundations, and user fees. The {{purpose of this study}} was (1) to identify the sources of nontraditional revenue used by Indiana school corporations and Indiana high schools, (2) to assess local school officials' attitudes and expectations regarding the use of nontraditional revenue, and (3) to provide some insight as to how Indiana school corporations and schools utilize those funds. A QUAN-Qual Model was used for this study. The QUAN-Qual Model enabled the researcher to conduct the study in two phases. The first phase was comprised of a survey instrument used to identify the kinds of nontraditional revenue being used and to collect data regarding the amounts of nontraditional revenue being generated. The instrument was also used to measure attitudes towards nontraditional revenue and the perceived importance of those funds. The second phase was comprised of qualitative data collection through telephone interviews with school corporation and high school administrators conducted in February and March 2006. Analysis and interpretation of that data provided additional information about attitudes towards nontraditional revenue and how those funds are used. All Indiana school corporations and high schools that were included in the study utilized nontraditional revenue sources to varying degrees. They supplemented traditional funding with licensing agreements, school-business partnerships, booster clubs, education foundations, individual donations, and user fees. Nontraditional sources of revenue were identified as being essential for supporting some activities and programs. However, the researcher's sampling of corporation level administrators' and high school principals' attitudes regarding that revenue suggested that neither group relied on it to provide for essential personnel or programs. Statistically significant data suggest that school corporations and schools located in rural settings might be at a disadvantage with respect to their capacity to generate nontraditional revenue.

40|$|Integrating {{methods and}} sources {{from the study}} of Mexican Americans, urban history, and {{historical}} preservation this dissertation examines the interactions of race and space. In the late 1960 's, Arizona's fast urban renewal project, the Pueblo Center Redevelopment Project, resulted in building a new civic center and government complex in Tucson. Construction of the new expansive structure required that the city's oldest barrio or neighborhood be destroyed. In an era when the local economy relied heavily on tourists' dollars, city officials and boosters used urban renewal as an opportunity to eradicate the barrio in order to diminish long-held national convictions of Tucson as too "Mexican. " In the late nineteenth century, Anglo Americans moving to Tucson had displaced Mexican Americans, who moved to the southern edge of town. This demographic shift resulted in the barrio's creation. As a result of de facto segregation, the barrio grew to serve Mexican Americans' consumer and social needs. It became impossible to hide the city's large Mexican American population since the barrio spilled into the central <b>business</b> district. <b>Boosters</b> had constructed the barrio and its residents as obstacles to "progress," targeting it for destruction since the 1930 s. Exemplifying the power of the politics of representation, boosters devised images in their widespread promotional campaigns that they hoped would make Tucson appear more modern and racially homogeneous so that they could attract more tourists. Cultural productions indicate that boosters highlighted the incongruity of a Mexican American space in the city that stood in opposition to the modernity that Anglo American space embodied. City officials avoided updating developmental services in the barrio and refused to enforce housing codes for decades. By the 1960 s, the barrio fit federal standards that qualified it as a "slum. " Two oppositional historical preservation movements emerged as a result the destruction of older and historic structures. Their failures and successes illustrate the process whereby particular histories are legitimated and disseminated while others are marginalized. Mexican Americans attempted to save sites that commemorated the city's Mexican American past, while Anglo Americans succeeded in preserving an exaggerated version of an Anglo past...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of History, Washington State UniversityFly fishing, {{like other}} aspects of the romanticized American West, has taken on a larger-than-life appearance. It seems wonderfully simple, however, the imagery of fly fishing {{suggests}} more than just a sport but rather a religious experience, a transformative western adventure and, mainly, a nostalgic and simplified view of the past. "Trout Culture" unravels the history of this creation of place, starting from the 1860 s with early trout introductions and state regulations of the territorial period and ending with the modern environmental movement and the wild trout era of the 1960 s and 1970 s, when anglers and managers started to dismantle the western hatchery system. Placed in this time period, the iconography of regional fly fishing and the nostalgia for majestic trout streams emerges not as a timeless feature of the West, but rather as the product of anglers, fisheries managers, tourists, guides, local <b>businesses,</b> and regional <b>boosters</b> and their century-long profound manipulation of the Rocky Mountain environment. This study moves beyond purely local and regional stories to explain how local, national, and even transnational forces constructed and reconstructed Rocky Mountain trout fisheries over time. To understand the Rocky Mountain trout culture as a story of shifting meanings and practices, this dissertation shows the crucial importance of focusing on appropriate scales of power and influence in order to add new strength to the field of western history, helping to undermine the provincial aspects of past scholarship. Local and regional people and places, as this study demonstrates, often importantly mediated national and international conservation practices, creating a new way of viewing western conservation that advances recent interpretations by showing how locals shaped state power and conservation. The contemporary struggles of conservationists and fisheries managers to save dozens of native fish species throughout the Rocky Mountains demands a need to reexamine this trout culture and its environmental consequences. With large profits and a dependent regional economy, the tourism and recreation industry provides little incentive to reevaluate the region's problematic association with nonnative trout, even with current scientific and ethical concerns about declines in native species and preserving biodiversity.
