50|$|Hungary's {{most famous}} wine region {{lies in the}} foothills of the Zemplén Mountains of the far north of the country - in fact the {{traditional}} area crosses into the southeast corner of modern Slovakia. The area is notable for its long warm autumns and mists that come in from the River Bodrog, creating perfect conditions for noble rot. This can contribute towards creating the <b>botrytised</b> ('aszú') <b>grapes</b> for which the region is famous. These are individually picked as late as mid-November into buckets ('puttonyos') and crushed to a paste. Varying amounts of this aszú paste are then added to non-aszú must or wine made from a mix of Furmint, Hárslevelű, Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains, Kövérszőlő or Zéta grapes, and left to ferment. The resulting wine is then aged in relatively small barrels in a labyrinth of cellars in the soft volcanic tuff, on whose walls thick blankets of fungus regulate the humidity.|$|R
50|$|According to Hungarian legend {{the first}} aszú (a wine using <b>botrytised</b> <b>grapes)</b> {{was made by}} Laczkó Máté Szepsi in 1630. However, mention of wine made from <b>botrytised</b> <b>grapes</b> had already {{appeared}} in the Nomenklatura of Fabricius Balázs Sziksai, which was completed in 1576. A recently discovered inventory of aszú predates this reference by five years. When vineyard classification began in 1730 in the Tokaj region, one of the gradings given to the various terroirs centered on their potential to develop Botrytis cinerea.|$|E

5000|$|Szamorodni: This type of {{wine was}} {{initially}} known as főbor (prime wine), but from the 1820s Polish merchants popularised the name samorodny, (The word stems from Slovak, the Prekmurje dialect of Slovene, and Kajkavian Croatian, {{which used to be}} spoken before the hungarization of the Pannonian Basin. The word is an adjective and means [...] "self-grown", [...] "the way it was grown", or [...] "made by itself"). What sets Szamorodni apart from ordinary wines is that it is made from bunches of grapes which contain a high proportion of <b>botrytised</b> <b>grapes.</b> Szamorodni is typically higher in alcohol than ordinary wine. Szamorodni often contains up to 100-120 g of residual sugar and thus is termed édes (sweet). However, when the bunches contain less <b>botrytised</b> <b>grapes,</b> the residual sugar content is much lower, resulting in a száraz (dry) wine. Its alcohol content is typically 14%.|$|E
5000|$|Tokajské samorodné suché (samorodné {{derived from}} a Slovak word meaning [...] "the way it was grown", suché means [...] "dry"): Samorodné wine is set apart from {{ordinary}} wine {{in that it is}} made from bunches which contain a considerable proportion of <b>botrytised</b> <b>grapes.</b> Because of this, Samorodné is typically higher in extract than ordinary wine.|$|E
50|$|Tokajský výber (in Hungarian: aszú): This is {{the wine}} which made Tokaj world famous. It is a sweet dessert wine made by {{individually}} picking <b>botrytised</b> <b>grapes</b> and trampling them in huge vats {{to form a}} paste. Must is then poured on the paste and left to soak before the wine is transferred to wooden casks where fermentation in completed. The wines are graded from 3 to 6 putňa (puttony), representing the level of sugar and sugar-free extract in the mature wine.|$|E
50|$|From 1924 Château Doisy Daëne {{has been}} {{owned by the}} Dubourdieu family. Georges Dubourdieu {{acquired}} it from the Debans heirs in 1924. Georges stayed in control until 1949, when his son Pierre Dubourdieu took over. One of Pierre Dubourdieu's innovations, in the early 1950s, was to start also making a dry white wine, {{the first in the}} Sauternes area. In 2000, Pierre's son Denis Dubourdieu took over the control estate. In 1990 {{and as a result of}} an experiment, Denis had introduced l'Extravagant de Doisy-Daëne, a concentrated wine of higher sweetness than usual Sauternes, produced from highly <b>botrytised</b> <b>grapes.</b>|$|E
