The problem faced is the damage that often occurs suddenly on the blowmould machine so that corrective maintenance must be done. The purpose of this research is to know the cause of the damage and to propose the action plan to minimize downtime. The method used is Reliability Centered Maintenance to determine the selection of action and time interval of replacement for critical components on the blowmould machine. From the FMEA analysis, it is known that the critical components of each blowmould machine subsystem are <b>bearing</b> <b>roller</b> feed, mandrel, seal gasket, and fitting. The results of LTA analysis are the category of failure (outage problem and economic problem) and the selection of action for the critical component (time directed). From the calculation of Total Minimum Downtime, known that the replacement schedule for critical component are 23 days for <b>bearing</b> <b>roller</b> feed, 9 days for mandrel, 8 days for seal gasket, and 8 days for fitting, that is resulting in decreased downtime of 1. 56 % with a value of 99. 63 % availabilit...|$|E

BF Goodrich will shortly be using this capability to automate fatigue calculations for rotating aircraft wheels subject to vertical and lateral loads. As part of a validation exercise, an FE model of the wheel was analysed by applying a <b>bearing</b> <b>roller</b> load around the inner surface of the wheel hub at 15 ° increments. A linear static analysis was conducted at each increment to produce a stress tensor history (σx, σy, and τxy) for all surface nodes. Due {{to the nature of}} a rolling wheel, it was expected that the principal stresses and their directions would vary for each increment. For this reason, the stress tensors were also rotated on the model surface through 360 °, at 10 ° increments, to calculate the components of the principal stresses in those directions. All stress data was run through an S-N fatigue life analysis with no mean stress correction. Although not complete, the results are expected to show contour plots of fatigue life and fatigue damage for all nodes at the worst (most damaging) surface angle. MSC. Software envisions that this new capability can also be applied to any rotating body, especially automotive wheels...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With the {{increase}} of people's awareness in health, those busy {{people living in the}} centers of cities can only rely on a treadmill to take physical exercise in life. However, there will be a series of problems to appear in a treadmill if it is used for a too long time, so it is necessary for people to know well the structure of the treadmill and the common faults for solving these problems. In this paper, the types and structures of treadmill as well as the common faults and solutions are specifically introduced. The structure and benefits of treadmill The basic structure of treadmill is very simple, and generally can be divided into motor and controller. Its machinery can be divided into <b>bearing,</b> <b>roller,</b> belt, and running plate. The working principle of treadmill is as follows: the running belt is driven through motor so that people can run or walk through the different speed or gradient, and then the comfortable performance of the exercise is greatly improved, and also a certain effect caused by the adverse factors such as weather and environment on the exercisers is prevented and simultaneously the possibility of the injuries caused by exercise can be reduced. The exercise taken by people on the motor is a mind and body movement process, because this exercise way has no kicking actions basically and makes the exercise intensit...|$|E
40|$|Promptly and {{accurately}} {{dealing with the}} equipment breakdown {{is very important in}} terms of enhancing reliability and decreasing downtime. A novel fault diagnosis method PSO-RVM based on relevance vector machines (RVM) with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for plunger pump in truck crane is proposed. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized to determine the kernel width parameter of the kernel function in RVM, and the five two-class RVMs with binary tree architecture are trained to recognize the condition of mechanism. The proposed method is employed in the diagnosis of plunger pump in truck crane. The six states, including normal state, bearing inner race fault, <b>bearing</b> <b>roller</b> fault, plunger wear fault, thrust plate wear fault, and swash plate wear fault, are used to test the classification performance of the proposed PSO-RVM model, which compared with the classical models, such as back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), ant colony optimization artificial neural network (ANT-ANN), RVM, and support vectors, machines with particle swarm optimization (PSO-SVM), respectively. The experimental results show that the PSO-RVM is superior to the first three classical models, and has a comparative performance to the PSO-SVM, the corresponding diagnostic accuracy achieving as high as 99. 17 % and 99. 58 %, respectively. But the number of relevance vectors is far fewer than that of support vector, and the former is about 1 / 12 – 1 / 3 of the latter, which indicates that the proposed PSO-RVM model is more suitable for applications that require low complexity and real-time monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Measurement {{techniques}} {{are applied to}} tribocomponents at three size scales. Device-level parameters are assessed in a displacement-controlled axial bearing test rig. Component-level testing is performed using a miniature radio telemeter embedded in a <b>bearing</b> <b>roller.</b> Contact pressure and temperature are measured with thin-film contact sensors fabricated on steel and glass disks and loaded in an optical EHL (elastohydrodynamic lubrication) test system. ^ Low crosstalk bearing torque measurements were made with a compliant fixed shaft and two RF (radio frequency) proximity sensors. Use of single components for multiple functions permitted the fabrication of a 5 by 9 by 1. 5 millimeter sensor/telemeter weighing 80 milligrams. Data was transmitted using thermal frequency modulation of oscillator tank capacitance. Telemeter output sensitivity of the thermal frequency modulation technique at temperatures above 40 °C was 15 KHz/MHz-°C. A comparative analysis of signal conditioner bandwidth, spatial averaging and capacitive coupling facilitates determination of the speed-limiting aspect of a thin-film contact sensor. Techniques for photolithographic patterning of zirconium, a material exhibiting a low pressure coefficient of resistance, have been developed. ^ Load increments up to 10 % associated with component heating and with oil film development in tapered roller bearing contacts were measured using the axial bearing tester. Rapid thermal response to loss of lubricant of instrumented bearing rollers indicates great potential of the technology in condition monitoring. Pressure distributions measured in grease-lubricated contacts loaded to peak Hertz stress levels of 0. 78 to 0. 87 GPa were indicative of the base oils, with no thickener-induced broadening observed. ...|$|E

50|$|Tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> use conical <b>rollers</b> {{that run}} on conical races. Most <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> only take radial or axial loads, but tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> support both radial and axial loads, and {{generally}} can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. Tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy loads the tapered roller is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the <b>roller</b> in the <b>bearing</b> adds to bearing friction compared to ball bearings.|$|R
