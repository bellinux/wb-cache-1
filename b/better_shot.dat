5|$|The {{skirmish}} {{became a}} full-scale battle by 4:00p.m. After the Americans drove Captain Pipe's Delawares {{out of the}} woods and onto to prairie, the Delawares were reinforced by Dunquat's Wyandots. Elliott also arrived on the scene and coordinated the actions of the Delawares and the Wyandots. Pipe's Delawares skillfully outflanked the American position and then attacked their rear. A few Indians crept close to the American lines in the tall prairie grass. The Americans responded by climbing trees to get a <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> at them. Gunsmoke filled the air, making it difficult to see. After {{three and a half hours}} of incessant firing, the Indians gradually broke off the attack with the approach of nightfall. Both sides slept with arms at the ready, and surrounded their positions with large fires to prevent surprise night attacks.|$|E

In a controversial incident in game four, an Alfredsson slap shot hit Ducks captain Scott Niedermayer {{at the end of the}} second period, leading to speculation that Alfredsson intended to injure Niedermayer. Alfredsson dismissed the notion, saying that he had glanced up at the clock to see if he had time to move in for a <b>better</b> <b>shot,</b> and then quickly fired in the heat of an important game.|$|E

25|$|AirPort debuted on July 21, 1999, at Macworld New York, with Steve Jobs {{picking up}} an iBook {{supposedly}} {{to give the}} cameraman a <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> as he surfed the Web. The initial offering consisted of an optional expansion card for Apple's new line of iBook notebooks and an AirPort Base Station. The AirPort card (a repackaged Lucent ORiNOCO Gold Card PC Card adapter) was later added as an option for almost all of Apple's product line, including PowerBooks, eMacs, iMacs, and Power Macs. Only Xserves do not have it as a standard or optional feature. The original AirPort system allowed transfer rates up to 11 Mbit/s and was commonly used to share Internet access and files between multiple computers.|$|E
25|$|However, Toronto was {{not about}} to give up on Bargnani yet and {{committed}} the entire summer coaching him to become a more effective interior player, forcing him to drive to the basket more and settle less for jump shots. The arrival of six-time NBA All-Star Jermaine O'Neal also meant that Bargnani was likely to come off the bench in most games, with Bosh and O'Neal forming the starting frontcourt. During the summer he worked hard on his body, putting up some more weight (adding some 15 pounds of muscle); this work showed his effects in the first games of the regular campaign, when the Italian was more willing to rebound in traffic and drive to the basket. He also seemed to rediscover his shooting stroke, had <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> selection and became a consistent shot-blocker, and he was soon moved to the starting line-up as small forward.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts, King played then-BDO player John Henderson in {{his last}} group game. Despite winning the game 5–4, he {{exchanged}} heated words with Henderson {{towards the end of}} the match and was visibly unhappy. Whilst refusing to reveal the precise reason to his actions, it was understood through television analysis that King felt Henderson, after having to move across the oche for a <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> with his third dart, had stepped across the oche line and thrown from a closer distance to the board, thus believing he had gained an unfair advantage. It was also discovered that King had complained to the match referee, George Noble, about the alleged infringement. Many pundits, most notably Chris Mason, pointed out that Henderson rarely checks his standing position before throwing, and publicly criticised King for insinuating that Henderson cheated. However, two days later King admitted that he had overreacted after watching the match again on television and apologised to Henderson during a pre-match interview. King was booed by the crowd while attempting to hit a double four to win in the deciding leg of the second round match against James Wade; he failed, and lost.|$|E

Weber first played {{organized}} ice hockey {{at the age of}} six. Growing up he played in the Sicamous and District Minor Hockey Association, a division of the British Columbia Amateur Hockey Association (BCAHA), often switching between forward and defenceman positions. In Weber's second year of bantam, he permanently switched to defence. He credits his father for convincing him to make the switch because he thought Weber would [...] "have a <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> at a pro career as a defenceman". Between the ages of fourteen and fifteen, Weber grew 5inches, from 5-foot-9 (1.75 metres) to 6-foot-2 (1.88 metres).|$|E
500|$|The game's visuals and {{atmosphere}} received similar praise. GameSpot reviewer Kevin VanOrd remarked that Mass Effect 2 is more detailed and darker than its predecessor. He wrote that [...] "deep reds and glowing indigos saturate certain scenes, making them {{richer and more}} sinister; eerie fog limits your vision in one side mission, while rain pours down upon you in another. Subtle, moody lighting gives certain interactions great impact." [...] Reviewer Adriaan den Ouden of RPGamer credited the conversations and cutscenes for being <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> than the first game, stating that [...] "it's hard to imagine them becoming much better in Mass Effect 3". Critics also gave high marks to the game's extensive cast of voices, in particular Martin Sheen's performance of the Illusive Man, which was singled out for [...] "steal the show". Andrew Reiner, writing for Game Informer, opined that the music [...] "flows beautifully" [...] in both the story and action sequences. The game's presentation and direction were considered [...] "miles ahead of the competition".|$|E

500|$|NBC were {{positive}} about the project, {{but there was still}} some concern that the homosexual subject matter would cause alarm. Ellen DeGeneres' sitcom Ellen that aired on ABC was canceled the year before Will & Grace premiered because ratings had plummeted after the show became [...] "too gay". Despite the criticism ABC received for DeGeneres' coming out episode, [...] "The Puppy Episode", [...] "there's no question that show made it easier for Will & Grace to make it on the air," [...] said Kohan. He added, [...] "Will & Grace had a <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> at succeeding where Ellen failed, however, because Will has known about his homosexuality for twenty years. He's not exploring that awkward territory {{for the first time as}} Ellen did. The process of self-discovery and the pain most gay men go through is fascinating, but the average American is put off by it." [...] Kohan also commented that rather than concentrating on Will's sexuality, Will & Grace is using it as a device: [...] "It's like that When Harry Met Sally... line when Billy Crystal says, 'A man and woman can never be friends, because sex always gets in the way.' What we want to explore is what happens between a man and a woman when sex doesn't get in the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Reilly further {{added that}} the renewal was also {{prompted}} by the high risk of trying to replace Fringe with another show with unknown viewership metrics; he commented that they [...] "have a far <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> of sticking with a show that has an audience that [...] think [...] can grow". Prior to {{the onset of the}} fourth season, Reilly reiterated that they do not expect any significant growth in Fringes viewership within that season: [...] "It’s a pretty complex show. If Fringe can do exactly what Fringe did last year, we’re going to be very happy. They’re right in the pocket creatively once again." [...] Wyman stated in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that the Fox network had been [...] "supportive throughout this process", and though the show's viewership [...] "wasn't exactly what they would've hoped for", aspects such as a loyal fan base and supportive critics were enough to take the show forward for another season. Pinkner commented that [...] "there were no creative conditions" [...] on the show's renewal, nor any cuts in the show's budget, though was unsure if the show will be moved to a different time slot. Noble, at the 2011 Comic-Con Fringe panel, reiterated that the fans were responsible for the livelihood of the show, stated, [...] "Seriously, without your efforts, your rabid support, we wouldn’t be here right now. You are the best fans that ever existed". The fourth season premiered on September 23, 2011.|$|E

2500|$|The NBL and the {{international}} UCI uses the [...] "Olympic" [...] or Moto System of advancing to the Main. In the Moto System, you must race all three times to make the main or if the race is a large one semi finals. It is a formula combining how well you do with all the registered participant riders in your class racing all three times. It cumulatively determines who will race in the finals. The higher your points total, {{the more likely you}} will advance. For instance if you come in 1st, 1st and 1st, 40+50+60, which is 150 points, you are a virtual certainty to race in the Main (or in large races you are merely transferred to the quarter/semi-finals) barring disqualification for some reason. If you come in Last, Last, First, which in a race with eight men in your class translates to 0+0+60 or 60 points, you MIGHT race in the main (or in larger races the 1/8/quarter/semi finals) determining how well the others did. The person who came in 3rd place in all three motos or 30+40+50=120p would have a much <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> at making the Main than you.

2500|$|He {{improved}} his fitness {{and was one}} of two wicket keepers selected for the 1957-58 tour of South Africa. Grout's competitor for the Test spot was Barry Jarman, and to make matters worse, he had sustained a hairline thumb fracture. Downplayed the injury, he picked up 95 in an innings at Benoni and was given the nod. He made his Test debut against in the first test against South Africa at Wanderers Stadium on 23–28 December 1957. Grout got off to a bad start, and allowed eight byes in the first innings in what he called [...] "a severe attack of the fumbles". During the second innings, he was helped by some inspired bowling from Alan Davidson and took what was then a record six catches behind the stumps. Grout was impressed at the grounds and the hospitality on the South African tour, yet it was not without its risks; early on, some of the Australians (not Grout) were quoted in the local press as being unimpressed with the South African opening bowlers Adcock and Heine, this fired them up and Grout and teammate Les Favell copped a barrage of fearsome bowling in a match against Transvaal. The two fired down numerous bouncers against the Australians in the last innings of the fifth test. Grout and Neil Harvey faced danger of a different kind as the two were chased by elephants and lions in Wanke Games Reserve after Harvey left the vehicle attempting to get a <b>better</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E

50|$|While {{they tend}} to make {{relatively}} few errors {{because they do not}} attempt the complicated and ambitious shots of the aggressive baseliner, the effective counterpuncher must be able to periodically execute an aggressive shot, either using the pace given by their opponent or using precision and angle.

Returning every aggressive shot that the opponent provides is often the cause of further errors due to the effort required in trying increasingly harder and <b>better</b> <b>shots.</b> However, it is noted that for some faster players, including Gaël Monfils, Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Murray, standing too deep behind the court can hinder their attacking abilities.|$|R

2500|$|Shotshell presses are {{generally}} a single {{unit of the}} [...] "H" [...] configuration that handles all functions, dedicated to reloading just one gauge of shotshell. Shotshell reloading is similar to cartridge reloading, except that, instead of a bullet, a wad and a measure of shot are used, and after loading the shot, the shell is crimped shut. Both 6 and 8 fold crimps are in use, for paper hulls and plastic hulls, respectively. [...] Likewise, roll crimps are in use for metallic, paper, and plastic hulls. [...] The shotshell loader contains stations to resize the shell, measure powder, load the wad, measure shot, and crimp the shell. Due to the low cost of modern plastic shotshells, and the additional complexity of reloading fired shells, shotshell handloading is not as popular as cartridge handloading. [...] For example, unlike when handloading rifle and pistol cartridges, where all the various components (cases, gas checks, powder, primers, etc.) from different manufacturers are usually all interchangeable, shotshells typically are loaded for particular brands of shotshell cases (called hulls) only with one specific brand of wad, shot cup (if used), primer, and powder, further increasing the complexity and difficulty of reloading shotshells. Substitution of components is not considered safe, as changing just one component, such as a brand of primer, can increase pressures {{by as much as}} 3500 PSI, which may exceed SAAMI pressure limits. [...] Reloading shotshells is therefore more along the lines of precisely following a recipe with non-fungible components. [...] Where shotshell reloading remains popular, however, is for making specialized shotgun shells, such as for providing lowered recoil, when making low-cost [...] "poppers" [...] used for training retrievers before hunting season to acclimate hunting dogs to the sound of a gun firing without actually shooting projectiles, for achieving <b>better</b> <b>shot</b> patterning, or for providing other improvements or features not available in commercially loaded shotshells at any price, such as when handloading obsolete shotshells with brass cases for gauges of shotshells that are no longer commercially manufactured.|$|E
