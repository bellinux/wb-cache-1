50|$|When baggage is {{checked in}} at the ticket counter or with a sky cap (where it {{receives}} a <b>bag</b> <b>tag</b> indicating the passenger's itinerary), it is often placed onto a moving bag belt which carries the baggage to the bag room. This is where numerous checked bags are sorted {{so that they will}} be loaded onto the proper flight. The <b>bag</b> <b>tag</b> which was previously affixed to the baggage during check-in is then read by a baggage handler and placed into the proper bag cart (usually a 4-wheeled trailer) or Unit Load Device (ULD; a machine-loadable container). The bag cart or ULD is then eventually pulled from the bag room by a bag tug and out to the aircraft for loading by baggage handlers.|$|E

5000|$|In 2016, Ostreicher created GeeFi {{partnering with}} Hong Kong-based YouYou Mobile, a {{portable}} device that provides frequent travelers unlimited high speed 4G internet {{in more than}} 100 countries. In November 2016, GeeFi launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter which raised $213,404 in 34 days exceeding original goal of $20,000. However, as of the middle of July 2017, {{he has yet to}} deliver the device to all of his backers, and has renegged on the promise of actual unlimited 4G internet for Kickstarter backers, instead capping users at 500Meg (in a few countries 1Gig) of 4G internet, then severely throttling speeds. [...] Communications from the company to their customers continue to be poor at best and the company itself has described the situation as a mess. Additionally, backers have identified a critical design flaw that requires a user to burn a $10 24 hour day pass {{in order to keep the}} software on the device updated; the user has no way to stop this, except to keep the device off. In 2017, he patented One <b>Bag</b> <b>Tag,</b> together with his mentor and long-time friend Bryan Leibman and cousin Chuck Weinreb which provides luggage tracking service for air travels.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper mainly {{deals with}} the Implementation of RFID in health care. It is {{primarily}} driven {{by a desire to}} improve patient safety and enhance the efficiency of the supply chain. This guideline, following a short technical overview and some examples from industry, assesses high level advantages and disadvantages of using RFID in transfusion medicine and identifies specific areas where RFID solutions might beneficially apply. It covers the use of RFID in the blood product supply chain from bag manufacturing to the donor and to the patient. This paper has focused on RFID solution components and a number of technical recommendations including choice of the radio frequency to be applied, tag capacity, functionality, and data structure to be considered when deploying RFID technology for transfusion medicine. The data structure of the blood <b>bag</b> <b>tag</b> accommodates the needs of all stakeholders in the transfusion medicine supply chain, including: RFID tag manufacturers, bag manufactures, blood centers, and hospital transfusion services. RFID may also increase accuracy of tracking time and temperature and reduce product waste, thus increasing quality and availability of blood products for patients. RFID technology can help ensure appropriate transfusion of the right blood to the right patient, thus reducing errors at the bedside and increasing patient safety...|$|E

30|$|Considering the {{methodology}} described by Yang et al. [39] {{we have created}} our dictionary based on the metadata from NUS-WIDE database. Annotations from the multimedia content are organized {{in a group of}} “bags”, each bag relating to a specific multimedia file (in our case Flickr images are used). For each unique parent tag, we have considered all <b>bags</b> of <b>tags</b> that contain that same parent tag. The correlation between all the child tags, other than the parent tag, and the parent tag, is calculated by the frequency of occurrence of each of the child words appearing in the <b>bags</b> of <b>tags.</b> The list of child words is sorted by their co-occurring frequency. To reduce noise, we have decided to limit the minimum correlation value to 0.1. This means that the correlation dictionary, stored in our database, has correlation values in the range of 0.1 – 1.|$|R

40|$|Luggage {{handling}} is {{an extremely}} complex system that involves many moving parts at once. Due {{to the importance of}} a well-functioning baggage handling system in airports, an analysis has been completed on the current system and its drawbacks. The research is limited to the standard baggage handling system and baggage screening technology currently used in airports. Conclusions have been drawn from past research studies that have been done in major airports, as well as research on better technology the industry is currently working to implement. It has been determined that there are millions of bags mishandled each year, costing the airline industry millions of dollars. As a result, airlines and airports are investing in the testing and implementation of new technologies such as RFID baggage <b>tags,</b> automated <b>bag</b> drop kiosks, and permanent <b>bag</b> <b>tags.</b> These technologies are thought to improve the efficiency and accuracy of luggage handling, benefiting airports, airlines, and passengers. In the future, it is likely travelers and airlines will see an improvement in the number of mishandled bags and cost savings with the potential benefits of improved technology...|$|R
