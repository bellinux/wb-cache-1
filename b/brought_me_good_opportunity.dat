60|$|During {{the three}} weeks that I stayed at Panghu it rained nearly every day, {{either in the}} {{afternoon}} only, or all day long; but there were generally a few hours' sunshine in the morning, and I took advantage of these to explore the roads and paths, the rocks and ravines, in search of insects. These were not very abundant, yet I saw enough {{to convince me that}} the locality was a good one, had I been there at the beginning instead of {{at the end of the}} dry season. The natives <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> daily a few insects obtained at the Sagueir palms, including some fine Cetonias and stag-beetles. Two little boys were very expert with the blowpipe, and <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> a <b>good</b> many small birds, which they shot with pellets of clay. Among these was a pretty little flower-pecker of a new species (Prionochilus aureolimbatus), and several of the loveliest honeysuckers I had yet seen. My general collection of birds was, however, almost at a standstill; for though I at length obtained a man to shoot for me, he was not good for much, and seldom <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> more than one bird a day. The best thing he shot was the large and rare fruit-pigeon peculiar to Northern Celebes (Carpophaga forsteni), which I had long been seeking.|$|R
60|$|The owl lit upon a knoll, not {{two hundred}} yards from where I sat motionless, and gave <b>me</b> a <b>good</b> <b>opportunity</b> of {{watching}} him at his meal. He treated the fish exactly {{as he would have}} treated a rat or duck: stood on it with one foot, gripped the long claws of the other through it, and tore it to pieces savagely, as one would a bit of paper. The beak was not used, except to receive the pieces, which were conveyed up to it by his foot, as a parrot eats. He devoured everything--fins, tail, skin, head, and most of the bones, in great hungry mouthfuls. Then he hopped {{to the top of the}} knoll, sat up straight, puffed out his feathers to look big, and went to sleep. But with the first slight movement I made to creep nearer, he was wide awake and flew to a higher point. Such hearing is simply marvelous.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I will {{introduce}} {{the work of}} one Kenyan healer, Mr. Wellington Masatia Tambwa. The paper {{is divided into two}} parts. The first part discusses the theme of healing and medicine in Africa and gives a short evaluative overview of the works of Edward E. Evans-Pritchard, Huges, John S. Mbiti, K. Thairu and Raimo Harjula. The purpose of this discussion is to show the gap which, I argue, should be filled by scholars interested in this theme in Africa. The second part of this paper discusses the work of Masatia Tambwa. This contributes to fill the aforesaid gap. Empirical data for this paper comes from a number of people, whom I interviewed in Bunyore. It would be difficult to name all of them here, so I will name only a few: Joseph Osuka, Fronika Ayoti Osuka and John Irili. Discussions with these people offered <b>me</b> a <b>good</b> <b>opportunity</b> to learn about the healer Masatia Tambwa and his background. Much information concerning the medicine man came from discussions with Masatia himself...|$|R
6000|$|From {{the top of}} {{the second}} moraine, a very curious scene opened up the valley, of another but more stony and desolate level lake-bed, through which the Yangma (here very rapid) rushed, cutting a channel about sixty feet deep; the flanks of this second lake-bed were cut most {{distinctly}} into two principal terraces, which were again subdivided into others, so that the general appearance was that of many raised beaches, but each so broken up, that, {{with the exception of one}} on the banks of the river, none were continuous for any distance. We descended 200 feet, and crossed the valley and river obliquely in a north-west direction, to a small temple and convent which stood on a broad flat terrace under the black, precipitous, west flank: this gave <b>me</b> a <b>good</b> <b>opportunity</b> of examining the structure of this part of the valley, which was filled with an accumulation, probably 200 feet thick at the deepest part, of angular gravel and enormous boulders, both imbedded in the gravel, and strewed on the flat surfaces of the terraces.

6000|$|The insects {{were more}} abundant, and very interesting. Of {{butterflies}} I caught thirty-five species, {{most of them}} new to me, and many quite unknown in European collections. Among them was the fine yellow and black Papilio euchenor, of which but few specimens had been previously captured, and several other handsome butterflies of large size, {{as well as some}} beautiful little [...] "blues," [...] and some brilliant dayflying moths. The beetle tribe were less abundant, yet I obtained some very fine and rare species. On the leaves of a slender shrub in an old clearing I found several fine blue and black beetles of the genus Eupholus, which almost rival in beauty the diamond beetles of South America. Some cocoa-nut palms in blossom on the beach were frequented by a fine green floral beetle (Lomaptera) which, when the flowers were shaken, flew off like a small swarm of bees. I got one of our crew to climb up the tree, and he <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> a <b>good</b> number in his hand; and seeing they were valuable, I sent him up again with my net to shake the flowers into, and thus secured a large quantity. My best capture, however, was the superb insect of the Buprestis family, already mentioned as having been obtained from the natives, who told me they found it in rotten trees in the mountains.|$|R

40|$|The ever {{changing}} {{social values}} of today {{have caused a}} need to reevaluate the ability of our public spaces to meet societal needs. The desire for public facilities have increased over the years, and urban sprawl is under more and more scrutiny as society develops new opinions about {{what is best for}} our environment. Multiuse public facilities, such as community centers, are sprouting up in many communities because of the increasing need of public spaces for gathering, from small clubs to town meetings. Such is the case for Kosciusko County, Indiana. The county's needs include (but are not limited to) a core facility, auditorium, library annex, convention center, day care center, youth center, and vocational center.

30|$|Gregg and Petrongolo (2005) {{state that}} the {{unstable}} results of papers that study the parameters of matching functions result in a certain misspecification of the matching function due to the assumption of (completely) random search. These authors propose to utilise a stock-flow matching model framework, originally derived by Coles (1994) and Coles and Smith (1998). This approach considers job searching that is not completely random. However, for this, it must state an assumption that might {{be understood as a}} further restriction of the random matching approach: the assumption is made that the agents {{on both sides of the}} market are able to sample the entire relevant part of the stocks of the other side with no friction due to the availability of quite efficient information channels. Following that, the agents who did not found adequate offers and, therefore, remain in the unemployed or vacancy stocks, respectively, only select further offers on the other market side from those that have just arrived. However, Gregg and Petrongolo (2005) concluded that the true (single) matching process is equivalent to one that is somewhere between the random matching approach and the stock-flow matching approach. Whereas random matching assumes a search process that consumes time to sample and assess all available and relevant (stocks of) offers from the other market side, the stock-flow matching approach is assumed to minimise the required time to check the stocks of the other market side to zero. These concepts offer <b>me</b> a <b>good</b> <b>opportunity</b> to discuss the robustness of the focussed efficiency parameter estimates on the basis of two different matching functions.|$|R
60|$|I {{was obliged}} to remain in San Francisco for several days before I found a vessel. This gave <b>me</b> a <b>good</b> <b>opportunity</b> of {{comparing}} the San Francisco of 1852 with that of 1853. As before stated, there had been but one wharf {{in front of the}} city in 1852--Long Wharf. In 1853 the town had grown out into the bay beyond what was the end of this wharf when I first saw it. Streets and houses had been built out on piles where the year before the largest vessels visiting the port lay at anchor or tied to the wharf. There was no filling under the streets or houses. San Francisco presented the same general appearance as the year before; that is, eating, drinking and gambling houses were conspicuous for their number and publicity. They were on the first floor, with doors wide open. At {{all hours of the day}} and night in walking the streets, the eye was regaled, on every block near the water front, by the sight of players at faro. Often broken places were found in the street, large enough to let a man down into the water below. I have but little doubt that many of the people who went to the Pacific coast in the early days of the gold excitement, and have never been heard from since, or who were heard from for a time and then ceased to write, found watery graves beneath the houses or streets built over San Francisco Bay.|$|R

60|$|On {{the second}} of July the mate came below drunk as usual, and in an {{excessively}} good-humor. He came to Augustus's berth, and, giving him {{a slap on the}} back, asked him if he thought he could behave himself if he let him loose, and whether he would promise not to be going into the cabin again. To this, of course, my friend answered in the affirmative, when the ruffian set him at liberty, after making him drink from a flask of rum which he drew from his coat-pocket. Both now went on deck, and I did not see Augustus for about three hours. He then came below with the good news that he had obtained permission to go about the brig as he pleased anywhere forward of the mainmast, and that he had been ordered to sleep, as usual, in the forecastle. He <b>brought</b> <b>me,</b> too, a <b>good</b> dinner, and a plentiful supply of water.
