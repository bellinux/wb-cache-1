5|$|After {{restoring}} the Beanstar, Mario and Luigi travel to Joke's End {{to make the}} exchange, once again traveling through a maze filled with puzzles to be solved. Bowletta refuses to hand over Peach, but Luigi, disguised in Peach's spare dress, ends up being taken in Peach's stead. He escapes from the repaired Koopa Cruiser, reclaiming the Beanstar in the process. The <b>brothers</b> return to Beanbean Castle Town, finding it under attack by Bowletta using Bowser's flying castle. The <b>brothers</b> and Prince Peasley fly up to it to stop Cackletta. Mario and Luigi battle past the Koopalings, but before they can reach Bowletta the <b>brothers</b> encounter Fawful yet again. A fierce battle between the three ensues with the <b>brothers</b> coming out on top. But Fawful plays a dirty trick and attacks the <b>brothers</b> while they weren't paying attention. However, Prince Peasly comes in and send Fawful flying, seemingly defeating him. The Bros. finally confront Bowletta and another epic battle begins. Feigning defeat, she tricks the <b>brothers</b> and swallows them. After waking up in her belly, the <b>brothers</b> battle and defeat Cackletta's soul, exorcising her from Bowser's body. The two are regurgitated and Bowser returns to normal. Afterwards, the <b>brothers</b> escape the castle before it explodes from a bomb set by Peasley. The explosion sends the castle falling into the ocean. Exhausted from their vacation, Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toadsworth decide {{to head back to}} the Mushroom Kingdom. Before they can leave, Peasley brings a farewell gift for them to take home, which is Bowser, who regained his memory. The gang then returns home, and a movie based on their adventure is being shown at the Yoshi Theatre.|$|E

5|$|Anti-Earp {{writers and}} {{researchers}} use Frank Waters' Earp <b>Brothers</b> of Tombstone, {{as their primary}} source for material that presents Wyatt Earp {{as something of a}} villainous monster, aided and abetted by his <b>brothers</b> who were almost brutes. Waters detested the Earps so badly that he presented a book that was terribly flawed, poorly edited, and brimming with prevarications. In his other work, Waters is poetic. In the Earp <b>Brothers</b> of Tombstone, he {{is little more than a}} tabloid hack, trying to slander someone he dislikes. To date, no reason has been uncovered for the bias Frank Waters exhibited against Wyatt Earp and his <b>brothers.</b>|$|E
