50|$|The {{following}} standard prostaglandins {{have the}} following relative efficacies in binding to and activating EP2: PGE2>PGF2alpha>=PGI2>PGD2. The receptor binding affinity Dissociation constant Kd (i.e. ligand concentration needed to bind with 50% of available EP1 receptors) is ~13 nM for PGE2 and ~10 nM for PGE1 {{with the human}} receptor and ~12 nM for PGE2 with the mouse receptor. Because PGE2 activates multiple prostanoid receptors and has a short half-life in vivo due to its rapidly metabolism in cells by omega oxidation and beta oxidation, metabolically resistant EP2-selective activators are useful {{for the study of}} this receptor's function and could be clinically useful for the treatment of certain diseases. There are several such agonists including <b>butaprost</b> free acid and ONO-AE1-259-01 which have Ki inhibitory binding values (see Biochemis try#Receptor/ligand binding affinity) of 32 and 1.8 NM, respectively, and therefore are respectively ~2.5-fold less and 7-fold more potent than PGE2.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the toxicity of the E-prostanoid 2 (EP 2) receptor agonist, <b>butaprost</b> against human subconjunctival (Tenon’s capsule) fibroblasts, {{and to determine}} the underlying mechanism. METHODS: We isolated Tenon’s fibroblasts from the subconjunctival area of healthy subjects and evaluated the types of EP receptors expressed using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The toxicity of <b>butaprost</b> against the fibroblasts was evaluated using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium and lactic dehydrogenase assays. The inhibition of conjunctival fibroblast proliferation by <b>butaprost</b> was assessed by measuring α-actin levels. The underlying mechanism was assessed by measuring intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Intergroup differences were statistically analyzed using an independent t-test. Densitometry of the Western blot bands was performed using the Image J software. RESULTS: Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that the fibroblast EP 2 receptor levels were {{higher than those of}} the other EP receptors. <b>Butaprost</b> did not show toxicity against Tenon’s tissue, but inhibited conjunctival fibroblast proliferation by reducing collagen synthesis. EP 2 receptor activation enhanced the cAMP cascade, which might be an important mechanism underlying this effect. CONCLUSION: <b>Butaprost</b> effectively reduces the subconjunctival scarring response. Given the significance of wound healing modulation in blebs, butaprost’s inhibitory effect on subconjunctival Tenon’s fibroblasts may be beneficial in managing postoperative scarring in glaucoma surgery...|$|E
40|$|Using {{gene chip}} technology, we first {{identified}} that PGF 2 α (FP agonist) and <b>Butaprost</b> (EP 2 agonist) induced about a five-fold upregulation of Nur 77 mRNA expression in hFP-HEK 293 /EBNA and hEP 2 -HEK 293 /EBNA cells. Northern Blot {{analysis revealed that}} PGF 2 α- and Butaprost-induced upregulation of Nur 77 expression are dose- and time-dependent. Both PGF 2 α and <b>Butaprost</b> upregulated Nur 77 gene expression through the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. These data are the first showing a link between EP 2 receptor stimulation and protein kinase C activation. Calcineurin {{was found to be}} involved downstream of the PKC pathway in PGF 2 α-induced Nur 77 expression, but not in Butaprost-induced Nur 77 expression. We also used Nur 77 as a marker gene to compare the effects of PGF 2 α, <b>Butaprost,</b> and Bimatoprost (a prostamide) on Nur 77 expression in human primary trabecular meshwork and ciliary smooth muscle (SM) cells, which are target cells for antiglaucoma drugs. The results showed that PGF 2 α and <b>Butaprost,</b> but not Bimatoprost, induced upregulation of Nur 77 expression in human TM cells. PGF 2 α, but not Bimatoprost, dramatically induced upregulation of Nur 77 mRNA expression in human ciliary SM cells, whereas <b>Butaprost</b> slightly upregulated Nur 77 mRNA expression in SM cells. Nur 77 promoter deletion analysis indicated that PGF 2 α, but not Bimatoprost, activated Nur 77 promoter-luciferase reporter in hFP-HEK 293 /EBNA cells. <b>Butaprost</b> was less efficacious in inducing Nur 77 promoter-luciferase reporter activity in hEP 2 -HEK 293 /EBNA cells relative to PGF 2 α in the comparable assay. The data for Nur 77 promoter functional analysis were matched to the Northern blot analysis. It appears that PGF 2 α and <b>Butaprost</b> activate Nur 77 transcription mechanisms through the activation of FP and EP 2 receptor-coupled signaling pathways, whereas Bimatoprost stimulates neither FP nor EP 2 receptors...|$|E
40|$|In the kidney, {{the actions}} of {{vasopressin}} on its type- 2 receptor (V 2 R) induce increased water reabsorption alongside polyphosphorylation and membrane targeting of the water channel aquaporin- 2 (AQP 2). Loss-of-function mutations in the V 2 R cause X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Treatment of this condition would require bypassing the V 2 R to increase AQP 2 membrane targeting, but currently no specific pharmacological therapy is available. The present study examined specific E-prostanoid receptors for this purpose. In vitro, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and selective agonists for the E-prostanoid receptors EP 2 (<b>butaprost)</b> or EP 4 (CAY 10580) all increased trafficking and ser- 264 phosphorylation of AQP 2 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Only PGE 2 and <b>butaprost</b> increased cAMP and ser- 269 phosphorylation of AQP 2. Ex vivo, PGE 2, <b>butaprost,</b> or CAY 10580 increased AQP 2 phosphorylation in isolated cortical tubules, whereas PGE 2 and <b>butaprost</b> selectively increased AQP 2 membrane accumulation in kidney slices. In vivo, a V 2 R antagonist caused a severe urinary concentrating defect in rats, which was greatly alleviated by treatment with <b>butaprost.</b> In conclusion, EP 2 and EP 4 agonists increase AQP 2 phosphorylation and trafficking, likely through different signaling pathways. Furthermore, EP 2 selective agonists can partially compensate for a nonfunctional V 2 R, providing a rationale for new treatment strategies for hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus...|$|E

Having previously shown these human ovarian cells to express functional G-protein coupled, E-series prostaglandin (PTGER) 1, PTGER 2 and PTGER 4 receptors, {{the aim of}} this study was to delineate the roles of PTGER 1 and PTGER 2 receptors in mediating the effects of PGE 2 on steroidogenesis and cortisol metabolism in human granulosa–lutein cells. PGE 2 -stimulated concentration-dependent increases in both progesterone production and cAMP accumulation (by 1 · 9 ± 0 · 1 - and 18 · 7 ± 6 · 8 -fold respectively at 3000  nM PGE 2). While a selective PTGER 1 antagonist, SC 19220, could partially inhibit the steroidogenic response to PGE 2 (by 55 · 9 ± 4 · 1 % at 1000  nM PGE 2), co-treatment with AH 6809, a mixed PTGER 1 /PTGER 2 receptor antagonist, completely abolished the stimulation of progesterone synthesis at all tested concentrations of PGE 2 and suppressed the stimulation of cAMP accumulation. Both PGE 2 and <b>butaprost</b> (a preferential PTGER 2 receptor agonist) stimulated concentration-dependent increases in cortisol oxidation by 11 βHSD 1 (by 42 · 5 ± 3 · 1 and 40 · 0 ± 3 · 0 % respectively, at PGE 2 and <b>butaprost</b> concentrations of 1000  nM). Co-treatment with SC 19220 enhanced the ability of both PGE 2 and <b>butaprost</b> to stimulate 11 βHSD 1 activity (by 30 · 2 ± 0 · 2 and 30 · 5 ± 0 · 6 % respectively), whereas co-treatment with AH 6809 completely abolished the 11 βHSD 1 responses to PGE 2 and <b>butaprost.</b> These findings implicate the PTGER 2 receptor–cAMP signalling pathway in the stimulation of progesterone production and 11 βHSD 1 activity by PGE 2 in human granulosa–lutein cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{prostaglandin}} E 2 (PGE 2) G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), EP 2, plays {{important roles}} in mouse skin tumor development (Chun, K. S., Lao, H. C., Trempus, C. S., Okada, M., and Langenbach, R. (2009) Carcinogenesis 30, 1620 – 1627). Because keratinocyte proliferation is essential for skin tumor development, EP 2 -mediated signaling pathways that contribute to keratinocyte proliferation were investigated. A single topical application of the EP 2 agonist, <b>butaprost,</b> dose-dependently increased keratinocyte replication via activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and PKA signaling. Because GPCR-mediated activation of EGFR can involve {{the formation of a}} GPCR-β-arrestin-Src signaling complex, the possibility of a β-arrestin 1 -Src complex contributing to EP 2 -mediated signaling in keratinocytes was investigated. <b>Butaprost</b> induced β-arrestin 1 -Src complex formation and increased both Src and EGFR activation. A role for β-arrestin 1 in EP 2 -mediated Src and EGFR activation was demonstrated by the observation that β-arrestin 1 deficiency significantly reduced Src and EGFR activation. In agreement with a β-arrestin 1 -Src complex contributing to EGFR activation, Src and EGFR inhibition (PP 2 and AG 1478, respectively) indicated that Src was upstream of EGFR. <b>Butaprost</b> also induced the activation of Akt, ERK 1 / 2, and STAT 3, and both β-arrestin 1 deficiency and EGFR inhibition (AG 1478 or gefitinib) decreased their activation. In addition to β-arrestin 1 -dependent EGFR activation, <b>butaprost</b> increased PKA activation, as measured by phospho-GSK 3 β (p-GSK 3 β) and p-cAMP-response element-binding protein formation. PKA inhibition (H 89 or RP-adenosine- 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic monophosphorothioate (RP-cAMPS)) decreased butaprost-induced cAMP-response element-binding protein and ERK activation but did not affect EGFR activation, whereas β-arrestin 1 deficiency decreased EGFR activation but did not affect butaprost-induced PKA activation, thus indicating that they were independent EP 2 -mediated pathways. Therefore, the results indicate that EP 2 contributed to mouse keratinocyte proliferation by G protein-independent, β-arrestin 1 -dependent activation of EGFR and G protein-dependent activation of PKA...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the magnitude of the intraocular-pressure (IOP) -lowering response in monkeys to the nonselective prostaglandin (PG) F 2 a-isopropyl ester (ie) can be reproduced by combining other PG-subtype-selective compounds. IOP was lowered by approximately 25 % after 4 – 5 days of topical administration with latanoprost (FP agonist, 1. 5 μg, q. d.), bimatoprost (prostamide, whose metabolites have been shown to be FP agonists; 9 μg, q. d.), or travoprost (FP agonist, 1. 2 μg, q. d) or the EP 2 agonist, <b>butaprost</b> (25 μg, b. i. d.). The EP 1 agonist, 17 -phenyl trinor (PhT) PGE 2 (b. i. d.), and EP 3 agonist, sulprostone (b. i. d.), had no IOP-lowering effects. The addition of <b>butaprost,</b> sulprostone (10 μg), or 17 PhTPGE 2 (25 μg) to latanoprost did not lower IOP more than latanoprost alone. However, treatment with the combination of latanoprost, 17 PhTPGE 2, <b>butaprost,</b> and sulprostone produced a similar 50 – 55 % reduction in IOP, as did PGF 2 α-ie (b. i. d.). In conclusion, latanoprost, travoprost, and bimatoprost produce similar IOP-lowering responses in normotensive monkeys and are most efficacious when administered q. d. pm, compared to b. i. d. The combination of the FP, EP 1, EP 2, and EP 3 agonists used in this study was sufficient to lower IOP by the same magnitude as PGF 2 α-ie, suggesting that combining PG-subtype agonists may be a potent antiglaucoma strategy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{functional}} cDNA clone for {{the mouse}} prostaglandin (PG) E receptor EP 2 subtype was isolated from a mouse cDNA library. The mouse EP 2 receptor consists of 362 amino acid residues with seven putative transmembrane domains.

These findings have led us to examine whether the cloned receptor is the EP 4 subtype. AH 23848 B, a selective EP 4 antagonist, not only displaced the [3 H]PGE 2 binding to the cloned receptor but antagonized the PGE 2 -stimulated cAMP formation in the receptor. In contrast, EP 2 specific agonists, <b>butaprost</b> and 19 (R) OH-PGE 2 neither bound to the receptor nor stimulated the cAMP formation.

40|$|The use of nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} {{drugs is}} associated with a lower risk for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, in which overexpression of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) is frequently reported. Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), a COX- 2 -derived eicosanoid, is implicated in the promotion of cancer growth. However, the precise role of PGE 2 in the disease development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the effect of PGE 2 on the proliferation of cultured esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells (HKESC- 1). Results showed that HKESC- 1 cells expressed all four series of prostaglandin (EP) receptors, namely, EP 1 to EP 4 receptors. In this regard, PGE 2 and the EP 2 receptor agonist (±) - 15 -deoxy- 16 S-hydroxy- 17 -cyclobutyl PGE 1 methyl ester (<b>butaprost)</b> markedly increased HKESC- 1 cell proliferation. Moreover, the mitogenic effect of PGE 2 was significantly attenuated by RNA interference-mediated knockdown of the EP 2 receptor, indicating that this receptor mediated the mitogenic effect of PGE 2. In this connection, PGE 2 and <b>butaprost</b> induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 / 2 (Erk 1 / 2), whose down-regulation by RNA interference significantly attenuated PGE 2 -induced cell proliferation. In addition, PGE 2 and <b>butaprost</b> increased c-Fos expression and activator protein 1 (AP- 1) transcriptional activity, which were abolished by the mitogen-activated protein kinase/Erk kinase inhibitor 1, 4 -diamino- 2, 3 -dicyano- 1, 4 -bis(o-aminophenylmercapto) -butadiene ethanolate (U 0126). AP- 1 -binding inhibitor curcumin also partially reversed the mitogenic effect of PGE 2. Taken together, these data demonstrate {{for the first time that}} the EP 2 receptor mediates the mitogenic effect of PGE 2 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma via activation of the Erk/AP- 1 pathway. This study supports the growth-promoting action of PGE 2 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and the potential application of EP 2 receptor antagonists in the treatment of this disease.

40|$|Human lung {{mast cells}} (HLMC) express the Ca 2 +-activated K+ channel KCa 3. 1, which plays {{a crucial role}} in their {{migration}} to a variety of diverse chemotactic stimuli. KCa 3. 1 activation is attenuated by the β 2 -adrenoceptor and the adenosine A 2 A receptor through a Gs-coupled mechanism independent of cyclic AMP. Prostaglandin E 2 promotes degranulation and migration of mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells through the Gi-coupled EP 3 prostanoid receptor, and induces LTC 4 and cytokine secretion from human cord blood-derived mast cells. However, PGE 2 binding to the Gs-coupled EP 2 receptor on HLMC inhibits their degranulation. We show that EP 2 receptor engagement closes KCa 3. 1 in HLMC. The EP 2 receptor-specific agonist <b>butaprost</b> was more potent than PGE 2 in this respect, and the effects of both agonists were reversed by the EP 2 receptor antagonist AH 6809. <b>Butaprost</b> markedly inhibited HLMC migration induced by chemokine-rich airway smooth muscle-conditioned media. Interestingly, PGE 2 alone was chemotactic for HLMC at high concentrations (1 µM), but was a more potent chemoattractant for HLMC following EP 2 receptor blockade. Therefore, the Gs-coupled EP 2 receptor closes KCa 3. 1 in HLMC and attenuates both chemokine- and PGE 2 -dependent HLMC migration.

Gingival fibroblast expression of CCN 2 /CTGF {{in the presence of}} PGE 2 led us to compare the regulation of CCN 2 /CTGF expression in fibroblasts cultured from different tissues. Data demonstrate that the TGFβ 1 -induced expression of CCN 2 /CTGF in human lung and renal mesangial cells is inhibited by 10 nM PGE 2, whereas human gingival fibroblasts are resistant. Ten nM PGE 2 increases cAMP accumulation in lung but not gingival fibroblasts, which require 1 μM PGE 2 to elevate cAMP. Micromolar PGE 2 only slightly reduces the TGFβ 1 -stimulated CCN 2 /CTGF levels in gingival cells.

This study investigated the cross-talk that influences intracellular signaling and gene expression profiling in response to co-activation of the EP 2 and FP prostanoid receptors in Ishikawa cells stably expressing both receptors (FPEP 2 cells). In this study we show that in FPEP 2 cells, PGF alone does not alter adenosine 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production, but in combination with <b>Butaprost</b> enhances EP 2 receptor mediated cAMP release compared to treatment with <b>Butaprost</b> alone. PGF-mediated potentiation of cAMP release was abolished by antagonism of the FP receptor, inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) and inositol phosphate receptor (IP 3 R) whereas inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) had no effect. Moreover, inhibition of calcium effectors using calmodulin antagonist (W 7) or Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMK-II) inhibitor (KN- 93) abolished PGF potentiation of Butaprost-mediated cAMP release. Using siRNA molecules targeted against the adenylyl cyclase 3 (AC 3) isoform, we show that AC 3 is responsible for the cross-talk between the FP and EP 2 receptors. Using gene array studies we have identified a candidate gene, Spermidine/N 1 -acetyltransferase (SAT 1), which is regulated by this cAMP mediated cross-talk. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that co-activation of the FP and EP 2 receptors results in enhanced release of cAMP via FP receptor-Gαq-Ca 2 +-calmodulin pathway by activating calcium sensitive AC 3 isoform...|$|E

C 57 BL/ 6 J mice placed on a high-NaCl diet exhibited increased medullary COX 2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1 (mPGES 1) expression as determined by immunoblot and real-time PCR. Cytosolic prostaglandin E synthase and prostacyclin synthase were not induced by the high-salt diet. Immunofluorescence showed mPGES 1 in collecting ducts and interstitial cells. High salt increased renal medullary PGE 2 as determined by gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry. The effect of direct intramedullary PGE 2 infusion was examined in anesthetized uninephrectomized mice. Intramedullary PGE 2 infusion (10 ng/h) increased urine volume (from 3. 3 ± 0. 6 to 9. 5 ± 1. 6 μl/min) and urine sodium excretion (0. 11 ± 0. 02 to 0. 32 ± 0. 05 μeq/min).

We have previously demonstrated that PGE 2 down-regulates intercellular adhesion molecule-I (ICAM- 1) expression in interleukin-I 1 (IL-IB) -stimulated human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). In the present study, we investigated which COX {{was involved in}} down-regulation of ICAM- 1 expression by PGE 2 in IL-IB-stimulated HGF and which subtypes of EP receptors modulated the ICAM- 1 expression. NS- 398, a specific COX- 2 inhibitor, completely inhibited PGE 2 production by IL-lB-stimulated HGF, as did indomethacin, a COX- 1 /COX- 2 inhibitor. Northern blot analysis and immunocytochemical staining showed that mRNA and protein of COX- 2 were expressed in IL- 1 B-challenged HGF, but not in unstimulated HGF, and that the expression of mRNA and protein of COX- 1 was similar both in unstimulated and in stimulated cells. NS- 398 and indomethacin enhanced ICAM- 1 expression in IL- 113 -challenged HGF. EP 1, EP 2, and EP 4 receptor mRNA was expressed in HGF according to reverse-transcription/polymerase chain-reaction.

TP-receptors mediate contraction of HCCS and penile resistance arteries (HPRA), since the agonist of these receptors, U 46619, potently contracted HCCS (EC 50 8. 3 ± 2. 8 [*]nM) and HPRA (EC 50 6. 2 ± 2. 2 [*]nM), and the contractions produced by prostaglandin F 2 α at high concentrations (EC 50 6460 ± 3220 [*]nM in HCCS and 8900 ± 6700 [*]nM in HPRA) were inhibited by the selective TP-receptor antagonist, SQ 29548 (0. 02 [*]μM). EP-receptors are responsible for prostanoid-induced relaxant effects in HCCS because only prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1), prostaglandin E 2 and the EP 2 /EP 4 -receptor agonist, <b>butaprost,</b> produced consistent relaxation of this tissue (EC 50 93. 8 ± 31. 5, 16. 3 ± 3. 8 and 1820 ± 1284 [*]nM, respectively).

In summary, endogenous production of prostanoids may regulate penile smooth muscle contractility by way of specific receptors. TP-receptors mediate contraction in HCCS and HPRA, while the relaxant effects of prostanoids are mediated by EP 2 - and/or EP 4 -receptors in HCCS and by EP- and IP-receptors in HPRA...|$|E

However, other temporal events are likely to regulate such processes and as prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) is ubiquitous during inflammation this study tested the hypothesis that PGE 2 was capable of directly modulating cytokine-induced NK cell IFN-γ synthesis {{in the absence of}} other immune cells. Using homogenous NK cell lines to establish direct effects, PGE 2 (0 · 1 – 1 µm) was found to suppress NK cell IFN-γ synthesis and antagonized the potent synergistic IFN-γ-inducing effects of IL- 12 and IL- 18. The actions of PGE 2 were mimicked by synthetic PGE 2 analogues including misoprostol and <b>butaprost.</b> The selective EP 2 receptor agonist <b>butaprost,</b> but not the EP 1 /EP 3 agonist sulprostone, suppressed IFN-γ synthesis and exclusively competed with PGE 2 for receptor binding on NK cells. Further analysis showed that PGE 2 did not modulate IL- 12 receptor mRNA expression and the effects of PGE 2 could be mimicked by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3 -iosobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine. The absence of demonstrable receptor modulation coupled with the observed suppression of IFN-γ synthesis by both EP 2 receptor-selective agonists and IBMX suggest that PGE 2 acts directly on NK cells via EP 2 receptors with its downstream effects on cAMP metabolism. This conclusion is further supported by findings that PGE 2 and its analogues consistently elevated levels of cAMP in NK cells. The ability of PGE 2 to antagonize the potent inductive signal provided by the combination of IL- 12 and IL- 18 supports the concept that PGE 2 may {{play an important role in}} limiting innate inflammatory processes in vivo through direct suppression of NK cell IFN-γ synthesis...|$|E

We find that in cultured NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts, PGE 2 is able to induce transient expression of Period 1 messenger RNA and the following circadian oscillation of clock gene expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intraperitoneal administration of PGE 2 results in the phase shift of circadian gene expression in mouse peripheral tissues in a time-dependent manner. This phase shift is also induced by the EP 1 /EP 3 agonist sulprostone but not by the EP 2 agonist <b>butaprost.</b> The PGE 2 -induced phase shift is inhibited by the EP 1 antagonist SC- 51322.

40|$|The prostanoid receptor(s) that mediates {{inhibition}} of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα) generation from human peripheral blood monocytes was classified {{by use of}} naturally occurring and synthetic prostanoid agonists and antagonists. In human monocytes that were adherent to plastic, neither prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2), prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF 2 α) nor the stable prostacyclin and thromboxane mimetics, cicaprost and U- 46619, respectively, promoted the elaboration of TNFα-like immunoreactivity, as assessed with a specific ELISA, indicating the absence of excitatory prostanoid receptors on these cells. Exposure of human monocytes to LPS (3 [*]ng[*]ml− 1, ∼ EC 84) resulted in a time-dependent elaboration of TNFα which was suppressed in cells pretreated with prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1), PGE 2 and cicaprost. This effect was concentration-dependent with mean pIC 50 values of 7. 14, 7. 34 and 8. 00 for PGE 1, PGE 2 and cicaprost, respectively. PGD 2, PGF 2 α and U- 46619 failed to inhibit the generation of TNFα at concentrations up to 10 [*]μM. With respect to PGE 2, the EP-receptor agonists, 16, 16 -dimethyl PGE 2 (non-selective), misoprostol (EP 2 /EP 3 -selective), 11 -deoxy PGE 1 (EP 2 -selective) and <b>butaprost</b> (EP 2 -selective) were essentially full agonists as inhibitors of LPS-induced TNFα generation with mean pIC 50 values of 6. 21, 6. 02, 5. 67 and 5. 59, respectively. In contrast to the results obtained with <b>butaprost</b> and 11 -deoxy PGE 1, another EP 2 -selective agonist, AH 13205, inhibited TNFα generation by only 21 % at the highest concentration (10 [*]μM) examined. EP-receptor agonists which have selectivity for the EP 1 - (17 -phenyl-ω-trinor PGE 2) and EP 3 -receptor (MB 28, 767, sulprostone) were inactive or only weakly active as inhibitors of TNFα generation. Pretreatment of human monocytes with the TP/EP 4 -receptor antagonist, AH 23848 B, at 10, 30 and 100 [*]μM suppressed LPS-induced TNFα generation by 10 %, 28 % and 77 %, respectively, but failed to shift significantly {{the location of the}} PGE 2 concentration-response curves. Given that AH 13205 was a poor inhibitor of TNFα generation, studies were performed to determine if it was a partial agonist and whether it could antagonize the inhibitory effect of PGE 2. Pretreatment of human monocytes with 10 and 30 [*]μM AH 13205 inhibited the generation of TNFα by 31 % and 53 %, respectively, but failed to shift significantly the location of the PGE 2 concentration-response curves at either concentration examined. Since PGD 2 and 17 -phenyl-ω-trinor PGE 2 (EP 1 -agonist) did not suppress TNFα generation, the EP 1 /EP 2 /DP-receptor antagonist, AH 6809, was employed to assess if EP 2 -receptors mediated the inhibitory effect of PGE 2. Pretreatment of human monocytes with 10 [*]μM AH 6809 did not affect LPS-induced TNFα generation but produced a parallel 3. 5 fold rightwards shift of the PGE 2 concentration-response curve. Collectively, these data suggest that human peripheral blood monocytes express at least two distinct populations of inhibitory prostanoid receptors that mediate {{inhibition of}} LPS-induced TNFα generation. One of these probably represents IP receptors based upon the selectivity of cicaprost for this subtype. The other population has the pharmacology of EP-receptors, but the rank order of potency for a range of synthetic EP-receptor agonists was inconsistent with an interaction with any of the currently defined subtypes. Given the pharmacological behaviour of <b>butaprost,</b> AH 6809 and AH 23848 B in these cells, we propose that multiple (EP 2 - and/or EP 4 - and/or IP) or novel EP-receptors mediate the inhibitory effect of PGE 2 on TNFα generation...|$|E

Contrary to what was expected, we found that, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), PGE 1 inhibited proliferation, migration and capillary-like structure formation in Matrigel. By RT–PCR studies, the expression of the EP 2 and EP 3 subtypes of the PG receptor was detected in HUVECs. PGE 1 alone stimulated adenylate cyclase activity at micromolar concentrations, while at nanomolar concentrations potentiated the forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. 8 -Bromoadenosine- 3 ′: 5 ′-cyclic monophosphate (Br-cAMP) mimicked the inhibitory effect of PGE 1 on endothelial cell growth, motility and tube formation.

In other tissues, PGE 2 acts via {{specific}} PGE 2 receptor subtypes including EP 1, which modulates intracellular calcium (Ca 2 +i) and EP 2, which is coupled to cyclic AMP (cAMP) generation. We have therefore investigated the presence of functional EP 1 and EP 2 receptors using human granulosa-lutein (GL) cells. Reverse-transcription PCR revealed that GL cells expressed mRNA transcripts encoding both EP 1 and EP 2 receptors. When GL cells were challenged with ligands that can bind to both receptor subtypes (PGE 2 and 16, 16 dimethyl PGE 2) or exclusively to EP 2 (<b>butaprost),</b> both cAMP formation and progesterone synthesis were stimulated. Furthermore, the cAMP response to these agonists could be significantly blocked by an EP 1 / 2 antagonist AH 6809 but not by an EP 1 -selective antagonist SC 19220. Exposure of GL cells to 16, 16 -dm PGE 2 transiently raised Ca 2 +i levels, which could be prevented by both AH 6809 and SC 19220.

Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) is an endogenous membrane phospholipid metabolite that has important immunomodulatory effects on T cell function.

Hence, the hypothesis that PGE 2 may influence DN Treg cell proliferation and/or regulatory function was tested in this study. Our data indicate that PGE 2 acts via the EP 2 receptor on DN Treg cells to inhibit their proliferation, an effect reproduced by the EP 2 -specific agonist <b>butaprost</b> and abrogated by the EP 2 antagonist AH 6809.

However, the effects of EP 2 receptor agonists on trabecular meshwork (TM) alterations leading to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) are still unknown. Here, we evaluated whether EP 2 receptor activation exhibits protective functions on TM cell death induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We show that the EP 2 receptor agonist <b>butaprost</b> protects TM cell death mediated by the ER stress inducer tunicamycin through a cyclic AMP (cAMP) -dependent mechanism, but independent of the classical cAMP sensors, protein kinase A and exchange proteins activated by cAMP. The ER stress-induced intrinsic apoptosis inhibited by the EP 2 receptor agonist was correlated with a decreased accumulation of the cellular stress sensor p 53. In addition, p 53 down-regulation was associated with inhibition of its transcriptional activity, which led to decreased expression of the pro-apoptotic p 53 -upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). The stabilization of p 53 by nutlin- 3 a abolished butaprost-mediated cell death protection. In conclusion, we showed that EP 2 receptor activation protects against ER stress-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis through down-regulation of p 53.

NS- 398, a cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 -selective inhibitor, suppressed LPS-enhanced EP 2 R/EP 4 R expression, suggesting that COX- 2 -issued prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) modulates DC function through stimulation of specific EPR subtypes.
