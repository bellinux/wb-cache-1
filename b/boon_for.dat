5|$|That {{starting}} field position {{proved a}} <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> the Virginia Tech defense, which only allowed 200total {{yards in the}} game. Tech linebacker Vince Hall led the Hokies and all defensive players with 13tackles in the game. Tech recorded one interception during the game, courtesy of Brenden Hill, who also made threetackles. Georgia's offensive line, despite starting only six scholarship offensive linemen, allowed just twosacks to the Virginia Tech defense. Chris Ellis and Noland Burchette each earned a single sack, accounting for a loss of 15totalyards.|$|E
5|$|The Games were a major {{economic}} <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> the city which {{had fallen into}} its worst recession in 40 years following the collapse of both oil and grain prices in the mid-1980s. A report prepared for the city in January 1985 estimated the games would create 11,100 man-years of employment and generate C$450-million in salaries and wages. In its post-Games report, OCO'88 estimated the Olympics created C$1.4 billion in economic benefits across Canada during the 1980s, 70 percent within Alberta, {{as a result of}} capital spending, increased tourism and new sporting opportunities created by the facilities.|$|E
50|$|Varadamudra is a mudra, and it {{indicates}} a gesture {{by the hand}} and symbolizes dispensing of <b>boons.</b> <b>For</b> varadamudra, right hand is used. It is held out, with palm uppermost and the fingers pointing downwards. Varadamudra and abhayamudra are the most common of several other mudras seen on images and icons relating to Indian religions.|$|R
25|$|A {{complete}} {{right whale}} skeleton was discovered on the seamount in 2005. The skeleton had been mostly stripped of flesh {{when it was}} found, indicating that it had probably spent many years on the ocean bottom. Although it was not obvious from surrounding fauna, whale falls like this may be <b>boons</b> <b>for</b> organisms living in ordinarily resource-poor regions.|$|R
5000|$|Malayalapuzha Devi is {{believed}} to grant <b>boons</b> <b>for</b> extending prosperity to all the devotees. The goddess is worshiped for protecting the devotee from enemies, getting the unmarried girls married, obtaining job for the unemployed, and helping businesses flourish.

5|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a space {{telescope}} that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990 and remains in operation. Although {{not the first}} {{space telescope}}, Hubble {{is one of the}} largest and most versatile, and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> astronomy. The HST is named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, and is one of NASA's Great Observatories, along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope.|$|E

50|$|The Amirthalingeswarar in {{the temple}} is placed on a seat called Avudayar {{according}} to Saiva principles. It is a mobile {{one that can be}} removed and placed on the seat again. Men and women seeking <b>boons</b> <b>for</b> children take the Sivalinga, perform puja and walk around it for three times and place it back on the Avudayar. The Amirthalinga is in the southern entrance of the temple.|$|R
5000|$|But due to {{the advent}} of Kaliyan {{and because of the}} cruel nature of his <b>boons,</b> <b>for</b> the first time the supreme God or the 'God beyond Consciousness' (Ekan) incarnates in the world as Vaikundar and so all the God-heads were {{surrendered}} to Vaikundar and all the previous scriptures had lost their substances. And so for the Kaliyukam, Vaikundar was said to be the only worshippable God and hence, the theology of Ayyavazhi was channeled towards exclusivism.|$|R
25|$|Some {{commentators}} {{indicated that}} they believed both sides' criticism would prove ultimately impotent and that the negative publicity would prove a <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> the film's box office. Nonetheless, the film trilogy has not been continued, prompting actor Sam Elliott to blame censorship and the Catholic Church.|$|E
25|$|The {{opening of}} the Nathu La pass on 6 July 2006, {{connecting}} Lhasa, Tibet, to India, was billed as a <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> Sikkim's economy. Trade through the pass remains hampered by Sikkim's limited infrastructure and government restrictions in both India and China, though the volume of traded goods has been steadily increasing.|$|E
25|$|The {{valley is}} {{blessed with the}} good {{population}} of snow leopards, ibex, Himalayan Brown Bear, Musk Deer, Himalayan Blue Sheep etc. which serves as the <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> the wildlife lovers. There are two important protected areas {{in the region that}} are a home to snow leopard and its prey including the Pin Valley National Park and Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary. Surprisingly, due to ardent religious beliefs, people of Spiti do not hunt these wild animals.|$|E

25|$|Anchorage at Valletta was a <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> career officers, but the {{conditions}} for conscripted sailors, locked in the holds or engaged in hard work, were atrocious. The crew of Alexander Nevsky openly revolted and was promptly suppressed by Geiden. He court-martialled sixteen men for hard work in Siberia; in January–March 1828 they were locked on board the Azov and then sent back to Russia. Azovs own records bear only a slight hint of sailors' discontentment.|$|E
25|$|A great <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> {{the economy}} of the village was the {{building}} of the Kennels in 1836 for the Duke of Buccleuch's pack. The hunting season brought many visitors and this led to the building of the Buccleuch Arms Hotel. At this time the local smiddy showed good business sense by moving from the east end of the village to the present location at the west end, in order, we can suppose, to be nearer the Kennels which, at one time, stabled as many as fifty horses.|$|E
25|$|Upon victory, {{the gods}} {{retreated to the}} city of Yu-Shan to oversee from on high, and granted the Exalted the Creation-Ruling Mandate as a <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> their service to the new order. The {{surrendered}} Primordials were banished to/became the Hell known as Malfeas, the Demon City. Now they are half-remembered only as the Yozis: ill-understood and impersonal cosmic deities whose continued worship is reckoned among the highest of heresies. The slain Primordials are known as the Neverborn, quiescent monsters whose impossible ending resulted {{in the formation of the}} Underworld.|$|E

25|$|During the 2012 Republican {{primaries}} the Republican Party of Iowa {{partnered with}} various news {{organizations such as}} Fox News to bring a series of debates that were nationally televised, but directed toward voters in Iowa. This national attention is a potential political <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> a small Midwestern state and attracts attention politically to a state that may otherwise not receive such attention. The caucuses also give power to the party members in the electorate. In this the average GOP voter in Iowa can {{set the tone for}} the entire primary campaign, which gives local voters tremendous control over who the next president will be.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} to the 1911 premiere {{was nothing short of}} triumphant. The opera was a complete success with the public and was a great financial <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> the house; it is reported {{that at the time of}} the première, tickets were sold out almost immediately. The response from music critics was overall very positive, although some responded negatively to Strauss's use of waltzes, a music form practically unknown during the era when the story of the opera takes place. Despite this, the opera became one of the composer's most popular works during his lifetime and the opera remains a part of the standard repertoire today.|$|E
25|$|North Carolina {{was hard}} {{hit by the}} Great Depression, but the New Deal {{programs}} of Franklin D. Roosevelt for cotton and tobacco significantly helped the farmers. After World War II, the state's economy grew rapidly, highlighted by the growth of such cities as Charlotte, Raleigh, and Durham in the Piedmont. Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill form the Research Triangle, a major area of universities and advanced scientific and technical research. In the 1990s, Charlotte became a major regional and national banking center. Tourism {{has also been a}} <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> the North Carolina economy as people flock to the Outer Banks coastal area and the Appalachian Mountains anchored by Asheville.|$|E

25|$|In March 2014, The New York Times {{reported}} that economic fallout from Snowden's leaks {{had been a}} <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> foreign companies, {{to the detriment of}} U.S. firms. Daniel Castro, a senior analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, predicted that the United States cloud computing industry could lose $35 billion by 2016. Matthias Kunisch, a German software executive who switched from U.S. cloud computing providers to Deutsche Telekom, said that due to Snowden his customers thought American companies had connections to the NSA. Security analysts estimated that U.S. tech companies had since Snowden collectively spent millions and possibly billions of dollars adding state-of-the-art encryption features to consumer services and to the cables that link data centers.|$|E
25|$|CBC {{does not}} pay any rights fees to Rogers or the NHL; however, Rogers assumed {{responsibility}} for production and all advertising sales during the telecasts. CBC does not receive any advertising revenue, although Rogers agreed to include promotions for CBC programming in its Hockey Night telecasts on the network, and the corporation still receives some revenue from Rogers for its use of CBC-employed production staff and personalities during the games (such as producers Joel Darling and Sherali Najak), along with its rent of offices and Studio 41 of the Canadian Broadcasting Centre for both Hockey Night and Sportsnet's overall coverage. Hockey Night in Canada had been a financial <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> CBC Television, which by one estimate received half of its total advertising revenue from the broadcasts. In order to assign responsibility for {{the content of the}} telecasts, compliance with regulatory guidelines, and advertising to Rogers, the HNIC broadcasts are broadcast on a part-time television network owned by Rogers' Sportsnet subsidiary, which is affiliated with CBC's English-language television stations. A license for this arrangement was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in April 2015.|$|E
25|$|Albania {{entered an}} {{orbit around the}} Soviet Union, and in September 1948 Moscow stepped in to {{compensate}} for Albania's loss of Yugoslav aid. The shift {{proved to be a}} <b>boon</b> <b>for</b> Albania because Moscow had far more to offer than hard-strapped Belgrade. The fact that the Soviet Union had no common border with Albania also appealed to the Albanian regime because it made it more difficult for Moscow to exert pressure on Tirana. In November at the First Party Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor (APL), the former Albanian Communist Party renamed at Stalin's suggestion, Hoxha pinned the blame for the country's woes on Yugoslavia and Xoxe. Hoxha had Xoxe sacked as internal affairs minister in October, replacing him with Shehu. After a secret trial in May 1949, Xoxe was executed. The subsequent anti-Titoist purges in Albania brought the liquidation of 14 members of the party's 31 person Central Committee and 32 of the 109 People's Assembly deputies. Overall, the party expelled about 25% of its membership. Yugoslavia responded with a propaganda counterattack, canceled its treaty of friendship with Albania, and in 1950 withdrew its diplomatic mission from Tirana.|$|E
