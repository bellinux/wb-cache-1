50|$|At {{the rear}} of the CSBS is a large compass with a slip ring {{carrying}} a rotating compass rose known as the <b>bearing</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>bearing</b> <b>plate</b> has lines on it that are used to represent the wind direction during manual calculations.

50|$|The third {{method of}} {{determining}} the wind is {{used in conjunction with}} the wind gauge bar. The aircraft is flown on three different headings, typically 120 degrees apart, and the time for the aircraft to travel a certain distance was measured with the timing beads. The <b>bearing</b> <b>plate</b> was rotated to match the compass heading of each leg, and the cursor was moved along the bar to draw a line on the <b>bearing</b> <b>plate</b> along that direction. After three such measurements a small triangle was formed. The aircraft then turned onto the bomb line. Using the drift angle measured from the auxiliary drift bar, the compass was rotated to that drift angle, and the cursor moved so it lay above the center of the triangle. This indicated the direction and speed of the wind.|$|E

50|$|A {{torsion spring}} {{counterbalance}} system consists {{of one or}} two tightly wound up springs on a steel shaft with cable drums at both ends. The entire apparatus mounts on the header wall above the garage door and has three supports: a center <b>bearing</b> <b>plate</b> with a steel or nylon bearing and two end bearing plates at both ends. The springs themselves consist of the steel wire with a stationary cone at one end and a winding cone at the other end. The stationary cone is attached to the center <b>bearing</b> <b>plate.</b> The winding cone consists of holes every 90 degrees for winding the springs and two set screws to secure the springs to the shaft. Steel counterbalance cables run from the roller brackets at the bottom corners of the door to a notch in the cable drums. When the door is raised, the springs unwind and the stored tension lifts the door by turning the shaft, thus turning the cable drums, wrapping the cables around the grooves on the cable drums. When the door is lowered, the cables unwrap from the drums and the springs are rewound to full tension.|$|E

50|$|This {{model is}} the zenith in {{complexity}} for the dumaresq, and was created {{for use in the}} most modern Dreyer tables of WW-I, the Mark IV and IV*. The electrical dumaresq's special features were very particular to its use in the Dreyer FCTs in which it was fitted, sitting atop a range clock. Like the Mark VI*, it was helm-free, a gyro applied own course continuously, and a bearing clock tried to keep the <b>bearing</b> <b>plate</b> set appropriately. Its new wrinkle was an elaborate electrical device which would, when engaged, continuously and automatically apply the indicated range rate to its range clock and convert the indicated speed-across to a gunnery deflection at the present range. These special accoutrements were overtaking the inherent complexity of the dumaresqs themselves.|$|E

50|$|One is an {{adaptation}} of the method used with the Drift Sight. Prior to approaching the target, the bomb aimer would have the pilot turn onto the expected wind line, and dials in zero wind speed and due north wind direction, which points the drift bar straight forward. With the bar in this position, the bomb aimer uses the drift wires to tune out any sideways drift and thereby find the exact wind direction. The <b>bearing</b> <b>plate</b> is rotated to the compass heading and locked, thereby recording the wind direction for future reference. The pilot then turned 90 degrees to {{one side or the}} other, placing the wind directly {{off the side of the}} aircraft. The bomb aimer then rotated the milled head to the same 90 degrees. At this point the wind speed knob is adjusted, pushing the drift bar sideways until objects on the ground could be seen moving directly along the drift wires. The wind speed is now known and set, and the aircraft can then manoeuvre as it wants with only the milled head needing adjustment.|$|E
30|$|Actuator loads {{were applied}} through a roller {{assembly}} {{consisting of two}} 152  ×  305  ×  51  mm thick hardened steel <b>bearing</b> <b>plates</b> and two hardened steel rollers of 51  mm diameter and 305  mm in length. This ensured uniform and frictionless load transfer from actuators to the girder surface. The <b>bearing</b> <b>plates</b> and rollers were heat-treated to maximum possible hardness, to minimize local deformations. Lead sheets were used between the load <b>bearing</b> <b>plates</b> and girder surface to aid in uniform loading. The MTS “MultiFlex” System precisely controlled the applied loads and displacements through the actuators. Each girder was first loaded using Actuators B and C under a load-control mode {{at a rate of}} 9  KN/min. As soon as the slope of load versus displacement curve for girder being tested dropped, the actuator control-mode was switched to a displacement-control at a rate of 5  mm/h until shear failure occurred {{at either end of the}} girder. The displacement-control mode was essential in capturing the ductility or brittleness behavior of the girder failing in shear.|$|R

50|$|The ground {{supporting}} an adobe structure {{should be}} compressed, as {{the weight of}} adobe wall is significant and foundation settling may cause cracking of the wall. Footing depth is to below the ground frost level. The footing and stem wall are commonly 24 and 14 inches thick, respectively. Modern construction codes call {{for the use of}} reinforcing steel in the footing and stem wall. Adobe bricks are laid by course. Adobe walls usually never rise above two stories as they are load bearing and adobe has low structural strength. When creating window and door openings, a lintel is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above. Atop the last courses of brick, bond beams made of heavy wood beams or modern reinforced concrete are laid to provide a horizontal <b>bearing</b> <b>plate</b> for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral earthquake loads to shear walls more able to carry the forces. To protect the interior and exterior adobe walls, finishes such as mud plaster, whitewash or stucco can be applied. These protect the adobe wall from water damage, but need to be reapplied periodically. Alternatively, the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters that provide longer protection. Bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters.|$|E
