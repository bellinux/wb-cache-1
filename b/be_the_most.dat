The Sally Lightfoot crab <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> affected crustacean after the spill.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Benign tumors of {{the parotid}} gland {{comprise}} the majority of salivary gland tumors. OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical characteristics of parotid gland tumors submitted to surgical treatment by the same surgeon. METHODS: Retrospective study with 154 patients who had parotid gland tumors. Clinical and histological data, type of surgery, and complications were assessed and described. RESULTS: <b>The</b> main manifestation <b>was</b> a mass with a median evolution of 12 months for benign tumors and five months for malignant tumors. Ultrasonography <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> frequent complementary exam. Pleomorphic adenoma <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common of <b>the</b> benign tumors, and mucoepidermoid carcinoma <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> frequent malignant tumor.

5|$|Relationships between B.cuneata and {{the other}} members of B.subg. Isostylis still remain unclear. Though Mast's studies found B.cuneata to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> basal of the three species, a 2004 study of genetic {{divergence}} within the subgenus yielded both other possibilities: some analyses suggested B.ilicifolia as basal, while others suggested B.oligantha. Further complicating the situation is the southernmost population of B.cuneata, which has both genetic and phenetic affinities with B.oligantha located to the southeast. The origin of this population is unknown. It might have arisen through hybridisation, or it may be a transitional or even ancestral form. Finally, biogeographical factors suggest that B.ilicifolia would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> basal of the three species: it occurs in the High Rainfall Zone where relictual species are most common, whereas the others are restricted to the Transitional Rainfall Zone, where more recently evolved species are most common.|$|E
