5|$|At {{the end of}} the novel, Charles {{returns from}} Europe; he and Mary {{establish}} something of a life together, <b>but</b> <b>Mary</b> is unhealthy and can barely stand {{to be in the same}} room with her husband; the last few lines of the novel imply that she will die young.|$|E
5|$|Mary did {{not enjoy}} her {{retirement}} for long; Eleanor died in her arms in February 1558. The grief-stricken queen travelled to Charles to ask him for advice about her future. Charles {{told her that he}} wanted her to resume regency in the Netherlands, and promised a home and a large income, <b>but</b> <b>Mary</b> declined the offer. Her nephew Philip then urged her advisor to convince her to return. When Charles became ill in August, Mary accepted the offer and decided that she would become governor once again.|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>Mary's</b> {{blue eyes}} were alight with anger. [...] "Isn't it a clean thing now, Stephen?" [...] she was crying. [...] "Do you mean that you and I aren't clean now? Will you never understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} hope so, madam," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Hoggarty, very sarcastic. <b>But</b> <b>Mary's</b> speech and my aunt's were quite lost upon Gus; {{for he had}} instantly run to his hat, and I heard him tumbling downstairs.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>Mary's</b> anxiety {{on account}} of Halbert seemed more deeply rooted. She {{declined}} prosecuting the task {{in which they had}} been so pleasingly engaged, under the excuse of a headache; nor could Edward prevail upon her to resume it again that morning.|$|R
5|$|To {{escape a}} family who does not share her values, Mary befriends Ann, a local girl who educates her still further. Mary becomes quite {{attached}} to Ann {{who is in the}} grip of an unrequited love and does not reciprocate Mary's feelings.

5|$|While in {{his early}} teens, Tolkien had his first {{encounter}} with a constructed language, Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon. At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. Their interest in Animalic soon died away, <b>but</b> <b>Mary</b> and others, including Tolkien himself, invented {{a new and more}} complex language called Nevbosh. The next constructed language he came to work with, Naffarin, would be his own creation.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the last}} male {{member of the}} House of Árpád, Andrew was elected king {{after the death of}} King Ladislaus IV in 1290. He was the first Hungarian monarch to issue a {{coronation}} diploma confirming the privileges of the noblemen and the clergy. At least three pretenders—Albert of Austria, Mary of Hungary, and an adventurer—challenged his claim to the throne. Andrew expelled the adventurer from Hungary and forced Albert of Austria to conclude a peace within a year, <b>but</b> <b>Mary</b> of Hungary and her descendants did not renounce their claim. The Hungarian bishops and Andrew's maternal family from Venice were his principal supporters, but the leading Croatian and Slavonian lords were opposed to his rule.|$|E

50|$|Honywood died in Marks Hall, Essex in 1620. There was {{a plaque}} in Markshall church which {{recorded}} her pious life. The plaque {{said she was}} buried there, but in fact she was buried {{with her husband in}} Lenham.

5|$|Charles III of Naples {{landed in}} Dalmatia in September 1385. Sigismund of Luxemburg invaded Upper Hungary (now Slovakia), forcing {{the queen mother}} to give Mary in {{marriage}} to him in October. However, they could not prevent Charles from entering Buda. After Mary renounced the throne, Charles was crowned king on 31December 1385, but he was murdered at the instigation of Mary's mother in February 1386. Mary was restored, but the murdered king's supporters captured her and her mother on 25July. Queen Elizabeth was murdered in January 1387, <b>but</b> <b>Mary</b> was released on 4June 1387. Mary officially remained the co-ruler with Sigismund, who had meanwhile been crowned king, but her influence on the government was minimal. She and her premature son died after her horse threw her during a hunting trip.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1840s, Mary Shelley {{found herself}} {{the target of}} three {{separate}} blackmailers. In 1845, an Italian political exile called Gatteschi, whom she had met in Paris, threatened to publish letters she had sent him. A friend of her son's bribed a police chief into seizing Gatteschi's papers, including the letters, which were then destroyed. Shortly afterwards, Mary Shelley bought some letters written by herself and Percy Bysshe Shelley from a man calling himself G. Byron and posing as the illegitimate son of the late Lord Byron. Also in 1845, Percy Bysshe Shelley's cousin Thomas Medwin approached her claiming to have written a damaging biography of Percy Shelley. He said he would suppress it in return for £250, <b>but</b> <b>Mary</b> Shelley refused.|$|E
5|$|Mary Patricia Mohan {{was born}} at 2 Third Avenue, Fazakerley, Liverpool. After two years Mary's father met and married his second wife, Rose, while {{on a trip to}} Monaghan, in Ireland. Rose arrived in Liverpool with two {{children}} from a previous marriage, <b>but</b> <b>Mary,</b> who had until then been looking after the Mohan family, realised that Rose did not care much for domesticity or her new husband's children. After a year she chose to live with her aunts. In 1923, at the age of 14 years, Mary started work as a nurse trainee at the Smithdown Road Hospital, and then took a three-year training course at Walton Road Hospital in Rice Lane, Liverpool, eventually becoming a state registered nurse.|$|E

It comes true when she discovers her twin sister Mary was stolen as a baby, and now Mary has come to live with her. <b>But</b> <b>Mary’s</b> {{upbringing}} {{with the people who}} stole her has made her rough, bad-mannered and very difficult to get along with.|$|R
50|$|In {{the climax}} of the film, the Nutcracker appears to have been killed, <b>but</b> <b>Mary's</b> tears and {{declaration}} of love restore him to life and transforms him into a prince, his true form. The rats are all defeated and overthrown, <b>but</b> now <b>Mary</b> must reluctantly awaken from her dream. Before she's fully awake, N.C. promises that they'll meet again. After she does so, she goes to Uncle Albert's workshop, where she meets his new young neighbor, who is the exact image of the Nutcracker Prince and who asks to be called N.C. The two become close friends, and the last shot of the film shows them ice skating together.|$|R
30|$|Skilled writers {{eliminate}} text {{to diminish}} the amount of repetition (Severinson Eklundh & Kollberg, 2003) <b>but</b> <b>Mary’s</b> deletion apparently serves to avoid excessive lifting from the sources. Instead of paraphrasing, summarising or elaborating the main ideas from the sources, she presented the ideas with, arguably, inappropriate use of quotation. As a result, as commented by the first rater, the development of her text was impeded.|$|R
5|$|The Duke of York {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism in 1668 or 1669, <b>but</b> <b>Mary</b> and Anne {{were brought up}} as Anglicans, pursuant to the command of Charles II. They were moved to their own establishment at Richmond Palace, where they were raised by their governess Lady Frances Villiers, with only occasional visits to see their parents at St James's or their grandfather Lord Clarendon at Twickenham. Mary's education, from private tutors, was largely restricted to music, dance, drawing, French, and religious instruction. Her mother died in 1671, and her father remarried in 1673, taking as his second wife Mary of Modena, a Catholic who was only four years older than Mary.|$|E
5|$|The family's {{domestic}} {{peace was}} shattered when Hogg's stepdaughter Jane Rosalind became romantically involved with Henry Hunt, {{the son of}} Leigh Hunt. Hunt had no clear employment prospects, causing Thomas and Jane to doubt the wisdom of a union. Hogg was very gentle when discussing this with his stepdaughter, hoping to avoid treating her the way that Timothy Shelley had treated Percy Shelley years earlier, <b>but</b> <b>Mary</b> Shelley thought that Hogg took much too passive a stance. Thomas and Jane decided to send Jane Rosalind to France in an unsuccessful attempt to distract her, but she soon returned and married Hunt.|$|E
5|$|The film follows Ezra Greer, {{a middle-aged}} man who has worked hard since his youth. He cares deeply for his motherless daughter, Mary, {{but was unable to}} attend the annual {{commencement}} at her co-educational college. He awaits for her to return from college, <b>but</b> <b>Mary</b> leaves with her romantic interest, Jack Denbeigh. On promise of marriage and wealth, Mary is romanced and gives birth to a fatherless child. Without word from his daughter, Ezra resigns from his job and attempts to seek her out and finds a poor motherless child, Marie. With Ezra's money exhausted he seeks employment and finds it as the valet of Jack.|$|E

The ladies'-fingers and petticoat-tails those officers sent to Livvy, I ate them also! (Once on a time this would have amused MISS PHOEBE, but her sense of humour has gone. She is crying.) Phoebe, if you have such remorse you will weep yourself to death.|$|R
50|$|Abberline {{tries to}} save <b>Mary,</b> <b>but</b> arrives too late, and blames his {{superior}} for not helping him or Godley on the cases. Abberline does nothing <b>but</b> watch <b>Mary's</b> mutilated body being taken away. Abberline receives a mysterious letter, which he soon realizes is from <b>Mary,</b> <b>but</b> he {{decides not to}} look for her {{as a way to}} offer her protection, as the Freemasons may be watching his every move. Abberline decides to burn the letter, knowing that he can never have a normal life.|$|R

5|$|Later {{on in the}} day, Mary Margaret finds a dove in {{the forest}} trapped in some wire mesh. The town vet (Kwesi Ameyew) at the shelter where David works tells her the bird will be okay but only if she returns to her flock. David offers to help Mary Margaret return the dove but she declines. He follows her anyway {{and is able to}} save her from falling off a cliff. It starts to pour so the two take shelter in an empty cabin. David asks Mary Margaret what is wrong and she admits she still has {{feelings}} for him, and he is the reason she goes to Granny's at 7:15. David replies that he goes to Granny's to see her. They nearly kiss <b>but</b> <b>Mary</b> Margaret stops it because she knows about Kathryn's pregnancy test. David explains that his feelings for Kathryn are memories but his feelings for Mary Margaret are real. She says they have to forget each other.|$|E
5|$|Removing the {{original}} tablet {{to the victims}} of the East Ham Sewage Works accident had left an unsightly gap in {{the original}} row of tiles. In 1931, Mary Watts tracked down Fred Passenger, a former employee of DeMorgan who had, after the closure of the business, set up his own ceramics business using DeMorgan designs. Passenger was by this time working for a pottery business in Bushey Heath established by artist Ida Perrin, <b>but</b> <b>Mary</b> Watts persuaded him to produce a single panel in the style of DeMorgan to fit into the empty space. Herbert Maconoghu, a schoolboy who had died in 1882 attempting to rescue two friends from drowning, {{had been one of the}} names originally suggested by Watts, and Passenger produced a tablet to Maconoghu in the style of the original central row, which was installed in April 1931. Maconoghu was actually Herbert Moore McConaghey, the son of Matthew and Martha McConaghey, and he was born in Mynpoorie in Indian where Matthew was working as a settlement officer for the Imperial Civil Service.|$|E
5|$|Within the year, Edward {{caused a}} {{constitutional}} crisis by announcing {{his desire to}} marry his twice-divorced American mistress, Wallis Simpson. Mary disapproved of divorce, which was against {{the teaching of the}} Anglican church, and thought Simpson wholly unsuitable to be the wife of a king. After receiving advice from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Stanley Baldwin, as well as the Dominion governments, that he could not remain king and marry Simpson, Edward abdicated. Though loyal and supportive of her son, Mary could not comprehend why Edward would neglect his royal duties in favour of his personal feelings. Simpson had been presented formally to both King George V and Queen Mary at court, <b>but</b> <b>Mary</b> later refused to meet her either in public or privately. She saw it as her duty to provide moral support for her second son, the reserved and stammering Prince Albert, Duke of York, who ascended the throne on Edward's abdication, taking the name George VI. When Mary attended the coronation, she became the first British dowager queen to do so. Edward's abdication did not lessen her love for him, but she never wavered in her disapproval of his actions.|$|E

25|$|The {{marriage}} was tumultuous, and Buckley quickly moved out, <b>but</b> <b>Mary</b> soon became pregnant. After several months, Buckley found himself neither willing nor {{able to cope}} with marriage and impending fatherhood. From then on, he and Mary saw each other only sporadically. They divorced in October 1966, about a month before their son Jeffrey Scott was born.|$|E
25|$|After a few weeks, {{many of the}} Queen's English maids {{were sent}} away, <b>but</b> <b>Mary</b> was allowed to stay, {{probably}} {{due to the fact that}} her father was the new English ambassador to France. Even when Queen Mary left France after she was widowed on 1 January 1515, Mary remained behind at the court of Louis' son-in-law and daughter, FrancisI and Claude.|$|E
25|$|In 1844, {{he moved}} to Ohio and began working in the law office of Rufus P. Spalding. Edgerton also taught in an academy in Tallmadge, Ohio the same year.

During this time, Edgerton declared himself an Agnostic. He married Mary Wright (1827–1885) of Tallmadge on May 18, 1848, <b>but</b> <b>Mary</b> almost ended the relationship, because of Edgerton's religious views.|$|E
