5|$|The {{move by the}} Rus' {{army was}} {{detected}} by the Mongols, {{who were on the}} east side of the Dnieper River waiting for reinforcements from Jochi, Genghis Khan's eldest son, who was campaigning around the Aral Sea. Jochi, however, had <b>become</b> <b>ill,</b> which meant no reinforcements would be coming.|$|E
5|$|His selflessness and {{strength}} were exemplified {{during this period}} by the assistance that he gave to a fellow worker who had <b>become</b> <b>ill.</b> Johnson would carry two sacks of corn on each journey between the wharf and the grain warehouse, rather than the usual single sack, up an incline so steep that it was known as Labour-in-vain-hill. He gave the extra money he earned {{to the family of}} the sick man until he was able to return work.|$|E
5|$|It {{lasted for}} five months, from 12 February to 12 July 1691. The {{conclave}} became deadlocked after Catholic monarchs opposed {{the election of}} Gregorio Barbarigo, who {{some members of the}} College of Cardinals also viewed as too strict. The conclave only ended in the July when cardinals started to <b>become</b> <b>ill</b> from the heat, and after French cardinals agreed to vote for Pignatelli despite him coming from Spanish-controlled Naples.|$|E

5|$|King Stefan the First-Crowned, who had <b>become</b> <b>ill,</b> took monastic vows {{and died}} in 1227. Radoslav, the eldest son, became king; he was crowned at Žiča by his uncle, Archbishop Sava. Radoslav's younger brothers, Vladislav and Uroš I, {{received}} appanages. Sava II (Predislav) was appointed Bishop of Hum shortly thereafter, later serving as Archbishop of Serbia from 1263 to 1270. The Church and state was thus controlled by the same family, and the ties between the two continued.|$|E
5|$|By 1859, Rosalie Cadron-Jetté's {{health was}} {{worsening}} significantly. Information about the particular conditions she was afflicted with is contradictory. Testimony from Cadron-Jetté's family suggests that Cadron-Jetté had <b>become</b> <b>ill</b> {{when she was}} 36 years old and never fully recovered. Other sources suggest generalised edema, known {{at the time as}} dropsy, while still others diagnose her with chronic nephritis, known at the time as Bright's disease, which worsened over the following years. Symptoms observed in Cadron-Jetté by her contemporaries included difficulty breathing, almost constant coughing, fits of breathlessness while standing and at rest, and swollen legs displaying open sores.|$|E
5|$|When {{alerted to}} the {{possibility}} of Michael Farrar having been poisoned in the months before the fire, detectives investigated the origin of the castor beans that had led to police investigating the September domestic dispute. The label on the seed packets identified them as a product of the Earl May chain of stores. An officer found contact information for the Olathe, Kansas Earl May store in Green's address book. The detectives contacted nearby Earl May stores to find if any employees remembered selling castor beans, which are out of season in the fall. A clerk in Missouri recalled that in September a woman had ordered ten packets of the out-of-season seeds and explained that she needed them for schoolwork. The clerk gave a description of the buyer that corresponded to Green, and tentatively identified her in a photo line-up as the buyer. Register tapes in the store's records showed that a purchase price corresponding to ten packets of castor beans had been rung up on either September 20 or 22. No records were found in any Earl May store of earlier such purchases that would have corresponded to Farrar first having <b>become</b> <b>ill</b> earlier in the year.|$|E

50|$|In 1911 he <b>became</b> <b>ill</b> and {{was forced}} to move to warmer climates until he recovered. He decided to go to the south of Europe but then a visit to Australia seemed appropriate.

5|$|After his {{recovery}} Sérurier took command at Livorno (Leghorn) {{but he was}} thrilled to get the order {{to return to the}} army. On 27 December 1796 he resumed command of the Mantua siege corps, replacing Charles Edward Jennings de Kilmaine who had also <b>become</b> <b>ill.</b> The corps consisted of 10,000 men in two divisions under Thomas-Alexandre Dumas and Claude Dallemagne. On 14–15 January 1797 Bonaparte defeated József Alvinczi in the Battle of Rivoli, inflicting terrible losses on the Austrians. Meanwhile, a relief column under Giovanni Marchese di Provera reached the north side of Mantua and on 16 January there was a battle. The Mantua garrison launched a sortie led by Karl Philipp Sebottendorf that made progress at first but was beaten back by reinforcements under Claude Perrin Victor. At the same time, Sérurier and 1,500 troops at La Favorita Palace blocked Provera from joining the garrison. By noon Provera was hemmed in by French reinforcements and at 2:00 pm he surrendered to Sérurier with 7,000 men, 22 field guns, a pontoon train and a food convoy. Afterward, Sérurier got into a dispute with Dumas, who had commanded armies but was now a mere division commander. Angry that his contributions were not recognized, Dumas sent an abusive note to the army chief of staff Louis-Alexandre Berthier and was demoted by Bonaparte. On 30 January, Wurmser began negotiations with Sérurier for the capitulation of Mantua; this was signed on 2 February 1797 by the two generals. The articles permitted Wurmser, his staff, his generals, 700 soldiers and six artillery pieces to go free, but 16,324 men of the garrison became prisoners of war.|$|E

25|$|The {{progress}} of Japan's advance in Malaya {{and elsewhere in}} the Pacific now raised real fears that Fiji would be attacked in February. However, by this stage Cunningham had <b>become</b> <b>ill</b> with dysentery and was hospitalised. Later that month he was returned to New Zealand due to his poor health. Major General Owen Mead took over command of the Pacific Section, 2NZEF.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to {{asbestos}} in {{the form}} of fibers is always considered dangerous. Working with, or exposure to, material that is friable, or materials or works that could cause release of loose asbestos fibers, is considered high risk. However, in general, people who <b>become</b> <b>ill</b> from inhaling asbestos have been regularly exposed in a job where they worked directly with the material.|$|E

No Governor of Delaware had experienced such a difficult term of office, but Cannon remained steadfast in spite of it all.|$|E
25|$|On location, {{shooting}} {{conditions were}} often cold and wet, causing Vigo to <b>become</b> <b>ill</b> {{and develop a}} fever.

He worked until the film was almost complete and a rough cut had been made.|$|E
25|$|The kind of {{technology}} used in genetic engineering {{is also being}} developed to treat people with genetic disorders in an experimental medical technique called gene therapy. However, here the new gene is put in after the person has grown up and <b>become</b> <b>ill,</b> so any new gene is not inherited by their children. Gene therapy works by trying to replace the allele that causes the disease with an allele that works properly.|$|E

25|$|Chronic {{poisoning}} is long-term repeated or {{continuous exposure}} to a poison where symptoms do not occur immediately or after each exposure.
