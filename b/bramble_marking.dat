5000|$|A 1984 revival with a {{new book}} by <b>Mark</b> <b>Bramble</b> was {{directed}} by Tom O'Horgan, but shortly before opening, Joe Layton replaced O'Horgan. The dance choreography was by Lester Wilson. After 15 previews, it opened on November 11 at The Broadway Theatre.

[...] Tatum was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical. In his review in The New York Times, Frank Rich commented: [...] "The Three Musketeers is a good-natured attempt to jazz up Rudolf Friml's Dumas-inspired operetta ... much as the New York Shakespeare Festival retooled The Pirates of Penzance a few seasons ago. But this time the source material is many rungs below Gilbert and Sullivan - and the new accouterments add no wit, style, sexiness or show-biz dazzle. ... <b>Mark</b> <b>Bramble's...</b> idea of writing a musical book ... is to minimize the book. The baroque plot of The Three Musketeers is so frenetically and confusingly conveyed that no child is likely to understand who the Duke of Buckingham is, or why Cardinal Richelieu is such a pill, or why everyone is chasing after a diamond brooch throughout Act II. ... The title characters ... often seem like interchangeable stand-ins for the Three Stooges. ... Joe Layton has tried to give the show the illusion of excitement by staging it at a frantic pace and by sending the actors {{running up and down the}} aisles ... but everyone seems to be scurrying pointlessly about just to keep busy. After a while, the company begins to look like a road troupe of Camelot on amphetamines." ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{configuration}} of the ground offered us no protection. By lying flat on our faces between the guns we were screened from view by a straggling row of <b>brambles,</b> which <b>marked</b> {{the course of an}} obsolete fence; but the enemy's grape was sharper than his eyes, and it was poor consolation to know that his gunners could not see what they were doing, so long as they did it. The shock of our own pieces nearly deafened us, but in the brief intervals we could hear the battle roaring and stammering in the dark reaches of the forest to the right and left, where our other divisions were dashing themselves again and again into the smoking jungle. What would we not have given to join them in their brave, hopeless task! But to lie inglorious beneath showers of shrapnel darting divergent from the unassailable sky--meekly to be blown out of life by level gusts of grape--to clench our teeth and shrink helpless before big shot pushing noisily through the consenting air--this was horrible! [...] "Lie down, there!" [...] a captain would shout, and then get up himself to see that his order was obeyed. [...] "Captain, take cover, sir!" [...] the lieutenant-colonel would shriek, pacing {{up and down in the}} most exposed position that he could find.|$|R
