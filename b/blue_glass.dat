5|$|Cobalt {{has been}} used to color glass since the Bronze Age. The {{excavation}} of the Uluburun shipwreck yielded an ingot of <b>blue</b> <b>glass,</b> cast during the 14th century BC. <b>Blue</b> <b>glass</b> items from Egypt are colored with copper, iron, or cobalt. The oldest cobalt-colored glass is from the Eighteenth dynasty in Egypt (1550–1292 BC). The source of that cobalt is unknown.|$|E
5|$|After several redesigns, the feud was {{declared}} over, and {{construction on the}} Residences at The Ritz-Carlton began on May 2, 2006. The <b>blue</b> <b>glass</b> skyscraper opened to residents in January 2009. The Residences at The Ritz-Carlton features 270 condominiums and penthouses, which {{range in price from}} US$550,000 to US$12 million. The high-rise also features an underground parking garage, a fitness center, a pool, and a private garden and public plaza called Girard Park.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the marina, the Ocean Village resort features three residential towers, with <b>blue</b> <b>glass</b> balconies, that also have commercial space: Grand Ocean Plaza, Imperial Plaza, and Majestic Plaza. Construction of a new World Trade Center in Ocean Village was scheduled to begin in 2012. The development {{has a variety of}} restaurants, bars, and retail outlets, as well as executive office space. Leisure Island, on reclaimed land, has a business centre and casino, among other facilities.|$|E

25|$|Synthetic {{sapphire}}, or sapphire glass, or <b>blue</b> <b>glass</b> (as sapphires {{are blue}} in color) is both highly transparent to wavelengths of light between 150nm (UV) and 5500nm (IR) (the visible spectrum extends about 380nm to 750nm), and extraordinarily scratch-resistant.|$|E
25|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>glass</b> was {{manufactured}} in Mesopotamia and Egypt {{as early as}} 2500 BC, using the same copper ingredients as Egyptian blue pigment. They also added cobalt, which produced a deeper blue, the same blue produced in the Middle Ages in the stained glass windows of the cathedrals of Saint-Denis and Chartres.|$|E

25|$|The Treveri, a Gallic or Celtic tribe, {{inhabited}} {{the region for}} several hundred years until they were conquered by Julius Caesar in 54 BC. A Celtic necropolis from the 1st century was discovered in the early 1970s on the Juckelsboesch plateau between Mamer and Kehlen. A beautiful dark <b>blue</b> <b>glass</b> bowl was among the offerings found in the tombs.|$|E
25|$|The reconstructed baptistery {{follows the}} original, with the {{addition}} of a metal lining to prevent deterioration and a platform where witnesses may sit. The floor of the baptistery, the largest of any temple in the church, was replicated in red brick tile. A dome and chandelier are featured in the ceiling and art glass window is on the east end. The room has intricate crown moldings. The window moldings included framework for six-pointed stars made of red, white, and <b>blue</b> <b>glass</b> to replicate the originals.|$|E

25|$|In 669 CE, {{long after}} the fort was {{abandoned}} in the fourth century, King Egbert granted land to the priest Bassa to build Reculver church. Most of the church was pulled down in 1809 leaving two towers as navigational aids, and sea erosion has removed half of the fort. Anglo-Saxon finds include a large glass beaker with tears found at Broomfield in 1830, a fifth or sixth century wheel-made pottery bowl known as the Marshside Bowl found by the son of farmer Jack Harbour, and a large <b>blue</b> <b>glass</b> bead found near Reculver.|$|E
25|$|An {{outstanding}} {{example of}} the free-blowing technique is the Portland Vase, which is a cameo manufactured during the Roman period. An experiment {{was carried out by}} Gudenrath and Whitehouse with the aim of re-creating the Portland Vase. A full amount of <b>blue</b> <b>glass</b> required for the body of the vase was gathered {{on the end of the}} blowpipe and was subsequently dipped into a pot of hot white glass. Inflation occurred when the glassworker blew the molten glass into a sphere which was then stretched or elongated into a vase with a layer of white glass overlying the blue body.|$|E
25|$|The east-facing {{cross-arm}} of {{the church}} contains the altar, and also contains a half-round apse that is recognisable from outside. The apse contains a mullion which, like the two smaller windows next to the apse, is filled with colourful glass bricks. The red, green, yellow and <b>blue</b> <b>glass</b> bricks provide the only exterior light into the chancel, that is otherwise only lit through the opened doors of the iconostasis, or through it from the inner part {{of the church}}. North of the chancel, at the Northeast side of the building, is a narrow bell-gable with four bells that can be rung from outside using bell ropes.|$|E

Likewise, in the current study of big data which play the same role as the white paper being looked at, various {{statistical}} methods just serve as the <b>blue</b> <b>glasses.</b> That is, results obtained from big data often depend on the statistical methods in use, which may often defy reality. Here I suggest using physical ideas and methods to overcome this problem to the greatest extent. This suggestion is helpful to development and application of big data.

25|$|Clayton and Bell {{excelled in}} their use of colour. The {{designing}} of a stained glass window that “works” from a visual point of view is a more complex matter than simply drawing up a cartoon and painting the colours in. What works on paper does not necessarily work when it has the added element of light streaming through it. Some colours are notoriously difficult. <b>Blue</b> <b>glass,</b> frequently used for backgrounds, can create a halo effect that dominates the window. Red and blue together can create a jumping discordant pattern that is quite nasty to look at. Faces can bleach out completely. Green can simply turn black.|$|E
25|$|Glasses {{with lead}} oxide content first {{appeared}} in Mesopotamia, {{the birthplace of the}} glass industry. The earliest known example is a <b>blue</b> <b>glass</b> fragment from Nippur dated to 1400 BC containing 3.66% PbO. Glass is mentioned in clay tablets from the reign of Assurbanipal (668–631 BC), and a recipe for lead glaze appears in a Babylonian tablet of 1700 BC. A red sealing-wax cake found in the Burnt Palace at Nimrud, from the early 6th century BC, contains 10% PbO. These low values suggest that lead oxide may not have been consciously added, and was certainly not used as the primary fluxing agent in ancient glasses.|$|E
25|$|In the {{northern}} suburb of Maroussi, the upgraded main Olympic Complex (known by its Greek acronym OAKA) dominates the skyline. The {{area has been}} redeveloped according to a design by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, with steel arches, landscaped gardens, fountains, futuristic glass, and a landmark new <b>blue</b> <b>glass</b> roof which {{was added to the}} main stadium. A second Olympic complex, next to the sea at the beach of Palaio Faliro, also features modern stadia, shops and an elevated esplanade. Work is underway to transform the grounds of the old Athens Airport – named Elliniko – in the southern suburbs, into one of the largest landscaped parks in Europe, to be named the Hellenikon Metropolitan Park.|$|E

40|$|Deep <b>blue</b> <b>glasses</b> {{coloured}} by octahedral Fe 2 + cations {{are often}} reported as textbook examples of blue pigmentation. However, despite {{the possibility of}} laboratory synthesis under reducing conditions, to date there are no well-reported occurrences of their production and use in the past. A thorough historical, ethnographic, mineralogical, and chemico-physical investigation of the ‘smaltini di calcara’ from several baroque churches in Palermo, Sicily, has revealed that the blue enamels widely used for altar decorations in the 17 th and 18 th centuries are actually a unique case of ancient <b>blue</b> <b>glasses</b> pigmented by divalent iron cations in distorted octahedral coordination. This mixed-alkali glass was accidentally produced under severely reducing conditions in the local kilns during production of lime...|$|R
25|$|Chemical {{analysis}} of the chamber floor has suggested {{the presence of a}} body in the south-western corner. The goods found included fragments of a <b>blue</b> <b>glass</b> cup with a trailed decoration, similar to the recent find from the Prittlewell tomb in Essex. There were two gilt-bronze discs with animal interlace ornament, a bronze brooch, a silver buckle, and a gold-coated stud from a buckle. Four objects had a special kinship with the Mound 1 finds: the tip of a sword blade showed elaborate pattern welding; silver-gilt drinking horn-mounts (struck from the same dies as those in Mound 1); and the similarity of two fragments of dragon-like mounts or plaques. Although the rituals were not identical, the association of the contents of the grave shows a connection between the two burials.|$|E
25|$|In 1958 {{the land}} for the temple had to be bought {{in the name of}} three African Ugandan Bahá'ís rather than an {{institution}} directly foreign or domestic. These Bahá'ís were Joseph Mbogo, Erisha Kiwanuka and Max Kanyerezi who held the land in trust. The Bahá'í House of Worship in Uganda, named as the Mother Temple of Africa, is situated on Kikaya Hill on the outskirts of Kampala. At the ceremony of the laying of the foundation stone in 1958 Hands of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khanum and Músá Banání presented material gifts for the building - some soil from the inner-most Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh and the fortress of Maku where the Báb was imprisoned. The building was designed by Mason Remey and the green dome is made of fixed mosaic tiles from Italy, the lower roof tiles are from Belgium, and the colored glass in the wall panels was brought from Germany. Nine massive columns, each two feet in diameter, support the great dome, itself forty-four feet in diameter at its base; while the two roofs are supported by two sets of twenty seven slightly smaller columns. The overall height is 127ft., the internal diameter of the building is eighty four feet and the seating capacity is over 600. The inside of the dome is painted a pale blue; the rotunda, into which are set nine enormous windows and fifty-four small windows, all filled with green, amber and pale <b>blue</b> <b>glass,</b> is painted a brilliant white, while the columns and the lower walls are painted a very pale green. All this lends itself to an effect of lightness and airiness which is intensified by the large green and amber glass-filled grilles which stand {{on either side of the}} huge mvule doors.|$|E
