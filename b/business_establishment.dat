25|$|The Syrian army killed 28 {{people by}} the late afternoon, {{including}} 9 in Hama. At the same time, the conflict has started moving into the two largest cities (Damascus and Aleppo) that the government claimed was being dominated by the silent majority, which wanted stability, not government change. In both places {{there has been a}} revival of the protest movement in its peaceful dimension. Shopkeepers across the capital staged a general strike and in several Aleppo commercial districts mounted a similar but smaller protest.

25|$|There are varying rules {{within these}} categories, {{for example the}} amount possessed, the role played in the {{transaction}} and {{the intent of the}} goods. Regarding coffee shops, the line between law and practice thins. A coffee shop is a heavily controlled <b>business</b> <b>establishment</b> where individuals can purchase a personal dose of soft drugs in the form of joints, pastry, drinks and packages. In theory illegal, these shops must abide by governmental and local regulations, as well as meet the AHOJ-G criteria, an acronym for: No Advertising, Hard drugs, Nuisance of any kind, Jongeren (minors under 18), and a limit of five grams per transaction. Additionally, the maximum stock at any time is five hundred grams. Local governments may impose additional rules, such as closing times, zoning (coffee shops may not be close to schools), and parking restrictions. The rationale behind coffee shops is to keep citizens away from the hard drugs scene, bringing them to a safe, social, and regulated environment.|$|E
500|$|Communications scholar Arthur Kroker {{argues that}} Innis's {{study of the}} Canadian Pacific Railway was only the first in which he {{attempted}} to demonstrate that [...] "technology is not something external to Canadian being; but on the contrary, is the necessary condition and lasting consequence of Canadian existence". [...] It also reflected Innis's lifelong interest {{in the exercise of}} economic and political power. His CPR history ends, for example, with a recounting of Western grievances against economic policies, such as high freight rates and the steep import tariffs designed to protect fledgling Canadian manufacturers. Westerners complained that this National Policy funnelled money from Prairie farmers into the pockets of the Eastern <b>business</b> <b>establishment.</b> [...] "Western Canada", Innis wrote, [...] "has paid for the development of Canadian nationality, and it would appear that it must continue to pay. The acquisitiveness of Eastern Canada shows little sign of abatement." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{lawyer for}} the UGG, Brownlee began to sympathize with the {{prevailing}} farmers' view that the eastern Canadian <b>business</b> <b>establishment</b> was hostile to their interests (for example, when the UGG wanted to sell twine, no manufacturer would supply it). [...] He recommended that the UGG reduce farmers' reliance on the eastern establishment by expanding its operations into insurance, investment, and real estate. [...] The result was the United Grain Growers Securities Ltd. [...] He also helped the UGG quietly sell the stock it held in the Home Bank of Canada when UGG directors began to doubt the bank's soundness; this subtlety was considered essential, as the directors were concerned that airing their doubts publicly would make the bank's failure a self-fulfilling prophecy. [...] When UGG Assistant General Manager J. R. Murray found an interested buyer, Brownlee advised Murray against insisting on an intricate written sales contract for fear that the buyer would sense the directors' concerns. [...] His advice was heeded, and the sale was concluded December 29, 1919. [...] The bank failed less than four years later.|$|E

500|$|Indians criticised their {{political}} leaders after the attacks, saying that their ineptness was partly responsible. The Times of India commented on its front page that [...] "Our politicians fiddle as innocents die." [...] Political reactions in Mumbai and India included {{a range of}} resignations and political changes, including the resignations of Minister for Home Affairs Shivraj Patil, Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and deputy chief minister R. R. Patil for controversial reactions to the attack including taking the former's son and Bollywood director Ram Gopal Verma to tour the damaged Taj Hotel and the latters remarks that the attacks were {{not a big deal}} in such a large city. Prominent Muslim personalities such as Bollywood actor Aamir Khan appealed to their community members in the country to observe Eid al-Adha as a day of mourning on 9 December. The <b>business</b> <b>establishment</b> also reacted, with changes to transport, and requests for an increase in self-defence capabilities. The attacks also triggered a chain of citizens' movements across India such as the India Today Group's [...] "War Against Terror" [...] campaign. There were vigils held across all of India with candles and placards commemorating the victims of the attacks. The NSG commandos based in Delhi also met criticism for taking 10 hours to reach the 3 sites under attack.|$|E

2500|$|The Rhodesian Front's {{victory in}} the 1962 general {{election}} and the subsequent UDI were in the populist tradition of Rhodesian politics. The early history of Rhodesian politics was very much one of electoral uprisings by miners, industrial workers and farmers against the big <b>business</b> <b>establishment</b> that dominated the colony. The election of the Reform Party government led by Godfrey Huggins in 1933 {{had a great deal}} in common with the RF win in 1962. It has been argued that the racial dimension of UDI was an incidental thing. Economic recessions in the early 1930s and the early 1960s had both produced the election of populist governments committed to securing standards of living for working people (albeit, the immediate concern was for working white people). It is significant that in the 1962 election, the RF recruited a slate of black candidates to contest the district (essentially B roll) seats. Those black RF candidates obtained little support from the B roll electorate and none were elected.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the center}} of the NIRA was the National Recovery Administration (NRA), headed by former General Hugh S. Johnson, who had been a senior {{economic}} official in World War I. Johnson called on every <b>business</b> <b>establishment</b> in the nation to accept a stopgap [...] "blanket code": a minimum wage of between 20 and 45 cents per hour, a maximum workweek of 35–45 hours, and the abolition of child labor. Johnson and Roosevelt contended that the [...] "blanket code" [...] would raise consumer purchasing power and increase employment. To mobilize political support for the NRA, Johnson launched the [...] "NRA Blue Eagle" [...] publicity campaign to boost what he called [...] "industrial self-government". The NRA brought together leaders in each industry to design specific sets of codes for that industry; the most important provisions were anti-deflationary floors below which no company would lower prices or wages, and agreements on maintaining employment and production. In a remarkably short time, the NRA announced agreements from almost every major industry in the nation. By March 1934, industrial production was 45% higher than in March 1933.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the course}} of the 1970s, the shift to the {{classical}} 6-string guitar took place, and now, a Russian guitar is a rare bird with the bards. In the same period, the movement of KSP (Kluby Samodeyatelnoy Pesni – amateur song fan clubs) emerged, providing the bards with highly educated audience, and up {{to the end of the}} 1980s being their key promotion engine. [...] Bards were rarely permitted to record their music, partly given the political nature of many songs, partly due to their vague status in the strictly organised state-supported show <b>business</b> <b>establishment</b> of the USSR. As a result, bard tunes usually made their way around as folk lore, from mouth to mouth, or via the copying of amateur recordings (sometimes referred as magnitizdat) made at concerts, particularly those songs that were of political nature. Bard poetry differs from other poetry mainly in the fact that it is sung along with a simple guitar melody as opposed to being spoken. Another difference is that this form of poetry focuses less on style and more on meaning. This means that fewer stylistic devices are used, and the poetry often takes the form of narrative. What separates bard poetry from other songs is the fact that the music is far less important than the lyrics; chord progressions are often very simple and tend to repeat from one bard song to another. On the other hand, in the USSR the chief bard supporter was the state Union of Composers, and the main bard hater was the state Union of Writers. A far more obvious difference was the commerce-free nature of the genre: songs were written to be sung and not to be sold. The similar genre dominated by singers-songwriters is known as sung poetry in other Post-Soviet countries.|$|E
