Below is a list of unmade serials which were submitted by recognised professional writers and the BBC had intended to produce, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> reason or another were not made. Many have since been the subject of a feature in Doctor Who Magazine, or other professional periodicals or books devoted to the television show.|$|E

25|$|Clarke {{failed to}} win a Stanley Cup over the 22 seasons he was a general manager with Philadelphia, Minnesota, and Florida. During his 19 seasons as Flyers manager over two stints, the Flyers reached the Stanley Cup finals three times and amassed a regular season record of 714–443–199, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> reason or another always came up short of a Cup title. Clarke's Flyers in 1985 and 1987 were {{considered}} underdogs to the powerhouse Edmonton Oilers, as were his North Stars to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1991. In his second tenure as Flyers manager, the team lost in the postseason, frequently to lower-seeded teams. While goaltending was a strength during his first tenure with two Vezina Trophy winners between the pipes (Pelle Lindbergh and Ron Hextall), only Hextall in 1995, a combination of Hextall and Garth Snow in 1997, Brian Boucher in 2000, and Robert Esche in 2004 got the Flyers past {{the second round of}} the playoffs during his second stint. By contrast the New Jersey Devils, their Atlantic Division rivals, were stable in net with Martin Brodeur and beat the Flyers in the Conference Finals en route to Stanley Cups in 1995 and 2000.|$|E

25|$|In 2006 One Day Cricket in England {{was given}} a major revamp by the ECB. This led to quite a few changes for day/night cricket in England. For the first time Day/Night matches were played in the than known C Trophy {{although}} as in the Twenty20 Cup matches were limited to the counties who owned paramount floodlights who were joined by Hampshire in becoming the fifth county to install paramount floodlights at the Rose Bowl. Also 2006 saw {{the launch of the}} NatWest Pro40 League which replaced the National League however under the new format the counties only played other once in their divisions as opposed to home and away. This meant that the number of day/night matches played in the competition was reduced because the counties had fewer home matches to play with. The story stayed the same for 2007 <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> thing. On 10 September 2007, ten years after the first day/night matches were played in England Lord's finally got to stage its first game under floodlights with a match between Middlesex and Derbyshire, a match which Middlesex won by 4 wickets.|$|E

500|$|As the {{postcard}} effort was reaching its peak, tabloid newspapers {{speculated that the}} Labour Party wanted to put Hewson up for the Irish presidential election of 2004, with the Daily Mirror quoting an unnamed party insider as saying, [...] "She's a mother of four but she has always had world issues at heart and she'd make the perfect candidate." [...] (Labour had succeeded with its candidate Mary Robinson in the 1990 election but came in fourth with Roche in the 1997 election.) Hewson stated {{that she had not}} been approached, and that [...] "It's not a serious proposition. It would obviously be a huge honour if I was asked to take on such a huge task, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> thing I'm not sure I'm qualified, and for another I've got four small kids to bring up first." [...] She also expressed contentment with incumbent President Mary McAleese staying for another term. She jokingly added that she could not see Bono agreeing to live in a smaller house. Hewson received a media mention two years later as a possible Social Democratic and Labour Party candidate in the 2004 European Parliament elections after John Hume had stood down. [...] The notion of her running for Irish president came up again in 2008 in conjunction with the 2011 election; columnist Fiona Looney wrote in the Daily Mail that while [...] "she is certainly a decent and smart woman", the position was better held by someone with a stronger background and more diplomatic experience. Hewson demurred once more, saying she did not speak the Irish language well enough, this time adding humorously that she could not see her husband being willing to walk behind her at events. The candidate that Labour did put up, Michael D. Higgins, won the post. Notwithstanding this speculation, Hewson generally shies away from political comments in the media.|$|E
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. <b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in the bowels of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|E

After playing in just one game for the Bears, Elmer Layden, the NFL's commissioner, barred him from further participation in the league because of his AAFC contract. Layden said the NFL's policy [...] "is not to permit players who have signed alleged player contracts with an unrecognized league to play football in the National Football League when it is such player's intention to play <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> year".|$|E

2500|$|The {{church is}} reached by {{walking through the}} grounds of Manor Farm; {{it is common for}} ancient Sussex churches to stand close to farms, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> to stand in a {{farmyard}} is unusual. [...] Standing outside the approach to the church is a [...] "magnificent" [...] granary apparently dating from the 17th century (one source attributes it to the late Elizabethan or early Stuart period, and others claim a date of 1600). [...] The hipped-roofed building is constructed of red brick with timber framing. [...] It stands on staddle stones—mushroom-shaped supports that lift the structure clear of the ground as a safeguard against damp and vermin. [...] Some restoration has been carried out. [...] Originally, {{it was part of the}} neighbouring Manor Farm—"one of the best farmhouses in this part of Sussex" [...] according to Nikolaus Pevsner—but since the 1970s it has been used for various purposes by St George's Church.|$|E

[...] He ordered a clinometer, and on 11 July wrote to tell Henslow that it had arrived and he had tried it out in his bedroom.
