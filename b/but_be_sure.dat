It was included on Beyoncé's 2009 remix album with videography, Above and Beyoncé. Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News described the video as a [...] "meaningful one—and {{it comes with}} a twist that requires repeat viewing". She noted that if the video did not exist, she would not have seen the tomboy side of Beyoncé. A writer for Rap-Up commented, [...] "Beyoncé delivers one of the year's best videos with the black and white clip." [...] Jennifer Cady of E! Online praised the video, writing that it has a [...] "serious melodramatic storyline". She further noted that it was [...] "slow and everyone overacts, <b>but</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> to catch the end where a major twist will probably change your outlook on the dynamics of male–female relationships forever".|$|E
500|$|Eleanor {{dismissed}} Bamie's criticisms {{by referring}} to her as an [...] "aged woman." [...] Bamie and Eleanor eventually reconciled, and {{in an article in}} the Ladies Home Journal, [...] "How to Take Criticism," [...] Eleanor referred to her, saying, [...] "I can honestly say that I hate no one, and perhaps the best advice I can give to anyone who suffers from criticism and yet must be in the public eye, would be contained in the words of my aunt, Mrs. William Sheffield Cowles. She was President Theodore Roosevelt's sister and the aunt to whom many of the young people in the family went for advice. I had asked her whether I should do something which at that time would have caused a great deal of criticism, and her answer was: 'Do not be bothered by what people say as long as you are sure that you are doing what seems right to you, <b>but</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that you face yourself honestly.'" [...] Theodore's elder daughter Alice also broke with Eleanor over her campaign. Alice and Eleanor reconciled after Eleanor wrote Alice a comforting letter upon the death of Alice's daughter, Paulina Longworth.|$|E
