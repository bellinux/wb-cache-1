5|$|A {{variety of}} psychoactive {{drugs and alcohol}} have notable effects on consciousness. These range from a simple dulling of {{awareness}} produced by sedatives, to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by stimulants, cannabis, empathogens–entactogens such as MDMA ("Ecstasy"), or most notably by the class of drugs known as psychedelics. LSD, mescaline, psilocybin, Dimethyltryptamine, and others in this group can produce major distortions of perception, including hallucinations; some users even describe their drug-induced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality. The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced <b>by</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> alcohol, but there is substantial evidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin play an essential role.|$|E
5|$|As {{the game}} is played, each PC changes over time and {{generally}} increases in capability. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills and wealth, and may even alter their alignment or gain additional character classes. The key way characters progress is by earning experience points (XP), which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a level, which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills. XP can be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or <b>by</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> certain magical powers that come with an XP cost.|$|E

5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce {{the temperature of the}} built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished <b>by</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a garden hose, soaker hose, sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E

Woodpeckers consume beetles that burrow into trees, removing as many as 85 percent of emerald ash borer larvae from individual ash trees.|$|E
5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science {{proved the}} unity of all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., all members of a species are {{connected}} genetically.

However, he was not sure what should be done with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E

5|$|In such studies, and {{in general}} Latter Day Saint parlance, the -suffixed terms Josephite and Brighamite {{have been used for}} the Missouri-based Community of Christ and the Utah-based LDS Church respectively; these terms have {{sometimes}} been used to distinguish groups of denominations as well. Those denominations within each group share a common ancestry and basic beliefs that are different from groups sharing other provenances. The present article, in a similar fashion, distinguishes among groups of denominations <b>by</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> commonly understood names such as Mormon fundamentalist or else by short descriptions that often reference a founder of the first church within a factional group–for example, Joseph Smith III in reference to Community of Christ as well as various churches and factions that trace their origin to it.|$|E

However, {{the accuracy of the}} measurements depended on the uniformity of the magnetic field, and Ramsey found that it was difficult to create sufficiently uniform magnetic fields. He developed the separated oscillatory field method in 1949 as a means of achieving the accuracy he wanted.|$|E
5|$|Several {{setbacks}} {{plagued the}} design process. The mine {{in particular was}} delayed several times from its expected completion from 1771 to 1776. Piloting Turtle, moreover, required great physical stamina and coordination. The operator would have to adjust the bilge {{in order to keep}} from sinking while providing his own propulsion <b>by</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a crank, which worked a propeller located {{on the front of the}} submarine, and direction <b>by</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a lever that would operate and direct a rudder in the back. The cabin also reportedly held air for only thirty minutes of use. Thereafter, the operator would have to surface and replenish the air through a ventilator. Obviously, training would be needed in order to ensure the project's success due to the complex nature of the machine. “The boat was moved from Ezra’s farm on the Westbrook Road to what is now Ayer’s Point in Old Saybrook on the Connecticut River,” writes historian Lincoln Diamant. Bushnell had a Yale connection here that allowed him to run trials in secrecy. Bushnell did the initial testing of his submarine here, choosing his brother, Ezra, as the pilot. Despite Bushnell's insistence on secrecy surrounding his work, news of it quickly made its way to the British, abetted by a Loyalist spy working for New York Congressman James Duane.|$|E

It was found that the transiting object did not produce a color, an aspect that is characteristic of stars. This suggested even further that KOI 072.02 was a planet. In addition, the IRAC instrument found no difference in the transit signal when comparing the star's light curve in the infrared and in visible light; stars that are aligned with Kepler-10 might appear visibly similar, but would appear different in the infrared.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} campaigning abroad by Rome, and the rewarding {{of soldiers}} with plunder from those campaigns, {{led to the}} trend of soldiers becoming increasingly loyal to their commanders {{rather than to the}} state, and a willingness to follow their generals in battle against the state. Rome was plagued by several slave uprisings during this period, in part because in the past century vast tracts of land had been given to veterans who farmed <b>by</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> slaves and who came to greatly outnumber their Roman masters. In the last century BC, at least twelve civil wars and rebellions occurred.
