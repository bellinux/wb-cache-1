40|$|Spontaneous {{abortion}} (SAb) is {{the most}} common complication of early pregnancy. Numerous risk factors are associated with an increased risk of pregnancy loss such as: <b>Blighted</b> ovum. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the frequency of balanced chromosomal translocations in couples with a history of recurrent spontaneous abortions and ultrasound diagnosed <b>blighted</b> ovum. Sixty Eight couples with the history of spontaneous abortion (diagnosed <b>blighted</b> ovum) were selected and introduced into this survey during 2007 - 2012 at Medical Genetics department of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. Giemsa banding technique was used to search for chromosomal balanced translocations. Demographic assessment has not shown any age difference between <b>blighted</b> ovum suffering couples and general population. Consanguineous marriages in <b>blighted</b> ovum suffering couples was significantly higher (P value < 0. 001) than non-consanguineous marriages (68. 5 % versus 31. 5 %), while in general population 62 % of were non-consanguineous. The incidences of balanced chromosomal rearrangements as well as the rate of chromosome 9 inversion were 8. 3 percent each, in non-consanguineous <b>Blighted</b> ovum suffering couples and the remaining (83. 4 %) showed normal karyotypes. There was no chromosome 9 inversion in consanguineous <b>blighted</b> ovum suffering couples and the incidence of balanced chromosomal rearrangements was 2. 3 %. With regard to relatively low incidence of balanced chromosomal rearrangements in consanguineous couples with <b>blighted</b> ovum, it would be reasonable to sugges...|$|R
5|$|One of six {{predetermined}} origin stories {{begins the}} game, {{depending on the}} player character's race and class. Each story ends with the player being introduced to and leaving with Duncan, the commander of Ferelden's Grey Wardens {{who is trying to}} find new recruits, selecting the player as a potential candidate. The two journey to a fortress in southern Ferelden called Ostagar. There, they join Cailan, the King of Ferelden, and his father-in-law Loghain, a legendary general. The three leaders plan to make a stand against the encroaching Darkspawn before a new <b>Blight</b> overwhelms Ferelden. Duncan senses the influence of an Archdemon, a god-like being hosted in the body of a powerful Dragon that commands the Darkspawn, which makes this the first true <b>Blight</b> in over 400 years. Duncan emphasizes the importance of defeating the <b>Blight</b> before it can gain enough momentum to threaten the rest of Thedas.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{diseases}} that {{can reduce the}} yield and market value of carrots.

I understand that my thesis may be made electronically available to the public. iii Inner city <b>blighted</b> industrial sites are primarily associated with the general phenomenon of deindustrialization within the post-industrial inner city that is caused by spatial and functional restructuring of the industrial activity. <b>Blighted</b> industrial sites are vacant, obsolete, or underutilized industrial buildings, facilities and other related industrial functions and areas. Such <b>blighted</b> areas may have physical, functional, social, economic, and environmental impact problems both within the site, {{as well as on}} surrounding properties. Brownfield sites represent a severe form of <b>blighted</b> sites which include real or perceived environmental contamination. Brownfield redevelopment requires environmental clean-up to acceptable regulatory standards which may result in a costly process. The general research goal is to achieve an understanding of this complex problem context as well as to establish the pertinent planning framework for redevelopment of <b>blighted</b> industrial site...|$|R

5|$|Microorganisms {{including}} bacteria, fungi, {{and viruses}} are important as plant pathogens, causing disease to crop plants. Fungi cause serious crop {{diseases such as}} maize leaf rust, wheat stem rust, and powdery mildew. Bacteria cause plant diseases including leaf spot and crown galls. Viruses cause plant diseases such as leaf mosaic. The oomycete Phytophthora infestans causes potato <b>blight,</b> contributing to the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s.|$|E
5|$|Other fungi {{affect the}} {{remainder}} of the plant. Another Botrytis fungus, Botrytis polyblastis (Sclerotinia polyblastis) causes brown spots on the flower buds and stems (narcissus fire), especially in damp weather and is a threat to the cut flower industry. Ramularia vallisumbrosae is a leaf spot fungus found in warmer climates, causing narcissus white mould disease. Peyronellaea curtisii, the Narcissus leaf scorch, also affects the leaves as does its synanamorph, Phoma narcissi (leaf tip <b>blight).</b> Aecidium narcissi causes rust lesions on leaves and stems.|$|E
5|$|The road's design {{varies from}} six lane dual {{carriageway}} to urban streets, {{the latter of}} which contribute to traffic congestion in London and are regularly featured on local traffic reports, particularly at Henlys Corner and Bounds Green in Northwest London. The uncertainty of development has caused urban decay and property <b>blight</b> along its route, and led to criticism over its poor pollution record. Several London Borough Councils have set up regeneration projects to improve the environment for communities surrounding the North Circular.|$|E

5|$|By the 1980s, {{planning}} <b>blight</b> {{had affected}} {{the area and}} many of the houses had become home to a community of artists and squatters. Eventually, contractors were appointed to carry out the work and a compulsory purchase of property along the proposed route was undertaken. In March 1993, in preparation for the construction of the road, the Earl of Caithness, then the Minister of State for Transport, estimated that there would be 263 properties scheduled for demolition, displacing 550 people, of which he estimated 172 were seeking rehousing. Several original residents, who had in some cases lived in their homes all their lives, refused to sell or move out of their properties.|$|E
5|$|Fungi create harm by spoiling food, {{destroying}} timber, and by causing {{diseases of}} crops, livestock, and humans. Fungi, mainly moulds like Penicillium and Aspergillus, spoil many stored foods. Fungi cause {{the majority of}} plant diseases, which in turn cause serious economic losses. Sometimes, as in the Great Irish Famine of 1845–1849, fungal diseases of plants, in this case potato <b>blight</b> caused by Phytophthora, result in large-scale human suffering. Fungi are similarly {{the main cause of}} economic losses of timber in buildings. Finally, fungi cause many diseases of humans and livestock; Aspergillosis kills some 600,000 people a year, mainly however those with already weakened immune systems.|$|E
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire <b>blight</b> and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E

5|$|In 1906 Bottomley entered {{parliament}} as Liberal Party {{member for}} Hackney South. In {{the same year}} he founded the popular magazine John Bull, which became a platform for Bottomley's trenchant populist views. Financial extravagance and mismanagement continued to <b>blight</b> his career, and in 1912 he had to resign from parliament after being declared bankrupt. The outbreak of war in 1914 revived his fortunes; as a journalist and orator Bottomley became a leading propagandist for the war effort, addressing well over 300 public meetings. His influence was such that it was widely expected that he would enter the War Cabinet, although he received no such offer.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013 the Sevenstone project, which {{aimed to}} {{demolish}} and rebuild {{a large part}} of the city centre, and had been on hold since 2009, was further delayed and the company developing it was dropped. The city council is looking for partners to take a new version of the plan forwards. In April 2014 the council, together with Sheffield University, proposed a plan to reduce the <b>blight</b> of empty shops in the city centre by offering them free of charge to small businesses on a month-by-month basis.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi are parasites on plants, animals (including humans), {{and other}} fungi. Serious {{pathogens}} of many cultivated plants causing extensive damage and losses to {{agriculture and forestry}} include the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, tree pathogens such as Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi causing Dutch elm disease and Cryphonectria parasitica responsible for chestnut <b>blight,</b> and plant pathogens in the genera Fusarium, Ustilago, Alternaria, and Cochliobolus. Some carnivorous fungi, like Paecilomyces lilacinus, are predators of nematodes, which they capture using an array of specialized structures such as constricting rings or adhesive nets.|$|E
