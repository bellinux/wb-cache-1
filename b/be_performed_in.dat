5|$|The first {{performance}} of Final Symphony was in Wuppertal, Germany at the Historische Stadthalle Wuppertal on May 11, 2013. The concert was held twice that day, {{performed by the}} Wuppertal Symphony Orchestra, and was conducted by Eckehard Stier, who had previously conducted for Symphonic Fantasies in Tokyo. The concert was very well received, {{and went on to}} <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> <b>in</b> five other cities around the world in 2013 and 2014. An album for the concert, recorded from a studio session by the London Symphony Orchestra, was released in 2015.

5|$|Aligned ZnO {{nanowires}} on pre-seeded silicon, glass, and {{gallium nitride}} substrates have been grown using aqueous zinc salts such as zinc nitrate and zinc acetate in basic environments. Pre-seeding substrates with ZnO creates sites for homogeneous nucleation of ZnO crystal during the synthesis. Common pre-seeding methods include in-situ thermal decomposition of zinc acetate crystallites, spincoating of ZnO nanoparticles {{and the use}} of physical vapor deposition methods to deposit ZnO thin films. Pre-seeding can <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with top down patterning methods such as electron beam lithography and nanosphere lithography to designate nucleation sites prior to growth. Aligned ZnO nanowires can be used in dye-sensitized solar cells and field emission devices.|$|E

5|$|Folding@home {{can use the}} {{parallel}} computing abilities of modern multi-core processors. The ability to use several CPU cores simultaneously allows completing the full simulation far faster. Working together, these CPU cores complete single work units proportionately faster than the standard uniprocessor client. This method is scientifically valuable because it enables much longer simulation trajectories to <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> <b>in</b> {{the same amount of}} time, and reduces the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many separate processors. A 2007 publication in the Journal of Molecular Biology relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the villin protein approximately 10 times longer than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} is {{most commonly used}} to weld stainless steel and nonferrous materials, such as aluminum and magnesium, {{but it can be}} applied to nearly all metals, with a notable exception being zinc and its alloys. Its applications involving carbon steels are limited not because of process restrictions, but because of the existence of more economical steel welding techniques, such as gas metal arc welding and shielded metal arc welding. Furthermore, GTAW can <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> <b>in</b> a variety of other-than-flat positions, depending on the skill of the welder and the materials being welded.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden wandered Europe as a {{poet and}} journalist. His plays {{continued}} to <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> <b>in</b> Europe and America, but rarely, if ever, did anyone send him royalties. His health deteriorated – a 1903 letter refers to asthma and spitting up blood – and he {{was running out of}} money. In 1903, he wrote Jacob Dinesohn from Paris, authorizing him to sell his remaining possessions in Romania, clothes and all. This gave him the money to head once more to New York in 1904.|$|E

It may also be appropriate in children young than 5, old people, and those with poor immune function. Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance. As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended. Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.|$|E
5|$|In May2010, Brulé donated $10,000 to a fund {{assisting}} an Edmonton boy {{suffering from}} lymphatic cystic hydroma.

Brulé received further media attention a year later for picking {{up a pair of}} hitchhikers {{who turned out to be}} Irish rock band U2 frontman Bono and his assistant in a West Vancouver neighbourhood on May31,2011. In return, Brulé was given backstage passes for him and his mother, for U2's concert in Edmonton on the next day. During the show, Bono thanked Brulé for the ride.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the Second World War the operas began to <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> <b>in</b> the major opera houses, and {{eventually}} were established in the general repertory. The resuscitation of Monteverdi's sacred music took longer; he did not benefit from the Catholic Church's 19th-century revival of Renaissance music {{in the way that}} Palestrina did, perhaps, as Carter suggests, because Monteverdi was viewed chiefly as a secular composer. It was not until 1932 that the 1610 Vespers were published in a modern edition, followed by Redlich's revision two years later. Modern editions of the Selva morales and Missa e Salmi volumes were published respectively in 1940 and 1942.|$|E

5|$|The Pavane (1887) was {{conceived}} and originally written as an orchestral piece. Fauré published the version for piano in 1889.

The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than crochet=100. Boult commented that the composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the Pavane was not a piece of German romanticism.|$|E

While the anthem is being performed, citizens are required to stand at attention and those in military or police uniform must salute.|$|E
5|$|The p-adic {{numbers are}} an {{alternative}} number system {{of interest in}} number theory. Like the real numbers, the p-adic numbers can be built from the rational numbers via Cauchy sequences; the construction uses a different metric in which 0 is closer to p, and much closer to pn, {{than it is to}} 1. The p-adic numbers form a field for prime p and a ring for other p, including 10. So arithmetic can <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> <b>in</b> the p-adics, and there are no infinitesimals.|$|E
