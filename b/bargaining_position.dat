5|$|In December 1971, {{following}} {{the defeat of}} South Vietnamese forces during Operation Lam Son 719, North Vietnamese leadership in Hanoi decided to launch a major military offensive against South Vietnam. In {{what became known as}} the Easter Offensive, the combined North Vietnamese and Việt Cộng forces employed combined arms tactics using heavy weapons that were a radical departure from the low-intensity guerrilla warfare of previous years. Although North Vietnam eventually used the equivalent of 14 army divisions, its leaders did not seek to win the war outright. Rather, their objective was to gain as much territory and destroy as many units of the South Vietnamese military as possible, in order to strengthen their <b>bargaining</b> <b>position</b> at the Paris Peace Talks.|$|E
5|$|Nassau and {{her three}} sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action {{at the end of}} October 1918, days before the Armistice was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer—by now the Grand Admiral (Großadmiral) of the fleet—intended to inflict as much damage as {{possible}} on the British navy, to improve Germany's <b>bargaining</b> <b>position,</b> despite the expected casualties. Many of the war-weary sailors felt that the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on Thüringen and then on several other battleships mutinied. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation.|$|E

5|$|The British <b>bargaining</b> <b>position</b> had worsened; the American {{scientists}} {{had decided that}} the United States no longer needed outside help, {{and they wanted to}} prevent Britain exploiting post-war commercial applications of atomic energy. The committee supported, and Roosevelt agreed to, restricting the flow of information to what Britain could use during the war—especially not bomb design—even if doing so slowed down the American project. By early 1943 the British stopped sending research and scientists to America, and as a result the Americans stopped all information sharing. The British considered ending the supply of Canadian uranium and heavy water to force the Americans to again share, but Canada needed American supplies to produce them. They investigated the possibility of an independent nuclear program, but determined that it could not be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Lộc Ninh {{was a major}} battle fought {{during the}} Easter Offensive during the Vietnam War, {{which took place in}} Bình Long Province, South Vietnam between 4–7 April 1972. Towards the end of 1971, North Vietnamese leaders decided to launch a major {{offensive}} against South Vietnam, with the objective of destroying Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) units and capturing as much territory as possible, in order to strengthen their <b>bargaining</b> <b>position</b> in the Paris Peace Accords. On 30 March 1972, two North Vietnamese Army divisions smashed through the Demilitarized Zone, marking the commencement of the Easter Offensive. They quickly overwhelmed South Vietnamese units in the I Corps Tactical Zone. With the rapid collapse of South Vietnamese forces in the northern provinces of South Vietnam, North Vietnamese and Việt Cộng forces began preparing for their next offensive, targeting Bình Long Province in the Mekong Delta region. On 4 April, the Việt Cộng's 5th Division opened their attack on Lộc Ninh, defended by the ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment. After three days of fighting, the vastly outnumbered South Vietnamese forces, though well supported by American air power, were forced to abandon their positions in Lộc Ninh.|$|E

40|$|After the disappointing {{outcome of}} the Copenhagen climate summit, it still remains to be {{explained}} why the participating states chose irreconcilable negotiation positions that reflected very diverse domestic interests {{in spite of a}} publicly displayed wish for cooperation. While environmental studies have intensely investigated national climate policies and their determinants over the last few decades, little {{attention has been paid to}} the <b>bargaining</b> <b>positions</b> the same governments assume in climate negotiations. We argue that their <b>bargaining</b> <b>positions</b> reflect structural, economic, and domestic factors, but less so strategic factors. A country’s vulnerability to climate change, its power and its democratic status are among the best predictors of its choice of negotiation position; its international interconnectedness, on the other hand, does not seem to have an influence. By comparing two negotiation issues – reducing emissions and financing climate mitigation – we can show that democracies choose rather different negotiation positions. When it comes to compensation mechanisms, democracies do not commit to substantial emission reduction targets due to pressure from industry at home. They are, however, more prepared than other states to pay for projects that help to reduce emissions. By understanding the choice of negotiation positions we can thus explain why the more or less cooperative <b>bargaining</b> <b>positions</b> adopted by states led to a breakdown of the Copenhagen negotiations. We investigated this question using a novel dataset on the UNFCCC negotiations, in which the positions of all participating governments were collected by hand-coding protocols from the negotiations as well as expert interviews with negotiators...|$|R

40|$|In {{bargaining}} environments with uncertain impasse outcomes (e. g., litigation or labor strike outcomes), {{there is}} an identification problem that confounds data interpretation. In such environments, the minimally acceptable settlement value from a risk-averse (risk-loving) but unbiased bargainer is empirically indistinguishable from what one could get with risk-neutrality and pessimism (optimism). This paper reports data from a controlled bargaining experiment where risk preferences and beliefs are both measured {{in order to assess}} their relative importance in bargaining outcomes. The average lab subject is risk-averse, yet optimistic, which is consistent with existing studies that examine each in isolation. I also find that the effects of optimism dominate those of risk-aversion. Optimistic bargainers are significantly more likely to dispute and have aggressive final <b>bargaining</b> <b>positions.</b> Dispute rates are not statistically affected by risk preferences, but {{there is some evidence that}} risk aversion leads to less aggressive <b>bargaining</b> <b>positions</b> and lower payoff outcomes. A key implication is that increased settlement rates are more likely achieved by minimizing impasse uncertainty (to limit the potential for optimism) rather than maximizing uncertainty (to weaken the reservation point of risk-averse bargainers), as has been argued in the dispute resolution literature. risk preference, optimism, bargaining, experiment...|$|R
30|$|The leading {{arguments}} {{that might explain}} differences in labor supply behavior, especially less specialization in intermarriage, are based on two observations: First, positive assortative matching by education, that is greater educational similarity of partners, is more pronounced in intermarriages than in other marital constellations, possibly leading to less comparative advantages and therefore fewer incentives to specialize. Second, <b>bargaining</b> <b>positions</b> of spouses in intermarriages differ from that in immigrant or native marriages, probably due to different outside options, different threat points and other factors determining bargaining strength.|$|R
