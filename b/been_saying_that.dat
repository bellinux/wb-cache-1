500|$|On July 21, 2016, Gingrich {{argued that}} members of NATO [...] "ought to worry" [...] about a U.S. {{commitment}} to their defense. He expanded, saying, [...] "They ought to worry about commitment under any circumstances. Every president has <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the NATO countries do not pay their fair share". He also stated that, {{in the context of}} whether the United States would provide aid to Estonia (a NATO member) {{in the event of a}} Russian invasion, he [...] "would think about it a great deal".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} when describing Chi's character, Clamp member Satsuki Igarashi stated [...] "Lately we've <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> {{the easiest to}} understand is Chii from 'Chobits.' Errors occur with computers. Things like 'Although it's fine to speak the instructions' and 'Please fix this problem here' might be spoken in a cute voice." [...] In addition, an explanation for Chobitss plot was given by Igarashi who stated: [...] "Back then, when our computer had problems all we would get were these inscrutable error messages. However, {{we had no idea}} what was wrong because it wouldn't tell us any more". Clamp also describes Chobits as a variation of the [...] "boy living with mysterious girl" [...] genre. Chi's design as a personal computer resulted from Ohkawa's wish to increase the sense of [...] "emotional discomfort" [...] around becoming emotionally involved with something considered to be merely a lifeless machine.|$|E
500|$|... "Gossip" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Several commentators particularly {{praised the}} comedic performance of Ed Helms, {{as well as}} the line by Kevin, [...] "Who's <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> there's another person inside of me working me with controls?" [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger called the episode [...] "not an instant classic, but a solid start to the season". Sepinwall said it started slowly, but gradually built to a [...] "very funny, and kinda sweet climax in the conference room". New York magazine writer Will Leitch said [...] "Gossip" [...] appeared to be a return to a more normal Office atmosphere, compared to the surprises and twists of the fifth season. Rick Ingebritson of The Palm Beach Post said he was concerned the season premiere would not be good because Steve Carell, John Krasinski and Ed Helms would be too distracted with their growing film careers. But, he said, [...] "Thankfully, if Thursday's premiere was any indication, it appears that the Dunder Mifflin crew still has a lot to offer." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons said, [...] "'Gossip' had some terrific moments, but I don't know that I'd put it on my all-time great episodes list." [...] She specifically praised the performances of Brian Baumgartner and Jenna Fischer.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Zemeckis donated $5 million {{towards the}} Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts at USC, a [...] center. When the Center opened in March 2001, Zemeckis {{spoke in a}} panel {{about the future of}} film, {{alongside}} friends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Of those (including Spielberg) who clung to celluloid and disparaged the idea of shooting digitally, Zemeckis said, [...] "These guys are the same ones who have <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> LPs sound better than CDs. You can argue that until you're blue in the face, but I don't know anyone who's still buying vinyl. Film, as we have traditionally thought of it, is going to be different. But the continuum is man's desire to tell stories around the campfire. The only thing that keeps changing is the campfire." [...] The Robert Zemeckis Center currently hosts many film school classes, much of the Interactive Media Division, and Trojan Vision, USC's student television station, which has been voted the number one college television station in the country.|$|E
