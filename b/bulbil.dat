40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{successful}} application of the vitrification technique for cryopreserving apices sampled from <b>bulbils</b> and cloves of garlic. With <b>bulbils,</b> survival and regrowth of control apices were generally high after treatment with PVS 2 and PVS 3 vitrification solutions.

50|$|Alpine bistort is a {{perennial}} herb that grows to 5 to 15 cm tall. It has a thick rhizomatous rootstock and an erect, unbranched, hairless stem. The leaves are hairless {{on the upper}} surfaces, but hairy and greyish-green below. The basal ones are longish-elliptical with long stalks and rounded bases; the upper ones are few and are linear and stalkless. The tiny flowers are white or pink in {{the upper part of}} the spike with five perianth segments, eight stamens with purple anthers and three fused carpels. The lower ones are replaced by bulbils. Flowers rarely produce viable seeds and reproduction is normally by the bulbils, which are small bulb-like structures that develop in the axils of the leaves and may develop into new plants. Very often, a small leaf develops when the <b>bulbil</b> is still attached to the mother plant. The bulbils are rich in starch and are a preferred food for rock ptarmigans (Lagopus mutus) and reindeer; they are also occasionally used by Arctic people. Alpine bistort flowers in June and July.|$|E

40|$|Background: Amarkand tubers are {{routinely}} {{used by many}} Indian tribes as a specialized food for health and longevity but so far {{there is no scientific}} evidence for their activities. Taxonomically, Amarkand belong to genera Eulophia and Dioscorea. Methods: In this communication, comparative antifatigue potential of Amarkand was analyzed using forced swimming model in rats and evaluated using biomarkers of physical fatigue. Results: Methanol extracts of tubers of D. bulbifera, E. ochreata, E. leghapanensis and <b>bulbils</b> of D. bulbifera exhibited rich polyphenolic content. D. bulbifera <b>bulbils</b> and E. ochreata significantly prolonged the swimming endurance time.

5000|$|The {{songs are}} {{composed}} by Vijayan {{and his brother}} A. Ramachandran, both of them members of Mahatma Memorial Association. Background score was by Mahatma Sangeethamela, a subdivision of the Association. There are eleven songs in the film, and the playback singers include Kamukara Pusushothaman and Santha P. Nair. Ramachandran, one of the composers, says that all the songs were for a specific purpose, such as showing the passage of time. He adds his amazement about important singers agreeing to sing for them. The re-recording was done by Ramachandran alone, without his brother Vijayan, due to illness; {{he was not able}} to transfer the songs to better recording media due to inexperience. Lyrics were penned by K. C. Poonkunnam and P. Gangadharan Nair. Three traditional poems were also used. Nine songs were recorded from Merryland Studios, while the songs [...] "Chirichukondeevazhikku" [...] and [...] "Pazhaya Yugangal" [...] were recorded from Udaya Studios and from a studio in Madras respectively. Malayalam film music was copied from Hindi and Tamil film songs in those times. Ramadas wanted to change this system and in Newspaper Boy, all the tunes are original and follows the folk traditions of the State. Different from the films of that time, majority of songs were used as montage songs that appeared in the background of the film. Audio rights were bought by a newly formed Bombay-based company named <b>Bulbil.</b> But the company closed down before the film's release and no records were released.|$|E
5000|$|Watsonia meriana is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the iris family (Iridaceae) known by the common name <b>bulbil</b> bugle-lily. It {{is one of several}} Watsonia species known as wild watsonia. It is native to the Cape Provinces of South Africa, but it is well known as an ornamental plant grown in gardens for its showy spikes of flowers and an invasive species in areas where it has escaped cultivation. It is a perennial herb growing from a fibrous-coated corm and growing to a maximum height well over one meter when in flower, sometimes reaching two meters. Each corm produces three or four erect, lance-shaped leaves that measure up to 60 centimeters long by 6 wide. They have thickened midribs and margins. The inflorescence is an open spike of 8 to 25 flowers which may be any most any shade of orange to reddish or purplish. The flower is up to 8 centimeters long with a long, tubular throat and spreading tepals. The flowers sometimes yield capsule fruits which contain seed, but the plant often reproduces via bulbils (strictly speaking, cormlets) that form in clusters in the axils of bracts at nodes along the peduncle. The bulbils can sprout if dropped into the soil, sometimes forming dense colonies, as can sections of corm that are chopped and dispersed by plowing or by non-intensive feeding by root-eating animals. The plant is accordingly ecologically valuable as feed to local mole-rats (Cryptomys and Georychus species) and to Cape porcupines (Hystrix africaeaustralis) ...|$|E
40|$|Aerial bulbils are an {{important}} propagative organ, playing {{an important}} role in population expansion. However, the detailed gene regulatory patterns and molecular mechanism underlying <b>bulbil</b> formation remain unclear. Triploid Lilium lancifolium, which develops many aerial bulbils on the leaf axils of middle-upper stem, is a useful species for investigating <b>bulbil</b> formation. To investigate the mechanism of <b>bulbil</b> formation in triploid L. lancifolium, we performed histological and transcriptomic analyses using samples of leaf axils located in the upper and lower stem of triploid L. lancifolium during <b>bulbil</b> formation. Histological results indicated that the bulbils of triploid L. lancifolium are derived from axillary meristems that initiate de novo from cells on the adaxial side of the petiole base. Transcriptomic analysis generated ~ 650 million high-quality reads and 11, 871 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional analysis showed that the DEGs were significantly enriched in starch and sucrose metabolism and plant hormone signal transduction. Starch synthesis and accumulation likely promoted the initiation of upper bulbils in triploid L. lancifolium. Hormone-associated pathways exhibited distinct patterns of change in each sample. Auxin likely promoted the initiation of bulbils and then inhibited further <b>bulbil</b> formation. High biosynthesis and low degradation of cytokinin might have led to <b>bulbil</b> formation in the upper leaf axil. The present study achieved a global transcriptomic analysis focused on gene expression changes and pathways' enrichment during upper <b>bulbil</b> formation in triploid L. lancifolium, laying a solid foundation for future molecular studies on <b>bulbil</b> formation...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{demand on}} glucomannan as healthy diet in develop countries, {{promotes}} higher planting area of Amorphophallus. Iles-iles corm (Amorphophallus muelleri) contains {{high percentage of}} glucomannan. In order to meet with increasing demand, providing mass planting materials is a great concern in Indonesia. Therefore, the study on skin corm and <b>bulbil</b> as propagation materials was conducted. In the first experiment, <b>bulbil</b> with different size and section, i. e., very small, small, medium and large, and half section and ¼ section were used. In the second experiment, we evaluated the prospect of skin corm as propagul where different size of skin corm was used, i. e., 1 cm x 1 cm, 2 cm x 2 cm, and 4 cm x 4 cm. Results showed that both <b>bulbil</b> and skin corm could be utilized as prospectivepropagules of iles-iles. Propagation using <b>bulbil</b> was more superior as compared to skin corm. <b>Bulbil</b> of both whole and sectioned had high emergence of bud (> 90 %), except very small sized ones. Very small <b>bulbil</b> (diameter less than 1 cm) resulted in ca 605 of emergence. Skin corm sized 4 cm x 4 cm produced equal emergence to medium <b>bulbil.</b> In general, increasing size of skin corm increased success of emergent bud. Delaying emergence on small sized skin corm could be assessed by smaller nutrient reserved.

The first basal leaf, which is as well the first to decay during flowering season, develops the replacement bulb; the second, very rarely the third as well, develops usually one basal <b>bulbil</b> which is on a saccate enlargement of the basal leaf, which forms a short stolon. Larger non-flowering plants (34 of 114, mean bulb diam. 2.20  ±  0.40) developed a <b>bulbil</b> (Fig.  3 d–f). From 291 flowering plants measured, the weaker individuals (131 plants, mean bulb diam. 2.72  ±  0.56) did not yet develop a <b>bulbil,</b> the larger ones (160 plants, mean bulb diam. 3.24  ±  0.69  mm) supported a basal <b>bulbil</b> (diam. 1.26  ±  0.39  mm).

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the effect of proton beam radiation on production of <b>bulbil</b> and tuber including change of endogenous gibberellins, of Dioscorea opposita Thunb. The yield of bulbils and tubers from non- and irradiated D. opposita Thunb at doses of 5, 10, 15 and 20 Gy were determined. Endogenous gibberellins were also quantified by GC/MS analysis. D. opposita tubers irradiated at 15 Gy produced higher <b>bulbil</b> production than non-irradiated plants. Enlarged <b>bulbil</b> (above size diameter 4 mm) was significantly increased at 15 Gy. Bioactive endogenous GA 4 was dominant in bulbils and tubers irradiated with proton beam rather than GA 1.

The experiment was done in the Faculty of Agriculture UPN "Veteran" Yogyakarta experimental field in Condongcatur, at 115 m asl, at the beginning of rainy season of 2010 / 2011. The experiment was done with two-factors and three replications constructed in Randomized Block Design.

30|$|Gagea lutea {{differs from}} the two arid-zone species by another {{important}} character: a switch in ontogenesis between <b>bulbil</b> production and seed production (Schnittler et al. 2009). If plants gain resources (indicated by larger replacement bulbs), they produce first only bulbils, not flowers. Above a certain threshold in parent bulb size, only flowers, no bulbils, are developed. In such species, the resource threshold (expressed as diameter of the parent bulb) for <b>bulbil</b> production is always lower than that for flower/seed development (Schnittler et al. 2013). Species lacking a switch start to develop a single to several bulbils {{as soon as the}} replacement bulb has reached a certain diameter and then continue to form them indefinitely throughout the life of the plant. In such species, the threshold for flower/seed development may be lower than that for <b>bulbil</b> development, as it is the case in G. bulbifera and G. graeca (Table  2). From this reason, a direct comparison in terms of resources allocated to bulbils vs. seeds is impossible due to the switch in G. lutea: plants of this species never invest simultaneously into seeds and bulbils.|$|E

Pollen viability and germination rate were counted for at least 200 pollen grains in triplicate for each inflorescence. Chromosome counting was performed to confirm R. vivipara as triploid species. The bulbiliferous shoots of both R. vivipara and R. pumila initiate from the upper portions of tubers. As they elongate upward, <b>bulbil</b> clusters generates in each node of the shoot. Bulbils develop several hooked scales on top simultaneously, which facilitate dispersal because they can easily attach to the animal’s fur. Although R. vivipara produces showy flowers in spring, their pollen grains were inviable and unable to germinate in vitro in sucrose solution, when compared with R. pumila.
