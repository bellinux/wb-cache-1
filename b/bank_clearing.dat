40|$|Clearing {{has been}} an {{important}} part of the banking system and will always remain a part of it for years to come. Clearing in banking indicates the transfer of fund from one person to another. This clearing of the fund can take place in 2 ways either through cash or through cheque. There has been no major change in the cash transactions except for the changes in the value of money. However, the cheque clearing system has undergone a lot of changes. The origin of cheque can be traced back to the first century AD, where banks in and around Persia used to issue letters of credit called “Sakks” wherein the banks used to pay the identified payees as per the instructions. This eliminated the cumbersome process of carrying money or gold which was very risky. Changes have taken place in cheque clearing over the period of time. From ordinary cheque clearing to MICR clearing and finally to the latest in clearing ‘Cheque Truncation System’.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to study the {{monetary}} origins of the Italian banking crisis of 1893. The Italian experience under the Gold Standard {{can be seen as}} paradoxical. Italy came back to the gold standard in 1881 and very soon after, its economy suffered inflation, asset prices inflation and a major banking crisis. Was the Gold Standard rule at the origin of the crisis? In fact, Italy came back to the gold standard after a long period of suspension of convertibility (since 1866). An international borrowing allowed the country to restore an official gold convertibility. With this international borrowing, Italy has taken commitments toward international community (especially France) to respect the constraint of the Gold Standard. Nevertheless, the structural deficit in public finance (public spending was always above the revenues of the Italian state for military reasons and infrastructure development) was not resolved. Public spending was financed by borrowing and money creation. The government managed to keep inflation repressed and used every desperate means to prevent gold to flee from Italy. These means were the restrictions to <b>bank</b> <b>clearing</b> and protectionism. The Italian government has been led to intervene more and more in the economy for easing the consequences of the inflation. The banking crisis was forwarded by inflation in assets prices (especially housing boom) and consumer prices {{at the end of the}} 1880 years. The paper explains the links between state borrowing, restrictions to <b>bank</b> <b>clearing</b> and economic crisis. We used banks of issue balance sheets to show the monetary creation in order to finance public deficit. Our major sources fo...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of monetary policy over interest rates, and via interest rates over non-financial economic activity, {{stems from the}} central bank's role as a monopolist over the supply of bank reserves. Several trends already visible {{in the financial markets}} of many countries today threaten to weaken or even undermine the relevance of that monopoly, and with it the efficacy of monetary policy. These developments include the erosion of the demand for bank-issued money, the proliferation of non-bank credit and aspects of the operation of <b>bank</b> <b>clearing</b> mechanisms. What to make of these threats from a public policy perspective [...] in particular, whether to undertake potentially aggressive regulatory measures in an effort to forestall them [...] depends in large part on one's view of the contribution of monetary policy towards successful economic performance.

The seminar covered aspects dealing with technical issues, hardware issues and system and software issues. Different technical systems and products were discussed.

The use of methods and methodological questions were discussed. In the first years everything was built from scratch, including operating systems, terminal interfaces and so on. The use of methods, at least documented methods, were sparse in the pioneering years. As the use of computers increased and the systems themselves grew larger, standards began to emerge and there was a number of infrastructure issues and the establishment of common platforms.

40|$|The German {{financial}} system {{is complex and}} highly diversified. The second most important class of financial institutions is insurance and pension companies. Germany has taken steps to enhance accounting and auditing practices and to align corporate governance with best international practices. The German banking system is resilient, but relevant indicators show some deterioration. The main vulnerability facing all sectors of the insurance industry is the pressure on capital ratios and risk-bearing capacity from the poor performance of investment portfolios.
