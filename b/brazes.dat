40|$|The Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) {{consists}} of 1080 conical tubes, which are furnace <b>brazed</b> themselves, manifolds, and surrounding structural jacket making almost four miles of <b>braze</b> joints. Subsequent furnace <b>braze</b> cycles are performed due to localized <b>braze</b> voids between the coolant tubes. SSME nozzle experiences extremely high heat flux (180 mW/sq m) during hot fire. <b>Braze</b> voids between coolant tubes {{may result in}} hot combustion gas escape causing jacket bulges. The nozzle can be disqualified for flight or result in mission failure if the <b>braze</b> voids exceed the limits. Localized <b>braze</b> processes were considered to eliminate <b>braze</b> voids, however, damage to the parent materials often prohibited use of such process. Being the only manned flight reusable rocket engine, it has stringent requirement on the <b>braze</b> process. Poor <b>braze</b> quality or damage to the parent materials limits the nozzle service life. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a laser <b>brazing</b> process to provide quality, localized <b>braze</b> joints without adverse affect on the parent materials. Gold (Au-Cu-Ni-Pd-Mn) based high temperature <b>braze</b> alloys were used in both powder and wire form. Thin section iron base superalloy A 286 tube was used as substrate materials. Different Laser Systems including CO 2 (10. 6 micrometers, 1 kW), ND:YAG (1. 06 micrometers, 4 kW). and direct diode laser (808 nm. 150 W) were investigated for <b>brazing</b> process. The laser process variables including wavelength. laser power, travel speed and angle of inclination were optimized according to bead geometry and <b>braze</b> alloy wetting at minimum heat input level, The properties of laser <b>brazing</b> were compared to that of furnace <b>brazing.</b> Microhardness profiles were used for <b>braze</b> joint property comparison between laser and furnace <b>brazing.</b> The cooling rate of laser <b>brazing</b> was compared to furnace <b>brazing</b> based on secondary dendritic arm spacing, Both optical and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) were used to evaluate the microstructures of the <b>braze</b> materials and tube substrate. Metallography of the laser <b>braze</b> joint was compared to the furnace <b>braze.</b> SEM Energy Disperse X-Ray Spectra (EDX) and back scattered imaging were used to analyze <b>braze</b> alloy segregation. Although all of the laser systems, CO 2, ND:YAG, and direct diode laser produced good <b>braze</b> joint, the direct diode laser was selected for its system simplicity, compactness and portability. Excellent laser and <b>braze</b> alloy coupling is observed with powder alloy compared to <b>braze</b> alloy wire. Good wetting is found with different gold based <b>braze</b> alloys. The laser <b>brazing</b> process can be optimized so that the adverse affect on the parent materials can be eliminated. Metallography of the laser <b>braze</b> joint has shown that quality <b>braze</b> joint was produced with laser <b>brazing</b> process. Penetration of the laser <b>braze</b> to the substrate is at neglectable level. Zero penetration is observed. Microstructure examinations shown that no observable changes of the microstructure (grain structure and precipitation) in the HAZ area between laser <b>braze</b> and furnace <b>braze.</b> Wide gaps can be laser <b>brazed</b> with single pass for up to 0. 024 inches. Finer dendritic structure is observed in laser <b>brazing</b> compared with equiaxial and coarser grain of the furnace <b>brazing</b> microstructure. Greater segregation is also found in the furnace <b>braze.</b> Higher hardness of the laser <b>braze</b> joint comparing to furnace <b>braze</b> is observed due to the fast cooling rate and Finer microstructure in the laser <b>brazing.</b> Laser <b>braze</b> joint properties meet or exceed the furnace joint properties. Direct diode laser for thin section tube <b>brazing</b> with high temperature <b>braze</b> alloys have been successfully demonstrated. The laser's high energy density and precise control has shown significant advantages in reducing process heat input to the substrates and provide high quality <b>braze</b> joints comparing to other localized <b>braze</b> process such as torch, TIG, and MPTA processes. Significant cost savings can be realized particularly with localized <b>braze</b> comparing to a full furnace <b>braze</b> cycle...|$|R

50|$|On wetting, <b>brazes</b> may {{liberate}} {{elements from}} the base metal. For example, aluminium-silicon braze wets silicon nitride, dissociates the surface so it can react with silicon, and liberates nitrogen, which may create voids along the joint interface and lower its strength. Titanium-containing nickel-gold braze wets silicon nitride and reacts with its surface, forming titanium nitride and liberating silicon; silicon then forms brittle nickel silicides and eutectic gold-silicon phase; the resulting joint is weak and melts at much lower temperature than may be expected.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>brazes</b> come in {{the form}} of trifoils, {{laminated}} foils of a carrier metal clad with a layer of braze at each side. The center metal is often copper; its role is to act as a carrier for the alloy, to absorb mechanical stresses due to e.g. differential thermal expansion of dissimilar materials (e.g. a carbide tip and a steel holder), and to act as a diffusion barrier (e.g. to stop diffusion of aluminium from aluminium bronze to steel when brazing these two).|$|E

40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFC) consist of ceramic and {{metallic}} components which {{have to be}} joined and sealed for operation at high temperatures up to 850 °C in dual atmospheres. Appropriate sealing materials have to match the CTE of these materials, must withstand the harsh chemical environment and must show good long term stability under operating conditions. Glasses and glass-ceramics are widely used to fulfil these requirements. Nevertheless they are afflicted with several drawbacks which can be avoided in case of active brazing process. The conventional brazing technologies are not suitable to join ceramics. Therefore active <b>brazes</b> containing an additional reactive phase which realizes the adhesion to the ceramic surface by an oxidation reaction should be used.
