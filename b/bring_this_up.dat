500|$|A {{few days}} before the election, Humphrey gained the {{endorsement}} of his former rival Eugene McCarthy. During a stop in Pittsburgh, Humphrey stated that the endorsement made him a [...] "happy man." [...] The hopes of victory for Humphrey also began to look up as a bombing pause was achieved and that negotiations had progressed, cutting Nixon's 18 point lead to 2 points at the end of October. The Soviet Union had tried to influence the North Vietnamese to soften on the negotiations to prevent a Nixon victory, but Nixon publicly accused President Johnson of speeding up the negotiations. Contemporary sources reveal that Nixon was personally involved in preventing the South Vietnamese from coming to the negotiation table, through the use of operative Anna Chennault who advised Saigon that a Nixon administration would offer them a better deal. Members of the campaign later claimed that Humphrey did not <b>bring</b> <b>this</b> <b>up</b> before the election, because {{he did not want to}} appear desperate while polls placed him even with Nixon. Humphrey held his final campaign rally at the Houston Astrodome on November 3 alongside President Johnson. Governor Connally did not attend the event, causing suspicion that he would back Nixon, but he later assured Humphrey that he would not do so. During his speech at the rally, Humphrey asked Americans to base their vote on hope rather than fear. The next day, the eve of the election, he appeared in Los Angeles with Muskie, and was greeted by 100,000 supporters. Later that day, Humphrey and Nixon each held four-hour televised forums from Los Angeles on rival television networks. Humphrey's on ABC-TV at 8:30pm EST, Nixon's on NBC-TV at 9pm EST. Humphrey, with Muskie by his side, fielded questions from a live studio audience and a phone bank of celebrities including Frank Sinatra and Paul Newman. The Nixon telecast featured no interaction with anyone other than sports personally Bud Wilkinson who read queries from index cards beside rows of volunteers taking calls. Muskie, commenting on the Republican broadcast from their studios noted that Spiro Agnew was nowhere to be found and how it appeared to be staged. [...] Nixon tried to reverse Humphrey's boost from the bombing halt by stating that he had been advised that [...] "tons of supplies" [...] were being sent along the Ho Chi Minh Trail by the North Vietnamese, a shipment that could not be stopped. Humphrey described these claims as [...] "irresponsible," [...] which prompted Nixon to proclaim that Humphrey [...] "doesn't know what's going on." [...] McCarthy called in during Humphrey's telethon and affirmed his support for the ticket. Edward Kennedy videotaped an endorsement for Humphrey from his home in Massachusetts.|$|E

50|$|King Benjamin's {{discourse}} in chapters 2 through 9 {{is considered by}} many Book of Mormon readers to be a significant piece of the Book of Mormon. The king spoke of his life in service to the people, and how he even labored with his own hands that the people would not be unduly burdened with taxes. Yet he does not <b>bring</b> <b>this</b> <b>up</b> to boast, only to affirm that he has really been in the service of God. The King served God by serving his fellow human beings. He brings this to their mind as an example. If he, their king, labored to serve the people, then the people ought to labor to serve one another. And if he, their earthly king, merits any thanks from the people, how much more does God their heavenly king merit thanks from them. Yet if the people served God with all their power, they would remain in reality unprofitable servants, because God causes them to exist from instant to instant. The only thing God really requires from them in payment for creating the people and keeping them alive is for them to keep his commandments. He speaks of an angelic visitation and prophecies of Jesus Christ, his birth, identifying his mother as being named Mary, his ministry and miracles, his suffering, death and resurrection. He speaks of Jesus as being the judge, of his atonement as the means to overcome sin and the tendencies of the natural man in order to become a holy person. He emphasizes the importance to have faith in Jesus and to repent in order to become a child of Jesus Christ through His atonement.|$|E

40|$|With {{astonishing}} diligence {{the thick}} third volume {{of this important}} work has been produced. Among the 79 families treated there are some large or very large ones, e. g. Anacardiaceae, Apocynaceae, Asclepiadaceae, Compositae, Cruciferae, and Cucurbitaceae. There is a general introduction for Dicotyledones, with a survey of phyletic affinities assumed by Takhtajan, Von Wettstein, and Hutchinson respectively, chemical characteristics of Dicots, alcaloid occurrence in Dicot. families, the occurrence of ‘pseudoindikanen’ and allied compounds, occurrence of salicyl compounds. After the family treatments, which are executed as in vol. 2, there is a fairly large amount of addenda to these families, and a large index. An analysis showed that of the 79 families treated the author says that 42 are distinctly insufficiently known phytochemically, and 17 are virtually unknown.

40|$|In celebrating Luigi Mengoni {{as one of}} {{the eminent}} jurists of {{the second half of the}} past century, the idea which in a {{complete}} way expresses his importance is that of modernity. This does not mean that Mengoni was an avant-garde jurist. He is modern in the sense that, open to what is new, he interprets his task as that of providing the possibility for what is new of survival beyond the historical moment of its appearence. This way is that of inserting the new in the cultural context, contributing in turn to <b>bring</b> <b>this</b> <b>up</b> to date. Mengoni applies this method when he works in typical private law topics, as that of liability for non performance or more in general on obligation, as well as when investigating territories closer to general theory of law like that of general clauses or of relationship between law and other fields of culture. Thus in exploring the relevance of technique from the perspective of law, he arrives at the question of law and morals, asserting that a law completely detached from morals ends up being a normative discourse merely ancillary to technique...|$|E
