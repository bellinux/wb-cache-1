50|$|A true {{telephoto}} lens {{is designed to}} require less <b>bellows</b> <b>extension</b> than a long-focus lens of the same focal length.|$|E
50|$|In {{two years}} at the Creative Circus, image {{students}} learn the necessary skills of lighting, composition, <b>bellows</b> <b>extension</b> compensation and digital retouching. They also learn to collaborate with writers, art directors and designers as they create conceptual, strategic pieces of art.|$|E
50|$|The New F-1 is an {{expandable}} system. It {{consists of}} interchangeable viewfinders, focusing screens, motor drives, and alternate backs, {{all of which}} are specific to the New F-1. All other Canon components, such as the FD lens series, close up accessories (<b>bellows,</b> <b>extension</b> tubes, etc.), and Canon A and T Speedlights (except the 300TL) are also compatible with the system.|$|E
50|$|About 18 {{interchangeable}} camera lenses, some viewfinders {{and focusing}} screens, film holders (also for instant film), different <b>bellows</b> and <b>extension</b> rail sets for close ups were offered.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, a {{range of}} special lenses without {{focusing}} thread (to be used with <b>bellows</b> or focusing <b>extension</b> tube) were also available for macro work: ...|$|R
5000|$|CONTAX AX - This had {{a unique}} {{autofocus}} system that worked with manual focus lenses {{by moving the}} film plane inside the camera. A side benefit of this arrangement is that it allowed the AX to feature a macro mode which worked much like a built-in 10 mm extension tube, allowing for a magnification ratio higher than 1:1 {{without the use of}} <b>bellows</b> or <b>extension</b> tubes. By using of a special adaptor made by Kyocera, Hasselblad V-series lenses could also be used on all CONTAX C/Y mount cameras. Thus users could perform auto-focus of Hasselblad V-series lenses with AX.|$|R
50|$|The camera must {{be set up}} in a {{suitable}} position. In some cases the subject can also be manipulated, as in a studio. In others the camera must be positioned to photograph subjects such as landscapes. The camera must be mounted in a way that prevents camera motion {{for the duration of the}} exposure. Usually a tripod is used—a camera with a long <b>bellows</b> <b>extension</b> may require two.|$|E
50|$|Two {{kinds of}} bellows are {{commonly}} used on cameras; bag bellows are normally used with a lens of short focal length, and accordion bellows with a much longer range of extension. For large format cameras, “double extension” refers to bellows that extend to a length equal to about twice the focal length of a standard lens, e.g. 300 mm for the 4×5 inch format. “Triple extension” for the same format indicates <b>bellows</b> <b>extension</b> of 450 to 500 mm.|$|E
50|$|The Reisekamera {{might be}} {{considered}} the portable version of the studio camera, to be used outside the professional photographic studio, on assignment at location, for architectural work or documentation away from the studio, in homes or museums. It is collapsible, yet not small, and it is much too cumbersome and large for the travelling amateur to bring along. The <b>bellows</b> <b>extension</b> would allow a selection of focal length lenses to be employed covering the required field of view. The back panel may be tilted and turned slightly, and at the front, the lens plate may slide vertically and horizontally to control perspective and distortion. The Reisekamera {{would be one of}} several cameras suitable for field assignments. A black cloth is required to keep stray light out while observing the image on the ground glass focusing screen. When the image is composed and focused, the focusing screen is replaced by the plate holder. The lens cap is placed on the lens, the dark slide removed from the plate holder, and the lens cap is removed for the required exposure time and replaced. If an auxiliary shutter is present, it may perform the function of the lens cap. After the exposure the dark slide is replaced to protect the exposed plate from stray light. The plate holder is either turned for a second photo, or brought to the darkroom for plate development and copying. The camera would be supplied with a number of plate holders, each usually holding two plates, one on either side.|$|E
50|$|Some common {{features}} of 35mm SLR photography were first {{seen on the}} Topcon RE Super. Among these is the through-the-lens exposure metering. This enabled improved exposure accuracy, especially in close-up macro photography using <b>bellows</b> or <b>extension</b> rings, and in telephotography with long lenses. In addition to this feature, the metering is at full aperture. For this purpose the RE-lensese have an aperture simulator that relays the preset aperture to the exposure meter at full aperture, retaining a bright viewfinder image while determining the correct exposure, avoiding the stop-down method. The meter also works independently of the pentaprism finder, which allows for different viewfinder configurations. The meter cell is actually incorporated in the camera's reflex finder mirror. This was accomplished by milling narrow slits in the mirror surface letting {{a fraction of the}} light through to the CdS cell placed just behind it.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Detailed {{analyses}} of snow crystal sequence and atmospheric conditions were accomplished utilizing macrophotographic techniques for obtaining the snow crystal record at Santiam Pass in the Oregon Cascades on 19 - 20 January, 14 - 15 February, and 9 - 10 March, 1967. The photographic equipment {{consisted of a}} 35 millimeter single lens reflex camera, <b>bellows,</b> and <b>extension</b> tubes which facilitated macro-photography. To conduct crystal studies, problems inherent with crystal photography required solutions. The synoptic {{data for this study}} were extracted from teletype reports, facsimile charts, radio-sonde soundings, and surface observations from U. S. Weather Bureau and Federal Aviation Administration weather stations. The several storms analyzed indicated a crystal sequence commencing with high altitude crystal types progressing to low altitude crystal types with the passage of a warm front occlusion, and a sequence of low altitude crystal types changing to a wide, intermittent crystal type spectra representative of convective and orographic activity following the passage of a cold front occlusion. A relationship between ceiling heights and crystal types was noted in two synoptic situations involving frontal passages. Low ceilings over the valley stations were associated with crystal types from high altitudes and high ceilings were associated with crystals from low altitudes which exhibited riming...|$|R
40|$|Commercial digital photogrammetric {{software}} {{has been}} applied to convergent stereoscopic photography of human tooth replicas prepared to exhibit optical texture resulting in successful generation of 3 D coordinate data. Tooth replicas were imaged using a semi-metric 35 mm camera and f = 100 mm macro lens on <b>extension</b> <b>bellows.</b> Model precision was within acceptable limits of 12 μm or better for manual target matching and 21 μm or better for automatic image matching. Further improvement in optical texture is required to achieve automatic image matching precision comparable to that of manual target matching. Small errors in interior orientation parameters attributed to instability in the bellows as well as small errors in the relative orientation resulted in some systematic errors. The use of a fixed camera lens system is expected to reduce these errors. When combined with commercially available, moderately priced, digital SLR cameras this brings 3 D model generation closer to everyday clinical dental practice...|$|R
5000|$|There {{was a full}} line of {{specialized}} equipment available for these system cameras that included microscope adaptor, <b>extension</b> <b>bellows,</b> stereo attachments, medical attachments and various specialized finder screens. Equipment is fully compatible between all models manufactured between 1936 and 1969. The spelling found on cameras has traditionally been Exakta, but some early Kine-Exaktas were marked Exacta specifically for marketing in France, Portugal and the U.S., perhaps for copyright reasons; and certainly {{a great number of}} American collectors refer to the whole range as the [...] "Exacta." [...] A related line of smaller, simpler cameras was the [...] "Exa" [...] line; these, too, existed in several variations. The Beseler Topcon line of 35mm cameras used the same lens mount as the Exakta. In the early 1970s the Exakta [...] "RTL 1000" [...] was introduced; it accepted the older models' lenses but had its own range of viewfinders, which included a model with through-the-lens light metering. M42 lens mount variants of the RTL line of cameras also appeared under the Practica name.|$|R
50|$|At long last, Rollei had {{a camera}} that could match the Hasselbad 500C. Indeed, {{had it been}} {{released}} earlier, around 1960 say, {{it could have been}} enormously successful. On top of that, despite declining profit margins and tough competition from the Japanese, Rollei continued to target its advertising at the amateur market. In contrast, other companies such as Leitz and Hasselblad had better understood how to promote their expensive cameras in photographic magazines - not just through paid advertising, but also through feature articles in the editorial pages. As a result, the SL66 never sold in the numbers that the company had hoped for or needed. Nevertheless, Rollei owes its survival as a company to the SL66 camera system, along with its enduring reputation for quality. Its successor, the SL66E, was released in 1984; externally the camera was largely unchanged, but it now had a built-in light meter. Additional lenses were released, such as the Fisheye-Distagon (f/3.5, 30 mm), the Distagon (f/4, 40 mm), and the Sonnar (f/4, 150 mm) with a between-the-lens shutter along with more accessories including close-up lenses, <b>extension</b> <b>bellows,</b> a Polaroid film cassette, a sheet film cassette, an underwater housing, and a ring flash unit. Its successor, the SL66-X, released in 1968 only had TTL flash metering, while the SL66-SE (Special Edition) also included a standard light meter. Prior to this, TTL metering required a special prism viewfinder with a built-in light meter. The release in 1992 of the SE Exclusive Professional incorporating selective gold-plating on the housing marked the end of the SL66 series.|$|R
