5|$|At a <b>barometric</b> <b>pressure</b> of 218 atmospheres, the {{critical}} point {{of water is}} 375°C. At a depth of 3,000meters, the <b>barometric</b> <b>pressure</b> of sea water is more than 300atmospheres (as salt water is denser than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407°C (see image). However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water emerging from the hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents, black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a supercritical fluid, possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Rita is {{the fourth}} strongest Atlantic {{hurricane}} in terms of <b>barometric</b> <b>pressure</b> and one of three tropical cyclones from 2005 on the list, with the others being Wilma and Katrina at first and sixth, respectively. However, with a <b>barometric</b> <b>pressure</b> of 895mbar (hPa; 26.43inHg), Rita is the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricanes Camille, Mitch, and Dean share intensities for the seventh strongest Atlantic hurricane at 905mbar (hPa; 26.73inHg). The tenth place for most intense Atlantic tropical cyclone is Hurricane Maria listed to have deepened to a pressure as low as 908mbar (hPa; 26.81inHg).|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Gwenda {{was tied}} with Cyclone Inigo for the most intense Australian {{tropical}} cyclone on record, with a <b>barometric</b> <b>pressure</b> of 900hPa (mbar) and was the most intense storm worldwide in 1999. Forming out of a tropical disturbance over the Arafura Sea on 2April 1999, the precursor to Gwenda tracked slowly westward and gradually became more organised. On 4April, the system developed into a Category 1 cyclone and was named Gwenda. It began to undergo explosive intensification the following day, and in a 30-hour span ending early on 7April, the storm's maximum 10-minute sustained wind speed increased from 75km/h (45mph) to 225km/h (140mph) and its <b>barometric</b> <b>pressure</b> decreased to 900hPa (mbar). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported that the storm had peaked as a high-end Category 4 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 India cyclone was {{the second}} strongest {{tropical}} cyclone, in terms of <b>barometric</b> <b>pressure,</b> to form in the Arabian Sea on record; only Cyclone Gonu in 2007 was stronger. The storm originated from a tropical disturbance that formed east of Somalia on May18. Over the following few days, the system gradually organized into a tropical depression. Tracking eastward, towards the coastline of southwestern India, the storm slowly intensified. Shortly before reaching shore, the system turned north and later west, away from land. After taking this turn, the storm intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm, attaining its peak intensity on May24 with winds of 215km/h (135mph 3-minute winds) and a <b>barometric</b> <b>pressure</b> of 932mbar (hPa). At the time, this ranked the cyclone as the strongest known storm in the Arabian Sea.|$|E

5|$|A rare but {{important}} terrain feature {{found in the}} abyssal and hadal zones is the hydrothermal vent. In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C. Due to the high <b>barometric</b> <b>pressure</b> at these depths, water may exist in either its liquid form or as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures.|$|E

Another large gulf low storm was the Great Blizzard of 1978, which brought one of the lowest non-tropical <b>barometric</b> <b>pressures</b> recorded in the United States.|$|R
5|$|Alex was {{the first}} Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{in the month of}} June since Hurricane Allison in 1995, and the strongest in terms of wind speed since Hurricane Alma in 1966. Its <b>barometric</b> <b>pressure</b> recording of 946 mbar (27.96inches) is the most intense from any Atlantic hurricane in June, although Hurricane Audrey in 1957 ties this intensity. Alex is thus tied for the most intense June Atlantic hurricane on record overall. However, as Audrey's pressure was estimated, Audrey's actual pressure might be as low as 925 mbar.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{relatively}} unfavorable vertical {{wind shear}} impacting Colin, deep thunderstorm activity developed atop its center of circulation. Data from a reconnaissance aircraft {{during the afternoon}} hours of August5 revealed that the system reached a peak intensity with winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum <b>barometric</b> <b>pressure</b> of 1005mbar (29.68inHg). A few computer models, namely the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model (HWRF), predicted that Colin would briefly attain hurricane status.|$|E
5|$|Early on September22, an {{aircraft}} fix located Vera 175km (110mi) north-northeast of Saipan. Throughout {{the course of}} the day, periodic reconnaissance flights into the storm indicated that Vera had begun to rapidly intensify. By 1800UTC later that day, data analysis concluded that the tropical cyclone had reached typhoon intensity. Rapid intensification continued into the following day, as the typhoon's maximum sustained winds and <b>barometric</b> <b>pressure</b> quickly rose and fell, respectively. Concurrently, Vera's size grew to a point at which it spanned 250km (155mi) across. At 0600UTC the following day, Vera achieved its minimum estimated <b>barometric</b> <b>pressure</b> at 895mbar (hPa; 26.43inHg). This indicated a 75mbar (hPa; 2.22inHg) pressure drop in the preceding 24hours. Upon reaching its minimum pressure, Vera was estimated to have attained winds equivalent to a Category5– the highest classification possible on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The typhoon's winds continued to increase before peaking at 1200UTC on September23, when reconnaissance aircraft reported maximum sustained winds of 305km/h (190mph). Upon peaking in wind speed, Vera was located 645km (400mi) northeast of Guam. The tropical cyclone's ability to quickly intensify was attributed to conducive atmospheric divergence and highly sustainable sea surface temperatures.|$|E

2500|$|A mid-tropospheric trough persisted {{over the}} western Caribbean Sea in late May. Around that time, a short-wave trough moving eastward through the Caribbean Sea forced a cold front to move southward into the Straits of Florida. Satellite imagery {{indicated}} that the cold front and mid-tropospheric trough began merging as the low-level convergence field increased. Thereafter, <b>barometric</b> <b>pressures</b> in the western Caribbean were decreasing as deep southwesterly flow caused very warm and moist air to enter the area.

Situated over exceedingly cold waters, Fran transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on October12 as it neared the French coastline. Shortly before reaching land, the system was absorbed by a cold front. Throughout its existence, Fran had little effect on land.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, 21 {{tropical}} cyclones {{were observed}} in the western Pacific Ocean, north of the equator. In that region of the world, cyclones that attain maximum sustained winds of at least 118 km/h (74 mph) are known as typhoons. Out of the 21 storms, the Hong Kong Observatory tracked nine of them. The strongest storm, known as the De Witte typhoon, reached a minimum <b>barometric</b> <b>pressure</b> of , before striking eastern China.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of <b>barometric</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> and {{the pressure}} tendency (the change of pressure over time) {{have been used in}} forecasting since the late 19th century.
