5|$|The problem {{occurred}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> {{vehicles were}} modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed {{that although the}} brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on the passenger side. This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both the front passenger and driver could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, {{some of which were}} registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E
5|$|The new route added several locks to the canal, making {{water supply}} {{problems}} more severe. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> system of locks work, water is lost {{from the upper}} part of a canal each time a vessel passes through. This is a particular issue for the pound between Bradford Lock at Bradford on Avon and the Bath Locks, where a series of locks need to be opened each time the gates are opened. Most lock gates are not watertight, therefore some water leaks from the higher levels of the canal to those lower down. The water has to be replaced, or eventually the upper levels of the canal would not hold enough water to be navigable. Canals are usually fed by diverting water from streams and rivers into the upper parts of the canal, but if no suitable source is available or sufficient, a pumping station, such as the one at Claverton, can be used to maintain the water level. Crofton Pumping Station was built to supply water to the summit pound of the canal, opening in 1810 but, unlike Claverton, was powered by steam.|$|E
25|$|The opt-outs {{were only}} {{available}} to listeners on the FM frequencies. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> DAB and digital TV services of Radio 1 are broadcast (a single-frequency network on DAB {{and a single}} broadcast feed of Radio 1 on TV platforms), the digital version of the station was not regionalised.|$|E

25|$|Research in 2003 by Professor Margaret Livingstone of Harvard University {{said that}} Mona Lisa's smile disappears when looked with direct vision, known as foveal. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> human eye {{processes}} visual information, {{it is less}} suited to pick up shadows directly; however, peripheral vision can pick up shadows well.|$|E
25|$|During the series, NHL President John Ziegler {{stated that}} Soviet players {{would never be}} able to join the NHL <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> Soviet hockey {{programme}} worked, and that NHLers {{would never be able}} to play in the Winter Olympics. Soviet players would be allowed to play in the NHL within three years, and an arrangement that would allow NHL players to play in the Olympics was announced within nine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> UV Index is calculated, it {{technically}} {{expresses the}} risk of developing sunburn, which is caused mostly by UVB radiation. However, UVA radiation also causes damage (photoaging, melanoma). Under some conditions, including most tanning beds which generate even higher UV intensities., the UVA level may be disproportionately higher than described by the UV Index. The use of broad-spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreen can help address this concern.|$|E
50|$|His biggest {{influence}} for {{the animation}} world was Mighty Mouse: <b>The</b> New Adventures <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> its animation style differed from that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other 1980s animated series.|$|R
50|$|Critics have {{compared}} the series to Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Community, Review and BoJack Horseman <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it uses meta-humor, absurdist humor {{and how it}} deals with mental health.|$|R
50|$|As of 2010, 470 {{students}} from various communities within LAUSD attend <b>the</b> school. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> racial quotas, 40% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students are White and 60% are {{racial and ethnic}} minorities. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> application process gives favor to residents of other communities, children from Bel-Air generally do not attend the school.|$|R
25|$|Since McLain's 31-win season, {{only two}} other {{pitchers}} have approached the 30-game milestone (Steve Carlton won 27 games in 1972 and Bob Welch also with 27 victories in 1990). With Major League Baseball {{moving from the}} four-man pitching rotation of McLain's era to five-man rotations, and with the increased reliance on relief pitchers, some observers believe that another 30-game winner may not occur <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> game is played today.|$|E
25|$|An {{accurate}} diagnosis may {{be difficult}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> disorder manifests itself. Sufferers may be diagnosed as having similar and perhaps related disorders including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, carpal tunnel syndrome, TMD, Tourette's syndrome, conversion disorder or other neuromuscular movement disorders. It {{has been found that}} the prevalence of dystonia is high in individuals with Huntington's disease, where the most common clinical presentations are internal shoulder rotation, sustained fist clenching, knee flexion, and foot inversion. Risk factors for increased dystonia in patients with Huntington's disease include long disease duration and use of antidopaminergic medication.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, for the 1954 model year, {{the model}} {{underwent}} a major square-lined redesign. This entailed extensive retooling <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> step-down frame {{wrapped around the}} passenger compartment. The front had a simpler grille that complemented the now-functional hood scoop and a new one-piece curved windshield, while the sides gained period-typical fender chrome accents, and the formerly sloped rear end was squared off. The front to rear fender line was styled to make the car look longer and taillamps were also redesigned. The interior was also updated with a new dash and instrument cluster that were surprisingly modern.|$|E
2500|$|General {{relativity}} {{has enjoyed}} much success <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> its predictions <b>of</b> phenomena {{which are not}} called for by <b>the</b> older theory <b>of</b> gravity have been regularly confirmed. [...] For example: ...|$|R
30|$|These fuel-production modules from ecoinvent are disputed to {{some extent}} (see, for instance, [26]), <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> those {{emissions}} are allocated among products. They are used nonetheless, because no better datasets are available.|$|R
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{airframe}} loads {{are distributed}} while operating on rough ground, tailwheel aircraft {{are better able}} to sustain this type of use {{over a long period of}} time, without cumulative airframe damage occurring.|$|R
25|$|While ESAS proved {{profitable}} for Aerotransport and DDL, {{it became a}} burden for DNL. The former two had a much closer overlap between their routes, while DNL had operated without direct competition {{with the other two}} on most of its routes. Instead of coordinating resources, ESAS had become another administrative level; there were also concerns from Norway that administrative and operative staff were leaking to the ESAS head office in Copenhagen and the OSAS head office in Stockholm, without any similar build-up of competence in Norway. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> costs were divided between the pool partners, DNL was also receiving smaller margins that the others.|$|E
25|$|Many Dallas players {{described}} this game {{as the most}} devastating loss of the 1966–1970 period. Having lost this game and the 1966 title game in the waning seconds of each game, Landry was subject to criticism that {{he was unable to}} win the Big One, a stigma that persisted until Dallas won its first NFL title in the 1971 season. In the three seasons following 1967, the Cowboys suffered two upsets in the playoffs to the Cleveland Browns, then lost Super Bowl V to the Baltimore Colts 13–16 on a last-second field goal. Schramm considered this game to be turning point to Dallas becoming America's Team <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> Cowboys battled back in the game.|$|E
25|$|Copeau {{considered}} the aesthetic {{highlight of the}} season Maurice Maeterlinck's Pelléas et Mélisande, principally <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> unit set with subtle lighting and the judicious use of banners on its several levels allowed an uninterrupted flow of action in this major work of the Symbolist movement. However, the dispute between Copeau and {{several members of the}} company led to their dismissal by the end of January, most important amongst them one of the premier actors, Dullin. The season ended with an Impromptu, during which {{all the members of the}} troupe who remained played short scenes representing their major portrayals. At the end of the presentation, all the costumes were placed in the wicker baskets marked with the two doves representing the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier.|$|E
25|$|Jim Thompson {{has been}} cited by Norwegian crime novelist Jo Nesbø as being a major {{influence}} on his style <b>of</b> writing, particularly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which he described the human mind and nature.|$|R

50|$|His {{collection}} Lands Without for Spring/Summer 1997 featured several “Kite” dresses, {{which were}} notable <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{in which he}} directed the relationship between his garments and the body, and his use of architectural proportions to amplify their interplay with their surroundings.|$|R
25|$|During the afternoon, {{the chief}} petty {{officers}} and petty officers {{were asked to}} confirm {{that they would not}} join the mutineers. Although they expressed similar concerns as the sailors (and <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> pay rates scaled for higher enlisted ranks, were worse off than before), and did not agree with the handling of the mutiny by the RNZN and the government, they all agreed to remain on duty. Over the following days, another 20 personnel who were sick or otherwise not present on 3 April applied to be discharged under similar conditions to the mutineers. Six were discharged: some were sailors whose previous application for demobilisation had been refused, the rest showed good reasons for ending their service on compassionate grounds.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Sports Illustrated {{said that}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> Astros put {{together}} their team, they {{would win the}} 2017 World Series. As of June 9, the Astros were 41–16, which gave them a 13.5-game lead {{over the rest of}} their division, and they had comfortable possession of {{the best record in the}} entire league. This is the best start in the 55 years of the Astros' existence. As the games of June 23 concluded, the Astros had an 11.5-game lead over the rest of the division. The Astros entered the All-Star Break with an American League best 60–29 record and a 16 game lead in the division, although the overall best record in MLB had just barely slipped to the Dodgers shortly before the All-Star Break by just one game.|$|E
500|$|On February 8, 2007, a visibly upset Laurer {{appeared}} on Larry King Live {{to speak about}} her friend, Anna Nicole Smith, who had died earlier that day. On the program, Laurer claimed that she [...] "knew it was coming" [...] <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> media had ridiculed Smith, and she drew parallels between the plight of Anna and herself. The wife of the CEO of Trim Spa, Monique Goen, however, claimed that Smith did not consider Laurer a friend.|$|E

2500|$|It was a long-held {{belief that}} Guiteau himself wrote the folk song [...] "Charles Guiteau".

500|$|Conversely, Noel Murray of The Onions The A.V. Club graded [...] "Snakehead" [...] with a B+, {{explaining}} {{the focus on}} Walter was a [...] "smart choice by the Fringe team thematically". Murray continued, [...] "Ordinarily I'd be griping that this episode was yet another mythology-free time-waster, with a plot that—two-foot-long parasites aside—could be passed along to any other procedural show currently on the air. But I really enjoyed 'Snakehead,' both <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> story reflected who Walter is and {{because of all the}} little touches of character development and scene-setting.|$|E
500|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> HST's {{instruments}} were designed, two {{different sets of}} correctors were required. The design of the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2, already planned to replace the existing WF/PC, included relay mirrors to direct light onto the four separate charge-coupled device (CCD) chips making up its two cameras. [...] An inverse error built into their surfaces could completely cancel the aberration of the primary. However, the other instruments lacked any intermediate surfaces that could be figured in this way, and so required an external correction device.|$|E
500|$|In America Epstein {{had met the}} {{well-known}} divorce lawyer, Nat Weiss, whom Epstein later asked {{to take over the}} merchandising affairs of the Beatles and NEMS. Weiss would later state, [...] "The reality is that the Beatles never saw a penny out of the merchandising... Tens of millions of dollars went down the drain <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> whole thing was mishandled. Even after the judgement was vacated, you could smell the smoke from the ashes, that's how badly they had been burned." [...] Beatles' memorabilia, licensed by Seltaeb, is still sold at Beatles' conventions and on the internet.|$|E
50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{dataflow}} variables work, it {{is possible}} to put threads anywhere in a program and guaranteed that it will have the same result.
