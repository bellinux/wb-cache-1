25|$|During the screening, people <b>began</b> <b>walking</b> out; Goodman {{thought the}} film was bombing, until {{he learned that the}} viewers were {{actually}} leaving because they were so frightened.

When {{the film was}} taken in by Paramount, several changes were made. Some scenes were cut, others added, and the original ending was scrapped, with two new endings being shot.
