500|$|I {{finally got}} tired of making movies where all I did was walk across the screen and look pretty. I got a big chance to do some real acting in The Postman Always Rings Twice, and I'm not going to slip back if I can help it. I tried to persuade the studio to give me {{something}} different. <b>But</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> went into my argument about how bad a picture was, they'd say, [...] "well, it's making a fortune". That licked me.|$|E
500|$|Shel Talmy, the {{producer}} on the track, {{has gone on}} record and put the controversy to rest {{in an interview with}} The Guardian, saying [...] "contrary to myth, Jimmy didn't play on 'You Really Got Me'." [...] In a 7 November 2014 interview with SiriusXM's Town Hall series, Page confirmed again that he did not play on the song, saying [...] "Oh, Crikey! I wasn't on 'You Really Got Me,' but I did play on the Kinks' records. That's all I'm going to say about it. <b>But</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> do an interview, people ask me about 'You Really Got Me.'

50|$|I didn't {{have any}} words! Then people {{said it was}} 'lie' but I didn't really mean that. That it was a lie. But, it's not a failure of songwriting, because people like that and they put enough meaning into it, {{and the rest of}} the song has enough power and emotion, I guess, to make it go, so it's all right. <b>But</b> for me, <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> sing that part... softly, I'm a little embarrassed.|$|R

Several years after she left the show as a recurring character, B. J. Novak wanted to write her a cameo in the seventh season episode [...] "Threat Level Midnight", but she was unavailable for filming. [...] "Hot Girl" [...] {{was one of two}} first season episodes, the other being [...] "Health Care", that did not contain commentary by members of the cast and crew on the season DVD.|$|E

In February 1987 he joined Dylan, John Fogerty and Jesse Ed Davis on stage for a two-hour performance with the blues musician Taj Mahal. Harrison recalled: [...] "Bob rang me up and asked if I wanted to come out for the evening and see Taj Mahal... So we went there and had a few of these Mexican beers – and had a few more... Bob says, 'Hey, why don't we all get up and play, and you can sing?' <b>But</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> got near the microphone, Dylan comes up and just starts singing this rubbish in my ear, trying to throw me." ...|$|E
60|$|Whenever I went {{in or out}} of the hut, {{for three}} long months, that hideous thing stood there staring me in the face with mute indignation. At night, when I tried to sleep, the murdered man stood there still in the {{darkness}} beside me. O God! I dared not say a word to anybody: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> trembled <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> passed it, and I knew what {{it was to be a}} murderer.|$|R
5000|$|Brad Keselowski {{scored the}} pole {{for the race}} {{with a time of}} 27.881 and a speed of 193.680 mph. When asked how he {{accomplished}} this despite missing his mark in Turns 1 and 2 on his pole lap, he said he didn't [...] "know what the answer is. I'll have to look through a bunch of data, and the smart guys -- the engineers and crew chiefs -- will probably point some of that stuff out to me. <b>But,</b> yeah, <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> looked at the tracker, the cars that were fast in 1 and 2 weren't in 3 and 4, and we were the opposite. We were really good in 3 and 4… but we'll take it either way." ...|$|R
6000|$|When I awoke I found Dian {{sitting in}} the doorway looking out across the valley. As I came out she moved to one side to let me pass, {{but she had no}} word for me. I wanted to hate her, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> couldn't. <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> looked at her {{something}} came up in my throat, so that I nearly choked. I had never been in love before, but I did not need any aid in diagnosing my case--I certainly had it and had it bad. God, how I loved that beautiful, disdainful, tantalizing, prehistoric girl! ...|$|R
500|$|On his casting in {{the role}} of Fatboy, {{television}} newcomer Ricky Norwood said, [...] "It's an honour to now be a part of [...] show. I am born and bred in the East End [...] it feels like a homecoming." [...] Norwood adapted his own use of slang into the character to [...] "try and bring it and from a true place." [...] Bunmi Mojekwu, who plays Mercy Olubunmi, commented [...] "I feel so blessed to be part of EastEnders: E20. My first day on set was just crazy. I was on Albert Square – a dream come true – I'm enjoying every second." [...] Sam Attwater, who previously appeared in five episodes of Hollyoaks, was cast as boxer Leon Small. On his casting, he commented, [...] "It's a great privilege to be working with such great actors and on such an established show. It's an amazing opportunity and I'm really enjoying tackling a character like Leon who has so much going on," [...] He prepared for the role by attending a gym, as the character has a lot of topless scenes. He said: [...] "As soon as I heard that I was straight down the gym. Lots of crunches. Everyone said don't worry about it, <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> did one of those scenes I had to watch it back and see how it looked because there will be 10 million people watching it. I {{want to be on the}} best form." ...|$|E
2500|$|About {{the picture}} and its legacy, Lorrie Stirm Kitching once noted, [...] "We have this very nice picture of a very happy moment, <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> look at it, I {{remember}} the families that weren't reunited, {{and the ones that}} aren't being reunited today— many, many families— and I think, I'm one of the lucky ones." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an October 2007 {{preliminary}} hearing {{for the case}} of Dr. Maurice Wolin, Dr. Wolin's attorney Blair Berk argued that Perverted Justice's founder has a financial incentive to badger suspects. Von Erck testified in the hearing that he is paid an annual salary of $120,000 stemming from Perverted Justice's deal with NBC. Said Berk, [...] "Xavier Von Erck had a problem. He had a television show to get on and a fancy cancer doctor to ensnare in his web, and he wouldn't let it go." [...] The prosecutor in the case, Brian Staebell, stated, [...] "The whole business of this {{preliminary hearing}} has been {{an attack on the}} Petaluma Police Department and Perverted Justice. <b>But</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> go back to the chats and I look at how he was grooming this 13-year-old girl." [...] After the hearing, Judge Raima Ballinger held Wolin over for trial, ruling that there was sufficient cause to believe Wolin committed the crime.|$|E
500|$|The {{tributes to}} Stengel upon his death were many. Maury Allen wrote, [...] "He {{is gone and}} I am {{supposed}} to cry, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> laugh. <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> saw the man, <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> heard his voice, <b>every</b> <b>time</b> his name was mentioned, the creases in my mouth would give way and a smile would come to my face." [...] Richie Ashburn, {{a member of the}} 1962 Mets, stated, [...] "Don't shed any tears for Casey. He wouldn't want you to... He was the happiest man I've ever seen." [...] Jim Murray of the Los Angeles Times [...] wrote, [...] "God is certainly getting an earful tonight." ...|$|R
2500|$|Fox hired Terry Erdmann (Blue Blaze {{code name}} [...] "Silver Fox") {{and a team}} of publicists {{including}} Blake Mitchell and Jim Ferguson to promote the film at Star Trek conventions with a few film clips and free Banzai headbands, which have since become highly sought-after collector's items by fans of the film. The studio made no attempts to sell the film to a mainstream audience with traditional promotion, although there was some magazine advertising (primarily in Marvel Comics) and related licensing which served as viral advertising in limited venues. Studio publicist Rosemary LaSalmandra said, [...] "Nobody knew what to do with Buckaroo Banzai. There was no simple way to tell anyone what it was about—I'm not sure anybody knew". Lithgow said, [...] "I've tried to explain the story line to people and it takes about an hour. I mean it; it's that complicated. <b>But</b> it's terrific. <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> tell people about it, I get so excited that I end it by saying, Buckaroo Banzai, remember where you heard it first!" ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{hate to be}} {{reminded}} of Pollok's [...] "Course of Time," [...] and so do you; <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> saw Jacks I would think of the poet's description of another poet by the name of G.

For four hours nothing happened, and not a word said, except that now and then she said, 'Keep it up, Boy, keep it up, sweetheart; we'll save him!' I kept it up. Well, when the dark shut down, in the rugged hills, that poor little chap had been tearing around in the saddle all day, and I noticed by the slack knee-pressure that she was tired and tottery, and I got dreadfully afraid; <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> tried {{to slow down and}} let her go to sleep, so I could stop, she hurried me up again; and so, sure enough, at last over she went! ...|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless I came safely away, a neater, {{older and}} graver person, {{walking with a}} manlier stride, and when I confronted my classmates at the Grove school-house on Sunday, I gave {{evidence}} of an accession of self-confidence.

If only my trousers had not continued their distressing habit of climbing up my boot-tops I would have been almost at ease <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> rose from my seat it became necessary to make each instep smooth the leg of the other pantaloon, and even then they kept their shameful wrinkles, and a knowledge of my exposed ankles humbled me.|$|E

60|$|There was {{something}} about Hotoo-Otoo that struck my fancy; and I registered a vow to plant my foot upon its soil, notwithstanding an old bareheaded sentry menaced me in the moonlight with an unsightly musket. As my canoe drew scarcely three inches of water, I could paddle close up to the parapet without grounding; <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> came near, the old man ran toward me, pushing his piece forward, but never clapping it to his shoulder. Thinking he only meant to frighten me, I at last dashed the canoe right Up to the wall, purposing a leap. It was the rashest act of my life; for never did cocoa-nut come nearer getting demolished than mine did then. With the stock of his gun, the old warder fetched a tremendous blow, which I managed to dodge; and then falling back, succeeded in paddling out of harm's reach.|$|E
