25|$|<b>Buckie</b> and Portessie Branch - {{another line}} requisitioned in World War I and never re-opened.|$|E
25|$|The {{line between}} Keith to Highland's <b>Buckie</b> station closed in 1915 and only goods traffic used {{the line from}} <b>Buckie</b> to Portessie. Locomotive repairs fell behind because of the {{excessive}} demands {{and many of the}} engine fitters had been called up for war service. Twenty locomotives were loaned from other railways; efforts to get engine fitters failed. 756 of the 3000 Highland Railway staff served active service and a memorial to 87 that died was placed in Station Square at Inverness. The railways were in a poor state after the war, costs having increased, with higher wages, the introduction of an eight-hour day and the price of coal having risen. A scheme was devised whereby the railways would be grouped into four large companies; this was approved by Parliament as the Railways Act 1921.|$|E
500|$|A {{bill was}} {{introduced}} to parliament in 1881 to extend the line from Portsoy along the Moray Firth to <b>Buckie,</b> to be opposed by the Highland and rejected. The following year both the Great North and Highland railways applied to parliament, the Great North for a [...] line from Portsoy along the coast through <b>Buckie</b> to Elgin, and the Highland for a branch from Keith to <b>Buckie</b> and Cullen. Authority was granted, {{but in the case}} of the Highland Railway only for a line as far as Portessie, with running rights over the Great North coast line between <b>Buckie</b> and Portsoy and the Great North obtaining reciprocal rights over the Highland railway between Elgin and Forres. The coast line opened in stages, the outer sections from Portsoy to Tochieneal and Elgin to Garmouth opening in 1884. The centre section, which involved heavy engineering, with a long viaduct with a central span of [...] over the Spey at Garmouth and embankments and viaducts at Cullen, opened in May 1886. The line was served by four trains a day and a fast through train from Aberdeen that reached Elgin in [...] hours. The Highland Portessie branch had opened in 1884 and the Highland did not exercise its running rights over the Coast Line, thus preventing the Great North running over its lines west of Elgin.|$|E

When he was 14, Orsborne lied about his age and enlisted as a Boy Seaman in the Royal Navy; in his memoirs he wrote: [...] "I never did have an adolescence". He served in the Dover Patrol, and was wounded during the 1918 Zeebrugge Raid. After leaving the Navy in December 1919 and working ashore for a brief period, he was persuaded by a former captain of the Cutty Sark, Captain Wilkins, {{to go back to}} sea. He joined the merchant navy, sailing mainly in small ships based in Liverpool.|$|E

2500|$|In 1881 the GNoSR {{applied to}} Parliament {{to extend the}} line from Portsoy along the Moray Firth to <b>Buckie,</b> but this was {{rejected}} after the Highland opposed.

In the early sixties the Town Council, which had maintained both Buckpool and <b>Buckie’s</b> other course Strathlene decided to close Buckpool due to economic reasons. A group of enthusiasts formed a private club and leased the course which {{has come a long way}} from the old farmhouse which was the clubhouse to the present building situated besides the 10th and 18th greens.

It extends to a length of about fourteen hundred feet, but the part of it discovered at low water to not more than four hundred and twenty-seven. At {{a little more than}} half-flood in fine weather the seamless ocean joins over the reef, and at high-water springs it is buried sixteen feet. As the tide goes down, the higher reaches of the rock are seen to be clothed by Conferva rupestris as by a sward of grass; upon the more exposed edges, where the currents are most swift and the breach of the sea heaviest, Baderlock or Henware flourishes; and the great Tangle grows at the depth of several fathoms with luxuriance. Before man arrived, and introduced into the silence of the sea the smoke and clangour of a blacksmith's shop, it was a favourite resting-place of seals.

Unfortunately in one of the earlier books on Scottish place names <b>Buckie</b> on the Moray Firth does not receive a mention although <b>Buckie,</b> spelt the same way, in the Balquhidder district of Perthshire is described as being derived from the Gaelic word boc or Welsh bowk, both meaning a buck or male deer so this would suggest the meaning of <b>Buckie</b> as place where male deer gather and this specifically would most likely have been the valley of what is known today as the <b>Buckie</b> Burn.|$|E
