40|$|Advanced {{composite}} materials, {{which are}} increasingly being used to build aircraft, have different properties than the metals they replace. Fasteners intended for composite-material joints must be designed and selected to allow for these differences. For example, blind fasteners (one-sided access) used to assemble composite-to-composite joints have been redesigned to expand to larger diameters to resist pull-through and cocking failures. The fastener designs needed for composite materials are reviewed. Topics discussed are: galvanic corrosion, pull-through resistance, fastener rotation, installation damage, fastener galling and conductivity. A <b>blind</b> <b>fastener</b> recently developed by SPS Technologies is described to show how these requirements are incorporated...|$|E
50|$|By the 1950s {{the company}} was {{focusing}} on providing new value added assembly solutions, this “systems” approach created greater optimisation and provided customers with a single source for dependable fasteners and installation equipment. In 1961 {{the company was}} renamed 'Avdel' and substantial growth throughout {{the next two decades}} saw it become one of the world's largest manufacturers of <b>blind</b> <b>fasteners</b> and installation tools. Expansion of the group was most significant in the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s with several new facilities established in Europe, USA and the Asia Pacific region.|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes and evaluates a {{non-destructive}} {{method in}} assessing the quality of blind-fastener installations. The method is based on combining the time of flight of an ultrasonic pulse along the pin of the fastener and the fastener installation time. The former has to be measured after the fastening process; the latter has to be acquired at the machine during the fastening. The tests performed on carbon fibre reinforced plastic laminates joined by means of ABS 0257 <b>blind</b> <b>fasteners</b> have proved that the method can distinguish incorrectly installed fasteners due to improper grip selection. The hit rate of the developed non-destructive method is above 95 % for the tested range of fastener sizes. The implementation of this method might prevent the use of extra fasteners, currently required, in order {{to compensate for the}} uncertainty of blind-fastener installation...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{introduce}} a kernel density-based pattern classification approach for the automatic identification of behavioral patterns from monitoring data related to <b>blind</b> <b>fasteners</b> installation. High density regions are estimated from feature space to establish behavioral patterns, automatically removing outliers and noisy instances in an iterative process. First the kernel density estimator is applied on the fastener features representing {{the quality of}} the installation. Then the behavioral patterns are identified from resulting high density regions, also considering the proximity between instances. Patterns are computed as the average of related monitoring torque-rotation diagrams. New fastening installations can be thus automatically classified in an online fashion. In order to show the validity of the approach, experiments have been conducted on real fastening data. Experimental results show an accurate pattern identification and classification approach, obtaining a global accuracy over 78 % and improving current detection capabilities and existing evaluation systems...|$|R
40|$|The need {{to provide}} {{mechanical}} connection from one side for the Hollow section connection has arisen {{in a number of}} fields and has resulted in the development of several types of so-called <b>blind</b> <b>fasteners.</b> An experimental <b>blind</b> bolt called the Extended Hollobolt is giving a good behaviour performance in terms of stiffness, strength and ductility. The strength performance of this system has been investigated under both monotonic and cyclic loading. However, the performance of such connections under fatigue loading is still unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the behaviour of blind bolt connection to concrete filled hollow section under repeated load. Further aim was to determine the reliability of the Extended Hollobolt to concrete filled hollow section. The study involved conducting an experimental programme and carrying out fatigue life and reliability analysis. The experiment programme tested 52 specimens of bolts connected to concrete filled hollow sections where 36 tests involved Extended Hollobolt, 10 standard Hollobolt and 6 standard bolts (M 16). The test specimens were subjected to tensile fatigue load characteristics with varying stress ranges. Mathematical methods are used to analyse the fatigue test data using the normal, lognormal and Weibull distributions. Normal and lognormal distributions are more suitable. Therefore, statistical analysis procedure proposed by Eurocode for the statistical analysis is valid for fatigue test data. Statistical analysis was conducted to establish S-N curves and to predict the fatigue life of the proposed blind bolt. This was then compared to the normative regulation in Eurocode 3. The failure mode of the Extended Hollobolt under repeated loading was found to be similar with standard bolt, which is a very positive outcome. Statistical analysis of fatigue test data showed that the fatigue life of Extended Hollobolt is higher than the theoretical design S-N curve which is recommended by Eurocode 3 part 1 - 9 for the standard bolt. However, the actual fatigue life for the standard bolt appears to be higher than the proposed blind bolt. A design model for predicting the fatigue life using S-N curve for the Extended Hollobolt is proposed. A reliability analysis using FORM (First Order Reliability Method) analysis shows that Extended Hollobolt is reliable in connections to concrete filled hollow sections where the safety index is 4. 2...|$|R
