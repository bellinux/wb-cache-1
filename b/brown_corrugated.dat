Hem!" ...|$|E

5000|$|The Thunderdome {{was built}} in 1979, {{originally}} {{under the name of}} Campus Events Center. Along with Harder Stadium, it has since {{become one of the most}} patronized venues at UC Santa Barbara. After a naming contest and vote among students and faculty (which included some tongue in cheek nominations such as [...] "Yankee Stadium", the Jerry <b>Brown</b> Arena, the <b>Corrugated</b> Fortress), it was eventually given the generic name [...] "Campus Events Center". Eventually, the name was unofficially shorted to the [...] "ECen" [...] (much like UCSB's University Center being called the [...] "UCen").|$|R
50|$|Fruit Ripens {{during the}} autumn into a fruit (nut) with a brownish-green, semifleshy husk and a <b>brown,</b> <b>corrugated</b> nut. The whole fruit, {{including}} the husk falls in October or November; the seed {{is relatively small}} and very hard.|$|E
5000|$|Sarah Pocket, {{the sister}} of Matthew Pocket, {{relative}} of Miss Havisham. She is often at Satis House. She is described as [...] "a dry, <b>brown</b> <b>corrugated</b> old woman, with a small face {{that might have been}} made out of walnut shells, and a large mouth like a cat's without the whiskers." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{workshops}} {{are located}} {{to the northeast}} of the pithead. They comprise two gabled sheds attached to each other. A tramline runs into {{the western side of}} the mechanical workshop. This is a <b>brown,</b> <b>corrugated</b> iron building. Two large hinged doors, clad in corrugated iron, provide rail access through the western side. A wooden door opens to the south of this. A second wooden door opens on the opposite side. The building has no windows.|$|E
50|$|The bark {{is black}} to <b>brown,</b> <b>corrugated</b> or fissured, and scaly, {{fissuring}} in a characteristic rectangular pattern. The leaves are alternate, simple, 8-20 cm long, elliptical, bluntly or acutely pointed, glabrous, and dark green above, pale green below, with mildly serrated margins. A central vein is depressed on top, prominent on the bottom. The 2 cm petiole is pink or red. The flowers are androgynous, 10-20 stamens, insect-pollinated, 3-8 cm, greenish white or buff, and are distributed in 70 mm axillary racemes. The plant flowers October through May. The fruit is a drupe, red to brown, 7-13 mm, wider than long, two-lobed, with a seed in each lobe. It grows in bunches ripening September through November, {{several months after}} pollination.|$|E
50|$|Flexo has an {{advantage}} over lithography in that it can use {{a wider range of}} inks, water based rather than oil based inks, and is good at printing on a variety of different materials like plastic, foil, acetate film, brown paper, and other materials used in packaging. Typical products printed using flexography include <b>brown</b> <b>corrugated</b> boxes, flexible packaging including retail and shopping bags, food and hygiene bags and sacks, milk and beverage cartons, flexible plastics, self-adhesive labels, disposable cups and containers, envelopes and wallpaper. In recent years there has also been a move towards laminates, where two or more materials are bonded together to produce new material with different properties than either of the originals. A number of newspapers now eschew the more common offset lithography process in favour of flexo. Flexographic inks, like those used in gravure and unlike those used in lithography, generally have a low viscosity. This enables faster drying and, as a result, faster production, which results in lower costs.|$|E
50|$|The bark is smooth, olive-brown {{when young}} and silvery-grey on older branches, and {{features}} scattered broad fissures with a rougher texture. Like all walnuts, the pith of the twigs contains air spaces; this chambered pith is brownish in color. The leaves are alternately arranged, 25-40 cm (10 to 16 in) long, odd-pinnate with 5-9 leaflets, paired alternately with one terminal leaflet. The largest leaflets {{are the three}} at the apex, 10-18 cm (4 to 7 in) long and 6-8 cm (2 to 3 in) broad; the basal pair of leaflets are much smaller, 5-8 cm (2 to 3 in) long, with {{the margins of the}} leaflets entire. The male flowers are in drooping catkins 5-10 cm (2 to 4 in) long, and the female flowers are terminal, in clusters of two to five, ripening in the autumn into a fruit with a green, semifleshy husk and a <b>brown,</b> <b>corrugated</b> nut. The whole fruit, including the husk, falls in autumn; the seed is large, with a relatively thin shell, and edible, with a rich flavour.|$|E
50|$|Activities CenterThe Activities Center was {{the only}} {{building}} constructed {{on the north side}} of West 12th Street. Designed by the Des Moines architectural firm of Frevent, Ramsey & Dray, it was constructed by Priester Construction Company in 1978. The 225 by 192 ft single-story structure followed a T-shaped plan. Unlike all of the other buildings on the Marycrest campus, its exterior is covered with <b>brown</b> <b>corrugated</b> steel. It features a broad gable that faces the street. The roof over the gymnasium portion of the building is also corrugated steel. The facility housed four combination basketball/volleyball/tennis courts, an ⅛-mile jogging track, a fitness center, and the student center. The larger gymnasium section is joined to a smaller wing off of the east side that housed offices. It is faced with mottled tan and brown brick over concrete block on the lower portion of the walls and corrugated steel above. The office wing is divided into three bays, and it is capped by a shed roof that extends along the south side. The recessed main entrance is located in the center bay. The building continues to house a sports complex known as Beyond The Baseline.|$|E
50|$|While in Troms, in 1952 she {{designed}} {{an experimental}} house for herself on Mellomveien. Typically for Sand, the layout is centred {{on a large}} kitchen which forms part of the open living-room area. It is closely connected to a laundry room and pantry with outdoor firewood storage within easy reach. It was therefore unnecessary for the house to have a cellar and could thus be built at a reasonable cost. It was also particularly suited {{to the needs of}} a housewife or female occupant. Kirsten Sand's house is situated on the southeast side of Tromsøya, approximately 2.5 km south of the city centre. It was built as a demonstration of a light wooden platform construction. It was imperative during the post World War 2 reconstruction effort to use as few and light materials as possible. Once completed the house was open to the general public several Sundays on a row. Kirsten Sand also designed the plan for the neighbouring area with roads following the contour of the landscape and detached houses positioned to get optimal sunlight.It is a relatively small and simple house with two floors and an attic. At the northern end is a one storey extension containing storage rooms. <b>Brown</b> <b>corrugated</b> fibre cement sheeting covers the two roofs and the wooden cladding is ochre with blue window surrounds and frames. To the east the house has a smaller extension with large windows and exit to the garden as well as two other characteristic bay windows. In 2017 this house was declared a protected landmark by the Tromsø municipality.|$|E
40|$|Four-month old {{containerized}} cork-oak seedlings {{grown in}} nursery with different root conditioning were planted in a fenced area near Évora, southern Portugal. The effects of six precondioning root treatments and two different treeshelters on the survival and growth were evaluated {{seven years after}} plantation. Pre-planting root treatments, consisting in the combination of three different containers and two different substrates did not clearly affect survival but plants grown {{with a mixture of}} ground pine bark and vermiculite grew better than plants which received a superfosphate enriched mixture of soil and peat. Different shelters affect differently both survival and growth of the plants. The 1. 20 m high, translucent light <b>brown</b> <b>corrugated</b> polypropylene shelter (Sheltatree) did not significantly affect survival, increased growth in height but trunk growth in diameter was delayed in comparison with non sheltered plants. The 0. 75 cm high transparent PVC shelter (Gro-Cone) had no effects on height and significantly reduced trunk radial growth as well as plant survival but only when compared with the other shelter. The use of treeshelters appears as a promising technique which, depending on the local conditions, may conciliate the multiple use of the montado with cork-oak regeneration. The use of a seedling growth substrate like ground pine bark revealed high potential for plant growth in the usually nutrient scarce soils of cork-oak stands...|$|E
