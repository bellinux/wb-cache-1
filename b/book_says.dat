It gives considerable detail on business matters, and does question some of O'Reilly's assertions, notably about his Irish business interests. It also gives much detail on O'Reilly's parents' situations and especially his father's family, detail which the author notes even O'Reilly did not have until the book gathered it, and includes some fine detail about his residences.|$|E

500|$|Harald was not {{affected}} by Maniakes' conflict with Michael IV, and received honours and respect upon his return to Constantinople. In a Greek book written in the 1070s, the Strategikon of Kekaumenos, Araltes (i.e. Harald) {{is said to have}} won the favour of the emperor. The <b>book</b> <b>says</b> that the Byzantine emperor first appointed him manglabites (possibly identified with the title protospatharios), a soldier of the imperial guard, after the Sicilian campaign. Following the campaign against the Bulgarians, in which Harald again served with distinction, he received the rank while at Mosynopolis of spatharokandidatos, identified by DeVries as a promotion to the possibly third highest Byzantine rank, but by Mikhail Bibikov as a lesser rank than protospatharios that was ordinarily awarded to foreign allies to the emperor. The Strategikon indicates that the ranks awarded to Harald were rather low, since Harald reportedly was [...] "not angry for just having been appointed to manglabites or spatharokandidatos". According to his skald Tjodolv Arnorsson, Harald had participated in eighteen greater battles during his Byzantine service. Harald's favour at the imperial court quickly declined after the death of Michael IV in December 1041, which was followed by conflicts between the new emperor Michael V and the powerful empress Zoe.|$|E

500|$|During {{the past}} century, the fictitious diary has {{developed}} as an accepted means of comedic expression; the original has, says Morton, [...] "been fertile ground which has germinated many seeds". An early example is Anita Loos's novel of 1925: [...] {{in which the}} protagonist, Lorelei Lee, records her flirtatious adventure in prose that [...] "follows the mannerisms of colloquial speech" [...] and suggests innocence or ignorance yet, the critic Elyse Graham observes, [...] "burlesques, in excoriating detail, the vernacular of the American middle class". [...] The diary genre became particularly popular in the late 20th century. In 1978–81 Christopher Matthew produced three volumes of diaries recording the daily life of [...] "Simon Crisp", a bachelor would-be man-about town of the era. The title of the first, The Diary of a Somebody, is a direct reference to the Grossmith original. Reviewing this volume in The Spectator, Benny Green points out several parallels with the original, in both character and event. Matthew's <b>book,</b> <b>says</b> Green, is amusing, but the Grossmiths' book is superior; it is [...] "affecting as well as comical, {{in a way that}} the Matthew pastiche is not". In 1982 came the first appearance of Sue Townsend's teenage creation, Adrian Mole, whose passage into young manhood and early middle age is charted in a long series of diaries. The more middle-aged he becomes, says Morton, the more he resembles Pooter.|$|E
500|$|Many {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} suggest that the mysteries of Isis were connected {{in some way to}} salvation and the guarantee of an afterlife. The Greek conception of the afterlife included the paradisiacal Elysian Fields, and philosophers developed various ideas about the immortality of the soul, but Greeks and Romans expressed uncertainty about what would happen to them after death. In both Greek and Roman traditional religion, no god was thought to guarantee a pleasant afterlife to his or her worshippers. The gods of some mystery cults may have been exceptions, but evidence about those cults' afterlife beliefs is vague. Apuleius's account, if it is accurate, provides stronger evidence for Isiac afterlife beliefs than is available for the other cults. The <b>book</b> <b>says</b> Isis's power over fate, which her Greek and Roman devotees frequently mentioned, gives her control over life and death. According to the priest who initiates Lucius, devotees of Isis [...] "who had finished their life's span and were already standing on the threshold of light’s end, if only they could safely be trusted with the great unspoken mysteries of the cult, were frequently drawn forth by the goddess' power and in a manner reborn through her providence and set once more on the course of renewed life." [...] In another passage, Isis herself says that when Lucius dies {{he will be able to}} see her shining in the darkness of the underworld and worship her there.|$|E
500|$|Biographers {{describe}} Rutherford as {{tall and}} solidly built with a senatorial demeanor, {{and a strong}} booming voice that helped make him a powerful orator. In 1917, The New York Times stated that Rutherford [...] "has a reputation as an eloquent, forceful speaker". Watch Tower Society literature states that his personality contrasted strongly with that of his predecessor. One Witness history <b>book</b> <b>says</b> that while Russell was kind, warm and tactful, Rutherford [...] "was warm and generous toward his associates {{but he was also}} a brusque and direct type of person, and his legal background and experiences in early life gave him a directness in his approach to problems in dealing with his brothers that caused some to take offense." [...] Another Watch Tower Society account says he did not hide his feelings, adding, [...] "His bluntness, even when spoken in kindness, was sometimes misunderstood." [...] Fellow Watch Tower Society director A. H. Macmillan says Rutherford [...] "spoke as simply and directly to the people as he knew how, and he was an extremely forthright man. He was thoroughly convinced that {{what he had to say}} was the truth and that it was a matter of life and death." [...] Macmillan added, [...] "He would never tolerate anything that would be contrary to what he clearly understood the Bible to teach. He was so strict about that, he would permit nothing that would seem to show a compromise when it came to an issue of the truth." [...] Author Tony Wills describes him as charitable and generous, and says his sympathy for the poor and oppressed was exceeded only by his hatred for the rich, the oppressors. Wills also notes that he was a dynamic, impatient extrovert. Other authors also address Rutherford's abrasiveness: James Penton describes him as blunt and moody with an explosive temper, with [...] "a streak of self-righteousness which caused him to regard anyone who opposed him as of the Devil", while Alan Rogerson notes that he was a [...] "dogmatic and insensitive person, obsessed with his own self-importance." ...|$|E

[...] Kristin Ramsdell, of Library Journal, {{reviewed the}} <b>book</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Lively pacing, zingy dialog, and Piggy's hilarious internal monologs are just the things to lighten the winter blues for readers who like their contemporaries on the sassy, slightly paranormal side. Carmichael has written numerous historical and contemporary romances and lives in Arizona." [...] Maria Hatton, of Booklist, reviewed the <b>book</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Carmichael's spunky canine hero will win even more admirers in this terrifically funny and captivating installment in her ongoing adventures.|$|R

2500|$|Persistently {{embracing}} sin {{is considered}} the same as rejecting the leadings of the Adjuster, rejecting the will of God.
