40|$|This report {{addresses}} modulation and synchronization {{techniques for}} a multi-frequency time {{division multiple access}} (MF-TDMA) system with onboard baseband processing. The types of synchronization techniques analyzed are asynchronous (conventional) TDMA, preambleless asynchronous TDMA, <b>bit</b> synchronous <b>timing</b> with a preamble, and preambleless <b>bit</b> synchronous <b>timing.</b> Among these alternatives, preambleless <b>bit</b> synchronous <b>timing</b> simplifies onboard multicarrier demultiplexer/demodulator designs (about 2 : 1 reduction in mass and power), requires smaller onboard buffers (10 : 1 to approximately 3 : 1 reduction in size), and provides better frame efficiency as well as lower onboard processing delay. Analysis and computer simulation illustrate that this technique can support a bit rate of up to 10 Mbit/s (or higher) with proper selection of design parameters. High bit rate transmission may require Doppler compensation and multiple phase error measurements. The recommended modulation technique for <b>bit</b> synchronous <b>timing</b> is coherent QPSK with differential encoding for the uplink and coherent QPSK for the downlink...|$|R

The data link layer standard is responsible for fully specifying how messages are assembled ready for transmission by the physical layer, error handling, message-filtering and bus arbitration and how these standards are to be implemented in hardware. The application layer standard, in general defines how the data communication layers are interfaced to the application that wishes to communicate. It describes message specifications, network management implementations and response to the request from the application of services. Layers three to six are not described in fieldbus standards.|$|E

It is not true that phase shifts larger than 90 deg will necessarily be corrected by this bit synchronizer. However, the specifications currently require the loop to operate over only a + or - 75 deg phase shift between the received data stream leading edges and the bit synchronizer leading edges; consequently, {{there should be no}} problem...|$|E

The resolution of the A/D conversion is twenty-four <b>bits.</b> Accurate <b>timing,</b> estimated to be within 0.05 s, is provided by a precise crystal oscillator. All the OBSs are of a pop-up type with an acoustic release system. The OBS position at the sea floor was estimated by using acoustic ranging and ship GPS positions.

The analysis is motivated by the possibility that a naive implementation of RC 5 could result in the data-dependent rotations taking a time that {{is a function of the}} data. Such implementations are possible, for example, in a digital hardware or 8 -bit microcontroller environment. Based on the assumption that accurate timing measurements are available for individual encryptions, the methodology of deriving key <b>bits</b> using <b>timing</b> information from a set of ciphertexts is outlined and it is shown that, for the nominal version of RC 5, with only about 2000 ciphertexts and their associated timings, the cryptanalysis can be applied to determine 5 bits of the last half-round subkey with high probability.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} efficient synchronization and detection algorithms for two-dimensional {{magnetic recording}} (TDMR) under a low latency constraint. TDMR {{is a new}} technology for increasing data density of hard disk drives up to 10 Tera bits per square inch of the medium. TDMR read channel suffers from two-dimensional interference, <b>bit</b> position (<b>timing)</b> uncertainty, and data dependent noise, to name a few. The problem of timing uncertainty is addressed with synchronization. This thesis focuses on the synchronization component of the read channel and develops synchronization solutions which effectively compensate for the asynchrony between the phase of the received readback waveforms and the phase of the sampling clocks. In particular, this thesis proposes solutions to reduce the computational cost of current generation of read channels, where only one data track is detected at a time. For future generations of TDMR read channels, where multiple tracks will be detected jointly, this thesis provides a first-time solution to the synchronization problem for joint detection of multiple asynchronous tracks.

Virtual I/O is particularly helpful in generating bit patternâ€™s on a CAN bus which are accurate to a single CAN bit time, as these patterns are generated using the same system clock rather than an external clock as is the case of a bench pattern generator. Based around simple off-the-shelf development boards, general purpose software code and the simple analysis tool Chipscope, the proposed method allows developers to verify the <b>bit</b> <b>timing</b> properties of a CAN soft core against the relevant ISO standards.

Based {{on the fact that}} the integrity of different bits in the trellis state metric has (largely) different effect on the overall trellis decoding performance, we proposed an importance-aware clock skew scheduling technique that assigns those more important <b>bits</b> with longer <b>timing</b> slacks and hence better immunity to VOS-induced errors. This will provide system-level tolerance to VOS-induced errors in trellis decoders.

Most of the OBSs have three-component velocity sensitive electro-magnetic geophones with a natural frequency of 4.5 Hz, and employ a glass sphere as a pressure vessel.

The longest recording period is 1 year {{for this type of}} OBS (Kanazawa et al., 2009). Broadband-type OBSs (BBOBSs), which have broadband seismometers with a large dynamic range, were also deployed. An observational band for the BBOBS is 360 sâ€“ 100 Hz and the BBOBS have a precise absolute pressure gauge for the detection of long-period events and vertical crustal movement.

This paper reports the results of a study analyzing these effects on <b>bit</b> <b>timing</b> subsystems. Consideration is given to both the filter-rectifier and transition tracking type of timing subsystem. Although both these systems perform similarly in high SNR and ideal pulse models, pulse distortion and intersymbol affects each differently. The primary effects in both systems is to cause the presence of an irreducible mean squared timing error due to the intersymbol which limits the ultimate performance. Design procedures to minimize the anomalies of both systems are presented, and indicate modifications of the standard timing subsystems. It is found that specific design directions depend on whether the intersymbol or the receiver noise tends to dominate...|$|E

WDM can potentially provide hundreds of Gb/s channels in the same fiber. However, because of channel interference in WDM, performance analysis is important to design the system properly. In this thesis, a detailed noise and jitter analysis has been performed for an optical heterodyne PSK receiver used in WDM. In WDM, noise sources include shot noise, channel interference noise, and phase noise. These noise sources will not only add to the signal, but also cause timing jitter at the <b>bit</b> <b>timing</b> recovery.

There alreadyÂ  exist many articles and papers devoted {{to the theory of}} these codes. This thesis, however, focuses on practical implementation issues of turbo codes, with synchronization problems as the main topic. Turbo codes are usually discussed under assumptions of perfect channel estimation and synchronization. It simplifies the analysis but does not show their true performance in realistic conditions. This thesis investigates, among others, the effects of non-perfect timing and phase offset recovery on bit error rate. It is shown that non-perfect synchronization can severely impair turbo coding gains. The typical ML synchronization algorithms may not be a good solution for turbo code systems, mostly due to the low signal-to-noise region in which such codes operate. This work postulates using the soft bit output of the BCJR algorithm as the source of better statistics for synchronization algorithms. Two algorithms using soft <b>bits</b> for <b>timing</b> recovery are presented and shown to outperform the classical ML NDA method. The phase offset compensation can also be significantly improvedÂ  when using soft bits. The salient advantage of using the BCJR algorithm for synchronization purposes lies, however, in its ability to detect non-linear phenomena of cycle-slip and M-fold phase ambiguity. This eliminates the necessity of transmitting additional pilot symbols, which increases the available bandwidth...|$|R
