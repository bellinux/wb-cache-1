50|$|Cable (who was {{presumed dead}} after the Second Coming event) returns from a desolate future {{after having been}} {{informed}} by Blaquesmith that the Avengers are somehow {{responsible for the death}} of Hope Summers and the terrible future. To prevent Hope's death, he devises a plan to take down the Avengers one by one before they can harm her. Cable first attracts the attention of the Avengers by shooting down a prison transport plane. As the Avengers round up the escaping prisoners, Cable kidnaps the Falcon. Captain America follows Redwing (the Falcon's trained pet falcon) to where Cable is holding the Falcon, only to be ambushed by Cable and put in restraints. Next, Cable defeats Iron Man using technology taken from a future suit of Iron Man's armor. Red Hulk arrives and surprises Cable, but is narrowly defeated when Cable infects him with the techno-organic virus. Believing that Cable has gone too far, Blaquesmith sends in Cyclops and Hope to stop him. Cyclops and Hope plead with Cable to release the Avengers, but are interrupted by the arrival of Spider-Man and Wolverine. While Cable is distracted fighting Spider-Man and Wolverine, Hope (guided by Blaquesmith) frees the captured Avengers, while the Red Hulk burns the techno-organic virus out of his <b>body.</b> <b>Cable</b> succumbs to the combined efforts of the Avengers and his own infection of the techno-organic virus, and is brought to Utopia. Blaquesmith tells Hope that she can still save Cable by absorbing the techno-organic virus with the Phoenix Force. Once fully healed, Cable informs Cyclops that Hope is indeed the Phoenix, and that he needs his help to protect her when war comes with the Avengers.|$|E

40|$|A {{framework}} {{for the development of}} robust time integration schemes for nonlinear, flexible multibody systems is presented. The proposed schemes are designed to meet four specific requirements: nonlinear unconditional stability of the scheme, a rigorous treatment of both geometric and material nonlinearities, exact satisfaction of the constraints, and the presence of high frequency numerical dissipation. Specific algorithms are presented for rigid <b>bodies,</b> <b>cables,</b> beams, shells, and elasto-dynamics. The kinematic nonlinearities are treated in a rigorous manner for all elements, and the material nonlinearities can be handled when the constitutive laws stem from the existence of a strain energy density function. The treatment of the constraint equations associated with the six lower pair joints are presented as well. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with specific numerical examples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Nevertheless, in terms of the compressive stress in coal body formed by the bolt and cable’s prestress, under the impact of the increase of cable’s prestress and the superposition effect of the bolt’s prestress, the maximum compressive stress close to the cable in the coal body reaches 0.88  MPa. When the bolt’s tightening torque is 200, and 300  N m, the distribution of compressive stress formed in the coal <b>body</b> by <b>cables</b> and bolts is not uniform, the compressible stress between two bolts farther away from cables is 0.48  MPa.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of combining the flexibility and light - weight of polymers {{with the highest}} insulation of ceramics, drives the field of nanocomposites for potential commercial application. The inclusion of nano-sized insulating particles in the polymer matrix, and orienting the fillers along the direction of heat flow results in modifying the induced interfaces for effective phonon propagation. Such flexible polymer nanocomposites (PNC) offer easy workability and refined insulating effect with high thermal conductivity and fire-retardancy. Hence, opening a wider arena of applications with the advantage of their light-weight. The engineering of the interfaces, is the key for dictating the desired properties at the macro-scale. Consequently, silane functionalisation of nanoparticles with designed dispersion technique was tried for achieving this purpose. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) were done to characterize the properties {{and structure of the}} synthesised nanocomposite. This paper reports that surface modification of the nanoparticles can effectively solve the dispersion problem and reduces the electric field charge concentration at the interface. Synthesising PNC with selective nanoparticle loading percentage can yield a lmost 6 - 12 % increase in the thermal capacity and fire retardability of the base polymer.

40|$|Sleep is {{important}} for the development of preterm infants. During sleep, neural connections are formed and the development of brain regions is triggered. In general, various rudimentary sleep states can be identified in the preterm infant, namely active sleep (AS), quiet sleep (QS) and intermediate sleep (IS). As the infant develops, sleep states change in length and organization, with these changes as important indicators of brain development. As a result, several methods have been deployed to distinguish between the different preterm infant sleep states, among which polysomnography (PSG) is the most frequently used. However, this method is limited by the use of adhesive electrodes or patches that are attached to the <b>body</b> by numerous <b>cables</b> that can disturb sleep. Given the importance of sleep, this review explores more unobtrusive methods that can identify sleep states without disturbing the infant.

40|$|Abstract—Gait {{and balance}} {{training}} {{is an essential}} ingredi-ent for locomotor rehabilitation of patients with neurological impairments. Robotic overhead support systems may help these patients train, for example by relieving them of part of their body weight. However, there are only very few systems that provide support during overground gait, and these suffer from limited degrees of freedom and/or undesired interaction forces due to uncompensated robot dynamics, namely inertia. Here, we suggest a novel mechanical concept {{that is based on}} cable robot technology and that allows three-dimensional gait training while reducing apparent robot dynamics to a minimum. The solution does not suffer from the conventional drawback of cable robots, which is a limited workspace. Instead, displaceable deflection units follow the human subject above a large walking area. These deflection units are not actuated, instead they are implicitly displaced by means of the forces in the cables they deflect. This leads to an underactuated design, because the deflection units cannot be moved arbitrarily. However, the design still allows accurate control of a three-dimensional force vector acting on a human subject during gait. We describe the mechanical concept, the control concept, and we show first experimental results obtained with the device, including the force control performance during robot-supported overground gait of five human subjects without motor impairments.
