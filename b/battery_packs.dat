5|$|A 2016 {{study by}} Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) found that {{availability}} of lithium and other finite {{materials used in}} the <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> {{will not be a}} limiting factor for the adoption of electric vehicles. BNEF estimated that <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> will require less than 1% of the known reserves of lithium, nickel, manganese, and copper through 2030, and 4% of the world’s cobalt. After 2030, the study states that new battery chemistries will probably shift to other source materials, making packs lighter, smaller, and cheaper.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Power <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> under high-rate {{discharge}} conditions produces thermal aggregation phenomena. Generated heat during charging and discharging that distributes in <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> affects performance of battery {{and so that}} shortens its life. So the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> thermal management is necessary to electric vehicles. In this paper, an ideal thermal management solution is put forward with a <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> temperature equilibrium approach and a <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> overall thermal dissipation structure by finite element analysis. Theoretical analysis result shows that the thermal management solution can effectively cool the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> to the ideal working temperature range 25 ~ 40 oC and improve the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> temperature uniformity with the maximum temperature difference which is below 5 oC, which enhance the cycle life of power <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> for electric vehicle applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Based on the HPPC {{test data}} of 8 Ah/ 144 V {{lithium-ion}} <b>battery</b> <b>pack,</b> the PNGV model parameters are identified when operation temperature of <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> is 20 ℃ {{and the model}} of PNGV of high-power lithium ion <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> is build. According to actual operation characteristics of high-power <b>battery</b> <b>pack,</b> the actual output voltage and model predictive voltage are compared under the high-power <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> different operating condition based on Arbin test bench. It’s showed that the PNGV model predictive precision is not high when high-power <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> is under steady state condition; the model predictive precision is high when high-power <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> is under dynamic condition; the difference between model predictive voltage and actual output voltage will be bigger as the operation temperature increased...|$|R
5|$|A plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEV) is any motor vehicle {{that can be}} recharged from an external source of electricity, such as wall sockets, and the electricity stored in the rechargeable <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> drives or contributes to drive the wheels. PEV is a subset of {{electric vehicle}}s that includes all-electric or battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. In China, plug-in electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).|$|E
5|$|Pile and her co-writers {{initially}} used <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> {{to represent}} characters, moving them around {{on her desk}} to develop scenarios for the show. The decision to make the characters doctors came later. Pile recalls that she mentioned to Peter Fincham that a hospital setting would work well and that he subsequently reported that Channel 4 were enthusiastic about a hospital location, which settled the matter. Even later still, a plot was developed and wall charts were used to mark up story arcs.|$|E
5|$|The Volt's {{battery is}} {{guaranteed}} by General Motors {{for eight years}} or , and will cover all 161 battery components. GM estimates that the Volt batteries will degrade by 10 to 30% after 8 years or 100,000 miles. GM has applied for a patent that may allow technicians to quickly and cheaply recover some {{of the performance of}} degraded <b>battery</b> <b>packs.</b> The Volt’s battery management system runs more than 500 diagnostics at 10 times per second, allowing it {{to keep track of the}} Volt’s battery pack in real-time, 85% of which ensure the battery pack is operating safely and 15% monitor battery performance and life.|$|E
50|$|A common {{complaint}} {{found in}} most HX-20 computers today is {{the failure of the}} internal Ni-Cd rechargeable <b>battery</b> <b>pack.</b> The <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> is easily replaced by a NiMH (or equivalent) <b>battery</b> <b>pack.</b> Changing the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> is not generally considered to reduce the collectible value of the computer, as doing so does not damage any internals.|$|R
50|$|The <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> for the Logitech Cordless Precision {{controller}} is Nickel-metal hydride <b>battery.</b> The <b>pack</b> provides up to 300 {{hours on}} 2 AA batteries (not included).

5|$|USB Battery Charging {{defines a}} new port type, the {{charging}} port, {{as opposed to}} the standard downstream port (SDP) of the base specification. Charging ports are divided into 2 further types: the charging downstream port (CDP), which has data signals, and the dedicated charging port (DCP), which does not. Dedicated charging ports can be found on USB power adapters that convert utility power or another power source (e.g., a car's electrical system) to run attached devices and <b>battery</b> <b>packs.</b> On a host (such as a laptop computer) with both standard and charging USB ports, the charging ports should be labeled as such.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} approach to resolve the problems of range anxiety and lack of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles was developed by Better Place. Its business model considers that electric cars are built and sold separately from the battery pack. As customers {{are not allowed to}} purchase <b>battery</b> <b>packs,</b> they must lease them from Better Place which will deploy a network of battery swapping stations thus expanding EVs range and allowing long distance trips. Subscribed users pay a per-distance fee to cover battery pack leasing, charging and swap infrastructure, the cost of sustainable electricity, and other costs. Better Place signed agreement for deployment in Australia, Denmark, Israel, Canada, California, and Hawaii. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the electric car built with switchable battery technology sold for the Better Place network. The robotic battery-switching operation was completed in about five minutes.|$|E
5|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} {{may suffer}} thermal runaway and cell rupture if overheated or overcharged, and {{in extreme cases}} {{this can lead to}} combustion. To reduce these risks, lithium-ion <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> contain fail-safe circuitry that shuts down the battery when its voltage is outside the safe range. When handled improperly, or if manufactured defectively, some rechargeable batteries can experience thermal runaway resulting in overheating. Especially prone to thermal runaway are lithium-ion batteries. Reports of exploding cellphones have been reported in newspapers. In 2006, batteries from Apple, HP, Toshiba, Lenovo, Dell and other notebook manufacturers were recalled because of fire and explosions. Also, during the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's first year of service, at least four aircraft suffered from electrical system problems stemming from its lithium-ion batteries, resulting in the whole Dreamliner fleet being voluntarily grounded in January 2013.|$|E
40|$|Power {{sources of}} {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) are integrated {{by hundreds of}} cells connected in series and parallel. Due to slight differences in the manufacturing process and various operating conditions of the individual cell in a <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> in EVs, {{the characteristics of the}} individual cell to cell can be non-uniform in the <b>battery</b> <b>pack,</b> which affects the available capacity and the life of the <b>battery</b> <b>pack.</b> This paper investigates the neural network (NN) based method to sort lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO 4) cells so that the cells can be as consistant as possible before these cells form a <b>battery</b> <b>pack.</b> All cells used in the sorting process are LiFePO 4 Cells. A clustering NN tool of self-organizing map (SOM) is adopted to classify the cells based on the experimental data of all cells. The cell temperature and capacity are used in the trained SOM to classify the cells. The cells in the same category are connected in series to form a sorted <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> whereas the randomly chosen cells are connected in series to form the unsorted <b>battery</b> <b>pack.</b> The comparison between the sorted <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> and the unsorted <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> has been conducted to verify the clustering methods and the consistency of the cells in the <b>battery</b> <b>pack...</b>|$|R
30|$|The result {{experiments}} reported above {{demonstrate that}} the low-temperature charge-discharge performance of the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> heated in low temperature is improved significantly, and can be draw by the above experiments on the low-temperature heating. The full energy storage capacity can be achieved. However, the maximum charge-discharge power of the heated <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> heated at − 40  °C cannot be achieved because the heated <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> is always charged or discharged at 1 C constant current. Poor voltage performance evident in Figs.  6 and 8 prevents the use higher constant currents. Therefore, some experiments were performed using pulse charge-discharge of the heated <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> at low temperature. Firstly, the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> was charged at 1 C/ 3 at room temperature. Secondly, the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> was placed at − 40  °C for eight hours to reach thermal equilibrium. Thirdly, the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> was heated for 15 min with 90 W power, and finally the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> was subjected to charge and discharge pulse currents. The pulses had the minimum discharge current of 17.5 A and maximum discharge current of 280 A and minimum charge current of 17.5 A and maximum charge current of 210 A. This pulse profile was designed to discharge the <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> as quickly as possible.|$|R

5|$|In March 2013 Mitsubishi Motors {{reported}} {{two separate}} incidents with lithium-ion batteries used in its plug-in electric cars, {{one with an}} i-MiEV {{and the other with}} an Outlander P-HEV whose battery pack overheated and melted some of the battery cells. The <b>battery</b> <b>packs</b> are produced by GS Yuasa, the same company that supplies the batteries for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, whose entire fleet was grounded in January 2013 for lithium-ion battery problems. The lithium-ion battery of an i-MiEV caught fire at the Mizushima battery pack assembly plant on March 18 while connected to charge-discharge test equipment. Mitsubishi did not issue a recall, but halted production and sales of the two models until it determined the causes of the battery problems. According to Mitsubishi, the problem with the i-MiEV battery pack is related to a change in the GS Yuasa manufacturing process, and the carmaker notified fleet-vehicle operators with i-MiEVs whose batteries were made under the same process as those that overheated, and is working on a possible fix.|$|E
