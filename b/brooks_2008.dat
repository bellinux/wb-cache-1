The extinction hypothesis is not actually a hypothesis at all, but rather an inevitable consequence of sustained population decline. Local extinction of Broughton Archipelago pink salmon can be prevented if population declines are turned around, and the data and models suggest this can be achieved if the infestations are stopped.

30|$|The {{increasing}} demand for various industrial purposes such as alternative source of energy, industrial solvents, cleansing agents and preservatives, has necessitated increased production of ethanol (<b>Brooks</b> <b>2008).</b> Furthermore, ethanol by fermentation offers {{a more favorable}} trade balance, enhanced energy security, and a major new crop for a depressed agricultural economy. Ethanol is considerably less toxic to humans than is gasoline (or methanol). Ethanol also reduces smog formation because of low volatility; its photochemical reactivity and low production of combustion products. Furthermore, low levels of smog-producing compounds are formed by its combustion (Wyman and Hinman 1990). In addition, the low flame temperature of ethanol results in good engine performance.|$|E
30|$|Non-native plant invasions are {{responsible}} for {{a broad range of}} ecological effects, including the alteration of fire regimes (Brooks 1999, Davies and Nafus 2012, McDonald and McPherson 2013). In extreme cases, non-native plant invasions may cause community level changes, or even complete transformations of ecosystems by either increasing or decreasing the prevalence of fire (Mack and D’Antonio 1998, Brooks et al. 2004). For example, where non-native grasses invade desert shrubland, they create a novel fuel source that has dramatic consequences for these ecosystems (Brooks 1999, D’Antonio 2000, Davies and Nafus 2012). In cases in which non-native species differ only subtly from native species in the communities that they invade, they may have small effects on biomass, moisture content, or other fuel properties, causing subtle changes to fire regimes (Mack and D’Antonio 1998, D’Antonio 2000, <b>Brooks</b> <b>2008,</b> McGranahan et al. 2013).|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades {{conversation}} analysis (CA) has been used in second language classroom research to understand how instructors and their students achieve teaching and learning (Barraja-Rohan, 2011; Koshik, 1999; Markee, 2004; Wagner, 1996). Recent scholars have taken an approach that combines analysis of both talk and the body (Majlesi, 2014; McCafferty, 2006; Olsher, 2003; Platt and <b>Brooks,</b> <b>2008).</b> Along with the work of the recent scholars, this study looks at how one teacher effectively uses talk, the body, and material artifacts to teach pronunciation in an ESL class in an intensive ESL program. By looking at the teacher’s talk, her embodied movements, and her use of material artifacts, the study sheds light on how the teacher and her students achieve teaching and learning regarding stressed syllables/words and the pronunciation of the phrase ‘It would. ...|$|E
30|$|In many ecosystems, {{non-native}} grass {{species have}} been implicated in altering fire regimes, particularly where they invade areas with no native analogues (Brooks 1999, D’Antonio 2000, Brooks et al. 2004, <b>Brooks</b> <b>2008).</b> In the Bald Hills, potential effects on the fire regime are complex, depending {{to a large extent}} on {{the degree to which the}} composition of the fuelbed has shifted with species invasions. Of the four non-native species that we studied, one of these, Harding grass, sustained high moisture content throughout the growing season and may act to delay ignition and dampen fire spread and intensity. In contrast, the non-native annual dogtail might decrease fuel moisture levels and increase their ignitability earlier in the fire season compared to most native perennial species. Two of the non-native species that we studied, sweet vernal grass and tall oatgrass, did not differ from the native species’ moisture contents.|$|E
3000|$|Students {{struggling}} with academic writing may lack {{the ability to}} use intertextuality as a strategic device and create a woven text (Lee, 2010) and struggle with incorporating other’s ideas and words with their own (Gu & <b>Brooks,</b> <b>2008).</b> Understandings of the use of sources may also be a factor (Hutchings, 2014), which is important considering Hyland's (2000) research findings that the number of references in an academic text has increased and [...] "they have become more focused, pertinent and integrated into the argument" [...] (p. 22). Developing discipline-specific practices for using sources remains essential for students’ integration into the academic community. This is because language is always a socially embedded practice where a particular group of individuals construct language in a particular fashion, thus creating a specific genre (Bakhtin, 1986). Student writers participate in this social group when they incorporate outside sources in ways similar to their disciplines.|$|E

30|$|The {{topic of}} fire regimes was also poorly {{covered in the}} literature—both the fire regime {{characteristics}} that can be tolerated by an invasive species {{and the effects of}} invasives on prevailing fire regimes. The latter knowledge gap is not surprising, since many years of data are needed to document changes in fire regimes. Centuries of data are needed in the case of vegetation types with long fire-return intervals (<b>Brooks</b> <b>2008),</b> and most studies evaluating the effects of invasive species on ecosystem processes only identify initial effects and span only a few years (Mack and D’Antonio 1998). However, because plant assemblages and communities are most likely adapted to disturbance regimes rather than to individual disturbances (Pickett et al. 1987), the understanding of invasive species’ interactions with fire regimes may be critical for long-term protection of biodiversity and continuation of ecosystem-sustaining processes. More experimental studies are needed to investigate the effects of variation in fire season, fire severity, and fire-return intervals on native plant communities and invasive species.|$|E
40|$|Channel {{management}} is one CRM systems component much {{influenced by the}} behaviour of customers in relation to its implementation and use. The consumers ’ behaviours, preferences, perceptions and expectations are crucial for the implementation and use of channel management. Customers ’ contact with the organization’s multi-channels can occur at several touch points throughout the customer lifecycle. Customers ’ behaviours may be differentiated according to the individual or micro level, but it might also differ at an ecological or macro level of analysis (Ramaseshan et al., 2006). In this paper the authors have conducted {{a case study in}} the UK to analyze customers ’ behaviours at a macro level and customers channel choices, through out the customer lifecycle.
