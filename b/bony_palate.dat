5|$|Pennatomys nivalis was a {{medium-sized}} species without many distinctive adaptations. The nasal bones were short and blunt-ended. The zygomatic plate, a bony plate {{at the side}} of the skull, was broad. The <b>bony</b> <b>palate</b> was long and flat. The root of the lower incisor was housed in a bony protuberance, the capsular process. The molars were low-crowned and possess accessory crests such as mesolophs. The upper molars all had three roots.|$|E
5|$|Deinosuchus had a {{secondary}} <b>bony</b> <b>palate,</b> {{which would have}} permitted it to breathe through its nostrils {{while the rest of}} the head remained submerged underwater. The vertebrae were articulated in a procoelous manner, meaning they had a concave hollow on the front end and a convex bulge on the rear; these would have fit together to produce a ball and socket joint. The secondary palate and procoelous vertebrae are advanced features also found in modern eusuchian crocodilians.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have {{relatively}} large maxillary canine teeth, their inner (mesial) maxillary incisors {{are larger than}} the outer (distal) maxillary incisors, {{and they have a}} diastema (gap) between the canine and the first premolar. The first mandibular premolar is elongated, and the last molar has three cusps on the crown, the shortest of which is near the back. The <b>bony</b> <b>palate</b> (roof of the mouth) only goes {{as far back as the}} second molar.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{primitive}} crocodylomorphs, crocodyliforms have secondary <b>bony</b> <b>palates.</b> This feature enables living crocodylians {{to safely}} breathe in through their nostrils {{while the rest}} of the head (including the mouth) remains submerged. This structure reaches its greatest elaboration among eusuchians, in which the internal nares are completely surrounded by the pterygoid bones.|$|R
60|$|How {{the noise}} is made is a question. Cuvier was of opinion that it {{was made by the}} air-bladder, though he could not explain how: but the truth, if truth it be, seems {{stranger}} still. These fish, it seems, have strong <b>bony</b> <b>palates</b> and throat-teeth for crushing shells and crabs, and make this wonderful noise simply by grinding their teeth together.|$|R
5|$|The skull was {{generally}} {{similar to that}} of Oryzomys couesi, as were the teeth. It was robust and bore well-developed supraorbital ridges (located above the eyes) on the braincase. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, was small and narrow. The <b>bony</b> <b>palate</b> extended beyond the third molars. The nasal bones extended further back than the premaxillaries, whereas these bones are usually about coterminous in O.couesi. On average, the incisive foramina, which perforate the front part of the palate, were shorter than in O.couesi. The zygomatic arch (cheekbone) appears to have been better developed in O.antillarum.|$|E
5|$|Species of Voalavo are small, gray, mouse-like rodents, {{among the}} {{smallest}} nesomyines. They lack the distinctive tuft of long {{hairs on the}} tail that is characteristic of Eliurus. The tail is long and females have six mammae. In Voalavo, there are two glands on the chest (absent in Eliurus) that produce a sweet-smelling musk in breeding males. In the skull, the facial skeleton is long and the braincase is smooth. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are long and the <b>bony</b> <b>palate</b> itself is smooth. The molars are somewhat hypsodont (high-crowned), though less so than in Eliurus, and the third molars are reduced in size and complexity.|$|E
5|$|Microgale macpheei {{is known}} from two specimens: a damaged cranium (skull without mandibles, or lower jaws) lacking the back part (the parietal bones and further back) {{as well as}} the incisors, canines, and second premolars; and another damaged cranium lacking the same parts {{as well as the}} left toothrow. Both show no {{evidence}} of ongoing tooth replacement, indicating that the permanent dentition is complete. M.macpheei was larger in most measurements than M.brevicaudata, but because of small samples, some differences are not statistically significant. The length of the <b>bony</b> <b>palate</b> in the two specimens of M.macpheei is 9.4 and 9.7mm, compared to 7.1 to 9.0mm in eight adult M.brevicaudata. In both specimens, the length of the molar row is 3.0mm, compared to 2.4 to 2.8mm in the sample of M.brevicaudata.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out on 208 Nigerian <b>bony</b> <b>palates</b> in dried skulls and on 30 palates {{obtained}} from Nigerian cadavers. Out of 208 dried skulls examined, there was a unilateral spine in 21. 1 % of cases, a bilateral spine in 36. 5 % and a bony canal in 5. 7 %. Of the dissected palates 30 % revealed {{the presence of an}} osseofibrous canal...|$|R
25|$|Most {{reptiles}} lack {{a secondary}} palate, {{meaning that they}} must hold their breath while swallowing. Crocodilians have evolved a <b>bony</b> secondary <b>palate</b> {{that allows them to}} continue breathing while remaining submerged (and protect their brains against damage by struggling prey). Skinks (family Scincidae) also have evolved a <b>bony</b> secondary <b>palate,</b> to varying degrees. Snakes took a different approach and extended their trachea instead. Their tracheal extension sticks out like a fleshy straw, and allows these animals to swallow large prey without suffering from asphyxiation.|$|R
40|$|The {{mouth or}} oral cavity is bounded by muscles and bones:Anteriorly – by the lipsPosteriorly - it is {{continuous}} with the oropharynxLaterally - by {{the muscles of}} the cheeksSuperiorly - by the <b>bony</b> hard <b>palate</b> and muscular soft palateInferiorly - by the muscular tongue and the soft tissues of the floor of the mouth...|$|R
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are long, sometimes extending to between the first molars (M1). The <b>bony</b> <b>palate</b> is broad and short, with the posterior margin between the third molars (M3). Nephelomys levipes is the only other oryzomyine with such a short palate, although that of Eremoryzomys polius is only slightly longer. The posterolateral palatal pits (openings in the back part of the palate near the M3) vary from small to fairly large and are located in slight fossas (depressions). In Eremoryzomys, these fossas are deeper. The roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind the palate, is completely closed or contains small sphenopalatine vacuities. The vacuities are much larger in Eremoryzomys. The alisphenoid strut, a piece of bone that separates two foramina (openings), is present in all Drymoreomys specimens examined, except in one juvenile specimen.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are medium in length, and do not reach the first molars. Their back margin is angular, not rounded as in eastern voalavo. The diastema (the gap between the upper incisors and molars) is shorter than in eastern voalavo. The <b>bony</b> <b>palate</b> is broad and lacks notable ridges and other features, except {{for a pair of}} foramina (openings) near the place where the first and second molars (M1 and M2) meet. The back border of the palate is {{at the level of the}} middle of the third molars (M3). In the bony roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind the palate, wide sphenopalatine vacuities (openings) are present. A thin alisphenoid strut (a piece of bone on the lower side of the skull separating two foramina) is present in specimens from Marojejy, but not in those from Anjanaharibe-Sud. The tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, is reduced.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are short and do not reach between the first molars; they are longer in H.alfaroi. The <b>bony</b> <b>palate</b> is long and extends beyond {{the end of the}} molar row and the back margin of the maxillary bones. The posterolateral palatal pits, which perforate the palate near the third molars, are small, and {{may or may not be}} recessed into a fossa. The sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, behind the palate) are also small, as are the auditory bullae. As in most oryzomyines, the subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull, is present. The pattern of grooves and foramina (openings) in the skull indicates that the circulation of the arteries of the head in T.talamancae follows the primitive pattern, as in most similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys.|$|E
50|$|Thrinaxodontidae is an extinct {{family of}} cynodonts that {{includes}} the genera Thrinaxodon, Nanictosaurus, Nanocynodon, and Novocynodon, and possibly Bolotridon and Platycraniellus. All thrinaxodontids share a <b>bony</b> secondary <b>palate.</b> Thrinaxodontids are basal members of the cynodont clade Epicynodontia. Some studies consider the family a paraphyletic group, representing an evolutionary grade of basal epicynodonts rather than an actual clade.|$|R
5000|$|Based {{on these}} remains, {{the animal is}} {{estimated}} to have been approximately 4 m in length. Its skull measures 33 cm in length and is 25 cm wide. The <b>bony</b> secondary <b>palate</b> is poorly developed in Silvisaurus, the dentary includes at least twenty-five teeth, the basal tubera of the basioccipital are bulbous, and each premaxilla holds eight to nine teeth.|$|R
5000|$|The palate [...] is {{the roof}} of the mouth in humans and other mammals. It {{separates}} the oral cavity from the nasal cavity. A similar structure is found in crocodilians, but, in most other tetrapods, the oral and nasal cavities are not truly separate. The palate is divided into two parts, the anterior <b>bony</b> hard <b>palate,</b> and the posterior fleshy soft palate (or velum).|$|R
5|$|The skull looks delicate. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is {{narrow and}} hourglass-shaped, and the braincase is smooth; both lack conspicuously {{developed}} ridges and shelves. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are poorly developed. The incisive foramina (openings {{in the front}} part of the palate) are short and narrow. The <b>bony</b> <b>palate</b> ends {{at the level of}} the back of the third upper molars. The alisphenoid strut (a piece of bone at the back of the skull separating two foramina, or openings) is absent. The strut is present in most Eliurus, but absent in some specimens of E.grandidieri. The subsquamosal fenestrae (openings in the squamosal bone) are fairly large. The auditory bullae are small. The incisors are weak and the enamel on the upper incisors is yellow to light orange. The root of the lower incisor does not project into a distinct capsular process at the back of the mandible (lower jaw), a feature shared only with E.grandidieri among species of Eliurus.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is short, the interorbital region (between the eyes) {{is broad}} and hourglass-shaped, and the braincase is small. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front {{part of the}} zygomatic arch, is narrow, with poorly developed zygomatic notches at their front, but there is considerable variation in {{the features of the}} plate. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) extend back to between the first molars. The mesopterygoid fossa, the openings behind the <b>bony</b> <b>palate,</b> is very narrow. In the mandible (lower jaw), the masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, extend to near the front margin of the first molar. The capsular process, a raising in the back part of the mandibular bone that accommodates the root of the incisor, is poorly developed. The upper incisors are orthodont (with the chewing edge in the horizontal plane) to slightly opisthodont (with the chewing edge inclined backwards). The molars show some accessory crests and other features, such as the anteroloph on the first upper molar and the mesoloph on the first and second upper molar.|$|E
5|$|The maxilla of Paranthodon {{preserves}} the tooth row, and {{shows that there}} is little to no overhang. This differs from ankylosaurians, where there is a large amount of overhang of the maxilla. The teeth also have a middle ridge, with five fewer prominent ridges on either side. This is similar to the size ridges seen on Kentrosaurus. Like all stegosaurians, the denticles on the teeth are rounded at the tips, in contrast to ankylosaurians. Also, like Huayangosaurus, but unlike Kentrosaurus and Stegosaurus, Paranthodon possesses a prominent buccal margination (a ridge beside the tooth row). Paranthodon teeth preserve wear, but wear is absent on most teeth, similar to Huayangosaurus, meaning it is likely that Paranthodon lacked occlusion between teeth. Paranthodon is distinguished from other stegosaurs by a long, wide, posterior process of the premaxilla, teeth in the maxilla with a very large cingulum, and large ridges on the tooth crowns. Not all of these features were considered valid in a 2008 review of Stegosauria, with the only autapomorphy found being the possession of a partial second <b>bony</b> <b>palate</b> on the maxilla.|$|E
25|$|Although mammary glands are a {{signature}} feature of modern mammals, {{little is known}} about the evolution of lactation as these soft tissues are not often preserved in the fossil record. Most research concerning the evolution of mammals centers on the shapes of the teeth, the hardest parts of the tetrapod body. Other important research characteristics include the evolution of the middle ear bones, erect limb posture, a <b>bony</b> secondary <b>palate,</b> fur, hair, and warm-bloodedness.|$|R
25|$|The gorgonopsians {{still had}} some {{primitive}} features: no <b>bony</b> secondary <b>palate</b> (but other {{bones in the}} right places to perform the same functions); sprawling forelimbs; hindlimbs that could operate in both sprawling and erect postures. But the therocephalians ("beast heads"), which appear to have arisen {{at about the same time}} as the gorgonopsians, had additional mammal-like features, e.g. their finger and toe bones had the same number of phalanges (segments) as in early mammals (and the same number that primates have, including humans).|$|R
50|$|The {{teeth of}} {{the upper and lower}} jaw contain bump rows that fit {{together}} perfectly in order to maintain an accurate bite. Oligokyphus had a face similar to that of modern mammals, although there were differences in the cheekbones and eye sockets. It had a <b>bony</b> secondary <b>palate</b> and double-rooted cheek teeth. Unlike mammals, the teeth of Oligokyphus did not occlude. The jaw was double jointed, and the neck was flexible, with an atlas and axis and a double occipital condyle.|$|R
5|$|The skull {{is small}} and delicate. The front part, the rostrum, is narrow and {{relatively}} long. The nasal bones are rounded at the front, but blunt at the back. The zygomatic plate—a bony plate {{at the side of}} the skull—is narrow and extends back to the front margin of the first upper molar (M1). The jugal bones constitute much of the thin zygomatic arches (cheekbones). The interorbital region, between the eyes, is narrow and hourglass-shaped. There are no crests or ridges on the interorbital region or on the braincase. The incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend back to a point between the front roots of the M1s. The <b>bony</b> <b>palate</b> itself is broad and lacks many indentations and protuberances present in other species. Its posterior margin is at the level of the upper third molars (M3s). There is no alisphenoid strut, so that the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium, two openings on the underside of the skull, are fused. There are 13 thoracic (chest), 7 lumbar (abdomen), 4 sacral (hip), and 38 caudal (tail) vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Voalavo also {{resembles that of}} Eliurus, with a long facial skeleton, an hourglass-shaped interorbital region (between the eyes), and a smooth interorbital region and braincase, without ridges or shelves. Other shared {{characteristics}} include an essentially featureless <b>bony</b> <b>palate,</b> without many pits and ridges, and a broad mesopterygoid fossa (the opening behind the palate). In other characteristics, Voalavo resembles some but not all species of Eliurus. For example, {{the length of the}} incisive foramina matches the maximum seen in Eliurus species (in this case, in Major's tufted-tailed rat and White-tipped tufted-tailed rat). The back margin of the incisive foramen is rounded in eastern voalavo, but angular in northern voalavo. The two species also differ {{in the shape of the}} suture (dividing line) between the maxillary and palatine bones, which is straight in eastern voalavo, but more curved in northern voalavo. The capsular process, a projection at the back of the mandible (lower jaw) that houses the root of the lower incisor, is indistinct in Voalavo, a feature it shares with Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, Major's tufted-tailed rat, and Petter's tufted-tailed rat, but not the other species of Eliurus.|$|E
5|$|Protosuchians were small, mostly {{terrestrial}} animals with short snouts and long limbs. They had bony armor {{in the form}} of two rows of plates extending from head to tail, and this armor is retained by most modern crocodilians. Their vertebrae were convex on the two main articulating surfaces, and their bony palates were little developed. The mesosuchians saw a fusion of the palatine bones to form a secondary <b>bony</b> <b>palate</b> and a great extension of the nasal passages to near the pterygoid bones. This allowed the animal to breathe through its nostrils while its mouth was open under the water. The eusuchians continued this process with the interior nostrils now opening through an aperture in the pterygoid bones. The vertebrae of eusuchians had one convex and one concave articulating surface, allowing for a ball and socket type joint between the vertebrae, bringing greater flexibility and strength. The oldest known eusuchian is Hylaeochampsa vectiana from the lower Cretaceous of the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. It was followed by crocodilians such as the Pristichampsidae, the so-called 'hoofed crocodiles', in the Palaeogene. Spanning the Cretaceous and Palaeogene periods is the genus Borealosuchus of North America, with six species, though its phylogenetic position is not settled.|$|E
50|$|The {{skull of}} Trirachodon had a short, narrow snout {{with a wide}} orbital region. The {{zygomatic}} arches were relatively slender. Trirachodon was quite small for a cynodont, growing no larger than 50 cm in length. It had noticeably less molariform teeth than its closely related contemporary Diademodon. These teeth tended to be transversely broader than Diademodon as well. A <b>bony</b> secondary <b>palate</b> and precise postcanine tooth occlusion are seen as derived characteristics in Trirachodon {{that are similar to}} those of mammals.|$|R
50|$|At the {{underside}} of the skull, the paired front praemaxillae form a <b>bony</b> secondary <b>palate,</b> with a concave surface. Each praemaxilla is pierced by two foramina. Both elements are at the snout tip separated by a gap, ending about thirty-five millimetres in front of the tip of the narrow and flat vomers at the midline. Behind the praemaxillae, the internal wings of the maxillae form the edges of the choanae, the internal nostrils. To the rear of the vomers, triangular palatine bones are located. These are not pierced by large fenestrae though a triangular depression is present at their undersides.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{their great}} {{similarities}} in appearance and lifestyle, {{there are still}} a number of minor differences that distinguish phytosaurs from true crocodiles. For one thing, the phytosaur ankle structure is much more primitive than that of any crocodile. Also, phytosaurs lack the <b>bony</b> secondary <b>palate</b> that enables crocodiles to breathe even when the mouth has much water. However, it is possible that phytosaurs had a fleshy palate, as many Mesozoic crocodiles are presumed to have had. Phytosaurs were even better armoured than crocodiles, protected by heavy bony scutes (often found as fossils), and the belly reinforced with a dense arrangement of gastralia (abdominal ribs). Finally, and most noticeably, phytosaurs had nostrils placed near or above the level of the eyes, in contrast to crocodiles where the nostrils are {{near the end of the}} snout. This adaptation may have developed to allow them to breathe while the rest of the body was submerged.|$|R
5|$|A {{medium-sized}} oryzomyine, Pennatomys {{is known}} {{from a number}} of skeletal remains, many of which are fragmentary. Both skull and postcranial bones are represented. Although there are no unusual adaptations in the known material, the animal possesses a combination of characteristics that distinguish it from all other known oryzomyines. The skull is known only from fragments. The nasal bones extend back to a point before or slightly behind the point where the maxillary, frontal, and lacrimal bones meet, and have a blunt back margin. The nasals extend slightly further back than the premaxillaries. The lacrimals articulate with both the frontals and the maxillaries, a trait that distinguishes Pennatomys from its closest relatives (which have lacrimals articulating mainly with the frontals). The interorbital region of the skull bears weak crests at its sides. The zygomatic plate, a bony plate {{at the side of the}} skull, is broad and its back margin is located in front of the first upper molar (M1). The incisive foramina, openings in the <b>bony</b> <b>palate,</b> extend back to a point next to the front root of M1. The palate itself is long and flat, extending beyond the third upper molars (M3). In the mandible (lower jaw), there is a capsular process—a protuberance at the back of the jawbone that houses the root of the lower incisor. Below the molars, the upper and lower masseteric ridges (crests which support some of the chewing muscles) are sometimes conjoined towards the front, and they extend forward to a point below the first lower molar (m1). The conjoined crests are one of the synapomorphic (shared-derived) characters of the Nectomys subclade.|$|E
25|$|Mammals have a {{secondary}} <b>bony</b> <b>palate,</b> which separates the respiratory {{passage from the}} mouth, allowing them to eat and breathe at the same time. Secondary bony palates {{have been found in}} the more advanced cynodonts and have been used as evidence of high metabolic rates. But some cold-blooded vertebrates have secondary bony palates (crocodilians and some lizards), while birds, which are warm-blooded, do not.|$|E
25|$|The vangas are {{an example}} of {{adaptive}} radiation, having evolved from a single founding population {{into a variety of}} forms adapted to various niches occupied by other bird families {{in other parts of the}} world. They differ in size, colour and bill shape but are similar in skull shape and <b>bony</b> <b>palate</b> structure. They are small to medium-sized birds, varying from 12 to 32cm in length. Many have strong, hooked bills similar to those of shrikes. The helmet vanga has a particularly large bill with a casque on top. Other species, such as the newtonias, have a small, thin bill. The sickle-billed vanga is notable for its long, curved bill used to probe into holes and cracks.|$|E
40|$|Cleft palate is {{a common}} {{congenital}} birth defect in humans. In mammals, the palatal tissue can be distinguished into anterior <b>bony</b> hard <b>palate</b> and posterior muscular soft palate that have specialized functions in occlusion, speech or swallowing. Regulation of palate development {{appears to be the}} result of distinct signaling and genetic networks in the anterior and posterior regions of the palate. Development and maintenance of expression of these region-specific genes is crucial for normal palate development. Numerous transcription factors and signaling pathways are now recognized as either anterior- (e. g., Msx 1, Bmp 4, Bmp 2, Shh, Spry 2, Fgf 10, Fgf 7, Shox 2) or posterior-specific (e. g., Meox 2, Tbx 22, Barx 1). Localized expression and function clearly highlight the importance of regional patterning and differentiation within the palate at the molecular level. Here, we review how these molecular pathways and networks regulate the anterior-posterior patterning and development of secondary palate. We hypothesize that the anterior palate acts as a signaling center in setting up development of the secondary palate...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT—The {{anatomy of}} the {{external}} naris and anterior palate is described in detail for Lycaenodon longiceps, a morphologically conservative member of the primitive therapsid clade Biarmosuchia. Therapsids are distinguished from pelycosaur-grade synapsids by numerous features of the naris and palate. As in most early therapsids, the septomaxilla in Lycaenodon consists of a short intranarial portion and a long, posterodorsal, facial process. The septomaxillary foramen is reduced to a small, longitudinal slit between the septomaxilla and maxilla. On the palate, the unpaired vomer is clasped anteriorly by long palatal processes of the premaxillae. The choanae are elongate structures whose anterior portion housed the lower canine when the jaws were closed. The palatine and maxilla bear a small shelf (crista choanalis) on their medial surface that has been suggested to represent an early stage {{in the development of}} a secondary palate. The parallel acquisition of a crista choanalis and a <b>bony</b> secondary <b>palate</b> in several therapsid groups supports the hypothesis that respiration-related changes were an important aspect of early therapsid evolution. The genus Lycaenodon may be diagnosed by at least three autapomorphies: the premaxilla bears a scroll-like choanal process that roofs the anterior portion of the internal nares, the vomer is widest at the level of the upper canines with its downturned edges beginning more posteriorly, and the dorsal surface of the postfrontal is convex. Another specimen referred to Lycaenodon preserves additional features that might be autapomorphic, but are not preserved in the holotype...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT—Seemingly {{consistent}} proportional {{differences in}} several palatal structures {{have been noted}} between Permian and Triassic anomodont therapsids for nearly a century. These patterns have been cited as {{evidence in support of}} a decline in atmospheric oxygen concentrations that may have contributed to end-Permian terrestrial extinctions. However, it is not known whether the observed differences are significant, or whether they stem from continued directional selection. If they are not significant, or if their timing does not match that proposed for the oxygen decline, support for the hypoxia-based extinction scenario would be weakened. We tested whether the internal nares and <b>bony</b> secondary <b>palate,</b> two palatal features proposed to be related to respiratory efficiency, are significantly larger in Triassic anomodonts, and whether the variation can be attributed to a long-term tendency for increase. Results based on raw data indicate that Triassic anomodonts have significantly larger secondary palates than Permian anomodonts. They also have significantly larger internal nares, but only when primitive, morphologically-divergent specimens are not considered. Although nares and palate size are correlated with stratigraphic occurrence, available data reject the hypothesis that the observed differences were the result of a long-term trend. Most of {{these findings are consistent with}} the predictions of the hypoxia scenario. However, removing the effects of body size and phylogeny causes some of the differences to break down, indicating that if selection for increased respiratory efficiency affected these characters, it was most likely not the only factor to do so. Therefore, the characters provide only weak evidence in support of the hypoxia scenario, and we recommend against their use for this purpose. Our results emphasiz...|$|R
