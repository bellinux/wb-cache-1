5000|$|Biamplification {{enables a}} bassist {{to use a}} {{crossover}} circuit to split their bass signal into two: a low frequency signal and a high frequency signal, and then route the low and high frequencies into two power amplifiers, each of which send their powered signal to different speaker enclosures. One power amp (usually of higher power) handles the low frequencies, which are sent the larger drivers (at lower frequencies), and a less powerful amp amplifies the high frequencies, which are sent to the horn. For bass players seeking a pure, transparent sound, biamplification may produce a [...] "cleaner" [...] sound. For bass players in hard rock or heavy metal who are using an overdriven sound, biamplification may be safer for the horn or tweeter; while a clipped, distorted signal can be handled by a heavy-duty woofer, the same clipped signal will come much closer to damaging a horn driver or a tweeter. <b>Biamping</b> allows a bassist to have the [...] "dirty" [...] overdriven sound through their woofer(s) while keeping the signal sent to the horn clean, thus protecting the horn. At the high onstage volume levels used in large rock and metal concerts, a powerful, overdriven bass signal poses {{a higher risk of}} horn damage in non-biamped systems.|$|E
5000|$|In 1969, {{the company}} {{acquired}} a majority {{interest in the}} company Nosler Bullets (also a family company), and then sold off their portion in 1988. [...] Other ventures include <b>Biamp</b> Systems 1985-1986 makers of sound equipment and Fabmark 1984-1990 a sheet metal fabrication division that serviced high technology companies.|$|R
50|$|Hellborg {{has been}} {{involved}} in instrument design from early on in his career. His work includes a signature model for Aria, the first ever <b>biamped</b> bass amplifier (in cooperation with Italian company FBT), a double neck bass, fretted and fretless, for British company Wal in 1983 and, in 1984, an acoustic bass in collaboration with master luthier Abraham Wechter.|$|R
50|$|For {{commercial}} sound reinforcement, Bozak {{introduced a}} <b>biamped</b> columnar loudspeaker in 1962. In 1963, {{the newly established}} commercial loudspeaker division was employing about 60 people dedicated to manufacturing the columnar model which was proving a great success. At 18 years of age Bob Betts was hired as Rudy's lab technician, but was soon {{put in charge of}} the Acoustics Lab, in 1965. Betts became chief engineer in 1968 after returning from the Vietnam war. Rudy Bozak and Betts traveled extensively on company business and Bozak often tutored Betts with his college work.|$|R
5000|$|The Portland Jazz Festival, {{now known}} as the <b>Biamp</b> PDX Jazz Festival, is an annual multi-venue series of jazz events that is held in Portland, Oregon during the month of February. [...] The events are usually held in {{downtown}} ballrooms, clubs, hotels and cafés. The event is organized around a new theme each year. [...] The festival is produced by PDX Jazz, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization. [...] The festival has featured such artists as Dee Dee Bridgewater, Randy Weston, David Frishberg, Esperanza Spalding, Ravi Coltrane, Jim Hall, Nicholas Payton, Tom Grant, Wayne Shorter, Regina Carter, Morten Qvenild, Dianne Reeves, and McCoy Tyner.|$|R
50|$|As {{the export}} trade has grown, {{the degree of}} {{domestic}} added value of the products has remained around 80%. The 77th AES convention in Hamburg in 1985 {{was a turning point}} for Genelec. They introduced the 1022A and displayed a whole family of speakers: <b>Biamp</b> 1019A mini monitor, broadcasting monitors S30 and 1022A, and music monitors 1024B and 1025A. By 1985, Genelec produced 12 models. They also made sound reinforcement and passive Hi-Fi speakers for the domestic market. The passive Biway 1050A and Triway 1051A were in production in 1980-1982 and production of the small 1049Abegan in 1988. They have long since discontinued production of passive hi-fi speakers.|$|R
2500|$|It {{may seem}} from the Latency vs. Channels per bundle table that more {{information}} can be sent at a lower latency. [...] However, {{that is not the}} case. [...] More channels can be sent per bundle, but fewer bundles can be processed simultaneously by one device. [...] So, while eight 24-bit, 96kHz channels can be sent in one bundle at [...] ms latency, due to processing constraints, the CobraNet device may only be able to send and receive one bundle instead of the usual four. [...] The bundle capacity of CobraNet devices are unique to the particular device, and are not always the same. [...] The Channels per bundle vs. test case latencies table illustrates the bundle capacity for a <b>Biamp</b> AudiaFLEX-CM DSP device. [...] The Rx and Tx columns indicate the absolute maximum number of channels that can be received or transmitted. [...] The Rx/Tx column represents the maximum number of channels that can be received and transmitted simultaneously.|$|R

The lab features flexible, ergonomic seating, a Christie MicroTiles display wall touch-enabled for up to 20 simultaneous touches and a custom 8-foot gaming bridge console with a 20” AMX Modero X touch panel for room control. The lab is further equipped with a Sennheiser K-array 5.1 surround sound system with <b>BiAmp</b> AudiaFlex audio processing, a custom, liquid-cooled game server with dual NVIDIA GTX 690 graphics cards and with an overclocked Intel i7 quad-core processor with 256GB SSD, 32GB memory and 10Ge Ethernet.
