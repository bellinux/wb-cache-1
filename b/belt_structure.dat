50|$|Sorters can be chute-type or belt-type. Belt-type {{machines}} break {{a smaller}} percentage of material (important for nuts) {{and the product}} stays relatively static during the transport process as it moves horizontally on the belt. Whereas in the chute type, material slides on the chute because of gravity, causing collision, friction, and larger vertical movements, thus worsening the ratio of broken material. The <b>belt</b> <b>structure</b> makes the transmission smooth and stable without bouncing of material. Chute type is more common especially for food, as prices are lower, capacities are higher and products can be seen more easily from both sides, which is important when a dehulled grain has hull only at one side. Chute sorters are usually applicable to specific products as the chute is designed with special channels {{for this kind of}} material based on sizes and shapes of the material, for example 5 mm chutes are used for rice, grain and plastic granules. Flat chutes are right for plastic flakes, such as PET, or milk bottle flakes.|$|E

Over a timescale comparable to the age of the Solar System, Neptune's gravity destabilises the orbits of any objects that happen to lie in certain regions, and either sends them into the inner Solar System or out into the scattered disc or interstellar space.

In the region between 40 and 42 AU, for instance, no objects can retain a stable orbit over such times, and any observed in that region must have migrated there relatively recently.|$|R

40|$|The Kuiper belt is a {{population}} of small bodies located outside Neptune's orbit. The observed Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) {{can be divided into}} several subclasses based on their dynamical structure. I construct models for these subclasses and use numerical integrations to investigate their long-term evolution. I use these models to quantify the connection between the Kuiper belt and the Centaurs (objects whose orbits cross the orbits of the giant planets) and the short-period comets in the inner solar system. I discuss how these connections could be used to determine the physical properties of KBOs and what future observations could conclusively link the comets and Centaurs to specific Kuiper belt subclasses. The Kuiper <b>belt's</b> <b>structure</b> is determined by a combination of long-term evolution and its formation history. The large eccentricities and inclinations of some KBOs and the prevalence of KBOs in mean motion resonances with Neptune are evidence that much of the Kuiper <b>belt's</b> <b>structure</b> originated during the solar system's epoch of giant planet migration; planet migration can sculpt the Kuiper belt's scattered disk, capture objects into mean motion resonances, and dynamically excite KBOs. Different models for planet migration predict different formation locations for the subclasses of the Kuiper belt, which might result in different size distributions and compositions between the subclasses; the high-inclination portion of the classical Kuiper belt is hypothesized to have formed closer to the Sun than the low-inclination classical Kuiper belt. I use my model of the classical Kuiper belt to show that these two populations remain largely dynamically separate over long timescales, so primordial physical differences could be maintained until the present day. The current Kuiper belt is much less massive than the total mass required to form its largest members. It must have undergone a mass depletion event, which is likely related to planet migration. The Haumea collisional family dates from the end of this process. I apply long-term evolution to family formation models and determine how they can be observationally tested.

40|$|Interaction between surface {{processes}} and deep tectonic processes {{plays a key}} role in the structural evolution, kinematics and exhumation of rocks in orogenic wedges. The deformation patterns observed in analogue models applied to natural cases of present active or ancient mountain belts reflect several first order processes that result of these interactions. Internal strain partitioning due to mechanical behaviour of a thrust wedge has a strong impact on the vertical component of displacement of tectonic units that in return favour erosion in domains of important uplift. Such strain partitioning is first controlled by tectonic processes, but surface processes exert a strong feed back on wedge dynamics. Indeed, material transfer in thrust wedges not only depends on its internal dynamics, it is also influenced by climate controlled surface processes involving erosion and sedimentation. Effects of erosion are multiple: they allow long term localization of deformed domains, they favour important exhumation above areas of deep underplating and combined with sedimentation in the foreland they contribute to maintain the wedge in a critical state for long time periods. The simple models illustrate well how mountain <b>belts</b> <b>structure,</b> kinematics of tectonic units and exhumation are determined by these complex interactions...|$|R

Throughout the minimum following cycle 22 the CME and ICME rates roughly tracked each other, while for the minimum following cycle 23 they diverged. During the minimum after solar cycle 23, there were large variations in the streamer <b>belt</b> <b>structure.</b> During the lowest activity period of cycle 23 (based on sunspot numbers), the ICME rate was about four times higher than during a similar activity period of cycle 22.

The maximum magnetic fields of the ICMEs identified during the minimum following cycle 23 were ~ 30 % lower and their radial widths were ~ 15 % lower compared to the ICMEs observed during the minimum following solar cycle 22.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} constitutive {{modeling of}} dynamically loaded elastomeric {{products such as}} power transmission belts. During the normal operation of the belts certain segments of the <b>belt</b> <b>structure</b> are loaded with a tooth-like periodic (cyclic) loading. When the time-dependent properties of the elastomeric material "match" the time-scale of the dynamic loading a strain accumulation process occurs. The critical angular velocity {{is proportional to the}} ratio of the belt length to the common diameters of the pulleys. The magnitude of the strain accumulated in each loading cycle decreases with an increase in belt length. For a given belt geometry the critical angular velocity increases with the number of loading cycles. At the same time the magnitude of the accumulated strain decreases non-linearly as the number of loading cycles increases. However if the belt operates at or in the close vicinity of its critical angular velocity it will almost certainly fail! The critical angular velocity depends on the material retardation time (location in the frequency spectrum), while the magnitude of the accumulated strain is dictated by the strength of the corresponding discrete spectrum lines. Thus, the mechanical spectrum of the elastomeric material from which the belt is constructed is the most important material function for predicting the durability of drive belts and similarly dynamically loaded elastomeric products...|$|E
40|$|Hundreds of kilometres-long, arc-shaped, {{continuous}} thrust faults commonly imply {{very large}} displacements by detachment-dominated thrusting. Therefore, their occurrence {{has a large}} impact on fold–thrust <b>belt</b> <b>structure.</b> One of the major thrust faults of the central-northern Apennines, the Umbria–Marche–Sabina Thrust Zone, is traditionally believed to represent one such feature, characterised by displacements of several tens of kilometres. However, detailed studies of this structure revealed that it is actually composed {{of a series of}} partially overlapping fault segments, rather than consisting of a single, continuous thrust. Cross-section balancing and restoration, carried out by the integration of surface geological data with available sub-surface information, points out relatively limited amounts of thrust displacement (! 10 km). Displacement–distance profiles show moderate displacement gradients well compatible with those reported for coherent thrust sheets. They also suggest that individual thrust segments were originally isolated and then grew by lateral propagation, leading to overlap and variable fault interaction within relay zones. The relationship between maximum displacement and fault trace length tends to follow a powerlaw distribution, as it commonly occurs for fault populations. However, a better correlation could be obtained by further segmentation of the northernmost (blind) fault in an area of no seismic data, thus confirming that fault scaling relationships may be useful for pointing out possible problems with the structural interpretation of poorly constrained areas and for exploring viable alternative solutions...|$|E

Although contemporaneous shortening and uplift was also recognized in the Fuegian Andes central belt (hinterland), previous studies stated that most of that deformation developed out-of-sequence with the thrust-fold belt and hence did not contribute to its shortening. Therefore, no suitable geometric and kinematic model has been proposed for the mechanism that links deformation in both domains. Here we address the style and timing of the younger (Late Cretaceous-Paleogene) structures of the central belt and the structural evolution of the thrust-fold belt, based on published and own data. We reinterpret the style of the central <b>belt</b> <b>structures,</b> proposing a new model in which all the shortening in the foreland cover was caused by basement thrusting in the central belt. We postulate that the basement was involved in a regional-scale duplex whose roof thrust was the décollement of the thin-skinned thrust-fold belt. Therefore, the total slip transferred through the roof thrust accounted for the shortening in the cover rocks. The basement duplex incorporated the underthrust crust from the footwall of the orogenic wedge through forward propagation, in sequence with the thrust-fold belt from the Late Cretaceous to the Miocene.

We have now extended these studies to examine the mechanism by which CAS achieves these changes and to evaluate the potential role for CAS in promoting in vivo tumor growth and metastasis. Whereas {{the presence or absence}} of CAS did not alter the primary growth of subcutaneous-injected Src-transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts, CAS expression was required to promote lung metastasis following removal of the primary tumor. The substrate domain YxxP tyrosines, the major sites of CAS phosphorylation by Src that mediate interactions with Crk, were found to be critical for promoting both invasive and metastatic properties of the cells. The ability of CAS to promote Matrigel invasion, formation of large podosome structures, and tyrosine phosphorylation of Src substrates, including FAK, paxillin, and cortactin, was also strictly dependent on the YxxP tyrosines. In contrast, matrix metalloproteinase- 2 activation was most dependent on the CAS SH 3 domain, whereas the substrate domain YxxP sites also contributed to this property. Thus multiple CAS-mediated signaling events are implicated in promoting invasive and metastatic properties of Src-transformed cells. (Mol Cancer Res 2005; 3 (6) : 307 – 15...|$|R
