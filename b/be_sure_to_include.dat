500|$|The episode satirized the {{sex scandal}} {{surrounding}} golf pro Tiger Woods, who had admitted to cheating {{on his wife}} Elin Nordegren with multiple partners. The Woods scandal {{had been one of}} the biggest media stories in the months since South Parks thirteenth season ended in November 2009. Series co-creator Matt Stone said the scandal provided so much material for satire that an entire season could have been dedicated to it, and the media storm surrounding Woods meant they had even less to worry about the delicacy of their parody. Stone said he was simultaneously fascinated and disgusted by Woods's public apology, so the writers <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> it in the episode. The script to [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] was not finished until after March 12, five days before the episode aired. This was in keeping with a continued practice from previous South Park seasons, in which Parker and Stone write and produce their episodes within the week before their broadcast dates in order to harness energy for the final product and keep the material fresh. In an early image of the episode released to the press, Woods is seen at his apology press conference, with Cartman standing beside him. During the production of the episode, the writers decided to incorporate the Tiger Woods scenes as part of the video game that the boys, including Cartman, are playing.|$|R

A course in introductory entomology, whether as a required or an elective subject <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> many students who will not continue the subject farther. It is at least probable, that these students will form {{over half of the}} class, and accordingly, the introductory treatment should be arranged {{on the basis of the}} greatest good to the greatest number. This will usually mean some slight knowledge of insect anatomy, particularly external anatomy, and a general survey of insects as a group, with special attention to the pests of greatest economic importance in the region where the majority of the students taking the course are likely to settle, together with a rather careful consideration of methods for the control of these pests, and with field work, so far as possible, which shall enable the students to recognize them and their work. The advanced work, following the introductory course, would naturally be for those students who wish to make entomology their profession, or who wish to use it as collateral knowledge in other lines of work, such as fruit growing, forestry, market gardening, etc. Under such conditions, a course best adapted for one, might be far from the best for the others, and it would seem that an important point to keep in mind is that the course should have elasticity. Certain portions of the work should be common to all, while other parts should be radically different, in order to best meet the needs of the different students. This means individual training, and I cannot too strongly urge that the best results come from a careful study of the plans of each student, and the shaping of quite a part of his work with direct reference to those plans...|$|R

5000|$|Cartography {{played a}} large role in the {{establishment}} of the expansive Portuguese trade route, and similarly, the trade route played its role in Portuguese cartography. Maps included certain knowledge obtained solely through the connections Portugal had made through their trade routes in Africa and the East, although many of the maps unfortunately did not survive. Within the first fleets that were sent into the East by Portugal of which there were hopes to develop an economic and trade relationship between the two empires, the leaders of the expedition specifically hired pilots who would be able to gather accurate information in a geographical and navigational sense about the Indian Ocean. There was a map smuggled into Italy in 1502 of Portuguese origin that was documented evidence that the before mentioned pilots were able to gather accurate information, and with that, they created a picture of eastern Africa and western India that was both detailed and valid. As previously mentioned, not only did cartography have a cooperative relationship with the establishment of commerce, but the same applied in a reverse relationship as well. The early expeditions created the well-known Cantino map, but they also were cause of the gathering of information dealing with trade within the Indian Ocean region, which was important in the establishment of Portugal's expansive trade routes. [...] It {{is important to note that}} not all of the information on charts and maps were limited to the seas and oceans, or even the coastlines for that matter. That was primarily the case, but there were exceptions. There were copies of maps that did include information about land areas past the coast, though they were usually reserved for library use. An example of a map that did include land information, as well as trade information that surpassed what was typically on a map, was the Catalan Atlas, which was dated 1375. When the Portuguese explored coasts, for example the coast of West Africa, cartographers and navigators would carefully record progress. They <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> the names of the places they encountered, as well as doing their best to draw the coast. Unlike Spain, however, despite the fact that there was supposedly a policy of secrecy attached to these records, it was quite often that as soon as data from the voyages was obtained, it was almost instantly recorded for public use and knowledge. Specifically, cartographers began <b>to</b> <b>include</b> actual definition in the territorial land. Cities, rivers, and mountain ranges all began to show up on some maps, whereas others still just included the bare minimum of the outline of the coast. Building from that, maps began to take on an ornamental value. No longer were the purposes just restrained to the seeking of political and economic knowledge, but they became decorative. Building upon the evolution of cartography, the Portuguese went from simply incorporating the waters they traveled to incorporating land masses such as cities, mountains, and rivers. The Portuguese expanded map-making even further by the introduction of the representation of wind systems in the making of their maps.|$|R

40|$|While the {{decision}} <b>to</b> <b>include</b> an explicit ethnic {{question in the}} 1991 Census of the United Kingdom was undoubtedly a major step forward, it is nevertheless still one whose precise meaning and significance is still clouded by {{a great deal of}} uncertainty. There are many reasons why this should be so. First of all, the concept of ethnicity itself is a rela ive newcomer to the vocabulary of social science, and no comprehensive consensus about its meaning has yet emerged. Understandings vary: while most specialists in the field insist that ethnicity is a phenomenon which must be understood in its own right, the term is nevertheless still often deployed {{as little more than a}} sanitised euphemism for the otherwise morally discredited concept of race. 2 A second set of confusions arises from the first, for there is consequently no consensus about what the purpose of asking such a question might be, nor about the kinds of issues which the answers might serve to illuminate. Even so, remarkably little attention has been paid to the underlying issues. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> the proposal <b>to</b> <b>include</b> an ethnic question in the Census precipitated a lengthy and often heated public debate, as Bulmer shows in the previous Chapter, but little or none of this was directed at establishing the meaning of the question itself...|$|R
60|$|SOCIALISM, like {{everything}} else that is vital, is rather a tendency than a strictly definable body of doctrine. A definition of Socialism <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> either <b>to</b> <b>include</b> some views which many would regard as not Socialistic, or to exclude others which claim <b>to</b> be <b>included.</b> But I think we shall come nearest to the essence of Socialism by defining it as the advocacy of communal ownership of land and capital. Communal ownership may mean ownership by a democratic State, but cannot be held <b>to</b> <b>include</b> ownership by any State which is not democratic. Communal ownership may also be understood, as Anarchist Communism understands it, {{in the sense of}} ownership by the free association {{of the men and women}} in a community without those compulsory powers which are necessary to constitute a State. Some Socialists expect communal ownership to arrive suddenly and completely by a catastrophic revolution, while others expect it to come gradually, first in one industry, then in another. Some insist upon the necessity of completeness in the acquisition of land and capital by the public, while others would be content to see lingering islands of private ownership, provided they were not too extensive or powerful. What all forms have in common is democracy and the abolition, virtual or complete, of the present capitalistic system. The distinction between Socialists, Anarchists and Syndicalists turns largely upon the kind of democracy which they desire. Orthodox Socialists are content with parliamentary democracy in the sphere of government, holding that the evils apparent in this form of constitution at present would disappear with the disappearance of capitalism. Anarchists and Syndicalists, on the other hand, object to the whole parliamentary machinery, and aim at a different method of regulating the political affairs of the community. But all alike are democratic in the sense that they aim at abolishing every kind of privilege and every kind of artificial inequality: all alike are champions of the wage- earner in existing society. All three also have much in common in their economic doctrine. All three regard capital and the wages system as a means of exploiting the laborer in the interests of the possessing classes, and hold that communal ownership, in one form or another, is the only means of bringing freedom to the producers. But within the framework of this common doctrine there are many divergences, and even among those who are strictly to be called Socialists, there is a very considerable diversity of schools.|$|R
