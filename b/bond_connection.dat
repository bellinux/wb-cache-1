Based on the better understanding of bamboo structural, physical and mechanical performance [2], bamboo is extremely potential to be utilized as an engineering structure material [3]. However, lack of strong and reliable connection restricts its further application in construction. At present, there are many types of connections used in timber structures in the residential or commercial houses, including nailed connections [4], bolted connections [5], dowel connections [6 – 9] and adhesive <b>bonded</b> steel <b>connection.</b> Epoxy <b>bonded</b> steel <b>connection,</b> which is used in bamboo timbers, is that a threaded steel bar is placed into predrilled holes in timber members and bonded with epoxy resin.

40|$|The {{effect of}} kinds and dosage of curing agent on the curing effect and {{strength}} characteristics of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) stabilized soil is very obvious. In order to reveal these effects, this paper uses cement, fly ash, lime and gypsum as main curing agent and additives to make MSW stabilized soil samples of different components and contents and its strength is obtained using unconfined compressive strength test. The {{results showed that the}} curing age, dosage of cement, fly ash, lime and gypsum have effect on the strengths of stabilized MSW soil. The bigger the content of cement and fly ash, the higher the strength of stabilized soil. But the amount of lime and gypsum has a critical value. Within the critical value, the strength of the stabilized soil increases with the increasing of the content of the additives, and decreases with the increase of the additives content if the content of the additives exceeds the critical value. The curing age has much effect on the strength of the stabilized soil. The strength of the samples for 7 days is far less than that for 28 days. This can be explained that: when the curing agent is added into the stabilized soil, the connection among the particles of the MSW soil is changed from weak connection to <b>bond</b> <b>connection,</b> and therefore the strength of the curing MSW soil is improved...|$|E
30|$|Compound 7 {{possessed a}} {{molecular}} formula of C 22 H 32 O 3 from its HREIMS, which displayed a molecular ion peak at m/z 344.2348. A {{comparison of the}} 1 H and 13 C NMR data of 7 with those of 1 revealed {{the presence of the}} 1 -(2 -methyl- 4, 6 -dihydroxyl)-phenyl group. Combined with MS spectral data, compound 7 was determined to be a neogrifolin derivative unambiguously. Unlike the other neogrifolin analogues (1 – 6) which had straight-chains as “tails”, compound 7 had a cyclohexane moiety—by C- 8 connecting to C- 13 —in its tail. It was supported by COSY correlations of H- 9 /H- 8 /H- 13 /H- 12 /H- 11, and HMBC cross peaks from Me- 22 to C- 9, C- 10 and C- 11 (Fig.  2). The remaining part of the “tail” was a 2 -(6 -methyl)- 1, 5 -heptadiene residue. This residue was connected with C- 13, because COSY correlations of H- 15 /H- 16 /H- 17, and HMBC correlations from H- 21 to C- 13 and C- 15, and from Me- 19 and - 20 to C- 18 and C- 17 (Fig.  2) were observed. In order to determine the relative stereochemistry of C- 8, C- 10 and C- 13, a ROESY experiment was performed, combined with further analysis of the coupling constants of several signals in 1 H NMR spectrum. The observed broad singlet (br. s) signal of H- 8 (δH =  3.22) in its 1 H NMR spectrum indicated that H- 8 existed as an equatorial bond in the stable boat conformation of the cyclohexane moiety, as shown in Fig.  2. Likewise, H- 13 was proposed to be in an axial position because of the doublet of triplets at δH 3.22 with coupling constants of 12.5 and 2.7  Hz, respectively. Furthermore, The ROESY correlations of H- 13 /Hax- 9 and Me- 22 /Hax- 9 revealed the same orientation of H- 13 and Me- 22. Therefore, H- 8, H- 13 and Me- 22 were deduced to be α-, α-, α- orientated. In compound 7, a ring was formed by new C–C <b>bond</b> <b>connection</b> between C- 8 and C- 13 in side chain.|$|E
40|$|Zampanolide is a microtubule-stabilising marine natural product, with {{promise as}} a cancer drug candidate. The {{potential}} therapeutic application of zampanolide has fuelled worldwide interest in its total synthesis, but few analogue {{studies have been}} reported. Analogues afford the possibility of examining the structure-activity relationships {{with a view to}} optimising for potency and medicinal viability. This project seeks to devise a new route to zampanolide and generate a series of analogues for bioactivity evaluation. The initial approach to zampanolide and a number of designed analogues was through disconnections at C 20 by an N-aldol reaction, at C 1 by Yamaguchi esterification, at C 8 -C 9 by metathesis and at C 15 -C 16 by alkynylation. During the development of fragment syntheses, problems were encountered with protection of the secondary hydroxyl group at C 19 and establishment of an aldehyde at C 15. Useful natural and analogue fragments were generated during this exploratory phase. The order of connections was revised, and effort has been put towards the improvement of the synthetic efficiency. A three-component reaction involving (triphenylphosphoranylidene) -ketene, also known as Bestmann ylide, as a linchpin was envisaged to provide the dienoate of zampanolide. This is an expanded application of Bestmann ylide and therefore the scope of this linchpin reaction was investigated using simple alcohols and aldehydes. Success in the scoping study fortified this approach, and the coupling of the C 3 -C 8 and C 16 -C 20 fragments of zampanolide proceeded with good yields and stereoselectivity of the E,Z-geometry. The planned late stage connections were tested on model substrates. The side arm attachment by a chiral boron reagent-promoted aza-aldol reaction failed to produce desired product on a simple model. However, model substrates that better account for the functionality of the zampanolide macrocycle are proposed for subsequent studies. In case these also do not succeed, reliable alternative methods described in the literature would be used. Several methods were scanned for the asymmetric alkynylation required for the C 15 -C 16 <b>bond</b> <b>connection.</b> That involving ProPhenol and diethylzinc produced an excellent yield with a model alkyne. Although the stereoselectivity of the alkynylation is yet to be optimized, it was also tested on the full zampanolide fragment generated from the Bestmann ylide reaction. A small amount of the desired product was isolated, establishing 16 out of the 18 carbons of the macrocycle. Formation of a macrocycle is close at hand...|$|E

Bolted connections are the most common type of connection used for FRP pultruded shapes and are therefore the focus of this report. Limit states and critical stresses for FRP bolted connections are explained along with the appropriate material properties that are needed to determine them. A simplified mechanics approach to determining the stresses in the FRP material and connection is presented along with a design procedure for FRP connections. A design example is given for a simple beam-to-column shear connection using three materials: FRP pultruded shapes, W-flange steel shapes, and wood sawn lumber in which the beam-to-column shear connection is compared. It is found that the FRP connection is comparable to the steel and wood connections, and all three are able to meet the requirements for the loading conditions given with reasonable results.
