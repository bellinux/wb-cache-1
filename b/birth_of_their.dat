Despite media reports that Moynahan and Brady have an acrimonious relationship, it was revealed that the two have maintained a civil relationship since the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> son.|$|E
50|$|Economists {{and critics}} {{also argue that}} the {{allowance}} creates shifting birth patterns. In December 2006, media reports suggested that German parents were seeking ways to delay the <b>births</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> children until 1 January 2007, {{so that they would}} gain access to Elterngeld of up to 25,200 euros (two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>their</b> former salary for up to a year), up from 7,200 euros per annum.|$|R

5|$|The Prince of Wales's debts {{continued}} to climb, {{and his father}} refused to aid him unless he married his cousin Princess Caroline of Brunswick. In 1795, the prince acquiesced; and they were married on 8 April 1795 at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace. The marriage, however, was disastrous; each party was unsuited to the other. The two were formally separated after the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> only child, Princess Charlotte, in 1796, and remained separated thereafter. The Prince remained attached to Maria Fitzherbert {{for the rest of}} his life, despite several periods of estrangement.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} years of their {{marriage}} were reasonably happy, leading to the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> daughter Vibeke in 1895, but as a result of P.S. Krøyer's periods of mental illness, by the early 1900s they spent ever more time apart. In 1902, Marie began an affair with the Swedish composer Hugo Alfvén, with whom she became pregnant in 1905. Thereafter she spent most of her time with Alfvén in Sweden, marrying him in 1912, three years after Krøyer had died in Skagen.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} eminent accomplishments (contributed by Queen Salote and Prince Tungi) was the <b>births</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> children. Between them, The Queen and her Consort carried the blood of all three ancient royal dynasties: the Tu'i Tonga, the Tu'i Ha'atakalaua and the Tu'i Kanokupolu. Sadly, their son (The Prince Tuku'aho) would pass away in 1936. However, the other two sons (The Prince Taufa'ahau and The Prince Sione) carried and passed on the {{combined}} bloodlines of the three ancient royal dynasties.|$|R
5|$|Through the {{connection}} of his wife's uncle, Conroy {{came to the attention}} of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth son of King George III. Conroy was appointed as an equerry in 1817, shortly before the Duke's marriage to Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. An efficient organiser, Conroy's planning ensured the Duke and Duchess' speedy return to England in time for the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first child.

5|$|After the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> daughter, Edith in 1896, Louema {{revealed}} that the father of both Edith and her older brother, Harvey (1893), was C. W. Post.

Outraged at his friend's betrayal, Beilhart ordered Post {{out of his house}} and left Battle Creek for Ohio. Louema left Jacob and took the children back to her family in Kansas in 1897. This experience undoubtedly had a profound effect upon Beilhart's view of marriage.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> daughter, {{her husband}} was {{diagnosed}} with testicular cancer.

5000|$|The {{structure}} of US justice systems makes development of maternal attachment nearly impossible.

[...] However, within many state policies, relatives are given less financial support, which can leave foster care to be more viable than kinship placement. [...] "For 50% of all incarcerated mothers, this separation becomes a lifelong sentence of permanent separation between mothers and their children." ...|$|R
50|$|After the <b>births</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{first two}} sons, Lowell Page Fillmore and Waldo Rickert Fillmore, {{the family moved}} to Kansas City, Missouri.

Myrtle subsequently recovered from chronic tuberculosis and attributed her recovery to her use of prayer and other methods learned in Weeks's classes. Subsequently Charles began to heal from his childhood accident, a development which he too attributed to following this philosophy. Charles Fillmore became a devoted student of philosophy and religion.|$|R
