50|$|Hermosa Beach usually {{enjoys a}} cool <b>breeze</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the ocean, keeping the air fresh and clean. Therefore, smog {{is less a}} problem for Hermosa Beach than {{elsewhere}} around Los Angeles.|$|R
2500|$|The name [...] "Ozone Park" [...] {{was chosen}} for the {{development}} to [...] "lure buyers {{with the idea of}} refreshing <b>breezes</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the Atlantic Ocean to a park-like community," [...] with [...] "ozone" [...] meaning not the alternate form of oxygen, but [...] "fresh healthy air, especially from the sea." ...|$|R
60|$|The little waves murmured as {{they rolled}} lazily up the beach. Somewhere behind {{the trees in}} the gardens a band had begun to play. The <b>breeze,</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the blue Mediterranean, was charged with salt and happiness. And from a seat on the promenade, a young man swept the crowd with a defiant gaze.|$|R
50|$|The club {{is housed}} on a generous outcrop of land jutting {{out into the}} Arabian Sea, with a {{retaining}} wall that has a steep drop into the sea below. A landscape full of shrubs and palm trees, the soothing sound of waves below and a delicately cool <b>breeze</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the sea come {{together to create a}} charming ambience.|$|R
50|$|Santa Monica usually enjoys cool <b>breezes</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the ocean, {{which tend}} to keep the air fresh and clean. Therefore, smog {{is less of a}} problem for Santa Monica than {{elsewhere}} around Los Angeles. However, in the autumn months of September through November, the Santa Ana winds will sometimes blow from the east, bringing smoggy and hot inland air to the beaches.|$|R
25|$|However, the {{architecture}} {{had to be}} adapted to suit the extremes of the Mediterranean and desert climate. White and light colors reflected the heat. Walls not only provided privacy but protected against the sun. Large areas of glass that let in the light, {{a key element of}} the Bauhaus style in Europe, were replaced with small recessed windows that limited the heat and glare. Long narrow balconies, each shaded by the balcony above it, allowed residents to catch the <b>breeze</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the sea to the west. Slanted roofs were replaced with flat ones, providing a common area where residents could socialize in the cool of the evening.|$|R
60|$|After breakfast next morning, we sallied {{forth to}} see the lions. Such a delicious <b>breeze</b> was <b>blowing</b> <b>in,</b> <b>from</b> the north, as made the walk delightful: though the pavement-stones, and stones of the walls and houses, were far too hot to have a hand laid on them comfortably.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{wonderful}} morning. The sky was an unclouded blue, and a fresh <b>breeze</b> was <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the sea. I think that something of the exhilaration of approaching spring must have stirred me, for quite suddenly the dull depression with which I had started my walk left me, and I found myself alert and full of schemes.|$|R
25|$|Malaita's {{climate is}} {{extremely}} wet. It {{is located in}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone ("Doldrums"), with its fickle weather patterns. The sun is at zenith over Malaita, and thus the effect is most pronounced, in November and February. Trade winds come during the southern hemisphere's winter, and from about April to August they blow from the southeast fairly steadily. During the summer, fringes of monsoon blow over the island. Because of the surrounding sea, air temperatures are fairly consistent, with a difference between daily highs and lows averaging to 13.6°F However, across the year, the difference is much less; the mean daily temperature in the warmest month is only 3.4°F warmer than that of the coolest. Rainfall is heavy and there is constant high humidity. The most common daily pattern follows an adiabatic process, with a calm, clear morning, followed by a <b>breeze</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> higher pressures over the sea, culminating in a cloudy and drizzly afternoon. At night, the weather pattern reverses, and drizzle and heavy dew dissipate the cloud cover for the morning. Tropical cyclones are the only violent weather, but they can be destructive.|$|R
60|$|How long he {{lay there}} {{unconscious}} he never knew; but as reason slowly reasserted itself in his semi-conscious state {{he was aware that}} he lay in a cool bed upon the whitest of linen in a bright and cheery room, and that upon one side close to him was an open window, the delicate hangings of which were fluttering in a soft summer <b>breeze</b> which <b>blew</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> a sun-kissed orchard of ripening fruit which he could see without--an old orchard in which soft, green grass grew between the laden trees, and where the sun filtered through the foliage; and upon the dappled greensward a little child was playing with a frolicsome puppy.|$|R
50|$|The bay {{has a small}} {{tidal range}} of 0.6 m at neap tides and 1.8 m at spring tides, and a double high water. Maximum monthly {{temperatures}} range {{from an average of}} 8 C in January to 27 C in August; minimums range from 3 C to 16 C. Ground temperatures on the mudflats can fall below freezing in winter. The prevailing winds are from the west or southwest, but sea <b>breezes</b> can also <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the south and southeast.|$|R
60|$|While {{preparations}} {{were being}} made, Adolay and Nootka {{went to the}} bay where the canoe was lying--a short distance from the village, {{on the other side}} of a high cliff that sheltered the bay from any <b>breeze</b> that might <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the sea. The light craft was turned bottom up on the beach, and the two girls carried it down to the water's edge. Launching it, Nootka got in first, and Adolay was preparing to follow when a boyish shout arrested her, and she saw Anteek come skimming round the point in his kayak, wielding his double-bladed paddle with great dexterity and power. In a few seconds the kayak was alongside the canoe and the boy stepped out upon the shore.|$|R
60|$|Therewith {{there was}} a kind of groan further off, and as Aurelia felt a hand on her dress, her fight and {{distress}} at the duality were complete. While, in the dark, the hands were still groping for her, she eluded them, and succeeded in carrying out Harriet's manoeuvre so far that a quick bright flame leapt forth, lighting up the whole room, and revealing two--yes, two! But it did not die away! In her haste, and in the darkness, she had poured the whole contents of the bottle on the phosphoric cotton, and dropped both without knowing it on a chintz curtain. A fresh evening <b>breeze</b> was <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the window, open behind the shutters, and in one second the curtain was a flaming, waving sheet. Some one sprang up to tear it down, leaping on a table in the window. The table overbalanced, the heavy iron curtain-rod came out suddenly, and {{there was a}} fall, the flaming mass covering the fallen! The glare shone on a strange white face and head as well as on Jumbo's black one, and with a trampling and crushing the fire died down, quenched as suddenly as it began, and all was obscurity again.|$|R

50|$|Fishermen's jetties {{along the}} Langat River in Kuala Langat are where people from Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya go to {{for a quick}} weekend getaway to enjoy fresh seafood and a <b>breeze</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> their faces.|$|R
60|$|But Ginger {{was intent}} on the {{lighting}} of his cigarette, a delicate operation with the <b>breeze</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> through the open window. His head was bent, and he had formed his hands into a protective framework which half hid his face.|$|R
60|$|They {{leaned over}} the rail together. The young officer saluted and withdrew. A {{freshening}} <b>breeze</b> <b>blew</b> <b>in</b> their faces and the sunshine danced upon the foam-flecked sea. The harbour was lively with small craft, an aeroplane was circling overhead, and out in the Roads several warships were lying anchored.|$|R
60|$|He obeyed, turning {{round and}} making some mute sign to the captain. She walked swiftly {{up the stairs}} after a frightened glance down the {{corridor}} to their state-rooms. A fresh <b>breeze</b> <b>blew</b> <b>in</b> their faces as they stepped out on deck, and Mr. Sabin glanced at her bare neck and arms.|$|R
60|$|Lightfoot the Deer {{traveled}} {{on through the}} Green Forest, straight ahead <b>in</b> the direction <b>from</b> which the Merry Little <b>Breezes</b> were <b>blowing.</b> Every few steps he would raise his delicate nose and test all the scents that the Merry Little Breezes were bringing. So long as he kept the Merry Little <b>Breezes</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> his face, he could be sure {{whether or not there}} was danger ahead of him.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Brown looked fixedly at the cables, {{fluttering}} {{a little}} <b>in</b> the <b>breeze</b> which <b>blew</b> <b>in</b> through the half-open window.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} not {{the arm of a}} patriot, you at least possess a most loyal imagination, Miss Plowden," [...] said Griffith, laughing; [...] "this soft <b>breeze</b> <b>blows</b> <b>in</b> the {{direction}} of the fens of Holland, instead of the broad plains of America.--Thank God, there come the signs of day, at last! unless the currents have swept the ship far to the north, we shall surely see her with the light." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{preceding}} night camp {{had been}} made on a level spot in the cedars back of the promontory. But manifestly Anson {{did not expect to}} remain there long. For, after breakfast, the packs {{had been made}} up and the horses stood saddled and bridled. They were restless and uneasy, tossing bits and fighting flies. The sun, now half-way to meridian, was hot and no <b>breeze</b> <b>blew</b> <b>in</b> that sheltered spot.|$|R
50|$|Supporting the state's {{abundant}} {{wildlife and}} lush vegetation are the monsoons. They stretch {{from the late}} May to September, but there are intermittent rains even in the winters. High temperatures cause the rivers to swell with melted snow from Himalayas. Winter begins in late November and continues till February. Cool, gentle <b>breezes</b> <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> January and February keeping the days clear and sunny. Winter mornings in most of Assam are marked by a dense fog.|$|R
60|$|Ken knew {{he could}} rely on the {{chattering}} of the sparrows in the woodbine round his window. They always woke him, and this morning was no exception. It was after six and a soft, balmy <b>breeze</b> <b>blew</b> <b>in.</b> Ken got up noiselessly and dressed. Raymond snored in blissful ignorance of the conspiracy. Presently a gentle tapping upon the door told Ken that Reddy was in the hall. Ken let him in and they held a whispered consultation.|$|R
60|$|They {{stepped into}} the hall of a great building, and {{took one of the}} interminable row of lifts. A few minutes later they were seated at a side table in a dining room {{on the top floor of}} one of the huge modern skyscrapers. Below them {{stretched}} a silent panorama of the city; beyond, a picturesque view of the river. A fresh <b>breeze</b> <b>blew</b> <b>in</b> through the opened window. They were above the noise, even, of the street cars.|$|R
60|$|Friday, July 27, 1890.--Feeling fairly these days, {{and even}} jovial--sleep and {{appetite}} {{good enough to}} be thankful for--had a dish of Maryland blackberries, some good rye bread and a cup of tea, for my breakfast--relish' d all--fine weather--bright sun to-day--pleasant northwest <b>breeze</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> the open window as I sit here in my big rattan chair--two great fine roses (white and red, blooming, fragrant, sent by mail by W.

60|$|It met at Mrs. Moore's and Mrs. Moore was {{especially}} gracious to Old Lady Lloyd, {{and insisted on}} her taking the wicker rocker in the parlour. The Old Lady would rather {{have been in the}} sitting-room with the young girls, but she submitted for courtesy's sake--and she had her reward. Her chair was just behind the parlour door, and presently Janet Moore and Sylvia Gray came and sat on the stairs in the hall outside, where a cool <b>breeze</b> <b>blew</b> <b>in</b> through the maples before the front door.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Immortal Self (Ātman) is the sun {{shining in}} the sky, he is the <b>breeze</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> space, he is the fire burning on the altar, he is the guest {{dwelling}} in the house; he is in all men, {{he is in the}} gods, he is in the ether, he is wherever there is truth; he is the fish that is born in waters, he is the plant that grows in the soil, he is the river that gushes from the mountain, - he is the changeless reality, the illimitable. [...] " [...] - (Katha Upanishad II.ii.2) ...|$|R
60|$|The sun, sinking {{behind a}} lofty western peak, brought {{on an early}} but {{lingering}} twilight, and the expedition plodded on through the evil forest--the place of mystery and fear, of death swift and silent and horrible, of brutish appetite and degraded instinct, of human life that still wallowed in the primeval slime, of savagery degenerate and abysmal. No slightest <b>breezes</b> <b>blew</b> <b>in</b> the gloomy silence, {{and the air was}} stale and humid and suffocating. The sweat poured unceasingly from their bodies, and in their nostrils was the heavy smell of rotting vegetation and of black earth that was a-crawl with fecund life.|$|R
6000|$|So she argued, fought, wept, surrendered, {{and went}} to battle again. While all about her, John and his sister, moved tranquilly to their daily duties, calm as the cattle in the meadows. To the discerning eye it was a {{wonderful}} sight to see that dark, gloomy, restless girl seated opposite those serene, almost stolid faces, to whom [...] "the world" [...] was a <b>breeze</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> the tree-tops. She had the bearing of a rebellious royal captive--a duchess in exile. Mrs. Diehl and the hired man were the peasants who waited upon her, but ate with her--and her father was the secure free-holder, to whom kings were obscure, world-distant diseases.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded on 24 July 2012. The company name [...] "Ainokaze Toyama Railway" [...] was {{announced}} on 30 May 2013. Ainokaze refers to a north-easterly <b>breeze</b> that <b>blows</b> <b>in</b> the region in spring and summer, and is mentioned in the Manyoshu collection of Japanese poetry.|$|R
60|$|The {{lights were}} lowered, and an {{attentive}} waiter hovered round Anna's cloak. They {{left the room}} amongst the last, and Ennison had almost to elbow {{his way through a}} group of acquaintances who had all some pretext for detaining him, to which he absolutely refused to listen. They entered a hansom and turned on to the Embankment. The two great hotels on their right were still ablaze with lights. On their left the river, with its gloomy pile of buildings on the opposite side, and a huge revolving advertisement throwing its strange reflection upon the black water. A fresh cool <b>breeze</b> <b>blew</b> <b>in</b> their faces. Anna leaned back with half closed eyes.|$|R
60|$|A little <b>breeze</b> <b>blew</b> <b>in</b> {{between the}} slender pillars delightfully fresh and cool, and Dom Clemente Figuera, {{who had taken}} off his heavy kepi, lay in a cane chair with a smile in his half-closed eyes. The ten o'clock breakfast had just been cleared away, but two cups of bitter black coffee still stood upon the table beside a bundle of cigars and a flask of light red wine. He was, as he now and then laughingly admitted, usually in an {{excellent}} humor after breakfast, and one could have fancied just then {{that he had not}} a care in the world. There were, however, men who said {{that in the case of}} Dom Clemente tranquillity was not always a favorable sign.|$|R
60|$|I {{saw that}} island first {{when it was}} neither night nor morning. The moon was to the west, setting, but still broad and bright. To the east, and right {{amidships}} of the dawn, which was all pink, the day-star sparkled like a diamond. The land <b>breeze</b> <b>blew</b> <b>in</b> our faces, and smelt strong of wild lime and vanilla: other things besides, but these were the most plain; and the chill of it set me sneezing. I should say I had been for years on a low island near the line, living {{for the most part}} solitary among natives. Here was a fresh experience: even the tongue would be quite strange to me; and the look of these woods and mountains, and the rare smell of them, renewed my blood.|$|R
60|$|By {{six o'clock}} a <b>breeze</b> <b>blew</b> <b>in</b> off an icefield; and by seven {{the water was}} more purple than blue; and by half-past seven there was a patch of rough gold-beater's skin round the Scilly Isles, and Durrant's face, as he sat steering, was of the colour of a red lacquer box {{polished}} for generations. By nine all the fire and confusion {{had gone out of}} the sky, leaving wedges of apple-green and plates of pale yellow; and by ten the lanterns on the boat were making twisted colours upon the waves, elongated or squat, as the waves stretched or humped themselves. The beam from the lighthouse strode rapidly across the water. Infinite millions of miles away powdered stars twinkled; but the waves slapped the boat, and crashed, with regular and appalling solemnity, against the rocks.|$|R
