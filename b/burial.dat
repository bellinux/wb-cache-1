5|$|<b>Burial</b> 265 {{was found}} {{at the base of}} the {{stairway}} of Terrace 1 Structure 2 in the acropolis. Ceramics associated with the <b>burial</b> have been dated to the Middle Preclassic Period. This <b>burial</b> is the only evidence yet found of such early activity at the site. It consists of the <b>burial</b> of a seated infant together with a newborn. The <b>burial</b> was laid out upon a layer of large stones and was accompanied by a plate and other ceramics as a funerary offering. The child's skull was found underneath the plate itself. Burnt stones and earth were found next to the <b>burial.</b>|$|E
5|$|Evidence from {{excavated}} Liao <b>burial</b> sites {{indicates that}} animistic or shamanistic practices were fused with Buddhism and other practices in marriage and <b>burial</b> ceremonies. Both animal and human sacrifices {{have been found}} in Liao tombs, alongside indications of Buddhist practice. Indications of Daoist, zodiac, and Zoroastrian influences have also been found in Liao <b>burial</b> sites.|$|E

50|$|There are 14 war cemeteries and plots in Queensland, {{including}} the one at Atherton: Lutwyche War Cemetery (386 <b>burials)</b> and Cremation Memorial, Bundaberg War Cemetery (35 <b>burials),</b> Ipswich War Cemetery (68 <b>burials),</b> Kingaroy War Cemetery (22 <b>burials),</b> Maryborough (10 <b>burials),</b> Rockhampton War Cemetery (36 <b>burials),</b> Toowoomba War Cemetery (44 <b>burials,</b> Drayton and Toowoomba Cemetery), Townsville War Cemetery (222 <b>burials),</b> Cairns War Cemetery (98 <b>burials),</b> Charters Towers War Cemetery (33 <b>burials),</b> Gympie War Cemetery (5 <b>burials),</b> Warwick War Cemetery (21 <b>burials,</b> Warwick General Cemetery), and Woombye War Cemetery (26 <b>burials).</b> In addition {{there are a number}} of individual war graves in civil cemeteries throughout Queensland. The war cemeteries and individual graves in civil cemeteries are maintained by the Office of Australian War Graves, a branch of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The Office of Australian War Graves is the agent of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Norfolk Island.|$|R
25|$|As of 1995, 26 <b>burials</b> {{had been}} {{excavated}} at Topoxte. Two <b>burials</b> were interred in rough cists, two were interred in caves {{and one in}} a funerary urn. Eighteen <b>burials</b> were individual, four were multiple <b>burials</b> and four consisted of single <b>burials</b> with additional skulls interred with the deceased.|$|R

5|$|Structure A-13 is a radial pyramid. Excavations {{uncovered}} a mass <b>burial</b> (<b>Burial</b> 4) with parts of eleven people, including {{two women and}} a child. This was not a traditional Classic Maya <b>burial</b> and has been dated to AD 930, very late in the occupation of the site.|$|E
5|$|To the {{immediate}} south-west {{of the church}} building, St Botolph's Aldersgate owned an irregularly shaped churchyard enclosed by Aldersgate Street to the east, the Christ Church Greyfriars <b>burial</b> ground to the west, housing and the <b>burial</b> ground of St Leonard, Foster Lane, {{to the south and}} housing along Little Britain to the north. The churchyard was used as a <b>burial</b> ground and as a public open space. As with other City churchyards, as the amount of available <b>burial</b> space in London failed {{to keep pace with the}} growing population it came to be used exclusively as a <b>burial</b> ground.|$|E
50|$|The <b>burials</b> from Lovelock Cave do {{not appear}} to be similar to the earlier <b>burials</b> from Spirit Cave or to the later <b>burials</b> from Stillwater Marsh. The eight <b>burials</b> from Lovelock Cave were buried at various times between 4,500 and 900 years B.P.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 This project hypothesizes {{that the}} use of {{multiple}} ground-based remote sensing methods can collectively characterize the geophysical signatures of four marked human <b>burials</b> at the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians historic period cemetery. If the geophysical signatures of the marked <b>burials</b> can be characterized, these signatures may be used to located unmarked <b>burials</b> within the Siletz cemetery. To investigate this hypothesis, several research questions focused on the results from topographic, cesium gradiometer, and ground-penetrating radar surveys. A 15 m x 15 m region of the cemetery containing four marked <b>burials</b> defines the survey region. The results of each survey were individually and collectively examined to identify the characteristic geophysical signatures of the four marked <b>burials.</b> The topographic and magnetic surveys identified geophysical anomalies spatially associated with the some of the marked <b>burials.</b> The ground-penetrating radar survey was the most productive by identifying geophysical anomalies spatially associated with all four marked <b>burials.</b> Even though signals from the <b>burials</b> appeared with mixed results, it proved difficult to characterize the geophysical signatures of the <b>burials</b> in the individual and collective geophysical data. Without a characterization of the geophysical signature of the marked <b>burials,</b> it is difficult to identify unmarked <b>burials</b> at the Siletz cemetery. Due {{to the success of the}} radar at "seeing" all four marked <b>burials</b> it may be possible to identify areas free of unmarked <b>burials...</b>|$|R

5|$|A Corded Ware culture princely <b>burial</b> {{was found}} in Szczytna, Subcarpathian Voivodeship. The grave, well-secured three meters below the surface, {{contained}} a man's skeleton and a funerary gift collection of highly valuable copper decorations, containers, stone tools and arrowheads. The uniquely equipped <b>burial</b> of a warrior-chief has close analogies with finds from Transylvania, a testimony to geographically extensive contacts of Corded Ware culture nomadic people.|$|E
5|$|After the Reformation, the Mass and Purgatory were {{rejected}} by the Kirk, along with the efficacy of good works and prayers for the dead. In place of elaborate processions and masses at a funeral there was a simple service, where the body was taken to its resting place without singing and readings and interred soberly without ceremony. Unlike other reformed churches the Kirk also rejected <b>burial</b> inside the church, which were now seen as unseemly for a house of prayer. This caused friction with traditional rights, particularly of local notables, to be buried with their ancestors. The use of <b>burial</b> aisles, an extension projecting for {{the main body of}} the church, almost exclusively used for <b>burial</b> and commemoration, represented a uniquely Scottish solution to this problem. For most ranks in society the kirkyard remained the desired place of <b>burial.</b> From the seventeenth century burials were increasingly marked by gravestones, often including inscriptions that indicated affection for and the virtues of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Shaft Grave era, a new {{and more}} {{imposing}} type of elite <b>burial</b> emerged, the Tholos: large circular <b>burial</b> chambers with high vaulted roofs and a straight entry passage lined with stone.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>burials</b> in the Mehrgarh site. There were {{individual}} <b>burials</b> where a single individual was enclosed in narrow mud walls and collective <b>burials</b> with thin mud brick walls within which skeletons of six different individuals were discovered. The bodies in the collective <b>burials</b> were kept in a flexed position and were laid east to west. Child bones were found in large jars or urn <b>burials</b> (4000~3300 BCE).|$|R

50|$|Excavations in the {{necropolis}} of Vicenne-Campochiaro near Boiano {{which dates}} from the 7th century, found among 130 <b>burials</b> that there were 13 human <b>burials</b> alongside horses along with artifacts of Germanic and Avar origin. Horse <b>burials</b> are characteristic of Central Asian horse-nomads, and therefore these <b>burials</b> are clearly those of the Bulgar settlers of Molise and Campania.|$|R
5|$|<b>Burial</b> 23 was a royal tomb {{inserted}} {{by destroying}} the second {{version of the}} access stairway of Temple 33. The individual interred within the tomb has not been identified but the tomb {{is one of two}} proposed locations for the <b>burial</b> of the late 7th-century king Nuun Ujol Chaak. The tomb was cut into the bedrock under the temple, to the south of the <b>burial</b> of Siyaj Chan K'awiil II. The king appears to have been hastily interred in a tomb that was still being prepared while the <b>burial</b> took place, since plaster from the walls was splashed on some of the grave goods and a flint pick was accidentally left behind by a workman. The body of the king was laid upon a litter painted with cinnabar and overlain with jaguar-pelts; the corpse was laid out on the pelts and covered in layers of marine shells.|$|E
5|$|<b>Burial</b> 24 was {{an elite}} status <b>burial</b> {{inserted}} into the rubble core of Temple 33 during {{the final phase of}} the pyramid's construction. The tomb contained painted ceramic dishes that appear to name Nuun Ujol Chaak's father and grandfather, who both preceded him as rulers of the city.|$|E
5|$|<b>Burial</b> 6 was a cist located {{under the}} first chamber of the Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). It had been heavily looted, to an extent {{that it was not}} {{possible}} to determine if the scattered human remains of at least four people belonged to one <b>burial</b> or several. The bones belonged to two children and two young adult females and fragments of ceramic offerings were also identified.|$|E
50|$|During {{investigations}} {{carried out}} between 1984 and 1987, 26 <b>burials</b> were excavated, of which 23 were found under domestic structures. 24 of the <b>burials</b> were oriented east-west with the skull towards the west; the remaining 2 <b>burials</b> were oriented north-south with the skull to the north. The {{majority of the}} <b>burials</b> were covered with red pigment.|$|R

5|$|<b>Burial</b> 69 {{was found}} {{in front of the}} base of Group 18 Structure 2. The remains were {{extremely}} poorly preserved but the deceased may have been laid out on their back with the head towards the north. Associated funerary offerings included a tripod plate, a polychrome vase and a flint projectile point. The <b>burial</b> was securely dated to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Burial</b> PNT-003 was interred at {{the same}} time as <b>Burial</b> PNT-002. The {{deceased}} was an adult male aged between 36 and 55 years old; he was lying face down with a northwest-southeast orientation. The remains were very poorly preserved but the upper canines were both decorated with pyrite incrustations. The deceased was not accompanied by jewellery or funerary offerings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Burial</b> customs, {{at least}} in {{southern}} Poland, included raising kurgans. The urn with the ashes {{was placed on the}} mound or on a post thrust into the ground. In that position, few such urns survived, which may be the reason why Slavic <b>burial</b> sites in Poland are rare. All dead, regardless of social status, were cremated and afforded a <b>burial,</b> according to Arab testimonies (one {{from the end of the}} 9th century and another one from about 930). A Slavic funeral feast practice was also mentioned earlier by Theophylact Simocatta.|$|E
500|$|Although at its {{founding}} the LNC {{had hoped to}} handle 50,000 <b>burials</b> per year and even without being granted a monopoly on London <b>burials</b> had planned for 10,000 per year, Brookwood Cemetery was never as popular as hoped. At {{the time of the}} railway's closure only 203,041 <b>burials</b> had been conducted, and the rate was steadily falling; on the LNC's 150th anniversary in November 1994, a total of 231,730 <b>burials</b> had been conducted.

An investigation into how the media portray deviant <b>burials</b> and whether they are quicker to call deviant or decapitated <b>burials</b> ‘vampire burials’ in Eastern European examples due to their history of vampire folklore will also take place. Finally, comments made by the public on these online news stories will be analysed in order to understand how society is reacting and viewing these stories within their wider context. The main focus will be on decapitation <b>burials</b> suggested to be ‘vampire’ <b>burials,</b> or <b>burials</b> used solely for the purpose of burying those who were feared would return as vampires once deceased...|$|R
