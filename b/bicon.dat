5000|$|<b>Bicon</b> {{has been}} called “the {{smallest}} of the large implant companies.” Manufactured in the U.S.A. for nearly 30 years, <b>Bicon</b> implants have been generally well received. [...] Because <b>Bicon</b> implants utilize a unique press-fit system instead of a screw, many clinicians have been hesitant to implement their use. [...] Other clinicians praise the <b>Bicon</b> implant design for both its ease of use, versatility, and cost effectiveness. [...] Like other dental companies that use or have used hydroxyapatite coated implants or hydroxyapatite derivatives (e.g. Zimmer, Straumann, Nobel Biocare, Dentsply, etc.), <b>Bicon</b> too {{has been criticized for}} the use of hydroxyapatite. <b>Bicon</b> implants have also been criticized for their small size; however, following a series of scientific studies, these concerns were shown to have been unwarranted.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bicon</b> {{has been}} in {{operation}} since June 1994. Prior to <b>Bicon,</b> its main product line was under the ownership of two other entities, Driskell Bioengineering (1985-1987) and Stryker Corporation (1988-1994) of Kalamazoo Michigan. The following section briefly describes {{the history of the}} <b>Bicon</b> company and the dental implant products that it offers.|$|E
50|$|In 2002 <b>BiCon</b> {{hosted the}} first Cake Awards {{recognising}} {{the breadth of}} contributions made to the bisexual community in the UK. Further Cake Awards have been presented at <b>BiCon</b> every few years since.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to dental implants, <b>Bicon</b> also offers implant-abutments, β-tricalcium phosphate, and other dental restorative materials. As {{mentioned in the}} introduction, {{one of the reasons}} <b>Bicon</b> implants are notable (and also a source of criticism) is because of their small size. <b>Bicon</b> implants—referred to as short or ultrashort—can be as short as 5.0 mm. This allows the implants to be placed in regions that would otherwise require a sinus lift or bone graft.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bicon</b> Dental Implants is {{a privately}} owned company located in Boston, MA. The company specializes in short dental {{implants}} that use a locking taper or cold welding connection {{to secure the}} abutment to the implant. <b>Bicon</b> is notable and worthy of mention for the following three reasons: First, <b>Bicon</b> implants are extremely short in length. The size of <b>Bicon</b> implants {{allow them to be}} placed in regions that are crowded with natural teeth and/or implants, or in regions that would otherwise require bone grafting.Second, the implants do not have the screw-form design typical of other available implants. [...] Third, the abutments are connected to the implant via a locking taper. This is notable from both a medical and engineering standpoint as no other implant company offers an implant with a biological seal at the implant/abutment interface; almost all other implants possess an internal screw to connect their abutments.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Bicon</b> dental {{implants}} {{have been}} successfully functioning in patients {{since the inception of}} the product line in 1985. Implants retrieved after 18 years show evidence of lamellar bone consisting of multiple layers and multiple osteonic structures.

50|$|A {{range of}} cities and towns have hosted it since. Over time <b>BiCon</b> has evolved to fit {{with the needs of}} the community. The word 'conference' has been largely {{replaced}} by 'convention', but there is still a political and campaigning side to the event. In recent years the momentum behind the event has spawned a number of offshoots, such as 'BabyBiCon', BiFest and the 'Bi Academic Conference' BiReCon, which have concentrated themselves on particular aspects covered by <b>BiCon.</b>|$|E

50|$|The UK <b>BiCon</b> (more {{formally}} {{known as}} the UK National Bisexual Convention or UK National Bisexual Conference), is {{the largest and most}} consistent annual gathering of the United Kingdom's bisexual community. It is also the world's longest running bisexual community event.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001 BCN {{published}} [...] "An A-Z of Bi Group Running", {{a resource}} for helping build local community support. It was written by Jen Yockney based on five years of organising Manchester-based bisexual community group BiPhoria and <b>BiCon</b> workshops about bi group organising.|$|E
50|$|A BiFest is {{a one-day}} festival celebrating bisexuality, usually with {{workshops}} and discussions {{during the day}} and social events in the evening, complementing the larger convention <b>BiCon.</b> Currently there have been at least sixteen BiFests around the UK since 1999, with the busiest attracting around 130 people.|$|E
50|$|The {{style of}} implant offered by <b>Bicon</b> can trace its {{provenance}} to the Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, where in 1968 the US Army Medical Research and Development Command Dental Research Division funded a project aimed at developing prosthetics {{to address the}} influx of craniofacial injuries sustained by personnel in the escalating Vietnam conflict.|$|E
50|$|Following its {{purchase}} from DB Bioengineering, Stryker held {{control of}} the DB Precision Fin Implant System for 7 years. Owing to its large size, {{as well as being}} more accustomed to dealing with purchasing agents at large hospitals, Stryker lacked the infrastructure necessary for direct interaction and sales with private practice dentists. In late 1993, Stryker made plans to sell the DB Precision Fin Implant System. Catching wind of the sale, Dr. Vincent Morgan (current owner and president of the company) along with other business partners, formed a group whose purpose was the acquisition of the implant system. In 1994, Stryker sold the DB Precision Fin Implant System to a group based in Boston which, at that point in time, had been renamed <b>Bicon</b> Dental Implants or simply <b>Bicon</b> (a name that is a portmanteau of the Latin “bi”—meaning two—and “con”—indicating the simple two-part design of the implant/abutment connection).|$|E

Pandey acquired ownership of the region from the British East India Company in 1766 after the Battle of Plassey. He declared the marketplaces {{on the banks of}} the Shitalakshya river as endowed property to pay for expenses for the worship of the God Narayan. Subsequently, the region was named Narayanganj.|$|E

5000|$|While {{the format}} does vary, the common format {{is a long}} weekend over 4 days {{consisting}} of workshops, discussions, meetings and social events. Although being billed as a [...] "bisexual" [...] event, it is open to partners of bisexuals, supporters, non-bisexuals, non-definers, and anyone else interested in issues relevant to bisexuals. To that extent it can often be characterised as a [...] of the sexual freedom and queer movements. Each <b>BiCon</b> event usually attracts between 200 and 400 people.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, {{bromomethane}} is {{the preferred}} fumigant of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources for most organic goods imported into Australia. The department conducts methyl bromide fumigation certification for both domestic and foreign fumigators who can then fumigate containers destined for Australia. A list of alternative fumigants is available for goods imported from Europe (known as the <b>BICON</b> database), where methyl bromide fumigation has been banned. Alternatively, the department allows containers from Europe to be fumigated with methyl bromide on arrival to Australia.|$|E
5000|$|That {{following}} October the Edinburgh Bisexual Group took up {{the torch}} and ran an event called [...] "Bisexuality and the Politics of Sex". This established the idea of conferences moving around the nation. The next was run by a bisexual women's group in London. By this point the community was starting {{to know what they}} wanted from <b>BiCon</b> - a chance to meet other bisexuals (and their allies) from across the country, discuss sexuality issues, relax in the company of likeminded folk and network.|$|E
5000|$|Unbeknownst to its creators at the time, the <b>Bicon</b> implant design (i.e. {{namely the}} use of fins or plateaus, along with a {{hemispherical}} base) took advantage of a biological phenomenon called load bearing platform switching (LBPS). [...] Briefly, platform switching occurs when the diameters of the implant and abutment are unequal. [...] LBPS results when the hemispherical base of the abutment generates a load onto the tissue below it. This mechanical stimuli induces bone repair and maintenance and results in crestal bone gain coronal to the implant.|$|E

5000|$|Biconical (or [...] "bicon") antennas {{are often}} used in {{electromagnetic}} interference (EMI) testing either for immunity testing, or emissions testing. While the <b>bicon</b> is very broadband, it exhibits poor efficiency at low frequencies, resulting in low field strengths {{when compared to the}} input power. Log periodic dipole arrays, Yagi-Uda antennas, and reverberation chambers have shown to achieve much higher field strengths for the power input than a simple biconical antenna in an anechoic chamber. However, reverberation chambers, especially, are poor choices when the goal is to fully characterize a modulated or impulse signal rather than merely measuring peak and average spectrum energy content.|$|E
50|$|In the mid 1980s, Driskell and his {{partners}} formed a company called DB Bioengineering. DB Bioengineering received pre-market notification in October, 1985 for the implant Driskell and his team had developed at Batelle—now known as the DB Precision Fin Implant System. Two short years later, in 1987, DB engineering—along with the DB Precision Fin Implant System—were sold to the multinational conglomerate, the Stryker Corporation. At this juncture, the DB Precision Fin Implant System possessed the qualities that separated it (along with modern <b>Bicon</b> implants) from its competitors: a sloping shoulder, specialized titanium instrumentation, and a slow speed drilling system. Slow speed drilling was included {{in order to prevent}} the thermal damage induced by the high speeds conventional drilling.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to {{serving as the}} LGA's lead member for diversity, Lord has been an active advocate for equality {{across a range of}} fields, most notably for LGBT people. In April 2012 he was profiled as an openly bisexual politician in Stonewall's role model publication sent to thousands of schools and employers. He has been a trustee or board member of The Albert Kennedy Trust; Anne Frank Trust (UK); British Youth Council; Pride Trust; and Refugee Council. In November 2012, it was announced that he had been appointed to the Ministerial steering group for the review of the Public Sector Equality Duty, which reported in September 2013. In April 2015, he was elected as Bisexual People's Representative to the Community Advisory Board for Pride in London having already been appointed a trustee of bisexual charity <b>BiCon</b> Continuity and research and activist group BiUK.|$|E
5000|$|Barker's {{main area}} of {{research}} is human sexuality, gender and romantic relationships, {{with a focus on}} the experiences of people in sexual, gender and relationship communities located outside the mainstream - particularly polyamorous, kink, non-binary and bisexual communities. Theoretically their work draws on social constructionism, existentialism and Buddhist philosophy. Barker, with co-author Darren Langdridge, has published two edited collections on sadomasochism and on non-monogamy. [...] and a recent book for mental health professionals (co-authored with Christina Richards). Barker founded the journal of Psychology & Sexuality together with Langdridge in 2010, and they co-edited it until 2017. Barker co-organizes a number of seminar series and conferences, notably the Critical Sexology series, an interdisciplinary project co-organized with Lisa Downing and Robert Gillett; BiReCon (a biennial research conference which takes place prior to the annual <b>BiCon</b> event) and the Pornified and Sense About Sex Projects.|$|E

5000|$|Bisexual {{people also}} {{continued}} to be active in the larger LGBT movement. The first <b>BiCon</b> UK (a get-together in the United Kingdom for bisexuals, allies and friends) was held in 1984. In 1986 BiPOL's Autumn Courtney was elected co-chair of San Francisco's Lesbian Gay Freedom Day Pride Parade Committee; {{she was the first}} openly bisexual person to hold this sort of position in the United States. In 1987 a group of 75 bisexuals marched in the 1987 March On Washington For Gay and Lesbian Rights, which was the first nationwide bisexual gathering. The article [...] "The Bisexual Movement: Are We Visible Yet?", by Lani Ka'ahumanu, appeared in the official Civil Disobedience Handbook for the March. It was the first article about bisexuals and the emerging bisexual movement to be published in a national lesbian or gay publication. The North American Bisexual Network, the first national bisexual organization, was first thought of at this gathering, though not founded until three years later (see below.) NABN would later change its name to BiNet USA. Also in 1987, Barney Frank became the first U.S. congressman to come out as gay of his own volition; he was inspired in part by the death of Stewart McKinney, a closeted bisexual Republican representative from Connecticut. Frank told The Washington Post that after McKinney's death there was, [...] "An unfortunate debate about 'Was he or wasn't he? Didn't he or did he?' I said to myself, I don't want that to happen to me." ...|$|E
