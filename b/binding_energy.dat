5|$|After hydrogen, helium is {{the second}} lightest and second most {{abundant}} element in the observable universe, being present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, {{which is more than}} 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this figure in the Sun and in Jupiter. This is due to the very high nuclear <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> (per nucleon) of helium-4 with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. Most helium in the universe is helium-4, the vast majority of which was formed during the Big Bang. Large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a further}} tiny energy gain could be {{extracted}} by synthesizing 62Ni, {{which has a}} marginally higher <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> than 56Fe, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process. Element production in supernovas and distribution on Earth greatly favor iron over nickel, and in any case, 56Fe still has a lower mass per nucleon than 62Ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons. Hence, elements heavier than iron require a supernova for their formation, involving rapid neutron capture by starting 56Fe nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Electrons can {{transfer}} between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy {{that matches the}} difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect. To escape the atom, {{the energy of the}} electron must be increased above its <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> to the atom. This occurs, for example, with the photoelectric effect, where an incident photon exceeding the atom's ionization energy is absorbed by the electron.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> are {{reported}} for all first-row and selected second-row {{transition metal ions}} (M+) bound to benzene. The calculations employ basis sets of at least double-zeta plus polarization quality and account for electron correlation using the modified coupled-pair functional method. While the bending is predominantly electrostatic, the <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> are significantly increased by electron correlation, because the donation from the metal d orbitals to the benzene pi* orbitals is not well described at the self-consistent-field level.

40|$|The mass of {{a highly}} charged ion {{is the sum of}} the mass of the nucleus, the mass of the {{electrons}} and the electronic <b>binding</b> <b>energies.</b> High-accuracy mass measurements on highly charged ions in a sequence of different charge states yield informations on atomic <b>binding</b> <b>energies,</b> i. e., the ionisation potentials. In our contribution we discuss the possibility of determining atomic <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> of highly charged ions to better than 20 eV via cyclotron frequency measurements in a Penning trap. At this level of accuracy different contributions to the <b>binding</b> <b>energies,</b> like relativistic corrections, Breit corrections and QED corrections, can be measured...|$|R
5|$|Neutrons have no {{electrical}} charge {{and have a}} free mass of 1,839 times {{the mass of the}} electron, or , the heaviest of the three constituent particles, but it can be reduced by the nuclear <b>binding</b> <b>energy.</b> Neutrons and protons (collectively known as nucleons) have comparable dimensions—on the order of —although the 'surface' of these particles is not sharply defined.

5|$|Noddack was proven {{right after}} all. Fermi had {{dismissed}} {{the possibility of}} fission {{on the basis of}} his calculations, but he had not taken into account the <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> that would appear when a nuclide with an odd number of neutrons absorbed an extra neutron. For Fermi, the news came as a profound embarrassment, as the transuranic elements that he had partly been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering had not been transuranic elements at all, but fission products. He added a footnote to this effect to his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.|$|E
5|$|The {{equivalence}} between {{mass and}} energy, as {{expressed by the}} formula E=mc, is the most famous consequence of special relativity. In relativity, mass and energy are two different ways of describing one physical quantity. If a physical system has energy, {{it also has the}} corresponding mass, and vice versa. In particular, all properties of a body that are associated with energy, such as its temperature or the <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> of systems such as nuclei or molecules, contribute to that body's mass, and hence act as sources of gravity.|$|E
40|$|We report {{improved}} {{results of}} lowest-lying silicon clusters Si 31 –Si 38. A {{large population of}} low-energy clusters are collected from previous searches by several research groups and the <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> of these clusters are computed using density-functional theory (DFT) methods. Best candidates (isomers with high <b>binding</b> <b>energies)</b> are identified from the screening calculations. Additional constrained search is then performed for the best candidates using the basin-hopping method combined with DFT geometry optimization. The obtained low-lying clusters are classified according to <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> computed using either the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional or the Becke exchange and Lee–Yang–Parr correlation (BLYP) functional. We propose to rank low-lying clusters according to the mean PBE/BLYP <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> in view that the PBE functional tends to give greater <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> for more compact clusters whereas the BLYP functional tends to give greater <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> for less compact clusters or clusters composed of small-sized magic-number clusters.

40|$|Computing <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> of protein-ligand {{complexes}} {{including their}} enthalpy and entropy terms {{by means of}} computational methods is an appealing approach for selecting initial hits and for further optimization in early stages of drug discovery. Despite the importance, computational predictions of thermodynamic components have evaded attention and reasonable solutions. In this study, support vector machines are used for developing scoring functions to compute <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> and their enthalpy and entropy components of protein-ligand complexes. The <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> computed from our newly derived scoring functions have better Pearson's correlation coefficients with experimental data than previously reported scoring functions in benchmarks for protein-ligand complexes from the PDBBind database. The protein-ligand complexes with <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> dominated by enthalpy or entropy term could be qualitatively classified by the newly derived scoring functions with high accuracy. Furthermore, {{it is found that}} the inclusion of comprehensive descriptors based on ligand properties in the scoring functions improved the accuracy of classification as well as the prediction of <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> including their thermodynamic components. The prediction of <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> including the enthalpy and entropy components using the support vector machine based scoring functions should be of value in the drug discovery process...|$|R
5|$|The factor {{limiting}} {{this process}} {{is the amount of}} energy that is released through fusion, which is dependent on the <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> that holds together these atomic nuclei. Each additional step produces progressively heavier nuclei, which release progressively less energy when fusing. In addition, from carbon-burning onwards, energy loss via neutrino production becomes significant, leading to a higher rate of reaction than would otherwise take place. This continues until nickel-56 is produced, which decays radioactively into cobalt-56 and then iron-56 {{over the course of a}} few months. As iron and nickel have the highest <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> per nucleon of all the elements, energy cannot be produced at the core by fusion, and a nickel-iron core grows. This core is under huge gravitational pressure. As there is no fusion to further raise the star's temperature to support it against collapse, it is supported only by degeneracy pressure of electrons. In this state, matter is so dense that further compaction would require electrons to occupy the same energy states. However, this is forbidden for identical fermion particles, such as the electron – a phenomenon called the Pauli exclusion principle.|$|E
5|$|The weak {{interaction}} affects all the fermions of the Standard Model, {{as well as}} the Higgs boson; neutrinos interact through gravity and the {{weak interaction}} only, and neutrinos were the original reason for the name weak force. The weak interaction does not produce bound states (nor does it involve <b>binding</b> <b>energy)</b> – something that gravity does on an astronomical scale, that the electromagnetic force does at the atomic level, and that the strong nuclear force does inside nuclei.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mass}} of the nucleus {{following}} a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a gamma ray, or the kinetic energy of a beta particle), as described by Albert Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula, E=mc2, where m is the mass loss and c is the speed of light. This deficit is part of the <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.|$|E

The bases were chosen for their relevance in heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta polymerization of propene. Comparison of the theoretical data with the calorimetric data indicates that calculations consistently underestimate the experimental <b>binding</b> <b>energies.</b> In light of this consistency, we propose that an empirical correction term added to the theoretical <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> could represent an empirical solution for the prediction of the TiCl 4 /donor <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> with reasonable accuracy...|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{ab initio}} investigation {{has been carried}} out to determine the structures, <b>binding</b> <b>energies,</b> and spin-spin coupling constants of ternary complexes X:CNH:Z and corresponding binary complexes X:CNH and CNH:Z, for X, Z = CNH, FH, ClH, FCl, and HLi. The enhanced <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> of ternary complexes X:CNH:Z for fixed X as a function of Z decrease in the same order as the <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> of the binary complexes CNH:Z. In contrast, the enhanced <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> of the ternary complexes for fixed Z as a function of X do not decrease in the same order as the <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> of the binary complexes X:CNH, a consequence of the increased stabilities of ternary complexes FCl:CNH:Z due to very strong chlorine-shared halogen bonds. For complexes in which the X⋯CNH interaction is a D-H⋯C hydrogen bond for D-H the proton-donor group (N-H, F-H, or Cl-H), spin-spin coupling constants 1 J(D-H) and 2 hJ(D-C) in ternary complexes X:CNH:Z decrease in absolute value as the <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> of binary complexes CNH:Z and the enhanced <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> of the ternary complexes for fixed X as a function of Z also decrease. However, 2 XJ(F-C) increases as the enhanced <b>binding</b> <b>energies</b> of the ternary complexes FCl:CNH:Z decrease, a consequence {{of the nature of the}} chlorine-shared halogen bond. The one-bond coupling constants 1 J(N-H) for the CNH⋯Z interaction in ternary complexes vary significantly, depending on the nature of the X⋯CNH interaction. The largest values of 1 J(N-H) are found for ternary complexes with FCl as X. Two-bond coupling constants 2 hJ(N-A) for A the proton-acceptor atom of Z, and 2 dJ(N-H) decrease in absolute value in the order of decreasing enhancement energies of ternary complexes X:CNH:Z for fixed Z as a function of X. © the Owner Societies 2011.

5|$|The {{amount of}} energy needed to remove or add an {{electron}}—the electron binding energy—is {{far less than the}} <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> of nucleons. For example, it requires only 13.6eV to strip a ground-state electron from a hydrogen atom, compared to 2.23million eV for splitting a deuterium nucleus. Atoms are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism, atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals.|$|E
5|$|The {{fusion of}} two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an {{exothermic}} process that releases {{more energy than}} is required to bring them together. It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and atomic masses higher than about 60, is an endothermic process. These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star.|$|E
5|$|The {{relativistic}} Dirac equation {{has problems}} for elements {{with more than}} 137 protons. For such elements, the wave function of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory rather than bound, {{and there is no}} gap between the positive and negative energy spectra, as in the Klein paradox. More accurate calculations taking into account the effects of the finite size of the nucleus indicate that the <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> first exceeds the limit for elements with more than 173 protons. For heavier elements, if the innermost orbital (1s) is not filled, the electric field of the nucleus will pull an electron out of the vacuum, resulting in the spontaneous emission of a positron; however, this does not happen if the innermost orbital is filled, so that element 173 is not necessarily the end of the periodic table.|$|E

Where the temperature {{is much higher than}} ionization potential, the matter exists in the form of plasma—a gas of positively charged ions (possibly, bare nuclei) and electrons. When the temperature drops below the ionization potential, atoms become statistically favorable.

5|$|Uranium-235 was {{the first}} isotope that {{was found to be}} fissile. Other {{naturally}} occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller nuclei, releasing nuclear <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison, absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods (see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control).|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the great}} rarity of odd–odd nuclei, almost all the {{primordial}} isotopes of the alkali metals are odd–even (the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium-6 and the long-lived radioisotope potassium-40). For a given odd mass number, there can be only a single beta-stable nuclide, since {{there is not a}} difference in <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> between even–odd and odd–even comparable to that between even–even and odd–odd, leaving other nuclides of the same mass number (isobars) free to beta decay toward the lowest-mass nuclide. An effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered elements. Of the 26 monoisotopic elements that have only a single stable isotope, all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons. Beryllium is the single exception to both rules, due to its low atomic number.|$|E

Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> per nucleon (compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table, helium and beryllium); lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than deuterium and helium-3. As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements. Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178ms.

5|$|Two {{terms are}} used in {{referring}} to a quark's mass: current quark mass refers to the mass of a quark by itself, while constituent quark mass refers to the current quark mass plus {{the mass of the}} gluon particle field surrounding the quark. These masses typically have very different values. Most of a hadron's mass comes from the gluons that bind the constituent quarks together, rather than from the quarks themselves. While gluons are inherently massless, they possess energy – more specifically, quantum chromodynamics <b>binding</b> <b>energy</b> (QCBE) – and it is this that contributes so greatly to the overall mass of the hadron (see mass in special relativity). For example, a proton has a mass of approximately 938MeV/c2, of which the rest mass of its three valence quarks only contributes about 9MeV/c2; much of the remainder {{can be attributed to the}} field energy of the gluons.
