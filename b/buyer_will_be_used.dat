No legal system today questions this {{right of the}} buyer, but neither are the same legal remedies available to him everywhere, nor are {{the conditions under which}} they can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> the same. Substantial differences on this issue are noted between continental laws and common laws, but even the legal systems belonging to the same group do not have identical rules about them. That, to a significant extent, may be {{explained by the fact that}} the development path of the seller's responsibility for material defects in comparative law was not the same and for that reason an overview of that issue is given at the beginning of this paper. This is followed by the author's analysis of the buyer's notification on the defects of the goods as a condition for the seller's liability for material defects, and then the differences between systems of legal remedies of the buyer in continental and common laws are given, as well as solutions in several characteristic national laws within each group of laws. Rules of the Vienna Convention on contracts for the international sale of goods are exposed as a separate issue, keeping in mind their importance which is, above all, reflected in their impact on changes in national legislation in this area of law. In the conclusion it is noted that these changes flow toward the harmonization of the laws of the sale of goods, which facilitates trade and promotes economic prosperity...|$|R
30|$|In {{the absence}} of these three {{seasonal}} factors - the high consumption season of sereb, Ramadhan and the 'īd holidays - the normal means for the distribution of livestock for sale in its dominant manifestation on the island is the lone pastoralist either riding a taxi minivan from the rural areas carrying an animal or two, or trekking along steep mountain paths {{with one or two}} goats trailing him, and perhaps with his donkey on his way to Hadiboh to sell them. At destination, the pastoralist becomes an ambulant salesman going door to door to the local restaurants, or loiters around the butcher stall until he finds a <b>buyer.</b> The proceeds <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to purchase the standard items (see list below) needed for a month or so, which either the donkey or public transport will take back to his village for a specific fee per item. Regarding the other auxiliary activities in the pastoral economy, date farming is exclusively for household consumption, and the harvest is unpredictable and usually insufficient for the year, and therefore, locally produced dates are not sold. In sum, the marketing of products from the pastoral economy is constrained by the subsistence motivation of the pastoralists and the local population's limited disposable income. Moreover, the limited supply of locally produced goods available for distribution is mirrored in the frugality of the consumption pattern of Soqotrans, both in the urban and rural areas, but especially in the latter, which is discussed in the next section.|$|R

Most studies are based on somewhat unrealistic assumptions such as deterministic demand and unpermitted shortages.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{behavior}} of experimental markets in which product quality is endogenously determined and cannot be observed by buyers prior to purchase. Several theories suggest that with asymmetric information about product quality between buyers and sellers and the absence of properly defined rules of liability, markets cannot be expected to generate products of "optimal grade. " According to such theories markets <b>will</b> <b>be</b> informationally inefficient. Information that exists <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> properly <b>used</b> because the wrong people have it. As a result, products that can be cheaply produced but are of undesirable quality ("lemons") will drive good grade products from the market because <b>buyers</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> improperly informed at the time of purchase. However, very little noncontroversial evidence exists regarding the proposition. Several modes of behavior and institutions can theoretically intervene to mitigate the problems. In addition, theories are hard to test because measurements of preferences, cost, knowledge, and so forth, of sufficient precision to determine whether a market has "failed" are difficult in naturally occurring environments.
