500|$|At a coroner's inquest, several {{witnesses}} had {{testified that}} they saw Shay shoot Euell after an argument over a sugar bowl. Anderson said {{that she did not}} see much after the initial verbal exchange because she fled the dining area as soon as the argument escalated. At trial, Anderson said that Shay had two drinks at the cafe. She said that Euell had <b>been</b> <b>staring</b> at her, was rude to them and lunged toward Shay before the shooting. The cafe's manager said that Euell had not been rude to Shay. Two waiters denied that Euell had lunged at Shay. A cashier testified that when Shay asked for sugar, Euell pointed out that there was already some on his table, but he brought two more bowls. She said that Shay called Euell [...] "smarty" [...] and confronted Euell with the gun while the waiter was walking away. Shay denied being drunk and said that Euell hit him and threatened to kill him before the shooting.|$|E
