5|$|Pushing {{against an}} object that rests on a {{frictional}} surface {{can result in a}} situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force exactly <b>balances</b> <b>the</b> applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.|$|E
5|$|The area east of Michigan Avenue {{and north}} of the Chicago River had a split {{personality}} {{for much of the}} 20th century - the northern portion upscale residential, retail, and university uses and the area near the Chicago River and Navy Pier dedicated to shipping and factories. At the end of the 1960s, however, residential complexes such as Lake Point Tower(1965) and McClurg Court Center (1971) began to appear among the warehouses {{and by the end of}} the century, residential and retail dominated the entire area. The neighborhood now has a reputation as part of an upscale residential strip that <b>balances</b> <b>the</b> more industrial western portion of the Near North Side.|$|E
5|$|While {{remaining}} upright may be {{the primary}} goal of beginning riders, a bike must lean in order to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the speed or smaller the turn radius, the more lean is required. This <b>balances</b> <b>the</b> roll torque about the wheel contact patches generated by centrifugal force due to the turn with that of the gravitational force. This lean is usually produced by a momentary steering in the opposite direction, called countersteering. Countersteering skill is usually acquired by motor learning and executed via procedural memory rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary control input on bikes is steering torque, not position.|$|E
