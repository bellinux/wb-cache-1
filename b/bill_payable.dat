60|$|Having now {{formed a}} general {{idea of the}} modes in which credit is made {{available}} {{as a substitute for}} money, we have to consider in what manner the use of these substitutes affects the value of money, or, what is equivalent, the prices of commodities. It is hardly necessary to say that the permanent value of money—the natural and average prices of commodities—are not in question here. These are determined by the cost of producing or of obtaining the precious metals.

40|$|Working {{capital is}} the life blood and nerve center of business. Working capital is very {{essential}} to maintain smooth running of a business. No business can run successfully without an adequate amount of working capital. Liquidity functions of a firm {{are related to the}} working capital management. Working capital management is concerned with the problems that arise in attempting to manage the current assets, the current liabilities and the interrelationship, that exists between them. The term current assets refer to those assets which in the ordinary course of business can be, or will be, converted into cash within one year without undergoing a elimination in value and without disrupting the operations of the firm. The major current assets are cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable and inventory. Current liabilities are those liabilities which are intended, at their inception, to be paid in the ordinary course of business, within a year, out of the current assets or earning of the concern. The basic current liabilities are accounts <b>payable,</b> <b>bills</b> <b>payable,</b> bank overdraft and outstanding expenses.

50|$|The {{climax of}} his {{elevation}} occurred in June 1737 when, on {{the extinction of}} the line of Kettler, the nobility ('estates') of Courland were arm-twisted into electing Biron as their reigning duke. Anna had been the wife of the penultimate duke, whose successor, his uncle Ferdinand, died childless in that year. The Kettler dynasty being now extinct, the estates were called upon to elect a new duke, and Anna proposed Biron. He was almost as unpopular in Courland as in Russia, and the estates were mortified at the prospect of this upstart holding sway over them, but the will of the empress could not be easily gainsaid. Still, it was found necessary to supply large sums of money, smuggled into Courland in the shape of <b>bills</b> <b>payable</b> in Amsterdam to bearer, in order to persuade the electors to fall in with Anna's choice. There was another complication: the duchy of Courland was then in dispute between Poland and Russia. Russian armies were employed to place Augustus III, Elector of Saxony, on the Polish throne. In return, the Elector promised that Biron would be invested with the duchy of Courland. The Emperor Charles VI, subordinating everything to his Pragmatic Sanction, readily countenanced these violent acts, and the king of Prussia was bought by certain territorial concessions.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} two questionnaires presented to small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) by RIETI in February 2008 and February 2009. Given the limited data on SMEs, {{the purpose of the}} questionnaires is to understand the current status of financing for SMEs facing this serious economic recession, triggered by the financial crisis. The Survey on the Status of Transactions between Businesses and Financial Institutions conducted in February 2008, was sent to 17, 018 companies nationwide, with SMEs being the main target, and of those recipients 6, 124 companies or 36. 0 % responded. This survey, which was designed to explain the structural characteristics of SME financing, illustrated terms and conditions such as accounts <b>payable</b> and <b>bills</b> <b>payable</b> for inter-firm credit, differences in the roles of major lending financial institutions including main banks, and the impact of changes in the credit guarantee system in recent years.

The survey was conducted to understand how the relationships between companies and financial institutions and customers and suppliers changed, and what measures SMEs took to address these changes, {{in light of the fact}} that the cash management of SMEs has been extremely difficult since last autumn, when the global credit crunch set in.

5|$|From 1779 to 1821 two British fur trading companies, the Montreal-based North West Company (NWC) and the London-based Hudson's Bay Company, {{competed for}} control of the fur trade of what later became Western Canada. The struggle, which {{eventually}} reached the point of armed battles such as the 1816 Battle of Seven Oaks, was mostly over control of Rupert's Land, east of the Continental Divide. Around the turn of the 19th century the NWC expanded its operations westward, across the Rocky Mountains into the mostly unexplored Pacific Northwest. By the 1810s the NWC had established new fur trading operations west of the Rockies, in New Caledonia and the Columbia District. Starting in 1811 the American Pacific Fur Company (PFC) challenged the NWC in the Pacific Northwest, but during the War of 1812 the PFC, at risk of being captured by the British Navy, sold its entire operation to the NWC. The PFC had built Fort Astoria {{at the mouth of the}} Columbia River. Under the NWC it was renamed Fort George, and became the Columbia District's Pacific seaport. The NWC sought to establish a profitable beaver fur trade with China. Due to the East India Company's (EIC) control over British trading in Canton the NWC turned to American shipping companies. Starting in 1792 the NWC had beaver furs shipped to China by American firms. After the acquisition of Fort George (Astoria) in 1815 the NWC began to supply the Columbia District by sea through the Boston-based firm of Perkins and Company. After arriving at Fort George the American ship took a cargo of NWC beaver furs to Canton, exchanged them for China goods and conveyed them to Boston for sale. Even though Perkins and Company took 25% of the proceeds the arrangement was still about 50% more profitable than using British ships and selling furs in Canton through the EIC for <b>bills</b> <b>payable</b> on London and returning from China with no cargo.|$|R

40|$|Inspired by Gerschenkron's thesis, {{this paper}} contends that {{conditions}} of institutional 'backwardness' in late-medieval England stimulated legal innovations {{to provide the}} foundations for negotiability in international financial instruments. Though late-medieval England was not 'backward' in the senses expounded by so many earlier historians, her financial institutions, in comparison with those found on the continent, were far less developed. More retrograde were English fiscal and monetary policies, which {{played a major role}} in the fall of England's wool trade, once her most lucrative source of revenue, and thus indirectly in the expansion of her cloth export trade, which came to be canalized on the Antwerp market, where the major financial innovations did take place. Medieval English bullionist legislation was particularly regressive, by contemporary standards, in attempting to prevent the use of credit in foreign trade, in order to force exporters to repatriate receipts in bullio n even if such policies had a seemingly noble purpose: to protect the integrity of the coinage, while eschewing continental practices of debasement. In their application, however, they not only hindered the use of credit but also prevented the development of deposit banking, with domestic transfer instruments, on the continental model. English Common Law, furthermore, was generally hostile to any developments that would make bonds, especially registered recognizances, fully transferable and negotiable. But, from the late thirteenth century, the crown proved to be progressive in permitting mercantile courts to utilize the practices of an international lex mercatoria. From the 1360 s, English merchants in the wool and cloth trades sought to reduce their transaction costs, to avoid costly recognizances and litigation in Common Law courts, by resorting to informal holograph <b>bills</b> <b>payable</b> to bearer. But these lacked legal protection in transfer payments, until 1436, when the London Mayor's law-merchant court specifically awarded the bearer of a dishonoured bill-of-exchange rights equal to those of the designated payee: the first recorded in Europe, serving as the vital precedent for a similar Antwerp court ruling in 1506 and for national Habsburg legislation in the 1530 s to establish full negotiability of commercial bills, including discounting, with revocation of the usury laws. ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} need to curtail the carbon {{emissions}} in the globe {{in order to achieve}} the climate stabilisation goals based on the climate change threat. And as such, different initiatives and schemes of Government have targeted a number of policies at reducing energy and carbon emissions targets with the housing sector of the economy not an exception. In order to explore the feasibility of achieving carbon emissions reduction targets within the housing sector of the UK, the research views the issue of household energy consumption and carbon emissions as complex sociotechnical problem involving the analysis of both the social and technical variables. This thesis therefore describes the development of the system dynamics based model to capture and solve the problem relating to the future profiles of household energy consumption and carbon emissions by providing a policy advice tool for use by the policy makers. In order to investigate the problem, the research adopts the pragmatist research strategy involving collection of both qualitative and quantitative data to develop the model. The developed model has six modules, which are: population/household, dwelling internal heat, occupants’ thermal comfort, climatic-economic-energy efficiency interaction, household energy consumption, and household CO 2 emissions. In addition to the ‘baseline’ scenario, the developed model was used to develop four illustrative scenarios of household energy consumption and carbon emissions; which are: ‘efficiency’ scenario, ‘behavioural change’ scenario, ‘economic’ scenario, and ‘integrated’ scenario. The ‘efficiency’ scenario generally considers the effects of improvements in energy efficiency measures on household energy consumption and ultimately on household carbon emissions. Additionally, the ‘behavioural change’ scenario tries to model the effects of occupants’ change of energy consumption behaviour on household energy consumption and carbon emissions profile. The ‘economic’ scenario assumes a case of policy change by Government favouring energy prices reduction, thereby reducing the energy <b>bills</b> <b>payable</b> by the householders and its consequences on household energy consumption and carbon emissions. And the ‘integrated’ scenario combines the assumptions in the first three scenarios and then analyses its effects on household energy consumption and carbon emissions.

40|$|Using the {{extensive}} microdata of the Credit Risk Database (CRD), established in 2001 by the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), {{in this paper}} we analyze the determinants for the life duration until legal bankruptcy of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) that have continually been saddled with excess liabilities and suffered recurring losses. We focus in particular on the debt structure of SMEs, clarifying the impact of the ratios and trends of trade credit and bank financing on the timing of legal bankruptcy. The results of this paper's analysis are set out below. First, the ratio of trade payables to total liabilities increases the probability of financially distressed SMEs' falling into legal bankruptcy. There is also a tendency for the ratio of trade credit to decline substantially several years prior to legal bankruptcy. In addition, the larger the degree of decline in trade credit, the shorter is the survival duration of a firm from the time of suffering financial distress to the time of legal bankruptcy. However, the ratio or trend of bank financing does not affect the survival duration. These findings conform to the following characteristics of trade credit. First, trade credit in the form of unsecured claims gives rise to a greater loss if the debtor firm goes bankrupt, and therefore suppliers granting such credit have the incentive to acquire advance corporate credit information more rapidly than banks that are secured creditors. Second, since suppliers have networks with other enterprises, it is possible to obtain credit information on debtor SMEs at a lower cost and more quickly than banks. Third, generally a firm does business with a large number of other suppliers and it is difficult for suppliers to conduct private negotiations among them on such matters as balance maintenance and debt forgiveness. In addition to debt structure, the better a company's corporate fundamentals, for example total asset turnover and ordinary income ratio, the longer will be the duration of its life. Profitability has a stronger effect on medium-sized enterprises than on smaller firms. In addition, SMEs with high fixed-asset ratios and substantial liquidity in hand have a high survival probability and their survival duration is long. On the other hand, SMEs that are relatively large in scale, those with high ratios of interest-bearing liabilities and those with a high proportion of trade credit accounted for by <b>bills</b> <b>payable</b> have low survival probability and a short survival duration. Finally, the paper confirms that financially distressed SMEs that have been relieved by the government support measures for reviving SMEs, such as credit guarantees and the special credit guarantee program for small businesses, have a high probability of survival in the short term, and have long life duration. ...|$|R

In 1861, the consignees offered a premium of 10s per ton to the first ship to dock in London. This was won by the Fiery Cross, who also went on to win in 1862, 1863 and 1865.|$|R
