40|$|This paper reviews {{response}} trends over 24 consecutive {{quarters of}} a National Random Digit Dial telephone survey. Trends for response rates and refusal rates are studied {{as well as the}} components of response rate, namely, contact, cooperation and completion rates. In addition other rates, including answering machine, busy and no answer are studied. While refusal rates declined over the six year period, contact and cooperation rates significantly declined causing response rates to decline. Answering machine rates and busy rates also showed a significant increase over time. Finally, correlation’s among the variables of interest are presented. The response rate is negatively correlated with the <b>busy</b> <b>rate,</b> the answering machine rate and the no answer rate. Implications of the above trends are discussed. ...|$|E

This paper introduces a correlator-based energy sensing strategy for opportunistic spectrum access in a slow, flat-fading channel. The correlator provides weighted energy accumulation in time. We assume that the noise variance is known and the primary user (PU) traffic follows a two state Markov chain with known idle and <b>busy</b> <b>rates.</b> Using Chebyshev bounds on missed detection and false alarm probabilities, we find that the optimal weighting function is an increasing function of time and its shape is dependent on the PU traffic characteristics and SNR. We show that the traditional flat-integration based energy collection method is suboptimal both in the error probability and channel utilization sense.

40|$|Abstract — The study {{proposed}} a dynamic simulation {{model with a}} proposed fuzzy inference-based optimization mechanism to develop an artificial intelligence-based simulation system for multi-objective optimization and to search the optimal resource allocation strategy under dual goals of time/cost tradeoff for the Movable Scaffolding System (MSS). The study analyzes the MSS model with the proposed optimization system to verify the accuracy and applicability of the proposed system via a case study. Through the human thinking model decision making module, the optimized decision basis can be quickly searched to further meet actual conditions and to enhance academic value and application of resource combinations optimization. The most suitable resource combination after applying the proposed optimization module with fuzzy inference mechanism obtains solutions for the actual situation. After model test, the optimized resource combinations using the proposed optimization module can enhance the <b>busy</b> <b>rates</b> of each resource and improve the overstock status of the material during simulation to achieve the objectives of reduced cost, efficient work schedules and enhanced productivity...|$|R

We discuss computation of overlapping regions in more details while describing Algorithm 4. Initially, we assume Poisson distribution for <b>busy</b> period activation <b>rate</b> λ(i) and exponential distribution for average durations T_ON of busy activity, but later, both these quantities are iteratively recomputed {{until they are}} converged. Algorithm 2 then computes the activation rate λ(U [...]...|$|R

Besides, this sensitivity factor remains so determining for the blocking probability theory in a sub-zone C_i by means of the <b>busy</b> bandwidth <b>rate</b> or the offered load traffic rate. The satisfactory results obtained on the system performances of wireless and mobile networks such the LTE and the Wi-Fi based on the bit rate allowed us to discover the dynamic fluctuations system. The parameters related to the bit rate such as the blocking probability are estimated with lower rates the bar 40 [...]...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{proposes that}} a baggage {{handling}} system (BHS) environment can be defined and coupled to a whole life cycle cost (WLCC NPV) model. The results from specific experiments using the model {{can be used as}} the basis by which to commercially compare BHS flight build types of any capacity, and BHS geographical location. The model examined the three flight build types(i) : Fully automatic build 2; (ii) Semi-automatic build, and(iii); Manual build. The model has the ability to calculate a bag flow <b>busy</b> hour <b>rate,</b> and to replicate the baggage flow characteristics observed within real BHS operations. Whole life cycle costs (WLCC NPV) results are produced, and these form the basis by which the comparison of BHS types is made. An overall WLCC NPV scatter diagram was produced, which is a summation of each of the test sensitivities. The assumptions and limitations of the analysis are provided. It is proposed that the results, conclusions and recommendations shall be of value to airports, airlines, and design consultants...|$|R

By the statistical analysis of the large number of traffic data, find out the relationship between the CCFC and the <b>busy</b> traffic congestion <b>rate,</b> and then obtain the best carrier frequency configuration number in each traffic interval. According to the best carrier frequency configuration number, the best cell wireless utilization rate is obtained. This standard reflects the demand number of cell actual carrier frequency configuration, which provides a theoretical basis for the CCFC and the current network cell wireless utilization in the future...|$|R

In traditional single-channel access mechanism, every Internet protocol (IP) has only one channel to access the on-chip network. When the network is relatively idle, the injection rate {{is too small to}} make good use of the network resource. When the network is relatively <b>busy,</b> the ejection <b>rate</b> is so small that the packets in the network cannot leave immediately, and thus the probability of congestion is increased. In the dual-channel access mechanism, the injection rate of IP and the ejection rate of the network are increased by using two optional channels in network interface (NI) and local port of routers. Therefore, the communication performance is improved. Experimental results show that compared with traditional single-channel access mechanism, the proposed scheme greatly increases the throughput and cuts down the average latency with reasonable area increase...|$|R
60|$|These conversations, however, were mere {{episodes of}} the great {{business}} of the passage. Throughout the morning, the master was <b>busy</b> in <b>rating</b> his mates, giving sharp reprimands to the stewards and cooks, overhauling the log line, introducing the passengers, seeing to the stowage of the anchors, in getting down the signal-pole, throwing in touches of Vattel, and otherwise superintending duty, and dispensing opinions. All this time, the cat in the grass does not watch the bird that hops along the ground with keener vigilance than he kept {{his eye on the}} Foam. To an ordinary observer, the two ships presented the familiar spectacle of vessels sailing in the same direction, with a very equal rate of speed; and as the course was that necessary to clear the Channel, most of the passengers, and, indeed, the greater part of the crew, began to think the cruiser, like themselves, was merely bound to the westward. Mr. Truck, on the contrary, judging by signs and movements that more naturally suggested themselves to one accustomed to direct the evolutions of a ship, and to reason on their objects, than to the mere subjects of his will, thought differently. To him, the motive of the smallest change on board the sloop-of-war was as intelligible {{as if it had been}} explained in words, and he even foresaw many that were about to take place. Before noon, the Foam had got fairly abeam, and Mr. Leach, pointing out the circumstance, observed, that if her wish was to overhaul them, she ought then to tack; it being a rule among seamen, that the pursuing vessel should turn to windward as often as she found herself nearest to her chase. But the experience of Captain Truck taught him better; the tide was setting into the Channel on the flood, and the wind enabled both ships to fake the current on their lee-bows, a power that forced them up to windward; whereas, by tacking, the Foam would receive the force of the stream on her weather broadside, or so nearly so, as to sweep her farther astern than her difference in speed could easily repair.|$|R
