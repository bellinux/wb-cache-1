5|$|Like {{the games}} before it, Cross Days is {{presented}} with limited animation. The game is audibly stereophonic with lip-synched voice acting, sound effects and <b>background</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>background</b> <b>music</b> {{used for}} the fight scene is a knockoff of the music used in the fight scene in The Quiet Man.|$|E
5|$|This diverse {{range of}} music was only {{featured}} during the first series due to the difficulty in obtaining rights for commercial releases (leading to episodes of the first series being remade as an LP album without the proprietary <b>background</b> <b>music</b> in 1979). For series two Paddy Kingsland was commissioned to provide <b>background</b> <b>music</b> and for the third to fifth series Paul 'Wix' Wickens was chosen.|$|E

5|$|Although Huntsman {{emphasized}} {{his opposition}} to negative campaigning, he did run an ad attacking Ron Paul with Twilight Zone theme as <b>background</b> <b>music,</b> and implying that Paul's views were outside the mainstream.|$|E
5|$|The play {{can also}} be seen as a {{predecessor}} to the exaggerated emotionalism of later American drama, and as an early example of how <b>background</b> <b>music</b> would be used in more modern American drama and films.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{also took}} place in 2005, near the {{marketplace}} of the Bucharest neighborhood Rahova. The chosen area raised a few difficulties related to safety. However, the production benefited from its picturesque view, rendering the scenography and the original music unnecessary. The omnipresent manele also {{found their way into}} the movie, as <b>background</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E
50|$|Flimbo's Quest {{takes place}} over seven levels: a normal rural landscape, a fishing village, a {{mountain}} landscape, a weird alien world, a forest, a graveyard and Fransz Dandruff's laboratory.

5|$|In the 1980s, {{electronic}} {{white noise}} machines became commercially available. These are used alone {{to provide a}} pleasant background noise and to mask unpleasant noise, a similar role to conventional <b>background</b> <b>music.</b> This usage can have health applications {{in the case of}} individuals struggling with over-stimulation or sensory processing disorder. Also, white noise is sometimes used to mask sudden noise in facilities with research animals.|$|E
5|$|McMillen and Glaiel {{created the}} game and {{developed}} it in 14 days. Both developers expressed interest in seeing a version being released on the Wii game console through the WiiWare online service. Aether received a positive response from video game blogs for its unusual visual style and atmosphere. The single looped piece of <b>background</b> <b>music</b> received a mixed response and the controls were highlighted as {{an area of the}} game that could have been improved before release.|$|E
5|$|Piano Collections Kingdom Hearts Field & Battle is {{the second}} {{compilation}} album of compositions from the Kingdom Hearts series arranged for solo piano by Sachiko Miyano and Natsumi Kameoka.

5|$|The dramas feature <b>background</b> <b>music</b> {{composed}} by Takeshi Abo, who previously composed {{the music for}} the Steins;Gate game, and cover art by the game's character designer Huke. The voice cast of the game also reprised their roles, and {{said that it was}} fun to be able to return to their respective characters.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} adapted from a play {{of the same name}} written by K. Balachander, with the play also {{featuring}} Nagesh himself in the title role along with Major Sundarrajan and S. N. Lakshmi who reprised their roles in the film. Balachander also wrote the screenplay and dialogues for the film. Viswanathan–Ramamoorthy composed the film's soundtrack and <b>background</b> <b>music,</b> while Kannadasan and Vaali wrote the lyrics for the soundtrack's songs.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} new wave patterns, <b>backgrounds,</b> <b>music</b> tracks and bosses in SIE2 {{as well as}} a {{commentator}} which you hear when the player achieves certain goals. This male voice also serves to provides words of encouragement and congratulations. However, as in a possible throwback to the last game, the first stage background pattern from Extreme 1 is visible in the background in the menu screens.|$|R
5|$|The film's {{music and}} sound was also {{thoroughly}} post-processed by the project's sound designer, Andrei Toncu, {{to improve the}} quality of the recordings, because the budget did not allow for complex equipment to be used, and for creative interest. The movie's <b>background</b> <b>music</b> has reduced volume, following the emotional evolution of the charactersToncu combining the <b>background</b> <b>music</b> (recorded with, or without intention) and a series of effects characteristic to electronic music and musique concrète. However, a few distinct moments can be observed in the film's music, either composed by Andrei Toncu (Andrei imagining stealing the trolleybus), or already existing recordings, edited so that they would integrate into the movie's atmosphere (Elvis Presley's dedication is dynamically equalized to suggest the shift from one radio to another). Another scene in which multiple layers of sound were used was the radio show heard in Giani's car about the breeding of Memestra brassicae butterflies.|$|E
5|$|After the film's release, several {{blogs and}} users of social media {{websites}} Twitter, Facebook and YouTube accused {{the director of}} plagiarism. Media further alleged that Basu had not tried to credit the original sources. Several videos were uploaded to YouTube showing side-by-side comparisons with Hollywood films like Cops, The Adventurer, City Lights, Singin' in the Rain, Project A, The Notebook and Benny & Joon. They also accused Barfi!s music director Pritam of copying the <b>background</b> <b>music</b> from the French film Amélie.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} for School Days and Summer Days, the {{original}} soundtrack of Cross Days was reproduced for distribution alongside the game, initially scheduled for February 27, 2009. As this {{was the first of the}} later six postponements, however, the album was republished and deferred to June 26. Following the second delay, the soundtrack was held indefinitely until 0verflow announced on April 16, 2010 that it would be released April 21. The album contains all of the game's <b>background</b> <b>music,</b> all of which was composed by HIKO of KIRIKO/HIKO Sound, and theme songs performed by Yozuca*, iyuna, Ceui, Kotaro Odaka and Riryka, totaling 25 tracks.|$|E
50|$|Because of that, Alceu {{was able}} to {{recreate}} Northeastern traditional music, like baião, coco, toada, maracatu, frevo, caboclinhos, embolada and repentes: all sung with a sometimes rock sometimes alternative sounding <b>music</b> <b>background.</b> His <b>music</b> and his themes are intangible, universal and unlimited. However, his aesthetic basis is genuinely Brazilian Northeastern music.|$|R

5|$|Combat in Mother 3 {{includes}} a unique musical combo system {{not seen in}} previous Mother games. When one of the player's characters directly attacks an enemy with a weapon, they can repeatedly attack the enemy by pressing the button {{in time with the}} beat of the <b>background</b> <b>music,</b> with each enemy possessing a musical theme with different rhythms. Using this system, the player can attack the enemy up to sixteen times in a row. When the correct beat is not apparent, the player can put the enemy to sleep to isolate the beat from the music.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Matsueda and Eguchi {{made their}} first major {{collaboration}} by scoring the role-playing racing game Racing Lagoon, with synthesizer programmer Ryo Yamazaki providing three tracks. Matsueda {{was responsible for}} all the music except the battle, opening, and ending themes. They collaborated again on the soundtrack to the PlayStation 2 title The Bouncer in 2000, whereas the two took a more equal share of the music. A large amount of the compositions produced was not used {{in the game and}} there were also many post-production demands. Afterward, Matsueda created 25 pieces of <b>background</b> <b>music</b> for Square's PlayOnline viewer used for Final Fantasy XI and Tetra Master.|$|E
