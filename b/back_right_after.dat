Abbott, despite his legitimate fighting background, had little wrestling experience and had failed to connect with WCW audiences. Bill Busch would later be removed from power and replaced at the helm by Time Warner programming executive Brad Siegel. Kevin Sullivan, who had been an on/off booker {{over the course of several}} years, was placed in charge in the interim. The new writing team attempted to appease the demoralized wrestlers and fans by making Chris Benoit the WCW Champion at Souled Out in January 2000. However, Benoit (who had legitimate bad blood with Sullivan stemming from him having an affair with Sullivan's wife Nancy several years previously) was among a group of wrestlers who expressed their intent to leave the company prior to the show. He handed the belt <b>back</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> winning it and signed with the WWF the next day, along with his similarly frustrated friends Perry Saturn, Eddie Guerrero and Dean Malenko. The four quickly became popular in the WWF as [...] "The Radicalz".|$|E

Hmong New Year lasts only for 3 days—with 10 dishes of food each day, for a total of 30 dishes—thus the Hmong saying “eat 30.” Here are a few practices that the Hmong observe during their New Year Celebration, performed anytime during the 3 days of celebration.|$|E

5000|$|Jón Páll {{was invited}} to the World's Strongest Man {{competition}} {{for the first time}} in 1983, in which he came in second only to Geoff Capes. The following year at the young age of only 24, he managed to defeat Capes and secure the title.

5000|$|Dozens {{of unique}} spells {{can be learned}} from scrolls that use the various {{elements}} of nature (wind, earth, fire, and water). Each character has to learn the spells individually with no spell sharing allowed. Spells are lost when the character that was holding them temporarily disappears from the party along with any armed weapon or armor that he was carrying. The equipment and spells are gained <b>back</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> the character re-joins the group. Symbols determine the effects of the spell. For example, a spell with an up arrow is a spell that increases the target's stats and a spell with a flame symbol on it is considered to be an attack spell (regardless of which element that spell actually belongs to). At the start of the game, a dying woman assigns the player the challenge of [...] "conquering the world." [...] For every enemy encounter that the player overcomes in battle, the warriors gain gold pieces and experience points. The combat system and some of the music used in the game is borrowed from vintage Final Fantasy games such as Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy IV.|$|E

5000|$|Manolito (Manuel Goreiro, Jr., 29 March 1965): The {{son of a}} Spanish shopkeeper. He is {{sometimes}} referred to as gallego (Galician), as his surname hints at such an origin, but it is common practice in Argentina to refer to Spanish migrants as Galicians. While his family business is but a small, local grocery store, he seems ambitious with his career, and is more concerned with notions of business, capitalism and dollars, than anything else. He's always promoting the store and its products in street graffiti and even in ordinary conversations. He's shown to be simple minded, but sometimes appears creative when it comes to business plans. He never goes on a vacation because of his father, who owns the store they work in; both appear to enjoy making money and upon Manolito suggesting closing shop and go on a vacation for a few days, his dad appeared to have fainted from shock. The quality of the products sold is often questionable, as many people have complained to him and/or his father often. Manolito is characterized by his brush-like hair, which runs in the males of the family, and in one strip it is seen as growing quickly <b>back</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> it has been shaved.|$|E
50|$|Williams {{came into}} the Mutua Madrid Open as the {{defending}} champion. Williams began her defense against Yulia Putintseva. Putintseva broke Williams in the opening game; Williams then broke back in the sixth game. The opening set then went to a tie-break, with Williams winning it. In the second set, Williams broke serve four times, while getting broken once herself to win the second set with a breadstick to win the match. In the following round, Williams went against local Lourdes Domínguez Lino. Williams took an early lead in the first set and served {{for it in the}} seventh game just to be broken, but broke back to take the set. In the second set, they went toe-to-toe, where Williams sneaked ahead, breaking in the twelfth game to win the match. In the round of 16, Williams faced 13th seed Maria Kirilenko. Both held serves in the first six games, until Williams raced through, winning nine of the last ten games. Williams made 22 winners and 10 unforced errors to Kirilenko's 9 and 25. Williams lost 2 points on serve, both on the second serve, and made no unforced errors in the second set. In the last 8, Williams took on wild card Anabel Medina Garrigues; the first set went on serve until Williams broke in the eighth game and then served it out. In the second set, Medina Garrigues took advantage of an erratic Williams taking the second set in a bagel. Williams took the first two games of the final set just to see Medina Garrigues take the next four; however, Williams came back and won the set in the twelfth game. Williams made 39 winners to 48 unforced errors to Medina Garrigues' 19 and 18. In the semifinals, Williams faced Sara Errani. Errani broke twice in the third and seventh game just to see Williams break <b>back</b> <b>right</b> <b>after.</b> Williams then broke in a hard fought game in the twelfth game to take the set. Williams then broke Errani in the fourth game and then in the eighth game to advance to the final. Williams made 47 winners to Errani's 8 and 39 unforced errors to Errani's 13. This marks Williams first red clay final since her triumph in the 2002 French Open. Williams faced 2nd-seed Maria Sharapova in the final, where the winner could take the number 1 ranking. Williams dominated the first set, winning the first four games and eventually closing it out in the seventh game. Sharapova then broke Williams in the opening game but Williams broke back in sixth game and then again in the tenth game to take the match. Williams made 18 winners and unforced errors, while Sharapova made 14 winners to 21 unforced errors. This is Williams' 50th career title and her first on the red clay since the 2002 French Open.|$|E

However, 1912 was a watershed year for the US as well, {{with the election of}} progressive Democrat Woodrow Wilson. Locally, Yrigoyen looks like a break, but globally, the rise of Argentina’s radicals looks more like an international leftward trend. The radicals held on to power until 1930, while the US and the UK moved <b>back</b> to the <b>right</b> <b>after</b> World War I.|$|R
