25|$|Brussels, {{the federal}} capital of Belgium, {{is also one}} of the three Regions of Belgium, forming the <b>Brussels</b> <b>Capital</b> <b>Region,</b> and is {{represented}} in the Belgian Federal Parliament by fifteen directly elected members of the Chamber of Representatives and indirectly elected members of the Senate, chosen by the Brussels Regional Parliament. In addition, as the capital of Flanders, Brussels is also represented in the Flemish Parliament. However, its representatives have no voting rights on matters devolved to the Brussels City Region.|$|E
25|$|Geographically, Flanders is {{generally}} flat, {{and has a}} small section of coast on the North Sea. Much of Flanders is agriculturally fertile and densely populated, with a population density of almost 500 people per square kilometer (1,200 per square mile). It touches France to the west near the coast, and borders the Netherlands {{to the north and}} east, and Wallonia to the south. The <b>Brussels</b> <b>Capital</b> <b>Region</b> is an enclave within the Flemish Region. Flanders has exclaves of its own: Voeren in the east is between Wallonia and the Netherlands and Baarle-Hertog in the north consists of 22 exclaves surrounded by the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Besides Saint-Gilles-du-Gard, {{nineteen}} {{other cities}} bear his name. Cities that possess relics of St. Giles include Saint-Gilles, Toulouse and {{a multitude of}} other French cities; Antwerp, Brugge and Tournai in Belgium; Cologne and Bamberg in Germany (known as Egidien); Rome and Bologna in Italy; Prague in the Czech Republic; and Esztergom in Hungary. Giles is also {{the patron saint of}} Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, where St. Giles' Cathedral is a prominent landmark. He is also the patron saint of: Graz, Nuremberg, Osnabrück, Sankt Gilgen, Brunswick, Wollaberg, Saint-Gilles (<b>Brussels</b> <b>Capital</b> <b>Region)</b> and Saint-Gillis-Waas. In 1630, the church of Sant'Egidio in Trastevere in Rome was dedicated to him, and which since 1968 has housed the lay Community of Sant'Egidio.|$|E
40|$|Belgium {{has evolved}} into a federal State. There are three Regions endowed with competences in social and {{economic}} matters: The Flemish Region, the Walloon region and the <b>Region</b> of <b>Brussels</b> – <b>Capital.</b> The <b>Regions</b> have a well-defined territory that is under their jurisdiction. Furthermore, there are three communities: the Flemish Community, the French Community and the German speaking Community. These communities have competences in cultural matters and in n matters of well being and personal development. It {{is important to note that}} the communities have no well defined territory as such, seen the fact that some parts of the country have a bilingual status. These remarks on Belgian federalism are important, while the federal structure has an influence on industrial relations. Labour law and also social security law constitute a competence of the federal authorities. Since the regions are competent to develop an employment policy in their own right, it is easily understood that friction and tensions are possible. In Belgium there are al least three “labour relations systems ” : one for the private sector, one for the public sector and one for the semi-public sector...|$|R
40|$|Aim. e The Belgian medical {{world has}} {{acknowledged}} {{the diagnosis of}} transsexualism and accepted Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS) {{as one of the}} steps in the treatment of choice since 1985. This prevalence and demographic study analyses data on all Belgian individuals who have undergone SRS since that year. Methods. e All (188) plastic surgeons as well as all gender teams (Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent, and Liège) in Belgium were sent demographic questionnaires to be completed for each of their transsexual patients. Results. e The results show an overall prevalence of 1 : 12, 900 for male-to-female and 1 : 33, 800 for female-to-male transsexuals in Belgium. In Wallonia (the French-speaking region of Belgium) the prevalence is significantly lower than in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking region) and in <b>Brussels</b> (the bilingual <b>capital</b> <b>region).</b> In the total Belgian population the male/female sex ratio is 2. 43 : 1, again with a substantial difference between Wallonia {{on the one hand and}} Flanders on the other. Discussion and Conclusion. eWhile in Flanders and in Brussels the prevalence is comparable to that in other Western European countries, in Wallonia it is markedly lower. Transsexualism in Wallonia appears to be socially less acceptable: persons suffering from gender dysphoria in that part of Belgium encounter more problems accessing gender clinics and receiving treatment...|$|R

25|$|At the {{creation}} of the Belgian state, French was the only official language. French was during a long period used as a second language in Flanders and, like elsewhere in Europe, commonly spoken among the aristocracy. There is still a French-speaking minority in Flanders, especially in the municipalities with language facilities, along the language border and the Brussels periphery (Vlaamse Rand), though many of them are French-speakers that migrated to Flanders in recent decades. French is the primary language in the officially bilingual <b>Brussels</b> <b>Capital</b> <b>Region,</b> (see Francization of Brussels). In French Flanders, French is now the native language {{of the majority of the}} population and the only official language. Historically it was a Dutch-speaking region and there is still a minority of Dutch-speakers living there.|$|E
2500|$|... 46% of the {{population}} of Brussels are from outside Belgium; of these, half are from other EU member states. About 3/5 of European Civil Servants live in the <b>Brussels</b> <b>Capital</b> <b>Region</b> with 63% in the communes around the European district (24% in the Flemish region to the north and 11% in the Walloon region to the south). Half of civil servants are home owners. The institutions draw in, directly employed and employed by representatives, 50,000 people to work in the city. A further 20,000 people are working in Brussels due to the presence of the institutions (generating €2billion a year) and 2000 foreign companies drawn into the city employ 80,000 multilingual locals.|$|E
2500|$|The Convention {{recommends}} that certain signs – such as [...] "STOP", [...] "ZONE", etc. – be in English; however, {{use of the}} local language is also permitted. If a language uses non-Latin characters, a Latin-script transliteration {{of the names of}} cities and other important places should also be given. Road signs in the Republic of Ireland are bilingual, using Irish and English. Wales similarly uses bilingual Welsh–English signs, while some parts of Scotland have bilingual Scottish Gaelic–English signs. Finland also uses bilingual signs, in Finnish and Swedish. Signs in Belgium are in French, Dutch, or German depending on the region. In the <b>Brussels</b> <b>Capital</b> <b>Region,</b> road signs are in both French and Dutch. Signs in Switzerland are in French, German, Italian, or Romansh depending on the canton.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, Brussels’ {{population}} is growing and requires {{more and more}} space for housing. This constantly growing process tend to push the industrial and medium / large economic activities out of the city. These activities are wrongly perceived to be unsightly for an urban environment. Economic activities, often mixed with other functions {{play an important role}} within cities and their suburbs areas. However this role is not well understood. For that reason an analysis that identifies the different types of activities and their location can be fundamental in the early phase of a urban development project, to give at all the stakeholders a better and more complete view. This work is based on the will to get a better and new kind of knowledge about the location and differentiation of economic activities in Brussels metropolitan northern area. The visualization of the diversity of types and scales of economic activities, and understanding trends and dynamics, can be considered as a useful set of information to be used in a urban development and economic policy making process. The work, conceived as a pilot project, which could be extended and repeated in other areas, is based on an empirical research, done by a visual check of what is identifiable as economic or designed for an economic use directly on the site, aimed to identify, locate and classify all the different types of existing economic activities in the selected areas. This economic activities inventory is the only one existing for <b>Brussels</b> <b>Capital</b> and Flanders <b>Regions</b> based on field work. In this paper we will explain the method used for the field work and inventarisation, the possible link with existing economic databases and the difficulties encountered during the work. We will also show how this new data is used in ongoing spatial planning processes and to what extend these new insights promote different spatial planning proposals and realisation...|$|R
