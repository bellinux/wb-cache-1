Their role is to generate turbulence in the flow to rapidly mix the air with fuel. Early combustors tended to use <b>bluff</b> <b>body</b> domes (rather than swirlers), which used a simple plate to create wake turbulence to mix the fuel and air. Most modern designs, however, are swirl stabilized (use swirlers). The swirler establishes a local low pressure zone that forces some of the combustion products to recirculate, creating the high turbulence. However, the higher the turbulence, the higher the pressure loss will be for the combustor, so the dome and swirler must be carefully designed so as not to generate more turbulence than is needed to sufficiently mix the fuel and air.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{method of}} flow {{measurement}} involves placing a <b>bluff</b> <b>body</b> (called a shedder bar) {{in the path}} of the fluid. As the fluid passes this bar, disturbances in the flow called vortices are created. The vortices trail behind the cylinder, alternatively from each side of the <b>bluff</b> <b>body.</b> This vortex trail is called the Von Kármán vortex street after von Kármán's 1912 mathematical description of the phenomenon. The frequency at which these vortices alternate sides is essentially proportional to the flow rate of the fluid. Inside, atop, or downstream of the shedder bar is a sensor for measuring the frequency of the vortex shedding. This sensor is often a piezoelectric crystal, which produces a small, but measurable, voltage pulse every time a vortex is created. Since the frequency of such a voltage pulse is also proportional to the fluid velocity, a volumetric flow rate is calculated using the cross sectional area of the flow meter. The frequency is measured and the flow rate is calculated by the flowmeter electronics using the equation where [...] is the frequency of the vortices, [...] the characteristic length of the <b>bluff</b> <b>body,</b> [...] is the velocity of the flow over the <b>bluff</b> <b>body,</b> and [...] is the Strouhal number, which is essentially a constant for a given body shape within its operating limits.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{simulation}} of flow around <b>bluff</b> <b>bodies</b> and bridge deck sections, in which unsteady nature and vortex shedding of flow are commonly found, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Various turbulence models have been tested to develop understanding and proper modelling techniques for the flow around such bodies. Throughout the thesis, the turbulence models employed, mainly large eddy simulation (LES) and detached eddy simulation (DES), have been validated through comparative study with experimental work. The {{major part of the}} work discusses flow around <b>bluff</b> <b>bodies</b> ranging from a simple circular cylinder, a square cylinder to rectangular sections with various aspect ratios (1 : 2 to 1 : 8). The research section concentrates on modelling flow characteristics around <b>bluff</b> <b>bodies</b> to investigate the impact of fluid flow on them. This aids in the understanding of a more complex flow around bridge deck sections. The thesis combines investigation and discussion of the vortex shedding nature on the flow around <b>bluff</b> <b>bodies,</b> in which the simulations are done using advanced modelling techniques on high performance computing system. Work also includes a sectional wind tunnel test of the bridge deck section for the comparative study with the numerical solution.

50|$|One of the {{classical}} open-flow problems in fluid mechanics concerns the flow around a circular cylinder, or more generally, a <b>bluff</b> <b>body.</b> At very low Reynolds numbers (based on {{the diameter of the}} circular member) the streamlines of the resulting flow is perfectly symmetric as expected from potential theory. However, as the Reynolds number is increased the flow becomes asymmetric and the so-called Kármán vortex street occurs. The motion of the cylinder thus generated due to the vortex shedding can be harnessed to generate electrical power.|$|E
50|$|Note, however, that vortex-induced {{vibration}} is a {{far more}} complex process that involves both the external wind-initiated forces and internal self-excited forces that lock on to the motion of the structure. During lock-on, the wind forces drive the structure at or near one of its natural frequencies, but as the amplitude increases this has the effect of changing the local fluid boundary conditions, so that this induces compensating, self-limiting forces, which restrict the motion to relatively benign amplitudes. This is clearly not a linear resonance phenomenon, even if the <b>bluff</b> <b>body</b> has itself linear behaviour, since the exciting force amplitude is a nonlinear force of the structural response.|$|E

50|$|The {{equation}} is easier understood for the idealized situation {{where all of}} the fluid impinges on the reference area and comes to a complete stop, building up stagnation pressure over the whole area.

50|$|For common flows (the ones {{which can}} usually be {{considered}} as incompressible or isothermal), the kinematic viscosity is everywhere uniform over all the flow field and constant in time, {{so there is no}} choice on the viscosity parameter, which becomes naturally the kinematic viscosity of the fluid being considered at the temperature being considered. On the other hand, the reference length is always an arbitrary parameter, so particular attention should be put when comparing flows around different obstacles or in channels of different shapes: the global Reynolds numbers should be referred to the same reference length. This is actually the reason for which most precise sources for airfoil and channel flow data specify the reference length at a pedix to the Reynolds number. The reference length can vary depending on the analysis to be performed: for body with circle sections such as circular cylinders or spheres, one usually chooses the diameter; for an airfoil, a generic non-circular cylinder or a <b>bluff</b> <b>body</b> or a revolution body like a fuselage or a submarine, it is usually the profile chord or the profile thickness, or some other given widths that are in fact stable design inputs; for flow channels usually the hydraulic diameter) about which the fluid is flowing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Because of the {{practical}} importance of <b>bluff</b> <b>bodies</b> subjected fluid flow, fluid dynamics around two-dimensional <b>bluff</b> <b>bodies,</b> especially circular cylinders, has been studied in light of three major parameters, namely flow-induced force, surface pressure and wake.

This paper discusses force and pressure measurement results for two circular cylinders at gap-spacing ratio T/D varied from 0. 1 to 5 and the attack angle α from 0 ° to 180 ° where T is the gap width between the cylinders and D is the diameter of a cylinder.
