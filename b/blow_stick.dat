5000|$|All Fowled Up (1955): The {{scene where}} Foghorn tries to <b>blow</b> a <b>stick</b> of {{dynamite}} through a tube at Dawg, but it backfires.|$|R
6000|$|Just as {{the boys}} came up, another <b>blow</b> from a <b>stick</b> fell on his head; and this served to rouse him to desperation, for he turned round, with one blow knocked down the fellow who had struck him, and then {{commenced}} a furious attack upon his persecutors. For a moment they drew back, and then closed upon him again. <b>Blows</b> from <b>sticks</b> and hands rained upon him, but he struggled desperately. At last, overwhelmed by numbers, he fell; and {{as he did so}} he raised a wild shout, [...] "Hurroo for ould Ireland." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{an instant}} they leaped off, {{and gave a}} couple of sharp <b>blows</b> with their <b>sticks</b> to the horses, who dashed off at a gallop down the road.|$|R
50|$|Over 450 {{people were}} wounded {{and two were}} slain in the violence, while a third was mortally wounded and died in February. According to the Cochabamba Human Rights Commission (Comisión de Derechos Humanos de Cochabamba): at least 400 {{suffered}} <b>blows</b> from <b>sticks,</b> stones, fists, or other objects; 36 more suffered severe wounds from such blows; and 11 were wounded by gunshots.|$|R
60|$|Strangely, Ah Kim made {{no effort}} to run away from his mother, which he could easily have done. She, on the other hand, found fresh cause for more <b>stick</b> <b>blows.</b>|$|R
60|$|Dick rushed {{upon the}} men, and felled {{one with a}} {{sweeping}} <b>blow</b> of his <b>stick.</b> The other man who was standing up sprang at him, knife in hand, with a savage oath.|$|R
60|$|Once fairly {{away from}} the camping-ground, Cuthbert, with <b>blows</b> of his <b>stick,</b> {{increased}} {{the speed of the}} camel to a long shuffling trot, and the fire in the distance soon faded out into the darkness.|$|R
6000|$|CATHERINE [to {{the soldier}}s]. Leave us. Quick! do you hear? Five {{thousand}} <b>blows</b> of the <b>stick</b> for the soldier {{who is in}} the room when I speak next. [The soldiers rush out.] Naryshkin: are you waiting to be knouted? [Naryshkin backs out hastily.] ...|$|R
6000|$|PATIOMKIN [with sudden fury]. Why are {{visitors}} {{of consequence}} announced by a sergeant? [Springing {{at him and}} seizing him by the throat.] What {{do you mean by}} this, you hound? Do you want five thousand <b>blows</b> of the <b>stick?</b> Where is General Volkonsky? ...|$|R
60|$|NARYSHKIN [seizing her and {{clapping}} {{his hand over}} her mouth]. Tie him neck and crop. Ten thousand <b>blows</b> of the <b>stick</b> if you let him go. [Claire twists herself loose: turns on him: and cuffs him furiously.] Yow--ow! Have mercy, Little Mother.|$|R
6000|$|Dick {{explained}} that he had felled one with a <b>blow</b> from the <b>stick,</b> and not having time to strike with it again, had sent the second staggering over the group with a blow of his fist; [...] "those are the two that got away, I expect," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... “The one {{upon the}} head was evidently caused by a fall upon a stone, which would, I think, alone have {{produced}} insensibility,” he said. “The one upon the cheek was apparently {{the result of a}} <b>blow</b> from a <b>stick,</b> but it might have been occasioned by a fall.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is very curious, certainly,' said he; 'but which end {{is it that}} restores {{people to}} life? After all, anyone can be killed by a <b>blow</b> from a <b>stick</b> if it is only hard enough!' But when he was shown the end he threw the stuff over his {{shoulders}} and vanished.|$|R
6000|$|... "You first, Nick." [...] Then came a {{crackling}} and rustling of boughs, a head appeared, {{and at that}} moment Stead loosed Growler and would have dealt a <b>blow</b> with his <b>stick,</b> but that the assault of the dog had sufficed to send the assailant, roaring and cursing, headlong down the crag.|$|R
60|$|Grey Beaver {{continued}} to beat, White Fang {{continued to}} snarl. But {{this could not}} last for ever. One or the other must give over, and that one was White Fang. Fear surged through him again. For {{the first time he}} was being really man-handled. The occasional <b>blows</b> of <b>sticks</b> and stones he had previously experienced were as caresses compared with this. He broke down and began to cry and yelp. For a time each blow brought a yelp from him; but fear passed into terror, until finally his yelps were voiced in unbroken succession, unconnected with the rhythm of the punishment.|$|R
6000|$|Old Mother West Wind {{suddenly}} {{puffed out}} {{her cheeks and}} blew so hard that she <b>blew</b> a big <b>stick</b> {{right out of the}} bottom of the old nest. Down it fell bumpity-bump on the branches of the Great Pine. After it fell--what do you think? Why, hickory nuts and chestnuts and acorns and hazel nuts, such a lot of them! ...|$|R
50|$|The {{fight in}} the stands {{attracted}} the attention of the Jaros, who rushed across the rink to join in. The fight ended only after Bilodeau and others were subdued with mace. Two policemen were treated at hospital with head injuries caused by <b>blows</b> from hockey <b>sticks.</b> Police charged Bilodeau with second-degree assault, as well as misdemeanour charges of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. He was one of seven Jaros charged.|$|R
5000|$|Foghorn's next pranks end up {{backfiring}} on him. When he constructs an eleborate {{pipeline to}} <b>blow</b> a <b>stick</b> of dynamite out of Dawg's kennel {{with the intention}} of blowing him up, while he tries to light a lighter to ignite the dynamite ("this is gonna cause more confusion than a mouse at a burlesque show"), Dawg lights a match from his side and blows it over to Foghorn where it ignites the fuse on the dynamite just as he lights his lighter. The feathers of Foghorn's upper half come out {{from the end of the}} pipe on Dawg's side after the explosion. Foghorn is quick to pick his plumage up, saying [...] "Fortunately, I keep my feathers numbered for... for just such an emergency." ...|$|R
3000|$|In ancient China, {{gambling}} {{was popular}} although stigmatized, and decrees prohibiting {{such and such}} game followed one another relentlessly (Yang, 1990). Under the Qings, the makers of gambling accessories and citizens who accepted them as gifts were liable to expulsion or to 100 <b>blows</b> with a <b>stick</b> (Xu & Luo, 1994). In Maoist China, gambling became synonymous with capitalist evil and speculation, contrary to the ethic of labour and selflessness as prescribed by chikuzaiqian, xianglezaihou ([...] [...]...|$|R
60|$|When {{the last}} echo of their eluded pursuers {{had died in}} the distant uplands, Turnbull began to unpack the {{provisions}} with the easy air of a man at a picnic. He had just laid out the last items, put a bottle of wine on the floor, and a tin of salmon on the window-ledge, when the bottomless silence of that forgotten place was broken. And it was broken by three heavy <b>blows</b> of a <b>stick</b> delivered upon the door.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{through all}} {{the din of the}} dark streets came a crash of glass. With that mysterious suddenness of the Cockney mob, a rush was made in the right direction, a dingy office, next to the shop of the potted meat. The pane of glass was lying in {{splinters}} about the pavement. And the police already had their hands on a very tall young man, with dark, lank hair and dark, dazed eyes, with a grey plaid over his shoulder, who had just smashed the shop window with a single <b>blow</b> of his <b>stick.</b>|$|R
60|$|He had no {{conception}} {{of how long}} he lay. Five minutes passed before his legs made their first spasmodic movements, and, as he stumbled {{to his feet and}} rocked giddily, he had no thought of the passage of time. He had no thought about time at all. As a matter of course, his own idea, on which he proceeded to act without being aware of it, was that, a part of a second before, he had been struck a terrific blow magnified incalculable times beyond the <b>blow</b> of a <b>stick</b> at a nigger's hands.|$|R
60|$|It {{was in the}} {{quadrangle}} of {{the fort}} {{at the back of}} the batteries which command the road-stead of Valparaiso. The officer who had identified him had gone on without listening to his protestations. His doom was sealed; his hands were tied very tightly together behind his back; his body was sore all over from the many <b>blows</b> with <b>sticks</b> and butts of muskets which had hurried him along on the painful road from the place of his capture to the gate of the fort. This was the only kind of systematic attention the prisoners had received from their escort during a four days' journey across a scantily watered tract of country. At the crossings of rare streams they were permitted to quench their thirst by lapping hurriedly like dogs. In the evening a few scraps of meat were thrown amongst them as they dropped down dead-beat upon the stony ground of the halting-place.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{my theory}} is that he {{followed}} Drebber {{as far as the}} Brixton Road. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of which Drebber received a <b>blow</b> from the <b>stick,</b> in the pit of the stomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night was so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 11. Upon {{the least}} dispute between a Jew and a Persian, {{the former is}} {{immediately}} dragged before the Achund authority, and, if the complainant can bring forward two witnesses, the Jew is condemned to pay a heavy fine. If he is too poor to pay this penalty in money, he must pay it in his person. He is stripped to the waist, bound to a stake, and receives forty <b>blows</b> with a <b>stick.</b> Should the sufferer utter the least cry of pain during this proceeding, the blows already given are not counted, and the punishment is begun afresh.|$|R
2500|$|Acting under earlier {{instructions}} by Douglas, who {{had remained}} downstairs, to give Ogilby a [...] "good rompering", {{two members of}} the [...] "Heavy Squad", teenagers Henrietta Cowan (17) and Christine Smith (16), both of whom were wearing masks, proceeded to attack Ogilby. Cowan punched her forcefully in the face, knocking her to the floor. Ogilby was then kicked in the face, head, and stomach by both girls before <b>blows</b> from <b>sticks</b> were rained down upon her. When the two teenagers began battering Ogilby's face and head with bricks, Albert Graham and [...] "Heavy Squad" [...] member Josephine Brown (who was also masked), saw Ogilby's blood staining the hood and realising things had gone too far, started to panic and remonstrated with the girls to discontinue the beating. Cowan and Smith did stop, to smoke cigarettes and make plans to attend a disco that evening. Simpson suggested that during the attack, Ogilby had placed her hands inside the hood in a futile attempt to protect her face from the force of the bricks.|$|R
60|$|The man, {{who thought}} this savored of wit and {{impertinence}} (though the poor lad intended only {{to show his}} readiness to work), gave him a <b>blow</b> with a <b>stick</b> which broke his head so that the blood ran down. In this situation, and fainting for want of food, he laid himself down {{at the door of}} one Mr. Fitzwarren, a merchant, where the cook saw him, and, being an ill-natured hussy, ordered him to go about his business or she would scald him. At this time Mr. Fitzwarren came from the Exchange, and began also to scold at the poor boy, bidding him to go to work.|$|R
5000|$|... 8 minutes 37 seconds long. An Official film Black & White. Kingfish talks Andy {{into being}} a lion tamer at a carnival. Andy decides against it till Kingfish {{tells him that}} it is a fake lion, then Andy agrees. There is a real lion there but the one Andy is to [...] "tame" [...] is Crawford in front and Lightning in back in a lion skin. In a cage Andy struts his stuff with a whip while an {{obviously}} fake lion tries to avoid the stinging <b>blows</b> (with Crawford <b>sticking</b> his head out of the lion's mouth and telling Andy to be careful with that whip). The crowd (all black people) cheer throughout.|$|R
60|$|After two hours' {{travelling}} {{there was}} a halt {{for a quarter of}} an hour, and the doctor, passing along, spoke to Dick, and then walked with him back along the line to the hospital carts which were in the rear. Here Dick took his place among some bales of blankets, and another was thrown over him, {{in such a way that}} his presence there would not be suspected by any one riding past the cart. Upon the train proceeding Jack took charge of the two carts. This was an easy task, the oxen proceeding steadily along without deviating from the line, and requiring no attention whatever beyond an occasional shout and a <b>blow</b> of the <b>stick</b> when they loitered and left a gap in the line.|$|R
5000|$|Ndrezzata: The name of {{this dance}} comes from intrecciata, the braid. It is a {{specialty}} of Buonopane, {{a part of the}} commune of Barano d'Ischia, on the island of Ischia. Migrants to the Americas brought the dance to New York, where it was done on the streets in 1916 and 1917, and to Buenos Aires in 1924. In its classic form, the dance has 16 dancers, with men and women taking an equal part in the dance which is accompanied by drum, flute, and song. The men carry a small stick in their right hand and a wooden sword in the left, the women reverse this. The dance is in two parts, with seven tableaus in each part, and consists of a crossing and interlacing of <b>blows</b> of the <b>sticks</b> and swords.|$|R
6000|$|... "They were at once {{taken before}} the cadi. He heard my son's evidence, {{and then said}} that had it been proved they {{attempted}} to steal the horse, {{he would have had}} their heads smitten off, but that though this was doubtless their intention, they had not done so. He sentenced them to a hundred <b>blows</b> with a <b>stick,</b> and to be expelled from the town and neighbourhood, warning them that should they be found near the town again, they would assuredly be punished with death. I waited and saw the blows administered, and although I felt angry that the cadi had not ordered them to execution, I admit that the punishment was severe enough, and the wretches howled like whipped curs. I trust {{that there will be no}} more trouble from them. Still, I hope that this will not prevent your son coming to visit us." ...|$|R
6000|$|For his {{six months}} of life, Jerry knew a great deal and knew very little. He knew, without {{thinking}} about it, without knowing that he knew, why Biddy, the wise {{as well as the}} brave, did not act upon all the message that her heart voiced to him, and spring into the water and swim after him. She had protected him like a lioness when the big puarka (which, in Jerry's vocabulary, along with grunts and squeals, was the combination of sound, or word, for [...] "pig") had tried to devour him where he was cornered under the high-piled plantation house. Like a lioness, when the cook-boy had struck him with a stick to drive him out of the kitchen, had Biddy sprung upon the black, receiving without wince or whimper one straight <b>blow</b> from the <b>stick,</b> and then downing him and mauling him among his pots and pans until dragged (for the first time snarling) away by the unchiding Mister Haggin, who; however, administered sharp words to the cook-boy for daring to lift hand against a four-legged dog belonging to a god.|$|R
60|$|So quick was {{the action}} {{that he was}} upon Dick before {{he had time to}} strike a <b>blow</b> with his <b>stick.</b> He threw up his left arm to guard his head, but {{received}} a severe gash on the shoulders. At the same moment he struck out with his right, full into the face of the Mexican, who, as he staggered back, fell across the three men on the ground. Dick seized the opportunity to draw his pistol, dropping his stick as he did so, as his left arm was disabled. It was a double-barreled pistol and as the three natives rose and rushed at him, he shot the first. The other two sprang at him and he received a blow that almost paralyzed him. He staggered against the wall, but had strength to raise his arm and fire again, just as the man was about to repeat his blow; he fell forward on his face, and his other assailant took to his heels. A moment later Dick himself sank to the ground.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a simple}} story which he had to tell, and one which did but confirm our own deductions. His visitor, on {{entering}} his rooms, had drawn a life-preserver from his sleeve, and had so impressed him with the fear of instant and inevitable death that he had kidnapped him for the second time. Indeed, it was almost mesmeric, the effect which this giggling ruffian had produced upon the unfortunate linguist, for he could not speak of him save with trembling hands and a blanched cheek. He had been taken swiftly to Beckenham, and had acted as interpreter in a second interview, even more dramatic than the first, {{in which the two}} Englishmen had menaced their prisoner with instant death if he did not comply with their demands. Finally, finding him proof against every threat, they had hurled him back into his prison, and after reproaching Melas with his treachery, which appeared from the newspaper advertisement, they had stunned him with a <b>blow</b> from a <b>stick,</b> and he remembered nothing more until he found us bending over him.|$|R
6000|$|Willems moved languidly {{towards the}} river, then retraced his {{steps to the}} tree and let himself fall on the seat under its shade. On {{the other side of}} the immense trunk he could hear the old woman moving about, sighing loudly, muttering to herself, {{snapping}} dry <b>sticks,</b> <b>blowing</b> up the fire. After a while a whiff of smoke drifted round to where he sat. It made him feel hungry, and that feeling was like a new indignity added to an intolerable load of humiliations. He felt inclined to cry. He felt very weak. He held up his arm before his eyes and watched for a little while the trembling of the lean limb. Skin and bone, by God! How thin he was! [...] . He had suffered from fever a good deal, and now he thought with tearful dismay that Lingard, although he had sent him food--and what food, great Lord: a little rice and dried fish; quite unfit for a white man--had not sent him any medicine. Did the old savage think that he was like the wild beasts that are never ill? He wanted quinine.|$|R
60|$|The leaves {{had dropped}} from the trees overhead, and the {{branches}} outlined themselves against the blue sky, and dangled from their outer stems clusters of the unfallen fruit, as large as oranges, and only wanting a touch to send them plumping down into the grass where sometimes their fat hulls burst, and the nuts almost leaped into the boy's hands. The boys ran, {{some of them to}} gather the fallen nuts, and others to get clubs and rocks to beat them from the trees; one was sure to throw off his jacket and kick off his shoes and climb the tree to shake every limb where a walnut was still clinging. When they had got them all heaped up like a pile of grape-shot {{at the foot of the}} tree, they began to hull them, with <b>blows</b> of a <b>stick,</b> or with stones, and to pick the nuts from the hulls, where the grubs were battening on their assured ripeness, and to toss them into a little heap, a very little heap indeed compared with the bulk of that they came from. The boys gloried in getting as much walnut stain on their hands as they could, for it would not wash off, and it showed for days that they had been walnutting; sometimes they got to staining one another's faces with the juice, and pretending they were Indians.|$|R
