5000|$|A less {{favourable}} attitude against female same-sex {{relationships is}} evident in the poem of the humorist, Roberts Vizbulis, where the condemnable occurrences of fraud and corruption were caricatured as two lesbians ("two shifty ladies") in 1926. Newspaper [...] "Pēdējā Brīdī" [...] called the relationship of two Rigian women [...] "unnatural" [...] and themselves — abnormal women. One of them was the spouse of a rich wood seller but the other, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> <b>had</b> called off the engagement with a public sector employee. The women had frequently walked in Āgenskalna priedes in the evenings. One of them dressed in women's costume, the other in man's sport costume with newsboys cap on the head. Therefore, one was feminine and the other — masculine. The newspaper based the [...] "abnormality" [...] of the masculine partner on her hobbies — [...] "she had driven with men's bicycle, gone to the circus and admired the wrestlers and the neighbours <b>had</b> frequently seen <b>her</b> playing football in the yard. Moreover, one day at dawn <b>her</b> husband <b>had</b> caught <b>her</b> in a hotel room grasping and kissing a maiden, who had been half naked". Both left Latvia together.

When she is introduced, she attempts to steal the souls of boys at their school by using a Marilyn Monroe spirit. She captures Sakura and over a cup of tea tells her that she didn't <b>have</b> female friends <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> seductive ways. Renge met Sabato while walking to the admission exam of the Shinigami Elite High School. He <b>had</b> knocked <b>her</b> into a lake while trying to flee from a restaurant owner who he had stolen food from. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> that she missed the entrance exam and as compromise got into the Damashigami High School for Girls. That is why she holds a grudge against Sabato Rokudou who was said food thief. Still, it doesn't stop her from working with him to earn more money due to her poverty. Her black cat Tama is an elderly cat lady. Renge hates Ageha for the problems the airhead <b>had</b> caused <b>her</b> back in grade school and isn't above using whatever she can to get revenge on <b>her.</b> She also <b>has</b> a considerable, but one-sided crush on Kain that dates back to her middle school years.

40|$|Communicating is the {{way people}} {{interact}} to each other within a community. In order to communicate well, everybody uses a language for it expresses someone ideas as well as messages. However, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> his or <b>her</b> own dialects and idiolects, a person often gets difficulty either in expressing or understanding the messages uttered. The writer also experiences it when she reads the novel for the first time. Not knowing the system and particular verb forms produced, {{it is hard for}} her to understand it properly. Therefore, {{it is important to know}} the grammatical system of the person that we talk to. In this case, verb, one of the aspects in the syntactic component of the system, is the most essential one since it denotes an action, state, or at least part of the state. Verb is the core of a sentence in order to understand it. Captain Keeney, an uneducated person in the novel: 'ILE', shows characteristics of language in his utterances. Being a laborious man, he produces particular characteristics of verb forms which make his utterances hard to understand, particularly for foreign learners in reading it. Thus, the writer intends to investigate his forms of language, the verb forms and its grammatical characteristics. The writer analyses the captain's verb forms, the finite and non-finite verbs, the types of finite and non-finite verbs constructions, the forms of finite and non-finite verb components, and the grammatical characteristics of finite and non-finite verbs. In doing this research, the writer uses qualitative approach, that is describing in detail or specifically all verb constructions of Captain Keeney's speech. The writer acts as the instrument in collecting the data. She is the one who collects the data and analyzes them by using the Standard English. Concerning the study, the writer finds out that Captain Keeney produces some characteristics of verb forms. It is discovered that the captain produces both finite and non-finite verb forms. In terms of finite verb, he produces one verb, an auxiliary plus a verb, and special verb. In terms of non-finite verbs, he uses the -ing participle, the infinitive with to and without to, and the -ed participle. It is noted that full word and contracted word forms are produced too. He produces a short form of utterances for implying his messages: contracted form, dropping of auxiliaries, and the use of best instead <b>of</b> <b>had</b> better. The captain also uses a particular pronunciations, that is, consonant replacement. In addition, with respect to subject and verb relation, he produces some kind of rules or system in his speech...|$|R
