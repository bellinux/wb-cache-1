50|$|In 1997, {{upgrades}} {{unique to}} Romania {{were made to}} the rolling mill and the electric steel mill, with parts imported from Germany, Austria and Scotland. In 1999, steelmaking was halted due to lack of available capital, a situation that lasted until 2004, when production began anew at the country's only manufacturer of railway tracks. During this period, parts of the factory were dismantled piece by piece, with much of the 400,000 tons of metal used in its construction being sold as scrap. Reportedly, thefts went on day and night, with groups of scrap collectors from Călărași taking what they could. Firms for collecting scrap operated all around the factory perimeter, allegedly run by influential residents of the town who thus amassed significant wealth. The 600 km of internal railway were stripped <b>bare,</b> and <b>finished</b> products not yet unpacked are said to have gone directly to scrap.

In the late 1860s the wool manufacturers (based near Boston and Philadelphia) formed the first national lobby, and cut deals with wool-growing farmers in several states. Their challenge was that fastidious wool producers in Britain and Australia marketed a higher quality fleece than the careless Americans, and that British manufacturers had costs as low as the American mills. The result was a wool tariff that helped the farmers by a high rate on imported wool—a tariff the American manufacturers had to pay—together with a high tariff on <b>finished</b> woolens and <b>worsted</b> goods.|$|R

30|$|In {{the field}} tests, {{it must be}} noted that the floor impact sound {{insulation}} performance of the voided slab systems was performed without any floor finishing material or covering. The floors of apartment housing in South Korea commonly use standard floor finishings and structures for interlayer noise prevention, which generally consist of gypsum panels, lightweight porous concrete, side insulation, and finishing mortar. Additionally, it is reported that carpets and other soft resilient floor finishing material, such as carpet with rubber underlay, would be useful for reducing the influence of impact sound levels. However, the floor of this field test was bare, which means the finishing material or any type of noise resilient layers would be applied on top of the voided slab system. If the floor impact sound insulation performance test could be conducted after applying the construction finishing materials on top of the voided slab system, the floor impact sound insulation performance might be slightly better than that of the <b>bare</b> floor without <b>finishing.</b>|$|R
40|$|We are {{developing}} a novel process to grow passivating/antireflective (AR) coatings for terrestrial and space solar cells.

5000|$|By 1917, a {{thin white}} outline was usually {{added to the}} roundel, to make {{the blue of the}} outer circle easier to {{distinguish}} from the dark camouflage colours produced by the PC.10 or PC.12 protective doping.

50|$|By the early-1950s, the <b>bare</b> metal <b>finish</b> on most BEA {{aircraft}} {{had evolved}} to incorporate a burgundy cheatline separated by two thin, white lines above the cabin windows {{on each side}} of the fuselage. This cheatline was in turn separated by upper case, burgundy British European Airways titles in the middle. The bottom, burgundy part of this cheatline extended below the flightdeck windows to converge on the nose, with the space in-between painted black (matte finish) to reduce glare for the pilots and shield sensitive navigational equipment housed in the nose from radiation. There was a contemporary BEA logo {{on each side of}} the forward fuselage featuring a stylised wing and BEA in capital letters {{on each side of the}} nose. In addition to the aircraft registration, there was also a coat of arms on each side of the rear fuselage and a small Union flag each side of the lower part of the tail. The letters BEA appeared in bold, upper case on the upper left and lower right wing while the aircraft registration appeared in bold, upper case on the upper right and lower left wing. Later adaptations of this livery used on DC-3s/Pionairs featured an unbroken cheatline with large, upper case British European Airways titles on a white upper fuselage and a larger Union flag, as well as the aircraft registration each side of a white tail and the aircraft's name prominently displayed in a white field on the left side of the nose and a coat of arms on its right side. When applied to BEA's Elizabethans, this lacked British European Airways titles due to the aircraft's high-wing configuration that left insufficient space on the upper fuselage.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{successful}} {{trials of}} de Havilland's Heron Series 1 demonstrator G-ALZL on BEA's Channel Islands routes {{during the second}} half of 1951, the airline placed an order for two 1B series aircraft to replace [...] "Islander" [...] class Rapides on its Glasgow-Barra route as it was well-suited to serving restricted airfields in difficult weather conditions. Both aircraft were delivered in February 1955, wearing BEA's contemporary <b>bare</b> metal <b>finish</b> livery incorporating a burgundy cheatline separated by two thin, white lines above the cabin windows. In BEA service the Herons were known as [...] "Hebridean" [...] class aircraft seating 14 passengers on regular commercial flights. The Heron operated its first air ambulance service on 4 March 1955 while BEA crews were still undergoing conversion training on the new type. This was followed by a naming ceremony for both aircraft held at Glasgow's Renfrew Airport on 18 March 1955, when each aircraft was named after a Scottish medical pioneer (G-ANXA, the second aircraft to be delivered on 23 February 1955, was named John Hunter while G-ANXB, the first aircraft to be delivered on 12 February 1955, was named Sir James Young Simpson). Scheduled operations commenced on 18 April 1955, following which one aircraft was exclusively used on scheduled services while the other was kept on stand-by for air ambulance duties. An expansion of BEA's scheduled activities within the Scottish mainland as well as between the mainland and the Outer Hebrides, Orkneys and Shetlands necessitated the acquisition of a third aircraft to provide adequate cover for the air ambulance service. This resulted in an order for a third Heron 1B, which was delivered on 13 April 1956. This aircraft (G-AOFY, Sir Charles Bell) crashed on 28 September 1957 while on an air ambulance service to Port Ellen/Glenegedale Airport, Islay, Inner Hebrides, with the loss of the pilot, [...] and duty nurse on board.|$|R
50|$|Choosing {{the right}} finish for metal {{furniture}} {{is important because}} of its durability. Some {{of the most common}} finishes include chrome plating, plastic, painted, brass and anodized finishes. Chrome plating, although durable, is thin and if damaged where it is exposed to air, scratches can rust. Plastic-coated finishes are synthetically made and good as they prevent rusting or the metal changing color from air exposure. Although they're as strong as paint finishes, they do not hold up as well as electroplated finishes. Paint finishes are for both steel and aluminum furniture, although it easily scratches and rusts. Brass plating, which is an electroplated finish, is applied in a bath and is durable. Solid brass is both pricey and rare. To decide if a finish is solid brass put a magnet on the furniture and if it clings, it is made of brass-plated steel (iron in the steel is magnetic). Brass is made from copper and zinc, two metals that are prone to corrosion from exposure to (salty) water or air. Brass finishes should be oiled or clear-coated with polyurethane or a similar material to make a barrier from air and water to prevent corrosion. Corrosion is slowed when a surface is already oxidized, for example aluminum is very hard to weld because of its persistent aluminum oxide layer, this prevents access to the <b>bare</b> metal. Anodized <b>finishes</b> are used on aluminum furniture to increase the thickness of the aluminum oxide layer, creating a thicker barrier between the atmosphere and aluminum base metal.|$|R
40|$|Cor-Ten is a {{particular}} kind of steel, belonging to low-alloyed steel; thanks to his aesthetic features and resistance to atmospheric corrosion, this material is largely used in architectural, artistic and infrastructural applications. After environmental exposure, Cor-Ten steel exhibits the characteristic ability to self-protect from corrosion, by the development of a stable and adherent protective layer. However, some environmental factors can influence the formation and stability of the patina. In particular, exposure of Cor-Ten to polluted atmosphere (NOx, SOx, O 3) or coastal areas (marine spray) may cause problems to the protective layer and, as a consequence, a release of alloying metals, which can accumulate near the structures. Some of these metals, such as Cr and Ni, could be very dangerous for soils and water because of their large toxicity. The aim of this work was to study the corrosion behavior of Cor-Ten exposed to an urban-coastal site (Rimini, Italy). Three different kinds of commercial surface <b>finish</b> (<b>bare</b> and pre-patinated, with or without a beeswax covering) were examined, both in sheltered and unsheltered exposure conditions. Wet deposition brushing the specimens surface (leaching solutions) are monthly collected and analyzed to evaluate the extent of metal release and the form in which they leave the surface, for example, as water-soluble compounds or non-adherent corrosion products. Five alloying metals (Fe, Cu, Cr, Mn and Ni) and nine ions (Cl-, NO 3 -, NO 2 -, SO 42 -, Na+, Ca 2 +, K+, Mg 2 +, NH 4 +) are determined through Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy and Ion Chromatography, respectively. Furthermore, the evolution and the behaviour of the patina are periodically followed by surface investigations (SEM-EDS and Raman Spectroscopy). After two years of exposure, the results show that Bare Cor-Ten, cheaper than the other analyzed specimens, even though undergoes the greater mass variation, his metal release is comparable to the release of the pre-patinated samples. The behavior of pre-patinated steel, with or without beeswax covering, do not show particular difference. This exposure environment doesn’t allow a completely stabilization of the patina; nevertheless an estimate of metal release after 10 years of exposure points out that the environmental impact of Cor-Ten is very low: for example, the release of chromium in the soluble fraction is less than 10 mg if we consider an exposed wall of 10 m 2...|$|R
