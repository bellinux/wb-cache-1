40|$|Inhaled <b>beta-agonists</b> are {{commonly}} used as bronchodilators {{in the treatment of}} asthma. Their use in athletes, however, is restricted by anti-doping regulations. Controversies remain as to whether healthy elite athletes who use bronchodilators may gain a competitive advantage. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the effects of inhaled and systemic <b>beta-agonists</b> on physical performance in healthy, non-asthmatic subjects. To this end, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched up to August 2009. Reference lists were searched for additional relevant studies. The search criteria were for randomized controlled trials examining the effect of inhaled or systemic <b>beta-agonists</b> on physical performance in healthy, non-asthmatic subjects. Two authors independently performed the selection of studies, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Parallel-group and crossover trials were analysed separately. Mean difference (MD) and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for continuous data and, where possible, data were pooled using a fixed effects model. Twenty-six studies involving 403 participants (age range 7 - 30 years) compared inhaled <b>beta-agonists</b> with placebo. No significant effect could be detected for inhaled <b>beta-agonists</b> on maximal oxygen consumption (VO(max)) [MD - 0. 14 mL. kg(1). min(1); 95 % CI - 1. 07, 0. 78; 16 studies], endurance time to exhaustion at 105 - 110 % VO(max) (MD - 1. 5 s; 95 % CI - 15. 6, 12. 6; four studies), 20 -km time trial duration (MD - 4. 4 s; 95 % CI - 23. 5, 14. 7; two studies), peak power (MD - 0. 14 W. kg(1); 95 % CI - 0. 54, 0. 27; four studies) and total work during a 30 -second Wingate test (MD 0. 80 J. kg(1); 95 % CI - 2. 44, 4. 05; five studies). Thirteen studies involving 172 participants (age range 7 - 22 years) compared systemic <b>beta-agonists</b> with placebo, with 12 studies involving oral and one study involving intravenous salbutamol. A significant effect was detected for systemic <b>beta-agonists</b> on endurance time to exhaustion at 80 - 85 % VO(max) (MD 402 s; 95 % CI 34, 770; two studies), but not for VO(max) (placebo 42. 5 +/- 1. 7 mL. kg(1). min(1), salbutamol 42. 1 +/- 2. 9 mL. kg(1). min(1), one study), endurance time to exhaustion at 70 % VO(max) (MD 400 s; 95 % CI - 408, 1208; one study) or power output at 90 % VO(max) (placebo 234. 9 +/- 16 W, salbutamol 235. 5 +/- 18. 1 W, one study). A significant effect was shown for systemic <b>beta-agonists</b> on peak power (MD 0. 91 W. kg(1); 95 % CI 0. 25, 1. 57; four studies), but not on total work (MD 7. 8 J. kg(1); 95 % CI - 3. 3, 18. 9; four studies) during a 30 -second Wingate test.

The <b>beta-agonists</b> were eluted with a mixture of tert. -butylmethyl ether and hexane. Then the extract was further cleaned with a mixed mode SPE column, or with a combination of immunoaffinity chromatography (IAC) and the mixed mode SPE column. The IAC column contained antibodies against salbutamol, which were suitable for multiresidue extractions. The extract was then brought onto a mixed mode SPE column at an acidic pH. The column was washed with 70 % methanol in water. Thereafter, the <b>beta-agonists</b> were eluted with ammoniated ethanol-hexane. The extract was analysed with an HPLC method with electrochemical detection. The <b>beta-agonists</b> were separated on a reversed-phase column using a mobile phase buffered at pH 5. 5 and containing an ion-pair reagent. Recoveries were higher when the IAC procedure was not performed (90 - 105 % vs. 65 - 75 %), but the extracts were cleaner when the latter step was included. Detection limits in human and calf urine were in the low ng/ml range.

ObjectivesWe tested the hypothesis that responses of lung function to 3 months of combined inhalation of long-acting <b>beta-agonist</b> and corticosteroid might differ among patients with various COPD subtypes. MethodsWe classified 165 COPD patients into four subtypes according to the severity of emphysema and airflow obstruction: emphysema-dominant, obstruction-dominant, mild-mixed, and severe-mixed. The emphysema-dominant subtype was defined by an emphysema index on computed tomography of more than 20 % and FEV 1 more than 45 % of the predicted value. The obstruction-dominant subtype had an emphysema index≤ 20 % and FEV 1 ≤ 45 %, the mild-mixed subtype had an emphysema index≤ 20 % and FEV 1 > 45 %, and the severe-mixed subtype had an emphysema index> 20 % and FEV 1 ≤ 45 %. Patients were recruited prospectively and treated with 3 months of combined inhalation of long-acting <b>beta-agonist</b> and corticosteroid. ResultsAfter 3 months of combined inhalation of long-acting <b>beta-agonist</b> and corticosteroid, obstruction-dominant subtype patients showed a greater FEV 1 increase and more marked dyspnea improvement than did the emphysema-dominant subgroup.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the percentage of asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits made by patients who recently ran out of their inhaled short-acting <b>beta-agonists</b> or inhaled corticosteroids and to characterize this understudied patient population. A secondary analysis was performed of data from four ED-based multicenter studies of acute asthma during 1996 – 1998 (n 64 EDs). In each study, consecutive adult patients, aged 18 – 54 years, with acute asthma underwent a structured interview that assessed running out of inhaled medications. The analytic cohort comprised 1095 adults. Overall, 324 patients (30 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 27 – 32 %) ran out of either of their inhaled <b>beta-agonists</b> or inhaled corticosteroids during the week before their index ED visit; 311 (28 %; 95 % CI, 26 – 31 %) ran out of inhaled <b>beta-agonists</b> per se. Among a subset of 518 patients on inhaled corticosteroids, 55 patients (11 %; 95 % CI, 8 – 14 %) ran out of inhaled corticosteroids. In the multivariable model, predictors of running out of an asthma medication were male sex, non-Hispanic black race, Hispanic ethnicity, no insurance, lower household income, and use of EDs as the preferred source of asthma prescriptions (all p 0. 05). Among patients who ran out of medications, 49 % (95 % CI, 43 – 55 %) ran out of inhaled <b>beta-agonists</b> and 72 % (95 % CI, 58 – 84 %) ran out of inhaled corticosteroids, before onset of their acute asthma symptoms.
