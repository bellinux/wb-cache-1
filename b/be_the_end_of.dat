5|$|Because {{of the low}} wage at América Mineiro, he {{was forced}} to quit {{football}} to take various jobs as a labourer, a carpenter, and a worker in a sweet factory. It looked as if this would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his childhood dream. As a factory-worker Gilberto earned the equivalent of about £50 a month by 2002 rates. After three years of working in a factory, the 18-year-old decided to try his luck at football again by enrolling in the local club's youth academy. His time in the academy did not last long due to the worsening situation at home {{as a result of his}} mother's ill health; he returned to work in the sweet factory with little hope of resurrecting his football career.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, the Ivory Coast {{were drawn}} {{in a group}} with Nigeria, Mali and underdogs Benin. Drogba scored two goals in the group stage, opening the scoring in the 4–1 win over Benin, {{as well as in}} the 3–0 win over Mali. In the quarter-finals, Drogba was on the score sheet once again in the 5–0 win over Guinea with the last four goals coming in the final twenty minutes. The semi-final was a rematch of the 2006 final against Egypt, but it was to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the road for Drogba and the Ivory Coast, losing 4–1 to the {{eventual}} champions. On 9 February, Drogba lost 4–2 to hosts Ghana and thus ended their run in the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, the US 2nd Infantry Division, {{with several}} armor and antiaircraft {{artillery}} units, {{was ordered to}} proceed to the Far East. The next day, MacArthur requested that the 2nd Division be brought to full war strength, if possible, without delaying its departure. He also reiterated his need of the units required to bring the four infantry divisions already in the Far East to full war strength. He detailed these as four heavy tank battalions, 12 heavy tank companies, 11 infantry battalions, 11 field artillery battalions, and four antiaircraft automatic weapons battalions per division. By August 7, the US 9th Infantry Regiment was operational in Korea, and {{had been sent to}} the Naktong Bulge area. However it would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the month before the rest of the 2nd Infantry Division arrived in Korea.|$|E

50|$|Termination, as used by Quaternary geologists, oceanographers, and paleoclimatologists <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{period of}} time during an glacial cycle {{when there is a}} {{relatively}} rapid transition from full glacial climates to full interglacial climates. For the Quaternary period, terminations are numbered using Roman numerals from the most recent termination as “I” and with increasing value, e.g. “II”, “III”, and so forth, into the past. Termination I, also known as the Last Glacial Termination, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Marine isotope stage 2; Termination II <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Marine Isotope Stage 6; Termination III <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Marine Isotope Stage 8; Termination IV <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Marine Isotope Stage 10, and so forth.|$|R

5|$|The {{events of}} the Second Test also {{affected}} the career paths of other players. England's inability to cut down the Australians resulted in the dropping of three of their bowlersWright, Laker and Coxonafter the Lord's Test. Coxon's debut was his only Test match, something believed to be caused more by off-field events than sporting merit. There was a story that he punched Comptonwhom he disliked and considered self-importantin the dressing room, but Coxon always denied this. However, there was certainly an altercation and Coxon was never selected again. The match was the last ever Test for Brown, who had struggled out of position in the middle-order, scoring 73 runs at 24.33 in three Test innings during the season. He had scored centuries on his previous Test outings at Lord's in 1934 and 1938, but the third visit proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his international career.|$|E
5|$|This however {{was not to}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> General Nansouty's {{action at}} the great Battle of Wagram. Although the great cavalry attack had done much to ease the {{pressure}} on Napoleon's left-centre, the latter's situation remained critical. The Emperor thus launched the Corps of General Jacques MacDonald in an attack against the Austrian right-centre. MacDonald's attack formation, formed by chance more than by any tactical forethought, was a huge infantry attack column or square, comprising all his divisions in a deep formation that was highly unusual for Napoleonic warfare. Four squadrons of Nansouty's carabiniers-à-cheval were sent to support the flank of this attack, {{with the rest of}} his division further back. Realising that his advance is hampered by intense Austrian artillery fire, MacDonald aimed to clear the enemy guns before him, asking for a cavalry charge from Walther's Guard cavalry on his right and Nansouty's 1st heavy cavalry division on his left. With no direct orders from the Emperor and his commander, Marshal Bessières, out of action, Walther opted not to move, while Nansouty did send his men forward but, having been positioned too far back, he arrived only after the enemy guns had moved away.|$|E
