She had been startled by the sudden appearance of her mistress in the passage, staring about her wildly, like {{a woman who had}} gone out of her senses. Almost at the same moment [...] "the master" [...] had flung open the drawing-room door. He had caught Mrs. Dethridge by the arm, had dragged her into the room, and had closed the door again. After the two had remained shut up together for more than half an hour, Mrs. Dethridge had come out, as pale as ashes, and had gone up stairs trembling like a person in great terror. Some time later, when the servant was in bed, but not asleep, she had seen a light under her door, in the narrow wooden passage which separated Anne's bedroom from Hester's bedroom, and by which she obtained access to her own little sleeping-chamber beyond. She had got out of bed; had looked through the keyhole; and had seen [...] "the master" [...] and Mrs. Dethridge standing together examining the walls of the passage. [...] "The master" [...] had laid his hand upon the wall, {{on the side of his}} wife's room, and had looked at Mrs. Dethridge. And Mrs. Dethridge had looked back at him, and had shaken her head. Upon that he had said in a whisper (still with his hand on the wooden wall), [...] "Not to be done here?" [...] And Mrs. Dethridge had shaken her head. He had considered a moment, and had whispered again, [...] "The other room will do! won't it?" [...] And Mrs. Dethridge had nodded her head--and so they had parted. That was the story of the night. Early in the morning, more strange things had happened. The master had gone out, with a large sealed packet in his hand, covered with many stamps; taking his own letter to the post, instead of sending the servant with it as usual. On his return, Mrs. Dethridge had gone out next, and had come back with something in a jar which she had locked up in her own sitting-room. Shortly afterward, a working-man had brought a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>laths,</b> and some mortar and plaster of Paris, which had been carefully placed together in a corner of the scullery. Last, and most remarkable in the series of domestic events, the girl had received permission to go home and see her friends in the country, on that very day; having been previously informed, when she entered Mrs. Dethridge's service, that she was not to expect to have a holiday granted to her until after Christmas. Such were the strange things which had happened in the house since the previous night. What was the interpretation to be placed on them? ...|$|E

The average austenite/martensite orientation relationship determined by an accurate method is (111) f || (011) b and [[MATH] 01]f 3. 90 from [[MATH][MATH] 1]b, while the habit plane <b>of</b> the <b>laths</b> is close to (575) f or ([MATH] 54) b. Adjacent laths within a packet <b>of</b> <b>laths</b> adopt the same variant of the orientation relationship, but may be misoriented relative to each other by about 2 °. The martensite laths contain screw dislocations in all four b directions, but one set of the four is clearly dominant. The martensite/austenite interface on one side <b>of</b> a <b>lath</b> is planar, while that {{on the opposite side}} is irregular. Dislocation tangles in the austenite associated with the irregular interface suggest that the laths thicken mainly in the direction away from the initial planar interface. The martensite/austenite interface contains a single set of dislocations with Burgers vector ab/ 2 [1 [MATH] 1] = af/ 2 [0 [MATH] 1], which form loops around the laths. The observed interface dislocation structure satisfies the requirements for a glissile semi-coherent interface...|$|R
50|$|An {{advantage}} <b>of</b> using <b>lath</b> is for ornamental {{or unusual}} shapes.

60|$|The guess {{was a good}} one, {{for when}} he peeped in the pail Walter found that it {{contained}} {{a couple of dozen}} minnows. Together the three walked over to where Hal was just finishing the last hole. The doctor took from under his arm a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> short pieces <b>of</b> <b>lath,</b> each about eighteen inches long, tapering toward one end, to which was fastened a bit of red flannel. Two inches from the other end was a hole big enough for one of the alder sticks to pass through freely. Fastened close to the end, and neatly wound around it, was a short length of stout line on the end of which was a hook with wire snell. Unwinding one of these lines the doctor passed one of the alder sticks {{through the hole in the}} lath, baited the hook with a lively minnow and dropped it through the hole in the ice. The alder stick was placed across this so that the lath came in the middle and lay on the ice at right angles. A pull on the line would drag the end <b>of</b> the <b>lath</b> down, making it stand upright with its little red signal on the end, and that was all there was to it.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} by which fracture partitions between intergranular and “quasi-cleavage” in a hydrogen embrittled lath martensitic steel has been examined. Intense plasticity is found under both intergranular and “quasi-cleavage” fracture surfaces with differencing slip band orientation relative to lath structures. In the intergranular fracture case, slip bands are parallel to the longitudinal direction <b>of</b> <b>laths</b> and the intersection between the slip bands and the interface is inclined to the prior austenite grain boundary, whereas in the “quasi-cleavage” fracture case, slip bands are inclined to the longitudinal direction <b>of</b> <b>laths</b> and the intersection is inclined {{with respect to the}} lath boundaries. Further, greater hydrogen accumulation is visualized in the vicinity of a grain boundary on a “quasi-cleavage” fracture surface. It is posited that local stress and hydrogen concentration provide for hydrogen-enhanced and plasticity-mediated failure by decohesion at prior austenite grain and lath boundaries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{microstructural}} development <b>of</b> cold-rolled <b>lath</b> martensite {{structure in}} the low carbon steels and ultra-low carbon steels are studied and compared. In low carbon steel of as-quenched specimens, very thin austenite films exist at boundaries <b>of</b> adjacent <b>laths,</b> but do not exist in ultra-low carbon steel. After cold rolling for the low carbon steel, the lamellar dislocation cells, irregularly bent laths and kinked laths regions are frequently observed and, in some instances, the disappearance <b>of</b> initial <b>lath</b> boundaries is observed. The existence of retained austenite films suggests that the lath boundaries rarely disappear during cold-rolling in the low carbon steel...|$|R

40|$|Literature {{presents}} extensive {{experimental evidence}} of large deformation and ductile fracture behaviour <b>of</b> <b>lath</b> martensite in martensitic and multi-phase high strength steels under quasi-static, uniaxial loading conditions. The physical origin of this apparent ductile behaviour of martensite is not clear, since martensite generally provides a high material strength. The presence of thin films of interlath retained austenite may trigger the observed apparent martensite ductility. The present contribution investigates {{the role played}} by interlath retained austenite on the mechanics <b>of</b> <b>lath</b> martensite by means of crystal plasticity simulations. It is shown that independently from the interlath retained austenite volume fraction and the exact lath morphology, localized shearing along the lath habit plane occurs {{as long as there are}} enough carriers for plasticity. The austenite film acts like a 'greasy' plane on which the stiffer laths can slide. The shearing mechanism is not a mere consequence of the lower flow stress in the austenitic phase, but it is largely due to the orientation relationship between the retained austenite face centred cubic lattice and the body centred cubic lath crystals...|$|R
