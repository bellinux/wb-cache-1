5|$|Elemental iodine is {{slightly}} soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450ml at 20°C and 1280ml at 50°C; potassium iodide may {{be added to}} increase solubility via formation of triiodide ions, among other polyiodides. Nonpolar solvents such as hexane and carbon tetrachloride provide a higher solubility. Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as Lewis bases; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of iodine vapour. Charge-transfer complexes form when iodine is dissolved in polar solvents, hence changing the colour. Iodine is violet when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and saturated hydrocarbons <b>but</b> <b>deep</b> brown in alcohols and amines, solvents that form charge-transfer adducts.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Zeke {{originated}} from a tropical wave that was first identified off {{the west coast}} of Africa on October6, 1992. Initially, well-organized convection was associated with the system as it tracked westward; however, once over the Caribbean Sea, shower and thunderstorm activity diminished. Between October21 and 23, the poorly defined wave moved across Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean. Over the following few days, convection gradually increased and the system became better organized. On October25, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to classify it as Tropical Depression Twenty-Seven-E, at which time the storm was situated roughly 805mi (1,295km) south of the southern tip of Baja California Sur, Mexico.

25|$|During World War I, Fleming {{witnessed}} {{the death of}} many soldiers from sepsis resulting from infected wounds. Antiseptics, which were used {{at the time to}} treat infected wounds, often worsened the injuries. In an article he submitted for the medical journal The Lancet during World War I, Fleming described an ingenious experiment, which he was able to conduct {{as a result of his}} own glass blowing skills, in which he explained why antiseptics were killing more soldiers than infection itself during World War I. Antiseptics worked well on the surface, <b>but</b> <b>deep</b> wounds tended to shelter anaerobic bacteria from the antiseptic agent, and antiseptics seemed to remove beneficial agents produced that protected the patients in these cases at least as well as they removed bacteria, and did nothing to remove the bacteria that were out of reach. Sir Almroth Wright strongly supported Fleming's findings, but despite this, most army physicians over the course of the war continued to use antiseptics even in cases where this worsened the condition of the patients.|$|E

[...] Boone received some tutoring from family members, though his spelling remained unorthodox. The historian John Mack Faragher cautions that the folk image of Boone as semiliterate is misleading, and argues that he [...] "acquired a level of literacy that was the equal of most men of his times." [...] Boone regularly took reading material with him on his hunting expeditions—the Bible and Gulliver's Travels were favorites. He was often the only literate person in groups of frontiersmen. Boone would sometimes entertain his hunting companions by reading to them around the evening campfire.|$|E

The sizable, horizontally oval eyes are a reflective green in life and lack nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids); they are followed a short distance behind by much smaller spiracles (accessory respiratory openings). The nostrils are anteriorly placed and preceded by short flaps of skin. The mouth is wide and evenly arched, with thin lips and short <b>but</b> <b>deep</b> furrows around the corners.

500|$|Director John Woo has {{described}} The Killer as being about [...] "honour and friendship", [...] "trying {{to find out}} if there is something common between two people" [...] and as a [...] "romantic poem". The structure of the film follows two men {{on opposite sides of the}} law who find a relation to each other in their opposition to a greater evil, Wong Hoi, a Triad boss. Li and Ah Jong's relationship was influenced by the Spy vs. Spy comics from Mad Magazine. Woo recalled [...] "When I was young I was fascinated with the cartoon–I love it very much ... the white bird and the black bird are always against each other, <b>but</b> <b>deep</b> in their heart, they are still friendly, and the idea came from that." [...] Woo uses Ah Jong and Li as a central motif to illustrate moral points. Scenes with this reflective doubling include the hospital sequence with Li and Ah Jong on opposite sides of a hospital hall and in the final battle scene where Li and Ah Jong are in a standoff with Wong. The focus on male friendships in Woo's film have been interpreted as homoerotic. Woo has responded to these statements stating [...] "People will bring their own preconceptions to a movie .... If they see something in The Killer that they consider to be homoerotic then that is their privilege. It's certainly not intentional." ...|$|E
