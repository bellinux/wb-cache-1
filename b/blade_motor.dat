Circular saws can be either left or right-handed, depending {{on the side of the}} <b>blade</b> where the <b>motor</b> sits. A left-handed saw is typically easier to use if held in the right hand, and contrariwise for the right-handed saw, because the user does not need to lean across the saw to see the cutting line.|$|R
40|$|Computer {{cooling fan}} noise is studied theoretically, {{focusing}} on the radiation from the interaction between rotor <b>blades</b> and <b>motor</b> struts. The source is decomposed into axial thrust, circumferential drag, and radial force. There is no sound-power coupling among the three components. The index of spatial spinning pressure mode plays the key role in noise radiation. The leading modes are the zeroth, or coincident, mode for thrust and the first mode for the drag and radial force. The effect of source noncompactness is quantified and found to be substantial only for higher-order radiation modes. The sound powers of the leading modes follow a sixth-power law, while the next high-order modes follow an eighth-power law. Quantitative analysis shows that the drag force can be equally noisy as the coincident thrust force. Based on an empirical aerodynamic model of rotor-strut interaction, {{it is found that}} the total sound power is more sensitive to the number of struts than rotor blades. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate how the struts can be optimized for typical cooling fan conditions. © 2003 Acoustical Society of America. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Ventilation 1. Install thermostats to control fans so they are on when needed and shut off when not needed. Research has indicated that cows begin to show mild heat stress at 74 ˚F and 75 % relative humidity, so thermostats should be set between 70 ˚F and 75 ˚F. 2. Clean fan <b>blades,</b> guards, <b>motors,</b> thermostats and shutters monthly. a. Dust build-up on motors increases operating temperatures and can lead to overheating. b.

This method couples near-field {{results from a}} full-potential finite-difference method with a new Kirchhoff integral formulation to extend the finite-difference results into the acoustic far-field. This Kirchhoff formula is written in a blade-fixed coordinate system. It requires initial data from the potential code on a plane at the sonic radius. A recent hovering rotor experiment is described where accurate pressure measurements were recorded on the sonic cylinder and at 2 and 3 radii. The potential code prediction of sonic cylinder pressures is excellent.

40|$|Molecular motors of {{the cell}} are protein-based, {{nanoscale}} machines, which {{use a variety of}} strategies to transduce chemical energy into mechanical work {{in the presence of a}} large thermal background. The design and construction of artificial molecular motors is one approach to better understand their basic physical principles. Here, we propose the concept of a protein-based, burnt-bridges ratchet, inspired by biological examples. Our concept, the lawnmower, utilizes protease blades to cleave peptide substrates, and uses the asymmetric substrate-product interface arising from productive cleavage to bias subsequent diffusion on the track (lawn). Following experimental screening to select a protease to act as the <b>motor's</b> <b>blades,</b> we chemically couple trypsin to quantum dots and demonstrate activity of the resulting lawnmower construct in solution. Accompanying Brownian dynamics simulations illustrate the importance for processivity of correct protease density on the quantum dot and spacing of substrates on the track.

This technique revolutionized diagnostic medicine since it enabled doctors to view the slices of internal organs of the patient using x-rays. For the same reason, the method is being used in industry for applicationa such as inspection of turbine <b>blades,</b> rocket <b>motors,</b> ceramics, electronic components, castings, etc. The mathematical basis of CT was established by J. Radon in 1917 when he showed {{that it is possible}} to determine the value of a function over a region of space if the set of line integrals is known for all ray paths through the region. In the case of CT, the line integrals are derived from the x-ray intensities sensed by the detectors, and the function to be determined is the distribution of the x-ray attenuation coefficient over the object. However, the large number of calculations needed to accomplish the reconstruction ruled out any practical application to x-ray data until the availability of relatively rapid computers. Hounsfiled and Cornack first received a nobel prize in 1979 in medicine for their x-ray brain scanner with reconstruction time of 2 days. Since then several advances have been made resulting in fast reconstruction algorithms. Fourier weighted backprojection developed by Ramchandran and Laxminarayan is one of the most commonly used algorithm. This algorithm bring out the splendor and power of mathematical formulation of a problem. With very few assumptions, cross-sectional view of an object can be obtained with unprecedented accuracy.

40|$|A cassava stem {{cutting unit}} was {{developed}} to generate the design data for its use on a prototype of a cassava planter. It consisted of a 25. 5 cm circular saw blade, cam mechanism, bottom plate, electric motor (0. 75 kW) to operate saw <b>blade</b> and a <b>motor</b> (0. 37 kW). The cassava stems were fed manually into a feeding chute for free fall on to the bottom plate, and then these were cut by the circular saw operated by an electric motor. The cam mechanism operated by the cam motor, controlled the number of cuts by the circular saw. The cutting length could be adjusted between 15 and 30 cm by altering {{the position of the}} bottom plate. Test results indicated that the highest cutting quality of this unit at more than 60 number of circular saw teeth when operated at faster than 1, 200 rpm cutting shaft speed and slower than 50 rpm cam shaft speed.

50|$|A blender {{consists}} of a housing, <b>motor,</b> <b>blades,</b> and food container. A fan-cooled electric motor is secured into the housing by way of vibration dampers, and a small output shaft penetrates the upper housing and meshes with the blade assembly. Usually, a small rubber washer provides a seal around the output shaft to prevent liquid from entering the motor. Most blenders today have multiple speeds. As a typical blender has no gearbox, the multiple speeds are often implemented using a universal motor with multiple stator windings and/or multi-tapped stator windings; in a blender with electromechanical controls, the button (or other electrical switching device or position) for each different speed connects a different stator winding/tap or combination thereof. Each different combination of energized windings produces a different torque from the motor, which yields a different equilibrium speed in balance against the drag (resistance to rotation) of the blade assembly {{in contact with the}} material inside the food container. A notable exception from the mid-1960s is the Oster Model 412 Classic VIII (with the single knob) providing the lowest speed (Stir) using the aforementioned winding tap method but furnishing higher speeds (the continuously variable higher speed range is marked Puree to Liquify) by means of a mechanical speed governor that balances the force provided by flyweights against a spring force varied by the control knob when it is switched into the higher speed range. With this arrangement, when not set to the Stir speed, motor speed is constant even with varying load up to the point where power demanded by the load is equal to the motor's power capability at a particular speed. The more modern version of this arrangement is electronic speed control found on some units.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of Optiwind (now defunct), {{there appears to be}} a growing body of {{evidence}} that they believe have solved for both the acceleration and economic challenges posed by CWAT/DAWT designs. Where previous attempts at new designs in this category have focused purely on acceleration magnitude, Optiwind appears to have taken a more holistic approach to their design, considering cost as much as acceleration benefit. In addition, the ongoing operational and maintenance cost of the entire unit appears to be successfully addressed in this design. It is absent the significant cost drivers of HAWT systems - large composite <b>blades,</b> gearbox, yaw <b>motor,</b> pitch control, lubrication, etc. In addition, the novel foundation geometry appears to have mitigated the structural challenges of the conventional monopole foundation design, which was originally conceived to offset the counter-rotational effects ("wobbling") of large, three blade turbines. As such, it is reasonable to assume that Optiwind's holistic approach to systemwide costs have led to a series of designs and discoveries that can realistically deliver the economic advantages of accelerated wind at a cost that is less than the net system cost. This is accurate if the Optiwind system is compared to a HAWT purely on rating. The problem therein is, if one compares the Optiwind design based on its stack height (the distance from its lowest turbine to the highest turbine) to a traditional HAWT of the same diameter, the overall power output of the machine is 20% less than that of the HAWT, with all the attendant material and structural expenses generally associated with a CWAT/DAWT. On average a CWAT/DAWT system would need to produce at least 2-3 times the energy a HAWT could produce from the maximum area used by the CWAT/DAWT in order to offset the substantially larger material costs. There is no evidence yet that there are any DAWT/CWAT designs capable of this level of increase when compared on an apples to apples basis with HAWT's.|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} the underlying principles by which biological motors operate, recent work has focused both on understanding their operational principles, and on designing new molecular motors ab initio. Here, by studying and designing motors which use Brownian motion and track asymmetry to bias the direction of motion, I gained insight into the underlying principles by which such motors operate. "Molecular spiders" [JACS. 128, 12693 (2006) ] are one example of synthetic biomolecular walkers able to generate biased motion by coupling the chemical asymmetry arising from substrate binding and cleavage to bias their mechanical stepping. These DNA-based motors diffuse to their substrate track where productive binding between a molecular spider’s DNAzyme leg and a ssDNA substrate facilitates cleavage of the substrate. Once cleaved, the decreased binding affinity between the DNAzyme and resulting product allows the motor to diffuse along the track and form new interactions with uncleaved substrate molecules. Toinvestigate the origin of biased motion of molecular spiders, I have performed Monte Carlo simulations. Using my simulations, I also investigated their performance as molecular motors, and determined how to optimize their motor properties by modifying tunable experimental parameters in spider design. These studies assisted us {{in the design and}} construction of a novel protein-based synthetic motor, the "Lawnmower", which uses a burnt–bridges type of mechanism, the same as spiders, to autonomously and diffusively move forward. The lawnmower has trypsin proteases as blades, linked to a quantum dot hub, that interact with a one-dimensional peptide substrate track via binding to and cleavage of the substrates. Experimentally, it is confirmed with kinetic assays that ourlawnmower is an active motor and that there are an average number of 8 <b>blades</b> on each <b>motor.</b> I also outlined the synthesis and characterization of a highly modified DNA-peptide construct, which acts as the track for the lawnmower. For this, I employed PCR to generate a densely labeled DNA and click chemistry for peptide conjugation to the functionalized DNA. As an additional motors-relatedproject, I present the synthesis of a long one-dimensional DNA track with periodically repeating elements that provide specific binding sites for the "Tumbleweed" molecular motor...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1952 Presentation date: 1951 - 12 - 04 Turkey is an {{agricultural}} country where exchange and shipping of goods has been gravely hampered {{in the past}} by lack of highways. The railroads have large expanses of land between them, and highway construction {{in the past has}} been limited to strategic roads and connections of cities to railways. Unless capital changes occur in the balance of the country's foreign trade, non-military motor vehicles cannot be expected to surpass greatly the 60, 000 figure. On this basis, most of the recently designated National System highways will not earn in user taxes the yearly cost accruing against them from capital investment and maintenance charges. The problem confronting the Turkish General Directorate of Highways is done consequently one one or designing roads that fro the lowest capital investment will reduce trucking costs to a level that will encourage farm production and distribution of consumer goods throughout the country. The design speeds that have been arrived at in this thesis are 60 - 70 m. p. h. on flat terrain, 50 - 60 m. p. h. on rolling country, and in mountainous areas 40 m. p. h., dropping to 30 and 25 m. p. h. on short sections through mountainous terrain. Capital investment can also be reduced in parts of the country where base material is scarce by temporarily providing roads with a thickness of 4 to 6 inches of gravel-sand-clay mix, whose failures under traffic can be repaired in the process of maintenance by <b>motor</b> <b>blades.</b> American practice, interpreted with an eye to the greater average age of motor vehicles in Turkey, indicates that maximum grades should be limited to 6 % with 7 % used on short sections of very mountainous terrain.

The traffic contemplated by 1970 does not justify grade separation structures on rural highways. Such structures, however, will be needed at railroad crossings, and the beginning made toward their construction must be followed by increased work in that direction.

40|$|Background: Wind {{turbines}} are a form {{of renewable}} energy, which generate electricity from wind energy, a practice dating back over 100 years. More recently, large-scale wind energy developments have started to employ one or several industrial wind turbines, which produce the majority of wind energy in Ontario. The production of electricity from the movement of industrial wind turbine <b>motor</b> <b>blades</b> creates both mechanical and aerodynamic noise. This type of environmental noise is a growing public health concern, especially for residents living close to industrial wind turbines. A body of evidence now exists to suggest that industrial wind turbine noise can impair health and contribute to annoyance and sleep disturbance. However, in Ontario, {{little is known about}} how industrial wind turbines impact people living in their vicinity. Objectives: This investigation was a cross-sectional study involving eight Ontario communities that contain greater than ten industrial wind turbines. The objectives of this study were to explore the association between proximity to industrial wind turbines and self-reported health effects, specifically quality of life (both physical and mental health) and sleep disturbance, in residents living close to wind turbines. Dose-response relationships were also explored in an attempt to investigate acceptable exposure levels and appropriate setback distances for industrial wind turbines. Methods: Eight wind farms in Ontario were selected for analysis. For this cross-sectional study, the ‘Quality of Life and Renewable Energy Technologies Study’ survey was used to measure the impact of industrial wind turbines on health. Using Canada Post’s Unaddressed Admail Service, surveys were sent to 4, 876 residences near industrial wind turbines in these eight communities. Survey responses were sent back to the University of Waterloo and data from the surveys were used for analysis. Descriptive analyses were performed and multiple regression models were run to investigate the effect of the main independent variable of interest (distance to nearest industrial wind turbine) on the various outcome variables. Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations were performed on a number of dependent and independent variables including age, sex, time in home, number of industrial wind turbines within 2, 000 meters and sleep and health outcomes. Results: In total, 412 surveys were returned (8. 45 % response rate); 16 of these survey respondents did not provide their home address. Therefore, 396 surveys were included in the analysis. The mean self-reported distances of survey respondents to wind farms was 2, 782 meters +- 3, 950 meters (range: 0. 40 - 55, 000 meters). The mean calculated distance from residence to the closest industrial wind turbine was 4, 523 meters +- 4, 420 meters (range: 316 - 22, 661 meters). The difference between the calculated and perceived distance measurements was statistically significant (P< 0. 001) with survey respondents reporting that they live, on average, 1, 741 meters closer to wind farms than they actually do. The relationship between Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and ln(distance) was found to be statistically significant (P= 0. 01) when controlling for age, gender and county, meaning that as distance increased (move further away from an industrial wind turbine), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index decreased (i. e. sleep improved) in a logarithmic relationship. Among the eight Wind Turbine Syndrome index variables, the relationship between vertigo and ln(distance) was statistically significant (P< 0. 001) when controlling for age, gender, and county. Additionally, the relationship between tinnitus and ln(distance) approached statistical significance (P= 0. 08) when controlling for age, gender and county. Both vertigo and tinnitus were worse among participants living closer to industrial wind turbines. Conclusion: Study findings suggest that industrial wind turbines could have an impact on health. Using a sample of rural Ontario residents (although not necessarily representative of the target population), this study explored the quality of life (both physical and mental health) and sleep disturbance of residents living in the vicinity of industrial wind turbines. However, because of study limitations, there are many questions still to be answered before firm conclusions can be drawn. Based on {{the findings of this study}} it is recommended that further studies be carried out to examine the effects of low-level stressors, such as industrial wind turbine noise, on health. Specifically, study findings suggest that future research should focus on the effects of industrial wind turbine noise on sleep disturbance and symptoms of inner ear problems. Although the study findings could suggest that there is a possible association between various health outcomes and how far someone lives from an industrial wind turbine, it is important to remember that there are limitations to these conclusions...|$|R
