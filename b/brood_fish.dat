50|$|The walking catfish was {{imported}} to Florida, reportedly from Thailand, in {{the early}} 1960s for the aquaculture trade. The first introductions apparently occurred in the mid-1960s when adult fish imported as brood stock escaped, either from a fish farm in northeastern Broward County or from a truck transporting <b>brood</b> <b>fish</b> between Dade and Broward Counties. Additional introductions in Florida, supposedly purposeful releases, were made by fish farmers in the Tampa Bay area, Hillsborough County in late 1967 or early 1968, after the state banned the importation and possession of walking catfish. Aquarium releases likely are responsible for introductions in other states. Dill and Cordone (1997) reported this species has been sold by tropical fish dealers in California for some time. They have also been spotted occasionally in the Midwest.|$|E
50|$|Produced in hatcheries, {{the most}} common {{hybridization}} is the female striped bass Morone saxatilis and the male white bass M. chrysops. This {{is due to the}} high number of eggs produced by the female striped bass. This hybrid cross, palmetto bass, typically produces a faster-growing offspring which attains larger size than the sunshine bass. The female striped bass is injected with human gonadotropin which stimulates her to lay. Usually, around a dozen male white bass are in the tank when the spawn occurs. Once the eggs are fertilized, the <b>brood</b> <b>fish</b> are removed and the eggs must stay adrift in artificial current for about 48 hours to hatch. Natural hybridization occurs between the species, but it is usually the reverse cross which would be male M. saxatilis x female M. chrysops, since the white bass eggs do not require the same degree of flotation to hatch.|$|E
50|$|Showa were {{originally}} developed by Jukichi Hoshino about 1927. He paired a Kohaku and a Ki-Utsuri. These early Showas had a greyish shiro and striped fins. The sumi (black) was dull and the hi was weak. Later, Showa were bred to Asagi which helped produce the black motoguro markings in the fins. However, the hi was still weak and pale. In 1964 Tomiji Kobayashi crossed a male Kohaku {{with a female}} Showa to produce a new style Showa with a large crimson red pattern. It also had a brighter white ground without netting. However, the Kobayashi Showa still suffered from small size and poor body shape.

At {{the end of the}} feeding trial, the <b>brood</b> <b>fish</b> were induced to breed with PG extract to observe the effect of vitamin Eon feed. After rearing for 90 days with the experimental feeds, it was found that weight gain and specific growth rate of <b>brood</b> <b>fish</b> fed with 100 mg vitamin E/kg feed (treatment T 3) was the highest (14. 78 ± 0. 38 g and 2. 99 ± 0. 11) while 150 mg vitamin E/kg feed (treatment T 4) fed fish gave the poorest result (2. 97 ± 0. 89 g and 1. 21 ± 0. 32). There {{was no significant difference in}} terms of length gain of <b>brood</b> <b>fish</b> among the different treatments. The <b>brood</b> <b>fish</b> were induced to breed with equal dose of PG extract (18 and 12 mg PG/kg body weight for female and male respectively) to observe the dietary effect of vitamin E on breeding performance. The highest ovulation, fertilization and hatching rate of eggs were found to be 81. 48 ± 6. 41 %, 84. 04 ± 3. 53 % and 68. 59 ± 5. 03 % respectively in the <b>brood</b> <b>fish</b> of treatment T 1 while the poorest (33. 33 ± 00 %, 52. 35 ± 5. 02 % and 45. 70 ± 7. 24 % respectively) were found in the <b>brood</b> <b>fish</b> under treatment T 4.

40|$|The {{ability to}} expand within the {{aquaculture}} industry is essentially based on reliable production of healthy juvenile fish. In 2013 a new aquareovirus {{was found to}} be associated with high juvenile mortality at a Norwegian Atlantic halibut production site, but the source of the virus was not identified. Feed and water intake had been tested with negative results. The aim {{of this study is to}} test the halibut <b>brood</b> <b>fish</b> as a possible source for the virus. The <b>brood</b> <b>fish</b> are stripped several times during their life time which means that it is necessary to develop non- lethal sampling methods for screening with respect to presence of virus. The Atlantic halibut reovirus (AHRV) is known to replicate in the liver and pancreas tissues of the halibut and large amounts of virus have also been detected in the kidneys. This means that shedding of the virus through faeces or urine could contaminate the eggs during stripping. A method of anal swabbing was developed for testing of faeces and urine for presence of the AHR virus. In addition, eggs and milt from each batch liberated from the <b>brood</b> <b>fish</b> were tested for presence of the virus. Halibut larvae produced during the study period suffered a disease outbreak associated with both AHR virus and Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV). The IPN virus is also known to replicate in liver, pancreas and kidney of the halibut, which mean that the same approach for identifying possible virus positive <b>brood</b> <b>fish</b> could be used for both viruses. The ovary fluid from a female halibut tested positive for AHRV and IPNV and the tanks containing larvae hatched from eggs from this female suffered high mortalities.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Bateman {{demonstrated}} {{differences in}} variance for fertility and mating success between the sexes, with males usually having a greater variance than females. Thus in general, male reproductive success increases with number of mates acquired. These {{results have been}} referred to as ‘‘Bateman’s principles’’ and taken together with other parameters (e. g., relative parental investment) have been proposed to estimate a component of sexual selection. For this review I examine patterns of parental care and sexual selection in teleost <b>fishes</b> (substrate <b>brooding</b> and with internal fertilization). I present data for the pumpkinseed sunfish Lepomis gibbosus, in which I estimated cost of paternal care and compared direct measures of the intensity of selection on possible sexually selected traits to measures of sexual selection based on Bateman’s principles. Despite high levels of paternal care in substrate <b>brooding</b> <b>fishes,</b> sexual selection tends to act more strongly on males than on females, which suggests that maternal investment is higher than paternal investment and that parental care does not limit the reproductive rate for males. In pumpkinseed sunfish, selection favors parents with high levels of defense that may exclude predators more effectively and, as suggested by Bate-man’s measures, alternative reproductive strategies may decrease the opportunity for sexual selection within the parental strategy. In teleost fishes with internal fertilization, patterns of parental investment and intensity of sexual selection seem to support Bateman’s principles, but further studies using these systems and these measures of selection will improve the understanding of factors affecting the intensity of sexual selection and its relation to mating systems...|$|R

Several studies reported that there is shortage of quality Clariid brood stock in Nigeria. But there is no study which quantified the brood stock production status in Nigeria. This {{study was conducted in}} Makurdi, the capital of Benue state. The state is ranked among top to ten aquaculture producing states in Nigeria. A well structure questionnaire was designed and used for the study, as the instrument for data collection. This instrument was subjected to content validity. A total of 46 fish farms were purposively sampled. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. The study found that only 11 % fish farms in Makurdi Nigeria produce Clariid <b>brood</b> <b>fish</b> with an estimated production of 945 stocks per annum, while 89 % of farms do not produce fish brood stock. Gross shortage of <b>brood</b> <b>fish</b> was reported by 88. 64 % of fish farmers. Although 59. 09 % of the studied population source fingerlings from hatcheries, 40. 91 % still relies on wild stock, particular from River Benue. Revealed constraints to brood stock production were: Poor knowledge and techniques for rearing brood stock, the long period of keeping fish to attain sexual maturity, which discourage most farmers, and lack of suitable culture facilities for <b>brood</b> <b>fish.</b> The most cultured species were Clarias sp., (50. 00 %), and Heterobranchus sp., (22. 75 %). Heteroclarias hybrid and Oreochromis niloticus had 13. 64 % and 11. 36 % culture respectively. The categories of fish farms observed in the study area from: Large scale, Medium scale, Small scale and Subsistence level had 13. 64 %, 40. 91 %, 29. 55 % and 15. 91 % respectively. The study also found that 45. 45 % of the respondents had 4 - 6 years fish farming experience, 18. 18 % had 1 - 3 years’ experience, 13. 64 % had 7 - 9 years’ experience, while 11. 36 % had 10 years and above experience, same with few new entrants.

The work on raising young-of-the-year European grayling was carried out in 2014 at the fish hatchery “Lopushno”, Chernivtsi region, during five months (May – September). YOY were obtained from 22 age- 3 – 4 <b>brood</b> <b>fish,</b> which were kept in ponds of the natural reserve “Synevir”. Culture-biological parameters of <b>brood</b> <b>fish</b> were determined based on Pravdin (1966) method for salmonids. To avoid traumatization of fish, they were kept in the anesthetic “Propiscin” before the collection of sexual products. The condition factor was determined by Fulton’s formula. Findings. The mean weight of <b>brood</b> <b>fish</b> used for spawning was 110 g with the mean body length of 22 cm. Fulton’s condition factor of European grayling was: 1. 1 in females and 1. 0 in males. Feeding of larvae was as follows: starting feeds — live feeds (Cyclops, Moina), then the alternation of live feeds and a specialized starting feed for 30 days, and the artificial feed after. Raising European grayling from larvae to young-of-the-year was carried out in trays of different sizes from 0. 5 m 2 to 4. 5 m 2, water level in trays was increased according to fish growth from 20 cm to 42 cm. Water supply was 60 L/min, thus the rate of water exchange was from 0. 5 to 1. 7 times/hour that corresponded to technical norms for salmonids. Mean weight of the young-of-the-year on September 10 was 17. 1 g, mean length was 11. 8 cm. Originality. Consists in the comprehensive assessment and development of an integral mechanism of scientific principles and methodical recommendations on artificial reproduction of European grayling. Practical value. The results of the work will be used for the works on the reproduction of valuable fish species in aquaculture facilities of the Carpathian region...|$|E
40|$|We used a {{field survey}} and a {{laboratory}} rearing experiment to (a) examine response (size and survival) to life-long hypoxia in offspring of the African maternal mouth-brooding cichlid Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor victoriae (Seegers) and (b) explore {{the degree to}} which developmental response can be environmentally-induced. Embryo size metrics were quantified in 9 field populations across a range of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. In the laboratory, first generation (F 1) broods of low-DO origin were reared under high or low DO. Brooding period was quantified for the mothers; and egg size, egg metabolic rate and juvenile size-at-release were quantified in their (F 2) offspring. The F 2 offspring were split and grown for 3 months post-release under high or low DO, and juvenile size and survival were quantified. In the field survey, across stages, embryos from low-DO field populations were shorter and weighed less than embryos from high-DO populations. In the laboratory experiment, F 2 eggs and juveniles-at-release from mother’s mouth did not differ in mass, length, survival regardless of development DO environment. However, juveniles diverged in size after leaving mother’s mouth, exhibiting smaller size when grown under low DO. Size differences in embryo size across field populations and divergence in embryo size after release from the mother’s mouth support predictions for smaller body size under hypoxia. There was no evidence for negative effects on survival of juveniles after 3 months. Brooding period was 16 % shorter in females reared under low DO suggesting that hypoxia may accelerate embryo development. This work provides insights into how bearer fishes respond to hypoxic stress relative to fishes with no post-spawning parental care; a shorter brooding interval and smaller body size may provide an optimal solution to parent and embryo survival under hypoxia in <b>brooding</b> <b>fishes</b> [Current Zoology 58 (3) : 401 - 412, 2012]...|$|R
40|$|Fish {{presence}} in experimentally simulated temperature conditions (limno-towers) led to diel vertical migration {{and resulted in}} a decrease of ephippia production in Daphnia pulicaria. Diel fluctuation of food, temperature and day length similar to those experi-enced by migrating Daphnia were tested in laboratory experiments with flow-through-systems. Daphnids were kept under these con-ditions for 15 days and the proportions of females producing an ephippium were determined. In addition, maturation time, survival to maturation, size of the first clutch and female dry weight (without eggs) on day 15 were traced. The most important factor affect-ing ephippia production in migrating Daphnia was photoperiod change, and when mother and embryo are exposed to alternating light conditions, these {{are thought to have}} the effect on the mother of acting as a signal to stop ephippia production. Such effects might be explained by the different sensitiveness to light intensity in females carrying an embryo and an embryo itself in <b>broods.</b> <b>Fish</b> presence forced Daphnia to stay in low-light conditions during daytime hours, to avoid attacks by fish. The Daphnia were able to check light intensity constantly by short vertical jumps above a light-threshold that was confirmed experimentally in limno-towers. The dim conditions were possibly light enough for adults to check day length, but were too dark for embryos shaded by the mother's body. Food conditions played a relatively small role in the process, and no effects of temperature on ephippia production were found. As expected, food affected the size of the first clutch, and temperature controlled the time to maturation. Photoperiod had a marginally significant influence on the time to maturation in Daphnia. A hypothesis on the role of photoperiod as the key factor for Daphnia life cyclic recurrence and other seasonal adaptations is proposed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{study of the}} {{artificial}} propagation efficiency in white fish (Coregonus lavaretus) and its fingerlings producing in IRAN, a 9 mounts study project was been done which during it, {{the characteristics of the}} matures and <b>brood</b> stocks <b>fishes,</b> the condition of their natural and artificial propagation, and the characteristics of produced frys, were been studied. Throughout the total 82 pieces caught fishes during September til February 2003, 10 pieces of them were the female brood stocks which during the catch time did not have spouse. The study of these fishes showed that there was no significant correlation between their weight and their length. The most and the least absolute fecundity of these brood stocks were 19120 and 11496 respectively. The artificial propagation was been done by 5 males and 4 females broods took which 57602 ova, with 89 / 2...|$|R
