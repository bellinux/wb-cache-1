50|$|Modern-day paste {{contains}} carbon black, <b>blanc</b> <b>fixe</b> (barium sulfate) and lignosulfonate. The <b>blanc</b> <b>fixe</b> {{acts as a}} {{seed crystal}} for the lead-to-lead sulfate reaction. The <b>blanc</b> <b>fixe</b> must be fully dispersed in the paste in order {{for it to be}} effective. The lignosulfonate prevents the negative plate from forming a solid mass during the discharge cycle, instead enabling the formation of long needle-like dendrites. The long crystals have more surface area and are easily converted back to the original state on charging. Carbon black counteracts the effect of inhibiting formation caused by the lignosulfonates. Sulfonated naphthalene condensate dispersant is a more effective expander than lignosulfonate and speeds up formation. This dispersant improves dispersion of barium sulfate in the paste, reduces hydroset time, produces a more breakage-resistant plate, reduces fine lead particles and thereby improves handling and pasting characteristics. It extends battery life by increasing end-of-charge voltage. Sulfonated naphthalene requires about one-third to one-half the amount of lignosulfonate and is stable to higher temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Pigments can be {{classified}} as either natural or synthetic. Natural pigments include various clays, calcium carbonate, mica, silicas, and talcs. Synthetics would include engineered molecules, calcined clays, <b>blanc</b> <b>fixe,</b> precipitated calcium carbonate, and synthetic pyrogenic silicas.|$|E
30|$|The {{presence}} of barium and absence {{of lead in}} these samples is notable. It suggests that Bauer likely used barium white (barium sulphate, barytes, <b>blanc</b> <b>fixe,</b> constant white, permanent white) {{as a replacement for}} lead white or as a transparent extender for his coloured pigments. Rejected by oil painters due to its lack of opacity in oil, barium white found favour with watercolourists {{in the late eighteenth century}} [24]. It is notable that James Sowerby, the London engraver who printed Bauer’s paintings for the published Flora Graeca lists it in his book on colours in 1809 [39]. Indeed, the use of barium white remain almost entirely limited to watercolour until the 1820 s, when it began to be used as an adulterant in the production of lead white [40]. Harley [24] notes that barium white was first described as an artists’ pigment by Scheele in 1775, although it was certainly in use sporadically since the sixteenth century.|$|E
