5|$|Alan Tudyk had {{the idea}} for an episode about a planet that is always day on one side, and night on the other. On the night side, Jayne accidentally spills a type of {{pheromone}} on himself and the crew, which attracts a species of dogs. The crew are chased <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> by these dogs. There River uses her mind powers to domesticate the dogs.|$|E
5|$|The Vought OS2U Kingfisher was {{a lightly}} armed two-man {{aircraft}} designed in 1937. The Kingfisher's high operating ceiling of 13,000 feet (nearly four kilometers) made it well-suited for its primary mission: {{to observe the}} fall of shot from a battleship's guns and radio corrections <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> The floatplanes used in World War II also performed search and rescue for naval aviators who were shot down or forced to ditch in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Picard pilots {{the shuttle}} {{through the field}} of {{distortion}} pockets. Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) transports the Captain <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> before the shuttle is destroyed. The approach resulted in the Enterprise nearing {{the edge of the}} nebula, and they quickly depart. Afterwards, D'Sora reveals to Data over a romantic dinner in his quarters that she broke up with her boyfriend because he was emotionally unavailable and then pursued him because he was the same. Data realises that she is breaking up with him and explains that he will delete the subroutine. D'Sora departs and Data blows out the candles seemingly unperturbed.|$|E

60|$|And there, indeed, {{went the}} piraguas {{on their way}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships.</b> But now it was {{observed}} that they were empty, save for the men who rowed them. Their armed cargo had been left ashore.|$|R
5|$|The Malagasy on the ship, {{seeing the}} signal fires, cut the anchor cable, {{allowing}} Meermin to drift shorewards, where she grounded on a sandbank. Crew member Rijk Meyer, who had earlier been thrown overboard and swum around {{the ship to}} the safety of the gunroom, now swam from the ship to the shore and was brought to Le Sueur. He informed Le Sueur that the Malagasy on the ship had told him to find out whether the earlier landing party was there, but that he had secretly arranged with the other crew members that, if help was available on shore, he would signal <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> by waving a handkerchief above his head. Six Malagasy and another crew member also left Meermin in a canoe, but a unit of the militia immediately surrounded the party when they landed. One Malagasy was shot dead and three others taken prisoner; the dead Malagasy was later identified by one of the ship's crew as the mutiny's overall ringleader, but his name was not recorded. Of the remaining two, one swam away and the other was believed either to have swum <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> or drowned in the attempt. Enraged by the crew's deception, the Malagasy still on Meermin launched an attack on the crew which lasted for three hours, but the crew were able to defend themselves.|$|E
5|$|As the {{simulation}} begins to weaken under the Saints' influence, Zinyak floods virtual Steelport with copies of gang members the Boss has faced in the past. Kinzie determines that the copies {{are being made}} from someone's memory, leading the Boss to conclude Johnny Gat, who was seemingly killed during the events of Saints Row: The Third, is still alive and trapped within {{the simulation}}. Despite protests from Kinzie and Matt that rescuing Johnny will reveal their location to Zinyak, the Boss rescues Johnny from his nightmare of Aisha's death and gets him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> Johnny explains that during the fight {{in which he was}} presumed killed, he was actually abducted by Zinyak years in advance of their invasion, as Zinyak had concluded that Johnny could have single-handedly stopped him if left on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Droits de l'Homme was irreparably damaged, {{and many}} of the men on board were {{soldiers}} with no training for what to do {{in the event of a}} shipwreck. Each successive wave swept more men into the water and desperate attempts to launch boats failed when the small craft were swept away by the waves and broken in the surf. Rafts were constructed, but several were swamped in attempts to carry a rope to the shore. The men on the one raft that remained upright were forced to cut the rope to prevent them from foundering in the heavy seas. Some of the men on this raft reached the beach, the first survivors of the wreck. Subsequent attempts were made by individuals to swim to shore with ropes, but they were either drowned or driven <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> by the force of the sea.|$|E
50|$|On 15 August 2012, activists from Hong Kong sailed to, {{and landed}} {{on one of the}} disputed islands, but were stopped by the Japan Coast Guard. Seven activists jumped from <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> <b>to</b> swim ashore, five of whom reached the island; the other two turned <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships.</b> <b>The</b> activists and their ship were {{detained}} by Japanese authorities. The detained activists were deported two days later.|$|R
5|$|Ford, {{serving as}} General Quarters Officer of the Deck, {{was ordered to}} go below <b>to</b> assess <b>the</b> raging fire.

5|$|During the Philippine–American War, Yorktown {{stood in}} to Baler Bay, {{on the west}} coast of Luzon, on 11 April 1899, on a mission to relieve a Spanish {{garrison}} that had been under siege by Filipino troops for nine months. Lt. James C. Gillmore and a party of sailors in the ship's whaleboat provided a decoy, ostensibly taking soundings of a nearby river. Meanwhile, Standley and an enlisted man landed farther up the coast to reconnoiter. The next day, Gillmore and his boat crew drifted into a trap, running aground too far from the river's mouth and out of sight of Yorktown. Filipino troops, hidden in the jungle-covered banks, raked the boat with rifle fire. Two American sailors were killed; two were mortally wounded; and the remainder, including Gillmore, were slightly wounded. The survivors were taken prisoner until freed by U.S. Army troops. Standley completed his mission and, together with the enlisted signalman, made it <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
5|$|Realizing his foolishness, Sybok sacrifices {{himself in}} an effort to combat the {{creature}} and allow the others to escape. Intent on stopping the being, Kirk orders the Enterprise to fire a photon torpedo at their location, to little effect. Spock and McCoy are beamed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> but Klaa's vessel attacks the Enterprise before Kirk can be transported aboard. The vengeful entity reappears and tries to kill Kirk when Klaa's vessel destroys it in a hail of fire. Kirk is beamed aboard the Klingon ship, where Spock and the Klingon General Korrd force Klaa to stand down. The Enterprise and Klingon crews celebrate a new détente, and Kirk, Spock, and McCoy resume their vacation at Yosemite.|$|E
25|$|During the expedition, Gibbs helped catch Adelie {{penguins}} for the Smithsonian Institution. This {{was dangerous}} work because {{the men had}} to work from a rowboat in fog with a non-working radio. Only the sounding of the ship's horn gave the men bearings {{to find their way}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of April 23, a group of 100 Norwegian {{soldiers}} {{under the command of}} First Lieutenant Jochum Nicolay Müller, also managed to get ashore south of Sponvigen. From there they marched inland and captured 11 Swedish soldiers and 6 corporals, and confiscated some military equipment, before heading <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships.</b>|$|R

25|$|During {{the night}} of 14/15 April, a diversionary landing was planned near Baracoa, Oriente Province, by about 164 Cuban exiles {{commanded}} by Higinio 'Nino' Diaz. Their mother ship, named La Playa or Santa Ana, had sailed from Key West under a Costa Rican ensign. Several US Navy destroyers were stationed offshore near Guantánamo Bay to {{give the appearance of}} an impending invasion fleet. The reconnaissance boats turned <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> after their crews detected activities by Cuban militia forces along the coastline.|$|E
25|$|Eggman {{activates}} Gamma, who defeats Beta {{in training}} and accompanies the E-Series robots to search for Froggy, who has eaten Chaos's tail and a Chaos Emerald. Gamma finds Froggy but is chased <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> by Froggy's friend Big. Reminiscing about her time with Sonic, Amy discovers a Flicky {{in possession of a}} Chaos Emerald, naming it Birdie. Zero captures Amy and Birdie and detains them on the Egg Carrier. Tails arrives in the Tornado II, powered by another Emerald, and he and Sonic give chase. Knuckles boards the aircraft after seeing a vision of the Egg Carrier in the Master Emerald.|$|E

25|$|IDW Comics {{took the}} {{character}} {{in a different direction}} in its licensed works. In the official comic book prequel to the 2009 movie Star Trek, Worf is a General in the Klingon Empire who is dispatched to deal with Romulan Captain Nero and his significantly altered mining vessel, the Narada. When the Klingon forces suffer a crushing defeat, Worf agrees to Nero's demand to board a shuttle and come on board the Narada. Worf takes the opportunity to surprise Nero, cutting into the Narada's hull and fighting his way to the main bridge for a confrontation with Nero. Already prepared for such a tactic, Nero succeeds in surprising Worf by impaling him through the back with a large mechanical tentacle. When the Enterprise-E arrives to do battle with the Narada, Nero agrees to beam Worf over if the ship will lower its shields. When Captain Data agrees, Worf is beamed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> giving the Narada time to fire on the Enterprise. The ship suffers heavy damage, but manages to raise its shields in time to prevent a second attack. Nero then leaves the battle to continue his assault on the planet Vulcan. Worf is assumed to have survived, but this is never explicitly mentioned in the comic.|$|E
500|$|The Bounty party {{spent their}} time at Adventure Bay in recuperation, fishing, {{replenishment}} of water casks, and felling timber. There were peaceful {{encounters with the}} native population. The first sign of overt discord between Bligh and his officers occurred when the captain exchanged angry words with William Purcell the carpenter over the latter's methods for cutting wood. Bligh ordered Purcell <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> and, when the carpenter stood his ground, Bligh withheld his rations, which [...] "immediately brought him to his senses", according to Bligh.|$|E
500|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Barclay decided the {{continued}} {{occupation of the}} lighthouse was of marginal value and ordered his men <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> A landing party of 30 sailors from Amphitrite and a similar number of U.S. Marines from the [...] under Lieutenant John A. Lejeune came ashore to secure the area while the 60 Fajardan civilians boarded the Leyden for passage to Ponce and the lighthouse was abandoned to the Spaniards. In Fajardo, Pino's men tore down the U.S. flags that flew over the harbor Customs House and City Hall, returning to San Juan after verifying that the lighthouse was abandoned. The contingent of about 20 civil guards that had accompanied Pino, were left to maintain order in the town. The skirmish at Fajardo {{was the only time}} that American forces withdrew from a position during the Puerto Rican Campaign.|$|E

50|$|Naval Tactical Data System, {{commonly}} known as NTDS, refers to a computerized information processing system developed by the United States Navy in the 1950s and first deployed in the early 1960s for use in combat ships. It took reports from multiple sensors on different ships and collated it to produce a single unified map of the battlespace. This information could then be relayed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> weapons operators.|$|R
2500|$|Prince Henry {{realized}} the Portuguese were hopelessy outnumbered, that the siege was lost {{and the best}} they could do was to fight an orderly rearguard action <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships.</b> [...] All <b>the</b> seamen were ordered to prepare sail, while the army was arrayed to defend a retreat of <b>the</b> assault force <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fortified siege camp lines. The marshal Coutinho was given command of the artillery, the admiral Almada would take the infantry, while Henry himself took command of the cavalry.|$|R
500|$|Whatever the unmentioned plan was, an {{expedition}} to try for the Pole was dispatched on June 6, 1872. Chester led the expedition in a whaleboat, but this was crushed by the ice within {{a few miles of}} Polaris. Chester and his men hiked <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> and persuaded Budington to give them the collapsible boat. With this, and Tyson piloting another whaleboat, the men set northward again. In the meantime, the Polaris had found open water, and was searching for a route south. Budington, not eager to spend another winter in the ice, sent Ebierbing north with orders for the Tyson and Chester: return to the ship at once. The men were forced to abandon both craft and walk [...] back to Polaris. Now three of the ship's precious lifeboats were lost, and a fourth (the small scow) would be crushed by ice in July after being carelessly left out overnight. The expedition had failed in its main objective to reach the North Pole.|$|E
500|$|... "Green" [...] roams the corridors, first {{following}} Yeoman Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney) {{into the}} botanical laboratory as she brings Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu (George Takei) his {{lunch with a}} salt shaker. A plant in the lab shrieks and shrinks in fear {{at the entrance of}} the creature, causing alarm. The creature then moves on, attacking several crew members, killing one. It then shape-shifts into the form of McCoy. Meanwhile, Spock confirms that scans show only one person, Crater, on the planet; Kirk and Spock beam down to capture him. They find Green's body before Crater tries to frighten them away with phaser fire. After they stun him with a phaser beam, the dazed Crater reveals that his real wife was killed by the creature—the last member of a long-dead civilization of shape-shifters who feed on salt—a year earlier. The creature continues to take on the appearance of Nancy out of affection for Crater, and he has been feeding it. Kirk informs Enterprise of the creature's intrusion, as the away team and Crater transport <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
500|$|On 19 September, with Karluk ice-bound {{and largely}} stationary, Stefansson {{announced}} that {{in view of}} the shortage of fresh meat and the likelihood of a long sojourn in the ice, he would lead a small hunting party that would search for caribou and other game {{in the area of the}} Colville River. He would take with him the two Inuit [...] "Jimmy" [...] and [...] "Jerry", the expedition secretary Burt McConnell, the photographer George Wilkins, and the anthropologist Diamond Jenness. Stefansson expected to be gone for about ten days; Bartlett was instructed by letter that, if the ship should move from its present position, he should [...] "send a party ashore, to erect one or more beacons giving information of the ship's whereabouts." [...] The next day the six men departed. On 23 September, following a blizzard, the ice floe in which Karluk was trapped began to move, and soon the ship was travelling at between [...] a day—but to the west, steadily further from Herschel Island and from Stefansson's party who, it soon became clear, would not be able to find their way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E

It was early evening before boats became available; many of the maimed and bleeding were sent off in filthy barges.|$|R
