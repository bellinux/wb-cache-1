A brutal gunfight ensues which culminates with Doug {{attempting}} to negotiate with Oerstadt but finally catching him off guard and killing him. He gets into the car to try to free Claire but police surround the vehicle and threaten to open fire. To save everyone, Doug and Claire purposely drive the bomb SUV off the end of the ferry before it explodes. Claire escapes but Doug, unable {{to get out of the}} vehicle, dies in the underwater explosion. As Claire mourns Doug's death, she is approached by an identical Doug Carlin, the one from her present, who consoles her.|$|E
5|$|Walter de Lacy {{travelled}} to Ireland in 1201 and {{the following}} year his properties, including Ludlow Castle, were once again confiscated to ensure his loyalty and placed {{under the control of}} William de Braose, his father-in-law. Walter's lands were returned to him, subject to the payment of a fine of 400marks, but in 1207 his disagreements with royal officials in Ireland led to King John seizing the castle and putting it under the control of William again. Walter reconciled himself with John the following year, <b>but</b> <b>meanwhile</b> William himself had fallen out with the King; violence broke out and both Walter and William took refuge in Ireland, with John taking control of Ludlow yet again. It was not until 1215 that their relationship recovered and John agreed to give Ludlow back to Walter. At some point during the early 13th century, the innermost bailey was constructed in the castle, creating an additional private space within the inner bailey.|$|E

25|$|The Undertaker {{then began}} a storyline where he teamed with Big Show in a tag team known as The Unholy Alliance, which held the WWF World Tag Team Championship twice. After their victory at SummerSlam, The Undertaker {{suffered}} a groin tear and was seen limping in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches {{in the following}} weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, {{it would have been}} as Mark Calaway. Although negotiations were described as close, he ultimately re-signed with the World Wrestling Federation. To compensate for his lack of physical action, Undertaker became more vocal on the mic, often making smart-aleck remarks and providing commentary. In September 1999, on SmackDown!, Mr. McMahon threatened that he would remove Undertaker from the Unforgiven main event if he refused to participate in a casket match against Triple H. Undertaker retorted that he did not care and maybe he would not be participating in anything, thus walking out of the WWF. In reality, Calaway went on a hiatus from the WWF in order to treat his groin injury. On December 14 he made his return to action, teaming with Viscera in a losing effort against Kane and The Godfather at a house show in Caomo, Puetro Rico. The Undertaker was advertised on the Armageddon promotional poster to return, <b>but</b> <b>meanwhile</b> also tore his pectoral muscle, making him take almost eight months out of action.|$|E

In her diary, Murasaki wrote about Shōshi's court, [...] " [...] has gathered round her a number of very worthy young ladies...

500|$|The {{number to}} be {{produced}} was subject to [...] fluctuation as the War Office vacillated in their demand; in July 1938, it requested that 70 of the tanks be produced, then increased the request to 120 after a three-day conference in November. Production was to begin in July 1940, <b>but</b> <b>meanwhile</b> the War Office temporarily returned to its original order of 70 before increasing the number to 100. The number further increased to 220 after Metropolitan Cammell Carriage and Wagon, a company part owned by Vickers-Armstrong that would be producing the tanks, indicated it had already ordered armour plating for that many tanks.|$|E
500|$|A stagecoach road existed {{into the}} 19th century that {{passed through the}} {{mountains}} east of San Diego. Construction was discussed as early as 1911, with The San Diego Union and Daily Bee saying that it [...] "will {{be one of the}} best in the system." [...] Well before the freeway was constructed, the automobile road through the mountains east of San Diego was narrow and wound through the mountains; it was officially dedicated in 1912. This trip was known to take up to four hours, and frequently resulted in the radiator boiling over, flat tires, or broken fan belts; recent inclement weather would result in cars becoming mired in the mud. <b>But</b> <b>meanwhile,</b> Colonel Ed Fletcher declared the road a [...] "success", and indicated his belief that a concrete road from San Diego to Yuma would soon follow, responding to criticism that a road from Los Angeles to Brawley should have been built.|$|E
500|$|Riou took {{and passed}} his lieutenant's {{examination}} on 19 October 1780, {{shortly after the}} expedition's return to Britain, and received his promotion on 28 October. His first appointment as lieutenant was to the 14-gun brig-sloop , which was sent {{to serve in the}} West Indies. Here Riou appears to have become ill, a common experience for naval officers serving in the tropics, but he survived to return to Britain and was discharged from his ship on 3 February 1782 and went into the Royal Naval Hospital at Haslar. He recovered his health and by April 1783 was back on active service, joining the Portsmouth guardship [...] Discharging from the Ganges in June 1784, he went on to half-pay, which lasted for two years until he received another appointment, this time to the 50-gun [...] in March 1786. The Salisbury was the flagship of Rear-Admiral John Elliot, who sailed to Newfoundland take up his post as Commodore-Governor there. During this period in his life, Riou was described by a seaman aboard the Ganges as 'a strict disciplinarian with a fanatical regard for cleanliness'. He was also noted to be a religious man, and an affectionate son and brother. A further period on half-pay followed his discharge from the Salisbury in November 1788, <b>but</b> <b>meanwhile</b> he had [...] succeeded in attracting the attention of the Townsend family, and was able to use their patronage to secure an appointment to command , in April 1789.|$|E

2500|$|Like the vegetation, Amrum's wild beasts are {{determined}} by the island's location within the North Sea. Thus {{there are only a few}} species of wild mammals on Amrum, like hare, mice, hedgehogs and bats. In the 12th century coneys were introduced as game. Still today they populate the island. A few years ago a pregnant vixen was set free on Amrum. She and her offspring caused severe damage to the island's fauna, <b>but</b> <b>meanwhile</b> they have been hunted down. In the sea and on the sand bars off Amrum, thus within the National Park, harbour seals, grey seals and harbour porpoises have their habitat. Occasionally in December and January young grey seals are washed ashore on Amrum's beaches due to storm surges and are thereafter nursed by the adults.

2500|$|I shall {{investigate}} the following case mathematically. A population is in equilibrium under selection and mutation. One or more genes are rare because their appearance by mutation is balanced by natural selection. A sudden change {{occurs in the}} environment, for example, pollution by smoke, a change of climate, {{the introduction of a}} new food source, predator, or pathogen, and above all migration to a new habitat. It will be shown later that the general conclusions are not affected if the change is slow. The species is less adapted to the new environment, and its reproductive capacity is lowered. It is gradually improved as a result of natural selection. <b>But</b> <b>meanwhile,</b> a number of deaths, or their equivalents in lowered fertility, have occurred.
