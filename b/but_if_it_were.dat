25|$|President Kennedy had {{submitted}} a civil-rights bill to Congress in June 1963, which {{was met with}} strong opposition. Johnson renewed the effort and asked Bobby Kennedy to spearhead the undertaking for the administration on Capitol Hill. This provided adequate political cover for Johnson should the effort fail; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> successful, Johnson would receive ample credit. Historian Robert Caro notes that the bill Kennedy had submitted was facing the same tactics that prevented the passage of civil rights bills in the past; southern congressmen and senators used congressional procedure {{to prevent it from}} coming to a vote. In particular, they held up all of the major bills Kennedy had proposed and that were considered urgent, especially the tax reform bill, in order to force the bill's supporters to pull it.|$|E
25|$|The first {{definite}} {{mention of}} cricket {{in connection with}} the county is a highly controversial match in 1724 between Chingford and Edwin Stead's XI, which is recorded in The Dawn of Cricket by H. T. Waghorn. The venue is unknown <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> at Chingford, it is also the earliest reference to cricket being played in Essex as well as by an Essex team. The game echoed an earlier one in 1718 as the Chingford team refused to play to a finish when Stead's team had the advantage. A court case followed and, as in 1718, it was ordered to be played out presumably so that all wagers could be fulfilled. Lord Chief Justice Pratt presided over the case and he ordered them to play it out on Dartford Brent, though it is not known if this was the original venue. The game was completed in 1726.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of states have yet to determine the applicability of the trespass to chattels theory, the courts that have addressed the issue have applied Intel and required that the plaintiff demonstrate damage to the computer system. A supreme court in New York in School of Visual Arts v. Kuprewicz denied the defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on the trespass to chattels claim because the plaintiff had alleged actual damage to the functionality of the computer system, which Intel requires; the defendant had sent enough e-mails that it reduced the computer system's functionality and drained the hard drive's memory. The Fourth Circuit in Omega World Travel v. Mummagraphics, Inc. also followed Intel, although this resulted in granting a motion for summary judgment for the defendant because the plaintiff did not allege any actual damage on its computer system. The court clarified that Oklahoma courts have yet to recognize the validity of a trespass to chattels claim based on an electronic intrusion to a computer system, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> to recognize it, the plaintiff would need to allege more than nominal damages, which in this case it had not.|$|E

2500|$|The heraldic scholar A. C. Fox-Davies {{proposed}} that, in some circumstances, white {{should be}} considered a heraldic colour, distinct from argent. [...] In a number of instances, a label or collar blazoned as [...] "white" [...] rather than [...] "argent" [...] appears on a supporter blazoned argent or or. [...] The use of [...] "white" [...] in place of [...] "argent" [...] would be consistent with the practice of heraldic blazon that discourages repeating the name of a tincture in describing a coat of arms, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> merely intended as a synonym of [...] "argent", this placement would clearly violate the rule against placing metal on metal or colour on colour (see below). [...] This difficulty is avoided if [...] "white" [...] is considered a colour in this particular instance, rather than a synonym of [...] "argent". [...] This interpretation has neither been accepted nor refuted by any heraldic authority, but a counter-argument is that the labels are not intended to represent a heraldic tincture, but are in fact white labels proper.|$|E
