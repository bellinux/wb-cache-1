He played {{the first half of}} a 2–1 defeat in a friendly match against Slovenia U21. After Leroy Fer and Dirk Marcellis were requisitioned for the senior squad in August 2010, Kieftenbeld received his first under-21 call-up, and made his debut as a second-half substitute in a 2011 European Championship qualifier against Liechtenstein, He also played against Spain in September with the group already won: taking the field after 66 minutes, he was sent off 12 minutes later for a foul on Ander Herrera. He {{made his first}} start for the under-21s in a friendly against Denmark in November 2010, playing at right back in a 3–1 win; his through <b>ball</b> <b>set</b> up Bas Dost for the third goal. He played in two more U21 friendlies, against the Czech Republic and Germany, and was an unused substitute in four Euro 2013 qualifiers in 2011 and 2012. His last international appearances were at the 2012 Toulon Tournament, at which the Netherlands were represented by the Beloftenelftal; he played in four of their five matches.|$|E
25|$|Briggs was a notably {{short man}} at {{about five feet}} five or 165 centimetres. Briggs's skill lay {{in his ability to}} vary the flight and pace of the ball as well as in {{achieving}} prodigious spin on the primitive pitches of the nineteenth century. As a batsman, Briggs was capable of hitting very effectively, but as time went by an eagerness to punish every <b>ball</b> <b>set</b> in and led to a decline.|$|E
25|$|In Canada and the United States, rugby union {{evolved into}} {{gridiron}} football. During the late 1800s (and even the early 1900s), the {{two forms of}} the game were very similar (to {{the point where the}} United States was able to win the gold medal for rugby union at the 1924 Summer Olympics), but numerous rule changes have differentiated the gridiron-based game from its rugby counterpart. Among unique features of the North American game are the separation of play into downs instead of releasing the ball immediately upon tackling, the requirement that the team with the <b>ball</b> <b>set</b> into a set formation for at least one second before resuming play after a tackle (and the allowance of up to 40 seconds to do so), the allowance for one forward pass from behind the site of the last tackle on each down, the evolution of hard plastic equipment (particularly the football helmet and shoulder pads), a smaller and pointier ball that is favorable to being passed but makes drop kicks impractical, a generally smaller and narrower field measured in customary units instead of metric (in some variants of the American game a field can be as short as 50 yards between end zones), and a distinctive field (shaped like a gridiron, from which the code's nickname is derived) with lines marked in five-yard intervals.|$|E

500|$|<b>Ball</b> <b>set</b> a {{new world}} record in the 200-meter breaststroke at the Santa Clara {{invitational}} swim meet in July 1967. [...] At the 1967 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Ball won two individual gold medals in the women's 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke events, and a third in the women's 4×100-meter medley relay in which she swam the breaststroke leg for the winning U.S. team of Kendis Moore, Ball, Ellie Daniel and Wendy Fordyce. [...] In the process, she set new world records in all three events. [...] During 1967, she set world records in all four (two metric, two non-metric) individual breaststroke events as a 15-year-old.|$|E
500|$|Billiards {{historian}} Michael Ian Shamos in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Billiards (1993), citing {{information provided}} by Charles C. Peterson (first president of the Billiard Association of America), and Steve Mizerak and Michael E. Panozzo in Steve Mizerak's Complete Book of Pool (1990), indicate that ascribing the phrase's origin to the game of eight ball results in an anachronism, the phrase being traceable to at least 1919, while the form of game that became [...] "eight-ball" [...] was not described by that name, and its rules were not published in any official rule book, until after 1940. The game that would ultimately be named [...] "eight ball," [...] after a physical 8 ball became part of play, was invented shortly after 1900. That precursor game was little known until it was popularized in 1925 under the name B.B.C. Co. Pool by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company, marketed by them with a special set of balls {{that did not have}} a numbered 8 ball, but rather came with a <b>ball</b> <b>set</b> consisting of seven of one color, seven of another, and an unnumbered black ball. Thus, multiple-time world champion Steve Mizerak explains that behind the eight ball cannot derive from the game of eight ball as [...] "the phrase predates the game... by at least 20 years." ...|$|E

60|$|As {{soon as he}} {{saw that}} this was the case Malchus tore off a strip of his linen shirt, and rolling it into a <b>ball</b> <b>set</b> it on fire. On this he piled up small bones, which caught readily, and he soon had a bright and almost {{smokeless}} fire. He now took the place of Nessus. The latter skinned and cut up one of the small bears, and soon had some steaks broiling over the fire. By this time it was getting dusk without.|$|E

The second time it passed through the centre of the opening. She heard it strike the sound portion of the glass outside, heard it rumble down the roof. A few seconds of breathless silence! Her heart almost stopped beating. Had it rested in some ledge, or fallen into the street below? Then she heard the boy's voice.|$|E

6000|$|... 72. We do not {{altogether}} agree with our author {{in thinking that}} the devils exhibit every variety of horror; we rather fear that the spectator might at first be reminded by them of what {{is commonly known as}} the Dragon pattern of Wedgwood ware. There is invention in them however--and energy; the eyes are always terrible, though simply drawn--a black <b>ball</b> <b>set</b> forward, and two-thirds surrounded by a narrow crescent of white, under a shaggy brow; the mouths are frequently magnificent; that of a demon accompanying a thrust of a spear with a growl, on the right of the picture, is interesting {{as an example of the}} development of the canine teeth noticed by Sir Charles Bell ("Essay on Expression," [...] p. 138)--its capacity of laceration is unlimited: another, snarling like a tiger at an angel who has pulled a soul out of his claws, is equally well conceived; we know nothing like its ferocity except Rembrandt's sketches of wounded wild beasts. The angels we think generally disappointing; they are for the most part diminutive in size, and the crossing of the extremities of the two wings that cover the feet, gives them a coleopterous, cockchafer look, which is not a little undignified; the colors of their plumes are somewhat coarse and dark--one is covered with silky hair, instead of feathers. The souls they contend for are indeed of sweet expression; but exceedingly earthly in contour, the painter being unable to deal with the nude form. On the whole, he seems to have reserved his highest powers for the fresco which follows next in order, the scene of Resurrection and Judgment.|$|E
