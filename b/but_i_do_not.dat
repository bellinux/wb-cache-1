There is a choice of a kind that can only be answered by saying that I stand by the Republic and accordingly I will not oppose this Bill.|$|E

25|$|From {{beyond the}} boundary, it is {{difficult}} to gauge Snow's pace as Lindsay Hassett conceded. He appears to bowl his bumper appreciably faster than most of his fuller-length deliveries, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> believe even his faster bumper knocks {{at the door of the}} pace of bowlers I have named. His top pace, I consider, lies somewhere between that of Statham and Trueman...Snow's loping, almost lazy run, of course, is sinisterly deceptive. It is in that last stride, or last two strides, when that long, straight powerful arm gathers its impetus and either whips or coasts through, that the potential is born.|$|E
25|$|I {{have come}} to the clear {{conclusion}} that there is no basis upon which there should be a further Judicial Inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's Inquiry. There is no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act 1988. I do not consider that there is any material which should be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken. Nor do I consider that there is any justification for setting up any further inquiry into the performance of the emergency and hospital services. I have considered the circumstances in which alterations were made to some of the self-written statements of South Yorkshire Police officers, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> consider that there is any occasion for any further investigation.|$|E

500|$|Bond was {{strongly}} {{opposed to the}} idea that the murderer possessed any kind of scientific or anatomical knowledge, or even [...] "the technical knowledge of a butcher or horse slaughterer". In his opinion, the killer must have been a man of solitary habits, subject to [...] "periodical attacks of homicidal and erotic mania", with the character of the mutilations possibly indicating [...] "satyriasis". Bond also stated that [...] "the homicidal impulse may have developed from a revengeful or brooding condition of the mind, or that religious mania may have been the original disease <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> think either hypothesis is likely".|$|E
500|$|Steinberg {{next came}} up with the idea of showing Oguri moving through two busy Los Angeles intersections. The result is the 11-minute dance film [...] "Xing", which was {{screened}} in 2003 at the Getty Center during Dance Camera West. [...] "Nothing was choreographed beforehand. Oguri does not choreograph, he improvises. But the shots are very specific and the direction is very specific. He knows that he has to get from point A to point B, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> mind how." [...] Steinberg made her first feature-length documentary, Height of Sky, about Oguri, and it was shown on the Sundance Channel in 2008.|$|E

[...] To avoid any {{appearance}} of bias, the Saginaw native noted: [...] "You may think I am a friend of these boys <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know either of them. [...] I hope you change your mind." [...] Gould responded to Miss Grossman in his column: [...] "You may be right, Mary Lee, but it's too late now to change our mind." ...|$|E
500|$|Bohr {{read the}} 19th-century Danish Christian existentialist philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard. Richard Rhodes argued in The Making of the Atomic Bomb that Bohr was {{influenced}} by Kierkegaard through Høffding. In 1909, Bohr sent his brother Kierkegaard's Stages on Life's Way as a birthday gift. In the enclosed letter, Bohr wrote, [...] "It {{is the only thing}} I have to send home; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> believe that it would be very easy to find anything better... I even think {{it is one of the}} most delightful things I have ever read." [...] Bohr enjoyed Kierkegaard's language and literary style, but mentioned that he had some disagreement with Kierkegaard's philosophy. Some of Bohr's biographers suggested that this disagreement stemmed from Kierkegaard's advocacy of Christianity, while Bohr was an atheist.|$|E
500|$|Dworkin's {{short fiction}} and novels often {{incorporated}} elements from {{her life and}} themes from her nonfiction writing, sometimes related by a first-person narrator. Critics have sometimes quoted passages spoken by characters in Ice and Fire as representations of Dworkin's own views. cf. Dworkin, however, wrote [...] "My fiction is not autobiography. I am not an exhibitionist. I do not show myself. I am not asking for forgiveness. I {{do not want to}} confess. But I have used everything I know—my life—to show what I believe must be shown {{so that it can be}} faced. The imperative at the heart of my writing—what must be done—comes directly from my life. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> show my life directly, in full view; nor even look at it while others watch." ...|$|E

[...] Cambridge number six MacLeod said of the Dark Blues: [...] "They kept coming at us time and time again. [...] I was only sure of victory in the last mile of the race." [...] Christopher Dodd, writing in The Guardian was impressed: [...] "The contest had a rare element ... it was a race nearly all the way, and was not all over in the first 20 stokes as has so often {{been the case in}} recent years." [...] Burnell {{suggested}} it was a race for the aficionados: [...] "This was surely one of those so common Boat Races, which are hard fought all the way, yet never exciting {{from the point of view}} of the average spectator." ...|$|E
500|$|Overmars {{was subject}} to {{transfer}} speculation in early 2002 because of his limited role in the first team, but he revealed {{he was happy to}} stay at Barcelona: [...] "My priority now is that the team wins. Personal issues are not important. I'm here for whatever you need me." [...] In the Champions League, he started in the semi-final first leg against Real Madrid; the team lost 2–0 and were defeated 3–1 on aggregate. In May 2002, Rexach was dismissed and replaced by Louis van Gaal, who was managing the club for a second time. Overmars was wary of the appointment beforehand, saying, [...] "Van Gaal is a good manager, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know if his return would be good for Barcelona." [...] He underwent surgery on his right knee {{at the end of the}} season and was out of action for six months.|$|E
500|$|When Higginson {{urged her}} to come to Boston in 1868 so that they could {{formally}} meet for the first time, she declined, writing: [...] "Could it please your convenience to come so far as Amherst I should be very glad, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> cross my Father's ground to any House or town". It was not until he came to Amherst in 1870 that they met. Later he referred to her, in the most detailed and vivid physical account of her on record, as [...] "a little plain woman with two smooth bands of reddish hair ... in a very plain & exquisitely clean white piqué & a blue net worsted shawl." [...] He also felt that he never was [...] "with any one who drained my nerve power so much. Without touching her, she drew from me. I am glad not to live near her." ...|$|E

500|$|At the Coroner's Inquest {{into the}} death of the Princess, on 13 February 2008, {{speaking}} by video-link from France, Tomlinson conceded that, after the interval of 16 or 17 years, he [...] "could not remember specifically" [...] whether the document he had seen during 1992 had in fact proposed the use of a strobe light to cause a traffic accident as a means of assassinating Milošević, although use of lights for this purpose had been covered in his MI6 training. On being told that no MI6 file on Henri Paul had been found, Tomlinson said that it [...] "would be absurd after 17 years to say I can positively disagree with it, <b>but...</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> think the fact that they did not manage to find a file rules out anything either". He said he believed MI6 had an informant at the Paris Ritz but he could not be certain that this person was necessarily Henri Paul.|$|E
500|$|In June 1862, Darwin welcomed {{favourable}} {{reviews in}} the press and wrote to Hooker; [...] "Well my orchis-book is a success (<b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know whether it sells) after cursing my folly in writing it". He told his publisher, [...] "The Botanists praise my Orchid-book to the skies", and to Asa Gray he said, [...] "I am fairly astonished at the success of my book with botanists." [...] Darwin's geologist friend Charles Lyell gave it enthusiastic praise: [...] "next to the Origin, as the most valuable of all Darwin's works." [...] However, the book attracted little attention from the general public, and in September Darwin told his cousin Fox, [...] "Hardly any one not a botanist, except yourself, as far as I know, has cared for it." [...] The book baffled a general public more interested in controversy over gorillas and cavemen. There were some reviews in gardening magazines, but few natural philosophers or zoologists noticed the book, and hardly any learned appraisals appeared.|$|E
500|$|On 15 July 2015, he {{was found}} guilty of being an {{accessory}} to the murder of at least 300,000 Jews. Reacting to the sentence, Auschwitz survivor Eva Mozes Kor said that she was [...] "disappointed" [...] adding: [...] "They are trying to teach a lesson that if you commit such a crime, you will be punished. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> think the court has acted properly in sentencing him to four years in jail. It is too late for that kind of sentence... My preference would have been to sentence him to community service by speaking out against neo-Nazis. I would like the court to prove to me, a survivor, how four years in jail will benefit anybody." [...] Gröning's defence lawyer, Hans Holtermann, was quoted as saying that he would review the verdict before deciding whether to appeal. On 28 November 2016, the appeal was declined by the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH). In August 2017 Oskar Gröning was considered to be fit for prison.|$|E
