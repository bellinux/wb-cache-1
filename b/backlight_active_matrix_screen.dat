5000|$|Prior to the PowerBook 3400c series, {{the names}} of PowerBooks {{reflected}} (among other things) the type of screen they had installed. For example, the PowerBook 1400cs had a passive <b>matrix</b> <b>screen,</b> and the 1400c an <b>active</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>screen.</b> Because all PowerBook 3400c computers came with the same 16-bit color, <b>active</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>screen,</b> the [...] "c" [...] designation {{at the end of}} the PowerBook 3400c name was somewhat superfluous, and is often dropped, even by Apple itself, for example in the user's manual. The internal code name used for the PowerBook 3400c during development was [...] "Hooper", named so after one of the product design engineer's dog.|$|R
5000|$|The main Contura series {{included}} models 3/20, 3/25, 3/25c, 4/25, 4/25c, 4/25cx, 400, 400C, 400CX, 410, 410C, 410CX, 420C, 420CX, 430C, and 430CX. These were mid-size notebooks, not ultra-portable subnotebook computers. The [...] "X" [...] designation denoted an <b>active</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|R
50|$|The PowerBook 180 {{came with}} a 9.5 in (diagonal) <b>active</b> <b>matrix</b> LCD <b>screen,</b> capable of {{displaying}} 4-bit grayscale, and a trackball was mounted beneath the keyboard. A 1.44 MB floppy disk drive and 80 MB 2.5-inch hard drive were also standard.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{portable}} computers which use <b>active</b> <b>matrix</b> LCD <b>screens</b> which did not refresh like CRT monitors and therefore {{could not be used}} for data transfer, in 1997, Timex introduced a notebook adapter that incorporated a red LED and connected with the laptop through the serial port. During download, the LED flashed and the flashing programmed the watch much like the horizontal bars of the CRT.|$|R
5000|$|The Macintosh Portable is Apple Inc.'s first {{battery-powered}} portable Macintosh personal computer. Released on September 20, 1989, it {{was received}} with excitement from most critics but consumer sales were quite low. It featured a fast, sharp, and expensive {{black and white}} <b>active</b> <b>matrix</b> LCD <b>screen</b> in a hinged design that covered the keyboard when the machine was not in use. The Portable {{was one of the}} early consumer laptops to employ an <b>active</b> <b>matrix</b> panel, and only the most expensive of the initial PowerBook line, the PowerBook 170, used one, due to the high cost. The cursor pointing function was handled by a built-in trackball that could be removed and located {{on either side of the}} keyboard. It used expensive SRAM in an effort to maximize battery life and to provide an [...] "instant on" [...] low power sleep mode. The machine was designed to be high-performance, at the cost of price and weight.|$|R
5000|$|The PowerBook 190 and its {{companion}} PowerBook 190cs are {{laptop computers}} manufactured by Apple Computer {{as part of}} their PowerBook brand, introduced to the market in August 1995. The two models differ only in their screen: The 190 had a 9.5" [...] greyscale display, while the 190cs featured a 10.4" [...] color display. Apple's target sales audience for this model was the college student in need of a no-frills portable computer. In terms of hardware, along with the PowerBook 150, the 190 has much in common with Apple's [...] "professional" [...] laptop of the same period, the PowerBook 5300 series. In exchange for the cheaper price point (approximately US$2200 compared to over US$6000 for the cutting-edge PowerBook 5300ce), the 190 was equipped with a passive matrix LCD rather than a crisper <b>active</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>screen.</b> More significantly, while the 5300s ran PowerPC 603e processors at 100 or 117 MHz, the 190 had only a Motorola 68LC040 clocked at 33 MHz - in fact, the 190s were the last Macintoshes to use a 68k CPU. However, Apple offered a PPC upgrade for the 190, a heavily marketed selling point for all new 68040 Macs at the time. In addition, a rather cramped 500 MB IDE hard drive was standard, and factory models shipped with System 7.5.2. It {{is the only one of}} the 100 series PowerBooks that does not use the original 140 case design, thus was the only one to include a 68040 processor, a trackpad rather than the standard trackball, and along with the 150 the only ones to provide for more than 14MB RAM expansion and larger, less-expensive IDE drives. The 190 was the de facto replacement for the PowerBook 500 series, which was completely discontinued with the introduction of the 5300 and the only 68040-based PowerBook Apple offered.|$|R

50|$|The 2400c {{uses the}} same PowerPC 603e {{processor}} as the preceding Duo 2300c, but {{at a much higher}} CPU clock — 180 instead of 100 MHz. However, the 2400 is unable to utilize the DuoDock like the 2300c was, making the lack of an internal removable drive much more noticeable. Like the PowerBook 100 and Duo series before it, it was sold with an external floppy drive. Apple did not offer a CD-ROM drive for it which was otherwise standard for all other PowerBooks. Unlike the Duo, reinstated peripheral ports on the machine most closely matched those of the original 100 and include: ADB, one combined serial printer/modem port, floppy port (not HDI-20 but unique to the 2400c), HDI-30 SCSI port, but added a VGA video out, as well as a stereo sound out and in, infrared port, and two PCMCIA card slots. The original 180 Mhz model's PCMCIA slots officially accept only 2 Type II or 1 Type III PCMCIA-spec cards. But some users have applied simple motherboard modifications to allow the use of Cardbus expansion cards as well, extending the practical life of this subcompact until a replacement was eventually offered by Apple. The Japan 240 Mhz model offered Cardbus as standard. The 2400 is built around a 10.4 in <b>active</b> <b>matrix</b> color LCD <b>screen,</b> making the computer very compact indeed — it is slightly smaller and lighter, though a bit thicker, than a 12 in iBook, and the fourth-smallest subnotebook behind the 12 in PowerBook G4 introduced several years later.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Active</b> <b>matrix</b> organic light {{emitting}} diode (AMOLED) displays are considerably attractive for high brightness, high efficiency and fast response time. <b>Active</b> <b>matrix</b> employing thin Film Transistors (TFTs) allows OLED displays to be larger in size, higher in resolution and lower in power consumption than passive matrix. Especially, low temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) TFT employing excimer laser annealing (ELA) is widely used due to high mobility and high stability. A number of TFT <b>active</b> <b>matrix</b> pixel circuits have been developed in order to compensate for TFT parameter variations due to the fluctuation of excimer laser energy. We discuss various compensation schemes of LTPS TFT pixel circuits...|$|R

40|$|Several matrix metalloproteinases and serine proteinases are {{upregulated}} in migrating keratinocytes during cutaneous wound repair. Single {{cell culture}} studies indicate {{the necessity for}} matrix metalloproteinases but not for serine proteinases in keratinocyte locomotion. To account for epithelial–mesenchymal interactions, an ex vivo human skin wound model was used to investigate the contribution of matrix metalloproteinases and serine proteinases to wound healing by treatment with broad-spectrum inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (BB- 3103) or serine proteinases (aprotinin). Human skin explants with circular 3 [*]mm superficial defects were incubated in culture medium without (controls) or with the proteinase inhibitors for 7 [*]d. BB- 3103 abrogated epithelialization (p < 0. 001), whereas aprotinin-treated wounds and controls were covered with new epithelium. Lack of epithelialization was unlikely due to cytotoxicity because the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor did neither influence viability of cultured epidermal keratinocytes nor apoptosis in wounds. Involvement of specific matrix metalloproteinases in epithelialization was analyzed by gelatin zymography, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. Wound healing was accompanied by <b>active</b> <b>matrix</b> metalloproteinase- 1 and increased <b>active</b> <b>matrix</b> metalloproteinase- 2 but irrespectively of <b>active</b> <b>matrix</b> metalloproteinase- 9.
