5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, Americans like William Billings were {{establishing}} a <b>bold,</b> <b>new</b> style of vocal performance, markedly distinct from European traditions. John Cole, an important publisher and tune collector in Baltimore, known for pushing a rarefied European outlook on American music, responded with the tunebook Beauties of Psalmody, which denigrated the new techniques, especially fuguing. Cole continued publishing tunebooks up to 1842, and soon began operating his own singing school. Besides Cole, Baltimore {{was home to}} other major music publishers as well. These included Wheeler Gillet, who focused on dignified, European-style music like Cole did, and Samuel Dyer, who collected more distinctly American-styled songs. The tunebooks published in Baltimore included instructional notes, using {{a broad array of}} music education techniques then common. Ruel Shaw, for example, used a system derived from the work of Heinrich Pestalozzi, interpreted by the American Lowell Mason. Though the Pestalozzian system was widely used in Baltimore, other techniques were tried, such as that developed by local singing master James M. Deems, based on the Italian solfeggi system.|$|E

25|$|However this <b>bold</b> <b>new</b> {{look was}} not to last, as Tyne Tees adopted the 1989 ITV generic look. The look {{consisted}} of the top left corner of the logo being inserted into the 'V' segment of the ITV logo, with the station name placed underneath the Tyne Tees ITV logo. However, not every ITV station embraced the new logo, and Tyne Tees abandoned it in 1991.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, {{the route}} {{came under the}} control of the newly created Network SouthEast, which {{introduced}} a <b>bold</b> <b>new</b> blue, red and white livery. The extension of the overhead line equipment soon allowed the units to work services on the West Anglia route from London Liverpool Street to Cambridge. In 1992, electrification spread north from Cambridge to Ely and King's Lynn, allowing the replacement of locomotive-hauled trains.|$|E
25|$|Rock climber Peter Croft began what {{continues}} to be a long and illustrious climbing career in Squamish in the late 1970s. He astounded the climbing community by putting up a number of <b>bold</b> <b>new</b> free climbing routes on the Chief which, at the time, pushed the limits of what people thought was possible. More recently, Brad Zdanivsky became the first quadriplegic ever to reach the summit on 31 July 2005. In the summer of 2006, Sonnie Trotter established what was at the time considered to be the hardest traditionally protected single rock pitch in North America, and possibly the world: Cobra Crack (5.14).|$|E

25|$|Away {{from the}} {{historic}} area, UVA's architecture and its {{allegiance to the}} Jeffersonian design are controversial. The 1990s saw the construction of two deeply contrasting visions: the Williams Tsien post-modernist Hereford College in 1992 and the unapologetically Jeffersonian Darden School of Business in 1996. Commentary on both was broad and partisan, as the University of Virginia School of Architecture and The New York Times lauded Hereford for its <b>bold</b> <b>new</b> lines, while some independent press and wealthy donors praised the traditional design of Darden. The latter group appeared to have largely won {{the day when the}} South Lawn Project was designed in the early 2000s.|$|E
25|$|Jones passionately {{believed}} {{in the search for}} a modern style unique to the nineteenth century – one which was radically different to the prevailing aesthetics of Neo-Classicism and the Gothic Revival. He looked towards the Islamic world for much of this inspiration, using his carefully observed studies of Islamic decoration at the Alhambra to develop <b>bold</b> <b>new</b> theories on flat patterning, geometry and abstraction in ornament. The V's Word & Image Department holds the world's most comprehensive collection of Owen Jones material – including travel sketches, illuminated books, wallpapers and original design drawings for tiles, textiles, furniture, metalwork, interior decoration and architecture. Other departments within the museum hold examples of his furniture and textiles.|$|E
25|$|The series began taping in colour in late 1974. This period {{also saw}} the series shift its {{emphasis}} from sexual situations and drama {{to focus more on}} comedy, however by mid-1975 ratings had gone into decline so a <b>bold</b> <b>new</b> storyline was concocted in the hope of revitalising the series. The Mad Bomber storyline, in August–September 1975, came in the wake of news from periodical TV Week that the ratings for Number 96 had dropped to just half what they had been at the beginning of 1974. In an unprecedented move, 40 complete scripts were discarded and rewritten, while the Number 96 set was sealed off to non-essential personnel. The new storyline involved a mysterious figure planting a time bomb in Number 96, following a series of warnings and false alarms. The dramatic storyline was intended to draw back viewers and to provide a mechanism to quickly write out several existing characters in a bid to fresh up the cast of characters and revamp the storylines.|$|E

Montgomery went on to call it [...] "blissed out and buzzy, born of a brilliant concept, and an absolute blast to watch". [...] Fuse's Nicole James surmised that the world records were [...] "adorable", while Steff Yotka of Nylon deemed them [...] "crazy, funny, weird" [...] and concluded that they [...] "make for a truly excellent viewing experience" [...] On the critical side, Mish Way—writing for Vice—opined that the video's concept did not relate to the song's theme. Way dubbed the clip a [...] "major fuck-up" [...] but called Williams an [...] "irresistible charm".|$|E
500|$|His first {{commission}} {{seems to}} have been for extensions to Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, for Charles Hope, 1st Earl of Hopetoun. Hopetoun had been built only 20 years before by Sir William Bruce, and Adam was retained to rebuild the south-east wing. These works, completed in 1725, aimed to give the east front a <b>bold</b> <b>new</b> facade, stepping forward at the ends with curved sections. According to John Fleming, [...] "nothing so ambitious or imaginative had ever before been attempted in Scotland". Over the following years, Adam would return to Hopetoun, building the south colonnade from 1726, the north wing from 1728, and finally the pavilions from 1736. These were not finished until 1742, the year of the Earl's death, and the completed scheme was finished by Adam's sons after his own death. Adam also laid out the gardens, possibly to designs by Bruce, whose axial style they follow.|$|E
500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote that [...] "the episode sings when it reinvents the old and {{introduces}} the new." [...] However, Shearman and Pearson criticized the bringing back of Gibson Praise, noting that [...] "the return of Gibson Praise almost derails the episode altogether [...] he only manages to make an episode that seemed {{as if it was}} giving The X-Files a <b>bold</b> <b>new</b> beginning feel like it's about to offer more of the same old stooge." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations wrote a moderately positive review of the episode. He noted, [...] "In many ways, 'Within' reminded us why we tune into The X-Files every week. However, it also reminded us why the road ahead will be difficult. Fox Mulder may be gone, but he will never be forgotten. Or replaced." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{different}} vein, films {{began to appear}} that self-consciously acknowledged the conventions of classic film noir as historical archetypes to be revived, rejected, or reimagined. These efforts typify {{what came to be}} known as neo-noir. Though several late classic noirs, Kiss Me Deadly in particular, were deeply self-knowing and post-traditional in conception, none tipped its hand so evidently as to be remarked on by American critics at the time. The first major film to overtly work this angle was French director Jean-Luc Godard's À bout de souffle (Breathless; 1960), which pays its literal respects to Bogart and his crime films while brandishing a <b>bold</b> <b>new</b> style for a new day. In the United States, Arthur Penn (Mickey One , drawing inspiration from Truffaut's Tirez sur le pianiste and other French New Wave films), John Boorman (Point Blank , similarly caught up, though in the Nouvelle vague's deeper waters), and Alan J. Pakula (Klute [...] ) directed films that knowingly related themselves to the original film noirs, inviting audiences in on the game.|$|E
500|$|The {{theoretical}} biologist Mary Jane West-Eberhard {{reviewed the}} book in detail for the Quarterly Review of Biology as a work [...] "of special significance". She began it with a fable of a [...] "small community of modest scholars called natural historians" [...] who all practised their own sciences, until one day a man who [...] "had been called Entomologist, Ecologist, and even Biochemist" [...] arose among them and pronounced [...] "there shall be a new science". She wrote that Wilson had [...] "assumed god-like powers with this book", attempting to reformulate {{the foundations of the}} social sciences, making ethology and comparative psychology obsolete, and restructuring behavioural biology. She marvelled at the [...] "sustained enthusiasm and authoritativeness" [...] across a wide range of fields not Wilson's own, and the usefulness of many of the chapters. [...] "In this book sociobiology is a patchwork neatly stitched from relevant pieces of other fields, without a <b>bold</b> <b>new</b> theoretical pattern of its own". She objected strongly to what she considered Wilson's [...] "confused and misleading" [...] discussion of altruism and group selection, arguing that kin selection provided an alternative (fully Darwinian) explanation and that Wilson was wrong to make it seem that group selection was necessary.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times Neil Genzlinger {{said that}} the funny script and skilled editing {{potentially}} made it the [...] "Animal House of the iPhone generation". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised the film for updating the clichés of similarly themed films from the 1970s to the 1980s like Animal House and Risky Business [...] "so that they look just dangerous enough to make nostalgia feel naughty", but stated that the film does not offer anything more outrageous than real parties, despite implying [...] "that it's breaking down <b>bold</b> <b>new</b> barriers of misbehavior". Gleiberman accused negative reviews of [...] "fulfilling the role of all those uptight parents in '50s news reports {{about the dangers of}} rock & roll", by applying moral judgments to the events of the film. Time Out Joshua Rothkopf gave the film four stars out of five, calling it [...] "brainless", but feeling that the sheer anarchy of the film's events were [...] "thrilling". Pete Travers of Rolling Stone praised the film as [...] "gut-bustingly funny" [...] that appealed to a base youth element to become [...] "shitfaced and run amok", and said that it puts its own spin on Animal House. Travers gave particular mention to Mann as [...] "excellent"; however, he also stated that Nourizadeh's filmmaking was a [...] "disaster".|$|E

500|$|The Milwaukee Journals Tina Maples {{provided}} a mixed review for the album, criticizing its [...] "hoary cliches" [...] and [...] "bland, mid-tempo soul-pop ballads that confuse sophistication with sonambulism", {{and added that}} with the album, Madonna was feeling the [...] "fallout" [...] of building her career on [...] "shock value". However, she highlighted [...] "Secret", [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] as the standout tracks from Bedtime Stories. Steve Morse, writer from The Boston Globe journal, criticized the album for lacking [...] "life", and being [...] "flat and listless", and said that Madonna seemed lost throughout the album. Allen Metz and Carol Benson, authors of The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, opined that [...] "rather than signify(ing) some <b>bold</b> <b>new</b> direction for Madonna, Bedtime Stories takes hardly any risks at all. [...] it offers neither the pop epiphany of Like a Prayer nor the shameless frolic of Madonna's earlier dance hits". British magazine NME ranked Bedtime Stories as the 30th best album of 1994. At the 38th Grammy Awards in 1996, the album received a nomination for Best Pop Album. Slant Magazine included Bedtime Stories on their list of [...] "The Best Albums of the 1990s" [...] at number 63, with Cinquemani writing, [...] "instead of simply following American trends of the time, Madge infused the album with the edgier trip-hop sounds that were happening {{on the other side}} of the pond. But it was her refined literary taste, from Proust to Whitman, and both the media and the public's rejection of her sexual politicking that truly informed the singer's seventh album." ...|$|E
