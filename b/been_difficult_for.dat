5|$|The tower-keep had {{a modest}} entrance, which was reached by a draw-bridge that lay across the {{surrounding}} moat, which initially reached {{right up to}} the base of the castle. A simple, 12-foot (3.6 m) high bailey wall, with minimal defensive value, surrounded the moat, which was in contrast wide, 10-foot (3 m) deep, and would have <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> an attacker to drain. On the east side of the castle Nunney Brook was used as a line of defence rather than a bailey wall.|$|E
5|$|Nickel, {{formerly}} {{used in the}} cent, now had {{no place}} in American coinage. This was unsatisfactory to Wharton, who sought its return. Although Pollock {{made no mention of}} further nickel coinage in his 1864 annual report, Wharton in April of that year published a pamphlet proposing that all non-precious metal coinage be composed of 75% copper and 25% nickel. The copper-nickel cents had contained only 12% nickel, and even so had <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the Mint to strike due to the hardness of the metal, the use of which damaged equipment and quickly broke dies. An alloy of 25% nickel would be even more difficult to coin. Wharton argued that the tough alloy would be difficult to counterfeit.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few days, bad weather {{prevented}} more large attacks. On 9 and 11 September, only smaller raids were carried out. It gave Hugh Dowding AOC (Air Officer Commanding) Fighter Command, the chance to prepare and reinforce his forces. The British, possibly {{through the use of}} Ultra intelligence, recognised the German change in strategy and duly prepared for further attacks on the capital. ULTRA's contribution to the preparations for 15 September is also disputed. The intelligence from ULTRA at this stage in the war tended to be fragmented. With the Germans launching attacks whenever there was clear weather, it would not have <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> RAF Fighter Command to have predicted an attack on 15 September, which was to be a clear day.|$|E

5|$|Modeled on The Lord of the Rings, the Ice and Fire {{story begins}} with a tight focus on a small group (with {{everyone}} in Winterfell, except Daenerys) and then splits into separate stories. The storylines are to converge again, but finding the turning point in this complex series has <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Martin and has slowed down his writing. Depending on the interview, Martin {{is said to have}} reached the turning point in A Dance with Dragons, or to not quite have reached it yet in the books. The series' structure of multiple POVs and interwoven storylines was inspired by Wild Cards, a multi-authored shared universe book series edited by Martin since 1985. As the sole author, Martin begins each new book with an outline of the chapter order and may write a few successive chapters from a single character's viewpoint instead of working chronologically. The chapters are later rearranged to optimize character intercutting, chronology, and suspense.|$|E
5|$|Neuner {{went into}} her first Winter Olympics in Vancouver with the {{declared}} aim of winning a gold medal. On 13 February 2010, she participated in the opening sprint, which was contested at Whistler Olympic Park in rainy conditions. With one shooting error, Neuner claimed the silver medal, finishing 1.5seconds behind Slovakia's Anastasiya Kuzmina. She uncharacteristically lost five seconds against the unheralded Slovak on the cross-country course, which led to speculation of inferior ski preparation in the German media. Three days later, Neuner won gold in the subsequent pursuit race. Despite missing two targets in the standing position, she beat sprint winner Kuzmina by 12.3seconds. In her third Olympic event, she finished tenth in the individual. She had three shooting mistakes and said it had <b>been</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> her to immediately get her concentration back after winning her first gold medal. On 21 February 2010, Neuner claimed her second gold of the Games in the mass start. After missing two targets, she had been trailing {{by as much as}} 29seconds, but she pushed the pace and a clean final standing shoot allowed her to overtake Russia's Olga Zaitseva on the last lap. After the race, Neuner made the announcement not to participate in the relay, citing mental exhaustion and her desire to give all of her team mates the chance to win a medal. Her withdrawal allowed her friend Martina Beck a start in her last Olympic Games. Neuner was Germany's most successful athlete in Vancouver and was chosen to carry the German flag at the closing ceremony.|$|E
