Thus, the delivery of boron by the degradation of <b>borate</b> <b>glass</b> is of special interest in biomedical applications. However, the cytotoxicity of <b>borate</b> <b>glass</b> which arises with the rapid release of boron has to be carefully considered. In this study, {{it was found that}} the incorporation of strontium into <b>borate</b> <b>glass</b> can not only moderate the rapid release of boron, but also induce the adhesion of osteoblast-like cells, SaOS- 2, thus significantly increasing the cyto-compatibility of <b>borate</b> <b>glass.</b> The formation of multilayers of apatite with porous structure indicates that complete degradation is optimistic, and the spread of SaOS- 2 covered by apatite to form a sandwich structure may induce bone-like tissue formation at earlier stages.
