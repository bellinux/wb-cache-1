25|$|Following the {{tentative}} agreement for a merger in Sweden, negotiations {{to create a}} European branch of SAS started on 1 December 1947. It was agreed that the SAS-brand was {{to be used to}} brand all international flights as SAS. European SAS (ESAS) was, unlike the transatlantic agreement, only a <b>business</b> <b>agreement,</b> whereby the three companies agreed to pool their flights and operate a single set of facilities abroad. Each company would close its own operations and offices in the other two Scandinavian countries, leaving that to the national airline. In all European cities, only the best office and employees would remain, rationalizing operations and presenting the three airlines' operations under a single brand. ESAS was launched on 18 April 1948, and was led by a main committee and had Viggo J. Rasmussen as director. The head office and operational center for ESAS was located at Copenhagen Airport, in part because of a long-term mechanics strike at Bromma. At the same time, the SAS consortium was internally named Overseas SAS (OSAS).|$|E
