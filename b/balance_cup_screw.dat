40|$|Chronic {{irritation}} of the iliopsoas tendon {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} persistent pain after total joint replacement of the hip. In the majority of cases, pain results from a mechanical conflict between the iliopsoas tendon and the anterior edge of the acetabular cup after total hip arthroplasty. Pain can be reproduced by active flexion of the hip and by active raising of the straightened leg. In addition, painful leg raising against resistance and passive hyperextension are suggestive of an irritation of the iliopsoas tendon. Symptoms evolve from a mechanical irritation of the iliopsoas tendon and an oversized or retroverted acetabular <b>cup,</b> <b>screws</b> penetrating into the inner aspect of the ilium, or from bone cement protruding beyond the anterior acetabular rim. The diagnosis may be assumed on conventional radiographs and confirmed by CT scans. Fifteen patients with psoas irritation after total hip replacement are reported on. Eleven patients were treated surgically. The acetabular cup was revised and reoriented with more anteversion in six patients, isolated screws penetrating into the tendon were cut and leveled in three patients, and prominent bone cement {{in conflict with the}} tendon was resected once. A partial release of the iliopsoas tendon only was performed in another patient. Follow-up examination (range: 11 - 89 months) revealed that nine patients were free of pain and two patient had mild residual complaints.

In order to treat these problems, limiting the possible complications connected {{to the use of}} massive bone allograft (bulky or morcellized), and to simplify the surgical procedure we thought to apply in selected cases the platelet’s derived autologous growth factors (AGF), alone or added to Granular Hydroxyapatite. From january 2001 to june 2003 we have applied-autologous growth factors in 10 cases. The diagnosis was: 5 acetabula in primary THR, 2 acetabular and 1 femoral revision after THR, 1 femoral and 1 tibial revision after TKR. We applied the pure AGF in 2 cases and AGF plus Granular Hydroxyapatite in 8 cases.

40|$|<b>Screwed</b> {{acetabular}} <b>cups,</b> {{applied in}} total hip replacements, generate stresses {{in the surrounding}} bone during implantation (prestresses). The effect of these prestresses on the endurance of the hip replacement are unknown. The prestresses in the acetabulum were examined both experimentally, using strain gauge techniques, and numerically, using the finite element method. It {{was found that the}} prestresses were of the same order of magnitude, if not larger, than the stresses due to the hip reaction force during one-legged stance. In some cases, the prestresses even approximated the ultimate tensile strength of cortical bone. The prestresses seemed to have a strong dependence on the outer shape of the cup, rather than on the flexibility of the cup or whether the cup had a self-cutting thread or not. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} prestresses are not very susceptible to stress relaxation due to the visco-elastic behaviour of bone. This means that prestresses will remain present over long periods of time. So even when a patient has resumed normal daily activities, the prestresses will still play an important role in the overall stress distributions around the acetabulum.

30|$|We also {{evaluated}} {{the reconstruction of}} the center of rotation of the hip achieved with these devices. Both an anatomic hip center and maximum bone host contact are desirable postoperatively to support stability. Some authors have reported excellent long-term results using the high hip center technique [4, 17, 34], but other series have reported a higher aseptic loosening rate for a nonanatomical acetabular component site [30, 39]. Finite-element analysis of a protruded acetabulum has shown that stress on the deficient medial wall varies as a directly function of medial placement of the cup [8]. Different authors report that correcting a deficient acetabulum to the anatomical position is crucial for achieving good long-term results [21, 30, 39]. In our study, a good acetabular reconstruction was obtained in most cases. Although the number and positions of the screws were chosen according to the primary stability of the <b>cup,</b> a <b>screw</b> fixed to the pubis using other devices can be recommended, since we only used this in bone defects of type 3 A or 3 B, and this could have influenced the results [7].

40|$|Background: Vascular injury during {{minimally}} invasive {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) is uncommon, yet a well-recognized and serious issue. It emerges because of non-visibility of vascular structures proximal to the pelvic bone during reaming, drilling holes, and fixing of screws. Numerous {{studies have found that}} screw fixation during cementless THA is beneficial for the initial stability of cup; yet, no anatomical guidelines support angular eccentric screw fixation. Materials and Methods: In this study, we obtained the pelvic arterial-phase computed tomographic data of thirty eight humans and reconstructed the three-dimensional models of osseous and vessel structures. We performed the surgical simulation to fix these structures with cementless <b>cups</b> and <b>screws</b> with angular eccentricities.

40|$|Background The {{removal of}} well-fixed {{acetabular}} components following THA (total hip arthroplasty) {{is a difficult}} operation and could be accompanied {{by the loss of}} acetabular bone stock. The optimal method for fixation is still under debate. The aim of this pilot study was to compare the tear-out resistance and failure behavior between osseo-integrated and non-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>cups.</b> Furthermore, we examined whether there are differences in the properties mentioned between screw sockets and cemented polyethylene cups. Hypothesis Tear-out resistance and related mechanical work required for the tear-out of osseo-integrated screw sockets are higher than in non-integrated screw sockets. Patients and methods Ten human coxal bones from six cadavers with osseo-integrated screw sockets (n = 4), non-integrated (implanted post-mortem, n = 3) screw sockets and cemented polyethylene cups (n = 3) were used for tear-out testing. The parameters axial failure load and mechanical work for tear-out were introduced as measures for determining the stability of acetabular components following THA. Results The osseo-integrated screw sockets yielded slightly higher tear-out resistance (1. 61 ± 0. 26 kN) and related mechanical work compared to the non-integrated screw sockets (1. 23 ± 0. 39 kN, P = 0. 4). The cemented polyethylene cups yielded the lowest tear-out resistance with a failure load of 1. 18 ± 0. 24 kN. Compared to the <b>screw</b> <b>cups</b> implanted while alive, they also differ on a non-significant level (P = 0. 1). Osseous failure patterns differed especially for the screw sockets compared to the cemented polyethylene cups. Discussion Osseo-integration did not greatly influence the tear-out stability in cementless screw sockets following axial loading. Furthermore, the strength of the bone-implant-interface of cementless screw sockets appears to be similar to cemented polyethylene cups. However, given the high failure load, high mechanical load and because of the related bone failure patterns, removal should not be performed by means of tear-out but rather by osteotomes or other curved cutting devices to preserve the acetabular bone stock...|$|R
40|$|Total hip {{arthroplasty}} is a {{very successful}} procedure. Despite this fact, however, a certain portion of patients has to be revised. One major reason for revision is the wear of the polyethylene leading to loosening and osteolysis. The overall aim of this thesis was to evaluate linear wear and migration of cemented, all - polyethylene sockets and polyethylene liners in total hip arthroplasty. The aim was also to identify patients for whom increased wear was a risk and who therefore were likely to require a revision, and further to evaluate different methods for measuring wear and their accuracy Material and results Study I: 154 hips had received an uncemented Omnifit total hip. 66 cups were revised and in these cases mean annual wear was 0. 32 mm compared to 0. 12 mm in hips not revised. Osteolytic processes were present in 51 patients at revision but these could be observed in only 35 hips on radiographs. Micromotion evaluated by RSA, weight, age, side, size of <b>cup,</b> <b>screw</b> fixation, polyethylene thickness or shelf - life of the polyethylene did not correlate to wear, whereas male gender did. Study II: Cross - linked N-telopeptide of type I Collagen (NTx), a marker of osteoclast - mediated bone resorption, has been proposed {{for the evaluation of}} the often non-symptomatic peri-prosthetic osteolysis. NTx in urine was analysed in 160 patients with and without osteolysis. The group of patients with osteolysis had significantly higher mean NTx levels (p= 0. 03) and an increased annual wear of the polyethylene. Study III: 120 patients were randomised to have a primary total hip replacement with one out of four possible articulations. The femoral heads were of conventional steel or of a new ceramic, zirconium oxide. The cup was either made of conventional polyethylene or of polyethylene that had been reheated under pressure, Hylamer. All combinations that included Hylamer or Zirconium oxide had increased polyethylene wear as compared to the standard steel / polyethylene combination (p< 0. 008). 12 patients have been revised to date- none had a stainless steel / polyethylene articulation. Study IV: Polyethylene penetration (wear) was measured by RSA in 111 patients by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) in the supine and weight-bearing position. There was a small (0. 02 mm) systematic difference. The degree of penetration of the head into the polyethylene or the time for the first examination did not alter this result. Study V: We analysed the accuracy of 2 radiostereometric (RSA) techniques for wear measurement and 3 standard radiographic techniques using a phantom with different prosthetic components. The mean differences between phantom and measurement were, for digital RSA examinations 0. 010 mm (accuracy 0. 42, n= 175).

Methods: Eighty-nine extra-large uncemented hemispherical acetabular components were used for revision after aseptic failure of a total hip arthroplasty in forty-six men and forty-three women (mean age at revision, fifty-nine years; range, thirty to eighty-three years). The revision implant (a Harris-Galante-I or II <b>cup</b> fixed with <b>screws)</b> had an outside diameter of ≥ 66 mm in men and ≥ 62 mm in women.

In this study, we evaluated the results of total 49 hip replacements (THRs) using an uncemented total hip prosthesis in 44 patients (28 females) who were 30  years or younger (range: 15 – 30  years). The diagnosis was ostearthritis due to congenital dislocations in 28 patients, with the remaining patients having diagnoses of sequelae of fracture, infection, Calve-Legg-Perthes disease, avascular necrosis, chondrodystrophia and epiphyseal dysplasia. In all cases we used an uncemented straight stem fully coated with hydroxyapatite (HA). In 36 cases we used a hemispherical cup inserted with press fit, and in seven cases we used a hemispherical <b>screw</b> <b>cup.</b> The patients were evaluated ten to 16  years (mean: 13  years) after the operation by radiographic and clinical examinations, including the Harris Hip, WOMAC and EuroQol- 5 D scores.

None of the stems were revised at the follow-up examination, and all were classified as well integrated, with no signs of radiological loosening. Twenty-four hips had revision of the acetabular component due to mechanical failure. The Harris Hip score was, on average, 88 (range: 62 – 100), the WOMAC score 80 (range: 37 – 100) and the EuroQol score 0. 68 (range: − 0. 14 – 1). Isokinetic muscle strength testing showed that seven of the nine tested patients were weaker on the operated side. In conclusion, we found mechanical failures at the acetabular side, but excellent results with a fully HA-coated femoral stem, with no revisions after ten to 16  years...|$|R
40|$|Specialty coffees can be {{differentiated}} {{in various}} ways, including the environmental {{conditions in which}} they are produced and the sensory composition of the drink. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of altitude, slope exposure and fruit color on the sensory attributes of cafes of the region of Matas de Minas. Sampling points were georeferenced in four altitude ranges (825 m, 825 950 m) of the coffee crop; two fruit colors of var. Catuaí (yellowand red); and two slope exposures (North-facing and South-facing). Coffee fruit at the cherry stage were processed andsubmitted to sensory analysis. The sensory attributes evaluated were overall perception, clean <b>cup,</b> <b>balance,</b> aftertaste, sweetness, acidity, body and flavor, which made up the final score. The scores were examined by ANOVA and means werecompared by the Tukey test (p < 0. 05). From the sensory standpoint, coffee fruits of both colors are similar, as well as the cof fees from both slope exposures when these factors were analyzed separately. However, at higher altitudes, Y ellow Catuaí produces coffees with better sensory quality. Similarly, coffees from North-facing slopes, at higher altitudes produce better quality cup. The altitude is the main factor that interferes with coffee quality in the area. All factors together contribute tothe final quality of the beverage produced in the region of Matas de Minas. 201...|$|R
