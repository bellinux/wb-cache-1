5|$|The House of Representatives easily {{passed the}} bill in just seven days. The most {{contentious}} issue was the inclusion of Section 7(a), which protected collective bargaining rights for unions. Section 7(a) was nearly passed into the bill, <b>but</b> <b>Senator</b> Wagner, Jerome Frank, and Leon Keyserling (another Roosevelt aide) worked to retain the section {{in order to win}} the support of the American labor movement.|$|E
5|$|Senators raised {{concerns}} that the Congress could either abuse such authority or neglect to enact any such legislation after the adoption of this proposal. Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, a long-time advocate for addressing the disability question, spearheaded the effort until {{he died of a}} heart attack on August 10, 1963. Senator Keating was defeated in the 1964 election, <b>but</b> <b>Senator</b> Roman Hruska of Nebraska took up Keating's cause as a new member of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments.|$|E
5|$|As the 1880 {{elections}} approached, Randall had two goals: {{to increase}} his control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, and to nominate Tilden for president. His efforts at the former in 1875 had been successful, <b>but</b> <b>Senator</b> William Wallace's faction was again growing powerful. If he wanted to hold the Speakership, {{as well as to}} wield influence in the next presidential canvass, Randall believed he must have a united state party behind him. To that end, Randall spent much of his time outside of Congress travelling around his home state to line up support at the state convention in 1880. Some of his allies' enthusiasm backfired against him, however, after McMullen and some supporters broke up an anti-Randall meeting in Philadelphia's 5th ward with such violence that one man was left dead.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Gallipoli Campaign {{had ended}} and the AIF in Egypt {{was in the process}} of {{doubling}} in size from two divisions to four. Birdwood wished to appoint two British generals to command the new divisions, <b>but</b> <b>Senator</b> Pearce opposed this, ordering that one be given to McCay. On 22 March 1916, McCay arrived back in Egypt to assume command of the 5th Division. He found that General Headquarters, Egyptian Expeditionary Force had ordered II Anzac Corps, of which the 5th Division was a part, to replace I Anzac Corps in the defence of the Suez Canal. Owing to a shortage of rolling stock, the 4th and 5th Divisions were ordered to undertake a three-day route march across the desert under service conditions, carrying their packs and weapons. This proved to be a greater test of staff and troops than anticipated, and many men dropped from thirst or exhaustion. Many of his men blamed McCay for subjecting them to such a humiliating and severe trial.|$|E
500|$|In March 1869, President Grant made {{it known}} he desired the Tenure of Office Act repealed, stating {{it was a}} [...] "stride toward a {{revolution}} in our free system". The Tenure of Office Act was passed by Congress in 1867, sponsored by Radical Republicans, to curb {{the power of the}} President Andrew Johnson in making government office appointments. The controversial law had been invoked during the impeachment trial of Johnson in 1868. [...] On March 5, 1869, a bill was brought before Congress to repeal the act, <b>but</b> <b>Senator</b> Charles Sumner was opposed, unwilling to give Grant a free hand in making appointments. Grant, to bolster the repeal effort, declined to make any new appointments except for vacancies, until the law was overturned, thus, agitating political office seekers to pressure Congress to repeal the law. Under national pressure for governmental reform, a compromise was reached and a new bill was passed that allowed the President to have complete control over removing his own cabinet, however, government appointees needed the approval of Congress within a thirty-day period. Grant, who did not desire a party split over the matter, signed the bill; afterwards, he received criticism for not getting a full repeal of the law. The unpopular measure was completely repealed in 1887. Grant was criticized for appointing many family members considered unqualified to highly sought government posts, a practice known as nepotism.|$|E

[...] The board of the National Park Service refused the request <b>but</b> <b>Senator</b> John D. Works, and Joseph R.

On March 31, 2008 he congratulated Fox News {{on what he}} {{considered to be the}} best campaign coverage. Addressing Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy, Rendell said, [...] "I think during this entire primary coverage, starting in Iowa and up to the present, Fox has done the fairest job, has remained the most objective of all the cable networks ...

2500|$|During {{the budget}} battles in 1979 over {{the cost of}} the Hart Senate Office Building, funds for {{completion}} of the Calder work were deleted. <b>But</b> <b>Senator</b> Nicholas F. Brady, who had been appointed to serve out the unexpired term of Senator Harrison A. Williams (who had resigned on March 11, 1982, after his bribery conviction in the Abscam scandal), decided in June 1982 to establish the Capitol Art Foundation. [...] The foundation's goal was to raise funds for the placement of art through the United States Capitol Complex. By June 1985, the foundation had raised $250,000 ($ in [...] dollars) to manufacture and $400,000 ($ in [...] dollars) to install Mountains and Clouds. Most of the money came from billionaire art collector Paul Mellon and C. Douglas Dillon. The work was dedicated in a ceremony held on May 5, 1987.|$|E

They began dating after meeting again in June 1991 {{at a party}} celebrating her parents' 40th wedding anniversary. [...] Ted Kennedy said of this meeting, [...] "I had known Vicki before, {{but this was the}} first time I think I really saw her." [...] The relationship became serious in September 1991. [...] They were engaged in March 1992, and married July 3, 1992, in a civil ceremony at his home in McLean, Virginia.

5|$|Lame duck {{president}} John Quincy Adams nominated Crittenden to the U.S. Supreme Court on December 17, 1828 <b>but</b> <b>Senators</b> {{who supported}} president-elect Jackson voted to postpone confirmation until Jackson could nominate his own man. After his brief service as Kentucky Secretary of State, {{the state legislature}} elected Crittenden to the second of his four non-consecutive stints in the U.S. Senate. Upon his election as president, William Henry Harrison appointed Crittenden as Attorney General, but 5 months after Harrison's death, political differences prompted him to resign rather than continue his service under Harrison's successor, John Tyler.|$|R

2500|$|Although the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably {{reported}} Madden's {{nomination to}} the floor (almost without discussion or comment), Republican Senators Robert A. Taft and Arthur H. Vandenberg, along with other Republicans, attempted {{to hold up the}} nomination on procedural grounds as a means of expressing their anger at what they believed was Madden's pro-labor administration of the National Labor Relations Act. Senator Taft intended to deny Madden's nomination a vote on the Senate floor, arguing that the Judiciary Committee had approved the nomination via telephone voice vote and telegram rather than at a face-to-face meeting. <b>But</b> <b>Senator</b> John E. Miller (chair of the Judiciary subcommittee which had approved the nomination in a face-to-face conference) and Senate Majority Leader Alben W. Barkley both defended the practice, noting it had been used many times before without question. Taft then attacked Madden for four hours on the Senate floor, declaring Madden had [...] "no judicial temperament whatsoever" [...] and that he had perpetrated a [...] "gross perversion of justice" [...] while head of the NRLB. After a struggle to obtain a quorum, the Senate was able to resolve itself for business and voted 36-to-14 to approve Madden's {{nomination to the}} bench.|$|E
2500|$|On May 16, 1912, Senator Augustus Octavius Bacon of Georgia {{submitted}} a {{resolution in the}} U.S. Senate authorizing private persons to construct a memorial to Butt and Millet on federally owned land somewhere in the District of Columbia. [...] Bacon argued that Butt (who was an aide to the president) and Millet (who was {{vice chair of the}} United States Commission of Fine Arts {{at the time of his}} death) were both public servants who deserved to be memorialized separately from the rest of the dead. Bacon also said that a number of memorials in the city had been financed by private dollars, and the Butt-Millet memorial would be no different. As originally introduced, the resolution barred the memorial from being placed on the grounds of the Capitol, Library of Congress, or White House. Bacon asked that the resolution be adopted by the Senate immediately, <b>but</b> <b>Senator</b> William Borah objected and the resolution was referred to the Committee on the Library (which had the authority to accept any work of the fine art on behalf of Congress and designate a location for its placement).|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{political}} factors led to Farmer's appointment {{as chair of}} the NLRB in 1953. [...] Among these was McCarthyism, a strong fear of communism which gripped the United States from 1950 to 1954. [...] Another was the change in political control of the government. [...] In November 1952, Republican Dwight Eisenhower was elected President of the United States, and the Republican Party won majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives. [...] However, the most influential figure on labor relations and labor law was not Eisenhower <b>but</b> <b>Senator</b> Robert A. Taft of Ohio. Taft had co-authored the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, legislation which significantly restricted the use of the strike, outlawed the closed shop, imposed a new class of unfair labor practices (ULPs) on unions, and gave states the right to enact right-to-work laws. [...] Throughout the spring of 1953, the House Committee on Education and Labor and the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare conducted hearings designed {{to lay the groundwork for}} ideological and doctrinal changes at the NLRB once President Eisenhower was able to appoint a majority of the Board's members. Gerard Reilly, a former NLRB member who had helped draft the Taft-Hartley Act, later wrote that the hearings made it clear that the NLRB under chair Paul M. Herzog had construed the law broadly to rein in employers but adopted a narrow view when it came to union ULPs. Witnesses testified that the Board had restricted employer free speech, crafted loopholes to permit unions to engage in secondary boycotts, found new [...] "rights" [...] that permitted unions to challenge employer lockouts, infringed on states' rights, permitted bargaining during the term of the collective bargaining agreement, and expanded the legal list of mandatory bargaining subjects.|$|E

60|$|Elizabeth Grainger, {{who was at}} once {{modern and}} tenaciously conservative, might have been likened {{to some of the}} Roman matrons of the {{aristocracy}} {{in the last years of}} the Republic.

His daughter inherited his executive ability, many of his prejudices (as they would now be called), and his habit of regarding favourable impressions with profound suspicion.
