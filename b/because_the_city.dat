5|$|In 1985, the New York City Health Department {{ordered that}} the city's gay bathhouses be closed. As a result, {{heterosexual}} sex clubs such as Plato's Retreat had {{to shut down}} as well <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> had just passed a gay rights ordinance, and allowing the heterosexual clubs to remain open while closing the gay establishments {{would have been a}} violation of that ordinance.|$|E
5|$|It {{was decided}} to hold the games in Perth <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was to host the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games and Royal Perth Hospital had a well {{developed}} spinal unit that could support paraplegic athletes. The Commonwealth Paraplegic Games were held before the main Games as to not impact on this event and provide the opportunity for athletes to stay on for the main Games.|$|E
5|$|One such {{industry}} is manufacturing. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> is located near Aichi Prefecture and its many major automotive and heavy industry companies, such as Toyota, Gifu {{has become a}} prosperous area for many metalworking, mold and die, and parts subcontractors. Its access to neighboring areas using public transportation and highways has allowed companies to set up many factories and facilities in the area.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{civilian}} {{airport in}} Wuhu <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> airspace {{is used by}} the People's Liberation Army Air Force.|$|R
50|$|All {{exhibits}} must {{be passed}} by voters {{in order for}} construction to begin. This is <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> tax dollars pay for the renovations.|$|R
5000|$|The battle had, like Nocera, little lasting effect <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> of Campania did not revolt as expected, but Ranulf {{was safe}} in Apulia {{until his death}} two years later.|$|R
5|$|The {{two main}} cities are Sabang and Balohan. Balohan is a ferry port {{that serves as}} a hub between the island and Banda Aceh on the {{mainland}} Sumatra. Sabang has been an important quay since the late nineteenth century, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> overlooks the entry to a busy shipping route, Malacca Strait.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his Thracian campaign, Philip moved {{against the}} city of Perinthos, {{formerly}} his ally. Diodorus says that this was <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> had begun to oppose him, and favour the Athenians; however, from Athenian sources, {{there is no indication that}} this was the case. One possible explanation is that Perinthos had refused to send aid to Philip during the Thracian campaign, and it was for this reason he decided to attack it. Either way, since Perinthos was a Greek city, Philip's actions gave the Athenian war-party the excuse it had been looking for to disrupt the peace Philip had wrought in Greece, thereby starting a new phase in the wars.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{the number}} of {{inhabitants}} is known throughout the population censuses conducted since 1793 in Calais. Note the massive growth in population from 13,529 in 1881 to 58,969 in 1886, a growth of 335.9%; this is <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Saint Pierre merged with Calais in 1885. According to the census INSEE of 2008, Calais has 74,817 people (a decrease of 3% from 1999). The town's population ranked 60th nationally, down from 53rd in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the Saddledome allowed Calgary to play host to major musical acts that were {{bypassing}} <b>the</b> <b>city</b> in <b>the</b> early 1980s, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> existing facilities were not {{large enough to accommodate}} the industry's top performers.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, {{which manages}} <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> water, began {{investigating}} {{the possibility of}} [...] "daylighting" [...] underground portions of <b>the</b> creek. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> Yosemite Basin watershed becomes overburdened during heavy rainfall, daylighting could significantly reduce strain on stormwater infrastructure.|$|R
5000|$|Kansas City Royals v. St. Louis Cardinals — I-70 Series or Show-Me Series, {{and named}} so <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> of Kansas City and St. Louis {{are both in}} Missouri, and {{connected}} by Interstate 70. The two teams played in the 1985 World Series.|$|R
5|$|In {{the police}} commissioner's Annual Report for 1919, Curtis {{presented}} {{his view of}} the strike. He argued that he had not even needed the requested State Guards for the strike's first night <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> remained quiet and he had reports that many policemen would not join the strike. By {{the end of the year}} the strikers had formed a new organization called the Association of Former Police of the City of Boston.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Toronto, and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada from September 5-December 8, 2006. Hairspray is explicitly set in Baltimore, Maryland and the original 1988 film had been shot on location there, but the 2007 film was shot primarily in Toronto <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was better equipped with the sound stages necessary to film a musical. The opening shots of the descent from the clouds and the newspaper being dropped onto the stoop are the only times that the actual city of Baltimore {{is shown in the}} film.|$|E
5|$|Several {{ownership}} schemes {{were considered}} {{in the process of}} building and running the system. One plan, which named city officials as the owners and operators of the network, was scrapped <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> lacked the core competency to do it on its own, as well as the $25–30 million capital investment required for the initial construction. The plan which was ultimately adopted entailed a private company building and running the network. This plan met opposition from the Institute for Local Self Reliance, an organization that stated that it believed that the city should build the network itself, and then contract a private company to maintain it.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of the 2006 election, at least two-thirds of its {{residents}} were still displaced. One candidate said in his Times Picayune interview he was running <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> demographics had dramatically changed. There were three unsuccessful lawsuits filed to prevent delaying the original election date.|$|R
50|$|The {{study found}} that at least 70 percent of the {{population}} belonged to the working class. However, labor unions had been driven out of town <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> elite saw them as anti-capitalist. Because of this, unemployment was seen among residents as an individual, not a social, problem.|$|R
50|$|The Mosque of the Jinn (Arabic transliteration: Masjid al-Jinn) is {{a mosque}} in Mecca, located near Jannat al-Mu'alla. It {{is also known as}} the Mosque of Allegiance (Arabic transliteration: Masjid Bai'et) and the Mosque of Guards (Arabic transliteration: Masjid al-Haras) <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> guards would patrol up to that point.|$|R
5|$|The {{decline of}} the town started in the 1520s, when the humanist school lost its former influence. The {{troubles}} surrounding the Protestant Reformation brought instability and unrest to the region. The town experienced the German Peasants' War in 1525 and its convents were sacked by a mob in 1534. During the same period Sélestat lost its pre-eminence in the Decapolis <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Mulhouse left the alliance in 1515 {{and was replaced by}} Landau in 1521, moving the geographical centre of the alliance to the north.|$|E
5|$|To {{fill the}} {{anticipated}} {{lack of a}} fireboat, Phoenix was built in 1954 in Alameda by Hugh F. Munroe of Plant Shipyard, {{paid for by the}} State of California. Her name came from a contest publicized by the Port Authority; the winning suggestion was submitted {{by a member of the}} Phoenix Society, a group of San Francisco citizens interested in civil fire protection. Phoenix, the mythical firebird which rose anew from ashes, seemed appropriate <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of San Francisco had risen seven times from great fires.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the {{rationing}} {{of petroleum}} fuels gave {{a boost to}} ridership on the electric tramways. To handle the massive increase in ridership, the trams were equipped with two conductors. The single-centre-door solution that worked excellently before the war became a bottle-neck as the trams became packed with riders. Lack of parts, particularly for the British Vickers motors, caused long waits for defective vehicles at the depots. From 1942, the Kolsås Line was transferred to terminate at Nationaltheatret in the city centre, and the Class B was operated along the Lilleaker Line from the west. Trams 164–166 were sent to Düsseldorf in Germany, but were never used <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> lacked balloon loops and the trams were too wide.|$|E
50|$|The Contracts House (Контрактовий будинок) is a trade {{building}} in the Podil neighborhood of Kiev (Kyiv), the capital of Ukraine. The Contracts House received its name <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> contracts were signed there. It {{is located on the}} Kontraktova Square, once one of the Podil's main trading centers. The building is considered as one of the important Classical architecture constructions of <b>the</b> <b>city.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Sheriff's Police patrol {{services}} {{are often not}} required in incorporated <b>cities</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> such as Chicago have established their own police departments. The 500-600 member Sheriff's Police Department {{would not have the}} personnel necessary to supply full police services to all incorporated areas in Cook County especially in a municipality such as Chicago.|$|R
5000|$|... 2007: Following the 2003 Staten Island Ferry crash, Korman {{refused to}} allow New York City to cap its liability, holding that an obscure {{maritime}} law did not apply <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>City’s</b> managers had been negligent in disobeying a city rule requiring that two captains remain in the pilot house while the ferry was in motion.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the demise}} of Japanese naval power in the region, Kinkaid's Seventh Fleet {{supported}} the land campaigns in the Philippines and the Borneo. Kinkaid was promoted to admiral on 3 April 1945. After the Pacific War ended in August 1945, the Seventh Fleet assisted in landing troops in Korea and northern China to occupy these areas and repatriate Allied prisoners of war. Kinkaid elected not to land troops at Chefoo as originally instructed <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was {{in the hands of}} the Communist Eighth Route Army; Tsingtao was substituted instead. He was awarded the Legion of Merit by the theater commander in China, Lieutenant General Albert C. Wedemeyer, and the Grand Cordon of the Order of Precious Tripod by the Chinese government.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, to {{mark the}} seventh centenary {{of the birth of}} King James I, Gaudí {{designed}} a monument in his memory. It would have been situated in the Plaça del Rei, and would have also meant the renovation of the adjacent buildings: new roof for the cathedral, as well as the completion of its towers and cupola; placement of three vases above the buttresses of the Chapel of Santa Àgada, dedicated to the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary, as well as the figure of an angel on top of the chapel's tower; finally, the opening of a large square next to the walls (now the Plaça Ramon Berenguer el Grand). The project was not executed <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> council disliked it.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Denver {{became the}} first major city in the U.S. to vote to make the private {{possession}} of less than an ounce of marijuana legal for adults 21 and older. The city voted 53.5 percent {{in favor of the}} marijuana legalization measure, which, as then-mayor John Hickenlooper pointed out, was without effect, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> cannot usurp state law, which at that time treated marijuana possession {{in much the same way}} as a speeding ticket, with fines of up to $100 and no jail time. Denver passed an initiative in the fourth quarter of 2007 requiring the mayor to appoint an 11-member review panel to monitor the city's compliance with the 2005 ordinance. In 2012, Colorado Amendment 64 was signed into law by Governor John Hickenlooper and at the beginning of 2014 Colorado {{became the first}} state to allow the sale of marijuana for recreational use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> famous {{brand of}} Shumensko beer, the team are often affectionately called The Brewers.|$|R
50|$|Mile Run has {{stress on}} it <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> {{surrounding}} it, possibly harming the aquatic life.|$|R
50|$|There are {{different}} {{options available to}} these formats in London <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> iconic, Double-decker bus.|$|R
5|$|Oshii based {{the setting}} for Ghost in the Shell on Hong Kong. Oshii commented that his first thought to find {{an image of the}} future setting was an Asian city, but finding a {{suitable}} cityscape of the future would be impossible. Oshii chose to use the real streets of Hong Kong as his model. He also said that Hong Kong was the perfect subject and theme for the film with its countless signs and the cacophony of sounds. The film's mecha designer Takeuchi Atsushi noted that while the film does not have a chosen setting, it is obviously based on Hong Kong <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> represented the theme of the film, {{the old and the new}} which exist in a strange relationship in an age of an information deluge. Before shooting the film, the artists drew sketches that emphasized Hong Kong's chaotic, confusing and overwhelming aspects.|$|E
5|$|The second-ever Barbed Wire Massacre was {{the sixth}} match {{on the card}} between Abyss and Judas Mesias, who was {{accompanied}} by Father James Mitchell. Its duration was fourteen minutes and fifty-one seconds. It was featured from the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Greenville, SC refused to allow a match that violent to take place live. In Barbed Wire Massacre, the ring ropes are switched with strands of barbed-wire and several weapons are featured wrapped in barbed-wire. The match falls under no disqualifications rules and is won by either a pinfall or submission. Mesias bashed Abyss {{over the head with}} a barbed-wire wrapped chair, which caused Abyss to bleed from the forehead. Abyss performed his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver on Mitchell after he interfered in the bout. Abyss won the contest after using the Black Hole Slam to drop Mesias onto a barbed-wire wrapped board.|$|E
5|$|Yi chose Dan Fegan as {{his agent}} to {{represent}} {{him in the}} NBA draft and flew to Los Angeles to participate in pre-NBA draft camps. Before the draft, Yi was predicted {{by many to be}} picked anywhere from third to twelfth. On 28 June 2007, Yi was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the sixth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft, despite Fegan warning the Milwaukee Bucks not to pick Yi and not allowing them {{to be one of the}} teams invited to Yi's pre-draft private workouts in Los Angeles. Fegan did not want Milwaukee to select Yi <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Milwaukee did not have a large Asian-American community. However, Milwaukee's general manager Larry Harris said they had only drafted the best player available to them. Yi and Sun Yue together marked the first time in NBA draft history where two Chinese born players were selected in the same draft, which was a feat that would not be repeated again until 2016.|$|E
50|$|Greek geographers {{sometimes}} {{called it the}} river of Tartessus (<b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> that had <b>the</b> same name).|$|R
50|$|The Dunedin statue was {{the last}} of the set to be {{unveiled}} on 24 May 1887. A statue of Burns was deemed relevant to <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> both <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> Scottish roots (it was founded by the Free Church of Scotland in 1848), and also <b>because</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> founding fathers was Rev. Thomas Burns, a nephew of the poet.|$|R
500|$|The name of {{the arena}} was {{discussed}} during 2007, with Malmö Arena or Hyllie Arena discussed as potential options. The naming rights were eventually sold to Malmö Stad for 10 years in a deal worth 50 million kronor. Nilsson wished for the arena to have [...] "Malmö" [...] in its name <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> new association football stadium, Swedbank Stadion, did not.|$|R
