5000|$|To {{understand}} DB FROG, {{it helps}} to consider a particular FROG <b>beam</b> <b>geometry.</b> Here we consider the polarization-gate (PG) geometry. The modification required to turn a Blind PG FROG into Double Blind PG FROG is {{the addition of a}} pair of crossed polarizers and a spectrometer. The main idea behind DB FROG is that, when one pulse gates the other, the other must also gate the one. In Blind FROG (see Blind FROG schematic), the gated pulse 2 is simply dumped after the nonlinear medium. But in DB PG FROG (see Figure 2), it passes through a crossed polarizer and is spectrally resolved to generate a second FROG trace. In DB PG FROG, trace 1 is proportional to [...] where [...] and [...] are the two light pulse electric fields. This expression is identical to that in PG XFROG. Trace 2 is proportional to [...] where the roles of the two pulses are reversed. This term, of course, also has the form of a FROG trace produced by PG XFROG. The DB FROG retrieval algorithm uses information contained in both traces to retrieve both of the unknown pulses.|$|E

The {{linear attenuation}} coefficient and buildup factor, as well as several other properties, will be determined for MCP- 96 alloy to assess its use in radiation therapy. A narrow collimated beam of γ-rays from sources with varying energies will pass through various thicknesses of MCP- 96 alloy. The attenuation in the intensity of the beam will be determined for each varying thickness of the alloy. Plotting the thickness of the alloy versus the corresponding logarithmic intensity of the beam will allow calculation of the {{linear attenuation coefficient}}. The narrow <b>beam</b> <b>geometry</b> will then be replaced by the broad <b>beam</b> <b>geometry</b> to determine the buildup factor. Additional radiation is obtained through the broad <b>beam</b> <b>geometry</b> as a result of scattering and secondary radiation. Comparing the broad <b>beam</b> <b>geometry</b> to the narrow <b>beam</b> <b>geometry</b> allows determination of the buildup factor. Since the buildup factor depends upon the thickness of the MCP- 96 attenuator, the energy of the beam, and the source-to-attenuator (STA) distance, it will be calculated using three parameters. It will be calculated as a function of thickness of MCP- 96 alloy by using various thicknesses of the alloy; as a function of the energy of the incident radiation beam by using several sources with different beam energies; and finally, as a function of the source-to-attenuator distance by changing the position of the MCP- 96 attenuators.
