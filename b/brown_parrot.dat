5|$|The {{population}} of grey parrots described {{from the island}} of Réunion (referred to as Psittacula cf. bensoni by Hume) {{is thought to have}} been conspecific with that on Mauritius. Until subfossils of P. bensoni are found on Réunion, it cannot be confirmed whether the grey parrots of the two islands belonged to the same species. In the 1860s, French naturalists Charles Coquerel and Auguste Vinson suggested these could have been parrots of the genus Coracopsis, but fossils of neither that genus nor Psittacula have ever been found on Réunion. Whilst Coracopsis parrots are known to have been introduced to that island in the 1700s, a population did not become established. While no live or dead Mascarene grey parakeets are known with certainty to have been exported, Hume has suggested that a <b>brown</b> <b>parrot</b> specimen—once housed in Cabinet du Roi but now lost—may have been a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet, or perhaps a lesser vasa parrot (Coracopsis nigra). This specimen was described by Comte de Buffon in 1779.|$|E
50|$|Meyer's parrot or <b>brown</b> <b>parrot</b> (Poicephalus meyeri) is a smallish (about 21 cm, 90-130g) but stocky African parrot. Meyer's parrots {{display the}} black head, back and tail, green or blue-green abdomen, blue rump and bright yellow {{markings}} on the carpal joint of the wings. Most subspecies have some yellow {{on the top}} of the head as well. Forshaw (1989) recognizes six subspecies of P. meyeri which vary in home range, size and in markings, including the extent of yellow markings to the head and wings and the intensity of turquoise markings on the abdomen and rump. Its name commemorates the German ornithologist Bernhard Meyer.|$|E

50|$|The fruit are {{consumed}} by the Australian king <b>parrot,</b> <b>brown</b> cuckoo-dove, topknot pigeon, rose-crowned fruit-dove, wompoo fruit-dove, white-headed pigeon, green catbird and regent bowerbird in Australia.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fruit is}} a woody berry from 12 to 39 inches (30-100 cm) long [...] {{and up to}} seven inches (18 cm) broad, but eight inches (20 cm) has been reported. [...] Typically it weighs between 11 and 22 pounds (5 and 10 kg) but {{occasionally}} up to 26 pounds (12 kg), and hangs down on long, rope-like peduncles. The fruit pulp is fibrous and pulpy, and contains numerous seeds. It is eaten by several species of mammals, including baboons, bushpigs, savannah elephants, giraffes, hippopotamuses, monkeys, and porcupines. The seeds are dispersed in their dung. The seeds are also eaten by <b>brown</b> <b>parrots</b> and brown-headed parrots, and the foliage by elephants and greater kudu (Joffe 2003; del Hoyo et al. 1997). Introduced specimens in Australian parks are very popular with cockatoos. The trees are also found in large numbers in Ingraham Institute NH-24 campus, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh in India. Whether {{it is the same}} species has not yet been verified.|$|R

Nationally endangered red cross and Stuart Mill spider orchids are present. Animals recorded from the reserve include swift <b>parrots,</b> <b>brown</b> treecreepers, crested bellbirds, painted and black-chinned honeyeaters, fat-tailed dunnarts, lace monitors and woodland blind snakes.|$|R
50|$|As at July 2015, the Atlas of NSW Wildlife {{recorded}} 114 {{bird species}} within the reserve. The bird species listed as 'vulnerable' in New South Wales, {{recorded in the}} reserve, are the little eagle, gang-gang cockatoo, turquoise <b>parrot,</b> <b>brown</b> treecreeper, speckled warbler, varied sittella, hooded robin, scarlet robin, flame robin, and diamond firetail.|$|R

Endangered plants such as the MacNutt's wattle, velvet wattle and Torrington pea have been found here. The area {{is also home to}} endangered birds such as the glossy black-cockatoo, <b>brown</b> treecreeper, swift <b>parrot,</b> square-tailed kite and barking owl.

50|$|Street Corner Talking is {{the seventh}} studio album by the band Savoy <b>Brown.</b> Released by <b>Parrot</b> in 1971 (PAS 71047), {{it was the}} first album {{released}} by the band since the departure of Lonesome Dave, Roger Earl, and Tone Stevens who all went on to form the band Foghat. This left Kim Simmonds as the only remaining member on the group from the previous line-up. Simmonds recruited a fresh lineup of musicians, predominantly members of the previous line-up of Chicken Shack; which had undergone a seismic change in membership similar to that which had affected Savoy Brown; which, in turn, ushered in a new sound for the band.|$|R
40|$|Two commercially {{important}} mussel {{species are}} recorded from the Indian coast: green mussel Perna viridis (Linnaeus, 1758) and brown mussel P. indica (Kuriakose and Nair, 1976). Apart from this, a third type {{referred to as}} parrot mussel, which has shell shape of brown mussel, but with green shell colouration and suspected to be the hybrid of the above two species has also been reported from Kollam coast of Kerala, where both the species co-occur. In the present work, genetic identity of parrot and sympatric mussel species was determined using protein and genomic DNA markers. Protein markers viz. Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and allozymes and the genomic DNA marker Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) were used for determining genetic identity of the three mussel groups. The green and brown mussels could be clearly differentiated using SDS PAGE. The parrot mussel protein pattern {{was similar to that}} of brown mussel, except for an additional band of molecular weight 48. 7 Kda which is unique to brown mussel. Genus specific protein bands for Perna viz. 66 Kda, 43 Kda and 14. 3 Kda, were detected in this study. Allozyme electrophoresis also followed a similar pattern. Of the 10 allozyme loci studied, seven revealed speciesspecific diagnostic differences between P. viridis and P. indica. They were AAT- 1 * (Aspartate Amino Transferase- 1 *), AAT- 2 *, ME (Malic Enzyme) *, PGM- 2 *(Phospo Gluco Mutase- 2 *), EST- 1 * (Esterase- 1 *), EST- 2 *, IcDH* (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase) *. Parrot mussel shared all the alleles of brown mussel, and no hybrid pattern was observed. Species-specific alleles clearly differentiated green mussel from both <b>brown</b> and <b>parrot</b> mussel. The genetic distance of green mussel from brown mussel, estimated from allozyme data was 1. 1145 and with parrot mussel it was 1. 105. The genetic distance between <b>parrot</b> mussel and <b>brown</b> mussel was negligibly low (0. 0005). Using allozyme and RAPD data, the Nei’s Unbiased Measures of genetic distance were calculated and the dendograms prepared based on these values clearly depicted the separation of parrot mussel from green mussel as well as the close resemblance of <b>parrot</b> mussel with <b>brown</b> mussel. The higher gene flow (1. 1539) determined using RAPD marker also hints that <b>brown</b> and <b>parrot</b> mussel may be acting as single interbreeding population. Hence this study using molecular tools to test the genetic identity of parrot mussel has helped to conclude that parrot mussel is only a morphotype of brown mussel and not a true hybrid of the two...|$|R
