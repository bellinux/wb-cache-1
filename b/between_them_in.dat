5|$|The {{government}} was {{also involved in}} the provision of social, educational and cultural institutions to Belgian refugees. In 1942, the government sponsored the creation of the Belgian Institute in London to entertain the Belgian refugee community in London.

5|$|An Assisted Elopement is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Gladys and Charlie who meet {{each other on the}} train home and they become romantically interested in each other. It turns out their parents are friends and wish for them to get married, souring the relationship <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> a ploy to get their children to elope, the fathers become bitter enemies in public and the couple elopes much to their enjoyment and intention. A surviving film still shows several of members of the cast, including Frank H. Crane, Violet Heming, and Alphonse Ethier. The film was released on August 30, 1910 and saw a wide national release. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|At first glance, all the Buddha statues appear similar, {{but there}} is a subtle {{difference}} <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the mudras, or the position of the hands. There are five groups of mudra: North, East, South, West and Zenith, which represent the five cardinal compass points according to Mahayana. The first four balustrades have the first four mudras: North, East, South and West, of which the Buddha statues that face one compass direction have the corresponding mudra. Buddha statues at the fifth balustrades and inside the 72 stupas on the top platform have the same mudra: Zenith. Each mudra represents one of the Five Dhyani Buddhas; each has its own symbolism.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{displays}} features {{common to}} both birds and non-avian dinosaurs, Archaeopteryx {{has often been}} considered a link <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> the 1970s, John Ostrom, following Thomas Henry Huxley's lead in 1868, argued that birds evolved within theropod dinosaurs and Archaeopteryx was a critical piece of evidence for this argument; it had several avian features, such as a wishbone, flight feathers, wings, and a partially reversed first toe along with dinosaur and theropod features. For instance, it has a long ascending process of the ankle bone, interdental plates, an obturator process of the ischium, and long chevrons in the tail. In particular, Ostrom found that Archaeopteryx was remarkably similar to the theropod family Dromaeosauridae.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{geological}} {{layout of the}} Rhondda Valley, transport links are fairly restrictive. The original road layout followed the valleys with few connections <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> the 1920s, a major unemployment relief programme for out of work miners was created to build mountain roads connecting communities together. The mountain roads had a lasting effect and transformed the valleys from being dead-end communities. In the late 20th and early 21st century, new road projects such as the Rhondda by-pass have been created out of former railway lines.|$|E

The games add many new features, such as Internet play over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and changes to battle mechanics and Pokémon Contests, along with addition of 107 new Pokémon. The games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and while both can be played separately, {{it is necessary to}} trade <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> order to complete the games' Pokédexes.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City manager Brian Horton, {{his former}} captain at Luton, paid Portsmouth £750,000 for Walsh's {{services}} in March 1994. With star striker Niall Quinn out injured, City were fourth from bottom with eleven Premier League games left {{to play and}} Walsh's strike partner Uwe Rösler was also a new signing – and had yet to learn English. The pair soon built an understanding however, {{and the arrival of}} wingers Peter Beagrie and Nicky Summerbee gave City the attacking firepower to steer clear of the relegation zone as Walsh and Rösler scored nine goals <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the final ten games.|$|E
5|$|The algae are a polyphyletic {{group and}} {{are placed in}} various divisions, some {{more closely related to}} plants than others.

The algal division Charophyta, sister to the green algal division Chlorophyta, is considered to contain the ancestor of true plants. The Charophyte class Charophyceae and the land plant sub-kingdom Embryophyta together form the monophyletic group or clade Streptophytina.|$|E

5|$|The fort was {{initially}} commanded by Captain James Crane, with a garrison of ten men, including his second in command, a porter, six gunners and two soldiers. As time went on, {{not all of}} the gunners worked full-time at the fort, some living and working in the town itself. It is uncertain how many artillery pieces the blockhouse {{was initially}} equipped with, although it is known that the five blockhouses along the Thames had 108 brass and iron guns in total <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> 1540.|$|E
5|$|The {{right wing}} was {{commanded}} by Sir Thomas Fairfax, with John Lambert as his second in command. He {{had at least}} 2,000 horse from Yorkshire and Lancashire, deployed in nine divisions, with 600 musketeers posted <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> {{the same manner as}} on the left wing. There were also perhaps 500 dragoons. One regiment of Covenanter horse commanded by the Earl of Eglinton was deployed with Fairfax's front line, two more (one of them composed of lancers commanded by the Earl of Balgonie, Leven's son) were deployed behind Fairfax's second line. The second and third lines of the right wing may also have included some units of foot, whose identity is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{dominated}} by the West Indies bowlers Holding and Colin Croft, who claimed 41 wickets <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the series. England suffered an innings defeat in the first Test, and lost the third by 298 runs as they failed to register an innings of over 250 {{in the first three}} Tests. Strong batting performances and rain enabled England to draw the final two Tests, and so the series ended 2–0 to the West Indies.|$|E

5|$|Throughout much of {{the twentieth}} century, Venezuela was beset by political, civil and {{military}} unrest. After Juan Vicente Gómez's long reign as president ended in 1935, a series of military rulers followed, concluding with Marcos Pérez Jiménez's overthrow by general uprising in 1958. Although the military remained influential, Venezuela's government has since been chosen by civilians through democratic processes. Until 1998, the dominant political parties were Acción Democrática and COPEI, who shared seven presidencies <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> 1989, during the second term in office for Acción Democrática's Carlos Andrés Pérez, Venezuela {{was hit by a}} severe economic crisis.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1929 there were {{suggestions}} that the castle {{should be taken}} under French control. On 16November 1933 Krak des Chevaliers was given into {{the control of the}} French state, and cared for by the Académie des Beaux-Arts. The villagers were moved and paid F1million <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> compensation. Over the following two years a programme of cleaning and restoration was carried out by a force of 120workers. Once finished, Krak des Chevaliers was one of the key tourist attractions in the French Levant. Pierre Coupel, who had undertaken similar work at the Tower of the Lions and the two castles at Sidon, supervised the work. Despite the restoration, no archaeological excavations were carried out. The French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon, which had been established in 1920, ended in 1946 with the declaration of Syrian independence. The castle was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, along with Qal’at Salah El-Din, in 2006, and is owned by the Syrian government.|$|E
