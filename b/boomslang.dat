5|$|Predators {{include the}} leopard, serval, cats, the black-headed heron, dark {{chanting}} goshawk, African hawk-eagle and Wahlberg's eagle. In South Africa, newly hatched chicks {{were taken by}} a <b>boomslang.</b> If surprised, an African crake will leap vertically into the air before running away, a tactic believed to help it to evade snakes or terrestrial mammals.|$|E
5|$|Snake scales {{occur as}} a motif {{regularly}} in computer action games. A snake scale was portrayed as a clue in the 1982 film Blade Runner. Snake scales also figure in popular fiction, such as the Harry Potter series (desiccated <b>Boomslang</b> skin {{is used as a}} raw material for concocting the Polyjuice potion), and also in teen fiction.|$|E

25|$|Colubrids – <b>boomslangs,</b> tree snakes, vine snakes, {{mangrove}} snakes, {{although not}} all colubrids are venomous.|$|R
25|$|The <b>boomslang's</b> venom is {{the most}} potent of all rear-fanged snakes in the world based on LD50. Although its venom may be more potent than some vipers and elapids, it causes fewer {{fatalities}} owing to various factors (for example, the fangs' effectiveness is not high compared with many other snakes: the venom dose delivered is low, and <b>boomslangs</b> are generally less aggressive in comparison to other venomous snakes such as cobras and mambas).|$|R
25|$|<b>Boomslang</b> (Dispholidus typus) and twig snake (Thelotornis spp.) venom are {{toxic to}} blood cells and thin the blood (hemotoxic, hemorrhagic). Early {{symptoms}} include headaches, nausea, diarrhea, lethargy, mental disorientation, bruising and bleeding {{at the site}} and all body openings. Exsanguination is {{the main cause of}} death from such a bite.|$|E
25|$|Cobras, vipers, {{and closely}} related species use venom to {{immobilize}} or kill their prey. The venom is modified saliva, delivered through fangs. The fangs of 'advanced' venomous snakes like viperids and elapids are hollow to inject venom more effectively, while the fangs of rear-fanged snakes such as the <b>boomslang</b> merely have a groove on the posterior edge to channel venom into the wound. Snake venoms are often prey specific—their role in self-defense is secondary.|$|E
25|$|The Polyjuice Potion {{allows the}} drinker {{to assume the}} {{appearance}} of someone else {{for an hour or}} more depending on the quantity. The potion only causes a physical transformation of the drinker, but clothing and voice is not affected. Its ingredients include fluxweed, knotgrass, lacewing flies, leeches, powdered Bicorn horn, and shredded <b>Boomslang</b> skin. The final component is a bit of the individual to be impersonated; strands of hair are most often used for this purpose.|$|E
5000|$|Scrash also {{produced}} {{a number of}} remixes for other artists during this period - most notably two remixes (the first in a techno style, the second in a sample heavy industrial style) for the London based indie band <b>Boomslang's</b> [...] "Rage" [...] single.|$|R
50|$|<b>Boomslangs</b> are diurnal {{and almost}} {{exclusively}} arboreal. They are reclusive, and flee from anything {{too large to}} eat. Their diet includes chameleons and other arboreal lizards, frogs, and occasionally small mammals, birds, and eggs from nesting birds, all of which they swallow whole. During cool weather, they hibernate for moderate periods, often curling up inside the enclosed nests of birds such as weavers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Boomslangs</b> are oviparous, {{and produce}} up to 30 eggs which are {{deposited}} in hollow tree trunks or rotting logs. The eggs {{have a relatively}} long (three months on average) incubation period. Male hatchlings are grey with blue speckles, and female hatchlings are a pale brown. They attain their adult coloration after several years. Hatchlings are approximately 20 cm in length and pose no threat to humans, but are dangerously venomous {{by the time they}} reach a length of about 45 cm and a girth as thick as an adult's smallest finger.|$|R
25|$|There {{are also}} venomous {{colubrids}} in Africa, although of these only two arboreal genera, the <b>boomslang</b> and the twig snakes, {{are likely to}} inflict life-threatening bites. Of the Atractaspididae, Atractaspis is the species involved {{in the majority of}} bites. Since these snakes are nocturnal and fossorial, living in burrows underground, bites remain rare, peaking at 1 to 3% in certain areas of the Sudanian savanna. However, there is no antivenom or other effective therapy for Atractaspis envenomation, and the case fatality rate remains approximately 10%, with death typically occurring quickly.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000 Marr {{recruited}} drummer Zak Starkey (son of Ringo Starr), Cavewaves guitarist Lee Spencer {{and former}} Kula Shaker bassist Alonza Bevan {{for his new}} project, Johnny Marr and the Healers. The band had taken two years to come together as Marr had wanted members to be chosen [...] "by chemistry". Their debut album <b>Boomslang</b> was released in 2003, with all lyrics and lead vocals by Marr. A second album was originally scheduled for release in April 2005, and a short tour was expected soon after, but Marr has since stated that the band is on the [...] "side burner" [...] {{for the time being}} (Manchester Evening News, May 2007). Drummer Starkey is currently involved with the Who, and Bevan has regrouped with Kula Shaker.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Boomslang</b> {{strove to}} provide a {{platform}} for Lexington's left-of-center creative community, hosting a number [...] "satellite events" [...] organized by various local artists and organizations. In addition to those listed below, <b>Boomslang</b> hosted a Dorkbot workshop on D.I.Y. music instruments.|$|E
50|$|In this species, {{the head}} is {{distinct}} from the neck and the canthus rostralis is distinct. The pupils of the very large eyes are round. <b>Boomslangs</b> have excellent eyesight and often move their heads {{from side to side}} {{to get a better view}} of objects directly in front of them. The maxillary teeth are small anteriorly, seven or eight in number, followed by three very large, grooved fangs situated below each eye. The mandibular teeth are subequal. The body is slightly compressed. The dorsal scales are very narrow, oblique, strongly keeled, with apical pits, arranged in 19 or 21 rows. The tail is long, and the subcaudals are paired. Ventrals are 164-201; the anal plate is divided; and the subcaudals are 91-131.|$|R
50|$|The nests {{consist of}} {{separate}} chambers, {{each of which}} is occupied by a pair (sometimes with offspring) roost and breed. Nests are built around large and sturdy structures like acacia trees or sometimes even telephone poles. The trees generally used for nest-building are Acacia erioloba, Boscia albitrunca and Aloe dichotoma. The birds at Etosha National Park also use Colophospermum mopane trees for nesting. Large nesting colonies can be active across many generations, sometimes over a hundred years. The nest appears like a large haystack in the tree. If seen from below, entrances into the chambers may be seen, giving a honey-comb appearance. The entrances may be about 3 in wide and can be up to 10 in long. Sharp sticks may be placed to deter predators from entering. Snakes, especially Cape cobras and <b>boomslangs</b> are the most common nest predators, often consuming all the eggs in all the chambers of a large nest. Nest predation is often as high - in one study 70% of the clutches laid were depredated.|$|R
50|$|He, {{along with}} Cobra and Copperhead, were sent by Viper to poison the water supply, turning civilians into snake creatures. They were {{eventually}} found out by Diamondback and Captain America, and <b>Boomslang</b> was quickly {{taken care of}} by Captain America's shield. During the battle against the X-Men, he went up against Wolverine, who defeated him quite easily. He was later sent by the group to watch over Diamondback, but when Captain America discovered his presence, <b>Boomslang</b> ran and was eventually gunned down by a group of teenage thugs. Captain America immediately rushed <b>Boomslang</b> to the hospital. During the AIM Weapons Expo, <b>Boomslang</b> was seen among the several villains attending the fighting tournament between many super heroes and villains.|$|E
