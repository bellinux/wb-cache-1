25|$|The most {{dramatic}} {{depiction of the}} catastrophe was Leon Bakst’s “Ancient Terror” (Terror Antiquus, 1908), although it does not name Atlantis directly. It is a mountain-top view of a rocky bay breached by the sea, which is washing inland about the tall structures of an ancient city. A streak of lightning crosses {{the upper half of}} the painting, while below it rises the impassive figure of an enigmatic goddess who holds a blue dove <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts.</b> Vyacheslav Ivanov identified the subject as Atlantis in a public lecture on the painting given in 1909, the year it was first exhibited, and he has been followed by other commentators in the years since.|$|E

2500|$|Mami Wata {{is often}} {{described}} as a mermaid-like figure, with a woman's upper body (often nude) and the hindquarters of a fish or serpent. In other tales, Mami Wata is fully human in appearance (though never human). The existence and spiritual importance of Mami Wata is deeply rooted in the ancient tradition and mythology of the coastal southeastern Nigerians (Efik, Ibibio and Annang people). [...] Mami Wata often carries expensive baubles such as combs, mirrors, and watches. A large snake (symbol of divination and divinity) frequently accompanies her, wrapping itself around her and laying its head <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts.</b> Other times, she may try to pass as completely human, wandering busy markets or patronising bars. She may also manifest {{in a number of other}} forms, including as a man. Traders in the 20th century carried similar beliefs with them from Senegal to as far as Zambia. As the Mami Wata traditions continues to re-emerge, native water deities were subsumed into it.|$|E

And his seared, ruined membrane relaxed, softened, that which was seared and stiff and blasted yielded again, became soft and flexible, palpitating with new life.

60|$|So she withdrew {{away from}} Gudrun {{and from that}} which she stood for, she turned in spirit towards Birkin again. She had not seen him since the fiasco of his proposal.

And she was not at all sure that {{this was the kind of}} love that she herself wanted. She was not at all sure that it was this mutual unison in separateness that she wanted. She wanted unspeakable intimacies. She wanted to have him, utterly, finally to have him as her own, oh, so unspeakably, in intimacy. To drink him down--ah, like a life-draught. She made great professions, to herself, of her willingness to warm his foot-soles <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts,</b> after the fashion of the nauseous Meredith poem. But only on condition that he, her lover, loved her absolutely, with complete self-abandon. And subtly enough, she knew he would never abandon himself FINALLY to her. He did not believe in final self-abandonment. He said it openly. It was his challenge. She was prepared to fight him for it. For she believed in an absolute surrender to love. She believed that love far surpassed the individual. He said the individual was MORE than love, or than any relationship. For him, the bright, single soul accepted love as one of its conditions, a condition of its own equilibrium. She believed that love was EVERYTHING. Man must render himself up to her. He must be quaffed to the dregs by her. Let him be HER MAN utterly, and she in return would be his humble slave--whether she wanted it or not.|$|E

[...] The name of the one (let it sound as it will) was John Hewet; of [...] the other Sarah Drew. John was a well-set man, about [...] five-and-twenty; Sarah, a brave woman of eighteen. John had for [...] several months borne the labour of the day in the same field with [...] Sarah; when she milked, it was his morning and evening charge to [...] bring the cows to her pails. Their love was the talk, but not the [...] scandal, of the whole neighbourhood, for all they aimed at was the [...] blameless possession of each other in marriage. It was but this [...] very morning that he had obtained her parents’ consent, and it was [...] but till the next week that they were to wait to be happy.

While they were thus employed (it was on the last of [...] July), a terrible storm of thunder and lightning arose, that drove [...] the labourers to what shelter the trees or hedges afforded. Sarah, [...] frightened and out of breath, sunk on a hay-cock; and John (who [...] never separated from her) sat by her side, having raked two or [...] three heaps together, to secure her. Immediately, there was heard [...] so loud a crash, as if heaven had burst asunder. The labourers, [...] all solicitous for each other’s safety, called to one another: [...] those that were nearest our lovers, hearing no answer, stepped to [...] the place where they lay: they first saw a little smoke, and [...] after, this faithful pair—John, with one arm about his Sarah’s [...] neck, and the other held over her face, as if to screen her from [...] the lightning. They were struck dead, and already grown stiff and [...] cold in this tender posture.

Lays have I left of such a dear delight That maids will sing them on their bridal night. Gay villagers, upon a morn of May When they have tired their gentle limbs, with play, And form'd a snowy circle on the grass, And plac'd in midst of all that lovely lass Who chosen is their queen,--with her fine head Crowned with flowers purple, white, and red: For there the lily, and the musk-rose, sighing, Are emblems true of hapless lovers dying: <b>Between</b> <b>her</b> <b>breasts,</b> that never yet felt trouble, A bunch of violets full blown, and double, Serenely sleep:--she from a casket takes A little book,--and then a joy awakes About each youthful heart,--with stifled cries, And rubbing of white hands, and sparkling eyes: For she's to read a tale of hopes, and fears; One that I foster'd in my youthful years: The pearls, that on each glist'ning circlet sleep, Gush ever and anon with silent creep, Lured by the innocent dimples. To sweet rest Shall the dear babe, upon its mother's breast, Be lull'd with songs of mine. Fair world, adieu!

At times, 'tis true, I've felt relief from pain When some bright thought has darted through my brain: Through all that day I've felt a greater pleasure Than if I'd brought to light a hidden treasure. As to my sonnets, though none else should heed them, I feel delighted, still, that you should read them. Of late, too, I have had much calm enjoyment, Stretch'd on the grass at my best lov'd employment Of scribbling lines for you. These things I thought While, in my face, the freshest breeze I caught. E'en now I'm pillow'd {{on a bed of}} flowers That crowns a lofty clift, which proudly towers Above the ocean-waves. The stalks, and blades, Chequer my tablet with their, quivering shades.

And on the other side, outspread, is seen Ocean's blue mantle streak'd with purple, and green. Now 'tis I see a canvass'd ship, and now Mark the bright silver curling round her prow. I see the lark down-dropping to his nest. And the broad winged sea-gull never at rest; For when no more he spreads his feathers free, His breast is dancing on the restless sea. Now I direct my eyes into the west, Which at this moment is in sunbeams drest: Why westward turn? 'Twas but to say adieu! 'Twas but to kiss my hand, dear George, to you! ...|$|E

5|$|The Royal Academy {{exhibition}} brought Fuseli and {{his painting}} enduring fame. The exhibition included Shakespeare-themed works by Fuseli, which won him {{a commission to}} produce eight paintings for publisher John Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery. One version of The Nightmare hung {{in the home of}} Fuseli's close friend and publisher Joseph Johnson, gracing his weekly dinners for London thinkers and writers. The Nightmare was widely plagiarised, and parodies of it were commonly used for political caricature, by George Cruikshank, Thomas Rowlandson, and others. In these satirical scenes, the incubus afflicts subjects such as Napoleon Bonaparte, Louis XVIII, British politician Charles James Fox, and Prime Minister William Pitt. In another example, admiral Lord Nelson is the demon, and his mistress Emma, Lady Hamilton, the sleeper. While some observers have viewed the parodies as mocking Fuseli, {{it is more likely that}} The Nightmare was simply a vehicle for ridicule of the caricatured subject. The Danish painter, Nicolai Abraham Abildgaard, whom Fuseli had met in Rome, produced his own version of The Nightmare (Danish: Mareridt) which develops on the eroticism of Fuseli's work. Abildgaard's painting shows two naked women asleep in the bed; it is the woman in the foreground who is experiencing the nightmare and the incubus — which is crouched on the woman's stomach, facing her parted legs — has its tail nestling <b>between</b> <b>her</b> exposed <b>breasts.</b>|$|R
