On the left side there is the photo. On other places there might optionally be a national identification number, the height and security features.

Newer EEA passports contain a Machine-readable zone, which contains the name, nationality and most other information from the identification page. It is designed in a way so that computers can fairly easily read the information, although it still human readable, since it contains only letters (A-Z), digits and [...] "<" [...] as space character, but no bar graph or similar. Apostrophes and similar have to be omitted, but hyphens and spaces should be replaced by an angle bracket. Diacritical marks are not permitted in the MRZ. Even though they may be useful to distinguish names, the use of diacritical marks in the MRZ could confuse machine-reading equipment.|$|E
40|$|The {{consequences}} of the Nazi-power for the scientific process are described qualitatively in various articles and books. However, recent progress in information systems allows a quantitative reflection. Literature databases ranging {{back to the beginning}} of the 20 th century, the ISI citation indexes ranging back to 1945 now and sophisticated search systems are suitable tools for this purpose. In this study the overall break in the scientific productivity and that of selected physical journals are examined. An overview of the citation impact of some 50 leading physicists is given. The productivity before and after departure is analyzed and connected to <b>biographical</b> <b>data.</b> Comment: 8 <b>pages,</b> 10 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
