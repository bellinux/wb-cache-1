5|$|By {{early on}} August 27, the {{tropical}} storm became slightly better organized, although {{the most intense}} winds were still removed from the center. Danny peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1006 mbar (hPa; 29.71 inHg). It held this strength for about 12 hours before wind shear caused the storm to gradually weaken as it meandered northward. By August 28, Danny further deteriorated, and reconnaissance aircraft {{found that it was}} <b>barely</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm. After stalling during the afternoon, the center resumed a north or north-northwestward drift.|$|E
5|$|Having firmly {{assisted}} {{and supported}} {{her husband on}} his path to political greatness, she suddenly died in 1890, aged 39, leaving him, distraught and bereft of her support, to achieve the political destiny which she had plotted. His premiership of the United Kingdom was shambolic, and lasted <b>barely</b> <b>a</b> year. For over thirty years following her death, he wandered in a political wilderness, directionless and exceedingly eccentric, until his own death in 1929.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, {{the storm}} {{deteriorated}} in organization as it continued northward. The lack of banding features indicated that by early on July 22, Becky was <b>barely</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm. The storm made landfall near Port St. Joe, Florida shortly thereafter, and weakened rapidly {{as it moved}} inland; as a rainstorm, it progressed northward into the Midwestern United States and completely dissipated over Michigan.|$|E

Samuel Taylor Coleridge did a lot of fellwalking during the years when he lived near Keswick.

5|$|The final {{fight of}} Johnson's early period, {{during which the}} stake money was {{relatively}} low, was his comprehensive win over a ponderous fighter called Fry for a prize of 50guineas at Kingston. The fight, which lasted less than 30minutes, ended with Fry badly beaten up and Johnson with <b>barely</b> <b>a</b> scratch on him. This fight did not attract many supporters of the sport; it took place on 6June 1786 and was therefore during the period when the wealthy were away from London.|$|E
5|$|Another {{high-profile}} clash came {{more than}} 20 years later, {{in the final}} of the FA Cup on 12 May 1979. A capacity crowd saw Arsenal take a 2–0 lead in the first half thanks to goals from Brian Talbot and Frank Stapleton, and with just five minutes left on the clock their lead was still intact. Then, in the 86th minute, Gordon McQueen pulled a goal back for United, and two minutes later they equalised with a goal from Sammy McIlroy. However, <b>barely</b> <b>a</b> minute after United equalised, Arsenal's Alan Sunderland scored an 89th-minute goal to win the cup 3–2 for Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|At the 2013 inquest {{into the}} roof {{collapse}} (see Government reaction below), testimony {{has revealed that}} many unpublicized structural problems at the mall dated {{all the way back}} to its initial construction in the late 1970s. In particular, the expansion joint above the escalators, the failure of which appears to have caused the roof deck collapse, was already not properly binding to the concrete, in turn allowing water to seep into the building's seams, as early as 1981 — <b>barely</b> <b>a</b> year after the mall's original opening. The expansion joint was fixed many times, and fully replaced twice, during the building's lifetime, yet always began tearing away from the concrete again shortly after the repairs were complete.|$|E
5|$|Duke Nukem Forever {{was officially}} {{announced}} on April 28, 1997, {{with the intention}} of releasing the game no later than mid-1998. <b>Barely</b> <b>a</b> year after the release of Duke Nukem 3D, the game's graphics and its game engine, the Build engine, were antiquated. Id Software's new Quake II engine was far superior to Build, so Broussard decided to license it. The price spent for the licensing rights was steep—estimates were as high as $500,000—but Broussard reasoned that it would save time used to write a game engine from scratch. Broussard and Miller were flush with cash from the sales of Duke Nukem 3D and other games, so they decided to fund Duke Nukem Forever themselves, turning marketing and publishing rights over to GT Interactive.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 11, Hernan was {{downgraded}} to {{a tropical}} storm. Deep convection diminished around {{the center of}} the storm and by August 12, almost all of the deep convection dissipated as Hernan continued to weaken. Over 23°C water, only a swirl of clouds remained and the storm was <b>barely</b> <b>a</b> tropical system. Later that night, Hernan had degenerated into a remnant low, and the final advisory was issued by the National Hurricane Center. The remnant low still retained tropical storm-force winds for a short while before weakening further by the next morning. The low moved towards the west-southwest over the next several days before dissipating 460mi (740km) southeast of the Island of Hawaii on August 16. The remnant low-pressure area of Hernan later brought moisture to the island of Hawaii, causing cloud and shower activity. The associated rainfall was light and insignificant.|$|E

5|$|Lord Cave {{resigned}} on 28 March 1928 due to ill health, {{and died}} the day after. His replacement was Lord Hailsham, {{who was appointed}} by Stanley Baldwin on 29 March 1928. Hailsham's first tenure as Lord Chancellor lasted <b>barely</b> <b>a</b> year and highlighted the fact that despite his abilities (many politicians considered {{that if he had}} not accepted the offer to become Lord Chancellor he would likely have become Prime Minister) he was not a particularly innovative Lord Chancellor. For a short period in August 1928 he acted as Prime Minister (Baldwin was on holiday in Aix-en-Provence) with Schuster as his chief adviser, but he rarely went to 10 Downing Street and nothing eventful happened during his time in charge.|$|E
5|$|The 1981 Entumbane uprising, {{also known}} as the Battle of Bulawayo or Entumbane II, {{occurred}} between 8 and 12 February 1981 in and around Bulawayo, Zimbabwe amid political tensions in the newly independent state. Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) guerrillas, mainly in the city's western suburb of Entumbane, rebelled, creating a situation that threatened to develop into a fresh civil war, <b>barely</b> <b>a</b> year {{after the end of the}} Bush War. The Rhodesian African Rifles (RAR) and other white-commanded elements of the former Rhodesian Security Forces, fighting for the Zimbabwean government as part of the new Zimbabwe National Army, put down the uprising. Groups of Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) fighters attacked both ZIPRA and the government forces during the revolt, which followed a smaller outbreak of fighting between guerrillas in November 1980.|$|E
5|$|Although Arsenal {{was founded}} in 1886, {{it was not until}} 1897 that the club {{appointed}} a permanent manager in charge of first-team affairs, with Thomas Mitchell universally recognised as Arsenal's first professional manager. Mitchell joined Arsenal five months after resigning from Blackburn Rovers in October 1896. The Scotsman's time at Woolwich Arsenal was brief and he left his post <b>barely</b> <b>a</b> year into his contract, though he did manage to take the club from tenth to fifth in the league. Mitchell guided Arsenal through a respectable cup run which culminated in the first round proper. William Elcoat succeeded Mitchell as manager in April 1898, and set about reviving the squad with new additions. The changes did not have the desired effect; his team finished seventh in a league of 18 and were beaten 6–0 by Derby County in the FA Cup first round. He departed in February 1899, and like his predecessor only remained for a season.|$|E

5|$|An {{ill-defined}} tropical wave {{entered the}} eastern Pacific on August1 and steadily organized to attain tropical depression intensity eight days later. Within {{an environment of}} light shear, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Flossie at 0000UTC on August9 and continued to organize to attain Category1 hurricane intensity by 1200UTC the following day as an eye became apparent on satellite. Continuing westward and crossing into the central Pacific basin, the system began a period of rapid intensification that brought it to its peak intensity with winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 949mb (hPa; 28.03inHg) at 0000UTC on September12, while positioned roughly 980mi (1575km) east-southeast of the Big Island. Increased wind shear the next day caused Flossie to begin a slow weakening trend thereafter; at 1200UTC on September14, the system weakened to a Category2 hurricane, and by 0600UTC on September15, the cyclone was <b>barely</b> <b>a</b> Category1 hurricane. Six hours later, it weakened to a tropical storm as the low-level center became exposed on satellite. Flossie weakened to a tropical depression early on September16 and dissipated by 1800UTC.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barely</b> <b>a</b> {{month later}} on 18 August 1851, Juan Manuel de Rosas, {{dictator}} of the Argentine Confederation, {{declared war on}} Brazil, beginning the Platine War. Marques de Sousa had been warned by Caxias as early as 27 July 1844 {{of the possibility of}} an armed conflict between Brazil and its Platine neighbor. The government in Rio de Janeiro had prepared against the threat and formed an anti-Rosas alliance consisting of Brazil, Uruguay and dissident Argentine provinces. Caxias, who had been appointed commander-in-chief of Brazilian land forces, placed Marques de Sousa {{at the head of the}} 2nd Brigade, part of the 2nd Division. The Brazilian army crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. On 17 November, while the army was camped in the village of Santa Lucía near the Uruguayan capital, Marques de Sousa was promoted to a higher command, the 1st division. The choice was controversial, as there were two more senior and experienced officers next in line who were bypassed owing to their foreign birth.|$|E
5|$|His {{first full}} season from 1940–1941 saw him play in eight matches, scoring 413runs with the bat at 29.50 and passing fifty runs in an innings twice. His first match was away against Queensland where he scored 22 and 45, making three stumpings, taking one catch and {{performing}} one run out, followed by scores {{of one and}} 33 in the home match, together with two stumpings. He scored 35 and four at home against Victoria, and then 45 in the second innings of the away match. On 22 November 1940, <b>barely</b> <b>a</b> year into Saggers' career, New South Wales faced a combined Queensland-Victoria team at Brisbane. Saggers scored 58 as his team reached 429 {{in response to the}} oppositions 202 all out. In the Queensland-Victoria team's second innings, where they reached 416, Saggers equalled the world record for most dismissals in an innings, taking seven catches. Saggers then went on to score 47 against South Australia, and 68 against Queensland on 1 January 1941. In his final match before the outbreak of World War II, Saggers scored 63 runs against South Australia. He ended the season with 18 catches with the gloves and 13stumpings.|$|E

5|$|On 13 July 744, Nasr {{captured}} and imprisoned al-Kirmani. After <b>barely</b> <b>a</b> month, the latter escaped, and his rebellion was joined {{not only by}} Azd soldiers, but also {{by many of the}} Arab settlers around Marv. A tentative truce was initially agreed upon, during which fruitless negotiations were conducted, but after Yazid reconfirmed Nasr in his post, al-Kirmani and the Yemenis—in reality, al-Kirmani's followers included other tribes as well, including most of the Syrians and even some Mudaris, but they were collectively called yamaniyya in the sources—resumed their revolt. Nasr in turn tried to strengthen his own position by enlisting the services of al-Harith ibn Surayj, al-Kirmani's one-time adversary, who enjoyed considerable support among some Arab tribes and especially his native Tamimis. When Ibn Surayj arrived at Merv in July 745 he was enthusiastically received by the town's inhabitants. Scorning Nasr's proposals for cooperation, Ibn Surayj soon withdrew to the countryside and rose in rebellion as well. Ibn Surayj was also able to exploit the unpopularity of Marwan II among the Mudaris and Nasr's followers, even though Nasr recognized him as the legitimate Caliph in exchange for his own confirmation to his post. Exploiting this resentment, Ibn Surayj soon gathered around him an army of over 3,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Pepper Rodgers {{was hired}} soon after Fulcher quit. Rodgers was hired {{away from the}} UCLA Bruins and like Carson and Fulcher, simply could not return Tech to its {{national}} prominence of Dodd's era, and after six seasons, Rodgers had accumulated only 34 wins and <b>barely</b> <b>a</b> 50% winning percentage. Rodgers flamboyant demeanor shortened his welcome at the school, and Athletic Director Doug Weaver, replaced him with Bill Curry. Homer Rice became Athletic Director, and attempted to reinvigorate Tech's program by joining the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1980. The Georgia Tech football program reached its lowest point in modern history after the hiring of Bill Curry, who had no experience as a head coach, but was a refreshing change after the flamboyant Rodgers. Curry's first two Tech teams from 1980–1981 went 2-19-1 with the only bright spots being a brilliant 24-21 victory over Bear Bryant's Alabama team at Legion Field to open the 1981 season and a 3-3 slug fest in 1980 with then No.1 rated Notre Dame at Grant Field. Things had gotten so bad, they could only get better. He slowly rebuilt the team, restored a winning mentality to the Georgia Tech fan base, and in 1985 Tech won 9 games, including a 17-14 victory over Michigan State in the All American Bowl.|$|E
