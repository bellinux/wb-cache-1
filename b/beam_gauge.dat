Pressing down the shot button causes the blue <b>beam</b> <b>gauge</b> to fill up, and releasing the button causes a wave beam to travel a certain distance depending {{on the length of}} time the button was pressed down. If the button is pressed down until the blue gauge is fully charged, a red gauge appears and fills up quickly. Filling up the red gauge causes it to flash blue and red, releasing the shot button at this point shoots an even more powerful beam.|$|E
40|$|Beam gauges {{have been}} used in {{the last decade or so}} for {{measuring}} the internal azimuthal compressive coil stresses in superconducting magnets. In early model Large Hadron Collider Interaction Region (LHC IR) quadrupoles tested at Fermilab, the beam gauges indicated excessively high amounts of inner and outer coil prestress during the collaring process, inconsistent with the coil size and modulus data. In response to these measurements, a simple mechanics based quantitative understanding of different factors affecting beam gauges has been developed. A finite element model with contact elements and non-linear material behavior, confirmed with experimental results, was developed. The results indicate that a small plastic deformation of either the beam or the backing plate can cause significant errors in the measured stress values. The effect of variations in coil modulus and support boundary conditions on <b>beam</b> <b>gauge</b> performance are also discussed. (3 refs) ...|$|E

The major challenge is handling these gauges is slightly difficult compared to other bore gauges. It should be lightweight, have low coefficient of thermal expansion, high modulus and stiffness. Mostly we use low carbon fiber or aluminium. It has stem with ball at both ends. The length range of the stem depends upon {{the width of the}} part. [...] In order to measure the diameter of the bore, place the beam at one end and slide the other end on the diameter and watch the dial indicator. The values initially increases and at one point starts decreasing; stop that point, it is called max point on the circle. That is the diameter of the component. Repeat the procedure in 3 different places and get the average value of the diameter of the component. This is the most common way to measure the larger bore. It is available in different ranges; normally you can use this from 300 mm to 4000 mm for external diameter.|$|R

40|$|A {{steel frame}} is {{designed}} to measure the existing prestressing force in the concrete beams and slabs when embedded inside the concrete members. The steel frame {{is designed to}} work on the principles of a vibrating wire strain gauge and in the present study is referred to as a vibrating <b>beam</b> strain <b>gauge</b> (VBSG). The existing strain in the VBSG is evaluated using both frequency data on the stretched member and static strain corresponding to a fixed static load, measured using electrical strain gauges. The evaluated strain in the VBSG corresponds to the existing stain in the concrete surrounding the prestressing strands. The crack reopening load method is used to compute the existing prestressing force in the concrete members and is then compared with the existing prestressing force obtained from the VBSG at that section. Digital image correlation based surface deformation and change in neutral axis monitored by putting electrical strain gauges across the cross section, are used to compute the crack reopening load accurately.

To reach the physics goals, the RPs will finally have to approach the beams to distances of 15 beam σs (i. e. ~ 1. 5 mm) or closer.

The eigenenergies and wavefunctions of a single atom have been calculated by computational methods. In addition, the ground-state energies, wavefunctions and spin current of many-body systems, in which the non-linear Gross-Pitaevskii particle-particle interaction is included, have been found. Comparing the result of a many-body system and those in the single particle system, the wavefunctions of the many-body system spread over a larger region than that in the single particle system, causing a significant difference in their spin current density.

40|$|We {{employ the}} exact diagonalization method {{to analyze the}} {{possibility}} of generating strongly correlated states in two-dimensional clouds of ultracold bosonic atoms which are subjected to a geometric gauge field created by coupling two internal atomic states to a laser <b>beam.</b> Tuning the <b>gauge</b> field strength, the system undergoes stepwise transitions between different ground states, which we describe by analytical trial wave functions, amongst them the Pfaffian, the Laughlin, and a Laughlin quasiparticle many-body state. The adiabatic following {{of the center of}} mass movement by the lowest energy dressed internal state, is lost by the mixing of the second internal state. This mixture can be controlled by the intensity of the laser field. The non-adiabaticity is inherent to the considered setup, and is shown {{to play the role of}} circular asymmetry. We study its influence on the properties of the ground state of the system. Its main effect is to reduce the overlap of the numerical solutions with the analytical trial expressions by occupying states with higher angular momentum. Thus, we propose generalized wave functions arising from the Laughlin and Pfaffian wave function by including components, where extra Jastrow factors appear, while preserving important features of these states. We analyze quasihole excitations over the Laughlin and generalized Laughlin states, and show that they possess effective fractional charge and obey anyonic statistics. Finally, we study the energy gap over the Laughlin state as the number of particles is increased keeping the chemical potential fixed. The gap is found to decrease as the number of particles is increased, indicating that the observability of the Laughlin state is restricted to a small number of particles.

40|$|An {{instrument}} {{to measure the}} momentum flux (total pressure) of plasma and neutral particle jets onto a surface has been developed. While this instrument was developed for magnetized plasmas, the concept works for non-magnetized plasmas as well. We have measured forces as small as 10 (exp - 4) Newtons on a surface immersed in the plasma where small forces are due to ionic and neutral particles with kinetic energies {{on the order of}} a few eV impacting the surface. This instrument, a force sensor, uses a target plate (surface) that is immersed in the plasma and connected to one end of an alumina rod while {{the opposite end of the}} alumina rod is mechanically connected to a titanium beam on which four strain gauges are mounted. The force on the target generates torque causing strain in the beam. The resulting strain measurements can be correlated to a force on the target plate. The alumina rod electrically and thermally isolates the target plate from the strain <b>gauge</b> <b>beam</b> and allows the strain gauges to be located out of the plasma flow while also serving as a moment arm of several inches to increase the strain in the beam at the strain gauge location. These force measurements correspond directly to momentum flux and may be used with known plasma conditions to place boundaries on the kinetic energies of the plasma and neutral particles. The force measurements may also be used to infer thrust produced by a plasma propulsive device. Stainless steel, titanium, molybdenum, and aluminum flat target plates have been used.

This paper presents a methodology {{for the design of}} a micromachined force gauge under uncertainty, in which the measured force and the maximum stress in the <b>beams</b> in the <b>gauge</b> are related to five uncertain design parameters representing the dimensions of the beam, the material property and the deflection of the beam under the force being measured. A deterministic large-deflection beam model is combined with a sampling-based stochastic model to obtain the distributions of the measured force and the maximum stress corresponding to the interactive influence of the uncertainty in the five design parameters. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the force measurement accuracy subject to a constraint on the maximum allowable stress. On the basis of the optimization results, design windows for the deflection and the force that maximize the accuracy are derived as functions of the uncertainties in the design parameters. The results provide directly usable information on the optimum geometric design of the force gauge for given uncertainties in the manufacturing and operation of the device.

In seismic performance assessment of these typical non - conforming buildings, collapse safety might be significantly affected by non - linear behavior of joints th at {{are involved in}} the failure mechanism, especially if they are characterized by poor structural detailing, such as the lack of an adequate transverse reinforcement i n the joint panel. Few reliable approaches for modeling all sources of nonlinearity are p roposed in literature for poorly designed beam - column joints because of relatively poor information from experimental tests. Even if a quite significant amount of research on seismic performance of unreinforced joints has been carried out in last years, a very few portion of them handled with specimens with plain hook - ended longitudinal bars. A small number of experimental results include also the analysis of local aspects, such as the evaluation of joint shear strain. Therefore, a higher number of tests is necessary to deeper understand joint seismic response in order to validate the existing models or calibrate new ones. The current study aims at improving the understanding of seismic performance of exterior joints without transverse reinforcement in non - c onforming RC buildings through experimental tests. Four full - scale exterior unreinforced beam - column joint sub - assemblages are tested under cyclic loading. The specimens are different for beam longitudinal reinforcement ratio and for typology of longitudin al bars (plain or deformed). Two different kinds of joint failure are expected, with or without the yielding of the adjacent <b>beam.</b> Strain <b>gauges</b> located on <b>beam</b> bars and displacement transducers on the joint panel allow the complete definition of both the main deformability contributions, namely fixed - end - rotation and shear strain of joint panel, highlighting the difference between the observed failure modes.

From the analy sis of the global experimental responses, i t is observed that the higher the beam longitudinal reinforcement ratio, the higher the joint shear strength, and that t he post - peak degrading behavior is always controlled by the response of the joint panel. The analysis of local responses highlighted that the sum of the main deformability contributions due to joints (joint panel shear strain and rotation at beam/joint interface) represents the major part of the imposed drift for all tests. In particular, in tests for which the beam reaches the yielding moment, the contribution of the deformation mechanism associated to the rotation at beam - joint interface is predominant, particularly in the case of plain longitudinal reinforcement...|$|R
40|$|A {{vacuum gripper}} {{is used to}} lift hard, flat objects such as boards, doors and metal discs. The gripper {{reviewed}} in particular {{can be viewed as}} a beam construction consisting of three parallel beams combined with a fourth beam orthogonal to the first three. On each end of the three parallel beams there is a vacuum cup, adding up to a total of six cups. The aim of this report was to analyze the strength of a ProWood Maxi with tilt by Lifts All AB made of steel with a yield strength of 355 MPa and to further develop it. The development process of the gripper aimed to produce a concept of a steering or warning system to prevent undesired tilts of the gripper to avoid injuries on the user as well as damages on the load. A requirement on the construction was an ability to be able to withstand a load of 200 kg. The project was restricted to only analyze the beam construction of the gripper with the main focus on the stresses and deformations. Calculations were performed including free body diagrams, force and torque equilibria as well as shear force and internal torque diagrams. Following this, computer analyses were done with the aim to find more realistic forces on the vacuum cups by letting those stay fixed and apply forces on the suspension devices corresponding to 200 kg. These forces were then used to analyze the stresses and deformations of the construction using ANSYS. For the concept of steering and warning system, strain gauges were placed on the <b>beam</b> construction. These <b>gauges</b> image the distribution of the load on the gripper and prevents usage if the load exceeds predefined critical values. The results of the analysis showed that the maximum stresses were about 50 MPa and that the maximum deformations in the steel construction ended up at 2. 3 mm. In conclusion, the total deformation of the steel construction is small compared to the deformation in the elastic vacuum cups. The steel construction will be able to hold a load of 200 kg with a safety factor of n= 7 considering the yield strength of the steel. It is also possible to enable a simple control system to prevent undesired tilting using strain gauges via a warning system, however using an active balance system would not be practical...|$|R
