5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the attack, 82 men trapped in the upturned hull were rescued <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> through the bottom hull plates. Figures for the death toll vary from approximately 950 to 1,204. Approximately 200 survivors of the sinking were transferred to the heavy cruiser Lützow in January 1945.|$|E
5|$|Small meadow of tall ruderal herbs, {{changing}} {{with natural}} succession, held back <b>by</b> <b>cutting,</b> with {{plants such as}} cow parsley, hogweed, stinging nettle, false oat-grass, garden escape daffodils and irises.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{hoped to}} weaken the Soviet {{offensive}} potential for the summer of 1943 <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> off {{a large number of}} forces that they anticipated would be in the Kursk salient.|$|E

50|$|This aloe {{is easily}} {{propagated}} <b>by</b> <b>cuttings.</b>|$|R
5|$|The regular (roman) {{style of}} Bembo {{is based on}} Griffo's {{typeface}} for Manutius. Griffo, sometimes called Francesco da Bologna (of Bologna), was an engraver who created designs <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> punches in steel. These were used as a master to stamp matrices, the moulds used to cast metal type.|$|E
5|$|Emerson (1858) {{documented}} {{the presence of}} Vedar north of Eravur who subsisted by fishing or helping the traditional fisherfolk, as well <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> wood for Muslim traders. He speculated that there were then at least 400 to 500 individuals in the group. He also recorded {{that it was the}} British colonial officers, as well as Weslyan missionaries who provided land for them to start cultivating yams and other vegetables.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{irritation}} can {{be avoided}} <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water. Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds {{than the rest of}} the bulb. Refrigerating the onions before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can blow the gas away from the eyes. The more often one chops onions, the less one experiences eye irritation.|$|E
50|$|Propagation is <b>by</b> <b>cuttings</b> {{taken in}} the summer.|$|R
50|$|Pterocarya stenoptera {{can also}} be {{propagated}} <b>by</b> <b>cuttings.</b>|$|R
50|$|It reproduces easily <b>by</b> <b>cuttings</b> of {{the leaves}} during {{vegetative}} period.|$|R
5|$|Flowering {{may take}} some years from seed; a minimum of four years is average. Buying an {{advanced}} plant may hasten this process, as will getting a cutting-grown plant. Banksia ericifolia can be propagated easily by seed, {{and is one of}} the (relatively) easier banksias to propagate <b>by</b> <b>cutting.</b> Named cultivars are by necessity propagated by cuttings as this ensures that the plant produced bears the same attributes as the original plant.|$|E
5|$|Further inland, another serious {{attack was}} made on the British lines of {{communication}} from Ramleh by units of both the Ottoman 16th Division on the plain and the 19th Division in the hills. The aim of this counterattack was the destruction of two British Empire divisions in the hills <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> their lines of communication.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{the high}} level of bog being {{destroyed}} <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> has raised environmental concerns. The problem is particularly acute for raised bogs as they yield a higher-grade fuel than blanket bogs. Plans are now in place in both the Republic and Northern Ireland to conserve most of the remaining raised bogs on the island.|$|E
50|$|They can {{be easily}} {{propagated}} <b>by</b> <b>cuttings</b> pushed into the substrate.|$|R
50|$|It is {{frequently}} {{used as an}} aquarium plant. Propagation is <b>by</b> <b>cuttings.</b>|$|R
50|$|They can be {{propagated}} <b>by</b> <b>cuttings,</b> subdivision of clumps, or by seed.|$|R
5|$|In the BBC series {{based on}} Graves' novel (where the role {{is played by}} John Hurt), Caligula, {{although}} unhinged since early childhood, becomes dangerously psychotic after an apparent epileptic seizure and awakens believing that he has metamorphosed into the god Zeus. He kills Drusilla while trying to re-enact the birth of Athena <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> his child from her womb.|$|E
5|$|Once Allied {{troops were}} on the ground, some German units used the Rommelspargel for defense, <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> them down and using the logs to {{reinforce}} impromptu positions. Sturmmann Karl Vasold of the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend described how his unit dug in under fire in a tank trench and foxholes on the road from Buron to Villons-les-Buissons, and used cut-down Rommelspargel poles to cover their positions and protect them from enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{but these}} are hard to obtain. Seeds do not require any {{treatment}} before sowing, and take 37 to 40 days to germinate. Propagation <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> has not been attempted, but might be possible, since the closely related B.cuneata has been propagated this way, albeit with unpredictable results. The plant should be grown in deep, acidic to neutral sand at a sheltered site. It is recommended to prune it when young, to encourage branching.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{cultivated}} in Tasmania, with {{propagation by seed}} more successful than <b>by</b> <b>cuttings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Propagation is by {{division}} of the clumps. Propagation <b>by</b> <b>cuttings</b> is difficult, {{because of the risk}} of rot.|$|R
50|$|These {{plants are}} usually {{propagated}} by seeds. They are also commercially propagated <b>by</b> <b>cuttings.</b> Peperomia cuttings root easily.|$|R
5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{though these}} can be {{difficult}} to extract from the follicles. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take 12 to 48 days to germinate. Cultivars require propagation <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> for progeny to grow true. Cuttings are slow to strike. Attempts to graft B.coccinea have met with little success.|$|E
5|$|Resin is {{gathered}} by tapping trees including silver-fir and Aleppo pine; the best resin {{is from the}} terebinth. On Mount Ida in Crete the people gather pitch from Corsican pine and Aleppo pine. Gums such as frankincense, myrrh and balsam of Mecca are gathered either <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> the plant or naturally. Frankincense and myrrh are gathered into the closely guarded temple of the Sabaeans. Cassia and cinnamon also come from the Arabian peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarians {{recruited}} {{an army of}} 40,000, many drawn locally from Transylvania. Many knights and Hungarian aristocrats followed, one of {{them being}} Stefan Báthory. With them, they brought 500 cannons and other heavy siege equipment. The Moldavians, being fewer in number and seeing that the Hungarians were determined to wage war, started to evacuate the population close to the Hungarian border and blockaded the passages <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> down trees and placing them on the roads.|$|E
50|$|Cotoneaster lucidus can be {{propagated}} <b>by</b> <b>cuttings</b> or <b>by</b> seed, with stratification {{necessary in}} the case of the latter.|$|R
50|$|Propagation is {{relatively}} easy <b>by</b> <b>cuttings</b> of mature material, and seedlings may spontaneously arise in gardens where it is established.|$|R
50|$|Anthurium can be {{propagated}} by seed or vegetatively <b>by</b> <b>cuttings.</b> In {{the commercial}} Anthurium trade, most propagation is via tissue culture.|$|R
5|$|The former fort was {{captured}} by Murad Khan of Maqpon Dynasty, the ruler of Baltistan, in the Conquest of Khaplu in the 1590s <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> off the water and other supplies to the fort. The troops of Murad besieged the fort for three months, resulting in the surrender of Rahim Khan, the 62nd Yabgo dynasty ruler of Khaplu. The fort again fell to invaders in the 1660s and 1674.|$|E
5|$|The gibbet {{could be}} {{operated}} <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> the rope supporting the blade or by {{pulling out the}} pin that held the rope. If the offender was to be executed for stealing an animal, a cord was fastened to the pin and tied to either the stolen animal {{or one of the}} same species, which was then driven off, withdrawing the pin and allowing the blade to drop.|$|E
5|$|The new Greenville Bridge {{opened to}} traffic on August 4, 2010. In 2011 the massive process of {{removing}} the old bridge <b>by</b> <b>cutting</b> into small sections to be recycled was begun, and {{was expected to}} be completed by September 2012. At times the river has been closed to traffic to aid the demolition. The job is dangerous and two workers have died.|$|E
50|$|Propagation is <b>by</b> <b>cuttings</b> or from seed. It prefers good {{drainage}} {{and part}} shade and requires pruning to enhance flower production.|$|R
50|$|Ajuga australis can {{be readily}} grown in part-shaded or sunny spots in the garden on most soils. It is readily {{propagated}} <b>by</b> <b>cuttings.</b>|$|R
50|$|It can be {{propagated}} <b>by</b> <b>cuttings</b> or <b>by</b> {{dividing the}} rhizome. The first method has the disadvantage that the variegation will be lost.|$|R
