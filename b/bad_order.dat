25|$|In July 1778, {{a strong}} force of Loyalist troops and Iroquois under Colonel John Butler {{approached}} the Wyoming Valley. Colonel Zebulon Butler, home {{on leave from}} the Continental Army at the time, was chosen to lead the militia which assembled at Forty Fort. Colonel Butler favored delay, as reinforcements might be expected from Philadelphia and other local forts. However, Captain Stewart (who commanded the company of men from Hanover Township) and others argued that they should immediately attack and drive off the enemy before they could be besieged in Forty Fort. Their counsel carried the day, and the militia marched out on July 3, 1778. They encountered the Loyalist and Indian forces a few miles away. Getting into <b>bad</b> <b>order</b> as they attacked the Loyalists, an onset by the Iroquois panicked the militia as they attempted to dress their lines, and utterly routed them. Captain Stewart and his cousin, Lieutenant Lazarus Stewart, Jr. were both killed in the fight. The troops wounded and taken prisoner were tortured and killed in {{what became known as}} the Wyoming Valley massacre.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT [...] We {{know that}} binary {{decision}} diagram is a data structure {{that is used}} to store a Boolean function. They are used to find out the terminal reliability of a computer communication network. To generate the binary decision diagram of a given computer communication network, we need to order the edges of the given computer communication network because the size of the binary decision diagram is dependent on the ordering of the variables (edges). There are three types of variable ordering; optimal, good and <b>bad</b> <b>ordering.</b> Optimal ordering are those ordering which generate minimum size binary decision diagram. In this paper we have shown that if a directed computer communication network has m disjoints min-paths then m! optimal variable orderings exist to generate the binary decision diagrams of the given computer communication network...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{abstraction}} technique, event order abstraction (EOA), for parametric safety verification of real-time systems in which ``correct orderings of events'' needed for system correctness are maintained by timing {{constraints on the}} systems' behavior. By using EOA, one can separate the task of verifying a real-time system into two parts: 1. Safety property verification of the system given that only correct event orderings occur; and 2. Derivation of timing parameter constraints for correct orderings {{of events in the}} system. The user first identifies a candidate set of <b>bad</b> event <b>orders.</b> Then, by using ordinary untimed model-checking, the user examines whether a discretized system model in which all timing constraints are abstracted away satisfies a desirable safety property under the assumption that the identified <b>bad</b> event <b>orders</b> occur in no system execution. The user uses counterexamples obtained from the model-checker to identify additional <b>bad</b> event <b>orders,</b> and repeats the process until the model-checking succeeds. In this step, the user obtains a sufficient set of <b>bad</b> event <b>orders</b> that must be excluded by timing synthesis for system correctness. Next, the algorithm presented in the paper automatically derives a set of timing parameter constraints under which the system does not exhibit the identified bad event orderings. From this step combined with the untimed model-checking step,the user obtains a sufficient set of timing parameter constraints under which the system executes correctly with respect to a given safety property. We illustrate the use of EOA with a train-gate example inspired by the general railroad crossing problem. We also summarize three other case studies, a biphase mark protocol, the IEEE 1394 root contention protocol, and the Fischer mutual exclusion algorithm...|$|R

60|$|Travelling {{in these}} divers moods, about {{the hour of}} noon they reached a small straggling village, in which, as usual, were seen {{one or two of}} those predominating towers, or peel houses, which, for reasons of defence {{elsewhere}} detailed, were at that time to be found in every Border hamlet. A brook flowed beside the village, and watered the valley in which it stood. There was also a mansion {{at the end of the}} village, and a little way separated from it, much dilapidated, and in very <b>bad</b> <b>order,</b> but appearing to have been the abode of persons of some consideration. The situation was agreeable, being an angle formed by the stream, bearing three or four large sycamore trees, which were in full leaf, and served to relieve the dark appearance of the mansion, which was built of a deep red stone. The house itself was a large one, but was now obviously too big for the inmates; several windows were built up, especially those which opened from the lower story; others were blockaded in a less substantial manner. The court before the door, which had once been defended with a species of low outer-wall, now ruinous, was paved, but the stones were completely covered with long gray nettles, thistles, and other weeds, which, shooting up betwixt the flags, had displaced many of them from their level. Even matters demanding more peremptory attention had been left neglected, in a manner which argued sloth or poverty in the extreme. The stream, undermining a part of the bank near an angle of the ruinous wall, had brought it down, with a corner turret, the ruins of which lay in the bed of the river. The current, interrupted by the ruins which it had overthrown, and turned yet nearer to the site of the tower, had greatly enlarged the breach it had made, and was in the process of undermining the ground on which the house itself stood, unless it were speedily protected by sufficient bulwarks.|$|E
6000|$|We enter a small public-house by the {{roadside}} to get a draught of beer. In the kitchen, we behold the landlord and a tall man who is a customer. Both stare {{as a matter of}} course; the tall man especially, after taking one look at our knapsacks, fixes his eyes firmly on us and sits bolt upright on the bench without saying a word--he is evidently prepared for the worst we can do. We get into conversation with the landlord, a jovial, talkative fellow, who desires greatly to know what we are, if we have no objection. We ask him, what he thinks we are?--"Well," [...] says the landlord, pointing to my friend's knapsack, which has a square ruler strapped to it, for architectural drawing--"well, I think you are both of you mappers--mappers who come here to make new roads--you may be coming to make a railroad, I dare say--we've had mappers in the country before this--I know a mapper myself--here's both your good healths!" [...] We drink the landlord's good health in return, and disclaim the honour of being [...] "mappers;" [...] we walk through the country (we tell him) for pleasure alone, and take any roads we can get, without wanting to make new ones. The landlord would like to know, if that is the case, why we carry those weights at our backs?--Because we want to take our luggage about with us. Couldn't we pay to ride?--Yes, we could. And yet we like walking better?--Yes we do. This last answer utterly confounds the tall customer, who has been hitherto listening intently to the dialogue. It is evidently too much for his credulity--he pays his reckoning, and walks out in a hurry without uttering a word. The landlord appears to be convinced, but it is only in appearance. We leave him standing at his door, keeping his eye on us as long as we are in sight, still evidently persuaded that we are [...] "mappers," [...] but [...] "mappers" [...] of a <b>bad</b> <b>order</b> whose presence is fraught with some unknown peril to the security of the Queen's highway.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. First-in-first-out (FIFO) queues {{are among}} the most {{fundamental}} and highly studied concurrent data structures. The most effective and practical dynamic-memory concurrent queue implementation in the literature is the lock-free FIFO queue algorithm of Michael and Scott, included in the standard Java TM Concurrency Package. This paper presents a new dynamic-memory lock-free FIFO queue algorithm that performs consistently better than the Michael and Scott queue. The key idea behind our new algorithm is a novel way of replacing the singly-linked list of Michael and Scott, whose pointers are inserted using a costly compare-and-swap (CAS) operation, by an “optimistic” doubly-linked list whose pointers are updated using a simple store, yet can be “fixed ” if a <b>bad</b> <b>ordering</b> of events causes them to be inconsistent. We believe it is the first example of such an “optimistic ” approach being applied to a real world data structure. ...|$|R

5000|$|George Porterfield {{initially}} was appointed colonel and inspector general of militia at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. On May 4, 1861, General Lee ordered Porterfield to organize forces at Grafton in northwest Virginia, now West Virginia. Porterfield {{was expected to}} hold and protect both the main line and the Parkersburg branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at that location. Porterfield arrived in Grafton on May 14, 1861. He found that the townspeople, being mostly Irish railroad workers, mainly supported the Union and that the pro-Union Grafton Guards militia company occupied the town. He found no secessionist officers and men at Grafton and, setting up at the more friendly location of Fetterman, about 2 mi north of Grafton, he soon discovered that the few volunteer companies in the area were armed poorly, if at all.In Fetterman he found Capt. William P. Thompson and his company, the Marion Guards, equipped with 175 muskets which had been purchased by Thompson. Porterfield was able to intercept Federal telegraph messages with local support, and reported to Lee that companies were being organized in Clarksburg, Pruntytown, Philippi, Weston, and Fairmont, but that only two were armed, and one had only [...] "old flint-lock muskets, in <b>bad</b> <b>order,</b> and no amumnition...". The companies raised under Porterfield were later organized into the 25th Virginia Infantry, the 31st Virginia Infantry, and the 9th Battalion of Virginia Infantry. He advised authorities in Richmond that {{they would need to}} send a large force to hold the area for the state, but the leaders in Richmond, including General Lee, were unwilling to send soldiers from {{the eastern part of the}} state to the western counties at that time for reasons that included not irritating Union sympathizers in the area.

He also made an attempt, {{with the same}} party, on the highest mountain in the range, the unclimbed Barre des Ecrins. In Tuckett's own words: Arrived on the plateau the Glacier de l'Encula a most striking view of the Ecrins burst upon us, and a hasty inspection encouraged us to hope its ascent would be practicable. On the sides of La Bérade and the Glacier Noirit presents, as has already been stated, the most precipitous and inaccessible face that can be conceived, but {{in the direction of}} the Glacier de l'Encula, as the upper part of the Glacier Blanc is named on the French map, the slopes are less rapid, and immense masses of névé and séracs cover it nearly to the summit. The snow was in very <b>bad</b> <b>order,</b> and as we sank at each step above the knee, it soon became evident that our prospects of success were extremely doubtful. A nearer approach, too, disclosed traces of fresh avalanches, and after much deliberation and a careful examination through the telescope, it was decided that the chances in our favour were too small to render it desirable to waste time in the attempt [...] According to Whymper, Tuckett [...] "halted before the Pointe des Ecrins the Barre was then called, and, dismayed by its appearance, withdrew his forces to gather less dangerous laurels elsewhere". The expedition did have the benefit, however, of [...] "throwing some light on the Ecrins".|$|E
50|$|On 3 December 1626 Penington, then admiral of a {{squadron}} in the Downs, {{was ordered to}} seize French ships. The determination of Richelieu to make France a maritime power was held to be {{an insult to the}} supremacy of England; and on the 24th Penington was directed to go to Le Havre, where eight ships which the French king had lately bought from the Dutch were lying. These he was, if possible, to provoke into firing at him, but in any case to pick a quarrel with them, and so to take, sink, or burn them. Penington put to sea prepared to obey, but, after looking into Havre and finding no ships there, he returned to Falmouth, and wrote to Buckingham complaining that he had been sent out at the bad time of the year, with only three weeks' provisions on board, his ships in <b>bad</b> <b>order,</b> badly supplied and badly manned, 'so that if we come to any service, it is almost impossible we can come off with honour or safety.' In the following spring he put to sea under more favourable circumstances, and captured and sent in some twenty French ships at one time, and swept the sea from Calais to Bordeaux. The prizes were sold, the sailors and soldiers, who had been on the verge of mutiny, were paid, and France, it was said, would provide the means for her own ruin. In 1631 Penington, with his flag in the Convertine, was admiral 'for the guard of the Narrow Seas.' He was employed on the same service through the summer of 1633 and of 1634, with his flag in the Unicorn, on board which ship he was knighted by the king on 14 April. In 1635, in the Swiftsure, he was rear admiral of the fleet under the Earl of Lindsey, Sir William Monson being the vice-admiral; and on Lindsey and Monson leaving the fleet in October, Penington remained in command of the winter guard.|$|E
