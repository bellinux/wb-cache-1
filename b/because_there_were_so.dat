25|$|In 1846, Birkenhead Park Cricket Club {{was formed}} on Park Drive, {{based in the}} park itself. At the time, {{it was a very}} {{exclusive}} club in which all the members were Old Boys of the top public schools. <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> few clubs in the area, the members arranged matches between themselves, such as married vs. singles. From the start, the ground was enclosed by railings and initially had a tent used as the pavilion. This was later followed by a wooden structure which was then replaced by the present club house that still stands to this very day.|$|E
25|$|North-Eastern Rhodesia was {{initially}} policed by locally recruited rank-and-filers, led by white officers from {{south of the}} river; the first force was raised in 1896. During its early years it busied itself eliminating the slave trade, in which foreign traders, mostly Arabs, captured villagers for sale as slaves overseas. A more regular police force was then introduced by the Company {{in each of the}} northern territories. <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> few white immigrants to North-Eastern Rhodesia—and because most of them were men of the church or of business rather than potential recruits—the North-Eastern Rhodesia Constabulary was almost exclusively black, including all of its non-commissioned officers.|$|E

25|$|Chinese {{women were}} scarce in every place where Chinese indentured laborers were brought, the {{migration}} {{was dominated by}} Chinese men. Up to the 1940s men made up {{the vast majority of}} the Costa Rican Chinese community. Males made up the majority of the original Chinese community in Mexico and they married Mexican women. One stark difference between Indian and Chinese Coolies was the treatment of women, despite both groups having a severe shortage. Though there were crimes against women and women being murdered, these incidents were nowhere near as frequent as with Indian Coolies. Though this was <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> few Chinese, it became common for people to believe that Indians murder their women while Chinese women stay alive because, unlike their Indian counterparts, they are chaste.|$|E
500|$|Part of {{the problem}} with {{creating}} [...] "mytharc" [...] for the writers was due to the fact that, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> few mythology episodes each season, they were often forced to put as much material as they could into each episode. Originally, {{a large portion of the}} episode was supposed to reveal the history of the Syndicate via flashback. Reportedly, these scenes would have featured younger versions of Bill Mulder (played by Peter Donat), The Smoking Man, Dr. Openshaw, the Elders, and many others. However, this never panned out, and Carter and Spotnitz had to reframe the episode around narration courtesy of the Smoking Man, which was filmed and edited under extreme pressure near the end of production. While the previous episode, [...] "Two Fathers", was titled after the duality of Bill Mulder and The Smoking Man, this episode was titled [...] "One Son" [...] to reflect the fact that Mulder was the only remaining son of either of these fathers, after the shooting of Jeffrey Spender and the rejection of Alex Krycek.|$|E
500|$|Attention {{initially}} {{focused on}} the role of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), since on May 12, 1993, a week before the firings, associate White House counsel William Kennedy had requested that the FBI look into possible improprieties in the Travel Office operation. FBI agents went there and, although initially reluctant, authorized a preliminary investigation. [...] Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster became worried about the firings about to take place and ordered the KPMG Peat Marwick review, asking the FBI to hold off in the meantime. [...] The accounting review started on May 14 and the report was given to the White House on May 17. KPMG was unable to do an actual audit, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> few records in the Travel Office that could be audited and because the office did not use the double-entry bookkeeping system that audits are based upon. One KPMG representative later described the office as [...] "an ungodly mess in terms of records" [...] with ten years of material piled up in a closet. [...] When the review came back with its reports of irregularities, Watkins went ahead with the terminations on May 19.|$|E

500|$|Lionel {{also has}} a key {{relationship}} with Martha Kent, Clark Kent's adoptive mother. This relationship first develops in season two when Lionel hires Martha to be his assistant; it is further developed in season five. Glover felt Lionel's attraction to Martha grows in season five when Jonathan Kent dies because he now sees Martha as a single woman and is now more attainable; Glover believes Lionel was seeking to attain Martha's [...] "goodness" [...] and the attraction {{is not based on}} lust. When Lionel is in Martha's company he tries to present himself as a man she could be with; he consciously attempts to change years of selfish behavior. Writer Holly Harold said his relationship with Martha parallels Lex's relationship with Lana; both men believe these two women will be their saving grace and pull them back from the dark side. Annette O'Toole said Martha's interest in Lionel is like watching a dangerous animal; [...] "It's that attraction you have for a very beautiful, dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, {{but at the same time}} you feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] O'Toole also said she believes Martha's motivation is to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When Martha left the show, writer Todd Slavkin said they wanted to give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on screen. Slavkin said they could do nothing equivalent to what they gave John Schneider <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> many storylines by the season six finale they could fit nothing else in. The writers realized they could not kill off the character so they sent her to the U.S. Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage. O'Toole and Al Gough said Martha has a small attraction to Lionel and that nothing serious would come from it.|$|E

2500|$|Rusk {{participated in}} a [...] "gathering of the {{mountain}} clans" [...] on Mount Rainier in 1905. Always {{a leader in the}} mountains, he went with a scouting party from Paradise Park around to the west side of Rainier, possibly up Kautz Cleaver, in an attempt to find a route that avoided the notorious rockfall on the normal Gibraltar route. Unsuccessful, the scouting party returned and rejoined the rest of the party for the ascent. Over 200 members from the Sierra Club, American Alpine Club, Mazamas, and the Appalachian Mountain Club were attempting the climb. <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> many attempting the climb, the clubs divided into two parties and climbed on succeeding days. Ninety-eight people completed the ascent including Rusk who volunteered as a leader of one of the groups.|$|E
2500|$|The Associated Press, however, {{took issue}} with Ellerbe's assessment. The news agency {{reported}} that 40 paramedics left the department during Ellerbe's tenure, but just two had been hired in the same period. It also reported that [...] "the new hires and equipment still leave the District of Columbia well short of the staffing levels in similar-sized cities". Whereas most similarly-situated EMS departments deployed more than 70 paramedics per shift, DCFEMS had just 35—and 21 of those were not riding ambulances (with their life-saving equipment) but riding on fire engines. DCFEMS {{officials said they had}} no plan {{to increase the number of}} paramedics per shift. The firefighters' union said the short staffing meant that roughly five of the 14 advanced life support ambulances available each day were downgraded to basic life support because they were staffed only with EMTs. They also said incidents of mandatory overtime were increasing <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> few paramedics.|$|E
2500|$|The {{supporting}} {{tour for}} Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights nearly {{resulted in the}} band breaking-up once again, but also saw HIM playing the United States for the first time; a one-off show organized by professional skateboarder and television personality Bam Margera. Following a two month break in early 2002, HIM regrouped and began rehearsing material for another album. Valo later credited the tour for Deep Shadow and Brilliant Highlights for bringing the band closer together, which culminated in their fourth album, entitled Love Metal. The album saw HIM once again working with producer Hiili Hiilesmaa, and was viewed by the band {{as a reaction to}} the difficulties they faced during Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights. According to Valo: [...] "After what we considered a disappointment with Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> many chefs in the kitchen, we wanted to be a band [...] that we control what we do, and everybody else can fuck-off." [...] Love Metal was also the band's first album to make prominent use of the band's logo, the heartagram, on its cover, which Valo called [...] "a statement of intent [...] musically, visually and ideologically." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 30 May 2007, Australian Open tournament {{director}} Craig Tiley {{announced that}} as of the 2008 Australian Open, the Rebound Ace surface {{that had been used}} since 1988 would be replaced by a newer, faster Plexicushion surface. The Rebound Ace surface had been criticized for several years, from players including Andy Roddick and Mark Philippoussis, who claimed that the [...] "stick" [...] of the court was a contributing factor in many players injuring themselves. This [...] "stick" [...] was a result of the thick rubber mat (10mm) laid beneath the surface, the high heat retention because of this, and the high temperatures present during the Australian summer, which intermittently resulted in the extreme heat policy being invoked. Conversely, players such as Pete Sampras and Marat Safin put the high number of injuries down to lack of preparation from players; partly {{due to the fact that}} the tournament is held so early in the year, but also <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> few tournaments preceding it. Rebound Ace was also chastised by Lleyton Hewitt for having an inconsistent bounce, in terms of height and pace (shock absorption); and claimed that these factors varied depending on the weather. The heat retention of the surface had also been a point of contention between players.|$|E
2500|$|Rasputin {{had persuaded}} Maria to marry Boris Soloviev, the charismatic son of Nikolai Soloviev, the Treasurer of the Holy Synod {{and one of}} her father's admirers. Boris Soloviev, a {{graduate}} of a school of mysticism, quickly emerged as Rasputin's successor after the murder. Boris, who had studied Madame Blavatsky's theosophy, and hypnotism, attended meetings at which Rasputin's followers attempted to communicate with the dead through prayer meetings and séances. Maria also attended the meetings, but later wrote in her diary that she could not understand why her father kept telling her to [...] "love Boris" [...] when the group spoke to him at the séances. She said she did not like Boris at all. Boris was no more enthusiastic about Maria. In his own diary, he wrote that his wife was not even useful for sexual relations, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> many women who had bodies he found more attractive than hers. In September 1917 Boris received jewels from the Tsarina to help arrange for their escape, but according to Radzinsky, he kept the funds for himself. Nonetheless, she married Boris on October 5, 1917 in the chapel of the Tauride Palace. After the fall of the Russian Provisional Government the situation got worse. In spring 1918 the couple fled to her mother. They lived [...] in Pokrovskoye Tyumen and Tobolsk.|$|E
2500|$|Robin {{chose to}} compete in his home country, however, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> few local {{professionals}} active {{at the time it}} was difficult to earn a living and he decided to retire. The national title would remain vacant for three years until Tom Alley won the title shortly before of the founding of the Dominion Wrestling Union. He briefly came out of retirement to compete for the Wellington Wrestling Association in 1930, refereeing some preliminary amateur bouts at the Wellington Town Hall, and visiting American wrestler Ed [...] "Strangler" [...] Lewis expressed interest in wrestling Robin for the NWA Australasian title. By 1932, Robin was in full training in preparation for a comeback and, after a six-year absence, had his first return bout against Finnish wrestler Peter Limutkin at the Wellington Town Hall on 18 July 1932. Although he was awarded the victory, Robin's in-ring performance was considered disappointing. The Evening Post noted [...] "Against Peter Limutkin he did not show anything which would give hope of his performing creditably against a visiting wrestler approaching his own weight. Robin certainly won, but that was all, and the match can best be written down as just another effort on the part of the [...] Wrestling Union to give a local man a chance to prove his worth".|$|E

[...] (p.76), {{and went on to}} say that [...] "Contrary to general belief, Madhubala is rather simple and unassuming" [...] (p.78). This is echoed in Madhubala's sister's {{interview}} with Filmfare: [...] "(Madhubala) became a craze because she was never seen in public. She wasn't allowed to attend any function, any premiere. She had no friends. But she never resisted, she was obedient. Being protective, my father earned the reputation of being domineering". Dilip Kumar added: [...] "She was extremely popular... and I think the only star for whom people thronged outside the gates. Very often when shooting was over, there’d be a vast crowd standing at the gates just to have a look at Madhu... It wasn’t so for anyone else. That was her personal effect on fans. Her personality was vivacious." [...] But, [...] "She was aware of her beauty," [...] reminisces B. K.
