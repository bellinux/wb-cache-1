25|$|The {{weight of}} the {{locomotive}} is roughly proportional to the power output; {{the number of axles}} required is determined by this weight divided by the axleload limit for the trackage where the locomotive is to be used. The number of driving wheels is derived from the adhesive weight in the same manner, leaving the remaining axles to be accounted for by the leading and trailing bogies. Passenger locomotives conventionally had two-axle leading bogies for better guidance at speed; on the other hand, the vast increase {{in the size of the}} grate and firebox in the 20th century meant that a trailing bogie was called upon to provide support. In Europe, some use was made of several variants of the <b>Bissel</b> bogie in which the swivelling movement of a single axle truck controls the lateral displacement of the front driving axle (and in one case the second axle too). This was mostly applied to 8-coupled express and mixed traffic locomotives, and considerably improved their ability to negotiate curves whilst restricting overall locomotive wheelbase and maximising adhesion weight.|$|E
500|$|On the Southern Railway's Central and Eastern sections, crews {{complained that}} the {{locomotives}} rolled heavily and unpredictably on the cheaply laid track of the former SECR and LBSCR networks, leading to their nickname, [...] "Rolling Rivers".

These were modified in later batches, with limited success. The rough-riding was also attributed to the frames, which were of insubstantial construction to save weight. The bracing proved incapable of counteracting the stresses applied to the frames when travelling at speed and caused excessive vibration on the footplate at higher outputs.|$|E

We cannot but remark in Southern Arabia the footprints of the Hindu, whose superstitions, like the Phoenix which flew from India to expire in Egypt, passed over to Arabia with Dwipa Sukhatra (Socotra) for a resting place {{on its way to}} the regions of the remotest West. As regards the difference between the Japhetic and Semitic tongues, it may be remarked that though nothing can be more distinct than Sanscrit and Arabic, yet that Pahlavi and Hebrew (Prof. Bohlen on Genesis) present some remarkable points of resemblance. I have attempted in a work on Sind to collect words common to both families. And further research convinces me that such vocables as the Arabic Taur [Arabic] the Persian Tora [Persian] and the Latin “Taurus” denote an ancient rapprochement, whose mysteries still invite the elucidation of modern science. [FN#6] The Sharif families affect marrying female slaves, thereby showing the intense pride which finds no Arab noble enough for them. Others take to wife Badawi girls: their blood, therefore, is by no means pure. The worst feature of their system is the forced celibacy of their daughters; they are never married into any but Sharif families; consequently they often die in spinsterhood. The effects of this custom are most pernicious, for though celibacy exists in the East it is by no means synonymous with chastity. Here it springs from a morbid sense of honour, and arose, it is popularly said, from an affront taken by a Sharif against his daughter’s husband. But all Arabs condemn the practice. [FN#7] I use this word as popular abuse has fixed it. Every Orientalist knows that Badawin (Bedouin) is the plural form of Badawi, an “ism al-nisbah,” or adjective derived from Badu, a Desert. “Some words notoriously corrupt,” says Gibbon, “are fixed, and as it were naturalised, in the vulgar tongue.” The word “Badawi” is not insulting, like “Turk” applied to an Osmanli, or “Fellah” to the Egyptian. But you affront the wild man by mistaking his clan for a lower one. “Ya Hitaymi,” for instance, addressed to a Harb Badawi, makes him finger his dagger. [FN#8] This coarseness is not a little increased by a truly Badawi habit of washing the locks with—[Arabic]. It is not considered wholly impure, and is also used for the eyes, upon which its ammonia would act as a rude stimulant. The only cosmetic is clarified butter freely applied to the body as well as to the hair. [FN#9] “Kurun” ([Arabic]) properly means “horns.” The Sharifs generally wear their hair in “Haffah” ([Arabic]), long locks hanging down both sides of the neck and shaved away about a finger’s breadth round the forehead and behind the neck. [FN#10] This traveller describes the modern Mesopotamian and Northern race, which, as its bushy beard—unusual feature in pure Arab blood—denotes, is mixed with central Asian. In the North, as might be expected, the camels are hairy; whereas, in Al-Hijaz and in the low parts of Al-Yaman, a whole animal does not give a handful fit for weaving. The Arabs attribute this, as we should, to heat, which causes the longer hairs to drop off. [FN#11] “Magnum inter Arabes et Africanos discrimen efficit [Greek]. Arabum parvula membra sicut nobilis aequi. Africanum tamen flaccum, crassum longumque: ita quiescens, erectum tamen parum distenditur. Argumentum validissimum est ad indagandam Egyptorum originem: Nilotica enim gens membrum habet Africanum.” [FN#12] Whereas the Saxon thumb is thick, flat, and short, extending scarcely half way to the middle joint of the index. [FN#13] A similar unwillingness to name the wife may be found in some parts of southern Europe, where probably jealousy or possibly Asiatic custom has given rise to it. Among the Maltese it appears in a truly ridiculous way, e.g., “dice la mia moglie, con rispetto parlando, &c.,” says the husband, adding to the word spouse a “saving your presence,” as if he were speaking of something offensive. [FN#14] Dr. Howe (Report on Idiotcy in Massachusetts, 1848,) asserts that “the law against the marriage of relations is made out as clearly as though it were written on tables of stone.” He proceeds to show that in seventeen households where the parents were connected by blood, of ninety-five children one was a dwarf, one deaf, twelve scrofulous, and forty-four idiots—total fifty-eight diseased! [FN#15] Yet the celebrated “Flying Childers” and all his race were remarkably bred in. There is still, in my humble opinion, much mystery about the subject, to be cleared up only by the studies of physiologists. [FN#16] This sounds in English like an “Irish bull.” I translate “Badu,” as the dictionaries do, “a Desert.” [FN#17] The Sharbat Kajari is the “Acquetta” of Persia, and derives its name from the present royal family. It is said to be a mixture of verdigris with milk; if so, it is a very clumsy engine of state policy. In Egypt and Mosul, Sulaymani (the common name for an Afghan) is used to signify “poison”; but I know not whether it be merely euphuistic or confined to some species. The banks of the Nile are infamous for these arts, and Mohammed Ali Pasha imported, it is said, professional poisoners from Europe. [FN#18] Throughout the world the strictness of the Lex Scripta is in inverse ratio to that of custom: whenever the former is lax, the latter is stringent, and vice versa. Thus in England, where law leaves men comparatively free, they are slaves to a grinding despotism of conventionalities, unknown in the land of tyrannical rule. This explains why many men, accustomed to live under despotic governments, feel fettered and enslaved in the so-called free countries. Hence, also, the reason why notably in a republic there is less private and practical liberty than under a despotism. The “Kazi al-Arab” (Judge of the Arabs) is in distinction to the Kazi al-Shara, or the Kazi of the Koran. The former is, almost always, some sharp-witted greybeard, with a minute knowledge of genealogy and precedents, a retentive memory and an eloquent tongue. [FN#19] Thus the Arabs, being decidedly a parsimonious people, indulge in exaggerated praises and instances of liberality. Hatim Tai, whose generosity is unintelligible to Europeans, becomes the Arab model of the “open hand.” Generally a high beau ideal is no proof of a people’s practical pre-eminence, and when exaggeration enters into it and suits the public taste, a low standard of actuality may be fairly suspected. But to convince the oriental mind you must dazzle it. Hence, in part, the superhuman courage of Antar, the liberality of Hatim, the justice of Omar, and the purity of Laila and Majnun under circumstances more trying than aught chronicled in Mathilde, or in the newest American novel. [FN#20] At the battle of <b>Bissel,</b> when Mohammed Ali of Egypt broke the 40,000 guerillas of Faisal son of Sa’ud the Wahhabi, whole lines of the Benu Asir tribe were found dead and tied by the legs with ropes. This system of colligation dates from old times in Arabia, as the “Affair of Chains” (Zat al-Salasil) proves. It is alluded to by the late Sir Henry Elliot in his “Appendix to the Arabs in Sind,”—a work of remarkable sagacity and research. According to the “Beglar-Nameh,” it was a “custom of the people of Hind and Sind, whenever they devote themselves to death, to bind themselves to each other by their mantles and waistbands.” It seems to have been an ancient practice in the West as in the East: the Cimbri, to quote no other instances, were tied together with cords when attacked by Marius. Tactic truly worthy of savages to prepare for victory by expecting a defeat! [FN#21] Though differing in opinion, upon one subject, from the Rev. Mr. Robertson, the lamented author of this little work, I cannot refrain from expressing the highest admiration of those noble thoughts, those exalted views, and those polished sentiments which, combining the delicacy of the present with the chivalry of a past age, appear in a style ...|$|E

Collectively, these results show that GmbHLHm 1 influences nodule development and activity and is linked to a novel mechanism for NH 4 (+) transport common to both yeast and plants. David M.

40|$|February 2008, I {{investigated}} {{the possibilities to}} reduce the number of CPUs needed for several applications with supporting tasks in the KLM IT infrastructure. The research done during my internship was mainly concentrated on the matching of applications with different peak and valley times. Several algorithms were implemented and tested in order to find the best algorithm for the needs of KLM. Another substantial part concerns the automatic analysis of historical data of the CPU utilization of all applications. Only a small part of this thesis is dedicated to the latter, since this was mathematically less interesting. The internship resulted in a (hopefully) user-friendly application that (periodically) can be used by KLM in order to get insight in their current CPU use and the possibilities to improve their utilization grade. Since the application heavily depends on the KLM IT infrastructure and their data, no online package of the application was created. The internship was supervised by Tim van Loosbroek of KLM and Rob H. <b>Bisseling</b> of the Department of Mathematics of Utrecht University. Also involved from KLM was Rene Matla. I would like to express my thanks to all of them. Tim, for the opportunity to do my internship at KLM and his support and suggestions during my project. Rene, for the help in busines...|$|R
30|$|Modern {{agriculture}} {{has increasingly}} {{focused on the}} use of microbial products as alternatives to chemical fertilizers. Benefits from this replacement include substantially lower costs for farmers, less pollution and land degradation, and reduced concerns regarding adverse side effects on human health (Crews and Peoples 2004; Peoples et al. 2009; Saharan and Nehra 2011; Bakker et al. 2012). It is noteworthy that extensive use of rhizobial inoculants in Brazil, mainly with soybean, provides N with a value equivalent to US$ 7 billion in fertilizers (Hungria et al. 2006; Hungria et al. 2007). Several countries—including Brazil—benefit from the use of inoculants carrying PGPR, which may benefit crops by promoting uptake of nutrients and by increasing resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses, among other effects (Okon and Labandera-Gonzalez 1994; Bacon and Hinton 2002; Bashan et al. 2004; Bashan and Bashan 2005; Hungria et al. 2010; Saharan and Nehra 2011). Currently, in Brazil, about 25 million doses of rhizobial inoculant for soybean and 2 million doses of inoculant containing A. brasilense for maize and wheat crops are produced annually. However, despite improved understanding, particularly over the past two decades, of molecular signaling in the rhizobia-legume interaction (e.g. Geurst and <b>Bisseling</b> 2002; Brencic and Winans 2005; Ferguson et al. 2010), as well as of other signals involved in host-microbe interactions (Brencic and Winans 2005), transfer of this knowledge to effective commercial products is still incipient.|$|R
40|$|In legume-rhizobia symbioses, the {{bacteria}} in infected cells are enclosed in a plant membrane, forming organelle-like compartments called symbiosomes. Symbiosomes remain as individual units and avoid fusion with lytic vacuoles of host cells. We observed {{changes in the}} vacuole volume of infected cells and thus hypothesized that microsymbionts may cause modifications in vacuole formation or function. To examine this, we quantified the volumes and surface areas of plant cells, vacuoles, and symbiosomes in root nodules of Medicago truncatula and analyzed the expression and localization of VPS 11 and VPS 39, members of the HOPS vacuole-tethering complex. During the maturation of symbiosomes to become N 2 -fixing organelles, a developmental switch occurs and changes in vacuole features are induced. For example, we found that expression of VPS 11 and VPS 39 in infected cells is suppressed and host cell vacuoles contract, permitting the expansion of symbiosomes. Trafficking of tonoplast-targeted proteins in infected symbiotic cells is also altered, as shown by retargeting of the aquaporin TIP 1 g from the tonoplast membrane to the symbiosome membrane. This retargeting appears to be essential for the maturation of symbiosomes. We propose that these alterations in {{the function of the}} vacuole are key events in the adaptation of the plant cell to host intracellular symbiotic bacteria. Aleksandr Gavrin, Brent N.

40|$|Rhizobium species {{produce a}} protein {{product of the}} nodF gene that has a limited but {{recognizable}} homology to the well-characterized acyl carrier protein (ACP) of Escherichia coli. NodF functions together with NodE in generating a host-specific response to the plant host in the interchange of signals leading to the effective nodulation of roots (H. P. Spaink, J. Weinman, M. A. Djordjevic, C. A. Wijffelman, R. J. H. Okker, and B. J. J. Lugtenberg, EMBO J. 8 : 2811 - 2818, 1989; B. Scheres, C. van de Wiel, A. Zalensky, B. Horvath, H. Spaink, H. van Eck, F. Zwartkruis, A. M.

The nodFE region of Rhizobium leguminosarum has been cloned into a multicopy plasmid and {{has been shown in}} R. leguminosarum to code for a flavonoid-inducible protein that is effectively labeled by radioactive beta-alanine added to the growth medium. After purification, the labeled protein migrates as a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 5, 000 during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, more rapidly than E. coli ACP. In contrast, in native gels the protein is resolved into two bands, both identified as NodF by analysis of the amino terminus and both migrating more slowly than E. coli ACP. Pulse-chase experiments with labeled beta-alanine suggested that the slower-moving band may be the precursor of the faster band. The NodF protein carries a 4 '-phosphopantetheine as a prosthetic group. A NodF fusion protein {{under the control of the}} lac promoter is expressed in E. coli and is labeled with beta-alanine, indicating that it is recognized by the ACP synthase of E. coli.

5000|$|Less {{than four}} months after the release of I Was a Teenage Werewolf, and coinciding with the release of I Was a Teenage Frankenstein, AIP {{released}} Blood of Dracula, a film which bears more than a passing resemblance to their summer box office hit. More or less a remake, and with the hero and villain roles now both played by females." [...] Blood of Dracula, with a story and screenplay credit by I Was a Teenage Werewolf writer Ralph Thornton (a pseudonym for AIP producer Herman Cohen and Aben Kandel), features many other similarities to I Was a Teenage Werewolf: for instance, both have (among other things) a teenager with social behavior problems; an adult mad scientist who is searching for the perfect guinea pig, under the guise of helping troubled youth; an observer who can tell the killings are the work of a monster, a disbelieving police chief afraid of the press, a song written by Jerry Blaine and Paul Dunlap, accompanied by a choreographed [...] "ad-lib" [...] dance number, hypnosis as scientific medical treatment; drug injections, specific references to Carpathia, hairy transformation scenes, and even some of the same dialogue. In addition, two prominent actors from I Was a Teenage Werewolf are also featured in Blood of Dracula, Malcolm Atterbury and Louise Lewis, with Lewis' villain, 'Miss Branding' a practically perfect female version of Whit <b>Bissel's</b> 'Dr. Brandon.' However, few critics have drawn a connection between the two films, and while most reference works consider I Was a Teenage Frankenstein and How to Make a Monster as direct follow-ups to I Was a Teenage Werewolf, not even cinema guru Leonard Maltin speaks of Blood of Dracula as even being related to the trilogy.|$|R
40|$|Plants, unlike animals, {{continue}} to form organs {{after the completion}} of embryogenesis. This continuous formation of new organs allows plants to be flexible in a constantly changing environment. A unique example of adaptation to an environmental signal can be found among members of the family of Leguminosae. Legumes can enter a symbiosis with Rhizobium bacteria that leads to the formation of a complete new organ, the root nodule. Inside these nodules, the hosted bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia that can be used by the plant. Root nodule formation is considered to be acquired by legumes in the course of evolution (Gualtieri and <b>Bisseling,</b> 2000). Several studies show that evolution of new traits involves changes of transcription factors, signalling molecules and structural proteins (Carroll et al., 2001). Homologues of nodulin genes (genes that are highly induced during nodule formation) can be found in non-legumes. This indicates {{that at least some of}} the genes and maybe even processes necessary for nodule development must be functioning in non-legumes, suggesting that rhizobia have recruited genes involved in general plant development for nodule formation. The presence of nodulin homologues in non-legumes opens the possibility to compare the regulation and function of nodulins and nodulin homologues in legumes and non-legumes. From such studies one might learn how the regulation or function of these genes was adjusted to establish a symbiosis with Rhizobium. We studied the regulation and function of the legume ENOD 40 gene and its tomato homologue LeENOD 40. ENOD 40 homologues have been found in legumes as well as non-legumes such as rice (Kouchi et al. 1999), maize, citrus and tobacco (Van de Sande et al. 1996). In the legume Medicago truncatula, ENOD 40 was shown to be required for proper nodule development (Charon et al. 1999). Ectopic expression of soybean ENOD 40 in the non-legume tobacco leads to reduced apical dominance (Van de Sande et al. 1996). This indicates that ENOD 40 plays an important role in both nodule formation and non-symbiotic plant development. In chapter 1 an introduction on root nodule development in legumes is described and the current knowledge on the role of ENOD 40 in this process is summarised. In chapter 2 the isolation of the LeENOD 40 gene from tomato and its mapping position on the tomato genome is described. To enable detailed expression studies of ENOD 40, LeENOD 40 ::GUS is introduced in tomato. Expression of LeENOD 40 ::GUS is analysed throughout the plant life cycle. LeENOD 40 ::GUS expression strikingly co-localises with sites of increased ethylene production in plant development such as in the seed after germination and in flowers before the onset of and during flower senescence. Furthermore, the expression studies show that LeENOD 40 is negatively regulated during initiation of lateral root formation, suggesting that the gene plays a role in lateral root formation. In chapter 3 we compare regulation of LeENOD 40 ::GUS and GmENOD 40 ::GUS expression in a legume and a non-legume background. Our studies show that LeENOD 40 ::GUS and GmENOD 40 ::GUS expression are similarly regulated in non-legumes. We also show that LeENOD 40 ::GUS is expressed in similar nodular tissues as the endogenous ENOD 40. In chapter 4 we investigate the effect of ectopic expression of GmENOD 40 (35 S::GmENOD 40) on tomato development in transgenic tomato plants. Preliminary studies show that ectopic expression of GmENOD 40 causes an increase in flower and leaf size in 2 transgenic tomato plants. The leaves and flowers of these plants contain cells larger than wild-type cells in the epidermis. In chapter 5 we investigate whether we can assign a function to the peptide encoded by ENOD 40 by searching for protein binding partners for the peptide. For this we used the yeast Two-Hybrid system to screen a cDNA library of young pea nodules. This resulted in the isolation of Ps-p 40, a pea homologue of the ribosomal protein p 40. In situ hybridisation studies show that the expression sites of p 40 and ENOD 40 partly overlap in nodules. Further investigation is necessary to confirm or disprove the interaction between p 40 and ENOD 40. In the concluding remarks of this thesis (chapter 6) we discuss a possible function of ENOD 40 and we discuss whether ENOD 40 represents a gene that is recruited during evolution for nodule formation...|$|R
