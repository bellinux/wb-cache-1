50|$|The {{function}} of the <b>boot</b> <b>jack</b> can be approximated {{with a variety of}} other objects that may be on hand, ranging from a convenient piece of furniture to a rifle butt, but these generally cannot remove the boot as easily as a proper <b>boot</b> <b>jack.</b> An adequate naturally occurring bootjack is formed by the base of cabbage palm Sabal palmetto leaf and these leaf bases are consequently called bootjacks. Additionally, the sole of a boot still being worn can also function as an improvised jack, but the wearer using one foot to remove the opposite boot often lacks proper leverage to successfully remove a snug-fitting boot, particularly a tall boot.|$|E

50|$|A <b>boot</b> <b>jack,</b> {{sometimes}} {{known as}} a boot pull, is a small tool that aids in the removal of boots.

The road passes through rural residential areas, curving west into {{a mix of}} farmland, woodland, and homes. The route becomes Main Street and runs through the community of Kersey, where it passes residences and a few businesses. PA 948 becomes West Main Street Extended and heads west-northwest into wooded areas with some fields and development, becoming Shelvey Summit Road and passing through Shelvey. The road heads west between agricultural areas {{to the north and}} woodland to the south before heading into more wooded areas with some homes, curving northwest. The route heads into Ridgway Township and becomes Kersey Road, heading between woods to the northeast and farmland to the southwest with some development.

From here, the two routes wind northwest and descend a forested hill with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes, entering Ridgway.

A short distance later, PA 948 intersects the northern terminus of PA 949. The road turns west and crosses the Clarion River, becoming West Main Street and passing more homes and businesses. The route turns north onto Montmorenci Avenue, crossing a Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad line and continues through residential areas, heading north-northwest. PA 948 heads back into Ridgway Township and becomes Montmorenci Road, running through farmland and woodland with some homes. The road heads north through more rural areas, turning northwest at Montmorenci. The route heads into dense forests, crossing into Jones Township and becoming Highland Road. PA 948 curves more to the west-northwest and enters the Allegheny National Forest before heading into Highland Township and becoming an unnamed road. The road continues through more forests with some fields and homes, passing through Highland. The route comes to an intersection with PA 66 and the two routes continue west through more of the Allegheny National Forest. The road curves west-northwest and passes through Russell City before PA 66 splits to the west at Chaffee. Past this, the road continues through more forest.|$|E
