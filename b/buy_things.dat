5|$|On the {{day after}} Yuichi's return, he is out with Nayuki who is showing him around city. Nayuki remembers {{that she has to}} <b>buy</b> <b>things</b> for dinner, but Yuichi is {{reluctant}} to go into the store with her. Moments after Nayuki leaves him waiting on the sidewalk, a strange girl named Ayu Tsukimiya collides with him with little warning. Upon recovering, she drags him away to a nearby café and confesses to inadvertently stealing a bag filled with taiyaki after being accidentally scared away by the salesman before she had a chance to pay. They decide to meet up again another day and Ayu scampers off. A few days after he has been in the city, Yuichi is accosted by a girl named Makoto Sawatari who has lost her memories, though still remembers that she has a grudge against him from when he last visited the city.

5|$|Ned {{invites the}} Simpson family to a {{barbecue}} party and announces {{his plans to}} open a store for left-handed people; The Leftorium. During the pulling of a wishbone, Homer, who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, wishes for The Leftorium to be a failure and go out of business. Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts to regret what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the family living in their car. Homer wrestles with the guilt his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open the store for one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel to the store and <b>buy</b> <b>things.</b> The increase in customers helps Ned keep the store open and get his house back.|$|E
25|$|Status has {{far more}} {{relevance}} {{than in previous}} games. Now, many kinds of weapon, ship, and factory are not purchasable until the player has earned sufficient reputation with the vendor race. With some races, reputation can be earned through trade; with others, the player must earn respect by killing unwanted visitors in the race's space - such as pirates, Khaak, or Xenon. Some races appreciate both. By choosing to be an upstanding citizen, the player can earn {{the right to buy}} powerful new weapons, ships and technologies. By engaging in piracy, destruction, smuggling or other crime the player may lose reputation, and so may lose the privilege to <b>buy</b> <b>things.</b> The persistent wrongdoer may lose the right to land at stations, or even to enter sectors, being attacked on sight. Eventually, the player may find it impossible to buy many of the game's most powerful ships, weapons and technologies (although such things may still be possible to acquire through less orthodox means).|$|E

2500|$|US {{consumers}} <b>buy</b> <b>things</b> like {{corn flakes}} where {{the cost of}} the corn per box is around 5 cents. Most of the cost is packaging, advertising, shipping, etc. [...] Only about 19% of the US retail food prices {{can be attributed to the}} actual cost of food inputs like grains and oilseeds. [...] So if the price of a bushel of corn goes up, there may be no noticeable impact on US retail food prices.

2500|$|In {{his closing}} remarks, Reagan asked viewers: [...] "Are you better off now {{than you were}} four years ago?

Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions 'yes', why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on {{for the last four years}} is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have." ...|$|E
