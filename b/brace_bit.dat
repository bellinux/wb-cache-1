25|$|Spoon bits are the {{traditional}} boring tools {{used with a}} brace. They should never be used with a power drill of any kind. Their key advantage over regular <b>brace</b> <b>bits</b> and power drill bits is that {{the angle of the}} hole can be adjusted. This is very important in chairmaking, because all the angles are usually eyeballed. Another advantage is {{that they do not have}} a lead screw, so they can be drilled successfully in a chair leg without having the lead screw peek out the other side.|$|R
50|$|Bungholes {{were first}} used on wooden barrels, and were {{typically}} bored by the purchaser {{of the barrel}} using a <b>brace</b> and <b>bit.</b> Bungholes can be bored in either head (end) of a barrel or {{in one of the}} staves (side). With the bung removed, a tapered faucet can be attached to aid with dispensing. When barrels full of a commodity were shipped, the recipient would often bore new bungholes of the most suitable size and placement rather than remove the existing bung. Wooden barrels manufactured by specialty firms today usually are bored by the maker with suitable bungholes, since the hobbyists who purchase them for the making of beer, wine, and fermented foods often do not have a suitable <b>brace</b> and <b>bit.</b>|$|R
60|$|For boat-building {{purposes}} {{they purchased}} a good whip-saw, a cross-cut saw, a jack plane, and a draw knife, {{a large and}} a small axe, a hammer, <b>brace</b> and <b>bits,</b> six pounds of assorted nails, several pounds of oakum for calking, and some pitch. To this outfit was added fifty yards of three-quarter-inch rope.|$|R

Under him was the trap-door which gave access to the ballast below, and through this he had bored a neat hole. The yellow chips were still on his clothes.|$|R
50|$|The company {{became one}} of the nation's largest {{wholesale}} enterprises with nationally known quality brands, among which Blue Grass was the most readily recognizable. John Primble knives, developed by an employee of the company, became a Belknap brand with its own division, made in Louisville between 1947 and 1985 by the John Primble Belknap Hardware Co. The Crusader manufacturing brand of Belknap included contractors' shovels, hammers, hatchets, axes, drawing knives, carpenters' pincers, planes, screw drivers, hand drills, wrecking bars, <b>bit</b> <b>braces,</b> auger <b>bits,</b> chisels, pliers, wrenches, tin snips, and tin ceilings. Other popular Belknap manufactured products included rifles, guns, padlocks, lawn mowers, and bicycles. Belknap inventory in the vast warehouse spaces grew larger and larger, and the Belknap neon sign could be seen from miles away.|$|R
60|$|A minute later, his own <b>brace</b> and <b>bit</b> {{carefully}} secreted, {{his hand}} was descending {{on the shoulder of}} a man he could not recognize in the gloom, but who, on his knees and wheezing, was steadily boring into the head of a cask. The culprit made no effort to escape, and when Daughtry struck a match he gazed down into the upturned face of the Ancient Mariner.|$|R
2500|$|The term often {{refers to}} a human-powered crank {{which is used to}} {{manually}} turn an axle, as in a bicycle crankset or a <b>brace</b> and <b>bit</b> drill. [...] In this case a person's arm or leg serves as the connecting rod, applying reciprocating force to the crank. There is usually a bar perpendicular {{to the other end of}} the arm, often with a freely rotatable handle or [...] attached.|$|R
60|$|Much elated, Billy {{left the}} saloon and {{walked along the}} street until {{he came to the}} one general store of the town. After another heart rending {{scrimmage}} with the language of Ferdinand and Isabella he succeeded in making several purchases--two heavy sacks, a <b>brace,</b> two <b>bits,</b> and a keyhole saw. Placing the tools in one of the sacks he wrapped the whole in the second sack and made {{his way back to the}} bank building.|$|R
50|$|The U-shaped part {{is a kind}} of crank. It {{gives the}} brace much greater torque than other kinds of hand-powered drills. A <b>brace</b> and <b>bit</b> can be used to drill much wider and deeper holes than can a geared hand-powered drill. The price of the greater torque is lower {{rotational}} speed; it is easy for a geared hand drill to achieve a rotational speed of several hundred revolutions per minute, but it requires considerable effort to achieve even 100 rpm with a brace.|$|R
50|$|In most braces, {{immediately}} {{behind the}} chuck is a three position gear release which allows ratcheting of the handle when in tight spots. Turning the gear {{release from the}} center position allows ratcheting the brace in the direction needed. Turning the gear release fully clockwise lets it remove wood in a clockwise direction with the ratchet action going counter-clockwise. Placing the gear release fully counter-clockwise then allows turning the <b>brace</b> and <b>bit</b> in a counter-clockwise direction, usually to remove the drill bit from the hole. The center position of the gear release prohibits the ratcheting effect.|$|R
60|$|But he only laid {{a finger}} beside {{his nose and}} {{bestowed}} a wink in my direction. Then he took some ashes from his cigar, wetted his finger, and thus ingeniously removed all appearance of newness from the hole he had made, carefully cleaning up the chips and putting them in his pocket. Finally he concealed the <b>brace</b> and <b>bit</b> and opened the trap, disclosing the rough stones of the ballast. I watched him in amazement as he tore a mattress from an adjoining bunk and forced it through the opening, spreading it fore and aft over the stones.|$|R
60|$|Pulling {{out from}} the wall a folding-bed, Jimmy slid back a panel in the wall and dragged out a dust-covered suit-case. He opened this and gazed fondly at the finest set of burglar's tools in the East. It was a {{complete}} set, made of specially tempered steel, the latest designs in drills, punches, <b>braces</b> and <b>bits,</b> jimmies, clamps, and augers, {{with two or three}} novelties, invented by Jimmy himself, in which he took pride. Over nine hundred dollars they had cost him to have made at ----, a place where they make such things for the profession.|$|R
2500|$|When reaming a pre-bored straight-sided hole, {{the spoon}} bit is {{inserted}} into the hole and rotated in a clockwise direction with a carpenters' brace until the desired taper is achieved. When boring into solid wood, the bit should be started in the vertical position; after a [...] "dish" [...] has been created and the bit has begun to [...] "bite" [...] into the wood, the angle of boring can be changed by tilting the <b>brace</b> a <b>bit</b> out of the vertical. Holes can be drilled precisely, cleanly and quickly in any wood, at any angle of incidence, with total control of direction {{and the ability to}} change that direction at will.|$|R
60|$|Going {{at once to}} {{his room}} Billy withdrew his tools from their hiding place beneath the mattress, {{and a moment later}} was busily engaged in boring holes through the floor at the foot of his bed. For an hour he worked, {{cautiously}} and quietly, until he had a rough circle of holes enclosing a space about two feet in diameter. Then he laid aside the <b>brace</b> and <b>bit,</b> and took the keyhole saw, with which he patiently sawed through the wood between contiguous holes, until, the circle completed, he lifted out a section of the floor leaving an aperture large enough to permit him to squeeze his body through when the time arrived for him to pass into the bank beneath.|$|R
50|$|While the pump-drill and the bow-drill {{were used}} in Western Civilization to bore smaller holes for a larger part of human history, the Auger was used to drill larger holes {{starting}} sometime between Roman and Medieval ages. The auger allowed for more torque for larger holes. It is uncertain when the <b>Brace</b> and <b>Bit</b> was invented; however, the earliest picture found so far dates from the 15th century. It {{is a type of}} hand crank drill that consists of two parts as seen in the picture. The brace, on the upper half, is where the user holds and turns it and on the lower part is the bit. The bit is interchangeable as bits wear down. The auger uses a rotating helical screw similar to the Archimedean screw-shaped bit that is common today. The gimlet is also worth mentioning as it is a scaled down version of an auger.|$|R
50|$|The correct {{use of a}} twybil {{is highly}} specialized, that of rapidly {{clearing}} out mortises. Mortises are rectangular holes used to take a tenon for several forms of joint, most obviously the common mortise and tenon joint. Mortises are always cut so that their long axis is along {{the grain of the}} wood. Traditionally these were first cut by drilling with a <b>brace</b> and <b>bit</b> to mark out each end, then the twybil used to break out the wood between them. The axe edge is used to split the intervening timber away from the sides of the mortise, then the other end to lever out the split block. Their short handle allows them to be easily flipped end-for-end, making for quick working as each blade is used alternately. This is quicker to use than swapping between a chisel and a separate lever, safer than using a carefully sharpened chisel edge for levering.|$|R
50|$|Also in June 2012, Survivors of Symphysiotomy testified {{publicly}} {{before the}} Joint Oireachtas (Select) Committee on Justice. Catherine McKeever, a private patient at the Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda in 1969, told the Committee {{that she did}} not realise what had happened: 'I saw him doctor with an instrument which I thought was a <b>bit</b> <b>brace</b> because my father was a wood turner. I felt a crack … Nobody answered me or said anything'. Margaret Conlan, who was operated upon in 1962 in St Finbarr's Hospital, Cork, testified that she had never been told anything about it: 'My baby’s head was perforated and the baby died… I did not find out the symphysiotomy until I read it in the newspaper'.|$|R
50|$|A ewe neck or {{upside-down}} neck bends upward {{instead of}} {{down in the}} normal arch. This fault is common and seen in any breed, especially in long-necked horses but mainly in the Arabian Horse and Thoroughbred. The fault {{may be caused by}} a horse who holds his neck high (stargazing). Stargazing makes it difficult for a rider to control the horse, who then <b>braces</b> on the <b>bit</b> and is hard-mouthed. A ewe neck is counter-productive to collection and proper transitions, as the horse only elevates its head and doesn't engage its hind end. The horse's loins and back may become sore. The sunken crest often fills if the horse is ridden correctly into its bridle. However, the horse's performance will be limited until proper muscling is developed.|$|R
5000|$|Timber framing and [...] "post-and-beam" [...] {{construction}} are {{methods of}} building with heavy timbers (posts and beams) rather than dimensional lumber such as 2x4s. Traditional timber framing is {{the method of}} creating structures using heavy squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs (larger versions of the mortise and tenon joints in furniture). It is commonplace in wooden buildings from the 19th century and earlier. The method comes from making things out of logs and tree trunks without modern high tech saws to cut lumber from the starting material stock. Hewing with broadaxes, adzes, and draw knives and using hand-powered braces and augers (<b>brace</b> and <b>bit)</b> and other laborious woodworking, artisans or framers could gradually assemble a building capable of bearing heavy weight without excessive use of interior space given over to vertical support posts. Since this building method {{has been used for}} thousands of years {{in many parts of the}} world, many styles of historic framing have developed. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details. Three basic types of timber frames in English-speaking countries are the box frame, cruck frame, and aisled frame.|$|R
