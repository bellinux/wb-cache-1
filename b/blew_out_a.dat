5|$|In 1985, Hurricane Gloria <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> {{window of}} the {{monument}}. In 1986, the State of Connecticut spent $6250 to re-mortar the monument. The monument was closed until 1989 for the repair work. In 2007, Carol Kimball of The Day wrote that the State of Connecticut has not funding repairs to the historic site, {{but it would be}} required if the monument were to continue to survive. Kimball also referenced a New York Times article on the neglected monument and that the bond commission has yet to issue the approved $350,000 for its preservation. Other costs including sidewalks surrounding the entrance, and Memorial Gate itself, would require another $150,000 to repair.|$|E
500|$|Aircraft from USN Task Force 38 {{attacked}} the ship on 24 July {{as part of}} a major raid on Kure and the Inland Sea, but she was only hit once. A [...] bomb struck one of the ship's anti-aircraft mounts on the port side. Thirteen men were killed and five wounded, but the bomb did little other damage. A second raid on 28 July did far more damage to the ship as a [...] bomb penetrated the flight deck and detonated in the upper hangar, between the elevators. The explosion <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> [...] section of the port hangar wall and the walls of the upper hangar deck were bulged and perforated multiple times. The flight deck between the elevators was bulged up and buckled; one section of the flight deck out was blown out and flung over to starboard to land across the funnels. Only 13 men were killed (including her executive officer) and another 12 men were wounded during the attack.|$|E
2500|$|Karl Heise {{returned}} from Rumbula to the Riga ghetto by about 1:00p.m. [...] There {{he discovered that}} about 20 Jews too sick to be moved had been taken not to the murder site but rather to the hospital. [...] Heise ordered they {{be taken out of}} the hospital, placed on the street on straw mattresses and shot in the head. [...] Killers of the patients in the street included members of the Schutzpolizei, Hesfer, Otto Tuchel, and Neuman, among others. There were still the hundreds of bodies left from the morning's forced evacuation. [...] A squad of able-bodied Jews was delegated to pick them up and take them to the Jewish cemetery using sleds, wheelbarrows and horse carts. Not every one who had been shot down in the streets was dead; those still alive were finished off by the Arajs commando. [...] Individual graves were not dug at the cemetery. [...] Instead. using dynamite, the Nazi <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> large crater in the ground, into which the dead were dumped without ceremony.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: People with facial {{movement}} {{disorders are}} instructed to perform various facial movements {{as part of}} their physical therapy rehabilitation. A difference in the movement of the orbicularis oris muscle has been demonstrated among people without facial nerve impairments when instructed to “pucker your lips” and to “blow, as if <b>blowing</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> candle. ” The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether the within-subject difference between “pucker your lips” and “blow, as if <b>blowing</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> candle” found in people without facial nerve impairments is present in people with facial movement disorders...|$|R
2500|$|In 1975, President Isabel Perón, under {{pressure}} from the military establishment, appointed Jorge Rafael Videla commander-in-chief of the Argentine Army. [...] "As many people as necessary must die in Argentina so that the country will again be secure", Videla declared in 1975 in support of the death squads. He was one of the military heads of the coup d'état that overthrew Isabel Perón on 24 March 1976. In her place, a military junta was installed, which was headed by Admiral Emilio Eduardo Massera, who stepped out in September 1978, General Orlando Agosti and Videla himself. On 13 January 1976, left-wing guerrillas set fire to a Buenos Aires commuter train after forcing passengers to descend at gunpoint. On 2 February 1976 about fifty Montoneros attacked the Juan Vucetich Police Academy in Buenos Aires in an attempt to capture the helicopter-gunships there, but were repelled in heavy fighting. In the week preceding the military coup, the Montoneros killed 13 policemen as part of its Third National Military Campaign. On 15 March, a powerful guerrilla bomb exploded next to the Argentine Army Headquarters, smashing windows in the nearby Casa Rosada and wounding 15 military personnel and 6 civilians as well as killing a civilian passerby. During 1976, Videla himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in which a time bomb planted in the reviewing stand at the vast Campo de Mayo barracks <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> meter-wide hole at the exact spot where he had been standing.|$|E

60|$|These were eerie, disturbing, {{alarming}} {{sounds in}} the dead stillness of the air around me. All the instances I had heard of topmasts being whipped <b>out</b> of <b>a</b> ship while there was not wind enough on her deck to <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> match rushed into my memory.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am nervous but rational," [...] he said, <b>blowing</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> thin {{cloud of}} smoke. [...] "My nerves {{tell me that}} there is {{something}} prowling up and down the long passage outside; my reason tells me that it is all nonsense. Where are my cards?" ...|$|R

500|$|The tone of {{the songs}} shifts after the first verse, growing more defiant, and the second verse of the song criticizes the {{violence}} under apartheid, with Gabriel singing about trying to sleep but being able to [...] "only dream in red" [...] because of his anger at the death of black people. The lyrics of the third verse seek to motivate the listener: [...] "You can <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> candle/But you can't <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> fire/Once the flames begin to catch/The wind will blow it higher", suggesting that though Biko is dead, the movement against apartheid would continue. The lyrics express a sense of outrage, {{not only at the}} suffering of people under apartheid, but at the fact that that suffering was often forgotten or denied.|$|R

60|$|The {{little boys}} in the front bedroom had thrown off their {{blankets}} and lay under the sheets. It was hot; rather sticky and steamy. Archer lay spread out, with one arm striking across the pillow. He was flushed; and when the heavy curtain <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> little he turned and half-opened his eyes. The wind actually stirred the cloth on the chest of drawers, and let in a little light, so that the sharp edge of the chest of drawers was visible, running straight up, until a white shape bulged out; and a silver streak showed in the looking-glass.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so, Calthy," [...] said Lanigan; [...] "that's so." [...] He {{was in high}} {{good humor}} at the turn the {{conversation}} had taken, but {{did his best to}} repress his inclination to show it. [...] "It might be well to go in for improvement. I'll do that, anyway." [...] Lanigan <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> long whiff of purple smoke. [...] "Calthy is a deep one," [...] he said to himself; [...] "she wants me to draw off that girl from the old man. But all right, my lady; you tackle him and I will tackle her. That suits me beautifully." ...|$|E
60|$|One {{morning the}} Doctor arose as usual, and after breakfast (at which he ate nothing, {{and even after}} filling his coffee-cup half with brandy, half with coffee, left it untouched, save sipping {{a little out of}} a teaspoon) he went to the study (with a rather {{unsteady}} gait, chiefly remarkable because it was so early in the day), and there established himself with his pipe, as usual, and his medical books and machines, and his manuscript. But he seemed troubled, irresolute, weak, and at last he <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> volley of oaths, with no apparent appropriateness, and then seemed to be communing with himself.|$|E
