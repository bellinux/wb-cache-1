40|$|Two parrot species, Tanimbar corella Cacatua goffini and <b>blue-streaked</b> <b>lory</b> Eos reticulata, {{endemic to}} the Tanimbar Islands, Indonesia, were {{regularly}} trapped and sold {{into the international}} wild bird trade prior to 1992. Following concerns about numbers entering into the trade, but with little knowledge of the remaining wild population or socio-economic role of bird trapping on the islands, international trade in both species was suspended at the 1992 CITES meeting. This paper reports on a rapid survey conducted on the islands in 1993 as a follow-up to the decision on trade. The survey attempted to determine {{the status of the}} wild populations, the distribution and activity of the human population, the interaction between Tanimbar corella and agriculture, and the structure of the local commodity-chain for wild-caught parrots. We found that: (a) both parrot species were widely distributed and present at relatively high densities across the largest island in the group, Yamdena; (b) catching of parrots is geographically limited; (c) in the case of Tanimbar corella, at least, the catching is of birds raiding crops and probably involves mainly immature and non-reproductive birds; (d) the international and domestic ban on catching was generally adhered to locally but the reasons for the ban were not widely understood, contributing to a general mistrust of conservationists that still remains. Although not advocating a lifting of the ban on trapping, we do conclude that in this case invoking the precautionary principle without proper consideration of local context may have been counter-productive to conservation goals.

40|$|The {{survey was}} carried out to know {{some aspects of the}} bird trade in Bali on May 2002, {{especially}} to observe the diversity and abundance of species of Psittacidae Family along with their problems. The survey was done by direct observations and interview to the traders in the Sanglah and Satria Bird Markets, Denpasar-Bali. The total of 80 spescies of birds were traded in Bali and most of them i. e. : 75 species or 1577 individuals were found in the Satria bird market, but only 37 species or 393 individuals traded in the Sanglah bird market. Psittacidae family was found more abundantly, i. e. : 428 individiuals in 13 species of parrots. Those spesies of parrots were: Violet-necked Lory (Eos squamata), <b>Blue-streaked</b> <b>Lory</b> (E. reticulata), Red Lory (E. bornea), Rainbow Lorikeet (Trichoglossus haematodus), Chattering Lory (Lorius garrulus), Cockatail Australia (Nymphicus hollandicus), Moustached Parrakeet (Psittacula alexandri), Peach-faced Lovebird (Agapornis roseicollis), Fischerâ€™s Lovebird (A. fischeri), Masked Lovebird (A. personata), Bali Hanging Parrot (Loriculus pusillus) and Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus). The Rainbow Lorikeet was found more abundant than another species of parrots, but Bali or Javan Hanging Parrot was very rare. The most catching area of Psittacidae was about 45...|$|E
