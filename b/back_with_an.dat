5|$|At {{the turn}} of the year, Johnson was subject to {{interest}} from First Division club Nottingham Forest. An initial £2.5million bid was turned down on 4 January 2001, but Forest came <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> improved bid of £3.5million, and the transfer was completed on 12 January 2001. He made his debut two days later in a 3–0 home defeat to Crystal Palace. He scored just two goals in the remainder of the season, the first against Grimsby Town on 24 February 2001, and the second against Sheffield United on 10 March.|$|E
5|$|A {{victory over}} San Francisco gave the Browns 10 wins {{in a row}} to start the regular season. The game was eagerly {{anticipated}} by both sides: San Francisco had started the season with 10 victories, while the Browns had won their first nine games. The 49ers relied heavily on their offense, which featured quarterback Frankie Albert and end Alyn Beals. The team came into the matchup with the Browns averaging 35.9 points per game. The Browns, meanwhile, were more proficient than the 49ers on defense and in placekicking: the team ranked first in the AAFC in fewest points allowed, and Groza held the league record for the longest field goal. The game began with a San Francisco fumble of Cleveland's opening kickoff that was recovered by Lou Saban. Several plays later, Graham ran 14 yards for a touchdown, giving the Browns their first points. San Francisco responded later in the period with a rushing touchdown by Joe Perry to tie the score. Cleveland struck <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Edgar Jones touchdown in the third quarter, however, and held {{on to win the}} game 14–7. Ara Parseghian was a standout on both offense and defense, batting down several of Albert's passes. The crowd of 82,769 set a professional football record. While Cleveland won, several key players suffered injuries. Speedie had a separated shoulder, while linebacker Bill Willis was kicked in the face and Tommy James hurt his ankle. Graham had his hand stepped on, and guard Weldon Humble suffered a chin injury.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test at Trent Bridge, McCabe made 65 in {{the first}} innings before scoring 88 in the second innings to extend Australia's first innings lead from 106 to a target of 380. The hosts fell short by 238 runs. Between Tests, McCabe {{registered}} his fifth century of the season, making an unbeaten 105 in the second innings as Australia defeated the Gentlemen of England by eight wickets. McCabe then scored 34 and 19 as England struck <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> innings victory at Lord's. Between Tests, he took 4/24 in a six-wicket win over Surrey. He then scored his first Test century on English soil during the high-scoring draw in the Third Test at Old Trafford, compiling 137 and 33 not out. The hosts gave McCabe a taste of his own medicine, {{and he had to}} bowl 45 overs for a match total of 1/133, as England's batsmen totalled 10/750 for the match.|$|E
50|$|The seventh {{match was}} between Dustin Runnels and Val Venis (accompanied by Terri Runnels). Venis {{performed}} a spinebuster, but Runnels came <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> powerbomb. Venis knocked Runnels outside and attacked Runnels. As they re-entered the ring, Runnels performed a back body drop, but Venis fought <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Russian legsweep, and applied the camel clutch. Runnels blocked a suplex {{into his own}} suplex, but Venis came <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> chinlock. Runnels fought <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> DDT and climbed the turnbuckles, but Venis threw him to the outside. They then {{went back and forth}} until Venis performed a powerslam, several elbow drops, and pinned Runnels after a Money Shot.|$|R

5|$|The {{body can}} be divided into three parts – the cephalon (head), the pereon (thorax), and the abdomen. The pereon {{comprises}} most of the length of the body. It is divided into seven segments known as pereonites. The rounded and smooth cephalon is fused to the first pereonite; while the highly reduced and almost invisible abdomen is attached to the posterior of the seventh pereonite. In males the first two pereonites are elongated, with the second pereonite being the longest of all the pereonites. They are densely covered with long setae (bristles), giving them a hairy appearance. The second pereonite also has two to three pairs of spines on the <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> additional two pairs at the sides near the base of the limbs. The remaining pereonites (third to seventh) lack the dense setae of the first two pereonites. The third pereonite has seven pairs of spines at the back while the fourth pereonite has eight pairs. Both have three to seven pairs of spines near the base of the gills. The fifth pereonite has five pairs of back spines and a pair of spines at the sides. The sixth and seventh pereonites each have two pairs of back spines, situated at their centers and near the posterior. Females differ from males in having much shorter pereonites which lack the dense covering of setae. The cephalon and first pereonite also possess a single pair of spines each, though they can sometimes be absent.|$|E
5|$|With only 4:25 {{remaining}} and a lead well in hand, Stanford {{began running}} down the clock by executing running plays, which keep the game clock running {{as long as the}} ball carrier is downed in the field of play. Three rushes gained Stanford 16yards, but the effectiveness of this strategy was undermined by a 15-yard personal foul penalty against Stanford that prevented the Cardinal from gaining a first down. Stanford also accepted a delay of game penalty in order to squeeze as much time as possible from the clock before punting back to Virginia Tech. The final drive of the game began from the Tech 11-yard line with 2:10 remaining, and quarterback Taylor controlled the ball on all of its five plays. Taylor completed a five-yard pass to Coale, then ran for 18yards and a first down. He was then sacked for a 15-yard loss, but gained much of that <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> 11-yard run. On the game's final play, Taylor completed a 17-yard first-down pass to Wilson, who was tackled as the last second ticked off the clock and Stanford clinched a 40–12 victory.|$|E
5|$|Later in April, {{the team}} took two wins at two {{concurrent}} events. In stage 2 at the Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey, Valentin {{took his first}} win {{of the season in}} a field sprint, besting Alessandro Petacchi at the finish. The victory made the younger Iglinsky the race leader for a day before he ceded it to 's Manuel Belletti, winner of stage 3. Later in the race, Zeits made a fortunate breakaway which took nearly 12 minutes over the rest of the peloton. The result put him fourth in the overall standings, 20 seconds clear of the man in fifth, but 10 minutes ahead of the man in sixth. The next day, the Astana squad worked hard to get another breakaway containing Zeits to the finish line first, which resulted him in moving up to second overall. He retained this position to the conclusion of the race. At the Tour de Romandie, Vinokourov won stage 3. He, Mickaël Cherel, and Tony Martin had slipped off the front of the field when the day's principal breakaway was caught, and stayed away to allow a three-up sprint decide the winner, though they had no appreciable time gap over the fast-charging peloton at the finish. Cherel protested the results, feeling that Vinokourov's sprint had illegally impeded him, but race officials upheld the order of finish on the road. Vinokourov felt after this result that he was a strong contender for the overall crown, sitting 32 seconds <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> individual time trial, where pending race leader Pavel Brutt struggles, still to race. He finished the race third, losing time to race champion Cadel Evans in that time trial. He later said he was satisfied with this performance. However, at this race, Kiserlovski was revealed to have worse injuries from his Paris–Nice crash than first thought. An MRI taken after the Romandie prologue, due to the Croatian suffering from severe shoulder pain, revealed that he had a cracked vertebra. He abandoned the race with hopes of recovering in time for the Giro d'Italia. Vinokourov had a successful Critérium du Dauphiné. He finished second in the prologue time trial and assumed the race lead the next day on the first road race stage. He held the jersey for a second day before losing it in the stage 3 time trial, a considerably longer course than the prologue. He finished a distant 14th, having difficulty on the technical descents on the course, and slipped to fourth overall. When Janez Brajkovič faltered in stage 6, Vinokourov re-assumed a podium position, third, and kept it to the race's conclusion the next day.|$|E

5|$|While the Grand Prince is away in Lithuania, his power-hungry {{younger brother}} forms an {{allegiance}} {{with a group}} of Tatars and raids Vladimir. We see flashbacks of the Grand Prince and his brother attending a religious service in the church, and see the rivalry and animosity between them. The invasion of the combined armed forces on horseback and the resulting carnage is shown in great detail. The city is burned, the citizens are murdered and women raped and killed. One scene shows a horse falling from a flight of stairs and being stabbed by a spear. Another shows a cow being set on fire. Foma narrowly escapes being killed in the city and escapes into the nearby countryside, but as he is crossing a river he is shot in the <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> arrow and killed. The Tatars force their way into the barricaded church, now fully decorated with Andrei's paintings, where the majority of the citizens have taken refuge. The Tatars show no mercy and massacre the people inside and burn all the painted wooden altarpieces. Andrei saves Durochka from being raped by killing a Tatar with an axe. The Bishop's messenger is cruelly tortured to make him reveal the location of the city's gold, which he refuses to do. After being repeatedly burned, he has liquid metal from a melted crucifix poured into his mouth and is dragged away tied to a horse. In the aftermath only Andrei and Durochka are left alive in the church. Andrei imagines a conversation with the dead Theophanes the Greek, lamenting the loss of his work and the evil of mankind, while Durochka distractedly plaits the hair of a dead woman. Andrei decides to give up painting and takes a vow of silence to atone for killing another man.|$|E
25|$|Collins {{indicated}} in interviews that Going Back {{would most likely}} be his final project, {{and that he was}} considering retirement from music permanently. This was confirmed in 2011, but 4 years later, in October 2015, Collins announced that he had come out of retirement. A 2-disc reissue of the album entitled The Essential Going <b>Back</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> altered track list and live songs was released on 10 June 2016.|$|E
25|$|Cammarano {{advised the}} {{composer}} {{to avoid a}} story which had any sort of revolutionary tinge, and he came <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> idea which Verdi himself had once proposed in 1846 for adapting Schiller's Kabale und Liebe when he was recovering from his illness and {{in the company of}} Andrea Maffei (who was writing the libretto for I masnadieri). Therefore, he sent a synopsis of Luisa Miller (which he called Eloisa Miller) to Verdi on 14 May 1849.|$|E

As a result of that injury, she was confined to bed for three months. Although she seemed to have recovered, and was able to move around for over a decade thereafter, the complications from that incident eventually confined her to bed for 28 years, from April 1934 to the end of her life.|$|E

When the Scarlet Witch's reality is eventually undone, Hawkeye is still presumed dead. However, the recently formed New Avengers find his bow and arrows {{on the site of}} the old Avengers Mansion, pinning up an article about his death.|$|E

The Misfits came in, and Williams fought them off. Williams {{continued}} to attack Vampiro, and the referee disqualified him after Williams refused to stop. Vampiro won the match, and earned a match with Oklahoma, which started immediately after. Oklahoma had the advantage after Williams' attacks. Vampiro fought <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ura-nage, and beat him down with The Misfits. Vampiro pinned him after a Nail in the Coffin to win the match.|$|E

In 1934 the injury eventually confined her to bed for the remaining 28 years of her life. Her spiritual life was influenced by reading the autobiography of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux and, in 1925, at the age of 28, before becoming bedridden, she offered herself to God as a victim soul.|$|E
25|$|On May 29 {{he faced}} Ralek Gracie, at the Saitama Super Arena in Dream 14.

During the match, the wrestler performed significantly against the young Gracie, but the latter kept dominating, evidencing a training specialized to counter Sakuraba's style. There was controversy {{towards the end of the}} fight, as Sakuraba seemed to have secured a kimura, only to the referee to pause the match to pull up Ralek's pants. The pause allowed the Brazilian to come <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> armbar, which Kazushi escaped to meet a unanimous decision win for Gracie.|$|E
25|$|Four days later, Parma {{travelled}} to Lecce, {{knowing a}} win {{at the weekend}} against Lecce would mathematically ensure safety. With Zaccardo not fit, Rolf Feltscher was afforded a rare start for the away side and Lecce had the better of the early stages before Parma came back into it and deserved the lead they took halfway through the second half. It was top scorer Giovinco who found the net with an excellent free-kick. Lecce could have equalised before Parma doubled their lead with a composed finish from Gabriel Paletta who had sprung the offside trap. Nenad Tomović pulled one <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> accurate header late on and Lecce pressed well late on, but failed to get a point. Parma consolidated their place in 9th position.|$|E

25|$|In 1841, Blue Horse {{was shot}} in the <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> arrow during a {{skirmish}} with the followers of Old Chief Bull Bear, a challenger to his father Old Chief Smoke. Old Chief Bull Bear contemptuously threw dust in the face Old Chief Smoke and challenged to him to a fight. After the Old Chief Smoke refused, Old Chief Bull Bear killed Old Chief Smoke’s favorite horse. Red Cloud, Old Chief Smoke’s adopted son, sought revenge, and later during a fight with Old Chief Bull Bear’s band killed old Chief Bull Bear. Blue Horse, who was with Red Cloud, was wounded during the incident. The Old Chief Bull Bear Incident was significant in Oglala Lakota history and resulted in the splitting of the bands. Nevertheless, Old Chief Smoke adopted Old Chief Bull Bear’s son, Young Bull Bear, and raised him in the Smoke household.|$|E
25|$|On {{the lower}} {{crosspiece}} {{of the central}} cross are back to back statues (géminée) depicting Mary Cléophas, a piéta and Mary Magdalene on one side with Saint John, a statue of the risen Christ and Saint Peter on the other. On the upper crosspiece are two men on horseback, Saint Longinus and Stephaton, the two soldiers {{who were at the}} crucifixion. It was Longinus who pierced Jesus' side so he carries a lance whilst Stephaton carries a sponge as he was the soldier who gave Jesus a sponge soaked in vinegar. On the reverse side of the two horsemen is a depiction of Jesus tied with ropes ("Christ lié"). Jesus hangs from the central cross and is sculpted back to <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Ecce Homo. The crucified Jesus is surrounded by four small angels who are collecting the blood running from his wounds. Note that Jesus was nailed to the cross but the two thieves were tied to their crosses with rope.|$|E
25|$|On {{their first}} drive {{of the second}} quarter, Cleveland managed {{to tie the game}} with McDonald's 47-yard {{completion}} to Ricky Feacher setting up Matt Bahr's franchise playoff record 52-yard field goal.

Plunkett completed five passes {{on the way to the}} end zone, including a pair of 24-yarders to Christensen and Branch, while Allen finished the drive a 2-yard touchdown run to give the Raiders a 10–3 lead. With 2:01 left in the half, Cleveland tied the game at the end of a 76-yard drive with McDonald's 43-yard touchdown pass to Feacher. But aided by Greg Pruitt's 40-yard kickoff return to the Raiders 40, Plunkett was able to get his team into scoring range, completing three passes for 26 yards and rushing for 11. Chris Bahr kicked a 37-yard field goal on the last play of the quarter, giving LA a 13–10 lead going into halftime.|$|E
