50|$|Mark III in 1866-1867 {{eliminated}} the Armstrong forged <b>breech</b> <b>piece</b> and hence fully implemented the Fraser economy design. It consisted of only 4 parts : steel A tube, cascabel, B tube and breech coil. 136 were made.|$|R
5000|$|Mark IV, {{introduced}} 1869, and V {{incorporated a}} thinner steel A tube and 2 breech coils. The explanation for separating the heavy breech coil of Mk III into a coiled <b>breech</b> <b>piece</b> {{covered by a}} breech coil was [...] "the difficulty of ensuring the soundness of {{the interior of a}} large mass of iron".|$|R
5000|$|The Pattern 1905 was a {{built-up}} gun {{which consisted}} of an A tube, three layers of reinforcing tubes, a jacket and a <b>breech</b> <b>piece</b> which screwed onto the jacket. [...] Once Obhukov started production the Vickers guns were referred to as model 1 guns, while those manufactured by Obukhov were referred to as model 2 guns. [...] By 1918 {{it was estimated that}} 180 guns had been completed with another 20 partially complete. A few more were finished between 1921-24 from existing stocks.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 5, Nos. 200 - 286, was a 50 caliber naval gun of a {{simplified}} construction {{by combining the}} <b>breech</b> <b>piece</b> along with the chase hoop into one long tube that was shrunk on from the muzzle. Mod 1 was a Mod 0 gun that was relined with a conical nickel-steel liner and an additional gun-steel chase hoop that extended to the muzzle that was secured by a nickel-steel locking ring. Mod 2, gun No. 280, had a slightly different liner with Mod 3, gun No. 245, was a Mod 0 gun with its gun-steel tube replaced with a nickel-steel tube with a gun-steel chase hoop added that extended {{all the way to}} the muzzle. The Mod 3 gun had a longer chase hoop and shorter jacket compare to Mods 1 and 2.|$|R
50|$|The {{locking system}} {{features}} a locking block hinged from the bolt and {{housed in the}} bolt carrier that contains two locking lugs which descend into and engage locking shoulders in the receiver's internal guide rails. The weapon is unlocked by the short tappet-like stroke of the piston rod as it strikes the bolt carrier and drives it rearwards. After 22 mm of unrestricted travel, a wedge-like surface on the bolt carrier moves under the <b>breech</b> locking <b>piece</b> and lifts it {{up and out of}} engagement with the locking recesses in the steel body. The <b>breech</b> locking <b>piece</b> swings up and this movement provides the leverage required for primary extraction. The breech block is then carried rearwards extracting the empty cartridge casing from the chamber. A fixed ejector passes through a groove cut in the underside of the bolt and the case is flung upwards clear of the gun.|$|R
6000|$|He tied up his <b>breeches</b> with a <b>piece</b> {{of string}} which {{was lying on}} the pavement, and, his hands being now free, placed them in a couple of rents which served as pockets, and began to whistle. He was not a proud boy, and was quite willing to take a lesson even from the humblest. Surely he was as useful as a dog! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will go {{at once to}} {{the kitchen}} to prepare your dinner. You will find it {{something}} of a job to get all the Fuddles together, so I advise you to begin on the Lord High Chigglewitz, whose first name is Larry. He's a bald-headed fat man and is dressed in a blue coat with brass buttons, a pink vest and drab <b>breeches.</b> A <b>piece</b> of his left knee is missing, having been lost years ago when he scattered himself too carelessly. That makes him limp a little, but he gets along very well with half a knee. As he is the chief personage in this town of Fuddlecumjig, {{he will be able to}} welcome you and assist you with the others. So it will be best to work on him while I'm getting your dinner." ...|$|R
5000|$|The gun {{was used}} {{extensively}} by Royal Navy ships against land fortifications in the Bombardment of Kagoshima and Bombardment of Shimonoseki in 1863 and 1864. We have two {{descriptions of the}} same incident aboard HMS Euryalus at the Bombardment of Kagoshima in August 1863:"We had on our main-deck 32-pr. 56 cwt. muzzle-loaders; and they, of course, gave no trouble... in the forecastle we had a 7-in. B.L. 110-pr. Armstrong. Whether {{the men in the}} heat of the action became hurried I cannot say; but certain it is that the <b>breech</b> <b>piece</b> of this gun blew out with tremendous effect, the concussion knocking down the whole gun's crew, and apparently paralysing the men, until Webster, captain of the forecastle and of the gun, roused them by shouting: 'Well; is there ere a b----- of you will go and get the spare vent piece?'" [...] -- Letter from an officer of HMS Euryalus to historian William Laird Clowes many years after the event."My opinion, and also that of the gunnery lieutenant, is that for long range they guns, are most successful. The 100-pounder (sic) as a pivot gun is superior to the 95 cwt. solid 8-inch gun but as broadside guns between decks we do not like them; the smoke is too great. Rear choke carriages with such heavy guns are very slow in working and the decks dreadfully cut up. The common shell is one of its great efficiencies, the bursting charge is so great. At Kagosima one vent-piece of the pivot-gun broke and a piece went up to foreyard, but no one was hurt, and it was the fault of the captain of the gun not putting the tin cap in. If the gun is understood and worked properly, it is very successful". -- An officer from HMS Euryalus, published in The Times on 25 April 1864.The guns, while functioning well when correctly handled, were hence seen to be difficult and potentially dangerous to use under the stress of combat.|$|R
60|$|I was {{surprised}} one morning, shortly after, {{to find myself}} the object of marked consideration by a civilian and a stranger. This {{was a man of}} the middle age; he had a face of a mulberry colour, round black eyes, comical tufted eyebrows, and a protuberant forehead, and was dressed in clothes of a Quakerish cut. In spite of his plainness, he had that inscrutable air of a man well-to-do in his affairs. I conceived he had been some while observing me from a distance, for a sparrow sat betwixt us quite unalarmed on the <b>breech</b> of a <b>piece</b> of cannon. So soon as our eyes met, he drew near and addressed me in the French language, which he spoke with a good fluency but an abominable accent.|$|R
2500|$|In any case, Beresford {{could not}} have besieged the {{fortress}} at once because no siege train had been assembled. Apparently, this was an oversight by Arthur Wellesley, Viscount Wellington who failed to issue the necessary orders. The main {{problem was that the}} British army in the Iberian Peninsula had never been provided by the home government with a proper siege train. Therefore, Major Alexander Dickson began forming a siege park from the Portuguese cannons available at Elvas. In the words of historian Charles Oman, [...] "The walls of Elvas were a perfect museum of ancient artillery..." [...] Some of the cannons that Dickson used had dates of 1620, 1636, 1646, and 1652 on their <b>breeches.</b> Even the <b>pieces</b> from the early 1700s were of an obsolete pattern. Most of the gunners were Portuguese, many only half-trained. These were later supplemented by the personnel from British artillery batteries stationed at Lisbon in the companies of Captains Baynes, Bredin, Glubb, and Raynsford.|$|R
