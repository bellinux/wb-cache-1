5|$|The {{decision}} to eschew scripts for storyboards {{is one that}} Hillenburg made {{early on in the}} series' development. Rocko's Modern Life had also used storyboarding, and having worked on that series, Hillenburg felt strongly about adopting the process for SpongeBob SquarePants— even though Nickelodeon was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> greater preference for script-driven cartoons. Another writer for the series, Merriwether Williams, described in an interview that she and Mr. Lawrence would write a draft for an episode in an afternoon and be done at 4 o'clock.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1988, the West Indies had {{experienced}} nearly ten years as the best Test team in world cricket, including a streak of winning 10 of 11 Test series they played from 1980 to 1985–86 (the other was drawn). However, the West Indies side that had enjoyed this considerable recent success was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> signs of ageing. The experienced batsmen Viv Richards (the captain), Gordon Greenidge, Jeff Dujon, and Desmond Haynes were all coming {{to the end of}} their careers, and bowlers Michael Holding and Joel Garner and batsman Larry Gomes had recently retired. As a result, the squad arrived with an unusually inexperienced group of pace bowlers. Supporting Malcolm Marshall, a veteran of 53 Tests, were relative newcomers Courtney Walsh (20 Tests), Patrick Patterson (11), Winston Benjamin (4), Curtly Ambrose (3) and Ian Bishop (0).|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Jasmine (RSMC Nadi designation: 12F, JTWC designation: 10P) was a {{powerful}} and long-lived annular tropical cyclone that affected several countries, particularly Vanuatu and Tonga, over a 16-day span in February 2012. The system was the second cyclone and the only severe tropical cyclone of the relatively quiet 2011–12 South Pacific cyclone season. Cyclone Jasmine developed from an area of disturbed weather on 1February in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Initially, the storm moved towards the east and across the Cape York Peninsula. As it moved across the South Pacific, earlier existing wind shear conditions lessened, and Jasmine began to strengthen at a faster rate. Steadily intensifying, Jasmine reached peak intensity on 8February as a Category 4 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, while <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> annular characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United {{kicked off}} the match, but within the first two minutes they had conceded a goal. A foul on Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy by United captain Roy Keane {{resulted}} in a Liverpool penalty, which Gary McAllister subsequently scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Minutes later, Liverpool were awarded a free kick, but McAllister was unable to score, hitting Manchester United's defensive wall. United had their first chance two minutes later, but Van Nistelrooy miscued his shot in front of goal. In the 11th minute, Liverpool's lead was almost extended as United midfielder Nicky Butt almost diverted a cross from Riise into his own goal. Five minutes later, Liverpool did extend their lead; United defender Jaap Stam slipped after Liverpool striker Emile Heskey headed the ball down to Michael Owen, allowing Owen to sidestep Gary Neville and place his shot into the United goal to make the score 2–0. The frustration of the United players was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> and immediately after the goal, Paul Scholes was shown a yellow card for a challenge on Dietmar Hamann.|$|E

However, in late January 2014, Greater's health deteriorated even further, and {{the decision was made}} to euthanize Greater. At the time of its death, Greater was the only greater flamingo in captivity in Australia; there is a moratorium on the importation of flamingos into Australia.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s {{the excesses}} of the buyout market were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>show,</b> with the {{bankruptcy}} of several large buyouts including Robert Campeau's 1988 buyout of Federated Department Stores, the 1986 buyout of the Revco drug stores, Walter Industries, FEB Trucking and Eaton Leonard. Additionally, the RJR Nabisco deal was showing signs of strain, leading to a recapitalization in 1990 that involved the contribution of $1.7 billion of new equity from KKR.|$|E

25|$|The Escort was a {{commercial}} success in several parts of western Europe, but nowhere {{more than in}} the UK, where the national best seller of the 1960s, BMC's Austin/Morris 1100 was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> its age while Ford's own Cortina had grown, both in dimensions and in price, beyond the market niche at which it had originally been pitched. It also competed with the Vauxhall Viva, and from early 1970 the Rootes Group's Hillman Avenger.|$|E
25|$|New {{models are}} <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> how kinetic {{friction}} can {{be greater than}} static friction. Kinetic friction is now understood, in many cases, to be primarily caused by chemical bonding between the surfaces, rather than interlocking asperities; however, in many other cases roughness effects are dominant, for example in rubber to road friction. Surface roughness and contact area affect kinetic friction for micro- and nano-scale objects where surface area forces dominate inertial forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy in}} America was now <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> signs of {{recovery}} and {{the unemployment rate}} was lowering following the abysmal year of 1938. The biggest shift towards recovery, however, came with the decision of Germany to invade France {{at the beginning of}} WWII. After France had been defeated, the U.S. economy would skyrocket in the months following. France's defeat meant that Britain and other allies would look to the U.S. for large supplies of materials for the war.|$|E

25|$|In 1891, Pennsylvania {{had a major}} {{overhaul}} when her outdated compound engine {{was replaced by a}} new triple-expansion engine supplied by the original builder, William Cramp & Sons. The new engine was smaller, allowing for more cargo space, and was more economical to run. By this time, the ship was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> her age in comparison with newer and more modern vessels, and she no longer carried first class passengers. In the same year, the ship was switched to the less important Antwerp-Philadelphia route, which she maintained until 1898, making her last transatlantic crossing that year.|$|E
25|$|Following {{their second}} album, The Band {{embarked}} {{on their first}} tour as a lead act. The anxiety of fame was clear, as the group's songs turned to darker themes of fear and alienation: the influence on their next work is self-explanatory. Stage Fright (1970) was engineered by musician-engineer-producer Todd Rundgren and recorded on a theatre stage in Woodstock, but the fraying of the group's once-fabled unity was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>show.</b> As on their previous, self-titled record, Robertson was credited {{with most of the}} songwriting. However, the trademark vocal style of The Band's three lead singers was much less prominent on this work.|$|E
25|$|Rover took a {{controlling}} interest in Alvis in 1965 and a Rover-designed mid-engined V8 coupé prototype named the P6BS was rumoured {{to be the}} new Alvis model but with the takeover by British Leyland this too was shelved. By the time the TF 21 was launched in 1966, (available, like its predecessors in both saloon and drophead form and with either manual or automatic gearbox), the model was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> its age despite a top speed of 127mph – the fastest Alvis ever produced. With only 109 sold and with political troubles aplenty in the UK car manufacturing business at that time, production finally ceased in 1967.|$|E

25|$|Many {{of the new}} developments, {{fractional}} projects, and vacation suites {{were built}} with sustainable development in mind, and in 2006 the Three Sisters Mountain Village development was recipient of an international award for being the best sustainable development in North America. Unfortunately, new owners of the 'future land assets' of this project defaulted on their financial commitments following the world economic crisis, putting the future development lands into receivership {{in the spring of}} 2009, but this does not affect current developments that are ongoing within the project and long term development will eventually continue under new ownership. In early 2010, several projects are <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> signs of life, and real estate pricing has begun to recover.|$|E
25|$|New {{treatment}} options are {{arising from the}} new oral drug miltefosine (Impavido) which has shown in several clinical trials to be very efficient and safe in visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Recent studies from Bolivia show a high cure rate for mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Comparative studies against pentavalent antimonials in Iran and Pakistan are also <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> a high cure rate for L. major and L. tropica. It is registered in many countries of Latin America, as well in Germany. In October 2006 it received orphan drug status from the US Food and Drug administration. The drug is generally better tolerated than other drugs. Main side effects are gastrointestinal disturbances in the 1–2 days of treatment which {{does not affect the}} efficacy.|$|E
25|$|The {{first record}} of a {{settlement}} in the Dunfermline area was in the Neolithic period. This evidence includes finds of a stone axe, some flint arrowheads and a carved stone ball which was found near the town. A cropmark which is understood to {{have been used as}} a possible mortuary enclosure has been found at Deanpark House, also near the town. By the time of the Bronze Age, the area was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> some importance. Important finds included a bronze axe in Wellwood and a gold torc from the Parish Churchyard. Cist burials from the Bronze Age have also been discovered at both Crossford and Masterton, the latter of which contains a pair of armlets, a bronze dagger and a set necklace believed to have complemented a double burial.|$|E
