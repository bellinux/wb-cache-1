5|$|Early on, it {{was learned}} that {{diseases}} were species specific, {{so there was}} no danger of a disease or virus spreading to other races and potentially causing a pandemic.

5|$|This <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> however, {{it appears}} that the genetic {{variability}} of cultivated N. rajah plants is very small, as all commercially available tissue-cultured plants are thought to belong to just four clones originating from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London, England.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{cancellation}} of the programme in 1982, the Senior Prom remained highly classified into the 21st century. There are rumours that {{a small number of}} Senior Prom aircraft, configured for aerial reconnaissance, were acquired by the United States Air Force, and were used in secret missions over Eastern Europe late in the Cold War, over Iraq during Operation Desert Storm, and over North Korea; there is no official confirmation of this <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Magistrate {{after hearing}} {{the whole of the}} Case {{observed}} that however valuable the books might be from which the leaves found in Mr Accum’s house had been taken, yet the leaves separated from them were only waste paper. If they had weighed a pound he would have committed him for the value of a pound of waste paper, but this not <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> he discharged him.|$|E
5|$|From 1930 to 1934, Wu {{studied at}} the National Central University (later renamed Nanjing University and {{reinstated}} in Taiwan), first in mathematics, but later transferring to physics. She became involved in student politics. Relations between China and Japan were tense at this time, and students were urging the government to take a stronger line with Japan. Wu was elected {{as one of the}} student leaders by her colleagues because they felt that since {{she was one of the}} top students at the university, her involvement would be forgiven, or at least overlooked, by the authorities. That <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> she was careful not to neglect her studies. She led protests that included a sit-in at the Presidential Palace in Nanjing, where the students were met by Chiang Kai-shek.|$|E
5|$|In {{patients}} developing liver failure, a {{liver transplant}} is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. That <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> the criteria have been reassessed, such as onset of symptoms, prothrombin time (PTT), serum bilirubin, and presence of encephalopathy, for determining at what point a transplant becomes necessary for survival. Evidence suggests, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning, {{up to half of}} those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. A follow-up study has shown most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36 hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E

5|$|Red maple is {{also used}} for the {{production}} of maple syrup, though the hard maples Acer saccharum (sugar maple) and Acer nigrum (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple, {{as well as those of}} the Acer saccharinum (silver maple), Acer negundo (boxelder), and Acer platanoides (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.|$|E
25|$|Bogen (1992) {{points out}} that the brain is bilaterally symmetrical. That <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> if Cartesian materialism is true, there might be two Cartesian theatres, so {{arguments}} against only one are flawed. Velmans (1992) argues that the phi effect and the cutaneous rabbit illusion demonstrate that there is a delay whilst modelling occurs and that this delay was discovered by Libet.|$|E
25|$|In the {{simplest}} {{case in which}} H, B1, …, Bn are all atomic formulae, these clauses are called definite clauses or Horn clauses. However, there exist many extensions of this simple case, {{the most important one}} <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in which conditions in the body of a clause can also be negations of atomic formulae. Logic programming languages that include this extension have the knowledge representation capabilities of a non-monotonic logic.|$|E

The original title, The Beggar and the Cripple has been scored out and replaced with The Gloaming.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} of constructivism {{is that it}} holds that the concepts of two different social formations be entirely different and incommensurate. This <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> {{it is impossible to}} make comparative judgements about statements made according to each worldview. This is because the criteria of judgement will themselves have to be based on some worldview or other. If this is the case, then it brings into question how communication between them about the truth or falsity of any given statement could be established.|$|E
25|$|The {{hospitality}} {{offered by}} the Morrells was such that most of their guests had no suspicion {{that they were in}} financial difficulties. Many of them assumed that Ottoline was a wealthy woman. This was far from <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> and during 1927, the Morrells were compelled to sell the manor house and its estate, and move to more modest quarters in Gower Street. In 1928 she was diagnosed with cancer, which resulted in a long hospitalization and the removal of her lower teeth and part of her jaw.|$|E

The localised areas of high magnetic field acted as tiny particle accelerators, causing reactions that ejected neutrons. Modifications attempting to reduce these instabilities failed to improve the situation and by 1956 the fast pinch concept had largely been abandoned. The US labs began turning their attention to the stabilised pinch concept, but by this time ZETA was almost complete and the US was well behind.|$|E
25|$|The historians Tacitus and Cassius Dio depict an overweening, even domineering dowager, {{ready to}} {{interfere}} in Tiberius’ decisions, the most notable instances <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Urgulania (grandmother of Claudius's first wife Plautia Urgulanilla), a woman who correctly assumed that her friendship with the empress placed her above the law, and Munatia Plancina, suspected of murdering Germanicus and saved at Livia's entreaty. (Plancina committed suicide in AD 33 after being accused again of murder after Livia's death). A notice from AD 22 records that Julia Augusta (Livia) dedicated a statue to Augustus {{in the center of}} Rome, placing her own name even before that of Tiberius.|$|E
25|$|William Maloney, who was {{a medical}} doctor, wrote in his 1936 book The Forged Casement Diaries of the {{whispering}} campaign in 1916 performed as a contagious disease infecting people with doubt and confusion and this is recognized by Casement's biographers. This <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> Casement's prosecutor, Lord Chancellor (Smith), showed the diaries to Michael Collins in 1922 with the same purpose and knowing from personal experience that, once infected, Collins would inevitably transmit the infection to his government colleagues in Dublin, only one of whom allegedly had ever met Casement. Collins' uncertainty {{would have been enough}} to dissuade others from pursuing such a distasteful matter. But this would explain why senior officials of the Irish State have always remained ambivalent with regard to the enduring controversy over the authenticity of these highly incriminating documents.|$|E

25|$|The {{evolution}} of earlier tradition established both Peter and Paul as the forefathers {{of the bishops}} of Rome, from whom they received their position as chief shepherd (Peter) and supreme authority on doctrine (Paul). To establish her primacy among the churches of the Western half of the empire, the bishops of Rome relied on a letter written in 416 by Innocent I to the Bishop of Gubbio, to show how subordination to Rome had been established. Since Peter was the only apostle (no mention of Paul) to have worked in the West, thus the only persons to have established churches in Italy, Spain, Gaul, Sicily, Africa, and the Western islands were bishops appointed by Peter or his successors. This <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> then, all congregations had {{to abide by the}} regulations set in Rome.|$|E

25|$|As {{children}} reach adolescence, {{the period}} of time between age 13 and 19, the dynamics of the parent-child relationship change as peer groups are now the focus of attention. An adolescent with cleft lip or cleft palate will deal with the typical challenges faced by most of their peers including issues related to self-esteem, dating and social acceptance. Adolescents, however, view appearance as the most important characteristic, above intelligence and humor. This <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> adolescents are susceptible to additional problems because they cannot hide their facial differences from their peers. Adolescent boys typically deal with issues relating to withdrawal, attention, thought, and internalizing problems, and may possibly develop anxiousness-depression and aggressive behaviors. Adolescent girls are more likely to develop problems relating to self-concept and appearance. Individuals with cleft lip or cleft palate often deal with threats to their quality of life for multiple reasons including: unsuccessful social relationships, deviance in social appearance and multiple surgeries.|$|E
