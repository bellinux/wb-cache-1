50|$|The {{clock was}} {{supplied}} in a mahogany box with <b>brass</b> <b>fitting</b> {{and was very}} much a case of function over form and built to the highest of military specifications including anti magnetic shielding. The clocks were all individually numbered on a brass plaque and ran on 2 AA type batteries, three of which ran the clock and a fourth was used as a back up power source when changing the other batteries and standard running time for a set of batteries was circa 3 years.|$|E
50|$|Ariel sailed from London for Sydney on 31 January 1872, {{but failed}} to arrive. She is assumed by most who knew her to have been fatally pooped - her fine lines always made her at risk of this. Around August 1872 {{the remains of a}} teak-built ship's life-boat {{carrying}} a <b>brass</b> <b>fitting</b> with the gothic-script letter A were found on King Island in Bass Strait. It was believed to have come from the missing vessel, which, if the assumption was correct, probably foundered in the Southern Ocean after rounding the Cape of Good Hope.|$|E

50|$|The {{navigator}} places {{one end of}} {{the main}} staff against his cheek just below his eye. He sights the horizon {{at the end of the}} lower part of the transom (or through the hole in the <b>brass</b> <b>fitting)</b> (B), adjusting the cross arm on the main arm until the sun is at the other end of the transom (C). The altitude can then be determined by reading the position of the transom on the scale on the main staff. This value was converted to an angular measurement by looking up the value in a table.|$|E
50|$|The British soldier {{went to war}} in August 1914 {{wearing the}} 1902 Pattern Service Dress tunic and trousers. This was a thick woollen tunic, dyed khaki. There were two breast pockets for {{personal}} items and the soldier's AB64 Pay Book, two smaller pockets for other items, and an internal pocket sewn under the right flap of the lower tunic where the First Field Dressing was kept. Rifle patches were sewn just above the breast pockets, to prevent wear from the webbing equipment and Enfield rifle. Shoulder straps were sewn on and fastened with brass buttons, with enough space for a brass regimental shoulder title. Rank insignia was sewn onto the upper tunic sleeves, while trade badges and Long Service and Good Conduct stripes {{were placed on the}} lower sleeves. A stiffened peak cap was worn, made of the same material, with a leather strap, <b>brass</b> <b>fitting</b> and secured with two small brass buttons Puttees were worn round the ankles and calves, and ammunition boots with hobnail soles on the feet.|$|E
5000|$|Problems {{with yellow}} brass fittings. There {{have been some}} claimed PEX systems {{failures}} in the U.S., Canada and Europe resulting in several pending class action lawsuits. The failures are {{claimed to be a}} result of the brass fittings used in the PEX system. Generally, builders and manufacturers have learned from these experiences and have found the best materials for use in fittings used to connect pipe with connectors, valves and other fittings. But there were problems reported with a specific type of <b>brass</b> <b>fitting</b> used in connection with installations in Nevada that caused a negative interaction between its mineral-rich hard water and so-called [...] "yellow brass" [...] fittings. Zinc in the fittings leached into the pipe material in a chemical reaction known as dezincification, causing some leaks or blockages. A solution was to replace the yellow brass fittings, which had 30% zinc, with red brass fittings, which had 5% to 10% zinc. It led California building authorities to insist on fittings made from [...] "red brass" [...] which typically has a lower zinc content, and is unlikely to cause problems in the future since problems with these specific fittings have become known.|$|E

5000|$|Commissioned by William Thomas Green Morton, the Original Morton Etherizer {{was used}} on Ether Day {{as a means}} of {{inhalation}} anesthesia. The Etherizer was made of blown glass with <b>brass</b> <b>fittings</b> at the two open ends, a middle chamber, and a mouthpiece. The middle chamber held a sponge that was soaked in ether, and the chamber would create gaseous conditions thereby making inhalants. The two <b>brass</b> <b>fittings</b> serve as ventilation so that the concentration of the gaseous ether the patient would inhale via the mouthpiece gives the appropriate dose to be safely anesthetized. Currently, the original Ether Inhaler and Case are located in the Ether Dome museum's collection and is awaiting repair to reattach three loose pieces.|$|R
