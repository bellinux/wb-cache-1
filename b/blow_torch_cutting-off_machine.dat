This mode of operation, constant cutting velocity combined with different profiles of materials to be cut, exposes the cut-ting saw to variable cutting forces. Therefore, the {{cutting off machine}} is usually set for the worst expected conditions, oth-erwise excessive wear of the saw and machine will occur. Fur-ther, traditional <b>cutting-off</b> <b>machines</b> require the adjustment {{of the position of}} a limit switch in order to automatically detect when the cut of a piece has been completed. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study the application of control algorithms to the process of cutting-off metallic pipes or bars, with variable pro-files, implemented in an industrial <b>cutting-off</b> <b>machine,</b> com-mercially available. The presented algorithms concern real-time cutting control and automatic detection of the cutting end. The algorithms are implemented in a low cost Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), allowing its use in industrial applica-tions without significant increase on machine cost. All algo-rithms were developed having in mind safety issues relative to the operation of the cutting machine in order to prevent catas-trophic failure.

The percentage of 8 % (w/w) and 12 % (w/w) of Dricon® were incorporated into three different board densities (350 kg/m 3, 450 kg/m 3 and 550 kg/m 3) which were fabricated with three resin loadings (w/w) of urea formaldehyde (8 %, 10 % and 12 %). Each of treated and untreated particleboard has been tested with <b>blow</b> <b>torch</b> and fire propagation tests. The fire propagation test was evaluated by using performance index (I), which indicates the level of heat release of the tested boards. <b>Blow</b> <b>torch</b> test resulted the decreasing of sample’s weight loss of the Dricon®’s sample than the control samples.

50|$|Some {{commentators}} {{compared the}} military`s requests with fantastical science fiction.They have repeated {{passages from the}} military briefing documents where the weapon was described as like a long distance <b>blow</b> <b>torch.</b> It was described as being able to erode the morale of enemies by showing the USA {{had the ability to}} set suspects on fire from a distance.

Rattan is generally soaked in water and then moulded to fit a shape.|$|R

50|$|There were initial {{suspicions that}} the disk {{might be an}} archaeological forgery.
