A few months later, {{he was found}} to be hiding at a village house in Kampung Tawakal, Skudai, 40 km from Johor Bahru.

Both the UTK and Special Branch members stormed each of the perimeter of that house while Mas Selamat was sound asleep. However, according to a witness, Mohd Saat Marjo, 57, a villager who lived opposite the fugitive’s home, about 30 masked commandos armed with automatic weapons together with plainclothes Special Branch agents broke through two doors and rushed into the house when Mat Selamat refused to come out and surrender when ordered by the police. The raid and inclusion by the UTK and Special Branch was very organised, giving Mas Selamat no chance to escape. He was handcuffed with his face covered in a dark blue checked cloth before he was swiftly bundled into a police vehicle and taken away. Other JI members, Abdul Matin Anol Rahmat and Johar Hassan, were also arrested together, and the police also seized documents and other paraphernalia that allegedly revealed their planned operation as well as combed the area with <b>bomb</b> <b>detectors</b> to ensure that the house was free of explosives. However, the UTK's involvement in that operation was not highlighted in the media due to the top secret nature of the operations. The arrest was attributed to the Special Branch.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Everyone {{knows that}} being a soldier is a {{dangerous}} job, {{but some of the}} tasks that soldiers are required to do are more dangerous than others. Walking through minefields, deactivating unexploded bombs or clearing out hostile buildings, for example, {{are some of the most}} dangerous tasks a person is asked to perform in the line of duty. What if we could send robots to do these jobs instead of humans? Then, if something went wrong, we'd only lose the money it cost to build the robot instead of losing a human life. And we could always build more robots. Today's modern military forces are using different kinds of robots for different applications ranging from mine detection, surveillance, logistics and rescue operations. In the future they will be used for reconnaissance and surveillance, logistics and support, communications infrastructure, forward-deployed offensive operations, and as tactical decoys to conceal maneuver by manned assets. In order to make robots for the unpredicted cluttered environment of the battlefield, research on different aspects of robots is under investigation in laboratories to be able to do its job autonomously, as efficiently as a human operated machine can do.

5000|$|After the BBC {{reported}} that the British government was to warn foreign governments that the GT200 and other similar devices were [...] "wholly ineffective" [...] at detecting bombs and explosives, General Anupong said that the procurement of more GT200s would be halted if the device was proven to be ineffective, although existing GT200s {{would continue to be}} used for bomb detection purposes. Other senior military figures continued to insist that the device worked as advertised, saying that it had detected explosives, weapons and narcotics in 173 out of 236 incidents, with a success rate higher than 80 percent. Army Spokesperson Sansern Kaewkamnerd insisted that the GT200 units worked with 100 percent confidence and that the Army was ready to prove the units' effectiveness any time, anywhere. Pornthip Rojanasunand, Director of the Central Institute of Forensic Science, also defended the use of the GT200 devices, claiming that they were effective when searching for bombs and even nails under water.

40|$|In recent years, the United States Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) {{have been}} charged with the task of {{scanning}} every cargo container crossing domestic borders for illicit radioactive material. This is accomplished by using gamma-ray detection systems capable of discriminating between non-threatening radioisotopes, such as Cs- 137, which is often used in nuclear medicine, and fissile material, such as U- 238, {{that can be used to}} make nuclear weapons or "dirty" <b>bombs.</b> Scintillation <b>detector</b> systems, specifically thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) single crystals, are by far the most popular choice for this purpose because they are inexpensive relative to other types of detectors, but are still able to identify isotopes with reasonable accuracy. However, increased demand for these systems has served as a catalyst for the research and development of new scintillator materials with potential to surpass NaI(Tl). The focus of a majority of recent scintillator materials research has centered on sintered transparent ceramics, phosphor-doped organic matrices, and the development of novel single crystal compositions. Some of the most promising new materials are glass-ceramic nanocomposites. By precipitating a dense array of nano-scale scintillating crystals rather than growing a single monolith, novel compositions such as LaBr₃(Ce) may be fabricated to useful sizes, and their potential to supersede the energy resolution of NaI(Tl) can be fully explored. Also, because glass-ceramic synthesis begins by casting a homogeneous glass melt, a broad range of geometries beyond the ubiquitous cylinder can be fabricated and characterized. Finally, the glass matrix ensures environmental isolation of the hygroscopic scintillating crystals, and so glass-ceramic scintillators show potential to serve as viable detectors in alpha- and neutron-spectroscopy in addition to gamma-rays. However, for the improvements promised by glass-ceramics to become reality, several material properties must be considered. These include the degree of control over precipitated crystallite size, the solubility limit of the glass matrix with respect to the scintillating compounds, the variation in maximum achievable light yield with composition, and the peak wavelength of emitted photons. Studies will focus on three base glass systems, sodium-aluminosilicate (NAS), sodium-borosilicate (NBS), and alumino-borosilicate (ABS), into which a cerium-doped gadolinium bromide (GdBr₃(Ce)) scintillating phase will be incorporated. Scintillator volumes of 50 cubic centimeters or greater will be fabricated to facilitate comparison with NaI(Tl) crystals currently available.
