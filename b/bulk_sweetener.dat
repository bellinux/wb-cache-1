40|$|Abstract: Noncaloric {{functional}} beverages {{are a key}} segment in {{the rapidly}} growing func-tional food market. Erythritol, an all-natural <b>bulk</b> <b>sweetener,</b> offers sensorial as well as func-tional benefits for use in such beverages. It can improve taste quality by adding body and mouthfeel, and {{it is capable of}} masking unwanted off-flavors often associated with intense sweeteners. In addition, erythritol can strengthen the functional concept since it is noncaloric, noncariogenic, and nonglycemic, and it has antioxidant properties...|$|E
25|$|A cooling {{sensation}} {{is achieved}} through the chemical {{phenomenon of the}} negative enthalpy of dissolution that occurs with <b>bulk</b> <b>sweeteners,</b> such as the sugar alcohols. The enthalpy of dissolution refers to the overall amount of heat that is absorbed or released in the dissolving process. Because the <b>bulk</b> <b>sweeteners</b> absorb heat as they dissolve and have a negative enthalpy, they yield a cooling sensation as they are dissolved in a consumer’s saliva.|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{provide a}} {{comprehensive}} overview of published {{evidence on the}} impact of erythritol, a noncaloric polyol <b>bulk</b> <b>sweetener,</b> on oral health. Methods. A literature review was conducted regarding the potential effects of erythritol on dental plaque (biofilm), dental caries, and periodontal therapy. The efficacy of erythritol on oral health was compared with xylitol and sorbitol. Results. Erythritol effectively decreased weight of dental plaque and adherence of common streptococcal oral bacteria to tooth surfaces, inhibited growth and activity of associated bacteria like S. mutans, decreased expression of bacterial genes involved in sucrose metabolism, reduced the overall number of dental caries, and served as a suitable matrix for subgingival air-polishing to replace traditional root scaling. Conclusions. Important differences were reported in the effect of individual polyols on oral health. The current review provides evidence demonstrating better efficacy of erythritol compared to sorbitol and xylitol to maintain and improve oral health...|$|E
40|$|Erythritol, a {{naturally}} occurring polyol, is gaining attention as a <b>bulk</b> <b>sweetener</b> for human nutrition. Industrially, it is produced from glucose by fermentation. From various studies {{it is known}} to be non-cariogenic. Moreover, it is rapidly absorbed in the small intestine and quantitatively excreted in the urine. Only about 10 % enters the colon. Earlier in vitro experiments showed that erythritol remained unfermented for a fermentation period of 12 h. In order to investigate whether fresh human intestinal microbiota is able to adapt its enzyme activities to erythritol, a 24 h lasting fermentation was carried out under well-standardised in vitro conditions. For comparison maltitol, lactulose and blank (faecal inoculum only) were incubated as well. Fermentation patterns were established by following total gas production, hydrogen accumulation, changes in pH value, SCFA production and substrate degradation. Taking all fermentation parameters into account, erythritol turned out to be completely resistant to bacterial attack within 24 h, thus excluding an adaptation within that period. Since under in vivo conditions more easily fermentable substrates enter the colon continuously, it seems very unlikely that erythritol will be fermented in viv...|$|E
40|$|D-tagatose, a low-calorie <b>bulk</b> <b>sweetener,</b> can be {{produced}} from D-galactose with an L-arabinose isomerase (L-AI) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus. Isolation of L-AI enzyme, intracellularly expressed in Escherichia coli, was studied by means of sonication, by chemical cell disruption and by a combined disruption approach. Conditions for cell disruption through sonication, e. g., sonication time, duty cycle, power and sample volume were determined for the wild type (WT) enzyme which was produced without an inducible expression system. The highest release was observed at a power of 120 W after 5 minutes of sonication with a duty cycle of 50 % and sample volume of 60. 0 mL resulting in a relative L-AI activity of 92. 5 ± 0. 9 %. Chemical cell disruption with 16. 5 mM triton X- 100 for 17 hours gave even better results compared to sonication, namely, a relative L-AI activity in the crude extract of 95. 6 ± 1. 2 %. Additional experiments were performed on cell disruption of the wild type enzyme produced with an inducible expression system (WT i). Treatment of WT i enzyme with 16. 5 mM triton X- 100 for 17 hours led to a lower relative L-AI activity, namely, 84. 0 ± 0. 5 %. A combined approach of a prior chemical lysis with triton X- 100 followed by sonication led to a further increase of L-AI activity towards 89. 6 ± 0. 3 %. </p...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{rheological}} measurements, {{thermal analysis}} and physical properties such as overrun, instrumental hardness and melting behavior on sensorial profile mapping of {{vanilla ice cream}} was evaluated. Samples with different functional characteristics were prepared partially substituting sucrose by <b>bulk</b> <b>sweeteners.</b> Creaminess apart from thermal properties (glass transition temperature-T-g, ice crystal uniformity-Delta T-mcurve and unfrozen water content-UFW) was poorly related with rheological and physical properties. On the contrary, coarseness, wateriness, greasiness and gumminess perception {{were found to be}} well correlated with rheological and thermal properties, overrun, air cells mean size and melting rate. Flavor and taste characteristics were interrelated particularly with melting and thermal characteristics, overrun and air cells mean size. Multivariate exploratory statistical methods revealed that the use of T-g, Delta T-mcurve, UFW, instrumental hardness, and melting rate can be used for the effective discrimination of ice creams differing in their sweetener composition suggesting their importance in the design of novel ice cream formulations.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} in 14 healthy volunteers the gastrointestinal {{tolerance to}} an indigestible <b>bulking</b> <b>sweetener</b> containing fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS). DESIGN: In order to mimic their usual pattern of consumption, FOS were ingested {{throughout the day}} either occasionally (once a week, first period) or regularly (every day, second period). In the two patterns of consumption, daily sugar doses were increased until diarrhoea and/or a symptom graded 3 (i. e. severe) occurred, or when subjects {{did not want to}} ingest more candies. SETTING: Clinical Nutrition Unit, Hôpital Saint-Lazare, Paris. RESULTS: In both periods, the first symptom which occurred was excessive flatus (> 30 g FOS/day) : borborygmi and bloating appeared at a higher level (> 40 g/day); lastly, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea occurred at a very much higher level (50 g/day). The volumes of hydrogen excreted in breath in response to the same load of FOS were not different between the two periods. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic consumption of FOS initiated cautiously with subsequent gradual increase did not improve tolerance, nor reduce breath excretion of hydrogen...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} effect of foods containing high intensity sweeteners on satiation. However, less is known about low-calorie <b>bulk</b> <b>sweeteners</b> such as erythritol. In this randomized three-way crossover study, we studied 10 lean and 10 obese volunteers who consumed three test meals on separate occasions: (a) control sucrose meal; (b) isovolumic meal with partial replacement of sucrose by erythritol; (c) isocaloric meal which contained more erythritol but equivalent calories to the control meal. We measured gut hormone levels, hunger and satiety scores, ad libitum food intake, sucrose preference and intake after the manipulations. There was a greater post-prandial excursion in glucose and insulin levels after sucrose than after the erythritol meals. There {{was no difference in}} GLP- 1 /PYY levels or subsequent energy intake and sucrose preference between sucrose control and isovolumic erythritol meals. In lean (but not obese) participants, hunger decreased to a greater extent after the isocaloric erythritol meal compared to the control meal (p =  0. 003) reflecting the larger volume of this meal. Replacing sucrose with erythritol leads to comparable hunger and satiety scores, GLP- 1 and PYY levels, and subsequent sucrose preference and intake...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: D-tagatose is {{a natural}} low-calorie <b>bulk</b> <b>sweetener</b> (1. 5 kcal/g) showing 92 % of the {{sweetness}} of sucrose. It is low glycaemic, non-cariogenic and has prebiotic properties. Besides this wide range of healthy benefits, D-tagatose can also be applied as flavour enhancer and flavour creator in many applications. Tagatose significantly reduces the lingering sweetness and the bitter and metallic off-flavour of high intensity sweeteners. The natural occurrence of D-tagatose is however too limited for the increasing interest in this alternative sweetener. Chemical production of D-tagatose from D-galactose is economically not feasible due to byproduct formation and complex waste water treatment steps. A biocatalysed process using an immobilised L-arabinose isomerase enzyme for galactose isomerisation is therefore part of this study. Materials and methods: A wild type L-arabinose isomerase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus is used as enzyme source for bioconversion of D-galactose to D-tagatose with Escherichia coli (BL 21) strain as expression host. Cells are harvested from culture broth by centrifugation and are resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7) or ringer solution. Different biomass concentrations are immobilised with 5 % v/v alginate in a 1 / 1 biomass/alginate volumetric ratio. Biomass concentration is varied between 1. 3 and 6. 5 %. Batch conversion experiments are performed in a thermostatic shaking bath at 60 °C. Bead concentration is varied between 10 and 30 %. A galactose solution of 360 g/l is used as substrate, containing 1 mM MnCl 2 as co-factor at pH 7. Samples are analysed by HPLC with refractive index detection. Results and discussion: Tagatose production increases with a higher biomass concentration immobilised in alginate. By varying the biomass concentration from 1. 3 to 6. 5 % at a bead concentration of 20 %, the tagatose concentration obtained after 24 hours increases from 27 to 65 g/l. The increase in tagatose production is however not linearly correlated to the biomass concentration. A similar conclusion can be drawn for {{the influence of the}} bead concentration. At a biomass concentration of 3. 3 % w/v, tagatose concentration increases from 29 to 56 g/l for an increase in bead concentration of 10 to 30 %. No significant influence of the diluent of the biomass is noticed on tagatose production. What’s innovative: An enzymatic bioprocess is developed and optimised for production of D-tagatose from D-galactose. Besides the unique benefits of tagatose for many food applications (low caloric value, low glycaemic, non-cariogenic and prebiotic properties, less lingering artificial sweetener aftertaste), the application of an L-arabinose isomerase for production of D-tagatose results in a highly selective and environmentally friendly production process, which is not yet available on the current industrial market. As sugar substitute, tagatose will help to control weight, tooth decay and will be a major help in comfort of diabetics. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Erythritol is a {{sugar alcohol}} (polyol) with {{potential}} applications as a low-calorie, <b>bulk</b> <b>sweetener.</b> Ingested erythritol is efficiently absorbed and excreted unchanged via the urine {{since it is}} not metabolized systemically by the animal or human body. Erythritol was administered to four groups of 10 male and 10 female Swiss CD- 1 mice and four groups of 15 male Wistar Crl:(WI) WU BR rats at dietary levels of 0, 5, 10, or 20 % for 90 days. A fifth group of rats received a diet containing 20 % erythritol on a time restricted basis (6 hr/day), and a sixth group received a diet containing 20 % mannitol for comparison. There were no treatment related mortalities in either mice or rats. Soft stools and occasional diarrhea were observed in rats fed diets with 20 % erythritol or mannitol but not in mice. Body weights were slightly yet significantly reduced in rats fed 20 % erythritol or mannitol. and in male mice of the 20 % dose group. Erythritol intake in the high dose group was approximately 12 g/kg body wt in rats and 44 and 45 g/kg body wt in male and female mice, respectively. Hematological and clinicochemical examinations of blood and plasma did not reveal any treatment related effects. Urine output increased with increasing erythritol dose. In male and female mice of the 20 % erythritol group, the creatinine normalized urinary excretion of protein, K-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and electrolytes (Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, P(i), citrate) was significantly increased while urinary N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) remained unchanged. At the 10 % level, significantly increased urinary protein (both sexes) and GGT (males only) excretion were seen. In rats, the creatinine-normalized urinary excretion of GGT, NAG, and some electrolytes (Na+, K+, and Ca 2 +) was increased in some erythritol groups but a clear dose-response relationship was evident only for calcium. On termination of the study, cecal enlargement was seen in rats of the 10 and 20 % dose groups and in mice of the 20 % dose group. Increased relative and absolute kidney weights were observed in both sexes of mice in the 20 % erythritol group, in male mice of the 5 and 10 % groups, and in rats of the 10 and 20 % erythritol groups. Histopathological examination did not reveal any treatment-related abnormalities in either mice or rats. In conclusion, the ingestion of erythritol for 90 days at dietary levels of up to 20 % did not produce signs of toxicity in mice or rats. In particular, the morphological integrity of the kidneys was not adversely affected by the treatment in either species. The increases in urinary excretion of protein, GGT, NAG, and electrolytes were considered to result from extensive osmotic diuresis and a potential overload of the renal excretory system at the high dose levels employed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the effect of repeated presentation of the same sweet stimulus on sweetness intensity ratings. The sweet stimuli tested in this study were binary and ternary blends of 14 sweeteners that varied widely in chemical structure. A trained panel evaluated the sweetness intensity over four sips of a given mixture presented at 30 s intervals. The individual components in the binary sweetener combinations were intensity-anchored with 5 % sucrose, while the individual sweeteners in the ternary mixtures were intensity-anchored with 3 % sucrose (according to formulae developed previously). Each self-mixture was also evaluated (e. g. acesulfame-K—acesulfame-K). The main finding of this study was that mixtures consisting of two or three different sweeteners exhibited less reduction in sweetness intensity over four repeated sips than a single sweetener at an equivalent sweetness level. Furthermore, ternary combinations tended to be slightly more effective than binary combinations at lessening the effect of repeated exposure to a given sweet stimulus. These findings suggest that the decline in sweetness intensity experienced over repeated exposure to a sweet stimulus could be reduced by the blending of <b>sweeteners.</b> Key words: <b>bulk</b> <b>sweeteners,</b> high potency, repeated presentation, sweeteners, synergis...|$|R
