The <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulum</b> is still found in physics classrooms today, because of its simplicity and usefulness in demonstrating properties of momentum and energy. Unlike other methods of measuring {{the speed of a}} bullet, the basic calculations for a <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulum</b> do not require any measurement of time, but rely only on measures of mass and distance.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} {{its primary}} uses of measuring {{the velocity of}} a projectile or the recoil of a gun, the <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulum</b> {{can be used to}} measure any transfer of momentum. For example, a <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulum</b> was used by physicist C. V. Boys to measure the elasticity of golf balls, and by physicist Peter Guthrie Tait to measure the effect that spin had on the distance a golf ball traveled.|$|E
40|$|The paper gives {{a survey}} of {{experimental}} methods {{in the field of}} terminal ballistics and impact physics. Described are the principles of electrostatic, electromagnetic, high-explosive and plasma accelerators and of powder-, two-stage light gas- and hybrid two-stage light gas guns. Further points of interest are projectile and sabot techniques as well as the constructive concept for the closed impact ranges. Furthermore, a lot of diagnostic techniques are discussed, e. g. trigger devices, velocity measurement stations, shadowgraph-, Schlieren and Mach-Zehnder systems for flow visualization, high speed cameras and cinematography, flash X-ray arrangements, laser interferometers and <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulums...</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{system to}} {{supplant}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulums</b> with direct measures of projectile speed {{was invented in}} 1808, during the Napoleonic Wars and used a rapidly rotating shaft of known speed with two paper disks on it; the bullet was fired through the disks, parallel to the shaft, and the angular difference in the points of impact provided an elapsed time over {{the distance between the}} disks. A direct electromechanical clockwork measure appeared in 1840, with a spring-driven clock started and stopped by electromagnets, whose current was interrupted by the bullet passing through two meshes of fine wires, again providing the time to traverse the given distance.|$|R
40|$|Investigations were {{conducted}} into unique methods of converting pulsed laser energy into propulsive thrust across a flat impulse surface under atmospheric conditions. The propulsion experiments were performed with a 1 -micron neodymium-glass laser at the Space Plasma Branch of the Naval Research Laboratory. Laser-induced impulse was measured dynamically by <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulums</b> and statically using piezoelectric pressure transducers on a stationary impulse surface. The principal {{goal was to}} explore methods for increasing the impulse coupling performance of airbreathing laser-propulsion engines. A magnetohydrodynamic thrust augmentation effect was discovered when a tesla-level magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the impulse surface. The impulse coupling coefficient performance doubled and continued to improve with increasing laser-pulse energies. The resultant performance of 180 to 200 N-s/MJ {{was found to be}} comparable to that of the earliest afterburning turbojets...|$|R
5000|$|Benjamin Robins (1707-1751) {{invented the}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulum</b> that {{measures}} {{the momentum of}} the projectile fired by a gun. Dividing the momentum by the projectile mass gives the velocity. Robbins published his results as New Principles of Gunnery in 1742. [...] The <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulum</b> could make only one measurement per firing because the device catches the projectile. [...] The gun's accuracy also limited how far down range a measurement could be made.|$|E

40|$|Reaction {{force has}} always been one of the main {{characterization}} parameters for impact events. Today, a set of force transducers are a common and valuable tool to measure reaction forces. But the force signals are often influenced by vibrations of the supporting structures. Many other attempts were already taken in the past to use other methods to measure force, such as <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulums,</b> Hopkinson bars, etc., all having their advantages and disadvantages. In this work, a multi-axial force measurement tool is developed to serve in a test campaign of bird strike experiments on booster vanes. The idea is to give some well-chosen mass three rotational degrees of freedom and acquire the transferred rotational momentum from an optical measurement, which is a direct measure for the impact force. The tool is validated experimentally and numerically using a simplified steel vane. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In blast and impact, {{structures}} usually undergo large plastic deformations or failure, {{and they}} absorb considerable energy. In this paper, {{the characteristics of}} blast loads and corresponding structural response, {{as well as the}} current advances in this area, were briefly reviewed. The concept and effects of blast wave, the main means of blast impact, are introduced. Several critical structural responses are classified and briefly illustrated. The major experimental methods were introduced with a brief description of corresponding experimental devices such as <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulums</b> and a wide range of sensors to measure impulse, pressure and acceleration and displacement of structures. Several commonly used analytical models were presented and compared to estimate the dynamic behaviour of structure under blast loading. The numerical approaches to analyze the structure responses to blast impact were also summarised with a number of available constitutive relations of explosive charge and material properties of structures...|$|R
5000|$|During forward {{acceleration}} {{and before the}} transient mass change in the capacitor decays, the resultant increased momentum is transferred forward to a bulk [...] "reaction mass" [...] through an elastic collision (the brass end cap on the left in the picture). Conversely, the following decrease in the mass density takes place during its backward movement.While operating, the PZT stack is isolated in a Faraday cage {{and put on a}} sensitive torsion arm for thrust measurements, inside a vacuum chamber. Throughout the years, a wide variety of different types of devices and experimental setups have been tested. The force measuring setups have ranged from various load cell devices to <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulums</b> to multiple torsion arm pendulums, in which movement is actually observed. Those setups have been improved against spurious effects by isolating and canceling thermal transfers, vibration and electromagnetic interference, while getting better current feeds and bearings. Null tests were also conducted.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} the results of experimental and analytical studies on the response of steel and aluminium square plates with different thicknesses subjected to blast loading. Based on the blast wave details and the scaling law for explosions, a method of deter-mining the blast load is proposed in which <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulums</b> {{do not need to be}} utilized for obtaining the blast wave impulses. The loads applied to the plates are assumed to be the quasi-exponential pressure pulses, which are the same as the explosion overpressures. The theoretical solutions are presented using a rigid, perfectly plastic idealization and are exact within the context of dynamic plasticity. The dynamic energy imparted to structures can cause material failure. The presented investigation considers such a failure for fully clamped plates subjected to a blast loading idealized as an initial velocity distributed uniformly throughout the area. The predicted deflections and general failure modes of the plates are presented and compared with experimental results. Moreover, a numerical simulation is carried out by mod-elling an FSI (fluid–solid interaction) problem. Results are compared with each other and a better agreement between numerical results with experimental ones is observed...|$|R

In 1844, he invented a device {{for measuring the}} flight speed of projectiles at any point of their trajectory. In 1847 Konstantinov created a <b>ballistic</b> rocket <b>pendulum,</b> which would allow to establish a law of changing rocket motion in time. With the help of this device, {{he was able to}} determine the influence of the form and design of a rocket on its ballistic characteristics, thereby laying the foundations for calculated rocket designs. In 1849 he was appointed commander of the Petersburg Rocketry Department (Петербургское ракетное заведение). In 1861, he supervised the construction of a rocket factory in Nikolayev, which he would head six years later.|$|R

50|$|The art of gunnery {{was put on}} a {{scientific}} basis in the mid 18th century. British military engineer Benjamin Robins used Newtonian mechanics to calculate the projectile trajectory while taking the air resistance into account. He also carried out an extensive series of experiments in gunnery, embodying his results in his famous treatise on New Principles in Gunnery (1742), which contains a description of his <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulum</b> (see chronograph).|$|E
5000|$|In 1742, Benjamin Robins {{invented the}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulum.</b> This {{was a simple}} {{mechanical}} device that could measure a projectile's velocity. Robins reported muzzle velocities ranging from 1400 ft/s to 1700 ft/s. In his book published that same year “New Principles of Gunnery”, he uses numerical integration from Euler's method and found that air resistance “varies as {{the square of the}} velocity, but insists it changes at the speed of sound.” ...|$|E
50|$|Robins {{used the}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulum</b> to measure {{projectile}} velocity in two ways. The first was {{to attach the}} gun to the pendulum, and measure the recoil. Since {{the momentum of the}} gun is equal to the momentum of the ejecta, and since the projectile was (in those experiments) the large majority of the mass of the ejecta, the velocity of the bullet could be approximated. The second, and more accurate method, was to directly measure the bullet momentum by firing it into the pendulum. Robins experimented with musket balls of around one ounce in mass (30 g), while other contemporaries used his methods with cannon shot of one to three pounds (0.5 to 1.4 kg).|$|E
50|$|The {{rest of the}} bullet's {{kinetic energy}} is spent in the {{deformation}} or shattering of the bullet (depending on bullet construction), damage to the target (depending on target construction), and heat dissipation. In other words, because the bullet strike on the target is an inelastic collision, {{only a minority of}} the bullet energy is used to actually impart momentum to the target. This is why a <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulum</b> relies on conservation of bullet momentum and pendulum energy rather than conservation of bullet energy to determine bullet velocity; a bullet fired into a hanging block of wood or other material will spend much of its kinetic energy to create a hole in the wood and dissipate heat as friction as it slows to a stop.|$|E
5000|$|Davis' 1976 article, [...] "Detesters, Phasers and Dean Drives", {{reported}} his {{tests with}} Stine, an engineer who built devices to test {{that aspect of}} the hypothesis. Stine said {{they were able to}} reliably create and reproduce a 3-degree phase angle in a linear system, which was not possible according to ordinary physics. But then they failed to reproduce the effect in a pendulum system, using a rocket-powered <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulum.</b> The pendulum test would have proved beyond doubt that the Drive worked, but Dean refused to subject the original Dean Drive to a pendulum test. Campbell reported that he had seen the Drive subjected to a pendulum test, but Davis and Stine suspect that he only reported what Dean had told him and had never seen the actual test. Davis says the question can't be settled until the pendulum test is made. Their research was terminated in 1965 when the national economy took a downturn, and was never resumed. [...] The 1976 article was an attempt to get research restarted, but apparently failed.|$|E
50|$|A {{change in}} {{momentum}} {{of a mass}} requires a force; according to Newton's first law, known as the law of inertia, inertia simply being another term for mass. That force, applied to a mass, creates an acceleration, which when applied over time, changes the velocity of a mass. According to Newton's second law, the law of momentum -- changing the velocity of the mass changes its momentum, (mass multiplied by velocity). It {{is important to understand}} at this point that velocity is not simply speed. Velocity is the speed of a mass in a particular direction. In a very technical sense, speed is a scalar (mathematics), a magnitude, and velocity is a vector (physics), magnitude and direction. Newton's third law, known as conservation of momentum, recognizes that changes in the motion of a mass, brought about by the application of forces and accelerations, does not occur in isolation; that is, other bodies of mass are found to be involved in directing those forces and accelerations. Furthermore, if all the masses and velocities involved are accounted for, the vector sum, magnitude and direction, of the momentum of all the bodies involved does not change; hence, momentum of the system is conserved. This conservation of momentum is why gun recoil occurs in the opposite direction of bullet projection -- the mass times velocity of the projectile in the positive direction equals the mass times velocity of the gun in the negative direction. In summation, the total momentum of the system equals zero, surprisingly just as it did before the trigger was pulled. From a practical engineering perspective, therefore, through the mathematical application of conservation of momentum, it is possible to calculate a first approximation of a gun’s recoil momentum and kinetic energy, and properly design recoil buffering systems to safely dissipate that momentum and energy, simply based on estimates of the projectile speed (and mass) coming out the barrel. To confirm analytical calculations and estimates, once a prototype gun is manufactured, the projectile and gun recoil energy and momentum can be directly measured using a <b>ballistic</b> <b>pendulum</b> and ballistic chronograph.|$|E
