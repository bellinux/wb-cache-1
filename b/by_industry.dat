5|$|DJ Hero was {{generally}} well received by game journalists, praising the {{departure from the}} Guitar Hero series-style of gameplay, {{the use of the}} turntable controller to simulate the motions of a DJ and how the game's difficulty curve helps the player to become skilled on it, and the game's soundtrack; several smaller issues were identified as potential improvements for a possible sequel. However, the game did not perform as strongly as expected <b>by</b> <b>industry</b> analysts, believed to be due to the waning interest in music games during 2009; regardless, DJ Hero is stated by NPD Group to be the highest-grossing new intellectual property of 2009 in North America.|$|E

5|$|Tantalum is {{estimated}} to make up about 1ppm or 2ppm of the Earth's crust by weight. There are many species of tantalum minerals, only {{some of which are}} so far being used <b>by</b> <b>industry</b> as raw materials: tantalite, microlite, wodginite, euxenite, polycrase. Tantalite (Fe, Mn)Ta2O6 is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction. Tantalite has the same mineral structure as columbite (Fe, Mn) (Ta, Nb)2O6; when there is more tantalum than niobium it is called tantalite and when there is more niobium than tantalum is it called columbite (or niobite). The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method. Other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{his second}} effort that fall, West would invest two million dollars {{and take over}} a year to craft his second album. West was {{significantly}} inspired by Roseland NYC Live, a 1998 live album by English trip hop group Portishead, produced with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip-hop production. Though West {{had not been able}} to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album Late Registration. West collaborated with American film score composer Jon Brion, who served as the album's co-executive producer for several tracks. Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre. Late Registration sold over 2.3million units in the United States alone by the end of 2005 and was considered <b>by</b> <b>industry</b> observers as the only successful major album release of the fall season, which had been plagued by steadily declining CD sales.|$|E

In September 1928 Cronjager became involved in a minor controversy. The film industry was becoming unionized, and Cronjager was resistant to joining. When Dix insisted Cronjager photograph his next film, Moran of the Marines, the union threatened to strike if the cinematographer was hired without becoming a union member. Cronjager joined the union {{at the request of the}} studio, averting the threatened union action. Throughout his career, Dix attempted to have Cronjager as the cinematographer on his films.|$|E
