500|$|He kept a {{reputation}} as an [...] "unusually tall, robust" [...] man throughout his life, with an adult height of about [...] Measurements taken from his uniform show that at his death he had a waist size of [...] and the inside <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat measured [...] in circumference. Though Brock was noted as a handsome man who enjoyed the company of women, he never married.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Edward Dane {{shook his}} head. He was {{fingering}} the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat.|$|E
6000|$|Buck Mulligan at {{once put}} on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had {{suddenly}} withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved a doll's head to and fro, the <b>brims</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice: ...|$|R
6000|$|When they rose, and strolled {{away from}} the bench {{where they had been}} sitting, they seemed to be followed. They looked round and saw no one more {{alarming}} than a very severe-looking old gentleman, whose hat <b>brim</b> in spite <b>of</b> <b>his</b> severity was limp with much lifting, as all Austrian hat brims are. He touched it, and saying haughtily in German, [...] "Something left lying," [...] passed on.|$|R
5000|$|The fate of {{the unfortunate}} David II of Scotland is immortalized in Shakespeare’s play Henry V. In Act 1 Scene 3, Henry says to the Archbishop of Canterbury:For you shall read that my {{great-grandfather}} Never went with his forces into France But that the Scot on his unfurnish’d kingdomCame pouring, like the tide into a breach, With ample and <b>brim</b> fullness <b>of</b> <b>his</b> force; Galling the gleaned land with hot essays, Girding with grievous siege castles and towns; That England, being empty of defence, Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.But the Archbishop replies:She hath been then more fear’d than harm’d my liege; For hear her but exampled by herself: When all her chivalry hath been in France,And she a mourning widow of her nobles, She hath herself not only well defended, But taken, and impounded as a stray, The king of Scots; whom she did send to France, To fill King Edward’s fame with prisoner kings… ...|$|R
60|$|I bowed. Sir Thomas stood very stiffly, {{looking at}} me {{severely}} from under the broad <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Happy to know you, sir.' Mr Folair {{touched the}} <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat with his forefinger, and then shook hands. 'A recruit, sir, I understand?' ...|$|E
60|$|Thorne {{leaned against}} the side of the wagon, though she noticed that he first pulled the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soft hat lower down over his face.|$|E
60|$|The man {{pulled the}} broad <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> a gray hat over his eyes, and answered, rather sullenly, {{that he did}} not come from Parker's Falls, which, as being the limit <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own day's journey, the pedlar had {{naturally}} mentioned in his inquiry.|$|R
60|$|She {{had put her}} {{two hands}} on his shoulder, and her {{forehead}} down on them; the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> her hat touched his neck, and he felt it quivering. But, {{in a sort of}} paralysis, he made no response. She let go <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shoulder and drew away.|$|R
60|$|A little below this {{junction}} we {{made another}} meeting of yet more account. For {{there we were}} joined by the Aisne, already a far- travelled river and fresh out of Champagne. Here ended the adolescence of the Oise; this was his marriage day; thenceforward he had a stately, <b>brimming</b> march, conscious <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own dignity and sundry dams. He became a tranquil feature in the scene. The trees and towns saw themselves in him, as in a mirror. He carried the canoes lightly on his broad breast; {{there was no need}} to work hard against an eddy: but idleness became the order of the day, and mere straightforward dipping of the paddle, now on this side, now on that, without intelligence or effort. Truly we were coming into halcyon weather upon all accounts, and were floated towards the sea like gentlemen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, everything." [...] She stopped, {{and leaning}} forward, {{suddenly}} caught the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soft felt hat, and drawing it down smartly over his audacious eyes, said, [...] "Everything BUT THAT." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please, mum," [...] said he, {{touching}} the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wreck of a hat, [...] "measter seed ye coming. He sent {{to say as}} 'ow 'e were in the five-acre lot." ...|$|E
60|$|He was a tall, slender {{young man}} with a light brown moustache. Imminent little drops of rain hung at the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat and the collar of his jacket-coat was turned up.|$|E
40|$|Black silk organza bergère-style hat. The hat has {{a floppy}} double-layer brim, the under <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> {{slightly}} stiffer black silk organza, overlaid with upper <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> same material. The low, circular crown is encircled {{at the base}} by a folded black ribbon, which ties at back and has trailing ends. Inside base of crown is band of black grosgrain ribbon. Sewn into ribbon is designer label: "Galanos"...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are good}} to me, George," [...] ses Gerty, {{touching}} the back <b>of</b> <b>’is</b> neck with the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> her hat. [...] "It ain’t often I get {{a ride in}} a cab. All the time I was keeping company with Bob we never ’ad one once. I only wish I’d got {{the money to pay}} for it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Image <b>of</b> the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> {{the vase}} above. The layers of glass {{that form the}} vase can be seen.|$|R
6000|$|... 'For vich reasons,' {{continued}} Sam, plucking nervously at the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat--'for vich reasons, he's drawn it out to-day, {{and come}} here vith me to say, leastvays to offer, {{or in other}} vords--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, child," [...] said Eustace, {{pulling the}} <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cap over his eyes, as if {{preparing}} for a nap. [...] "I can tell you a dozen, as good or better, if I choose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me I am the proper judge, on each side," [...] Mr. Brand declared. He got up, holding the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat against his mouth and staring at Felix through the dusk.|$|E
5000|$|From its Toronto terminal, {{the line}} ran northwards {{on the west}} side of Yonge Street until the {{northern}} <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> Hogg's Hollow. Just south of Saint Clair Avenue, the line passed the line's carhouse {{on the west side}}. At Davisville, the railway had an electrical generation station. At the southern <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> Hogg's Hollow, the line descended a 8% grade. (In 1922, the southern terminal would be at Glen Echo at that southern brim.) ...|$|R
50|$|Hat Island {{is roughly}} four-sided, with an SSE-pointing {{forepeak}} that {{is said to}} look like the upturned <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> a hat.|$|R
60|$|When {{will the}} feet of the Priests be dipped in the still <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> the water? Jordan {{overflows}} his banks already.|$|R
60|$|Stiffening slightly, Mrs. Tucker turned inquiringly to Mr. Patterson. But that gentleman's usual {{profound}} melancholy {{appeared to}} be intensified by the hilarity of his companion. He only sighed deeply and rubbed his leg with the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat in gloomy abstraction.|$|E
60|$|As Buckley swung along {{upon the}} trail {{he felt the}} {{beginning}} of the suffocating constriction about his throat, the cold sweat under the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat, the old, shameful, dreaded sinking of his heart as it went down, down, down in his bosom.|$|E
60|$|My {{first look}} was at Romayne. He {{took off his}} hat, {{and handed it to}} me with a smile. His adversary's bullet had cut a piece out of the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat, on the right side. He had {{literally}} escaped by a hair-breadth.|$|E
6000|$|A strange unaccountable thrill {{ran through}} the boy's frame. He stooped, looked under the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> the hat, and beheld his father! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} it, my lord. Full to the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> themselves, for that reason, the Tapparians are the emptiest of mortals." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him, leaving herself in his hands. He {{went over the}} <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> the declivity and began to climb down.|$|R
6000|$|... 'More like forty,' {{broke in}} an old milkman near, in a long white pinafore or 'wropper,' and with the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat tied down, so that {{he looked like a}} woman. ''A was born before our Great Weir was builded, and I hadn't man's wages when I laved water there.' ...|$|E
60|$|He had {{not gone}} a mile when he saw walking before him a clergyman whose form, after consideration, he recognized, {{in spite of a}} novel {{whiteness}} in that part of his hair that showed below the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat. Swithin walked much faster than this gentleman, and soon was at his side.|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} so entirely unexpected and so thoroughly startling in {{this mode of}} salutation in so peaceful a place, that Ralph leaped two or three feet in his fright, {{and at the same}} time saw the hole in the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hat, which showed how near the deadly missile had come to him.|$|E
60|$|The <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> her linen hat {{kept the}} sun from her face, but {{her head was}} {{drooping}} like a flower's head at noon.|$|R
60|$|The {{words were}} uttered with undisguised ill-feeling; it was plain the pair were not congenial, and further conversation, even {{to one of}} Mr. Finsbury's pathetic loquacity, {{was out of the}} question. With an angry gesture, he pulled down the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> the forage-cap over his eyes, and, {{producing}} a note-book and a blue pencil from one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> innermost pockets, soon became absorbed in calculations.|$|R
60|$|They {{left him}} for perhaps {{a quarter of}} an hour, to pace that long room alone, saved only from impatience by the turmoil <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mind. When at length they returned, they were {{accompanied}} by a tall man in a full-skirted shaggy greatcoat and a broad hat the <b>brim</b> <b>of</b> which was turned down all around. He remained respectfully by the door in the shadows.|$|R
