For observation over the rear slopes of the ridge, [...] were concentrated in II Brigade RFC and eight balloons of II Kite Balloon Wing were placed [...] behind the British front line. The Second Army artillery commander, Major-General George Franks, co-ordinated the corps artillery plans, particularly the heavy artillery arrangements to suppress German artillery, which were devised by the corps and divisional artillery commanders. The Second Army Report Centre at Locre Château was linked by <b>buried</b> <b>cable</b> to each corps report centre, corps heavy artillery headquarters, divisional artillery headquarters, RFC squadrons, balloon headquarters, survey stations and wireless stations. Responsibility for counter-battery fire was given to a counter-battery staff officer with a small staff, who concentrated exclusively on {{the defeat of the}} German artillery. A conference was held each evening by the counter-battery staffs of divisions and corps, methodically to collate the day's reports from observation aircraft and balloons, field survey companies, sound ranging sections and forward observation officers. Each corps had a counter-battery area, which was divided into zones and allotted to heavy artillery groups. Each heavy artillery group headquarters divided their zones into map squares, which were allotted to artillery batteries, required to be ready swiftly to open fire on them.|$|E
50|$|Electrical {{transmission}} and distribution lines for electric power always use voltages significantly higher than 50 volts, so contact with or close approach to the line conductors presents a danger of electrocution. Contact with overhead wires is a frequent cause of injury or death. Metal ladders, farm equipment, boat masts, construction machinery, aerial antennas, and similar objects are frequently involved in fatal contact with overhead wires. Digging into a <b>buried</b> <b>cable</b> can also be dangerous to workers at an excavation site. Digging equipment (either hand tools or machine driven) that contacts a <b>buried</b> <b>cable</b> may energize piping or {{the ground in the}} area, resulting in electrocution of nearby workers. A fault in a high-voltage transmission line or substation may result in high currents flowing along the surface of the earth, producing an earth potential rise that also presents a danger of electric shock.|$|E

50|$|First {{proposed}} in 1914, the grid controlled mercury-arc valve became available for power transmission {{during the period}} 1920 to 1940. Starting in 1932, General Electric tested mercury-vapor valves and a 12 kV DC transmission line, which also served to convert 40 Hz generation to serve 60 Hz loads, at Mechanicville, New York. In 1941, a 60 MW, ±200 kV, 115 km <b>buried</b> <b>cable</b> link was designed {{for the city of}} Berlin using mercury arc valves (Elbe-Project), but owing to the collapse of the German government in 1945 the project was never completed. The nominal justification for the project was that, during wartime, a <b>buried</b> <b>cable</b> would be less conspicuous as a bombing target. The equipment was moved to the Soviet Union and was put into service there as the Moscow-Kashira HVDC system. The Moscow-Kashira system and the 1954 connection by Uno Lamm's group at ASEA between the mainland of Sweden and the island of Gotland {{marked the beginning of the}} modern era of HVDC transmission.|$|E
50|$|Locating faults in a {{cable system}} can be done either with the circuit de-energized, or in some cases, with the circuit under power. Fault {{location}} techniques can be broadly divided into terminal methods, which use voltages and currents measured {{at the ends of}} the cable, and tracer methods, which require inspection {{along the length of the}} cable. Terminal methods can be used to locate the general area of the fault, to expedite tracing on a long or <b>buried</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E

5000|$|OPGW as a {{communication}} medium has some advantages over buried optical fiber cable. Installation cost per kilometre {{is lower than}} a <b>buried</b> <b>cable.</b> Effectively, the optical circuits are protected from accidental contact by the high voltage cables below (and by the elevation of the OPGW from ground). A communications circuit carried by an overhead OPGW cable {{is unlikely to be}} damaged by excavation work, road repairs or installation of buried pipelines. Since the overall dimensions and weight of an OPGW is similar to the regular grounding wire, the towers supporting the line do not experience extra loading due to cable weight, wind and ice loads.|$|E

5000|$|A {{dead-end}} tower (also anchor tower, anchor pylon) is a fully self-supporting structure used in construction of overhead power lines. A dead-end transmission tower uses horizontal strain insulators {{and where the}} conductors mechanically terminate. Dead-end towers may be used at a substation as a transition to a [...] "slack span" [...] entering the equipment, when the circuit changes to a <b>buried</b> <b>cable,</b> when a transmission line changes direction {{by more than a}} few degrees, or just once in a while to limit the extent of a catastrophic collapse.Since {{dead-end tower}}s require more material and are heavier and costlier than suspension towers, it is uneconomic to build a line with only self-supporting structures.|$|E
5000|$|Subtransmission {{is part of}} an {{electric}} power transmission system that runs at relatively lower voltages. It is uneconomical to connect all distribution substations to the high main transmission voltage, because the equipment is larger and more expensive. Typically, only larger substations connect with this high voltage. It is stepped down and sent to smaller substations in towns and neighborhoods. Subtransmission circuits are usually arranged in loops so that a single line failure does not cut off service to a large number of customers for more than a short time. Loops can be [...] "normally closed", where loss of one circuit should result in no interruption, or [...] "normally open" [...] where substations can switch to a backup supply. While subtransmission circuits are usually carried on overhead lines, in urban areas <b>buried</b> <b>cable</b> may be used. The lower-voltage subtransmission lines use less right-of-way and simpler structures; it is much more feasible to put them underground where needed. Higher-voltage lines require more space and are usually above-ground since putting them underground is very expensive.|$|E

40|$|This study reports an {{adaptation}} of a parametric echosounder system using 15 kHz as secondary frequency to investigate the angular response of sub-bottom backscatter strength of layered mud, providing a new method for enhanced acoustic detection of buried targets. Adaptions to achieve both vertical (0 °) and non-vertical inclination (1 – 15 °, 30 °, 45 ° and 60 °) comprise mechanical tilting of the acoustic transducer and electronic beam steering. Data were acquired at 18 m water depth at a study site characterized by a flat, muddy seafloor where a 0. 1 m diameter power cable lies 1 – 2 m below the seafloor. Surveying the cable with vertical incidence revealed that the <b>buried</b> <b>cable</b> can hardly be discriminated against the backscatter strength of the layered mud. However, the backscatter strength of layered mud decreases strongly at > 3 ± 0. 5 ° incidence and the layered mud echo pattern vanishes beyond 5 °. As a consequence, the backscatter pattern of the <b>buried</b> <b>cable</b> is very pronounced in acoustic images gathered at 15 °, 30 °, 45 ° and 60 ° incidence. The size of the cable echo pattern increases linearly with incidence. These effects are attributed to reflection loss from layered mud at larger incidence and to the scattering of the 0. 1 m diameter <b>buried</b> <b>cable.</b> Data analyses support the visual impression of superior detection of the cable with an up to 2. 6 -fold increase of the signal-to-noise ratio at 40 ° incidence compared to the vertical incidence case...|$|E
