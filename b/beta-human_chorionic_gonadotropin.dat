50|$|Characteristic {{feature is}} the {{identification}} of intimately related syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts without formation of definite placental type villi. Since choriocarcinomas include syncytiotrophoblasts (beta-HCG producing cells), they cause elevated blood levels of <b>beta-human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin.</b>|$|E
50|$|These cysts {{result from}} exaggerated {{physiological}} stimulation (hyperreactio luteinalis) {{and are usually}} associated with markedly elevated levels of <b>beta-human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> (beta-hCG). They are thus associated with gestational trophoblastic disease (molar pregnancy), diabetes mellitus, alloimmunisation to Rh-D, and multiple gestations. They have rarely been associated with chronic kidney disease (secondary to reduced hCG clearance) and hyperthyroidism (given the structural homology with TSH). These cysts resolve after pregnancy. Rarely, when the theca-lutein cysts are stimulated by gonadotropins, massive ascites can result. In most cases however, abdominal symptoms are minimal and restricted to peritoneal irritation from cyst hemorrhage. Surgical intervention {{may be required to}} remove ruptured or infarcted tissue.|$|E

Little is known about human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> β expression in renal cancer. We determined the pretreatment levels of human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> β in serum of patients with renal cell carcinoma, and studied whether elevated levels predicted the clinical outcome. Serum samples were collected before surgery from 177 patients with renal cell carcinoma and from 84 apparently healthy controls. Human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> β in serum was measured by a highly sensitive time-resolved immunofluorometric assay. The prognostic value of human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> β, and of usual clinical and pathological variables was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, the log rank test and Cox multiple hazard regression. The serum concentrations of human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> β were increased in 23 % of the renal cell carcinoma patients and they were significantly higher in patients with renal cell carcinoma than in controls (P< 0. 0001). The concentrations did not correlate with clinical stage and histopathological grade, but patients with increased human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> β levels had significantly shorter survival time than those with levels below the median (cut-off 1. 2 [*]pmol[*]l− 1, P= 0. 0029). In multivariate analysis human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> β, tumour stage and grade were independent prognostic variables.

Only a few case reports have described lung cancers that secrete <b>beta-human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin.</b> Case presentation A 68 -year-old Caucasian man presented with symptoms of weakness, fatigue and weight loss for the past two months. On examination, he was found to have generalized lymphadenopathy, and radiologic workup revealed numerous metastases in the lungs, liver and kidneys. Biopsy of the supraclavicular lymph node revealed metastatic large cell lung cancer with <b>beta-human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> hormone positivity. The serum <b>beta-human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> level was 11, 286 mIU/ml (upper limit of normal, 0. 5 mIU/ml in non-pregnant females). He was diagnosed with stage 4 lung non-small cell lung cancer. The patient refused chemotherapy. He was discharged home with hospice care. Conclusion The markedly elevated serum values of <b>beta-human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> initially prompted the medical team to investigate germinal tumors. In the presence of a negative testicular ultrasound, workup was performed to find an extratesticular source of the tumor. Finally, the diagnosis was made with a tissue biopsy.

40|$|Abstract. The {{regulation}} of secretion of <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> in primates {{has been studied}} using both in vivo and in vitro models. In vivo studies using the pregnant bonnet monkey revealed that at the doses tested, the administration of progesterone or estradiol 17 β in combination or alone {{did not result in}} any appreciable change in the duration or magnitude of serum <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> levels. However, administration of lutropin-releasing hormone by intravenous route resulted in significant increase in <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> levels within 30 – 60 min and the extent of stimulation seemed to depend on the state of pregnancy. For in vitro studies, explants or cells prepared from first trimester human placenta has been used. The functional integrity of these cells has been established by demonstrating the binding of [125 I]-labelled human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> antibody to the cells as well as the synthesis of [3 H]-labelled human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin.</b> In vitro studies using the cells revealed that addition of lutropin-releasing hormone caused a significant increase in <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> and estradiol 17 β secreted into the medium. Thus both in vivo and in vitro results suggest that lutropin-releasing hormone {{could be one of the}} factors involved in {{regulation of}} <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> secretion in primates...|$|R
40|$|Human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin,</b> estradiol, progesterone, and 17 -hydroxyprogesterone {{have been}} {{measured}} in the serum of 46 patients with ectopic pregnancy. All these hormones were significantly lower than in normal pregnancy. Unruptured ectopic pregnancy differed from the ruptured state by a lower serum human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> concentration, a slower human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> increment, {{a higher incidence of}} metrorrhagia, and an earlier diagnosis. The concentration of estradiol, progesterone, and 17 -hydroxyprogesterone in the serum of patients with ectopic pregnancy was lower than could be expected from the decrease of human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin,</b> often lower than in a normal luteal phase. It is suggested that, as long as ultrasonography fails to show an intrauterine pregnancy, the simultaneous determination of serum human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> and progesterone could aid in the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy and in the improvement of subsequent fertility; to that regard any progesterone level below 15 ng/ml in the presence of detectable amounts of human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> is highly suggestive of either a threatened abortion or an ectopic pregnancy, whatever the gestational age. © 1987.

40|$|Summary: A new commercially {{available}} Chemiluminescence immunoassay for the quantitative measurement of human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> and its-subunit in serum was {{compared with the}} enzyme immunoassay used in our routine laboratory. Human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> was determined in serum from pregnant women, {{as well as from}} women with abortus inaminens, suspected ectopic pregnancies or with molar pregnancies. The new human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> assay was also evaluated in combination with an automatic sample processor for distributing samples to the antibody-coated wells of the microtitre plates. The analytical precision, specificity and accuracy of the human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> assay were assessed with 152 sera, using the 60 min^incubation as well as the shorter 15 min version. Specificity was comparable with the conventional system, whereas the Chemiluminescence assay performed better with respect to the assay detection limit and measuring range. The enhanced Chemiluminescence system for the determination of human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> is an efficient assay which agrees well with our routine assay. In connection with an automatic sample processor it enables an advanced and versatile system for the determination of human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> in labo-ratories with large series.

Previous studies have highlighted their potential as prognostic, predictive, and pharmacological tools in the treatment of cancer. Disseminated testicular germ cell cancer (TC) is a paradigm for a chemosensitive solid malignancy of epithelial origin and has a cure rate of 80 % to 90 %. We conducted M 30 /M 65 analyses on 34 patients with TC before and during treatment with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin and showed that prechemotherapy serum levels of M 65 and M 30 antigens are correlated with established TC tumor markers lactate dehydrogenase, alpha-fetoprotein, and <b>beta-human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin,</b> probably reflecting tumor load. Cumulative percentage change of M 65 and M 30 from baseline to end of study was highest in poor prognosis patients (P <. 05).
