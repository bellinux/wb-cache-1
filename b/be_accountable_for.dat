5|$|The {{domestic}} cat is {{a significant}} predator of birds. UK assessments indicate they may <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> an estimated 64.8million bird deaths each year. A 2012 study suggests feral cats may kill several billion birds {{each year in the}} United States. Certain species appear more susceptible than others; for example, 30% of house sparrow mortality is linked to the domestic cat. In the recovery of ringed robins (Erithacus rubecula) and dunnocks (Prunella modularis), 31% of deaths were a result of cat predation. In parts of North America, the presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes which prey on cats and other small predators reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety. The proposal that cat populations will increase when the numbers of these top predators decline is called the mesopredator release hypothesis.|$|E

Research findings show that although bilingual benefits are muted in middle adulthood, they are more profound in older age when those who develop dementia experience onset about 4.5 years later in bilingual subjects. The increased attentional control, inhibition, and conflict resolution developed from bilingualism may <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> the later onset of dementia.|$|E

The story is suggested for use in curriculum to teach children about food, in books Humanics National Preschool Assessment Handbook, and The Complete Daily Curriculum for Early Childhood. Mildred R. Donoghue writes in Language Arts: Integrating Skills for Classroom Teaching that the story should be utilised {{in the course of}} primary education. In their work Success in Reading and Writing, authors Barbara J. Blackford, Helen Cappleman and Betty Cramer suggest the book be read aloud to children in kindergarten, and the teacher should subsequently quiz members of the class {{to see if they can}} recall items from the boy's shopping list. Authors Diane Stirling, Linda McKay, Georgia Archibald and Shelley Berg recommend the story in their book Character Education Connections: For School, Home and Community, in order to teach children the character trait of responsibility: [...] "A willingness to <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> your own actions without blaming others." ...|$|E

A 1998 report in New African praised the PTF under Buhari for its transparency, calling it a rare [...] "success story". However, the same report also noted that critics had questioned the PTF's allocation of 20% of its resources to the military, which the critics feared would not <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> the revenue.|$|E
2500|$|The {{resultant}} embarrassing {{bad publicity}} from the opium war brought on a Thai crackdown {{on all the}} Kuomintang remaining on their northern border. Prior to the 1967 Opium War, the Thais and KMT had preserved a fiction that the Chinese were civilian refugees seeking asylum. After the Chinese exposure caused by the battle at Ban Khwan, the Royal Thai Army began strictly supervising the Kuomintang units, insisting that their commanders <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> their troops. Eventually, the Thais would quietly legitimize the KMT as paramilitary units. [...] The KMT's revenue from the opium trade was much diminished; their 15-year control of the smuggling routes, collecting their [...] "transit tax", had ended with the fighting at Ban Khwan.|$|E

2500|$|Long a level-headed {{character}} who sacrifices her own desires {{for those of}} her friends, she gradually abandons these priorities to be more independent and please herself. She is often shown making choices that allow her to acquire power or knowledge and avoid emotional conflict. The story arc of Willow's growing dependence on magic was noted by Marti Noxon as the representation of [...] "adult crossroads" [...] and Willow's inability and unwillingness to <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> her own life. Willow enjoys power she is unable to control. She steals to accomplish her vocational goals and rationalizes her amoral behavior. This also manifests itself in a competitive streak and she accuses others who share their concerns that she uses magic for selfish purposes of being jealous. No longer {{the conscience of the}} Scooby Gang, Willow cedes this role to Tara then revels in breaking more rules. After Tara leaves Willow, Willow divulges to Buffy that she does not know who she is and doubts her worth and appeal—specifically to Tara—without magic. Contradicting the characterization of Willow's issues with magic as addiction, Buffy essayist Jacqueline Lichtenberg writes [...] "Willow is not addicted to magic. Willow is addicted to the surging hope that this deed or the next or the next will finally assuage her inner pain." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among {{those who}} earned their {{living in the}} streets of London, the more criticized were the hackney coach drivers. Moreton defines them [...] "the scum of the people, and, {{generally}} speaking, the worst of rogues", robbing their customers on a regular basis, and often in league with highway robbers. Hackney coach travellers were generally at the mercy of their carriers, and even the simplest travel could easily turn into a real danger. Even the most [...] "honest" [...] among them were used to rework the city routes and rates as they pleased in order to increase their profits. Hackney coach drivers were so severely criticized for being rude and abusive, that in 1682 the Common Council had to pass an act for their regulation aiming: to limit their number, to establish a valid licence and a fair charge, and to set out places where they could wait for hire. Moreton brings the attention of the reader on a technicality that might explain why these drivers most of the time managed to walk unpunished. As a matter of fact, the renter of the coach rarely appears to be the actual driver (although they might be in league), therefore [...] "the penalty, which used to be on the renter, being now on the driver, the renter or owner of that figure is clear, and the driver has nothing to do but to be absent and laugh at the complainant". For this reason, the law needs to be amended so that both the driver and the renter (for Moreton equally guilty) might <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> extortion, insolence, or offences. In addition, the renter should be obliged to register and respond for the behaviour of the driver he rented his coach to.|$|E

60|$|It is {{not merely}} so in this or that government, but in all countries. The king {{in this country is}} {{undoubtedly}} unaccountable for his actions. The House of Lords, if it should ever exercise, (God forbid I should suspect it would ever do what it has never done!)--but if it should ever abuse its judicial power, and give such a judgment as it ought not to give, whether from fear of popular clamor on the one hand, or predilection to the prisoner on the other,--if they abuse their judgments, there is no calling them to an account for it. And so, if the Commons should abuse their power, nay, if they should have been so greatly delinquent as not to have prosecuted this offender, they could not <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> it; there is no punishing them for their acts, because we exercise a part of the supreme power. But are they less criminal, less rebellious against the Divine Majesty? are they less hateful to man, whose opinions they ought to cultivate as far as they are just? No: till society fall into a state of dissolution, they cannot <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> their acts. But it is from confounding the unaccountable character inherent in the supreme power with arbitrary power, that all this confusion of ideas has arisen.|$|E
