50|$|Tasmania has {{the largest}} {{exposure}} of dolerite {{in the world of}} 30000 km2 and a volume of 15000 km3. In Tasmania the rock is characteristic of many mountains with its columnar joining and dark blue grey colour. The composition is 40% plagioclase, 20% clinopyroxene, 20% quartz, 5% ilmenite and small percentages of potassium feldspar and amphibole. The rock is altered by water to smectite and kaolinite with quartz being left unaltered. The soil surface concentrates zirconium and titanium. The soils on dolerite also contain nodules of hematite and may contain a <b>buried</b> <b>layer</b> of stones called a stone line.|$|E

50|$|The {{great power}} of XANES derives from its {{elemental}} specificity. Because the various elements have different core level energies, NEXAFS permits extraction {{of the signal}} from a surface monolayer or even a single <b>buried</b> <b>layer</b> {{in the presence of}} a huge background signal. Buried layers are very important in engineering applications, such as magnetic recording media buried beneath a surface lubricant or dopants below an electrode in an integrated circuit. Because XANES can also determine the chemical state of elements which are present in bulk in minute quantities, it has found widespread use in environmental chemistry and geochemistry. The ability of XANES to study buried atoms is due to its integration over all final states including inelastically scattered electrons, as opposed to photoemission and Auger spectroscopy, which study atoms only with a layer or two of the surface.|$|E

50|$|A high {{temperature}} Scanning SQUID Microscope using a YBCO SQUID {{is capable of}} measuring magnetic fields as small as 20 pT (about 2 million times weaker than the earth’s magnetic field). The SQUID sensor is sensitive enough that it can detect a wire {{even if it is}} carrying only 10 nA of current at a distance of 100 µm from the SQUID sensor with 1 second averaging. The microscope uses a patented design to allow the sample under investigation to be at room temperature and in air while the SQUID sensor is under vacuum and cooled to less than 80 K using a cryo cooler. No Liquid Nitrogen is used. During non-contact, non-destructive imaging of room temperature samples in air, the system achieves a raw, unprocessed spatial resolution equal to the distance separating the sensor from the current or the effective size of the sensor, whichever is larger. To best locate a wire short in a <b>buried</b> <b>layer,</b> however, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) back-evolution technique can be used to transform the magnetic field image into an equivalent map of the current in an integrated circuit or printed wiring board. The resulting current map can then be compared to a circuit diagram to determine the fault location. With this post-processing of a magnetic image and the low noise present in SQUID images, it is possible to enhance the spatial resolution by factors of 5 or more over the near-field limited magnetic image. The system’s output is displayed as a false-color image of magnetic field strength or current magnitude (after processing) versus position on the sample. After processing to obtain current magnitude, this microscope has been successful at locating shorts in conductors to within ±16 µm at a sensor-current distance of 150 µm.|$|E

A backside implant before init ial oxidation of the wafers wil l minimize the density of epitaxial defects for both arsenic diffused or im-planted <b>buried</b> <b>layers.</b> For dittused <b>buried</b> <b>layers,</b> the backside damage offers only min imum improvement in yield because of the gettering action of the diffused arsenic itself.

40|$|Damage in ESD {{protection}} devices {{can be caused}} by high local temperatures resulting from heat generation by an ESD pulse. In order to obtain physical insight into the process that leads to permanent damage, device simulations of coupled thermal and electrical behaviour have been performed. Additional to the potential and the electron and hole concentrations the lattice temperature is solved as a variable. Simulations of ESD pulses (forward bias) applied to a diode have been performed. The discharge mechanism could be visualised by using the coupled thermal/electrical model. Locations with considerable temperature rise that eventually lead to damage can be extracted from the calculated temperature distributions. Protection devices with optimum electrical and thermal characteristics can be designed by adjusting doping profiles and layout parameters. The <b>buried</b> <b>layer</b> of the protection device does not contribute in conducting current at high current levels.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{theoretical}} and experimental concentration and temperature dependent band gap narrowing in uncompensated n-type silicon is studied. Electron-electron and electron-impurity interaction energies {{are used to}} calculate the theoretical band gap narrowing in the plasmon-pole approximation. These reveal an increase of 14 meV in the band gap narrowing at 300 K for a donor concentration of 3. 10 (^ 19) cm(^- 3) above the zero temperature value of 95 meV. For higher concentrations the degeneracy deepens and the zero and finite temperature band gap narrowing curves converge. Localized states in the band gap resulting from local fluctuations in the electron-impurity interaction, a result of the random position of the impurities, are also considered. When the analysis includes the effect on the host band of the electron-impurity interactions calculated above the resulting density of states in the band tail of uncompensated silicon is found to be ten times smaller than is usually imagined. Using published values for the minority carrier mobility both the band gap narrowing and the minority carrier lifetime are experimentally determined in the buried n-type layer of an Integrated Injection Logic transistor.
