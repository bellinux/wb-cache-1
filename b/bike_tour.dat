25|$|In Kaunas, Poška {{lived in}} a {{dormitory}} maintained by Žiburėlis society and worked odd jobs, including construction, while attending an evening school.

In 1923, he attended the World Esperanto Congress in Nuremberg, Germany, {{and a year later}} received an Esperanto teacher certificate from the Lithuanian Ministry of Education. In 1926, when the first Lithuanian radio station opened in Kaunas, Poška hosted a regular Esperanto-language program Nia anguleto. In 1926–29, Poška studied medicine at Kaunas University. Poška started traveling in Lithuania and abroad rather early. In July 1925, he completed his first <b>bike</b> <b>tour</b> across Lithuania with three friends.

25|$|Following his loss, Bauman {{announced}} that he was finished with politics and began organizing bicycle tours. In 1994, he organized Cycle Vietnam, the first large-scale American bicycle tour of that country. In 1996, Bauman created Portland Bridge Pedal, a bicycle tour with a route over all 10 Portland bridges that cross the Willamette River. Bauman said he was inspired to organize such an event after he had a view of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens from the Marquam Bridge in his car and thought bicyclists should have a chance to enjoy the views normally available only to drivers. The first event drew 7,500 riders; Providence Health & Services began sponsoring the event a year later and renamed it the Providence Bridge Pedal. By 2007, the tour was the third-largest of the largest organized cycle tours in the world, behind New York City's Five Boro <b>Bike</b> <b>Tour</b> and Montreal's Tour de l'Île. Bauman is still involved with the event.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the bridge}} was not built with a {{pedestrian}} walkway, non-motorized transportation is limited to using the bridge during special {{events such as the}} New York City Marathon and Five Boro <b>Bike</b> <b>Tour.</b> In 1993 the New York City Department of City Planning called for a footpath across the bridge as part of their Greenway Plan for New York City. In 1997 the DCP released a feasibility study stating that two footpaths running between the suspender ropes along the upper level, separated for pedestrian and cyclist use, would cost a minimum of $26.5 million. [...] The MTA at the time expressed concern about the [...] "safety and liability inherent in any strategy that introduces pedestrian and bicycle access" [...] to the bridge. Recently, residents living on both ends of the bridge have lobbied for pedestrian access. In October 2003, Mayor Michael Bloomberg promised to look into establishing the long-awaited pedestrian and bicycle access. [...] The Harbor Ring Committee was formed in 2011 to advocate for the completion of the Harbor Ring route – a 50-mile path around New York Harbor, including a footpath across the Verrazzano. [...] In spring 2013 they began an on-line petition that generated more than 2,500 signatures, as well as an organizational sign-on letter with the support of 16 regional and local advocacy and planning organizations. [...] On October 2, 2013 the MTA announced as part of its 2015–2034 Capital Needs Assessment that it would include a feasibility study for installing a pathway on the Verrazzano.|$|E
