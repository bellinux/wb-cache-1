5|$|Géza was {{the eldest}} son of the future King Béla I of Hungary and his wife Richeza or Adelhaid, a {{daughter}} of King Mieszko II of Poland. The Illuminated Chronicle narrates that Géza and his brother Ladislaus were born in Poland, where their father who had been banished from Hungary settled in the 1030s. Géza was born in about 1040. According to the historians Gyula Kristó and Ferenc Makk, he was named after his grandfather's uncle Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians. His <b>baptismal</b> <b>name</b> was Magnus.|$|E
5|$|In 1385, the Union of Krewo {{was signed}} between Queen Jadwiga of Poland and Jogaila, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, {{the ruler of}} the last pagan state in Europe. The act {{arranged}} for Jogaila's baptism and the couple's marriage, which established {{the beginning of the}} Polish-Lithuanian union. After Jogaila's baptism, he was known in Poland by his <b>baptismal</b> <b>name</b> Władysław and the Polish version of his Lithuanian name, Jagiełło. The union strengthened both nations in their shared opposition to the Teutonic Knights and the growing threat of the Grand Duchy of Moscow.|$|E
5000|$|Given {{names in}} Slovakia are called <b>baptismal</b> <b>names</b> (krstné mená) even though {{today they are}} {{completely}} separate from the Christian <b>baptismal</b> <b>names.</b> Proper <b>baptismal</b> <b>names</b> given during infant baptism are still common in the countryside, yet they are only seldom used within the official name (if they are, they form the person's middle name).

5|$|On 24 May 1671, {{the first}} anniversary of his {{grandfather}} Ferdinando II's death, Giovanni Battista Gastone de' Medici was born in Florence to Grand Duke Cosimo III and Marguerite Louise d'Orléans. He derived his <b>baptismal</b> <b>name,</b> Giovanni Battista Gastone, from his maternal grandfather, Gaston, Duke of Orléans. Cosimo and Marguerite Louise frequently quarreled. As a result, four years after his birth, Marguerite Louise returned home to France. Gian Gastone and his siblings were left in the care of their grandmother Vittoria della Rovere.|$|E
5|$|Sabrina {{was born}} in 1757 in Clerkenwell, London, and was left at the Hospital for the Maintenance and Education of Exposed and Deserted Young Children (more {{commonly}} known as the Foundling Hospital) in London on 24 May 1757 by an anonymous individual. This person left a note explaining that the baby's <b>baptismal</b> <b>name</b> was Manima Butler and that she had been baptised in St James's Church, Clerkenwell. Her name was likely a misspelling of Monimia but there were no baptismal records for any spelling of the name at the parish.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year Soegija asked {{to join the}} Catholic-education classes, citing a desire to fully use the facilities at Xaverius. His teacher, Father Mertens, told Soegija that he required permission from his parents first; although they refused, Soegija was nevertheless allowed to study Catholicism. He was intrigued by the Trinity, and asked several of the priests for clarification. Van Lith cited the works of Thomas Aquinas, while Mertens discussed the Trinity as explained by Augustine of Hippo; the latter told him that humans were not meant to understand God with their limited knowledge. Soegija, who wanted to learn more, asked to be baptised, quoting the Finding in the Temple to show why he should not need his parents' permission. The priests agreed, and Soegija was baptised on 24December 1910, taking the <b>baptismal</b> <b>name</b> Albertus, for Albertus Magnus. During Christmas holidays, he told his family that he had converted. Although his immediate family eventually accepted this, and may have eventually supported him, Soegija's other relatives refused {{to speak to him}} afterwards.|$|E

25|$|In late 878, Guthrum's band withdrew to Cirencester, in {{the kingdom}} of Mercia. Then, {{probably}} in late 879, it moved to East Anglia, where Guthrum, who was also known by his <b>baptismal</b> <b>name</b> of Aethelstan, reigned as king until his death in 890.|$|E
25|$|The 10th-century Norman {{historian}} Dudo {{records that}} Rollo took the <b>baptismal</b> <b>name</b> Robert. A variant spelling, Roul, {{is used in}} the 12th-century Norman French Roman de la Rou, which was compiled by Wace and commissioned by King Henry II of England (a descendant of Rollo).|$|E

50|$|During {{the first}} centuries of the church, priests elected bishop of Rome {{continued}} to use their <b>baptismal</b> <b>names</b> after their elections. The custom of choosing a new name began in AD 533 {{with the election of}} Mercurius. Mercurius had been named after the Roman god Mercury, and decided {{that it would not be}} appropriate for a pope to be named after a Roman god. Mercurius subsequently decreed that he would be known as John II. Since the end of the tenth century the pope has customarily chosen a new name for himself during his Pontificate; however, until the 16th century some pontiffs used their <b>baptismal</b> <b>names.</b>|$|R
50|$|Both Kenneth and Fraser {{are common}} <b>baptismal</b> <b>names</b> amongst the Morus even today, {{reflecting}} the high esteem {{he is still}} held in amongst these people. When Morus visit Britain they are keen to visit Edinburgh where Dr Fraser trained.|$|R
25|$|When baptised, a {{child can}} get an {{additional}} name (<b>baptismal</b> <b>name),</b> especially {{if there is no}} saint who bears their name, so they take a name associated with a patron saint. In confirmation, children receive another given name, but it is not used. Both baptismal and confirmation names have religious significance only, and they are not on any official records.|$|E
25|$|According to Dudo, Rollo {{struck up}} a {{friendship}} in England with a king that Dudo calls Alstem. This has puzzled many historians, but recently the puzzle has been resolved by recognition that this refers to Guthrum, the Danish leader whom Alfred the Great baptised with the <b>baptismal</b> <b>name</b> Athelstan, and then recognised as king of the East Angles in 880.|$|E
25|$|Between the {{restoration}} of London and the resumption of large-scale Danish attacks in the early 890s, Alfred's reign was rather uneventful. The relative peace of the late 880s was marred {{by the death of}} Alfred's sister, Æthelswith, en route to Rome in 888. In the same year the Archbishop of Canterbury, Æthelred, also died. One year later Guthrum, or Athelstan by his <b>baptismal</b> <b>name,</b> Alfred's former enemy and king of East Anglia, died and was buried in Hadleigh, Suffolk.|$|E

25|$|In Cappadocia, in {{the time}} of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (913–959), the shepherds of the Nativity story are called SATOR, AREPON, and TENETON, while a Byzantine bible of an earlier period conjures out of the square the <b>baptismal</b> <b>names</b> of the three Magi, ATOR, SATOR, and PERATORAS.|$|R
50|$|In {{some sources}} his <b>baptismal</b> <b>names</b> are given as Jacques, Joseph (most {{probably}} in error); his surname also spelled as (de) Fermon or (de) Fermond. He {{can also be}} referred to as comte Defermon, comte de l'Empire (count Defermon, count of the Empire) from 23 March 1808.|$|R
25|$|After her First Communion {{at the age}} of nine, she practised {{in secret}} severe {{corporal}} mortification, until rheumatic fever confined her to bed for four years. At the end of this period, having made a vow to the Blessed Virgin to consecrate herself to religious life, she was instantly restored to perfect health. In recognition of this favor, she added the name Mary to her <b>baptismal</b> <b>name</b> of Margaret. According to her later account of her life, she had visions of Jesus Christ, which she thought were a normal part of human experience and continued to practice austerity.|$|E
25|$|Although {{her father}} was a non-denominational Protestant and her mother Episcopalian, Surratt was {{enrolled}} in a private Roman Catholic girls' boarding school, the Academy for Young Ladies in Alexandria, Virginia, on November 25, 1835. Mary's maternal aunt, Sarah Latham Webster, was a Catholic, which may have influenced where she was sent to school. Within two years, Mary converted to Roman Catholicism and adopted the <b>baptismal</b> <b>name</b> of Maria Eugenia. She stayed at the Academy for Young Ladies for four years, leaving in 1839, when the school closed. She remained an observant Catholic {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
25|$|James {{was born}} in Laugharne, Carmarthenshire, Wales, the son of Gelly John, a shoemaker. He {{recorded}} that he received instruction from a local clergyman, eventually mastering the classics, and acquiring proficiency in French, Italian, Spanish, Arabic and Persian. As James John, his <b>baptismal</b> <b>name,</b> he became involved in radical politics. Under the name of Julian Augustus St John he went to London, where he obtained the post of deputy editor of Richard Carlile's radical newspaper The Republican. In 1819, shortly after the Peterloo Massacre, Carlile was imprisoned and St. John briefly took over his role as editor.|$|E

5000|$|Ezana {{is unknown}} in the King Lists even though the coins bear this name. According to tradition, Emperors Abreha and Asbeha ruled Ethiopia when Christianity was introduced. It may be that these names were later applied to 'Ezana and his brother or that these were their <b>baptismal</b> <b>names.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{stock of}} Welsh {{surnames}} is very small, which is partly {{attributable to the}} reduction in the variety of <b>baptismal</b> <b>names</b> after the Protestant Reformation. The typically Welsh surnames Evans, Jones, Williams, Davies and Thomas were all found in the top ten surnames recorded in England and Wales in 2000.|$|R
25|$|According to a custom, {{it would}} be a disgrace if a younger sister would marry before the elder sister. Therefore, Sophia's older sister Vasilisa was married off to Ivan Bielski, son of Jogaila's {{half-brother}} Vladimir Olgerdovich, in 1421. In February 1422, Sophia was baptized in the Roman Catholic rite (Sophia is her Catholic <b>baptismal</b> <b>name).</b> The wedding ceremony, carried out by Matthias of Trakai, Bishop of Samogitia, took place in Navahrudak on February 7 or 24. However, her coronation as Queen of Poland took place two years later, on March 5, 1424. This delay is explained by resistance from the Polish nobility and rather distant relationship between Sophia and Jogaila.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{owner of}} the island of Alcatraz is Julian Workman, to whom it was given by Mexican governor Pio Pico in June 1846, {{with the understanding that}} Workman would build a lighthouse on it. Julian Workman is the <b>baptismal</b> <b>name</b> of William Workman, co-owner of Rancho La Puente and personal friend of Pio Pico. Later in 1846, acting in his capacity as Military Governor of California, John C. Frémont, champion of Manifest Destiny and leader of the Bear Flag Republic, bought the island for $5,000 {{in the name of the}} United States government from Francis Temple. In 1850, President Millard Fillmore ordered that Alcatraz Island be set aside specifically as a United States military reservation, for military purposes based upon the U.S. acquisition of California from Mexico following the Mexican–American War. Frémont had expected a large compensation for his initiative in purchasing and securing Alcatraz Island for the U.S. government, but the U.S. government later invalidated the sale and paid Frémont nothing. Frémont and his heirs sued for compensation during protracted but unsuccessful legal battles that extended into the 1890s.|$|E
25|$|The King's full <b>baptismal</b> <b>name</b> was Siaosi Tāufaʻāhau Tupoulahi, but he {{was soon}} better known by the {{traditional}} title reserved for Crown Princes: Tupoutoʻa, (bestowed in 1937) later replaced by the title he inherited from his father: Tungī (or using both: Tupoutoʻa-Tungī, in that time written as Tuboutoʻa-Tugi). He kept the Tungī title until his death. From a traditional point of view {{he was not only}} the Tungī, which is the direct descendent from the Tuʻi Haʻatakalaua, {{but he was}} also, on becoming king, the 22nd Tuʻi Kanokupolu. The link with the Tuʻi Tonga, was more indirect. He was not a Tuʻi Tonga too (as that office has gone over into the Kalaniuvalu line), but his grandmother Lavinia Veiongo (wife of George Tupou II) was the great-granddaughter of Laufilitonga, the last Tuʻi Tonga, and his wife Halaevalu Mataʻaho (not {{to be confused with the}} King's wife of the same name and same family), who was the daughter of Tupou ʻAhomeʻe, who was the daughter of Lātūfuipeka, the Tamahā (sister of the Tuʻi Tonga). By consequence, the King's daughter, Pilolevu, was the first woman in Tongan culture to really have the blood of the three major Royal dynasties in her veins and become the highest-ranking person ever.|$|E
5000|$|Archduchess Assunta of Austria {{was born}} on 10 August 1902 in Vienna, Austria.

She was given the <b>baptismal</b> <b>names</b> Assunta Alice Ferdinandine Blanca Leopoldina Margarethe Beatrix Raphaela Michaela Philomena.|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the many}} criticisms of Brown's writing {{is that he}} uses the name da Vinci (meaning [...] "from Vinci") in the manner that {{surnames}} are commonly used nowadays. Leonardo {{would never have been}} referred to simply as da Vinci in his lifetime. Such designations were appended to common <b>baptismal</b> <b>names</b> in order to identify individuals.|$|R
