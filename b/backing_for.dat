He instead sought out an existing script on which to base his next film, settling on what would become 1980's The Elephant Man.|$|E
5|$|The coins met {{a hostile}} {{reception}} {{from the business}} community in Honolulu, who feared inflation of the currency {{in a time of}} recession. After legal maneuvering, the government agreed to use over half of the coinage as <b>backing</b> <b>for</b> paper currency, and this continued until better economic times began in 1885. After that, the coins were more eagerly accepted in circulation. They remained in the flow of commerce on the islands until withdrawn in 1903, after Hawaii had become a US territory.|$|E

5|$|Further {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Powell with Brown and Roach {{took place in}} New York during January and February 1955. The tracks cut in January, with arrangements by Neal Hefti, were released as Clifford Brown with Strings. The February sessions yielded the albums Study in Brown, and, combined with tracks from the previous year, Clifford Brown & Max Roach. The latter {{was added to the}} Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. At the Newport Jazz Festival in July 1955 Powell played with Roach and others as <b>backing</b> <b>for</b> Washington.

5|$|Hard rock {{is a form}} of loud, {{aggressive}} rock music. The {{electric guitar}} is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a <b>backing</b> <b>for</b> the rhythm and lead guitars. Vocals are often growling, raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even falsetto voice.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, {{media reports}} linked Brown {{with the role}} as the next {{managing}} director of the International Monetary Fund following the scheduled retirement of Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Brown's successor and Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband, supported Brown for the role while the Prime Minister, David Cameron, voiced opposition to this. Following the arrest of Strauss-Kahn for alleged sexual assault in May 2011, and his subsequent resignation, these reports re-surfaced. Support for Brown among economists was mixed but British Government <b>backing</b> <b>for</b> his candidature was not forthcoming and instead supported Christine Lagarde – the eventual successful candidate – for the post.|$|E

5|$|Newman {{needed to}} find {{financial}} <b>backing</b> <b>for</b> his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from {{his experience as a}} singing teacher, agreed. As members of Wood's brass and woodwind sections were unwilling to buy new low-pitched instruments, Cathcart imported a set from Belgium and lent them to the players. After a season, the players recognised that the low pitch would be permanently adopted, and they bought the instruments from him.|$|E

5|$|Of 234 {{representatives in}} the House, Breckinridge was one of 80 re-elected to the Thirty-third Congress. His {{relative}} seniority, and Pierce's election, increased his influence. He was rumored to have Pierce's <b>backing</b> <b>for</b> Speaker of the House, but he again deferred to Boyd; Maryland's Augustus R. Sollers spoiled Boyd's unanimous election by voting for Breckinridge. Still not given a committee chairmanship, {{he was assigned to}} the Ways and Means Committee, where he secured passage of a bill to cover overspending in fiscal year 1853–1854; {{it was the only time}} in his career that he solely managed a bill.

5|$|Proposals to {{establish}} a joint British airline, combining {{the assets of the}} British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA) were first raised in 1953 as a result of difficulties in attempts by BOAC and BEA to negotiate air rights through the British colony of Cyprus. Increasingly BOAC was protesting that BEA was using its subsidiary Cyprus Airways to circumvent an agreement that BEA would not fly routes further east than Cyprus, particularly to the increasingly important oil regions in the Middle East. The Chairman of BOAC, Miles Thomas, was in favour of merger as a potential solution to this disagreement and had <b>backing</b> <b>for</b> the idea from the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, Rab Butler. However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the proposal.|$|E
5|$|The Bland–Allison Act, {{passed by}} Congress on February 28, 1878, {{required}} the Treasury {{to purchase a}} minimum of $2million in domestically mined silver per month and coin it into silver dollars. The Mint used a new design by engraver George T. Morgan, and struck {{what became known as}} the Morgan dollar. Many of the pieces quickly vanished into bank vaults for use as <b>backing</b> <b>for</b> paper currency redeemable in silver coin, known as silver certificates. In 1890, the purchases required under the Bland–Allison Act were greatly increased under the terms of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Although the Sherman Act was repealed in 1893, it was not until 1904 that the government struck the last of the purchased silver into dollars. Once it did, production of the coin ceased.|$|E

5|$|The British {{government}} was also slow {{in responding to}} requests for compensation. While waiting for a response, {{the question of how}} to use any compensation was debated in provincial newspapers and pamphlets. Some, such as Samuel Adams (father of the famous American Revolution leader), advocated placing the money in London banks to serve as <b>backing</b> <b>for</b> the paper currency issued by the colonies. Others, including William Douglass and Thomas Hutchinson, speaker of the General Court, favoured using the compensation to redeem the paper currency and give Massachusetts a hard currency. In 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle returned Louibourg to France, with Massachusetts still awaiting compensation for its seizure.|$|E
5|$|The {{paramount}} chief maintained some loyalty for his subjects. He {{persuaded the}} Germans {{to carry out}} infrastructure improvements such as the building of roads, schools, health clinics, and churches; and he defended his subjects from colonial reprisals. In one instance, an Ewondo interpreter fired a gun during a dispute with a German, an offence punishable with a stiff prison sentence. Atangana interceded, and the man's punishment was reduced to porter duty. However, the paramount chief remained completely loyal to the governors. In 1914, for example, representatives of Duala leader Rudolf Duala Manga Bell tried to secure Atangana's <b>backing</b> <b>for</b> a pan-Kamerun revolt. Atangana kept the plot under wraps, but he instructed the envoy to urge Manga Bell to reconsider.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Roberts {{has been}} a strong proponent of raising the image of {{motorcycle}} racing among the general public.

The race eventually attained Grand Prix status in 1988 and in 1993, Roberts took on the role of promoter, providing financial <b>backing</b> <b>for</b> the 1993 United States Grand Prix. In the 1990s when Grand Prix racing faced diminishing numbers of competitors due to increasing costs, Roberts demanded that Yamaha provide engines to privateer teams in order to bolster the number of racers.|$|E

5|$|After {{hearing about}} the game's success, Bushnell decided {{there would be more}} profit for Atari to {{manufacture}} the game rather than license it, but the interest of Bally and Midway had already been piqued. Bushnell decided to inform each of the two groups that the other was uninterested—Bushnell told the Bally executives that the Midway executives did not want it and vice versa—to preserve the relationships for future dealings. Upon hearing Bushnell's comment, the two groups declined his offer. Bushnell had difficulty finding financial <b>backing</b> <b>for</b> Pong; banks viewed it as a variant of pinball, which at the time the general public associated with the Mafia. Atari eventually obtained a line of credit from Wells Fargo that it used to expand its facilities to house an assembly line. The company announced Pong on 29 November 1972. Management sought assembly workers at the local unemployment office, but was unable to keep up with demand. The first arcade cabinets produced were assembled very slowly, about ten machines a day, many of which failed quality testing. Atari eventually streamlined the process and began producing the game in greater quantities. By 1973, they began shipping Pong to other countries with the aid of foreign partners.|$|E
5|$|Corvinus {{was unwilling}} to break his own truce with Bayezid, having tacit Ottoman <b>backing</b> <b>for</b> his own war in the west. However, he granted his vassal a {{territorial}} gift in Transylvania, comprising the domains of Ciceu and Cetatea de Baltă. According to various interpretations, this exchange occurred in or after 1484, and was meant to compensate Stephen {{for the loss of}} his ports. Medievalist Marius Diaconescu dates the lease of Cetatea to 1482, when Corvinus agreed to give Stephen a place of refuge, should Moldavia fall to the Ottomans, while Ciceu only became Stephen's castle in 1489. Both citadels were on land confiscated after conflicts between the Three Nations and Corvinus. Ciceu had been a fief of the Losonczi family, under litigation, while Cetatea had been a special domain of the Voivode of Transylvania, whose last titular owner before Stephen was John Pongrác of Dengeleg.|$|E
5|$|With Mansur's rule lacking any strong foundation, {{his opponents}} among Aleppine factions or individuals, unnamed in sources, {{resolved}} {{to move against}} him and install Abu'l-Hayja' to the emirate. They gained {{the support of the}} Banu Kilab tribe, {{one of the most powerful}} elements in the emirate, and then appealed for the assistance of the Marwanid ruler of Diyar Bakr, Mumahhid al-Dawla; the latter was Abu'l-Hayja's father-in-law. Mumahhid al-Dawla secured Byzantine Emperor Basil II's permission for Abu'l-Hayja' to leave Byzantine territory and depose Mansur, provided that Mumahhid bear the financial expense of such an endeavor. Indeed, Mumahhid supplied Abu'l-Hayja' with money and 200 horsemen, and the Hamdanid was further promised the critical support of the Kilabi chieftains, whom he met on his way to Aleppo. However, once Mansur caught wind of the Kilab's <b>backing</b> <b>for</b> Abu'l-Hayja', he wrote to the tribe's chieftains, promising them a share of the Emirate of Aleppo's revenues and control of some of its rural areas in return for withdrawing their support for the Hamdanid. Moreover, Mansur appealed for military aid from Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim; Mansur promised to allow a Fatimid-appointed governor control the Citadel of Aleppo in return for such aid, which came in the form of Fatimid troops from Tripoli.|$|E
