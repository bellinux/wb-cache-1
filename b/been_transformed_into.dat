He is depicted as flirtatious, as he is frequently seen with the Featherduster and immediately takes a liking to Belle. A running gag throughout the movie is Lumière burning Cogsworth. Nik Ranieri served as the supervising animator for Lumière.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota has {{an active}} program of {{organized}} amateur and professional sports. Tourism {{has become an}} important industry, especially in the Lake region. In the North Country, what had been an industrial area focused on mining and timber has largely <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a vacation destination. Popular interest in the environment and environmentalism, added to traditional interests in hunting and fishing, has attracted a large urban audience within driving range.|$|E
5|$|Somewhat later, andesitic lavas {{poured out}} {{from what is}} now Reading Peak and mainly flowed {{to the south and}} east, {{reaching}} the head of Warner Valley. By this time, the park's eastern portion had <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a relatively flat plain. The activity was followed by an eruption of the Eastern basalts from volcanoes east of the park. These thick flows have subsequently eroded to produce rugged hills that limit the park on the east. Taken together, these various flows built the lava plateau that the Lassen volcanic area is located on.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} {{struggling}} to find space to rehearse and perform by 1989. The Students' Building where Philaletheis had once performed had <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> the All Campus Dining Center and the old performance space was neither replaced nor replicated elsewhere on campus. To rememdy this, in 1993 and 1994, Vassar invested in the renovation {{of one of its}} disused buildings, a former functioning coal bin, into the Coal Bin Theater to be used by Philaletheis and the other student theatre and comedy groups that had been created by this time.|$|E
50|$|Autonomous {{systems are}} closely related to {{dynamical}} systems. Any autonomous system can <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a dynamical system and, using very weak assumptions, a dynamical system can <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> an autonomous system.|$|R

5|$|After {{moving to}} Barcelona, Gaudí {{frequently}} changed his address: {{as a student}} he lived in residences, generally {{in the area of}} the Gothic Quarter; when he started his career he moved around several rented flats in the Eixample area. Finally, in 1906, he settled in a house in the Güell Park that he owned and which had been constructed by his assistant Francesc Berenguer as a showcase property for the estate. It has since <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> the Gaudí Museum. There he lived with his father (who died in 1906 at the age of 93) and his niece Rosa Egea Gaudí (who died in 1912 at the age of 36). He lived in the house until 1925, several months before his death, when he began residing inside the workshop of the Sagrada Família.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, the two {{follow the}} cloud to a castle. There, the cloud {{condenses}} into a demonic form, presumably Hunson Abadeer. While {{running through the}} castle, Finn and Jake find a portal back to Ooo, and the two jump in, with Abadeer in pursuit. Finn wounds the demon with his sword. At that moment it is revealed that the demon is not Hunson Abadeer, but rather Marceline, who has for some unknown reason, <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a hideous demon. She musters enough strength to forbid Finn and Jake from {{coming back to the}} Nightosphere, and, after the two are teleported back to their dimension, she closes the portal.|$|E
5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged {{to buy the}} bulbs. The decree {{changed the nature of}} these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> options contracts. This proposal began to be debated in the fall of 1636, and if it became clear to investors that the decree was likely to be enacted, prices probably would have risen.|$|E

50|$|The ASSR did {{not exist}} in its {{original}} state very long. Already on September 1, 1921 Kabardin Okrug was split from the ASSR as separate Kabardin Autonomous Okrug, subordinated directly to the RSFSR. Next came Karachay Okrug, which <b>was</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> Karachay Autonomous Okrug on January 12, 1922; Balkar Okrug, which <b>was</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> Balkar Autonomous Okrug on January 16, 1922; and Chechen Okrug, which <b>was</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> the Chechen Autonomous Oblast on November 30, 1922.|$|R

5|$|Die Another Day had {{its world}} premiere on 18 November 2002 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of honour, {{making it the}} second Bond film premiere to be {{attended}} by the Queen, the first one being You Only Live Twice in 1967. The Royal Albert Hall had a make-over for the screening and had <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> an ice palace. Proceeds from the première, about £500,000, were donated to the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund of which the Queen is patron. On the first day, ticket sales reached £1.2 million. Die Another Day was the highest grossing James Bond film until the release of Casino Royale. It earned $432 million worldwide, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 2002.|$|E
5|$|Just {{across the}} town line, NY33A intersects {{the east end}} of the Airport Expressway (NY204). At this point, NY204 leaves the highway and turns to follow NY33A eastward. While most of NY33A west of Gates is a two-lane highway, the portion of Chili Avenue that carries both NY33A and NY204 is a four-lane roadway. The two routes soon enter Tressmar, a hamlet that has <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a major {{commercial}} destination. The development is mostly centered on Westgate Plaza, a large shopping plaza anchored by a Walmart. As NY33A passes south of the plaza, it connects to Howard Road (unsigned NY940L and formerly part of NY47) and Brooks Avenue. NY204 leaves NY33A at Brooks Avenue to follow the road eastward toward the Greater Rochester International Airport.|$|E
5|$|On 12 October 1917, the 34th Battalion—as {{a member}} of the 9th Brigade—was {{to take part in the}} 3rd Australian Division's attack on Passchendaele, Belgium. Subject to several days of heavy rain, the {{battlefield}} had <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a boggy marsh on which the attack was to commence. Jeffries commanded B Company during the attack, which he halted at the entrance to Broodseinde railway cutting, as many of the direction tapes leading to the starting position had been destroyed or swallowed up by the mud. To avoid any mishaps, Jeffries and another of the battalion's company commanders, Captain T.G. Gilder, pushed on alone as far as Keerselaarhoek cemetery to find the tapes marking the battalions starting line for the attack. Thus, by 03:00 the 34th Battalion was formed up on the line of attack.|$|E

Willow tries to restore Raziel, but turns her into a rook instead. Madmartigan is dosed with love dust by the brownies and declares his undying love for Sorsha. The prisoners escape and reach a village {{at the foot of}} a mountain, where they again encounter Airk and the remains of his army, recently defeated by Bavmorda's forces. Madmartigan proclaims his loyalty to the Nelwyn and promises to protect Willow and Elora.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 2, {{known in}} Japan as Biohazard 2, is a 1998 {{survival}} horror video game originally released for the PlayStation. Developed by Capcom {{as the second}} installment in the Resident Evil series, its story takes place {{two months after the}} events of the first game, Resident Evil. It is set in Raccoon City, an American community whose residents have <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> zombies by the T-virus, a biological weapon developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. In their escape from the city, the two protagonists, Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, encounter other survivors, and are confronted by William Birkin, the mutated creator of the even more powerful weaponized pathogen, the G-virus.|$|E
5|$|The castle's fourth corner forms its {{gatehouse}}. Here {{the classic}} Edwardian gatehouse design has <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> an asymmetrical structure, with one tower {{much larger than}} the other. The gatehouse included portcullises, murder-holes and a drawbridge. Beyond the gatehouse lies a large barbican, inspired by a similar design of the period at the Tower of London and possibly built by the same workmen, designed to protect the causeway leading to the gatehouse. The barbican today is only half of its original height, and includes its own gate, designed to trap intruders within the inner defences. The gatehouse and barbican are linked by a stone causeway.|$|E

500|$|Thus, if P lies {{outside the}} circle, then P' lies within, and vice versa. When P {{is the same}} as O, the {{inversion}} is said to send P to infinity. (In complex analysis, [...] "infinity" [...] is defined in terms of the Riemann sphere.) Inversion has the useful property that lines and circles <b>are</b> always <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> lines and circles, and points <b>are</b> always <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> points. Circles <b>are</b> generally <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> other circles under inversion; however, if a circle passes {{through the center of the}} inversion circle, it <b>is</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a straight line, and vice versa. Importantly, if a circle crosses the circle of inversion at right angles (intersects perpendicularly), it is left unchanged by the inversion; it <b>is</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> itself.|$|R
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an isometric format. The player assumes {{the role of a}} knight who enters the plague-infested village of Nightshade to vanquish four demons who reside within. Additionally, all residents from the village have <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> vampires and other supernatural creatures. Contact with these monsters infects the knight, with repeated contact turning the character from white to yellow and then to green, which will lead to the character's death. The knight may be hit up to three times by an enemy, however the fourth hit will result in a life being deducted.|$|E
5|$|Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas {{and many}} of the Southern {{primaries}} on Super Tuesday gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California Governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South. With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate. Having <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown's home state of California.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, Istanbul had {{established}} itself as a regional artistic center, with Turkish, European, and Middle Eastern artists flocking to the city. Despite efforts to make Ankara Turkey's cultural heart, Istanbul had the country's primary institution of art until the 1970s. When additional universities and art journals were founded in Istanbul during the 1980s, artists formerly based in Ankara moved in. Beyoğlu has <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> the artistic center of the city, with young artists and older Turkish artists formerly residing abroad finding footing there. Modern art museums, including İstanbul Modern, the Pera Museum, Sakıp Sabancı Museum and SantralIstanbul, opened in the 2000s to complement the exhibition spaces and auction houses that have already contributed to the cosmopolitan nature of the city. These museums have yet to attain the popularity of older museums on the historic peninsula, including the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, which ushered in the era of modern museums in Turkey, and the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum.|$|E
