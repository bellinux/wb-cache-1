5|$|With the {{encouragement}} of his Protestant advisers, James summoned the English Parliament in 1624 {{so that he could}} request subsidies for a war. Charles and Buckingham supported the impeachment of the Lord Treasurer, Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex, who opposed war on grounds of cost and who quickly fell in much the same manner as Bacon had. James told Buckingham he was a fool, and presciently warned his son that he would live to regret the revival of impeachment as a parliamentary tool. An under-funded makeshift army under Ernst von Mansfeld set off to recover the Palatinate, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> poorly provisioned that it never advanced beyond the Dutch coast.|$|E
5|$|The 1913 {{edition of}} the Catholic Encyclopedia lists several {{separate}} accounts of the saint's deeds and miracles, or so-called Lives. The Life (or Vita) printed in John Capgrave's Nova, Legenda and used by the Bollandists, was perhaps copied from a Cotton manuscript in the British Museum. There is another Vita in Latin in the same collection, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> damaged by fire that it is useless. The surviving versions of the Vita Sexburge were compiled after 1106 (the year the relics of Seaxburh were translated) and are copies from an earlier manuscript, now lost. The Vita describes Seaxburh's early life, marriage to Eorcenberht, withdrawal to Milton and then Minster-in-Sheppey, and her final years as a nun and the abbess at Ely. The section relating to her life at Sheppey is similar to another fragment, dating between the 9th and 11th centuries, and currently kept at Lambeth Palace. It {{has been suggested that}} part of the Vita Sexburge was derived from this manuscript, or that both parts originated from an earlier version of Seaxburh's Life.|$|E

25|$|During the First World War, {{the mill}} {{was used by}} {{a unit of the}} Royal Army Veterinary Corps. The cap and sails were blown off in about 1920 and it was decided to {{demolish}} the mill, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> solidly built that work was halted when just over one storey had been removed. The empty mill tower stood for many years with jagged brickwork. In 1998, the mill tower was converted to serve as holiday accommodation. The conversion of the mill was rewarded by an Enhancement Award for Conservation by Broadland District Council.|$|E
25|$|Euclid (c. 325-265 BC), of Alexandria, {{probably}} {{a student at}} the Academy founded by Plato, wrote a treatise in 13 books (chapters), titled The Elements of Geometry, in which he presented geometry in an ideal axiomatic form, which {{came to be known as}} Euclidean geometry. The treatise is not a compendium of all that the Hellenistic mathematicians knew at the time about geometry; Euclid himself wrote eight more advanced books on geometry. We know from other references that Euclid’s was not the first elementary geometry textbook, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> much superior that the others fell into disuse and were lost. He was brought to the university at Alexandria by Ptolemy I, King of Egypt.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Evans & Sutherland (E) {{decoupled}} their PS300 graphics processor/display, which contained its own display information transformable through a dataflow architecture. Complex graphical objects could be downloaded over a serial line (e.g. 9600, 56K baud) or Ethernet interface and then manipulated without {{impact on the}} host. The architecture was excellent for high performance display but very inconvenient for domain-specific calculations, such as electron-density fitting and energy calculations. Many crystallographers and modellers spent arduous months trying to fit such activities into this architecture. E designed a card for the PS-300 which had several calculation algorithms using a 100 bit wide finite state machine {{in an attempt to}} simplify this process <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> difficult to program that it quickly became obsolete.|$|E

25|$|A {{force of}} 65 Heinkel He 111s participated from Sola and Kjevik in the raid on Britain, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> {{unsuccessful}} that Luftflotte 5 {{would no longer}} {{play a role in}} attacks on Britain. The Wehrmacht gave up on its original plan on 15 September, which also changed the anticipated role for Sola and Forus. The importance of Sola and Forus thus became the need to defend from British attacks, rather than offense. Forus became part of Festung Stavanger—a heavy construction of defensive structures in Jæren—which {{played a key role in}} Festung Norwegen. This massive endeavor created a surge in the demand for labor, while the wartime halt to commerce escalated unemployment. Construction was therefore typically carried out by Norwegians, partially voluntary, partially out of dire hunger and partially by force. After the war progressed, work was gradually taken more over by Russian prisoners of war.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{the fair}} was {{scheduled}} only to run until November 12, 1933, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> successful {{that it was}} opened again to run from May 26 to October 31, 1934. The fair was financed through the sale of memberships, which allowed purchases of {{a certain number of}} admissions once the park was open. More than $800,000 was raised in this manner as the country came out of the Great Depression. A $10million bond was issued on October 28, 1929, the day before the stock market crashed. By the time the fair closed in 1933, half of these notes had been retired, with the entire debt paid by the time the fair closed in 1934. For the first time in American history, an international fair had paid for itself. In its two years, it had attracted 48,769,227 visitors. According to James Truslow Adams's Dictionary of American History, during the 170 days beginning May 27, 1933, there were 22,565,859 paid admissions; during the 163 days beginning May 26, 1934, there were 16,486,377; a total of 39,052,236.|$|E

In order to save his brother's life, Michael creates an elaborate plan to help his brother escape from prison. In an interview, Paul Scheuring recalled that most of the actors who tested for the role [...] "would come in playing mysterious, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> cheesy and false." [...] A week before the start of production, Miller auditioned for the role and impressed Scheuring with his performance; he was cast the following day.|$|E

500|$|As {{inspiration}} for the album, Duff cited indie rock band The Faint and pop singers such as Gwen Stefani and Beyoncé, while critics compared her musical style with Stefani, Janet Jackson, Depeche Mode, Madonna and Justin Timberlake. Duff felt that the album's dance-pop themes were a deviation from the pop rock of her previous albums. [...] "I didn't necessarily plan the album to sound like this, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> easy to write to," [...] she said. Critics have noted that Dignitys musical style is dance-pop and electropop, with influences of hip hop, rock and roll and Middle Eastern music.

500|$|Following Butler's exit, sole {{remaining}} {{original member}} Tony Iommi put Black Sabbath on hiatus, and {{began work on}} a solo album with long-time Sabbath keyboardist Geoff Nicholls. While working on new material, the original Black Sabbath line-up were offered a spot at Bob Geldof's Live Aid benefit concert; the band agreed, performing at the Philadelphia show, on 13 July 1985. The event {{marked the first time}} the original line-up appeared on stage since 1978, and also featured reunions of the Who and Led Zeppelin. Returning to his solo work, Iommi enlisted bassist Dave Spitz, drummer Eric Singer and initially intended to use multiple singers, including Rob Halford of Judas Priest, former Deep Purple and Trapeze vocalist Glenn Hughes, and former Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio. This plan didn't work as he forecasted. [...] "We were going to use different vocalists on the album, guest vocalists, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> difficult getting it together and getting releases from their record companies. Glenn Hughes came along to sing on one track and we decided to use him on the whole album." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1919, the MSHD signposted {{the highway}} {{system for the}} first time, and the future US27 {{corridor}} through Charlotte {{was part of the}} original M-29. On November 11, 1926, the United States Numbered Highway System was approved by the AASHO and the new US27 replaced M-29 through Coldwater. By the end of the next year, M-78 was extended from downtown Charlotte along US27 to run northeasterly toward Lansing. The highway through downtown Charlotte was first designated Bus. US27 after the 1961 completion of a non-freeway bypass, a two-lane, limited-access highway east of the city. At that point I-69 only existed in the southern parts of Michigan. That freeway was not extended up to the city when the southernmost segment of I-69 was completed in 1967. [...] By 1971, I-69 was completed to Charlotte and at the time US27 was cosigned with I-69, the bypass being incorporated into I-69. For three years the business loop in Charlotte was not signed as BL I-69, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> designated in 1974 and Bus. US27 was decommissioned in and near Charlotte.|$|E

500|$|There are {{two major}} {{instances}} of allusions to environmental issues within the movie. The first is seen when Chihiro {{is dealing with the}} [...] "stink spirit." [...] The stink spirit was actually a river spirit, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> corrupted with filth that one couldn't tell what it was at first glance. It only became clean again when Chihiro pulled out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go. The second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of human's need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and desertification; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but don't think about how it can affect other living things.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Stransky was {{favorable}} of both Strong's narration {{and performance}} in the fifth season episode [...] "The Best Thing That Could Have Ever Happened", describing Mary Alice's role in the episode as [...] "heartbreaking" [...] and writing: [...] "I know we hear Brenda Strong nearly every week in her voiceovers, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> nice to see her on screen again! That lady can act." [...] Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic was bored by Mary Alice's flashback scenes in the sixth season episode [...] "Epiphany", believing them to be unrealistic. Daniel Goldberg of Slant Magazine praised Mary Alice's narration in the series finale in 2012, writing: [...] "There was one resolution that truly resonated. When the ladies all move out of [...] Lane and politely promise {{to keep in touch}} and visit, Mary Alice (Brenda Strong) takes the opportunity to unearth one last lie. With one of her most somber voiceovers ever, she lets us in on a secret that the housewives already know: They won’t keep in touch, and they won’t visit. The moment is far more unsettling and existential than the overblown sequence of the desperately deceased gathering to wave Susan goodbye. Deep friendships and passing acquaintances can never be replicated, and these are the endings we experience every day, even as we try to deny their finality." [...] Writing for Backstage magazine in 2012, Jeffery Self wrote that Strong's narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming [...] "one of the most familiar on television". As a result of her popularity as the series' narrator, Anna Silman of Vulture magazine described Strong as [...] "everybody's favorite deceased housewife/omniscient narrator" [...] in 2014.|$|E
