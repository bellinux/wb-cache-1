These types of applications are called stateless applications, and typically include Web, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and virtual private networking (VPN) servers. Every client request to a stateless application is a separate transaction, so it is possible to distribute the requests among multiple servers to balance the load. One attractive feature of NLBS is that all servers in a cluster monitor each other with a heartbeat signal, so there is no single point of failure.|$|E

40|$|Around the world, {{there are}} a number of {{policies}} encouraging penetration of wind generation in the electricity industry. The proposed large increase in the penetration of wind generation has raised concerns about the continued security and reliability of the operation of the network. The Market participants who are willing to provide the <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> offer their services to the Transmission System Operator, TSO. In case of any system imbalances, the offers are listed in a merit order list and the cheapest offer will be selected. This selection is regardless of balancing service provider’s nationality. If congestion happens, some other offers will be used to relieve congested line. This results in different prices for <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> in different areas. This methodology is based on the corrective actions in the market for <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> given the dispatch information from the spot market. With the increased penetration of wind generation into the electricity industry, the demand for <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> is increasing. Under these windy scenarios, it might be more efficient to use preventive actions in the spot market rather than doing corrective actions in the Market for <b>balancing</b> <b>services.</b> This master thesis aims at showing the advantages of this new paradigm of the organization of the electricity market based on preventive actions. With this purpose, an integrated model of the electricity market was built in GAMS software and run for different scenarios and configurations of the grid.

40|$|As middleware-based {{distributed}} applications become more pervasive, {{the need to}} improve the scalability of these applications becomes increasingly important. One way to improve scalability is via load balancing. Earlier generations of middleware-based load <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> were simplistic, however, since they focused on specific use-cases and environments, which made it hard to use these services for anything other than a small class of {{distributed applications}}. This lack of generality also often forced continuous redevelopment of application-specific load <b>balancing</b> <b>services,</b> which increases distributed applications deployment and optimization costs. Recent advances in the design and implementation of middleware-based load <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> overcome these limitations through several techniques, including (1) support for adaptive load balancing strategies which allows a load balancer to be applied {{to a wide variety of}} applications, (2) load metric neutrality which further allows a load balancer to remain non-application specific, and (3) server-side transparency, which prevents application implementations from being complicated by adding load balancing support...|$|E

To this end, they procure so-called <b>balancing</b> <b>services.</b> This thesis studies the design and integration of markets for <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> in Europe. Contrary to previous academic work in this field, it approaches balancing markets from a broad perspective  i. e. as comprising the procurement of <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> and the settlement of imbalances  and {{takes into account the}} interrelationship between both components. The first part of this thesis focuses on the current  predominantly national  organisation of balancing markets in Europe. It identifies and analyses main design parameters and puts forward an appropriate market design based thereon. This design proposal ensures both market-based balancing service procurement prices and cost-reflective imbalance prices. The second part of this thesis considers the implementation of cross-border balancing markets. It first discusses different implementation proposals and qualitatively assesses the benefits and implementation costs they each may entail using a self-developed framework. It further proposes methodologies to quantitatively assess the welfare gains of implementing cross-border procurement as well as the welfare distorting impact of implementing cross-border settlement in case of structurally differing imbalance settlement methods. Both methodologies are applied to the Belgian-Dutch border. nrpages: 159 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. CORBA is {{a widely}} used {{solution}} for distributed object application. Currently, object implementations facilitate object group model to organize the object services. In addition {{to the complexity of}} object grouping, researchers also seek {{to improve the quality of}} service (QoS) by various means such as implementing load balancing to the system. This paper deals with the proposed load <b>balancing</b> <b>service</b> of distributed object groups. The proposed load <b>balancing</b> <b>service</b> uses the dynamic replication scheme which is mechanized by flow balance assumption (FBA) that derives from the arrival and service rate to execute request forwarding to new objects. The proposed on-demand replication scheme adjusts the number of replicated objects based on the arrival rate to minimize the waiting time of clients. It consists of procedures such as intercepting the request and executing on-demand activation of objects. The result of the simulation shows the improvement of the total mean client request completion time of the system as compared to other load balancing schemes. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{patchwork}} of different imbalance-settlement rules in geographically adjacent gas regions induces shippers to go “forum shopping” to minimize costs of ex-post <b>balancing</b> <b>services.</b> This shopping increases efficiency, and thus {{welfare of the}} shippers, on the one hand. The impact on net efficiency {{is dependent on the}} relative incentives provided by different balancing mechanisms and the relative system-balancing costs that the transmission-system operators face to offer <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> to unbalanced shippers, on the other hand. If the gas-balancing mechanism and the system-balancing costs are aligned, net efficiency in the combined gas system will rise. Our results demonstrate that such an outcome is not guaranteed. Hence, market integration without properly checking compatibility of balancing rules can improve shipper efficiency at the cost of reducing overall efficiency. The latter outcome should clearly be avoided by policy makers and European regulators whose primary concern should be overall efficiency as this provides fair and efficient prices for gas consumers and a higher utility for society. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} ensure a stable {{operation}} of the power system, Transmission System Operators have to balance production and consumption of electiricty continuously. For this purpose <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> are utilised. With the European objective to migrate to a sustainable power production, a significant share of generation {{is expected to be}} from renewable sources, with its inherent production forecast errors. To balance this variable production, the requirement for <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> increases. The Nordic, particularly the Norwegian hydrobased power system is predestinated of providing such <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> to the continental European power system. This thesis studies the integration of national regulating power markets, enabling the cross-border exchange of <b>balancing</b> <b>services</b> in Northern Europe. The research encompasses the development of a mathematical model for the regulating power market, which is based on a day-ahead spot market model. Furthermore, data models for the Northern European power system are developed. Succeedingly, these models are utilised for a set of case studies. The first part of the thesis focuses on the model development and implementation of system scenarios. The mathematical model of the regulating power market comprises the procurement as well as activation of regulating reserves and explicitly addresses the exchange of <b>balancing</b> <b>services.</b> This model is used to assess the integration of national regulating power markets. Two detailed data models are compiled, encompassing 2010 ’s and 2020 ’s state of the Northern European power system. For these scenarios the outcome of the the day-ahead spot market is analysed, which shows significant changes in the future system dispatch. Taking the system dispatch as input to the regulating power market model, its market outcome is investigated. The analysis illustrates significant cost savings for the integration of national regulating power markets. The second part of the thesis comprises a set of analyses, executed with the developed models. The increase in power production from renewable energy sources, especially wind power production is taken as a basis for the future development of the power system. With the changes in the power production portfolio in Northern Europe, including higher variability and increased production forecast error, the future outcome of the regulating power market is studied. Moreover, the impact of various forecast horizons for wind power production and the definition of different reserve requirement levels are investigated. In general the analyses illustrate the challenges due to increased power production from renewable sources. These result in higher system imbalances and hence costs in the regulating power market. It is shown, that an integration of national regulating power markets in Northern Europe provides a good possibility to counteract this cost increase, while the system security is enhanced.
