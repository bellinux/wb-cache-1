5|$|Pittsburgh {{citizens}} {{helped to}} defuse the threat by banishing three men whose intercepted letters had given offense to the rebels, and <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> delegation to Braddock's Field that expressed support for the gathering. Brackenridge prevailed upon the crowd to limit the protest to a defiant march through the town. In Pittsburgh, Major Kirkpatrick's barns were burned, but nothing else.|$|E

5|$|Despite Swedish {{hopes that}} the Dutch would not enter the conflict, they honored their 1649 treaty <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> 45-ship relief fleet. On October 7, 1658 the Dutch fleet set sail from Vlie. Two weeks later, on October 22, it {{anchored}} northwest of Helsingør, unable to proceed for six days due to wind conditions. Wrangel suggested the Swedes should attack, but Charles X still wanted to avoid provoking the Dutch.|$|E

5|$|During the Quasi-War, the United States {{paid tribute}} to the Barbary States {{to ensure that they}} would not seize or harass American {{merchant}} ships. In 1801 Yusuf Karamanli of Tripoli, dissatisfied with the amount of tribute in comparison to that paid to Algiers, demanded an immediate payment of $250,000. Thomas Jefferson responded <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> squadron of warships to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and to pursue peace with the Barbary States.|$|E
5|$|In 179 BC Philip died. His {{talented and}} ambitious son, Perseus, took the throne and showed a renewed {{interest}} in conquering Greece. With her Greek allies facing a major new threat, Rome declared war on Macedonia again, starting the Third Macedonian War. Perseus initially had some success against the Romans. However, Rome responded <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> stronger army. This second consular army decisively defeated the Macedonians at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC and the Macedonians duly capitulated, ending the war.|$|E
5|$|In 965 or 966, a Bulgarian embassy {{visited the}} Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II Phokas (r. 963–969) at Constantinople {{to receive the}} annual tribute that had been agreed by the two powers {{as the price of}} peace in 927. Phokas, flush and self-confident from a series of {{victories}} against the Arabs in the East that had led to the recovery of Crete, Cyprus and Cilicia, refused to comply, and even had the envoys beaten up. He followed this up with a show of military strength, <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> small force to raze a number of Bulgarian border posts in Thrace.|$|E

Other sources state that Eduardo was killed when an explosive device detonated underneath his chair at the FRELIMO headquarters, and that the faction responsible was never identified.|$|E
5|$|The aborigines signalled their {{surrender}} <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> few {{of their}} best weapons to the Dutch, and then by bringing a small tree (often betel nut) planted in earth from their village as a token of the granting of sovereignty to the VOC. Over {{the next few months}} as word of the Dutch victory spread, more and more villages came to pay their respects at Fort Zeelandia and assure the VOC of their friendly intentions. However, the new masters of Mattau also inherited their enemies, with both Favorlang and Tirosen expressing hostility towards the VOC in the wake of their victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{inhabitants}} of San Salvador, {{alarmed by the}} uprising engulfing the region, responded <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> great quantity of weapons, armour, gunpowder, and other supplies to Montejo in Honduras. One hundred Indian auxiliaries were also sent, with one thousand native porters. Further supplies were forthcoming from the embattled residents of San Miguel. By the end of 1538, Lempira's stronghold had been taken by the Spanish, and Montejo crossed from Honduras to San Miguel to assist in putting down continued indigenous resistance in the district.|$|E

5|$|Through Bar Sauma {{and other}} later envoys, such as Buscarello de Ghizolfi, Arghun promised the European leaders that if Jerusalem were conquered, {{he would have}} himself baptized and would return Jerusalem to the Christians. Bar Sauma was greeted warmly by the European monarchs, but Western Europe was no longer as {{interested}} in the Crusades, and the mission to form an alliance was ultimately fruitless. England did respond <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> representative, Geoffrey of Langley, {{who had been a}} member of Edward I's Crusade 20 years earlier, and was sent to the Mongol court as an ambassador in 1291.|$|E

5|$|Arsène Lupin III, the {{grandson}} of the fictional gentleman thief, Arsène Lupin, is considered the world's greatest thief, known for announcing his intentions to steal valuable objects <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> calling card to the owners of his desired items. His right-hand man and closest ally is Daisuke Jigen, an expert marksman who can accurately shoot a target in 0.3 seconds. Although Lupin and Jigen frequently work as a two-man team, they are often joined by Goemon Ishikawa XIII, a master swordsman whose sword can cut anything, or Fujiko Mine, a femme fatale and Lupin's love interest. Although Fujiko usually works together with the others, she occasionally exploits Lupin's interest in her to steal the treasure for herself. Lupin and his gang are constantly chased by Inspector Koichi Zenigata of the ICPO, who has made it his life's work to arrest them, pursuing Lupin across the globe.|$|E

5|$|Boston, {{the capital}} of the Province of Massachusetts Bay and an {{important}} shipping town, was a major center of resistance to unpopular acts of taxation by the British Parliament in the 1760s. In 1768, the Townshend Acts were placed upon the colonists, by which a variety of common items that were manufactured in Britain and exported to the colonies were subjected to import tariffs. Colonists objected that the Townshend Acts were a violation of the natural, charter, and constitutional rights of British subjects in the colonies. The Massachusetts House of Representatives began a campaign against the Townshend Acts <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> petition to King George III asking for the repeal of the Townshend Revenue Act. The House also sent {{what became known as the}} Massachusetts Circular Letter to other colonial assemblies, asking them to join the resistance movement, and called for a boycott of merchants importing the affected goods.|$|E
5|$|Further {{south in}} the Deccan region, a Hoysala commander, Singeya Nayaka-III (1280–1300 AD) {{declared}} independence after the Muslim forces of the Delhi Sultanate defeated and captured the territories of the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri in 1294 CE. He created the Kampili kingdom, {{but this was a}} short lived kingdom during this period of wars. Kampili existed near Gulbarga and Tungabhadra river in northeastern parts of the present-day Karnataka state. It ended after a defeat by the armies of Delhi Sultanate. The triumphant army led by Malik Zada sent the news of its victory, over Kampili kingdom, to Muhammad bin Tughluq in Delhi <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> straw-stuffed severed head of the dead Hindu king. Within Kampili, on the day of certain defeat, the populace committed a jauhar (ritual mass suicide) in 1327/28 CE. Eight years later, from the ruins of the Kampili kingdom emerged the Vijayanagara Kingdom in 1336 CE.|$|E
5|$|If the {{governor}} becomes incapacitated, then the Lieutenant Governor of Indiana becomes acting-governor until his recovery. Only two governors have become incapacitated during their terms, and current precedent is that {{the governor}}'s office is to notify the lieutenant governor, who will then {{make the decision to}} become acting governor by notifying the General Assembly by letter. The governor can resume his powers and duties <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> letter to the General Assembly notifying them that he is again capable of executing the duties of office. If the governor resigns, dies, or is impeached, tried, and convicted, then the lieutenant governor becomes governor. If the office of the lieutenant governor is vacant, then the Senate Pro-Tempore becomes governor. If the office of Senate President pro tempore is also vacant, then the Senate must elect a new Pro-Tempore to fill the governor's office.|$|E

5|$|In 1457, Skanderbeg had {{achieved}} {{his most famous}} victory over the Ottoman Empire at Albulena (Ujëbardha), which was received with great enthusiasm throughout Italy. In order to repay Alfonso for the financial and military assistance given to him years before, Skanderbeg took up the pope's pleas to help out Alfonso's son <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> military expedition to Italy. Before leaving, Skanderbeg tried to negotiate a ceasefire with Sultan Mehmed II, the conqueror of Constantinople, to ensure his domain's safety. Mehmed had not declared a truce {{and he was still}} sending his armies against Bosnia and the Morea. It was not until 1459, after Mehmed's conquest of Serbia, that Mehmed not only declared a truce, but also a three-year ceasefire with Skanderbeg. This gave Skanderbeg his opportunity to send his men to Italy.|$|E
5|$|Joining Mikulski as an {{advocate}} for servicing Hubble was NASA's Chief Scientist, physicist John Grunsfeld, who {{was present at the}} meeting when O'Keefe announced the cancellation of the mission. A veteran astronaut of four shuttle missions, including two Hubble servicing missions, Grunsfeld had devoted years to Hubble, and was very disappointed when O'Keefe canceled the mission. He briefly considered retiring from NASA, but realized if he stayed, he could continue to advance physics in other ways. Instead, Grunsfeld dedicated himself to finding alternate ways to service the telescope, possibly <b>by</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> robot into orbit to do the job. When O'Keefe announced his resignation as Administrator in December 2004, five days after a National Academy of Sciences committee opposed O'Keefe's position regarding servicing Hubble, the media and science community saw hope for the telescope's servicing mission to be reinstated.|$|E
