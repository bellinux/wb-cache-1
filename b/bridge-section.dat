5000|$|Due to the album's title, many {{speculated that}} it would be the band's last release, {{although}} the title refers to, literally, end-of-the-album drum hits by drummer Brendan Canty that occur after the last song on the album, [...] "F/D" [...] ends. These drum hits are actually outtakes from the <b>bridge-section</b> of the track [...] "No Surprise," [...] the fourth song on the album. The title was later revealed to have been an inside-joke by the band.|$|E
50|$|The Hornet {{structure}} is built up from aluminium tubing, riveted together with gussets. The aircraft is then covered with doped aircraft fabric. The Hornet's wing incorporates dual <b>bridge-section</b> spars, {{with a single}} strut and V-jury struts. The wing was sandbag-tested to 7g without failure. The aircraft includes electric flaps and trim, dual controls and two wing-mounted fuel tanks. The landing gear incorporates pneumatic suspension on all three wheels, including the steerable nosewheel, and hydraulic brakes on the mainwheels. The Hornet can also be equipped with floats or skis. Early production aircraft experienced elevator flutter at speeds in excess of 100 mph but this was addressed by mass-balancing the elevator.|$|E
5000|$|... 'I Can Help' {{was written}} during March 1974, and also {{during that time}} Billy Swan {{recorded}} it with producer and engineer Chip Young at the Young'un Sound studio in Murfreesboro, TN. The distinctive keyboards were played by Swan on a portable Farfisa belonging to Memphis session musician Bobby Emmons while Chip's German Shepherd puppy, Bowser tugged on his pants leg. The vocals were recorded with a Neumann U47, while Swan's Farfisa, Mike Leech's bass and Reggie Young's guitar, were all recorded direct. Dennis Linde and Johnny Christopher, who performed for the song on acoustic guitars, were each miked with Sony ECM lapel mics, while the setup for Hayword Bishop's drums comprised another pair of ECMs overhead on the cymbals, an Electrovoice RE15 on the toms, an RE20 on the kick and a Shure SM58 on the snare. Keyboardist Bobby Wood was also booked for the session, but after hearing the track and realising he wasn't needed he joined Emmons and Young in the control room. Emmons and Young suggested overdubbing handclaps at the end to convey an in-studio party atmosphere, as well as adding some <b>bridge-section</b> backing vocals by Lea Jane Berinati and the Holliday Sisters. Swan recalls, [...] "Chip was excited after he recorded that part, but I {{went out there and}} listened to it, and I said, 'Boy, I don't know.' I listened to it over and over, until finally I said, 'Hey, man, nothing else will work.' It was actually a great solo, so that just shows you where my head is at. That part was so perfect, and today a lot of people remember the song because of that solo." ...|$|E
