5|$|According to the behind-the-scenes {{documentary}} {{portions of}} the film's DVD, there were slight continuity problems during the filming of the fight. This {{was said to have}} <b>been</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the fact that real punches were thrown by both Stallone and Tarver, resulting in some swelling and nosebleeds earlier than scripted. The DVD release features an alternate ending in which Rocky wins the fight.|$|E
5|$|By 1915 when Tolkien {{was writing}} his first elven poems, the words elf, fairy and gnome had many {{divergent}} and contradictory associations. Tolkien had been gently warned against {{using the term}} 'fairy', which John Garth supposes may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the word becoming increasingly used to indicate homosexuality, although despite this warning Tolkien continued to use it.|$|E
5|$|Edwards' {{re-election}} {{was more}} difficult. In four months {{he had lost}} the temporary support of Thomas' allies in the General Assembly who had voted for him in 1818. He narrowly defeated Thomas partisan Michael Jones {{by a vote of}} 23–19. This may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the influence of the powerful Secretary of State Elias Kane, a Thomas ally.|$|E
50|$|A {{review of}} common factors {{research}} in 2008 suggested that 30% to 70% {{of the variance}} in therapy outcome <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> common factors.

5|$|Much of {{this has}} {{probably}} <b>been</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its wealth of skeletal remains and former status as the longest dinosaur. The donation of many mounted skeletal casts by industrialist Andrew Carnegie to potentates around {{the world at the}} beginning of the 20th century did much to familiarize it to people worldwide. Casts of Diplodocus skeletons are still displayed in many museums worldwide, including D. carnegii in a number of institutions.|$|E

5|$|Ain't meaning didn't {{is widely}} {{considered}} a feature unique to African American Vernacular English, although {{it can be found}} in some dialects of Caribbean English as well. It may function not as a true variant of didn't, but as a creole-like tense-neutral negator (sometimes termed generic ain't). Its origin may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> approximation when early African Americans acquired English as a second language; {{it is also possible that}} early African Americans inherited this variation from colonial European-Americans, and later kept the variation when it largely passed out of wider usage. Ain't is rarely attested for the present-tense constructions do not or does not.|$|E
5|$|At 7:30am {{the next}} morning, the Duke of Wellington {{wrote to the}} Mayor of Liverpool from his lodgings in nearby Roby. He had <b>been</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> receive the Freedom of the City, but felt that under the {{circumstances}} any kind of celebration would be inappropriate, {{and said that he}} would not be attending any of the planned events in the city that day. The planned parades and ceremonial dinner were cancelled, but in the absence of rapid transit or mass communication there was no way to notify most of the city's population. While some shops had heard the news and remained shuttered, the ships in Liverpool's docks remained festooned with brightly coloured streamers, and sounded their horns at the time the Duke was expected to be passing.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{travelled}} from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, {{accompanied by}} a large group including family members and followers. During the trip, he was treated with respect in the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, he {{was treated as a}} government guest. Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited him to come to Constantinople, is unclear. The reason may have been political because Bahá'u'lláh was viewed as a person of influence. After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for Adrianople. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with Bahá'u'lláh's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities.|$|E
5|$|Berhtwald's {{period as}} {{archbishop}} {{coincided with the}} end of Wilfrid's long struggle to regain the Bishopric of York, and the two-year delay between Theodore's death and Berhtwald's election may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> efforts to select Wilfrid for Canterbury. After his election, Berhtwald went to Gaul for consecration and then presided over two councils that attempted to settle the Wilfrid issue, finally succeeding at the second council in 705. Berhtwald also was the recipient of the first surviving letter close in Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Choughs can be locally {{threatened}} by the accumulation of pesticides and heavy metals in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from global warming, which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely. Fossils of both chough species {{were found in the}} mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> climate change or human activity.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being more}} popular than some men's {{football}} events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd), women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, {{on the grounds that}} the game (as played by women) was distasteful. Some speculated that this may have also <b>been</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted. This led to the formation of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.|$|E
5|$|Donna Lee Brien {{stated that}} just as the filmmakers {{attempted}} {{to distance themselves from}} Leigh's murder, the city of Newcastle attempted to distance itself from Blackrock. A 1999 feature in The Sydney Morning Herald discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned everything from Mel Gibson's 1977 debut film Summer City to a short film festival that year, but made no mention of Blackrock. Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> public frustration with the legal system, as the film achieves justice for the victim, whereas no one was ever convicted of raping Leigh. Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and care must be taken when fictionalising an actual crime.|$|E
5|$|Former Germany manager Berti Vogts was {{appointed}} Scotland manager in January 2002. A {{number of players}} retired from international football after Craig Brown resigned, which meant that Vogts had {{to build a new}} squad. He tried new players and formations, but the team suffered a number of heavy defeats in early friendly fixtures. Scotland reached the UEFA Euro 2004 qualification play-offs and won the first leg at home against the Netherlands, but were then beaten 6–0 in the return match. Vogts continued as manager into the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification matches, but resigned after the team took just two points from their first three matches. Debate about why Vogts had failed centred on whether Scotland had sufficient playing talent to compete, or if poor results had <b>been</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> his own failings.|$|E

5|$|Gaddafi {{was ready}} now for an {{offensive}}. The decisive offensive began in June, when a 3,000-strong GUNT force invested Faya-Largeau, the main government stronghold in the North, which fell on 25 June. The GUNT force rapidly proceeded towards Koro Toro, Oum Chalouba and Abéché, assuming {{control of the}} main routes towards N'Djamena. Libya, while helping with recruiting, training, and providing the GUNT with heavy artillery, only committed a few thousand regular troops to the offensive, {{and most of these}} were artillery and logistic units. This may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> Gaddafi's desire that the conflict be read as a Chadian internal affair.|$|E
5|$|In 1857, Rodin {{submitted}} a clay {{model of a}} companion to the École des Beaux-Arts {{in an attempt to}} win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied. Given that entrance requirements at the Grande École were not particularly high, the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin's inability to gain entrance may have <b>been</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the judges' Neoclassical tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. Leaving the Petite École in 1857, Rodin earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects and architectural embellishments.|$|E
