25|$|In 1973, the city's {{graffiti}} epidemic surged {{to levels}} never seen before; nearly every subway car was tagged with graffiti {{by the end}} of the year. It was aided by the budgetary restraints on New York City, which limited its ability to remove graffiti and perform transit maintenance. Mayor John Lindsay declared the first war on graffiti in 1972, but it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> the city was able and willing to dedicate enough resources to that problem to start impacting the growing subculture. The MTA tried rubbing the graffiti off with an acid solution, but maintaining the cars to keep them relatively graffiti-free was costing them around $1.3 million annually. In winter 1973, the car-washing program was stopped. In September 1974, exterior washing with an acid solution started, but the solution was found to have caused more harm than good.|$|E
2500|$|On September 8, 1995, at UFC 7, Shamrock {{successfully}} {{defended the}} UFC Superfight Championship against UFC 6 Tournament Champion [...] "The Russian Bear" [...] Oleg Taktarov. Shamrock stated {{in his autobiography}} that he was uncomfortable fighting Taktarov, as Oleg trained with the Lion's Den {{and he did not}} wish to injure his friend and teammate. In Beyond the Lion's Den, Shamrock states; [...] "In addition to being his friend, I was also trying to get him into Pancrase and if I broke his leg it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> he could recover and he needed the money. I figured my best chance of winning without seriously hurting him was to beat on him with punches... If I could open a cut and get him to start pouring blood, I could get a referee stoppage. It might not have been the best plan going into a fight, but considering the options it seemed like the best option available. And it turned out fine. I battered him around {{for the duration of the}} match, the bout was declared a draw and when Oleg recovered he went on to fight in Pancrase." ...|$|E

5000|$|Early in {{the course}} I formed a {{one-step}} projective resolution of a module, and remarked that if the kernel was projective in one resolution it was projective in all. I added that, although the statement was so simple and straightforward, it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> we proved it. Steve Schanuel spoke up and told me and the class that it was quite easy, and thereupon sketched {{what has come to}} be known as [...] "Schanuel's lemma." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{growth of}} {{graffiti}} in New York City was helped by its subway system, whose accessibility and interconnectedness facilitated {{the rise of}} a community of subway graffiti writers and muralists. It was also aided by the budgetary restraints on New York City, which limited its ability to remove graffiti and perform transit maintenance. Mayor John Lindsay declared the first war on graffiti in 1972, but it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> the city was able and willing to dedicate enough resources to that problem to start impacting the growing subculture.|$|E

5000|$|Shannon {{was born}} in Tucson, Arizona, {{and moved to the}} Texas Panhandle when he was nine. [...] He grew up mainly in Dumas, Texas, north of Amarillo on Highway 287. Shannon joined his first band, The Avengers, around age 13. The band members were Shannon (guitar), Tim Easley (vocals), Jim Love (guitar) and David Davis (drums). It would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> they {{realized}} the importance of the bass guitar, but eventually Shannon did. Their first gig paid them $80. That excited them so much, they gave half their paycheck back.|$|E
50|$|According to Marvel's Transformers comics, Rumble and Frenzy are brothers. Rumble {{was one of}} the Decepticons that {{originally}} attacked the Ark and subsequently crashed to Earth. Reconfigured into the Earth mode of a microcassette, he participated in many of the early battles against the Autobots (even being defeated by a robo-suited Buster Witwicky {{at one point in the}} U.K. comics). Unfortunately, he accompanied Megatron in his raid against the Autobot base, summarily getting deactivated by Omega Supreme along with Starscream, Skywarp, Thundercracker, Frenzy and Buzzsaw.

50|$|In 1832 Ingram {{established}} his own printing and newsagents business in Nottingham, {{in partnership with}} his brother-in-law, Nathaniel Cooke. As a newsagent he noticed that when newspapers included woodcuts, their sales increased. He concluded {{that it would be}} possible to make a good profit from a magazine that included a large number of illustrations. However, it was to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> he could put this theory into practice. The newsagent business failed to make much progress until Ingram purchased the rights to a laxative known as Parr's Life Pills. The profits from marketing these pills provided the capital which enabled him to set up and publish The Illustrated London News.|$|E

It may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> the return to the [...] "household name" [...] days of Grant Kenny, Trevor Hendy, Guy Leech and Darren Mercer but has certainly given a new platform to today's young Ironman stars, Shannon and Caine Eckstein, Ky Hurst, Matt Poole, Tannin Lyndon, Ali Day and Kendrick Louis.|$|E
50|$|Alan Buckley {{signed the}} Dutchman for West Bromwich Albion in March 1996 for Â£400,000. Despite Buckley {{claiming}} it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> he made any difference, Sneekes almost immediately became a cult hero at The Hawthorns. Sneekes was an overnight sensation, {{and many of}} the Baggies crowd took to wearing long blond wigs - even the club shop was selling them. Sneekes finished his first season with ten goals from thirteen games, arguably for some Albion fans saving them from relegation. Sneekes spent seven seasons at West Brom before finally being transferred {{at the start of the}} 2001-02 season. After Sneekes' retirement in 2007, he went on to captain West Bromwich Albion in the Midlands 'Masters' and has done so ever since. He scored in the 2008 and 2011 tournaments.|$|E

5000|$|Clarke-Salter {{made his}} debut in a 1-0 defeat on 28 September 2016 away to Sheffield United. On 18 October 2016, Clarke-Salter played his second {{match for the}} Rovers in a 3-3 against Milton Keynes Dons, where he {{provided}} an assist for the second goal to the hat-trick scorer Matt Taylor. On 22 October, Clarke-Salter scored his first goal for the Rovers in a 2-0 win over Oldham Athletic. On 22 November 2016, Clarke-Salter was taken to hospital during the 5-1 loss against Charlton Athletic. After the match, Rovers manager Darrell Clarke, stated that Clarke-Salter a fractured his arm and it will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> he'll be back. Clarke-Salter made his return from the injury in a 2-0 victory over Southend United. He was an 89th minute substitute, replacing man of the match and goalscorer of the second goal, Rory Gaffney. He made his first start since his return from injury in the 1-0 victory over AFC Wimbledon.|$|E
50|$|With Les Sealey and Mark Bosnich gone, Jim Leighton {{almost a}} {{forgotten}} man {{after just one}} appearance the previous season, and Gary Walsh seemingly {{not good enough to}} be first choice goalkeeper, Ferguson paid Â£500,000 for BrÃ¸ndby and Denmark goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel. He now had a squad that few if any clubs in the First Division could match. As well as having established stars like Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister, Bryan Robson and Mark Hughes at his disposal, there was plenty of young talent on the way up at Old Trafford. 20-year-old winger Lee Sharpe's impressive displays in 1990-91 had earned him the PFA Young Player of the Year award, and there was much hype surrounding 17-year-old winger Ryan Giggs, who had made his debut the previous season and scored in only his second senior game. When Giggs turned professional the previous November, he was billed as the next George Best, though it still seemed that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> he would become a first team regular.|$|E
5000|$|On July 15, 2008, 10 {{days after}} losing his belt to Forrest Griffin, Jackson {{was arrested in}} Costa Mesa and booked on {{suspicion}} of felony reckless driving, and felony hit and run after striking several vehicles. He led pursuing officers on a chase while driving {{on the wrong side}} of the street and on city sidewalks in his lifted Ford F-350 with his picture painted on the side. During the chase, one of the tires blew out on his truck and he continued to flee while driving on his rims. On July 18, 2008, UFC President Dana White gave an interview to Yahoo! Sports in which he said that Jackson had initially been detained for a 72-hour stay, but that had been extended. White was quoted as saying: [...] "I think it's going to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>before</b> we get him back." [...] White also claimed that before the detainment, Jackson did not sleep for four days, had not been eating, and had only been drinking energy drinks and became mentally ill from dehydration. According to White, no drugs were found in Jackson's system.|$|E

[...] In a poll run by Hollyoaks official website to discover the best mum out of Martha, Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) and Diane O'Connor (Alex Fletcher), Martha received the least votes, with over 240 votes and only 3% of the total votes. A writer from TV Magazine said that drinking champagne around Martha was not the greatest idea because she [...] "is struggling to stay away from the demon drink".
