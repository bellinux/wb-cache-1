We've never done that before, and honestly I don't {{have a whole lot}} of experience writing love songs, or anyways lyrics that are like this." ...|$|E
500|$|Widney {{attributed}} his longevity {{to living}} simply and keeping busy. At age 94, Widney advocated [...] "no liquor, no tobacco, no drugs. I'm not a fanatic on liquor, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> it is a medicine. I keep {{it around and}} take it when I need it. But {{there is no excuse}} whatever for tobacco or drugs". He recommended at least eight hours sleep each night and short naps throughout the day.|$|E

500|$|... "Until It Beats No More" [...] is {{featured}} as background music in Lopez's commercial for the Fiat 500. The commercial, entitled [...] "My World", depicts Lopez leaving Manhattan and {{making her way}} to The Bronx, her hometown. Lopez is seen {{behind the steering wheel}} of the car, gazing out at the scenery of The Bronx passing by. A voice-over says the words: [...] "Here, this is my world. This place inspires me to be tougher, to stay sharper, to think faster. They may be just streets to you <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> they're a playground." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{studying}} {{the music of}} the Bantu at Cape Town University, MacDermot incorporated African rhythms into the score of Hair. [...] He listened to [...] "what [...] called quaylas... very characteristic beat, very similar to rock. [...] Much deeper though.... Hair is very African – a lot of [...] rhythms, not the tunes so much." [...] Quaylas stress beats on unexpected syllables, and this influence can be heard in songs like [...] "What a Piece of Work Is Man" [...] and [...] "Ain't Got No Grass". [...] MacDermot said, [...] "My idea was to make a total funk show. They said they wanted rock & roll – <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that translated to 'funk.'" [...] That funk is evident throughout the score, notably in songs like [...] "Colored Spade" [...] and [...] "Walking in Space".|$|E
500|$|Officially it {{was called}} a [...] "planned withdrawal" [...] (...). <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{it was so much}} bullshit. The next day, we heard on the radio, in the 'news from the front' (Wehrmachtbericht) about the [...] "successful front correction" [...] in our Yelnya {{defensive}} lines and the enormous losses we inflicted on the enemy. But no single word was heard about a retreat, about the hopelessness of the situation, about the mental and emotional numbness of the German soldiers. In short, it was again a [...] "victory". But we on the front line were running back like rabbits in front of the fox. This metamorphosis of the truth from [...] "all shit" [...] to [...] "it was a victory" [...] baffled me, and those of my comrades who dared to think.|$|E

500|$|Kennet Allott, in {{defending}} against any possible harsh criticism of [...] "Ode to Psyche", {{argues that the}} poem [...] "is the Cinderella of Keats's great odes, {{but it is hard}} to see why it should be so neglected, and at least two poets imply that the conventional treatment of the poem is shabby and undeserved". Allott then cites Bridges and Eliot as views that he sympathizes with, and he believes that the poem [...] "is neither unflawed nor the best of odes, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> it illustrates better than any other Keats's possession of poetic power in conjunction with what was for him an unusual artistic detachment, besides being a remarkable poem in its own right. This may be another way of saying that it is the most architectural of the odes, as it is certainly the one that culminates most dramatically." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} officially {{canceled}} by ABC on May 13, 2010. In {{an interview with}} New York Magazine, Victor Fresco, the show's creator, was asked why he thought the show didn't catch on. He responded, [...] "I think not enough people knew about it. It wasn’t like {{we had a lot}} of people watch it and they didn’t come back to it. If anything, I think we were building slowly, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the way TV works is you spend a lot of money advertising and promoting, or you have to let a show stay some place for a long period of time and an audience slowly comes to it. And I don’t think we got either of that". Fresco also added, [...] "I still feel there’s an audience out there for it, because I know that the people who liked it, liked it a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Boys' Club" [...] {{was written}} by Alan Yang and {{directed}} by Michael McCullers. McCullers co-wrote two of the Austin Powers films and directed Poehler in the comedy film Baby Mama. The cold open scene, with kids throwing bags of dog feces at Leslie, {{was added to the}} episode after the rest had already been filmed, and was directed personally by series co-creator Greg Daniels. The bags were actually filled with mashed potatoes. Daniels said of the opening, [...] "There {{were a lot of people}} who felt this was not in good taste, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> this was one of the most fun things about the show." [...] The restriction prohibiting Pawnee employees from accepting gifts over $25 was based on real-life municipal regulations the Parks and Recreation producers encountered during their research. The scenes filmed in the town hall outside courtyard were filmed on a studio sound stage, and the ethics board review scene was filmed inside the city hall building of Pasadena, California.|$|E

[...] It's going to be as if you're walking into New York circa 1974: There's an art installation in the lobby, a DJ spinning your favorite records in the main room, and then the most haunting performance that you've ever seen on the stage. [...] I'm on the phone every minute of every day, talking to people, being creative, planning this Ball, and my tour manager is constantly saying, 'Come on, we have to go, we've got to go right now,' [...] <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the Ball is so important. I want so much to make every depression dollar that everyone spends on my show worth it. And, yeah, I'm paying a lot for it— out of my own pocket. But that's OK.

500|$|Holmes's {{academic}} {{interests and}} hobbies were divided among law, medicine, and writing. He {{was elected to}} the Hasty Pudding, where he served as Poet and Secretary, and to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. With two friends, he collaborated on a small book entitled Poetical Illustrations of the Athenaeum Gallery of Painting, which was a collection of satirical poems about the new art gallery in Boston. He was asked to provide an original work for his graduating class's commencement and wrote a [...] "light and sarcastic" [...] poem that met with great acclaim. Following graduation, Holmes intended to go into the legal profession, so he lived at home and studied at the Harvard Law School (named Dane School at the time). By January 1830, however, he was disenchanted with legal studies. [...] "I am sick at heart of this place and almost everything connected to it", he wrote. [...] "I know not what the temple of law may be to those who have entered it, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> it seems very cold and cheerless about the threshold." ...|$|E
500|$|Christman {{contacted}} the Scientology critics based in Clearwater, and arranged flight transportation to Florida. She {{arrived at the}} airport in California to find that her flight was cancelled. Her former supervisor, Janet Weiland, was waiting for her close to the ticket counter, and tried to convince her to remain in the organization. Christman eventually got on a flight to Tampa, Florida, but was met at the gate when she arrived by agents of Scientology. Tampa police were notified, and escorted Christman safely away from the Scientologists. While a member of Scientology, Christman had given over $1 million to the organization; she used her inheritance money to pay for coursework. She commented to the St. Petersburg Times of Florida about the thought process she underwent after leaving the organization, [...] "When you get out and you get the whole thing, you're like, 'What was I thinking?'. I know the people inside are brainwashed and they're laughing at me. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the truth is, I'm free. I can do what I want. I can say what I want." ...|$|E

According to People, [...] "Call it a finger malfunction? Madonna {{was supposed to be the}} center of attention during the Super Bowl halftime show Sunday, but the Queen of Pop was upstaged by her collaborator M.I.A., who flipped off the camera at one point during the performance, prompting swift apologies from the NFL and NBC." [...] Madonna expressed her disappointment in an interview with host Ryan Seacrest on his talk show, On Air with Ryan Seacrest. She said that it was a [...] "teenager ... irrelevant thing" [...] for M.I.A. to do, and was [...] "out of place" [...] in the show: [...] "I was really surprised. I didn't know anything about it. I wasn't happy about it. I understand it's punk rock and everything, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> there was such a feeling of love and good energy and positivity; it seemed negative." ...|$|E
500|$|On 27 December, French sources {{revealed}} that Manchester United {{was interested in}} signing Evra. Despite rumours of Monaco reaching a transfer agreement with Internazionale, on 3 January 2006, Evra revealed he preferred to move to England to join Manchester United. The following day, Manchester United officially issued a transfer bid for the player. On 6 January, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed a deal for Evra was reached. Four days later, the transfer was official as Evra joined the club for a transfer fee of around £5.5million and signed a three-and-a-half-year contract. Evra's arrival signalled Ferguson's intention {{to shore up the}} club's defence that had suffered since the sidelining of Gabriel Heinze. After joining the club, Evra affirmed that Manchester was his only future destination: [...] "I was not very keen to go forward in the talks with Arsenal, Liverpool or Real Madrid. They all talked with my agent in the past two seasons. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> it was over. As I said to the Monaco officials, I only wanted to hear about Manchester." ...|$|E
500|$|British-Tamil {{recording}} artist M.I.A. {{was one of}} the songwriters of [...] "Elastic Love". According to her, [...] "Elastic Love" [...] was the first track that she recorded, even before she started working on her debut album. She added, [...] "It's the one I made in-between taking time out and having a baby and starting mine". When was asked about why she agreed to work with Aguilera, M.I.A. revealed, [...] "Other people were involved who I respect like Peaches and it was like a sea of women coming together to write this new thing. Christina had also had a baby, you know, so it was kind of an interesting situation". Aguilera's decision not to perform her [...] "trademark warbling" [...] while recording the song disappointed M.I.A., as she detailed in an interview with MTV News UK:I really thought I {{was going to be able}} to go in there and get her vocals on to the next level and she didn't want to do it. She was like 'You might think that's great because it's not what you do, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I'm really bored of it'. It's interesting getting to work with people who can do things vocally that you can't... but yeah I only heard the song for the first time when everyone else did.|$|E

500|$|A fourth {{team was}} {{introduced}} to the World Series Cup in 1994–95—Australia A—for the only time. The Australian selectors re-shuffled both teams so that some players stepped up from the A team to the main Australian team, and vice versa, during the competition, depending on their performance. The Australian captain Mark Taylor was not a fan of the innovation: [...] "... out there, on the field there was an ultra-competitive attitude by blokes of both teams, spurred on by the crows who were barracking for against Australia and supporting the underdog Australia A, who were pepped up and firing. Of course it gave the Australia A guys a chance to break into the Australian team, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the focus of the summer was on beating the Poms [...] in the Tests and winning the World Series, not beating our own Australian mates." [...] Despite the negative feedback, the concept gave Ponting a chance on the international stage, and he scored 161 runs at 26.83 with one half-century. Two weeks after the World Series, Ponting was selected in the squad for the upcoming one-day tri-series involving South Africa, India and hosts New Zealand. Trent Bouts, a cricket writer for The Australian said: [...] "His selection at age 20 would normally represent a bold gamble on youth but so precocious are his talents it amounts to a routine progression." [...] Ponting made his ODI debut against South Africa at the Basin Reserve in Wellington on 15 February 1995.|$|E
500|$|Irish-American actor Brian Donlevy {{was brought}} in by Robert L. Lippert to play the title role of Quatermass to provide an {{interest}} for American audiences. Donlevy, in his own words, specialised in [...] "he-men roles – rough, tough and realistic". Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Beau Geste (1939), he was also known for his appearances in The Great McGinty (1940) and The Glass Key (1942). At the time he appeared as Quatermass his career was in decline, however. Donlevy's no-nonsense portrayal of Quatermass {{is very different from}} that of Reginald Tate in the television version and was not to Nigel Kneale's liking, who said, [...] "I may have picked Quatermass's surname out of a phone book, but his first name was carefully chosen: Bernard, after Bernard Lovell, the creator of Jodrell Bank. Pioneer, ultimate questing man. Donlevy played him as a mechanic, a creature with a completely closed mind”. Responding to Kneale's criticisms, Val Guest said, [...] "Nigel Kneale was expecting to find Quatermass like he was on television, a sensitive British scientist, not some American stomping around, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> Donlevy gave it absolute reality". By this stage in his career, Donlevy was suffering from alcoholism; it was some weeks into the shoot before Guest became aware that the flask of coffee he always carried on set was laced with brandy. Guest found, however, that [...] "Brian was all right, no problem at all once you kept him sober". He reprised the role of Quatermass in Quatermass 2 (1957) but was replaced by Andrew Keir in the third film, Quatermass and the Pit (1967).|$|E
