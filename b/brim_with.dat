[...] Dave Walker from The Times-Picayune complimented Gaga's vocals, likening them to that of singer Liza Minnelli. CNET's Ty Pendlebury was present during the recording of the special and remarked that [...] "without the autotune and other electronic fiddling, Lady Gaga can really sing", but found Bennett's voice to be [...] "bit croaky" [...] sometimes. He also noticed that the whole concert was especially filmed for television, without any audience interraction and [...] "dead silences in between songs." ...|$|E

500|$|Music critic Green Baron {{reviewed}} {{the music for}} Sputnikmusic, and said: [...] "Dallas Buyers Club itself was a breathtaking motion picture driven by the extraordinary performances from Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. Its accompanying soundtrack, however, is less than satisfying. Filled to the <b>brim</b> <b>with</b> lifeless, stale indie-rock tracks, the supporting album {{to one of the}} year's most gripping films is a complete waste of talent and potential." [...] Baron thought that Dallas Buyers Club was saved by a few excellent songs, which were [...] "Ready to Be Called On", [...] "After the Scripture", and [...] "City of Angels". He said that, [...] "Overall, the Dallas Buyers Club soundtrack is one that really isn't worth your time or money. Aside from three superb songs, the whole album is a collection of drab indie pop/rock that ultimately falls flat due to its lack of memorability." ...|$|E
500|$|While lamenting that Songs by George Harrison was [...] "an heirloom-quality item (with a {{price to}} match)", and so {{prohibitive}} {{to the majority of}} Harrison's audience, author Robert Rodriguez considers that Warner Bros. [...] "displayed appalling judgment" [...] in overlooking [...] "Sat Singing" [...] and particularly [...] "Flying Hour", which he describes as [...] "a breezy tune filled to the <b>brim</b> <b>with</b> hooks". Simon Leng admires the reinterpretation of [...] "For You Blue" [...] as a rhythm and blues [...] "jam track" [...] and praises [...] "Sat Singing" [...] for its [...] "melody of some beauty, colored by warm, golden slide guitar". Leng adds that [...] "As a musical essay on serenity and joy, [...] is one of Harrison's best", yet he also identifies an isolationist perspective on the three 1980 recordings that reflected the singer's failure to appreciate the market forces with which Warner's had to contend.|$|E
500|$|Soul Food Taqueria {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics. Exclaim! editor Noel Dix observed {{an improvement in}} production and complexity of instrumentation by Guerrero from his earlier work, and stated, [...] "This record pours so much heart and emotion into it that you’re bound to feel its warmth and splendor while it’s bumping in your walkman as you trek the city streets." [...] Noting that A Little Bit of Somethin was criticized as a [...] "lifeless piece of pop-trip-hop", Brian Ho of Dusted praised Guerrero's artistic growth and found [...] "everything" [...] to be [...] "an improvement over its predecssor", writing that the album [...] "is filled to the <b>brim</b> <b>with</b> body and life {{in a way that}} few albums can claim". XLR8R critic Liz Cordingley called the album a [...] "nice case of dubby, electric guitar-driven downtempo", and called its music [...] "dusty lo-fi soul that is seductively languid". Joe Warminsky of the Washington City Paper praised Guerrero's minimalist approach to the album's chill-out sound, as the chill-out music genre mostly features implementation of a slicker production. He also compared the lo-fi grooves of Soul Food Taqueria to [...] "Shuggie Otis with Baja roots". Carmen Johnson of Prefix Mag called it a [...] "stellar follow-up to 2000's A Little Bit of Somethin", and commended Guerrero for producing [...] "his own organic, subterranean blend of bohemian blues, hip-hop and salsa that's creative and adventurous". Johnson called it [...] "the perfect soundtrack for the lazy days that hearken back to the end of summer." ...|$|E

500|$|Mileena was {{described}} by Computer and Video Games as [...] "equally erotic and repulsive". According to IGN, [...] "at first blush she seems like your quintessential sultry video-game vixen, but the mask comes off and she's got a gaping mouth filled to the <b>brim</b> <b>with</b> dagger-like teeth." [...] In 2008, IGN's Scott Collura listed [...] "Mileen-ewwwwww" [...] as one of [...] "top 50 chicks behaving badly," [...] while GamesRadar included her {{on the list of}} [...] "gaming's most repellent anti-babes". Comparing the Mortal Kombat characters to the seven deadly sins in Dante's Inferno, Chris Holt of GamePro chose Mileena to represent Envy. Aaron Koehn of GamePro placed Mileena and Kitana eleventh on his 2009 list of the best palette-swapped video game characters, but wrote that [...] "if you gauge Mileena's attractiveness simply based on the size of her baby-feeders, be ready for some disappointment when she removes her mask." [...] ScrewAttack ranked her as seventh on their list of the top ten [...] "ugly chicks in games" [...] for her horrific looks when unmasked, but otherwise calling her [...] "the ultimate woman." [...] Virgin Media included her on their list of the ten [...] "game girls you wouldn't dare to date" [...] for being attractive [...] "until she rips off her veil and reveals her monstrous form beneath." [...] Destructoid's Nick Chester commented: [...] "Her story, as far as I'm concerned, is that she needs to see a dentist." [...] On the other hand, EGMs Eric L. Patterson, stating his preference of Mileena over Kitana, wrote that Mileena's face is actually {{one of the reasons why}} he likes her. Reviewing the Vita version of MK2011, GamesRadar's Jack DeVries called it [...] "as pretty as Mileena minus mask, but overall, just as viciously fun." [...] Ranking Mileena as second on his 2013 list of ugliest video game characters, Alex Langley of Arcade Sushi wrote: [...] "If ever there were a time to use the term 'butterface' it would be with Mileena, because everything about her is hot...but her face. Her face will friggin' bite your face off, which is never a sign of a good date." [...] Ramon Hagenbeuk of Dutch XGN included Mileena among the [...] "top 10 ugly game chicks" [...] in 2015 due to her face despite [...] "her nice figure". French magazine Retropolis placed Mileena second in a 2013 ranking of the sexiest girls in fighting games in which her bust was the criteria for her [...] "reverse décolleté" [...] approach to fashion after Mortal Kombat II, while comparing the character to shrimp in regards to her physical appearance: [...] "Everything is good except for the head." [...] Playboy included Mileena, Kitana, and Jade together in their list of [...] "the hottest video game breasts of all time" [...] at 19th place.|$|E
2500|$|The Liberal {{historian}} Lord Acton read Macaulay's History of England {{four times}} and later described himself as [...] "a raw English schoolboy, primed to the <b>brim</b> <b>with</b> Whig politics" [...] but [...] "not Whiggism only, but Macaulay in particular that I was so full of." [...] However, after coming under German influence Acton would later find fault in Macaulay. In 1880 Acton classed Macaulay (with Burke and Gladstone) as one [...] "of the three greatest Liberals".

"This Wheel's On Fire" [...] {{closes the}} album [...] "at {{a peak of}} {{sinister}} mystery", according to Gill, who suggests that it brings the record back to the motorcycle crash that created the circumstances for The Basement Tapes: [...] "It is virtually impossible not to see the locked wheel of Dylan's Triumph 500 in the title, the very wheel upon which his own accelerating pursuit of disaster was borne so swiftly, and then arrested so abruptly. The verses <b>brim</b> <b>with</b> unfinished business, anchored by the certainty that 'we shall meet again'." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the town's public house, Plog—jealous and wounded—is {{looking for}} Lisa. Both Jof and the {{manipulative}} Raval are also present: {{for the sake}} of mischief, Raval tells Plog that Jof knows what Lisa is doing. Raval manipulates Plog and the other customers into intimidating Jof, and forces Jof to dance on the tables like a bear. The bullying is broken up by the appearance of Jöns, who once again recognises Raval: true to his word, he slashes and permanently scars the theologian's face. Both knight and squire are reacquainted with Jof's family, with a repentant Plog also joining them. The knight enjoys a country picnic of milk and wild strawberries gathered by Mia. The knight says: [...] "I'll carry this memory between my hands {{as if it were a}} bowl filled to the <b>brim</b> <b>with</b> fresh milk...And it will be an adequate sign—it will be enough for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a mixed review, Slant Magazines William McBee found The Blueprint 3 [...] "predictable", [...] "complacent", and [...] "a hip-hop feast, for sure, {{filled to}} the <b>brim</b> <b>with</b> elite {{production}} and elite rapping, but it lacks the hungriness, the spirit, and the craziness that marks a classic album". Rolling Stones Jody Rosen called it [...] "a catchy, pop-friendly record", but viewed that it lacks the [...] "electric charge" [...] of Jay-Z's previous albums {{and that he is}} [...] "stuck for a subject [...] But he says it well". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that it [...] "peters out in a mass of indistinct tracks" [...] following its first four songs. The Sunday Times criticized the music's [...] "insistent straining for a crossover, pop-coloured sheen", writing that it [...] "mires much of the album in insipidness, coating stale braggadocio (without, mostly, any compensating humour)." [...] Pitchforks Ian Cohen commented that it is [...] "so certainly Jay-Z's weakest solo album, you'll be tempted to wonder if Kingdom Come was somehow underrated". Greg Kot of the Los Angeles Times gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars and viewed Jay-Z's celebrity and older age as somewhat of a flaw, stating: ...|$|E

2500|$|The album {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Tijana Ilich, {{writing for}} About.com, put Sentimiento at {{number one on}} her list of the Top Reggaetón/Hip Hop Albums of 2007. [...] "Instead of selling the music with skull-crunching decibels, she uses her strong, rich, deep voice to bring {{every bit as much}} force to her songs. Her lyrics are about honest emotions that <b>brim</b> <b>with</b> real life situations." [...] she commented. Ilich found the album interesting [...] "in its turnaround technique of using male guests to sing any song that even smacks of a ballad." [...] She said it was interesting to see what Queen would be singing about in 2007. She later named Queen one of the ten most influential women in Latin music in the category Reggaetón/Hip-Hop while selecting Sentimiento as Queen's best album, yet. David Jeffies of Allmusic, began his review of the album by noting that with Sentimiento, {{it was the first time}} she entered the Billboard 200, [...] "affirming her considerable popularity, especially in her native land." [...] He claimed that Queen's husky voice [...] "is well-suited to reggaetón's catchy melodies and hard-hitting beats, as evinced on the frenetic lead single [...] "Que Lloren." [...] According to Nelly Apaza of the Houston Chronicle, the album is pure emotions. She opinionated that Queen had never named a previous album so perfectly.|$|E
