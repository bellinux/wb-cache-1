Bissonnette wrote that the helicopter approach and landing matched the official version. According to Bissonnette, when bin Laden peered out at the Americans advancing on his third-floor room, the SEAL who fired upon him hit him {{on the right side of}} the head. Bin Laden stumbled into his bedroom, where the SEALs found him crumpled and twitching on the floor in a pool of <b>body</b> <b>matter,</b> with two women crying over his body. The other SEALs allegedly grabbed the women, moved them away, and shot bin Laden repeatedly in the chest until he was dead. According to Bissonnette, the weapons in the room—an AK-47 rifle and a Makarov pistol—were unloaded.|$|E

50|$|The 'body matter' is {{the group}} of pages that contain {{the body of the}} text of the book. The front matter comes before it, {{containing}} title pages, content lists, publisher's metadata etc. It is followed by the back matter, which includes appendices, references, credits, colophon etc. The distinction between the parts, body and other, is that the <b>body</b> <b>matter</b> is produced by the author, the front and back matter by the publisher (through the book designer, index collator etc.). Where there is a prose introduction, it demonstrates this; an introduction by the author is considered as <b>body</b> <b>matter,</b> an introduction by an editor or other commentator is placed with the front matter. In some technical publications, appendices are so long and important as part of the book that they are a creative endeavour of the author, rather than a mere collation exercise by the publisher. In this case they may, like the introduction, be considered {{as a part of the}} <b>body</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|E
50|$|At one time, {{books were}} {{produced}} as 'letter-books', {{where the body}} of text consisted of chapters of solid text, unillustrated. Where illustrations were provided, these were costly and so plates were inserted in sections, either {{at the end of}} the <b>body</b> <b>matter,</b> or grouped within the signatures. Development in printing in the early 20th century, and particularly developments in newspaper design and the incorporation of photographs, encouraged the development of the 'picture-book' where images were mixed in the text and formed part of the <b>body</b> <b>matter</b> itself (although in most cases, this was still outside the paragraphs of the typesetter's body text).|$|E

40|$|This work is {{licensed}} under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3. 0 Unported LicenseA discursive {{approach to}} knowledge contends that language is the constitutive force {{of experience and}} lived reality. Meaning is created through language use within relationships, while discourses function as the statements that produce knowledge, power and truth claims. We cannot step outside of the discourses through which our knowledge of experience is produced, though their complexity always allows us to resist particular identities that are discursively available to us. Based on interviews with 12 adoptees constituted within the ‘closed’ adoption period between 1955 and 1985, this narrative analysis represents {{the way in which}} the adoptive <b>body</b> <b>matters</b> to participants’ experiences of adoption and their resistances to the discourses that produce knowledge of adoption: Embodiment needed to be incorporated into this discursive work. Knowing, accessing and beingin- the-world are achieved through our senses in everyday life. We engage and shape cultural norms that enable and constrain corporeality. The adoptive experience is lived and felt through bodies that struggle to articulate their corporeality through discourse. Without discourses fit for purpose, speaking embodiment in and through adoption is precarious and adoptees attempt to articulate subjectivities beyond those allowed. This paper discusses the strategies used to materialise <b>body</b> <b>matters</b> in researching adoption...|$|R
