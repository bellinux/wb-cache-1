It is shown that the lifetime during discontinuous testing (166 h at 1000 degrees C hot dwell time) the system with Zr modified <b>bondcoat</b> outperformed the conventional system {{by a factor of}} four, while during cyclic temperature exposure (dwell time 2 h) only a minor lifetime improvement was found. The results could be rationalized in terms of differences in the microstructure and associated failure mechanisms of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) formed on the two bondcoats. In the system with the conventional <b>bondcoat</b> a flat, dense TGO formed and delaminations classically propagated at the TGO/bondcoat interface. Therefore the TBC-lifetime could be related to a critical TGO thickness and appeared to be insensitive to the change of the cyclic parameters. In contrast with Zr-modified <b>bondcoat</b> heterogeneous, rapidly inward growing TGOs with zirconia precipitates formed, whereby the failure path was shifted to the TBC/TGO interface. For the latter TBC system the lifetime is mainly determined by the number of temperature cyclic events. By reducing the Zr reservoir in the <b>bondcoat,</b> however, the cyclic lifetime can be significantly increased. This lifetime extension compared to the Zr-free NiCoCrAlY <b>bondcoat</b> requires an exact control of the Zr content the BC thickness and the <b>bondcoat</b> processing parameters.

40|$|In {{the present}} work it is {{shown that the}} {{lifetime}} of air plasma sprayed thermal barrier coatings systems with high velocity oxyfuel bondcoats can be substantially extended by application of a thin air plasma sprayed “flashcoat” layer onto the base, high velocity oxyfuel <b>bondcoat.</b> This approach allows improvement of the <b>bondcoat</b> roughness profile to the extent typically obtained by optimized vacuum plasma spraying.

40|$|The prime design {{considerations}} for modern nickel based superalloys {{for use in}} aero gas-turbine engines, are those of mechanical performance, namely good resistance to creep and fatigue with good toughness and microstructural phase stability. Design of {{the current generation of}} superalloys has attained these properties at the expense of environmental resistance. This design philosophy has lead to the widespread use of surface coatings technology to protect hot-section componentry from the harsh operating environment. The ongoing drive towards higher operating temperatures has lead to an interest, over the last few years, in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). TBCs are duplex coating systems consisting of a thin, insulating, ceramic layer over a metallic <b>bondcoat.</b> The <b>bondcoat</b> provides both environmental protection and the necessary adhesive interface to maintain the adherence of the ceramic during the rigours of operation. Central to the performance of a TBC system is the integrity and adherence of the alumina scale promoted by the <b>bondcoat.</b> This study aimed to design and optimise a novel <b>bondcoat</b> system that was capable of out-performing the current generation of bondcoats and progress the resultant coating into a production ready status. This was achieved by comparing the performance of a range of bondcoats of both novel and standard compositions, using the modified scratch test in conjunction with hot isothermal and cyclic furnace tests.

40|$|Abstract. EB-PVD TBC with {{conventional}} MCrAlY bondcoats was widely used within the high temperature environments.

The crack propagation {{in the case of the}} Zr-doped NiCoCrAlY <b>bondcoat</b> at the TGO/bondcoat interface was hindered due to the inhomogeneous TGO morphology.

Furthermore, Suspension Plasma Spraying (SPS) is a new method to process submicron-sized feedstock powders which are not sufficiently flowable to feed them in dry state.

40|$|Polymer matrix {{composites}} (PMCs) {{are increasingly}} used in aerospace and automotive applications {{because of their}} light weight and high strength-to-weight ratio relative to metals. However, a major drawback of PMCs is poor abrasion resistance, which restricts their use, especially at high temperatures. Simply applying a hard coating on PMCs to improve abrasion and erosion resistance is not effective since coating durability is short lived (ref. 1). Generally, PMCs have higher coefficients of thermal expansion than metallic or ceramic coatings have, and coating adhesion suffers because of poor interfacial adhesion strength. One technique commonly used to improve coating adhesion or durability {{is the use of}} bond coats that are interleaved between a coating and a substrate with vastly different coefficients of thermal expansion. An example of this remedy is the use of <b>bondcoats</b> for ceramic thermal barrier coatings on metallic turbine components (ref. 2). Prior collaborative research between the NASA Glenn Research Center and the Allison Advanced Development Company (AADC) demonstrated that bond coats sandwiched between PMCs and high-quality plasma-sprayed, erosion-resistant coatings substantially improved the erosion resistance of PMCs (ref. 3). One unresolved problem in this earlier collaboration was that there was no easy, accurate way to measure the coating erosion wear scar. Coating wear was determined by both profilometry and optical microscopy. Both techniques are time consuming. Wear measurement by optical microscopy requires sample destruction and does not provide a comprehensive measure of the entire wear volume. An even more subtle, yet critical, problem is that these erosion coatings contain two or more materials with different densities. Therefore, simply measuring specimen mass loss before and after erosion will not provide an accurate gauge for coating and/or substrate volume loss. By using a noncontact technique called scanning optical interferometry, which was recently developed at Glenn, researchers can accurately determine the wear performance of erosion-coated PMCs while preserving the sample. An example of this interferometry technique is shown in the preceding figure for an erosion-coated inlet guide vane from a Rolls Royce AE 3007 regional gas turbine jet engine. Erosion was conducted with coated and uncoated PMC vanes, with the abrasive material moving at a velocity of 229 m/s at impingement angles of 20 and 90 degrees. The coatings for PMCs remarkably reduced the erosion volume loss by a factor of approximately 10. Currently, several erosion coatings for PMCs are being compared and downselected for engine testing at Rolls Royce...|$|R

40|$|An {{optimized}} carburization {{treatment has}} been developed to mitigate instabilities that form in the microstructures of advanced turbine airfoil materials. Current turbine airfoils consist of a single crystal superalloy base that provides the mechanical performance of the airfoil, a thermal barrier coating (TBC) that reduces {{the temperature of the}} base superalloy, and a <b>bondcoat</b> between the superalloy and the TBC, that improves the oxidation and corrosion resistance of the base superalloy and the spallation resistance of the TBC. Advanced nickel-base superalloys containing high levels of refractory metals have been observed to develop an instability called secondary reaction zone (SRZ), which can form beneath diffusion aluminide bondcoats.

40|$|The High-Speed Research (HSR) Airfoil Alloy program {{developed}} fourth-generation single-crystal superalloys {{with up to}} an 85 F {{increase in}} creep rupture capability over current production airfoil alloys. Recent results have been generated at the NASA Glenn Research Center on these fourth-generation alloys, but in coated form, for subsonic turbine blade applications under NASA's Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology (UEET) Program. One goal for UEET is to optimize the airfoil alloy/thermal barrier coating system for 3100 F turbine inlet temperatures. The state-of-the art turbine blade airfoil system consists of a superalloy single crystal that provides the basic mechanical performance of the airfoil. A thermal barrier coating is used to reduce {{the temperature of the}} base superalloy, and a <b>bondcoat</b> is deposited between the base material and the thermal barrier coating. The <b>bondcoat</b> improves the oxidation and corrosion resistance of the base superalloy and improves the spallation resistance of the thermal barrier coating. A commercial platinum aluminide <b>bondcoat</b> was applied to the HSR-developed alloys, and a diffusion zone developed as a result of interaction between the <b>bondcoat</b> and the superalloy. Optimized strength is obtained for superalloys when the refractory element content is high and the limits of microstructural stability are approached or exceeded slightly. For fourthgeneration alloys, instability leads to the formation of topologically close packed (TCP) phases, which form internally in the superalloy, and a secondary reaction zone (SRZ), which forms under the diffusion zone. There was a concern that excessive quantities of either TCP or SRZ might decrease the mechanical properties of the superalloy, with SRZ thought to be particularly detrimental and its formation unpredictable. Thus, an SRZreduction effort was initiated in the NASA UEET Program so that methods developed during the HSR project could be optimized further to reduce or eliminate the SRZ. An SRZ is a three-phase constituent composed of TCP and stringers of gamma phase in a matrix of gamma prime. An incoherent grain boundary separates the SRZ from the gammagamma prime microstructure of the superalloy. The SRZ is believed to form as a result of local chemistry changes in the superalloy due to the application of the diffusion aluminide <b>bondcoat.</b> Locally high surface stresses also appear to promote the formation of the SRZ. Thus, techniques that change the local alloy chemistry or reduce surface stresses have been examined for their effectiveness in reducing SRZ. These SRZ-reduction steps are performed on the test specimen or the turbine blade before the <b>bondcoat</b> is applied. Stressrelief heat treatments developed at NASA Glenn have been demonstrated to reduce significantly the amount of SRZ that develops during subsequent high-temperature exposures. Stress-relief heat treatments reduce surface stresses by recrystallizing a thin surface layer of the superalloy. However, in alloys with very high propensities to form SRZ, stress relief heat treatments alone do not eliminate SRZ entirely. Thus, techniques that modify the local chemistry under the <b>bondcoat</b> have been emphasized and optimized successfully at Glenn. One such technique is carburization, which changes the local chemistry by forming submicron carbides near the surface of the superalloy. Detailed characterizations have demonstrated that the depth and uniform distribution of these carbides are enhanced when a stress relief treatment and an appropriate surface preparation are employed in advance of the carburization treatment. Even in alloys that have the propensity to develop a continuous SRZ layer beneath the diffusion zone, the SRZ has been completely eliminated or reduced to low, manageable levels when this combination of techniques is utilized. Now that the techniques to mitigate SRZ have been established at Glenn, TCP phase formation is being emphasized in ongoing work under the UEET Program. The limitsf stability of the fourth-generation alloys with respect to TCP phase formation are currently being defined along with high-temperature creep rupture properties. In addition, a regression model is being developed at Glenn for the prediction of the presence of TCP phase in the microstructure and SRZ under the diffusion zone. The model is based on a design-of-experiments methodology with emphasis on the potential synergistic effects of alloying elements...|$|E

40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{behavior of}} the bond coat {{is an important factor}} determining the lifetime of thermal barrier coatings (TBC) in the advanced gas turbine components. In the present work, the effect of various testing parameters, such as hot/cold dwell time, heating/cooling rate, atmosphere composition on the <b>bondcoat</b> oxidation and associated TBC lifetime has been investigated. The range of coating systems included Electron Beam - Physical Vapor Deposited (EB-PVD) and Air Plasma Sprayed (APS) TBC´s with MCrAlY (M = Ni, Co) and NiPtAl- bondcoats of various compositions. The effect of the testing parameters strongly depended on the type and properties of the studied system. The lifetime of EB-PVD TBC systems with conventional MCrAlY and NiPtAl bondcoats forming uniform, flat alumina scales was found to be limited by critical scale thickness, upon which a rapid crack propagation at the scale/bondcoat interface results in macroscopic failure. The lifetime of such systems was found to be affected by factors, which influence the scale growth rate and adherence (in particular by oxygen partial pressure (pO 2) and water vapor content in the test gas in the case of MCrAlY), whereas the temperature cyclic frequency showed no significant effect. NiPtAl bondcoats showed a superior behavior than the conventional MCrAlY-bondcoats due to slower scale growth rate and better scale adherence. For EB-PVD TBC systems with Zr-doped MCrAlY-bondcoats the lifetime is mainly determined by the crack growth rate in the inhomogeneous inwardly growing oxide scales, whereas the lifetime is not dependent on the pO 2 but rather on the cyclic frequency. For APS TBC systems the <b>bondcoat</b> oxidation is only one of several factors determining the ceramic topcoat lifetime. Therefore the oxide scale adherence is of less importance for lifetime of APS TBCs as compared to EB-PVD TBCs. For the former systems, the cracks initiated at the convex asperities of the rough oxide scale / <b>bondcoat</b> interface need to propagate through the TBC to cause macroscopic failure. The rate of crack propagation in the TBC is a critical step, which depends substantially on its microstructural properties. In addition to the TBC-porosity the <b>bondcoat</b> roughness profile is shown to be an important parameter, which to a large extent determines the rate of crack initiation and propagation. Higher Co-content in the <b>bondcoat</b> was found to stabilize its microstructure thereby lowering the CTE-mismatch stress in the ceramic topcoat thus extending the TBC-lifetime. The major drawback of high Co-contents was that such bondcoats are prone to form fast-growing spinel oxides. This effect, which was especially pronounced on rough surfaces could be suppressed by only a minor (few microns) enrichment of Al on the <b>bondcoat</b> surface prior to TBC-deposition produced by heat-treatment in high vacuum. With respect to the effects of experimental parameters it was found that contrary to EB-PVD TBC systems a higher cycle frequency leads to shortening of the APS TBC lifetime, whereas higher water vapor content had no significant influence. The results of the present work indicate that the lifetime of the TBC systems with MCrAlY bondcoats would be shorter than that required for long-term operation (25 000 hours) at the envisaged operating temperature of 1000 °C. Under such circumstances using NiPtAl-type of bondcoats or perhaps Pt-modified MCrAlY-bondcoats would be an option to obtain the necessary lifetime extension, which can even justify the high cost of metallic Pt...|$|E

40|$|A {{thermally}} grown oxide (TGO) {{such as the}} alumina scale {{formed on}} a <b>bondcoat</b> enhances the oxidation and corrosion resistance of thermal barrier coating (TBC) - bondcoat-superalloy substrate systems. As the external alumina scale lies between the thermal barrier coating and <b>bondcoat,</b> its first spallation and subsequent TBC delamination become critical. Once the external alumina scale spalls, it will spall together with the TBC, leaving the system with no temperature barrier protection. Operational factors such as thermal cycling conditions, water vapour in the oxidation atmosphere, and alloying elements comprising the <b>bondcoat</b> system affect alumina scale adherence. Another problem that arises {{for the majority of}} <b>bondcoat</b> systems, &# 946; (Ni,Pt) Al and MCrAlY (M=Metal), are rich in aluminium. This causes aluminium to diffuse into the substrate, enriching it with aluminium during service, transforming phases in the substrate alloying system. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop <b>bondcoat</b> materials that promote formation of a strongly adherent TGO, but have an aluminium content near the substrate composition. Cyclic oxidation experiments were performed with Ni-Al, Ni-Pt-Al, and Ni-Pt-Al-Ir alloys in dry air and air- 12 %H 2 O. Thermal cycles of 1 hr at 1200 OC and 10 minutes at 80 OC were carried out in flowing gases at a total pressure of 1 atm. Experiments in N 2 - 12 %H 2 O were performed only on Ni-Al binary alloys. Binary Ni-Al cast alloys were tested for fundamental study purposes, while Ni-Pt-Al and Ni-Pt-Al-Ir cast alloys were intended to be models for aluminide coatings, with attention focused on &# 947;+&# 947;' -Ni-(20 to 23) Al. Comparisons were made with &# 946;-Ni- 50 Al, as it forms an external alumina scale and was found to have the smallest weight loss rate during testing of binary alloys. Assessments of Pt and Pt-Ir additions, with and without hafnium, to the &# 947;+&# 947;' binary alloy were made. Compared to binary alloys, platinum was found to reduce the total weight loss caused by scale spallation. Experiments in air- 12 %H 2 O led to more rapid weight loss than in dry air. This was due to enhanced spallation. However, the degradation rate was slower than in platinum-free alloys exposed to the same atmosphere. Partial replacement of platinum with iridium was found to improve alloy scale adherence during exposure in both dry and wet air. Addition of 1 wt% hafnium was found to reduce oxide thickness and increase the oxide adherence simultaneously. The hafnium addition was essential in order to reduce spallation rate in wet air. Water vapour in the presence of oxygen generally increased the spallation rate. It weakened the oxide metal interface, causing subsequent spallation to be increased, but only if the gas had access to the alloy-scale interface. Water vapour did not affect the spallation rate of the strongly adherent oxide grown on Ni- 22 Al- 30 Pt+ 1 wt%Hf and Ni- 20 Al- 15 Pt- 10 Ir+ 1 wt%Hf...|$|E
40|$|In load-following {{power plants}} it is {{necessary}} to adjust the electrical output to the demand within adequate time. When a steam turbine is used in a load-following power plant the availability of the plant is mainly limited by the thermal cycling behaviour of the steam turbine. Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) offer the potential to increase the operational flexibility of steam turbines. When applied to a turbine, TBCs may alter the temperature regime of components in a way that enables to shorten the start-up / shut-down procedure. Such an improvement would make load-following steam power plants more flexible in terms of electricity output. In the present study the suitability of atmospheric plasma sprayed thermal barrier coating systems for steam turbine applications was investigated. Coating systems consisted of a metallic <b>bondcoat</b> for oxidation protection, a ceramic TBC for thermal insulation and a metallic topcoat for erosion protection. The substrates on which the coatings were applied were ferritic / martensitic 1 %Cr and 10 %Cr-steels and the Ni-base alloy Nimonic 80 A. The investigated bondcoats were Ni 20 Cr, Fe 22 Cr and a CoNiCrAlY coating. The TBCs consisted of ZrO 2 / 7 wt%Y 2 O 3. The topcoat was Ni 20 Cr. The coating systems were tested at ambient pressure in Ar- 50 %H 2 O at 550 to 700 °C for up to 10000 h. TBCs were found to be stable under the investigated conditions. The <b>bondcoat</b> microstructure strongly depended on the plasma spraying parameters and particle size of the spraying powder. On the ferritic / martensitic steels CoNiCrAlY coatings showed the best performance during high temperature exposure. No cracks or delamination were observed. Submicrometer thin, protective Al 2 O 3 scales formed, which were found to prevent interdiffusion between the <b>bondcoat</b> and the substrate material. Ni 20 Cr and Fe 22 Cr bondcoats showed more oxide formation than CoNiCrAlY coatings. Also, interdiffusion with the substrate material occurred. On the Nimonic 80 A substrate only Ni 20 Cr and Fe 22 Cr bondcoats were investigated. The Ni 20 Cr <b>bondcoat</b> showed best oxidation resistance and almost totally suppressed substrate oxidation. No TBC damage or coating delamination was observed on Ni 20 Cr. The Ni 20 Cr topcoats formed cracks propagating in the underlying ceramic thus causing significant TBC damage. The reason for the crack formation are the mechanical stresses which develop when the topcoats cool down to room temperature after plasma spraying...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} pulsed electron beam (PEB) treatment of thermal sprayed MCrAlY bondcoats on the cyclic life of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). Standard MCrAlY bondcoats were produced via HVOF, VPS and LPPS thermal spray methods. Some of the HVOF and VPS coatings were then given a PEB treatment before all the samples were coated with an EB PVD 7 - 8 wt % yttria partially stabilized zirconia topcoat. The samples were all tested under cyclic oxidation conditions at 1150 °C with 1 hr at temperature and 15 min cooling, samples were removed after 20 % coating spallation and prepared for cross sectional analyses. Cyclic testing revealed that although the PEB treatment had no measurable effect on the VPS sprayed samples, the HVOF coatings showed {{a significant increase in}} the cyclic life after the PEB treatment. The effect of the PEB treatment on the various samples is discussed as well as its effect on TGO growth morphology. PEB treatment of the HVOF <b>bondcoat</b> was found to reduce the rate of alumina growth and to suppress the formation of oxide pegs resulting in a smoother <b>bondcoat</b> interface...|$|E

40|$|To remain competitive, {{gas turbine}} {{manufacturers}} must aim for continuingly improved engine efficiencies and thrust-to-weight ratio. This {{has resulted in}} the design of gas turbines with increased turbine entry temperature (TET). Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are the most promising systems, which thermally protect engine components and allow their use at higher engine gas temperature by potentially reducing metal surface temperature by up to 150 °C. The TBC system consists of a metallic <b>bondcoat</b> and a thermally insulating strain-tolerant ceramic top coat. The <b>bondcoat</b> is a critical part of the system; its failure has a major impact on the lifetime of the TBC. The purpose of this work is the development of a novel and innovative <b>bondcoat</b> with reduced weight, also called "low-mass" <b>bondcoat.</b> This new class of bond coat consisted of a thin (2. 5 to 8 J [...] lm thick) coating containing successive layers (from 9 to 163) of aluminium and platinum. The layers react with one another exothermically by diffusion after a subsequent heat-treatment at a relatively low temperature (700 °C), to form an intermetallic bond coat. In this thesis, the manufacture and optimisation of the low-mass bond coat TBC are presented and discussed. Deposition prerequisites along with good deposition practice were defined in order to produce successfully the low-mass bond coat in a clean environment. Stable working parameters were established, among which a roughness working window, as the substrate initial roughness appears to be a key parameter for coating adherence. The structure of the individual as deposited layers were characterised, which allowed to determine the surface temperature during deposition (between 150 °C and 350 °C). This was well below the temperature above which the exothermic reaction is triggered (400 °C). High-multilayered bondcoats (PtAI, PtAh, Pt 2 Ah stoichiometries) were successfully manufactured, characterised and integrated in a TBC system, among which the thinnest bond coat for THC ever made (51 layers for a 2. 5 J [...] lm thick PtAh). The low-mass bond coat TBC system presented a singular structure consisting of a dense intermetallic layer overlaid by a composite structure of Ah 03 precipitates within a (Ni,Pt) xAly matrix. Furthermore the TGO, thermally grown oxide, formed and grew with a typical equiaxed granular structure. This novel TBC system was tested along with commercial coatings under thermal cyclic oxidation, aiming to simulate the thermal cycles induced by the operating aircraft gas turbine [...] Regarding to the thickness and the aluminium reservoir of the low mass bond coats, the performances are outstanding, confirming the potentiality of this new type of TBC systems. A degradation mechanism was proposed based on FIB and SEM observations along with chemical analysis. The outstanding performance of the low mass bond coat TBC system is thought to be due to the very specific manufacturing process and its influence on the alumina scale growth under the TBC...|$|E
