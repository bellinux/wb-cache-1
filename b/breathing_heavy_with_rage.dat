They're {{all right in}} business until they get their emotions or their hair touched up too much. Then {{you want to have}} a flat footed, <b>heavy</b> <b>breathing</b> man <b>with</b> sandy whiskers, five kids and a building and loan mortgage ready as an understudy to take her desk. Now there was that widow lady that me and Andy Tucker engaged to help us in that little matrimonial agency scheme we floated out in Cairo.|$|R
60|$|Varlets had rushed {{forth to}} draw away the two dead Bretons, and a brace of English archers had carried Nigel from the field. With his own hands Aylward had unlaced the crushed helmet and had wept to see the bloodless and {{unconscious}} face of his young master. He still breathed, however, and stretched upon the grass by the riverside the bowman tended him with rude surgery, until the water upon his brow and the wind upon his face had coaxed back the life into his battered frame. He <b>breathed</b> <b>with</b> <b>heavy</b> gasps, and some tinge of blood crept hack into his cheeks, but still he lay unconscious of {{the roar of the}} crowd and of that great struggle which his comrades were now waging once again.|$|R
6000|$|We {{made our}} easting, worked {{down through the}} doldrums, and caught a fresh breeze out of south-by-west. Hauled up by the wind, on such a slant, we would fetch past the Marquesas far away to the westward. But the next day, on Tuesday, November 26, {{in the thick of}} a heavy squall, the wind shifted {{suddenly}} to the southeast. It was the trade at last. There were no more squalls, naught but fine weather, a fair wind, and a whirling log, with sheets slacked off and with spinnaker and mainsail swaying and bellying on either side. The trade backed more and more, until it blew out of the northeast, while we steered a steady course to the southwest. Ten days of this, and on the morning of December 6, at five o'clock, we sighted land [...] "just where it ought to have been," [...] dead ahead. We passed to leeward of Ua-huka, skirted the southern edge of Nuka-hiva, and that night, in driving squalls and inky darkness, fought our way in to an anchorage in the narrow bay of Taiohae. The anchor rumbled down to the blatting of wild goats on the cliffs, and the air we <b>breathed</b> was <b>heavy</b> <b>with</b> the perfume of flowers. The traverse was accomplished. Sixty days from land to land, across a lonely sea above whose horizons never rise the straining sails of ships.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his book}} Behind the Pink Curtain (2008), Jasper Sharp writes that Mamoru Watanabe's pink films are usually [...] "lyrical... {{and full of}} poetic {{symbolism}} and striking pictorial compositions..." [...] Watanabe opens Slave Widow with close-ups of Noriko Tatsumi's body rising and falling {{to the sound of}} <b>heavy</b> <b>breathing,</b> juxtaposed <b>with</b> images of the lake near her country villa. Watanabe's skillful use of sound is also evident in the contrast between Mitsuko and Kazuhiko's two love scenes. In the first, a lyrical scene which takes place near the lake in which Mitsuko will drown herself, the visuals are accompanied by natural sounds such as crickets, birds and water. In the second, which takes place in Tokyo, the desperation of Mitsuko's situation is emphasized with harsh city noises such as non-stop traffic.|$|R

Zimmerman looked out of shape during the fight, evident from his chubby body and <b>breathing</b> <b>heavy</b> after the first round. Because of this and his inconsistency he dropped rapidly from the top 15 world heavyweight kickboxers.|$|R
