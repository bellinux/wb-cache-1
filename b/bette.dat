5|$|Batwoman also begins {{hunting down}} a crazed serial killer {{known as the}} Cutter, who has been abducting young women and cutting off parts of their face {{in order to create}} the perfect woman. He {{eventually}} kidnaps <b>Bette,</b> but Kate tracks the killer to his lair and attacks him. During the fight, Batwoman reveals her identity to <b>Bette</b> when she mentions her tennis career, and in the aftermath <b>Bette</b> is seen in her Flamebird outfit, saying that she wants to be Kate's new partner.|$|E
5|$|Gender roles, {{especially}} {{the figure of}} the ideal woman, are central to La Cousine <b>Bette.</b> The four leading female characters (<b>Bette,</b> Valérie, Adeline, and Hortense) embody stereotypically feminine traits. Each pair of women revolves around a man, and they compete for his attention: Valérie and Adeline for Baron Hulot; <b>Bette</b> and Hortense for Wenceslas Steinbock. Balzac's study of masculinity is limited to the insatiable lust of Hulot and the weak-willed inconstancy of Steinbock, with the occasional appearance of Victorin as a sturdy patriarch in his father's absence.|$|E
5|$|Balzac {{had written}} more than seventy novels {{when he began}} La Cousine <b>Bette,</b> and {{populated}} them with recurring characters. Many {{of the characters in}} the novel, therefore, appear with extensive back-stories and biographical depth. For example, Célestin Crevel first appeared in Balzac's 1837 novel César Birotteau, working for the title character. Having accumulated a considerable fortune in that book, Crevel spends his time in La Cousine <b>Bette</b> enjoying the spoils of his labor. Another important recurring character is Marshal Hulot, who first appeared as a colonel in Les Chouans. In the years between that story and La Cousine <b>Bette,</b> he became the Count of Forzheim; {{in a letter to the}} Constitutionnel, Balzac described how Marshal Hulot gained this title. The presence of Crevel and Marshal Hulot– among others– in La Cousine <b>Bette</b> allows a continuation of each character's life story, adding emphasis or complexity to earlier events.|$|E

50|$|Abrams & <b>Bettes</b> Beyond the Forecast, {{commonly}} abbreviated Abrams & <b>Bettes,</b> Beyond the Forecast, or A&B, was {{a weather}} program produced by The Weather Channel.|$|R
50|$|Launched 25 September 2006, A&B {{was named}} for its primary pair of on-camera meteorologists, Stephanie Abrams and Mike <b>Bettes.</b> In its final five months, the one-hour program {{immediately}} preceded an hour of Evening Edition also hosted by Abrams and <b>Bettes</b> that featured exactly the same content and format of that night's Abrams & <b>Bettes</b> broadcast. The program consists of weather maps, news, and discussion.|$|R
5|$|Jenny {{spends her}} final days putting {{together}} a film of memories for <b>Bette</b> and Tina. The film contains friends past and present sharing their best moments. During the going-away party held for <b>Bette</b> and Tina, who are planning on moving to New York, they watch the film and Jenny is found dead in the swimming pool in the back yard. It is assumed that she either fell or was pushed from the landing above the back steps, which is unfinished and lacks a proper railing. Because {{so many people have}} been offended, betrayed and hurt by Jenny, there are many suspects and they are interrogated.|$|E
5|$|Mme. Hulot's cousin, <b>Bette</b> (also called Lisbeth), harbors a deep but hidden {{resentment of}} her relatives' success. A peasant woman {{with none of}} the {{physical}} beauty of her cousin, <b>Bette</b> has rejected a series of marriage proposals from middle-class suitors, and remains unmarried at the age of 42. One day she comes upon a young unsuccessful Polish sculptor named Wenceslas Steinbock, attempting suicide in the tiny apartment upstairs from her own. As she nourishes him back to health, she develops a maternal fondness for him. She also befriends Valérie, the wife of a War Department clerk named Marneffe; the two women form a bond of mutual affection and protection.|$|E

50|$|His wife {{may have}} been Magdalen Browne of St Gregory's parish. They married on 1 December 1571. A son, Thomas <b>Bettes,</b> died in August 1593, and a {{daughter}} Judith was born in July 1599. Bettes' first wife died, and he married Ellianor Harman on 8 September 1614. John <b>Bettes</b> died in January 1616 and bequeathed his son (also John) a picture of John <b>Bettes</b> the Elder, two easels, and a porphyry slab and muller for grinding pigments.|$|R
5|$|The Crawford–Davis rivalry is {{the subject}} of the 2017 first season of the FX {{anthology}} television series Feud, subtitled <b>Bette</b> and Joan. Crawford is played by Jessica Lange; Davis by Susan Sarandon.|$|E
5|$|The novel's {{characters}} represent polarities of contrasting morality. The vengeful <b>Bette</b> and disingenuous Valérie {{stand on}} one side, with the merciful Adeline and her patient daughter Hortense on the other. The {{patriarch of the}} Hulot family, meanwhile, is consumed by his own sexual desire. Hortense's husband, the Polish exile Wenceslas Steinbock, represents artistic genius, though he succumbs to uncertainty and lack of motivation. Balzac based the character of <b>Bette</b> in part on his mother and the poet Marceline Desbordes-Valmore. At least one scene involving Baron Hulot was likely based on an event {{in the life of}} Balzac's friend, the novelist Victor Hugo.|$|E
5|$|Balzac's usual mode of {{revision}} involved vast, complicated edits made to galley proofs {{he received}} from the printer. When creating La Cousine <b>Bette,</b> however, he submitted the work to his editor piece by piece, without viewing a single proof. The book was serialized in Le Constitutionnel from 8October to 3December, and Balzac rushed {{to keep up with}} the newspaper's rapid printing schedule. He produced an average of eight pages each day, but was struck by the unexpected enormity of the story as it evolved. Balzac was paid 12,836 francs for the series, which was later published with Le Cousin Pons as a twelve-volume book by Chiendowski and Pétion. The first collected edition of La Cousine <b>Bette</b> was organized into 132 chapters, but these divisions were removed when Balzac added it to his massive collection La Comédie humaine in 1848.|$|E
50|$|A {{miniature}} {{portrait of}} Francis Walsingham, who was buried at St Gregory's Church in 1590, {{in the possession}} of the Duke of Buccleuch is attributed to <b>Bettes.</b> John <b>Bettes</b> and his studio are thought to have made a number of portraits of Elizabeth I.|$|R

5|$|In 1971, the Seattle Opera under {{director}} Richard Pearlman {{produced the}} first ever fully staged professional production of Tommy at Seattle's Moore Theatre. The production included <b>Bette</b> Midler {{playing the role of}} the Acid Queen and Mrs. Walker, and music by the Syracuse, New York band Comstock, Ltd.|$|E
5|$|Le Cousin Pons (1847) and La Cousine <b>Bette</b> (1848) {{tell the}} story of Les Parents Pauvres (The Poor Relations). The conniving and wrangling over wills and inheritances reflect the {{expertise}} gained by the author as a young law clerk. Balzac's health was deteriorating by this point, making the completion of this pair of books a significant accomplishment.|$|E
5|$|Other {{recurring}} characters appear {{only briefly}} in La Cousine Bette; previous appearances, however, give deep {{significance to the}} characters' presence. This {{is the case with}} Vautrin, the criminal mastermind who tutors young Eugene de Rastignac in Balzac's 1835 novel Le Père Goriot. When he resurfaces in La Cousine <b>Bette,</b> he has joined the police and introduces the Hulot family to his aunt, Mme. Nourrison, who offers a morally questionable remedy for their woes. Although Vautrin's presence in La Cousine <b>Bette</b> is brief, his earlier adventures in Le Père Goriot provide instant recognition and emotional texture. Elsewhere, Balzac presents an entire world of experience by including characters from a particular sphere of society. For example, several scenes feature artists like Jean-Jacques Bixiou, who first appeared in 1837's Les Employés and in many other books thereafter. The world of Parisian nightlife is quickly brought to mind with the inclusion of several characters from Les Comédiens sans le savoir (1846), and Bianchon appears– as always– when a doctor is needed.|$|E

Like Isaac Oliver and Rowland Lockey, <b>Bettes</b> the Younger is {{believed}} to have studied under Nicholas Hilliard. He lived in London on Grub Street in St Giles Cripplegate. In later years he moved to the parish of St Gregory-by-St Pauls.|$|R
5000|$|One {{after the}} other, they fall into ruin under <b>Bette's</b> subtle guidance. Baron Hulot suffers a {{debilitating}} stroke, Hortense finds herself in prison, <b>Bette's</b> nephew, Victoren, flees {{for his life}} from loan sharks, Wenceslas is left a dead mockery of an artist, and the family name is in shamed and impoverished tatters.|$|R
5|$|To {{celebrate}} their six-month anniversary, Long Island socialites Tony and Carlotta Milburn arrange a wild drinking party with friends, {{culminating in a}} stop at the restaurant owned by Faronea. They are unaware that Faronea is conspiring with Baptiste Bouclier, the chauffeur of party host Vic Huling, to kidnap Vic. The next morning the Milburns awake hung over to find Vic dead from a gunshot through the heart and his wife <b>Bette</b> missing. Tony calls his friend, district attorney Danny Harrison to investigate. <b>Bette</b> arrives with Billy Arliss at whose home she had slept. Because of their excessive drinking, no one can remember anything about what had happened the night before. As circumstantial evidence mounts against Tony, he calls in hypnotist Professor Karl Jones to help everyone try to recover their memories. Just as the professor is about to reveal the murderer, he is murdered.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} of his novels, Balzac {{analyzes}} the influence of history and social status in La Cousine <b>Bette.</b> The book takes places between 1838 and 1846, when the reign of Louis-Philippe reflected and directed {{significant changes in the}} social structure. Balzac was a legitimist favoring the House of Bourbon, and idolized Napoleon Bonaparte as a paragon of effective absolutist power. Balzac felt that French society under the House of Orléans lacked strong leadership, and was fragmented by the demands of parliament. He also believed that Catholicism provided guidance for the nation, and that its absence heralded moral decay.|$|E
5|$|B: <b>Bette</b> Davis's {{performance}} in Of Human Bondage was not {{nominated for an}} Oscar. Several influential people at the time campaigned to have her name included on the list, so for that year (and the following year also) the Academy relaxed its rules and allowed a write-in vote. Technically this meant that any performance was eligible to win the award, {{regardless of whether they}} were an official nominee or not. While the Academy does not officially recognize this as a nomination for Davis, they have included her in the list of nominees for the 1935 ceremony on their official website.|$|E
50|$|On April 16, 2012, {{the program}} was revamped with new on-air graphics. In addition, Stephanie Abrams began co-hosting the show from New York City from 7-9 a.m. ET only. For the 9 a.m. hour, Mike <b>Bettes</b> was joined by either Eric Fisher, Jen Carfagno or Maria LaRosa from Atlanta. The network gave this format a three-month trial run, likely {{planning}} to move Abrams permanently to New York {{if it had been}} successful. On July 30, 2012, Abrams returned to the Atlanta studio, and she and Mike <b>Bettes</b> resumed hosting the show for all three hours. However, two weeks later on August 13, Stephanie Abrams moved to the New York City studio full-time. She and Mike <b>Bettes</b> continued to host the show from 7 to 9 a.m. while Maria LaRosa joined <b>Bettes</b> for the 9 a.m. hour.|$|R

5|$|Balzac {{has also}} {{influenced}} popular culture. Many {{of his works}} have been made into popular films and television serials, including: Travers Vale's Père Goriot (1915), Les Chouans (1947), Le Père Goriot (1968 BBC mini-series), and La Cousine <b>Bette</b> (1974 BBC mini-series, starring Margaret Tyzack and Helen Mirren; 1998 film, starring Jessica Lange). Balzac is mentioned to humorous effect in Meredith Willson's musical The Music Man. He is included in François Truffaut's 1959 film, The 400 Blows. Truffaut believed Balzac and Proust {{to be the greatest}} French writers.|$|E
5|$|Before {{publication}} of the novel, several Hollywood executives and studios declined to create a film based on it, including Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Pandro Berman at RKO Pictures, and David O. Selznick of Selznick International Pictures. Jack L. Warner liked the story, but Warner Bros.'s biggest star <b>Bette</b> Davis was uninterested, and Darryl Zanuck of 20th Century-Fox did not offer enough money. Selznick changed his mind after his story editor Kay Brown and business partner John Hay Whitney urged him to buy the film rights. In July 1936—a month after it was published—Selznick bought the rights for $50,000.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} November 1996, with the moving of {{underground}} pipes and wires around the station areas.

The same month, the Public Transport Authority gave the necessary permits to operate a driverless metro. The section between Fasanvej and Frederiksberg is a former S-train line, and was last operated as such on 20 June 1998.|$|E
50|$|From May 5 to June 12, 2009, Mike <b>Bettes</b> {{left the}} studio {{to report on the}} Vortex 2 project, a project in which {{researchers}} spent five weeks in Tornado Alley (the region comprising the Great Plains and South Central United States that is the most climatalogically favorable for tornado development) tracking tornadoes with weather researchers in an attempt to discover more information about the formation of these storms. Throughout the entire duration of the project, <b>Bettes</b> reported live in the field during Weather Center with Abrams & <b>Bettes</b> each evening, except for instances in which the Vortex 2 project was suspended for the day due to lack of tornadic activity. Several editions of the show featured <b>Bettes</b> and the Vortex 2 crew actively chasing potential tornado-producing supercells; on June 5, 2009, the crew caught its first and only tornado of the year live on PM Edition, the coverage of which spilled over into the beginning of Weather Center; both programs covered the entire tornado event without commercial interruption. While <b>Bettes</b> was reporting with the project crew, TWC on-camera meteorologist Adam Berg substituted for him in the studio.|$|R
