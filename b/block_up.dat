5|$|In 1370 the French made a {{successful}} attack on Portsmouth, commencing a new sequence of raids along the English coast. In due course first Edward, then Richard II, responded by improving the defences {{in the south}} of England. Part of this involved improving the condition of Southampton Castle, where, owing in part to the theft of building materials, including stone and lead, by the citizens of the town, the defences were in a poor condition. Henry Yevele, who oversaw the improvements to the castle, probably also constructed the Arcades along the western walls in 1380: this involved adopting the 1360 proposal to <b>block</b> <b>up</b> the properties along the western quay to form a solid wall, and adding three towers and gunports. Sir John Sondes and John Polymond were appointed by the king in 1386 to further improve the town walls, working with Sir John Arundel, the castle governor – Polymond and Arundel Towers were probably named after these men around this time.|$|E

25|$|Matthew Hoggard was a {{specialist}} orthodox swing bowler, and usually took the new ball for England in Test cricket. Hoggard's primary {{role in the}} team was to utilise the shine on the new ball to test the technique of top-order batsmen against the swinging delivery. If, due to pitch or atmospheric conditions, the new ball did not swing he could be ineffective. Hoggard {{was seen as the}} consistent bowler in the team. Hoggard also had a sound defensive batting technique, but was not known for scoring runs, averaging only 7.40 with the bat. He could <b>block</b> <b>up</b> an end for the batsman at the other end to score, and was also used as a nightwatchman.|$|E

25|$|Although the British {{intelligence}} {{doubted that}} the French invasion would take place, the counter-invasion orders of 1797 were reintroduced. The number of sloops and gun brigs in the Channel Islands were increased. In the southern counties cattle were driven inland, and main roads were blocked. Nelson, who {{recently returned from}} the Baltic, received detailed instructions of the admiralty to be employed in the defence of the mouths of the Thames and Medway, and {{all parts of the}} coast of Sussex, Essex and Kent. He was also required to <b>block</b> <b>up</b> or destroy, if practicable, the French vessels and craft in the ports wherein they may be assembled. All the intelligence pointed to Boulogne as the main port in which the French invasion craft were gathering, so Lord Nelson set course to there.|$|E
25|$|Butler and Stringham left {{immediately}} after the battle, the former to Washington and the latter accompanying the prisoners to New York. Critics argued that each was trying to gather credit for the victory to himself. The pair contended, however, {{that they were trying}} to persuade the administration to abandon the original plan to <b>block</b> <b>up</b> Hatteras Inlet. In Federal hands it was no longer useful to the Confederacy, and in fact now allowed Union forces to pursue raiders into the sounds. Although they and their supporters continued to press the case for several weeks, it seems to have been unnecessary. The War and Navy Departments had already decided to retain possession of the inlet, which would be used as the entry point of an amphibious expedition against the North Carolina mainland early the next year. This campaign, known as Burnside's North Carolina Expedition for its senior Army commander Ambrose E. Burnside, completely removed the sounds as sources of commerce-raiding activity.|$|E

500|$|Many erratic surface {{fractures}} {{were generated}} in the San Joaquin Valley along the White Wolf Fault. The cracks were not well-defined, and {{were the result of}} the disturbance of the alluvium that makes up the valley floor, rather than cracking along the fault trace. Northeast trending cracks ranging from hairline-width to near five inches wide were seen between Arvin and California State Route 166, and some showed clear lateral offset, but those were determined to be localized effects. Some of the fractures in the ground were aligned with the fault, and some were perpendicular to the general trend, but the more significant breaks were believed to be a direct result of faulting at depth. This was true in the mountainous areas as well, but some of the breaks at the higher elevations were probably related to slumping. The northeast trending breaks were described in a report from the State of California (that was prepared by well-known geologists and seismologists) as [...] "thrusting of the southeast <b>block</b> <b>up</b> and over the northwest block, and/or a lateral movement of the southeast block to the northeast".|$|E
500|$|Reece Thompson plays Hal Hefner, a shy fifteen-year-old {{student at}} Plainsboro High School, New Jersey with a {{pronounced}} stutter. Beginning in late 2004, Rocket Sciences producers traveled to several American and Canadian cities {{looking for an}} actor to play the lead role of Hal. At one point, Carter Jenkins was set to play Hal, but NBC blocked this as he was contracted for further episodes of Surface. HBO Films told the producers {{after six months of}} searching for a Hal that it would abandon the project if a lead actor was not found in two weeks, at which point a desperate Jeffrey Blitz watched all of the unsolicited audition tapes that he had been sent and [...] "knew immediately we had a promising candidate" [...] when he saw Thompson's tape. Although a casting call was originally posted for a teenage boy aged 13–18 who had a stutter and could also act, Thompson had previously been taught how to stutter. However Blitz wanted Hal to stutter in a different style, knowing he was going to <b>block</b> <b>up</b> on a particular word and looking for ways to work round it. Before filming, Thompson was taught this specific style by a speech pathologist.|$|E

2500|$|A Working Kelpie {{can be a}} {{cheap and}} {{efficient}} worker that can save farmers and graziers the cost of several hands when mustering livestock. The good working Kelpies are herding dogs that will prevent stock from {{moving away from the}} stockman. This natural instinct is crucial when mustering stock in isolated gorge country, where a good dog will silently move ahead of the stockman and <b>block</b> <b>up</b> the stock (usually cattle) until the rider appears. The preferred dogs for cattle work are Kelpies, often of a special line, or a Kelpie cross. [...] They will drive a mob of livestock long distances in extremes of climates and conditions. Kelpies have natural instincts for managing livestock. They will work sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and other domestic livestock. The Kelpie's signature move is to jump on the backs of sheep and walk across the tops of the sheep to reach the other side and break up the jam. A good working Kelpie is a versatile dogthey can work all day on the farm, ranch, or station, and trial on the weekends. Kelpies compete and are exhibited in livestock working trials, ranging from yards or arenas to large open fields working sheep, goats, cattle, or ducks.|$|E
2500|$|General Hindman was presuming a {{scorched}} earth {{policy to}} hinder {{the advance of}} General Curtis through northeast Arkansas. On 24 June 1862 General Hindman telegrammed Col. Matlock, directing him to attempt to hinder Curtis advices down the White River by [...] "falling trees into all fords. Destroying all bridges and ferry boats, and in every way obstructing the roads. Destroying all forage and subsistence that cannot be removed within five miles of the road. Call out the entire Negro force in every direction along the Augusta and Jacksonport roads. Burn all bridges and <b>block</b> <b>up</b> all boards especially of village creek. If followed by the enemy attack him at all points continuing however the work of obstruction. In falling back obstruct every foot of road. Place your train at some convenient place well in your rear. If you can certainly accomplish what is above directed, {{and at the same}} time strike the enemy at Smithville do, so risk nothing in this. The work of obstruction is the greatest importance. You are expected to do your whole duty. Your movements are part of a general plan. Your failure would defeat the whole. Keep open your communication with these Head Quarters also with Clarendon. If the enemy should land at that point burn bridges and obstruct roads." ...|$|E
