5|$|Baltimore {{was home}} to a major doo wop scene {{in the middle of}} the 20th century, which began with The Orioles, who are {{considered}} one of the first doo wop groups to record commercially. By the 1950s, Baltimore {{was home to}} numerous African American vocal groups, and talent scouts scoured the city for the next <b>big</b> <b>stars.</b> Many bands emerged from the city, including The Cardinals and The Plants. Some doo wop groups were connected with street gangs, and some members were active in both scenes, such as Johnny Page of The Marylanders. Competitive music and dance was a part of African American street gang culture, and with the success of some local groups, pressure mounted, leading to territorial rivalries among performers. Pennsylvania Avenue served as a rough boundary between East and West Baltimore, with the East producing The Swallows and The Cardinals, as well as The Sonnets, The Jollyjacks, The Honey Boys, The Magictones and The Blentones, while the West was home to The Orioles and The Plants, as well as The Twilighters and The Four Buddies.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} considered Danny Denzongpa for {{the role}} of bandit chief Gabbar Singh, but he could not accept it as he was committed to act in Feroz Khan's Dharmatma (1975), under production at the same time. Amjad Khan, who was the second choice, prepared himself for the part by reading the book Abhishapta Chambal, which told of the exploits of Chambal dacoits. The book was written by Taroon Kumar Bhaduri, the father of fellow cast member Jaya Bhaduri. As cast members had read the script ahead of time, many were interested in playing different parts. Pran was considered {{for the role}} of Thakur Baldev Singh, but Sippy thought Sanjeev Kumar was a better choice. Initially, Dharmendra was also interested {{to play the role of}} Thakur. He eventually gave up the role when Sippy informed him that Sanjeev Kumar would play Veeru if that happened, and would be paired with Hema Malini, who Dharmendra was trying to woo. Dharmendra knew that Kumar was also interested in Malini. Sippy wanted Shatrughan Sinha to play the part of Jai, but there were already several <b>big</b> <b>stars</b> signed, and Amitabh Bachchan, who was not extremely popular yet, lobbied hard to get the part for himself.|$|E

Frew McMillan, Tom Okker and Françoise Dürr all returned to the Golden Gaters for the 1977 season. The team added John and Terry Holladay and Betsy Nagelsen. The Golden Gaters also signed Henry Schneidman as an assistant coach.|$|E

500|$|In {{cutting back}} state {{programs}} and social services, Baker caused controversy from early on. However, some government officials called him an [...] "innovator" [...] and [...] "one of the <b>big</b> <b>stars</b> among the secretariats and the agencies". Baker {{was promoted to}} Secretary of Health and Human Services in November 1992, and was later made Secretary of Administration and Finance, a position he continued to hold after Weld resigned in 1997 and Paul Cellucci took over as acting governor. In mid-1998, Cellucci offered him the lieutenant governor spot on the ticket, but Baker declined.|$|E
500|$|The MGM moguls {{were careful}} {{to protect their}} {{contract}} <b>big</b> <b>stars</b> from controversy, and Tracy wished to conceal his relationship with Hepburn from his wife, so it was hidden from the public. The couple did not live together until {{the final years of}} Tracy's life, when they shared a cottage on George Cukor's estate in Beverly Hills. In Hollywood, however, the intimate nature of the Tracy-Hepburn partnership was an open secret. Angela Lansbury, who worked with the pair on State of the Union, later said: [...] "We all knew, but nobody ever said anything. In those days it wasn't discussed." [...] Tracy was not someone to express his emotions, but friend Betsy Drake believed he [...] "was utterly dependent upon Hepburn." [...] Tracy's infidelity apparently continued, however, and he is reported to have had an affair with Gene Tierney during the making of Plymouth Adventure in 1952.|$|E
500|$|Though Spielberg {{complied}} with {{a request from}} Zanuck and Brown to cast known actors, he wanted to avoid hiring any <b>big</b> <b>stars.</b> He felt that [...] "somewhat anonymous" [...] performers would help the audience [...] "believe this was happening to {{people like you and}} me", whereas [...] "stars bring a lot of memories along with them, and those memories can sometimes... corrupt the story." [...] The director added that in his plans [...] "the superstar was gonna be the shark". The first actors cast were Lorraine Gary, the wife of then-president of Universal Sid Sheinberg, as Ellen Brody, and Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island. Stuntwoman-turned-actress Susan Backlinie was cast as Chrissie (the first victim) as she knew how to swim and was willing to perform nude. Most minor roles were played by residents of Martha's Vineyard, where the film was shot. One example was Deputy Hendricks, played by future television producer Jeffrey Kramer.|$|E

500|$|This was {{the first}} time the Coen {{brothers}} chose <b>big</b> <b>stars</b> to act in their movie. Joel Silver's first choice for Norville Barnes was Tom Cruise, but the Coens persisted in a desire to cast Tim Robbins. Winona Ryder and Bridget Fonda were in competition for the role of Amy Archer before Jennifer Jason Leigh was cast. Leigh had previously auditioned for a role in the Coens's Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink. Her failed auditions prompted the Coens to cast her in The Hudsucker Proxy. To prepare for her role as Amy Archer, Leigh read the biographies of some of the most substantial ladies of the thirties and forties such as, Rosalind Russell, Katharine Hepburn and Jean Arthur. When casting the role of Sidney Mussburger, [...] "Warner Bros. suggested all sorts of names," [...] remembered Joel. [...] "A lot of them were comedians who were clearly wrong. Mussburger is the bad guy and Paul Newman brought that character to life." [...] However, the Coens first offered the role to Clint Eastwood, but he was forced to turn it down due to scheduling conflicts.|$|E
500|$|L.A. Takedown {{received}} mixed-to-positive {{reviews from}} film critics, with its acting {{being the most}} poorly received. On its first airing, The Globe and Mail gave the film a two star rating. Hal Erickson of AllRovi compared the film to Mann's cult TV series Miami Vice, but felt it emphasized style over substance. Dragan Antulov for Movie Reviews in Croatian (...) , in comparing the film with its remake, Heat, praised Mann's choice to hire unknown actors for L.A. Takedown, which contrasted with <b>big</b> <b>stars</b> in Heat. Although he derided Berkeley's performance as Waingro, he concluded that it was [...] "a fine companion piece to Heat." [...] A reviewer from Lexikon des Internationalen Films of Germany was less enthusiastic, citing routine action sequences and a confusing plot due to the overly large cast. Lol Frost of Empire gave L.A. Takedown two out of five stars, acknowledging the worthiness of the plot, but citing lack of Mann's typical filming style. Frost concluded that the film was [...] "a bit of a dud, but a noble effort." ...|$|E
500|$|Mokashi {{did a few}} small-time {{roles for}} Hindi TV serials and feature films, {{including}} Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999) but soon he turned to writing and directing. Mokashi came across a biography of Dadasaheb Phalke, {{also known as the}} father of Indian cinema, written by Bapu Watve. With an idea of making film on Phalke, Mokashi started his research with the help of National Film Archive of India, Pune and finished the script by March 2005. As Mokashi did not undergo any formal training for film-making and did not assist any other film directors earlier, he found it difficult to find producers for the film and it took three years to raise finances for the film. Declining the suggestions of making the film in Hindi, casting <b>big</b> <b>stars,</b> adding at least one title track, Mokashi decided to produce the film by himself through his production company, [...] "Mayasabha Productions".

Bucci believed that with the abundance of talent and high quality television production of Fire Bird TV would help gain an edge over his other competitors.

2500|$|In the United States and Canada, {{the film}} grossed $5.2 million on its opening day. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $15.3 million, below the studio's $20 million projection, and {{finished}} third {{at the box}} office. Several factors {{have been attributed to}} the financial failure of Pan. Forbes blogger Scott Mendelson attributed this to the absence of notable movie stars. Despite the presence of Jackman, [...] "like any number of would-be <b>big</b> <b>stars</b> who are best known for a certain franchise, his opening weekend strength dips when he's not playing his trademark character." [...] Outside of the X-Men franchise, his biggest openings are Van Helsing ($51 million) and the $27 million debuts of Real Steel and Les Misérables. Variety described the departure of the film in tone and writings that made earlier Peter Pan stories and films a success; from Jackman's role as Blackbeard to the inclusion of contemporary pop songs from Nirvana and the Ramones which is peculiar for a children's film adaptation. [...] "Without the Disney seal of approval, audiences are a bit wary of these fairy tale adaptations," [...] said Jeff Bock, a box office analyst with Exhibitor Relations. He added, [...] "It veered off the Peter Pan path quite extensively and it was just too far left of center for a generation that grew up with Hook and sees that as the definitive account." [...] Warner Bros. declined to discuss Pans box office results.|$|E

She married Željko Ražnatović [...] "Arkan", a controversial figure in Serbia during the Yugoslav wars, in a wedding that was broadcast on national television. Ja još spavam, Vazduh koji dišem, Volela sam, volela, Nije monotonija, Ljubav fatalna, Idi dok si mlad, Beograd, Da li to ljubav pravi do nas slabiće, Kad bi bio ranjen, Mrtvo more, Neodoljiv, neumoljiv, Usnule lepotice, Isuse, Doktor followed in this period during the wars. In 1997, the singer became a national brand (with PGP-RTS), with commercial success with album Maskarada and songs Maskarada, Nevaljala, Pogrešan broj, Vreteno, Nagovori, Kažem da te volim. In January 2001 her husband was shot dead {{in front of the}} Crowne Plaza Belgrade, which forced her to stop promoting her latest album.
