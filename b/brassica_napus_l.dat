50|$|Colza oil or Rapeseed oil is a nondrying oil {{obtained}} from the seeds of Rapeseed (<b>Brassica</b> <b>napus</b> subsp. <b>napus.</b> syn. <b>Brassica</b> <b>napus</b> var. oleifera Delile, <b>Brassica</b> campestris subsp. <b>napus</b> (<b>L.)</b> Hook.f. & T.Anderson.) Colza is extensively cultivated in France, Belgium, the United States, the Netherlands, Germany and Poland. In France, especially, the extraction of the oil is an important industry. In commerce, colza is a traditional rapeseed oil (with turnip rape oil, sarson oil, toria oil (Brassica rapa ssp.), and ravison oil), {{to which they are}} very closely allied in both source and properties. It is a comparatively nonodoriferous oil of a yellow colour, having a specific gravity varying between 0.912 and 0.920. The cake left after extraction of the oil is a valuable feed ingredient for pigs.|$|R

Genotypes of both Brassica species showed great variability for different morphological characteristics like plant height, primary branches per plant, days to 50 % flowering and maturity {{as well as for}} yield and yield characteristics. Brassica juncea produced significantly greater yield and yield parameters than B. napus genotypes. Seed oil content was higher in <b>Brassica</b> <b>napus</b> while the levels of erucic acid and glucosinolates were lower in B. napus than in B. juncea. The results suggested that genotypes RBN- 03255 and RBN- 03035 of B. napus with higher oil content could be recommended for cultivation for commercial use. Moreover, the great variability in oil glucosinolates and erucic acid content in genotypes of B. napus showed their potential for utilization in breeding programs at intra- and inter-specific level...|$|R

5000|$|Canola oil, or canola for short, is a {{vegetable}} oil derived from rapeseed {{and low in}} erucic acid, as opposed to colza oil. There are both edible and industrial forms produced from the seed of any of several cultivars of rapeseed Brassicaceae family of plants, namely cultivars of <b>Brassica</b> <b>napus</b> <b>L.,</b> Brassica rapa subsp. oleifera, syn.

5000|$|The {{proteins}} are {{toxic to}} animal cells, presumably attacking the cell membrane and rendering it permeable: {{this results in}} the inhibition of sugar uptake and allows potassium and phosphate ions, proteins, and nucleotides to leak from cells. Thionins are mainly found in seeds where they may act as a defence against consumption by animals. A barley (Hordeum vulgare) leaf thionin that is highly toxic to plant pathogens and {{is involved in the}} mechanism of plant defence against microbial infections has also been identified. The hydrophobic protein crambin from the Abyssinian kale (Crambe abyssinica) {{is also a member of}} the thionin family. Some thionins have cytotoxic activity and they are therefore interesting in the development of new drugs against cancer with novel action mechanisms. No thionin has yet been developed into an anti-cancer drug. Thionin is also a minor protein found in mustard (<b>Brassica</b> <b>napus</b> <b>L.)</b> seeds.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{increasing}} {{efforts are}} made to develop environmentally safer pest control methods. One such method can be the use of natural antifeedants.

The insect antifeedant activity of the four substances was investigated by circular leaf disc dual choice bioassay. After 24 hours the surfaces of the leaf disc remnants were measured with leaf area analyser. Ajuga chamaepitys L. extracts and copper were taken as standard. The tested 3 plant extracts were prepared from leaves diluted with water. SGTCI was tested with doses between 1 - 2 mg/ml.

40|$|Turnip tops or greens, {{the early}} leaves of {{rutabaga}} (<b>Brassica</b> <b>napus</b> var. rapifera <b>L.),</b> are a traditional Newfoundland vegetable. Commercial farmers currently grow and market forage rape (B. <b>napus</b> <b>L.)</b> as greens. Our objectives were to determine why forage rape is now grown in preference to other Brassica crops {{and to examine}} potential greens alternatives. Seed from two cultivars each of three Brassicas [rutabaga, forage rape and forage kale (Brassica oleracea var. medullosa L.) ] was used in: 1) a germination study at 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C; 2) a growth study at constant temperature regimes of 12 and 18 °C; 3) a 2 yr agronomic study; and 4) a sensory evaluation for appearance and taste as a boiled vegetable. Hobson rape, Dwarf Essex rape and the locally bred Brookfield rutabaga germinated, emerged and grew faster than both kale cultivars and Laurentian rutabaga at all controlled-temperature regimes. The two kale cultivars and Laurentian rutabaga did not exhibit adequate agronomic potential. Although the rape cultivars were among the top-yielding entries at most harvests, Brookfield rutabaga yielded greater leaf weight in both years of the agronomic study.

Undeniable benefits of rutabaga are its low cultivation demands, relatively short growing season and frost hardiness. These properties allow its cultivation even in borderline areas and provide fresh vegetable harvest until late autumn. Another benefit is vitamin and mineral content in rutabaga. Aim of the degustation was to acquaint people with this species and as the results show, they do have an interest in rutabaga. The taste of rutabaga was very highly rated and evaluators shown demand for more information. As mentioned before, rutabaga was grown in this country in the past.

40|$|Epoxiconazole {{like others}} {{triazole}} fungicides {{are known to}} be persistent in the soil. Several studies using foliar application experiments demonstrated the effect of its triazole metabolite as plant growth regulator through the anti-gibberellin activity. And notably, the reduction of <b>Brassica</b> <b>napus</b> <b>L.</b> growth {{can be attributed to the}} inhibition of gibberellin biosynthesis at the stage of conversion of ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid. We describe here an in vitro experiment studying the relationship between epoxiconazole in culture medium (0 mg L⁻¹, 0. 120 mg L⁻¹ and 0. 200 mg L⁻¹) and the phenotyping (root and shoot growth) of three varieties of winter rapeseeds (<b>Brassica</b> <b>napus</b> <b>L.</b> var.

40|$|Gain-of-function {{studies have}} shown that ectopic {{expression}} of the BABY BOOM (BBM) AP 2 /ERF domain transcription factor is sufficient to induce spontaneous somatic embryogenesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana (<b>L.)</b> Heynh) and <b>Brassica</b> <b>napus</b> (B. <b>napus</b> <b>L.)</b> seedlings. Here we examined the effect of ectopic BBM expression on the development and regenerative capacity of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) through heterologous expression of Arabidopsis and B. napus BBM genes. 35 S::BBM tobacco lines exhibited a number of the phenotypes previously observed in 35 S::BBM Arabidopsis and B. napus transgenics, including callus formation, leaf rumpling, and sterility, but they did not undergo spontaneous somatic embryogenesis. 35 S::BBM plants with severe ectopic expression phenotypes could not be assessed for enhanced regeneration at the seedling stage due to complete male and female sterility of the primary transformants, therefore fertile BBM ectopic expression lines with strong misexpression phenotypes were generated by expressing a steroid-inducible, post-translationally controlled BBM fusion protein (BBM:GR) under the control of a 35 S promoter. These lines exhibited spontaneous shoot and root formation, while somatic embryogenesis could be induced from in-vitro germinated seedling hypocotyls cultured on media supplemented with cytokinin. Together these results suggest that ectopic BBM expression in transgenic tobacco also activates cell proliferation pathways, but differences exist between Arabidopsis/B. napus and N. tabacum with respect to their competence to respond to the BBM signalling molecul...|$|R

Compared to <b>Brassica</b> juncea, <b>Brassica</b> <b>napus</b> treated plants showed a higher lipid peroxidation level expressed as malondialdehyde production. Studies of the lipid metabolism using radioactive labelling with (1 - 14 C) acetate as a major precursor of lipid biosynthesis, showed that levels of radioactivity incorporation in total lipids of <b>Brassica</b> <b>napus</b> leaves were lowered by Cd doses. While they were enhanced in Brassica juncea treated plants.
