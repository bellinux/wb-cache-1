For it, the American flag was carried to many tribes, and their members were invited to sign a {{declaration}} of allegiance to the United States.The resulting large <b>bromide</b> <b>prints</b> were presentation photographs, such collections having been placed in several museums. Mostly, the subjects are Blackfeet, Cheyennes, Crows, Dakotas, and other northern plains tribes. Both the glass prints and film negatives of the Wanamaker Collection photographed by Dr. J. Dixon were donated to Indiana University's Mathers Museum of World Cultures. They are currently stored at the museum. Many of his more popular pieces are displayed at the museum in both a traveling exhibit and as reprints from the original glass slides and negatives. For information on the exhibit or collections please contact the curator of collections. Thousands of original glass plate negatives are also held in the Research Library of the American Museum of Natural History in New York.|$|R

40|$|Monarchs Of The East End’ was {{a special}} {{commission}} by the Rich Mix Cultural Foundation, London to be exhibited concurrently with the series titled ‘Empire Line,’ a product of studies on MA Fashion Photography at LCF. Both works formed a photographic installation of 22 images, exhibited at Maison Folie, Wazemmes, {{as part of a}} biannual arts and cultural event in Lille, France (14 October 2006 to 14 January 2007), and at Rich Mix, London (5 February 2007 to 29 April 2007). Being granted total creative direction enabled investigative methods of exploring new representations of indigenous and immigrant cultures of the East End district of London. An initial starting point was the traditional ‘Pearly Kings and Queens,’ with further inspiration from royal and imperial icons, patriotism, colonialism and commonwealth, criminal notoriety and the working classes. By integrating and subverting these symbolic references with stylistic elements originating from local street markets and vintage stores, I created a framework of characters bearing codes that conflicted and allied the notions of multiple and hybrid identities. The aesthetics explored in ‘Monarchs Of The East End,’ draw upon cultural diversity, Diaspora, race and national identity. A conceptual approach was measured and considered in retaining the drive and sedition of the ‘Empire Line’ series. Working in collaboration with Argento, Metro Imaging, enabled me to investigate innovative creative processes involved in producing digital black and white <b>bromide</b> <b>prints,</b> these large archival Silver Gelatin Prints were installed, untitled, in a manner that allowed the viewer to interact with the images and formulate an individual perspective. This preconceived approach demonstrated a sophisticated critical facility in relation to the project and its visual context in combination with the geographical locality of display...|$|R
40|$|Since {{completion}} of the report on our patient (A. P.) with the complex karyotype 46,XY, 4 r,E-, t(BqEq) described in the previous paper (pp. 235 - 239), a powerful new tool has become available to human cytogeneticists. When stained with some quinacrine dyes, specific human chromosome regions (ofwhich the largest is on theY chromosome) exhibit intense fluorescence (Zech, 1969; Pearson, Bobrow, and Vosa, 1970). In addition, subtle banding patterns appear (Caspersson et al, 1970 c) which are sufficiently characteristic to allow the identification of all chromosomes in the human complement ex-cept for Nos. 19 and 20. We describe here the identification of chromosomes in the B and E groups, based on studies of various cases, and apply the method to further defining the chromosomal abnormality in patient A. P. Methods Chromosome preparations from peripheral blood cultures were stained {{for about five minutes}} in a 0 5 % aqueous solution of quinacrine dihydrochloride (Atebrin, G. Gurr). After brief rinsing in tap water, the slides were dried and mounted in distilled water. The optical system has been described previously (Pearson et al, 1970). Photographs were taken on Kodak Pan-X 35 mm film. A double beam scanning microdensitometer * was used to obtain optical density profiles down the length of each chromosome. Scanning is directly from the photographic negative, eliminating the extra photo-graphic process necessitated by reflection scanning of <b>bromide</b> <b>prints.</b> In addition to the case under discussion, four other individuals studied have provided information relevant to the B and E group chromosomes. (1) Two cases of cri-du-chat syndrome, one confirmed as 5 p- by autoradio-graphy. (2) One subject with a familial abnormal band of intense fluorescence on one No. 4 chromosome. (3) A case with an E ring; on autoradiography, 12 / 15 informa...|$|R
50|$|In the {{original}} version of the printing process, carbon tissue (a temporary support sheet coated {{with a layer of}} gelatin mixed with a pigment—originally carbon black, from which the name derives) is bathed in a potassium dichromate sensitizing solution, dried, then exposed to strong ultraviolet light through a photographic negative, hardening the gelatin in proportion to the amount of light reaching it. The tissue is then developed by treatment with warm water, which dissolves the unhardened gelatin. The resulting pigment image is physically transferred to a final support surface, either directly or indirectly. In an important early 20th century variation of the process, known as carbro (carbon-bromide) printing, contact with a conventional silver <b>bromide</b> paper <b>print,</b> rather than exposure to light, was used to selectively harden the gelatin. A wide variety of colored pigments can be used instead of carbon black.|$|R

5000|$|Pitt {{was then}} {{employed}} by John Fairfax and Sons {{for their new}} paper, The Sun-Herald, where he produced a new science fiction comic strip, Captain Power, with the storyline provided by journalist Gerry Brown, the first issue appearing on 6 March 1949. Captain Power relied heavily on super-hero style costumes and gadgets for its impact. He continued to illustrate the strip until June 1950, when the pressure of other work saw him pass the strip onto Peter James. At the time Pitt commenced illustrating Yarmak-Jungle King comics, for Young's Merchandising, in November 1949, which he continued until June 1952. Yarmak was a Tarzan imitation, with the comic illustrated by Pitt and inked at various stages by Frank and Jimmy Ashley and Paul Wheelahan, with the stories written by Frank Ashley or Pitt's younger brother, Reginald. The quality of the comic varied from issue to issue {{given the number of}} people involved in its production. Together with his brother, Reginald, he attempted to get two strips, Lemmy Caution and Mr Midnight, syndicated in the United States, when this failed he joined Cleveland Press in 1956, where he created a new series of Silver Starr. During his time at Cleveland Press Pitt produced over 3,00 pulp fiction covers. The two brothers then commenced work on a new comic, Gully Foyle. Gully Foyle was conceived by Reginald, based on Alfred Bester's novel The Stars My Destination. [...] The book made an indelible impression on me for so many years, even though it would be 10 years before we finally got the chance to do it. Reginald Pitt [...] According to writer Kevin Patrick, Stan and Reginald's process involved producing black and white <b>bromide</b> photo <b>prints</b> that Stan then coloured by hand; these were then forwarded to Bester in the United States for approval. According to Patrick, the brothers completed several months of the comic strip for potential syndication but then faced a legal objection from the producers of a proposed film version of The Stars My Destination, who held exclusive adaptation rights to the book. Unable to sell Gully Foyle, the brothers stopped work on the project, with only a few pieces of their artwork eventually making it into the public domain, through a number of fan magazines. As a result of his artwork on the unpublished Gully Foyle, Pitt was approached by two US publishers to handle comic book work for them. Pitt then became the first Australian artist to have original material published in an American comic book, with the publication of The Witching Hour No. 14 (National Periodical Publications, Inc) and Boris Karloff - Tales of Mystery No. 33 (Western Publishing).|$|R
