40|$|Quantum dots (QDs), namely {{semiconductor}} nanocrystals, due {{to their}} particular optical and electronic properties, have growing applications in device technology, biotechnology and biomedical fields. Nevertheless, the possible threat to {{human health and the}} environment have attracted increasing attention as the production and applications of QDs increases rapidly while standard evaluation of safety lags. In the present study we performed proteomic analyses, by means of 2 D gel electrophoresis and Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS). We aimed to identify potential biomarkers of exposure to CdSe/ZnS quantum dots. The marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum exposed to 2. 5 nM QDs was used as a model system. Both 2 DE and SELDI showed the presence of differentially expressed proteins. By Principal Component Analysis (PCA) we were able to show that the differentially expressed proteins can discriminate between exposed and not exposed cells. Furthermore, a protein profile specific for exposed cells was obtained by SELDI analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first example of the application of SELDI technology to the analysis of microorganisms used as <b>biological</b> <b>sentinel</b> model of marine environmental pollution...|$|E
40|$|Seagrasses, marine {{flowering}} plants, {{have a long}} {{evolutionary history}} but are now challenged with rapid environmental changes {{as a result of}} coastal human population pressures. Seagrasses provide key ecological services, including organic carbon production and export, nutrient cycling, sediment stabilization, enhanced biodiversity, and trophic transfers to adjacent habitats in tropical and temperate regions. They also serve as “coastal canaries,” global <b>biological</b> <b>sentinels</b> of increasing anthropogenic influences in coastal ecosystems, with large-scale losses reported worldwide. Multiple stressors, including sediment and nutrient runoff, physical disturbance, invasive species, disease, commercial fishing practices, aquaculture, overgrazing, algal blooms, and global warming, cause seagrass declines at scales of square meters to hundreds of square kilometers. Reported seagrass losses have led to increased awareness of the need for seagrass protection, monitoring, management, and restoration. However, seagrass science, which has rapidly grown, is disconnected from public awareness of seagrasses, which has lagged behind awareness of other coastal ecosystems. There is a critical need for a targeted global conservation effort that includes a reduction of watershed nutrient and sediment inputs to seagrass habitats and a targeted educational program informing regulators and the public of the value of seagrass meadows...|$|R

40|$|Genotoxicity {{studies on}} toxic metals and their organic {{compounds}} are very important, especially {{so in the}} investigation of the effects of these compounds on the aquatic environments where they tend to accumulate. The use of endemic aquatic organisms as <b>biological</b> <b>sentinels</b> has proved useful to environmental monitoring. We assessed the mutagenic potential of tributyltin (TBT) and inorganic lead (PbII) using samples of the fish Hoplias malabaricus (commonly called traíra) using the comet assay and the piscine micronucleus and chromosome aberration tests. Eighteen H. malabaricus were acclimatized in three individual aquariums, each containing six fish, six fish being exposed to 0. 3 mg/g of body weight (bw) of TBT, six to 21 mg/g bw of PbII and six being used as controls. Exposure to TBT and PbII was achieved by feeding the fish every five days with Astyanax (a small fish {{that is part of the}} normal diet of H. malabaricus) which had been injected with solutions of TBT, PbII or with water (the control group). After two months the H. malabaricus were sacrificed and their peripheral blood collected and subjected to the comet and micronucleus assays, the chromosome aberration assay being conducted using kidney-tissue. Although the comet assay showed now mutagenic effects at the lead concentrations used but encountered results with TBT, the micronucleus and chromosome aberrations assays both indicated that TBT and PbII are potentially mutagenic (p < 0. 01), the micronucleus assay showing morphological alterations of the nucleus...|$|R
40|$|Understanding how biodiversity, {{ecosystem}} function and species conservation {{are affected by}} factors such as climate or land use change, disease and pollution is {{an important aspect of}} species conservation and a key focus of the field of Conservation Medicine. Mammals such as squirrels can be valuable <b>biological</b> <b>sentinels</b> for environmental pollution and the intention of this pilot project was to test a new, rapid technique that allows direct detection of mercury (Hg) in hair samples. Our aim was to establish, for the first time, if red squirrels in Europe show any indication of mercury pollution; and to compare levels from red squirrels in two rural UK (Arran and Brownsea Island) and one Polish city population (Warsaw). The latter is exposed to higher levels of Hg from coal-fired power plants. Total mercury levels ranged from 11. 1 to 801. 95 μg/kg. Contrary to our expectations, females from the Island of Arran had significantly higher Hg values than either males or females from the two other sites. Although the Isle of Arran was the only site where the difference between females and males was significant, our findings for both Poland and the UK suggest that mercury does not only accumulate in marine food chains and the arctic ecosystem, but is present in urban ecosystems and terrestrial woodlands. Data on trends to determine if Hg values are accumulating in arboreal mammals are completely lacking, and point to a need for a monitoring strategy of mercury levels and associated, potential health impacts in endangered species...|$|R
40|$|Seagrass are {{sensitive}} to environmental changes and can be monitored to detect human influences to coastal ecosystems. Measurable changes in seagrass abundance, distribution and condition provide resource managers with advance signs of deteriorating ecological conditions caused by poor water quality. For this reason, seagrasses are considered <b>biological</b> <b>sentinels.</b> The Great Barrier Reef's (GBR) inshore seagrasses are being monitored {{as part of the}} Reef Rescue Marine Monitoring Programme (MMP). Information from the program is being used to assess the long-term effectiveness of management actions in reversing decline in water quality of the GBR Marine Park. Since 2005, inshore seagrasses have been monitored across the six Natural Resource Management regions (NRMs) adjacent to the GBR World Heritage Area, south of Cooktown. Inshore seagrasses are currently monitored subregionally (habitats) at 30 sites using Seagrass-Watch as the basis. Results from the monitoring report annually on seagrass status and are incorporated into a report card for the health of the GBR. Seagrass community status is assessed using measures of seagrass abundance and reproductive effort, while epiphyte abundance and seagrass leaf tissue C:N:P elemental ratios (atomic) indicate the WQ environment. Modifiers such as edge mapping, in situ canopy temperature and in situ light are also used to interpret the data. The environmental status indicates progressive degraded water quality where plants were growing in low light environments, with relatively large phosphorus pool and excessive nitrogen pool. Further refinement of the indicators will enable greater use of these metrics for water quality management of the GBR...|$|R

40|$|Cytogenetics {{applied to}} {{domestic}} animals {{is a useful}} biotechnology to be applied in the genetic improvement of livestock. Indeed, {{it can be used}} to select reproducers free chromosome abnormalities which are responsible for abnormal body conformation (aneuploidy), lower fertility (balanced chromosome abnormalities) or sterility (sex chromosome abnormalities). Cytogenetics may also be applied to assess environmental pollution by studying animals living in hazardous areas and using them as <b>biological</b> indicators (<b>sentinels).</b> Chromosomes also represent optimal biological structures to study the evolution among related (bovids) and unrelated (bovidshumans) species, especially using comparative FISH-mapping which is one of the most powerful tools to establish the correct order of loci along chromosomes. These comparisons allow us to transfer useful information from richer genomes (human) to those of domestic animals. Moreover, the use of specific molecular markers and the FISH-technique on both mitotic and extended (fiber-FISH) chromosomes, has heralded a new era of cytogenetics, allowing swift extension of genetic physical maps, better anchoring of both linkage and RH-maps to specific chromosome regions, and use in a variety of applications (clinical cases, embryo and sperm analyses, evolution). In this study a brief review of these fields of the animal cytogenetics is presented...|$|R

40|$|The Niger Delta (Nigeria) is an {{exemplar of}} {{a legacy of}} {{environmental}} pollution. Limited knowledge on spatial and temporal pollutant distributions in the region highlights the need for biomonitoring approaches to study impacts on sentinel organisms. This study evaluated whether infrared (IR) spectroscopy and multivariate analysis could detect alterations in biomolecules in samples in differing exposure scenarios, i. e., spatial and temporal using African catfish (Heterobranchus bidorsalis) or water spinach (Ipomea aquatica). Significant spectral differences between tissues isolated from African catfish based on site or season were observed; {{in a region where}} fish appeared not to be present, water spinach was used as a surrogate sentinel organism. Using one-way ANOVA, the spectral categories were significant (P < 0. 0001). The applicability of IR spectroscopy to detect subtle changes in target <b>biological</b> molecules within <b>sentinel</b> organisms along with its low-cost yet high-throughput potential suggests that biospectroscopy permits real-time evaluation of environmental exposure effects...|$|R
