2500|$|Symmetric {{parabolic}} antennas {{produce a}} narrow [...] "pencil" [...] beam {{in both the}} X and Y dimensions and consequently have a higher gain. The NEXRAD Pulse-Doppler weather radar uses a symmetric antenna to perform detailed volumetric scans of the atmosphere. Spoiled parabolic antennas produce a narrow beam in one dimension and a relatively wide beam in the other. This feature is useful if target detection {{over a wide range}} of angles is more important than target location in three dimensions. [...] Most 2D surveillance radars use a spoiled parabolic antenna with a narrow azimuthal <b>beamwidth</b> and wide vertical <b>beamwidth.</b> This beam configuration allows the radar operator to detect an aircraft at a specific azimuth but at an indeterminate height. Conversely, so-called [...] "nodder" [...] height finding radars use a dish with a narrow vertical <b>beamwidth</b> and wide azimuthal <b>beamwidth</b> to detect an aircraft at a specific height but with low azimuthal precision.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{a method}} to broaden the <b>beamwidths</b> of a crossed dipole antenna is proposed. By {{introducing}} four parasitic strips around the crossed dipole antenna, the <b>beamwidths</b> of the crossed dipole antenna in the vertical plane are broadened effectively, making the patterns uniform over a wide frequency band. An L-band prototype, operating in the frequency range 1. 1 GHz to 1. 6 GHz, is fabricated and tested. The simulated and measured {{results show that the}} <b>beamwidths</b> at lower frequencies are broadened and uniform radiation patterns over the whole operating frequency band are obtained, making the crossed dipole suitable for wideband marine GPS (Global Positioning System) applications. 1...|$|R
40|$|An ultrawideband antenna {{based on}} a {{slotline}} feed structure, a bowtie horn, and a rolled edge termination was developed, analyzed, and measured. Empirical data showed that its <b>beamwidths</b> and bandwidth are dependent on its physical dimensions which are easily controllable by an antenna designer. Measured patterns of models with various radiation properties are shown to substantiate these design rules. A flat plateau-like main beam, low voltage standing-wave ratio (VSWR), the ability to produce both wide (60 deg) and narrow (30 deg) half-power <b>beamwidths,</b> low sidelobes and backlobe (40 - 50 dB down), low cross-polarized levels (20 - 25 dB down), and independent control of E- and H-plane <b>beamwidths</b> over an ultrawide bandwidth, say 2 - 18 GHz, {{are some of the}} strong points of this antenna type...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{reflector}} antennas {{are typically}} designed {{for up to}} + or - 20 <b>beamwidths</b> scan. An {{attempt was made to}} stretch this scan range to some + or - 300 <b>beamwidths.</b> Six single and dual reflector antennas were compared. It is found that a symmetrical parabolic reflector with f/D = 2 and a single circular waveguide feed has the minimum scan loss (only 0. 6 dB at Theta sub 0 = 8 deg, or a 114 <b>beamwidths</b> scan). The scan is achieved by tilting the parabolic reflector by an angle equal to the half-scan angle. The f/D may be shortened if a cluster 7 to 19 elements instead of one element is used for the feed. The cluster excitation is adjusted for each new beam scan direction to compensate for the imperfect field distribution over the reflector aperture. The antenna can be folded into a Cassegrain configuration except that, due to spillover and blockage considerations, the amount of folding achievable is small...|$|R
2500|$|For {{a typical}} 2 meter {{satellite}} dish operating on C band (4GHz), this formula gives a <b>beamwidth</b> of about 2.6°. [...] For the Arecibo antenna at 2.4GHz the <b>beamwidth</b> is 0.028°. [...] It {{can be seen}} that parabolic antennas can produce very narrow beams, and aiming them can be a problem. [...] Some parabolic dishes are equipped with a boresight so they can be aimed accurately at the other antenna.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the size}} of a horn (expressed in wavelengths) is increased, the phase error increases, giving the horn a wider {{radiation}} pattern. [...] Keeping the <b>beamwidth</b> narrow requires a longer horn (smaller flare angle) to keep the phase error constant. [...] The increasing phase error limits the aperture size of practical horns to about 15 wavelengths; larger apertures would require impractically long horns. [...] This limits the gain of practical horns to about 1000 (30 dBi) and the corresponding minimum <b>beamwidth</b> to about 5 - 10°.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{technique is}} described for finding the best focal surfaces for offset-fed dual-reflector antennas. A ray tracing procedure traces the loci of rays incident {{on the main}} reflector onto a plane or 'screen' situated perpendicular to a central ray of the antenna system. Given, then, by computer graphics, the best feed locations for azimuth and elevation plane patterns, an aperture diffraction method is used which can compute the sidelobe levels and <b>beamwidths</b> resulting from aperture phase errors on scanned or multibeam patterns.

30|$|For systems without REM, it is {{observed}} that increased beam directionality leads to linear improvement in RMSE values and localization performance. On the other hand, more directionality comes at a cost because it is achieved by adding antenna elements at the transmitter. It may not be feasible to fit the required number of antenna elements at the transmitter to reach a desired directionality. Furthermore, the cost of the transmitter grows with each additional antenna element. Thus, transmitter size constraints and affordability limit the achievable directionality. Additionally, it is seen that utilizing only the LOS path has much better localization performance than using only the NLOS paths while the addition of NLOS paths to the LOS path only provides modest improvements. The REM system RMSE curves reach a threshold where the RMSE does not increase with larger <b>beamwidths.</b> This occurs because REM provides knowledge of the scatterer locations. At smaller <b>beamwidths,</b> angles provide precise information and reduce the area of likely UE positions. Eventually, as the <b>beamwidths</b> increase, a threshold is reached where AOD/AOA measurements become less relevant and the angular uncertainty allows the spread of likely UE positions that are too disparate from the TOA measured path distances.|$|R
2500|$|The lowest full line on {{the graph}} is for Dolph-Chebyshev {{weighting}} which, as already mentioned, sets the narrowest lobe possible for a given sidelobe level. [...] So, from this plot, if a sidelobe level of -40dB is desired, the graph shows that the smallest achievable half-power <b>beamwidth</b> × bandwidth is 1.2. [...] Thus a chirp sweeping over a 20MHz frequency band will have a compressed pulsewidth of 60 nanoseconds (at least).|$|E

The antenna is a nonresonant, traveling-wave design, with a predicted impedance {{in the range from}} 50 Ω to 80 Ω. Calculations indicate that this antenna should have a gain of 15 dB with 3 dB <b>beamwidths</b> of 10 ° in the H plane and 64 ° in the E plane. Pattern measurements at 90 GHz support the theory. It should be possible to equalize the two <b>beamwidths</b> with a cylindrical lens.

2500|$|Downlink to Earth resumed on S-band, but the <b>beamwidth</b> of {{the high}} gain antenna in the S-band was not as narrow as in the X–band, so that the {{received}} downlink signal was much weaker, hence reducing the achievable data rate.

2500|$|In general, {{the more}} the {{sidelobe}} levels are lowered, the broader the main lobe will become. [...] However, the various windowing functions do perform differently from one other, with some giving main lobes which are unnecessarily broad for the sidelobe levels achieved.

2500|$|In May 1975, {{to address}} {{problems}} of <b>beamwidth</b> changing at different frequencies, D. Broadus [...] "Don" [...] Keele, Jr. of Electro-Voice introduced a hybrid horn with an exponential expansion rate near the throat {{followed by a}} conical expansion section and ending with a rapidly flaring flange at the mouth. The flange at the mouth solved some remaining problems with lobing at higher frequencies. Don Keele specified in one version of his design a wider horizontal flare for pattern control appropriate to public address purposes. Keele's paper set forth the relationships between mouth size, frequency and coverage angle, providing a basis for many future developments of horn design. One problem found with constant directivity horns is that the horizontal coverage pattern cannot be narrowed without making the vertical coverage pattern {{too small to be}} useful.|$|E
2500|$|The waves travel down a horn as spherical wavefronts, {{with their}} origin {{at the apex}} of the horn, a point called the phase center. [...] The pattern of {{electric}} and magnetic fields at the aperture plane {{at the mouth of the}} horn, which determines the radiation pattern, is a scaled-up reproduction of the fields in the waveguide. [...] Because the wavefronts are spherical, the phase increases smoothly from the edges of the aperture plane to the center, because of the difference in length of the center point and the edge points from the apex point. [...] The difference in phase between the center point and the edges is called the phase error. [...] This phase error, which increases with the flare angle, reduces the gain and increases the <b>beamwidth,</b> giving horns wider beamwidths than similar-sized plane-wave antennas such as parabolic dishes.|$|E
2500|$|Bowen and his {{counterpart}} at the Admiralty Signals Establishment (ASE), Canadian polymath Charles Wright, met at Bawdsey {{in the spring}} or summer of 1939 and considered {{the issue of a}} microwave airborne radar. Bowen agreed that the main problem with the range limits of the AI sets was the floodlight-like transmissions and that the easy way to fix this would be to narrow the beam, focussing the power into a smaller area. He concluded that a 10degree <b>beamwidth</b> would do the trick. Considering that the nose of an aircraft could hold a radar antenna about [...] across, an antenna with poles shorter than 15cm was desirable, and if that antenna had to be moved within the nose, 10cm (~3GHz) would be ideal. This strongly agreed with Wright's requirements for a shipboard system able to detect U-Boats while having an antenna small enough to be mounted on small escort vessels.|$|E

Nonspecular reflection phenomena in the Rayleigh angle are studied in detail. In this way, an explanation is given for the Rayleigh dip phenomenon for positive inhomogeneity factors and the related result of a reflection coefficient larger than unity when the sign of the inhomogeneity factor is reversed. In the limit of large <b>beamwidths,</b> the reflection coefficient predicted by the infinite plane inhomogeneous wave theory is obtained. These results are entirely consistent with the experimental work published by Deschamps [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 96, 2841 - 2848 (1994) ].

25|$|A {{parabolic}} antenna is an antenna {{that uses a}} parabolic reflector, a curved surface with the cross-sectional shape of a parabola, to direct the radio waves. The most common form is shaped like a dish and is popularly called a dish antenna or parabolic dish. The main advantage of a {{parabolic antenna}} {{is that it has}} high directivity. It functions similarly to a searchlight or flashlight reflector to direct the radio waves in a narrow beam, or receive radio waves from one particular direction only. Parabolic antennas have some of the highest gains, meaning that they can produce the narrowest <b>beamwidths,</b> of any antenna type. In order to achieve narrow <b>beamwidths,</b> the parabolic reflector must be much larger than the wavelength of the radio waves used, so parabolic antennas are used in the high frequency part of the radio spectrum, at UHF and microwave (SHF) frequencies, at which the wavelengths are small enough that conveniently-sized reflectors can be used.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{significantly}} improving {{the capacity of}} high-altitude platform (HAP) communications networks operating in the millimeter-wave bands is presented. It is shown how constellations of HAPs can share a common frequency allocation by exploiting the directionality of the user antenna. The system capacity of such constellations is critically affected by the minimum angular separation of the HAPs and the sidelobe level of the user antenna. For typical antenna <b>beamwidths</b> of approximately 5 /spl deg/ an inter-HAP spacing of 4 km is sufficient to deliver optimum performance. The aggregate bandwidth efficiency is evaluated, both theoretically using the Shannon equation, and using practical modulation and coding schemes, for multiple HAP configurations delivering either single or multiple cells. For the user antenna <b>beamwidths</b> used, it is shown that capacity increases are commensurate {{with the increase in}} the number of platforms, up to 10 HAPs. For increases beyond this the choice of constellation strategy becomes increasingly important...|$|R
