5|$|Every {{driver of}} a CMV is {{required}} {{to keep track of}} his/her time with a log <b>book</b> <b>or</b> an ELD. A log book is simply a notebook with a grid pattern on every page, dividing the 24-hour day into 15-minute (1/4-hour) segments. Drivers are required to make carbon copies of each page, so one page may be kept with the driver (to be produced upon inspection by DOT officers), and so the other copy may be sent to the driver's employer.|$|E

Local restaurant information and a combination pocket schedule and map may also be included. Sponsors often receive additional items such as T-shirts, pins or ribbons, as well as faster registration badge pick-up and on-site meals (some conventions provide a con suite with basic refreshments for all members). They may also be displayed prominently in convention publications.|$|E
5|$|FMCSA rules {{require that}} a log <b>book</b> (<b>or</b> ELD) must record for each change of duty status (e.g., {{the place of}} {{reporting}} for work, or starting to drive), {{the name of the}} city, town or village, with state abbreviation. If a change of duty status occurs at a location other than a city, the highway number and nearest milepost or the nearest two intersecting roadways followed by the name of the nearest city must be recorded. In addition to the time grid, a log book must record the date, total miles driven for the day, truck and trailer number, name of carrier, bill of lading number, and the driver's signature. The driver is required to retain a copy of each log page for the previous seven consecutive days which must be in his/her possession and available for inspection while on-duty.|$|E
5|$|Scientology is {{represented}} by {{a large number of}} independent associations or Vereine in Germany; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology Kirche Deutschland e.V. Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution), estimates that there are 4,000 Scientologists in Germany, down from earlier estimates of 5,000 to 6,000. The Church of Scientology reported around 30,000 members from the mid-1990s onwards; this number remained stable for many years. However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12,000 members. Discrepancies in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures, essentially including anyone who has purchased a <b>book</b> <b>or</b> participated in courses, regardless of their subsequent involvement. The number of contractually bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred.|$|E

5|$|The American Stud Book, the {{registration}} book for American Thoroughbreds, was not founded until 1873, much {{later than the}} General Stud Book, and the rules for registration required only that a horse have five generations of ancestors in the American Stud <b>Book</b> <b>or</b> other national stud books, unlike the General Stud Book rules. In addition, many breeding records were destroyed during the American Civil War, as fighting during that conflict took place in noted American Thoroughbred breeding centers. The result was that most American Thoroughbreds in 1913 were unable to show an unblemished pedigree according to the General Stud Book rules. Adding to the problem {{was the fact that}} American horses were beginning to win the big horse races in England, starting with Iroquois, who won the 1881 Epsom Derby.|$|E
5|$|The First Folio text of 1623 {{was based}} {{primarily}} on Q3, with clarifications and corrections possibly coming from a theatrical prompt <b>book</b> <b>or</b> Q1. Other Folio editions of the play were printed in 1632 (F2), 1664 (F3), and 1685 (F4). Modern versions—that take into account several of the Folios and Quartos—first appeared with Nicholas Rowe's 1709 edition, followed by Alexander Pope's 1723 version. Pope began a tradition of editing the play to add information such as stage directions missing in Q2 by locating them in Q1. This tradition continued late into the Romantic period. Fully annotated editions {{first appeared in the}} Victorian period and continue to be produced today, printing the text of the play with footnotes describing the sources and culture behind the play.|$|E
5|$|There are {{at least}} five {{competing}} theories about the manuscript's place of origin and time of completion. First, the <b>book,</b> <b>or</b> perhaps just the text, may have been created at Iona, then brought to Kells, where the illuminations were perhaps added, and never finished. Second, the book may have been produced entirely at Iona. Third, the manuscript may have been produced entirely in the scriptorium at Kells. Fourth, {{it may have been}} produced in the north of England, perhaps at Lindisfarne, then brought to Iona and from there to Kells. Finally, {{it may have been the}} product of an unknown monastery in Pictish Scotland, though there is no actual evidence for this theory, especially considering the absence of any surviving manuscript from Pictland. Although the question of the exact location of the book's production will probably never be answered conclusively, the first theory, that it was begun at Iona and continued at Kells, is widely accepted. Regardless of which theory is true, it is certain that the Book of Kells was produced by Columban monks closely associated with the community at Iona.|$|E
