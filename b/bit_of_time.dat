25|$|Charles A. Lindbergh, {{arguably the}} world's most famous aviator, spent quite a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in Hempstead {{both before and}} after his epic solo flight from nearby Roosevelt Field to Le Bourget Field in Paris, France on May 20, 1927. While living here, Christopher Morley was so enamored with the place that on the three {{hundredth}} anniversary of its founding he wrote a beautiful essay in tribute. His first novel, Parnassus on Wheels, was written on a kitchen table at his Oak Street, Hempstead home in 1917. In 1704 the first stage coach on Long Island stopped to water its horses here.|$|E
25|$|The {{transformation}} from the youth {{team to the}} national side, however, took a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> {{and it was not}} until the 1994–95 season that he got his chance in the national colours. This delay was partly because during the period 90–94 Bangladesh was mainly involved with One-Day Cricket while Jawed's batting technique is always more suitable for the longer version. Jawed was part of the team that won the ICC Trophy in 1997. However, he spent most of the tournament as a reserve player, as the coach Gordon Greenidge decided to push hard hitting middle-order bat Naimur Rahman to the opening position.|$|E
25|$|Mandžukić {{first began}} the season slowly, having small issues {{adjusting}} to new Bayern coach Pep Guardiola's system. Guardiola changed Bayern's formation from the 4–2–3–1 {{they had used}} previously under Jupp Heynckes to a new 4–1–4–1 style. While it took a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to adjust, Mandžukić regained his form nonetheless in time for league play. He opened the new season in the Bundesliga by scoring two goals in two league appearances. Mandžukić scored his first Champions League goal of the season when Bayern Munich began the defence of their Champions League title against CSKA Moscow with a 3–0 victory at the Allianz Arena. He headed the only goal as Bayern defeated a valiant FC Viktoria Plzeň in November {{to move into the}} knockout stages with a record-equalling ninth successive UEFA Champions League win. Mandžukić scored his tenth goal of the new Bundesliga season in a December match against Hamburger SV.|$|E

25|$|The French Army {{preferred}} bag {{charges for}} its ammunition because the brass cartridge cases {{used by the}} Mle 1915 were expensive to produce, both in money and {{in the amount of}} brass required. This became a real problem during the war given the vast number of shells expended and Schneider was asked to redesign the gun to use a deBange obdurator and allow it to use bagged powder. Schneider agreed and adapted the breech of the Canon de 155mm GPF to fit the barrel of the Mle 1915, but this took quite a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> due to the press of existing work and the new Mle 1917 howitzer didn't enter service until late 1916. The main difference between the Mle 1915 and 1917 was in the breech. Many guns had their loading trays removed because it slowed down the rate of fire; a portable shell tray was used instead by the loaders.|$|E
25|$|The Jesuits {{arrived in}} the Viceroyalty of Peru by 1571; it was a key area of Spanish empire, with not only dense {{indigenous}} populations but also huge deposits of silver at Potosí. A major figure in {{the first wave of}} Jesuits was José de Acosta (1540–1600), whose book Historia natural y moral de las Indias (1590) introduced Europeans to Spain's American empire via fluid prose and keen observation and explanation, based on fifteen years in Peru and a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in New Spain (Mexico). Viceroy of Peru Don Francisco de Toledo urged the Jesuits to evangelize the indigenous peoples of Peru, wanting to put them in charge of parishes, but Acosta adhered to the Jesuit position that they were not subject to the jurisdiction of bishops and to catechize in Indian parishes would bring them into conflict with the bishops. For that reason, the Jesuits in Peru focused on education of elite men rather than the indigenous populations.|$|E

500|$|Risk, {{released}} in August 1999, {{was a critical}} and commercial failure and led to backlash from many longtime fans. Although its two predecessors incorporated rock elements alongside a more traditional heavy metal sound, Risk was virtually devoid of metal. About the band's musical direction, Dave Mustaine said: [...] "We hit the nadir of our career with Risk, and I vowed after {{that we were going}} to get back to our roots. It took a little <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to do that." [...] Despite this, Risk was certified gold in the United States. The album's lead single, [...] "Crush 'Em", appeared on the soundtrack for [...] and was used as an entrance theme for NHL hockey games and professional wrestling events.|$|E

Elliot praised the CG cutscenes, but said that [...] "the tired, boxy side streets feel unfinished." [...] However, he further said that the expansive nature of environments balanced this issue out. The environments were praised by Famitsu, which stated that due to the expansive nature of the environments {{and the lack of}} hints concerning quests, new players might take a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> getting used to it. It also generally called the game [...] "quite nice".|$|E

500|$|In 1994, {{suspicion}} {{of foul play}} by the Benetton team (who were eventually found to {{have been responsible for}} some technical violations {{over the course of the}} season) was said to have troubled Ayrton Senna that season. For example, in the words of his then teammate, Damon Hill, Senna had chosen to spend a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> at the first corner of the Aida circuit following his retirement from the Pacific Grand Prix. After listening to Schumacher's Benetton B194 as it went past, Senna [...] "concluded that there was, what he regarded, as unusual noises from the engine". The FIA subsequently issued a press release setting out action that it required teams to take prior to the German Grand Prix, given that various cars were found to have an advanced engine management systems emulating launch and traction control.|$|E
500|$|Forty-five drivers {{attempted}} to qualify; due to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Keselowski clinched his first pole {{position in the}} Sprint Cup Series, {{with a time of}} 28.515. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Bowyer. Stewart qualified third, Jamie McMurray took fourth, and Juan Pablo Montoya started fifth. Johnson, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified twenty-fifth, while Harvick was scored in twenty-seventh. The two drivers who failed to qualify for the race were Jeff Green and Johnny Sauter. Once qualifying concluded Keselowski said, [...] "I felt I got a shot at the pole before I qualified but you never really know. When I ran the lap I knew I gave up a little <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> {{right in the middle of}} both corners but I had a plan going into it and stuck to it and it worked.

500|$|The group {{employed}} Brian Eno and his assisting partner Mark [...] "Flood" [...] Ellis—both of whom {{worked on}} Achtung Baby—to produce the sessions; long-time Eno collaborator Daniel Lanois was busy promoting his solo album and was unavailable. Similar to the Achtung Baby sessions, Eno worked two-week shifts. The group often gave him in-progress songs to adjust {{and to which}} he could add his own personality. Initially, the band {{did not have a}} clear plan for how they would release the material being written. At the time, Clayton said, [...] "I don't know if what we're doing here is the next U2 album or a bunch of rough sketches that in two years will turn into the demos for the next U2 album." [...] The Edge was a proponent of making an EP of new material to promote the upcoming leg of the tour, describing his mentality as thus: [...] "We've got a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> off. We've got some ideas hanging around from the last record, let's do an EP, maybe four new songs to spice the next phase of the tour up a bit. It'll be a fan thing. It'll be cool." ...|$|E

500|$|Aaron Riccio of Slant Magazine also rated {{it three}} out of four stars, stated [...] "Strike Back isn't {{brilliant}} television, but it's plenty entertaining, and by fitting the action of 24 with the grit of The Unit (and the nudity of Cinemax), it fills a [...]22 caliber hole in American television." [...] However Riccio added that the downside to the series was that [...] "not enough time is given over to the fractious [...] "buddy-cop" [...] relationship between the two main characters, Scott and Stonebridge, whereas quite a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> is spent with the villains." [...] Hank Stuever of The Washington Post called it [...] "surprisingly stylish and addictive," [...] adding [...] "Fans of [...] "24," [...] which bowed last year, still ask me how to fill that void. They want just enough intelligence-agency hooey to make the unbelievable seem somewhat real. Until [...] "Strike Back," [...] I didn't have a good answer." [...] Stuever lauded Scott and Stapleton's portrayal, stating he is [...] "the real find here, a thoroughly unlikable loser" [...] who [...] "saves the show from a dour sense of duty," [...] adding that Staplton [...] "seems to have been created in a laboratory experiment that grafted Ewan McGregor's personality and smile onto Hugh Jackman's body — with more than adequate results." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-2010, {{the entire}} group were in Los Angeles for a birthday, where Manson {{suggested}} they book a studio and spend time writing. Along with Garbage's long time engineer and Manson's husband Billy Bush, the band, as Bush described, [...] "hung out for a couple weeks, drank some wine and played a bunch of music”. Three or four song ideas came together during this time. [...] "But we didn't go right into making-a-record mode", Erikson recalled. [...] "It took a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> for us {{to realize that we}} were going to make an album." [...] Erikson described reconvening as a piecemeal process, saying that it informally began with the first phone conversations among them since their hiatus, as they discussed playing together again. After convening, and composing and performing song ideas together through multiple sessions, they then decided to move forward with the band and embark on a full-length album. The project took off in February 2011, when Manson called Vig proposing to reunite the band and try making a new record. Manson convoked the group out of an eagerness [...] "to make loud music again". [...] "I'm a loud person", she proclaimed; [...] "I love noise and aggression. I crave contact. I needed to make that connection again. I think we all did. To get something back up when there was absolutely no momentum took a Herculean effort on everybody's part. It's like pulling yourself out of mud. Even to stand back up and say 'we're going to take another swing at this' was a scary feeling, and I'm proud of us for trying. It's much easier to stay at home.” ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E
