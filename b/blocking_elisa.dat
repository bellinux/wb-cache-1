40|$|A {{blocking}} {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) {{has been}} adapted to detect specific antibodies in bovine sera to respiratory syncytial virus using a horseradish peroxidase-labeled monclonal antibody to the fusion protein of the virus. This assay plus an indirect <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> and indirect ELISA were used to detect antibodies to the bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) in 159 field-origin bovine sera. Results of these assays were compared with serum antibody titers measured by the serum neutralization (SN) test. Over a 56 -day period, the mean neutralization titers and the mean delta absorbance values for the <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA,</b> on the same sera, showed similar declines. However, the calculated correlation coefficients between mean SN titer and mean absorbance value for the <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> of the individual sera ranged from - 0. 2 to - 0. 5 depending on the source of sera. Similar values were obtained whether using crude or purified viral antigen in the assays. Corresponding calculated correlation coefficients were generally higher for the indirect <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> or indirect ELISA than for the <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA.</b> The <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> was between 70 and 64 % as sensitive as the serum neutralization test with a specificity of 100 or 90 % using the crude and purified viral antigen, respectively. The indirect <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> and indirect ELISA had similar calculated sensitivities and specificities. The <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> was faster to run than either of the other ELISA’s or the neutralization test. Further, nonspecific background absorbance was obviated because the <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> detects antibodies to 1 specific viral protein, the fusion protein. These {{studies suggest that the}} <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> should be useful as a serological test for BRSV antibodies...|$|E
40|$|A <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> {{targeting}} an immunodominant West Nile epitope on the West Nile Virus NS 1 protein {{was assessed}} {{for the detection}} of West Nile-specific antibodies in blood samples collected from 584 sentinel chickens and 238 wild birds collected in-New Jersey from May-December 2000. Ten mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) experimentally infected with West Nile virus and six uninfected controls were also tested. The ELISA proved specific in detecting WNV antibodies in 9 / 10 chickens and 4 / 4 wild birds previously confirmed as positive by Plaque Reduction Neutralization test (PRNT) at the Center for Disease Control, Division of Vector Borne Diseases, Fort Collins, CO, USA (CDC). Nine out of the ten experimentally infected mallard ducks also tested positive for WN antibodies in the <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA,</b> while 6 / 6 uninfected controls did not. Additionally, 1705 wild birds, collected in New Jersey from December 2000 -November 2001 and Long Island, New York between November 1999 and August 2001 were also tested for WN antibodies by the <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA.</b> These tests identified 30 positive specimens, 12 of which had formalin-fixed tissues available to allow detection of WN specific viral antigen in various tissues by WNV-specific immunohistochemistry. Our results indicate that rapid and specific detection of antibodies to WN virus in sera from a range of avian species by <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> is an effective strategy for WN Virus surveillance in avian hosts. In combination with detection of WN-specific antigens in tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC) the <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> will also be useful for confirming WN infection in diseased birds...|$|E

40|$|Antibodies in porcine sera against {{glycoprotein}} E (gE) of pseudorabies virus (PRV) {{are usually}} measured in blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) {{with one or}} two murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against gE. Our aim was to develop a confirmation assay which is based on another principle and which is able to detect antibodies directed against most potential binding sites on gE with high specificity. Therefore, we developed an indirect double-antibody sandwich assay (IDAS) using recombinant gE expressed by baculovirus (BacgE 960). A fragment of the gE gene consisting of nucleotide positions + 60 to + 1020 of gE, coding for the major antigenic sites of gE but not the transmembrane region, was cloned behind the signal sequence of PRV gG and the p 10 promoter in a baculovirus vector. Immunoblot analysis showed that the expressed protein reacted with MAbs directed against five of the six antigenic sites on gE. Although the conformation of some antigenic sites, notably antigenic sites E and C, was not identical to their natural conformation, the expressed protein bound gE-specific antibodies in porcine sera in Western blots (immunoblots) and ELISAs. For the IDAS, a coating MAb directed against the nonimmunodominant antigenic site A on gE was chosen. A major obstacle in binding ELISAs, such as the IDAS, appeared to be the high nonspecific binding activity observed in porcine sera. As a result, sera could be tested only in relatively high dilutions in the BacgE 960 IDAS, in contrast to the testing of sera in <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISAs.</b> The sensitivity and specificity of the newly developed BacgE 960 IDAS were evaluated and compared with those of five commercially available <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISAs</b> by using several sets of sera of known PRV disease history. The BacgE 960 IDAS assay had a high diagnostic specificity and a moderate sensitivity. The five <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISAs</b> differed remarkably in sensitivity and specificity, thereby illustrating the need for standardization and confirmation. We conclude that the BacgE 960 IDAS is a useful and specific additional (confirmatory) test for the detection of antibodies to gE...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Lawsonia intracellularis is {{a common}} cause of chronic {{diarrhoea}} and poor performance in young growing pigs. Diagnosis of this obligate intracellular bacterium {{is based on the}} demonstration of the microbe or microbial DNA in tissue specimens or faecal samples, or the demonstration of L. intracellularis -specific antibodies in sera. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate a <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> in the detection of serum antibodies to L. intracellularis, by comparison to the previously widely used immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Methods Sera were collected from 176 pigs aged 8 - 12 weeks originating from 24 herds with or without problems with diarrhoea and poor performance in young growing pigs. Sera were analyzed by the <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> and by IFAT. Bayesian modelling techniques were used to account for the absence of a gold standard test and the results of the <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> was modelled against the IFAT test with a " 2 dependent tests, 2 populations, no gold standard" model. Results At the finally selected cut-off value of percent inhibition (PI) 35, the diagnostic sensitivity of the <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> was 72 % and the diagnostic specificity was 93 %. The positive predictive value was 0. 82 and the negative predictive value was 0. 89, at the observed prevalence of 33. 5 %. Conclusion The sensitivity and specificity as evaluated by Bayesian statistic techniques differed from that previously reported. Properties of diagnostic tests may well vary between countries, laboratories and among populations of animals. In the absence of a true gold standard, the importance of validating new methods by appropriate statistical methods and with respect to the target population must be emphasized. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the seroprevalence and serotype-specificity of the circulating antibodies against Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV) in cattle in K asese and Bushenyi districts in Uganda. A total of 309 serum samples were collected and tested for antibodies against Non-Structural (NS) and Structural Proteins (SP) using Ceditest® FMDV-NS and C editest® FMDV type O test kits. Seroprevalences were much higher in Kasese in both tests (61 and 43 %, respectively) than in Bushenyi (3 and 4 %, respectively). A high proportion of sera, that tested positive in the NSP test, were subjected to seven serotype specific <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISAs</b> for antibodies against the seven FMDV serotypes (O, A, C, Asia 1, SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3).

40|$|A {{collaborative}} exercise, {{supervised by}} the World Health Organisation, {{was set up}} to compare ELISAs used for the serological detection of Salmonella enteritica serotype Enteritidis in chickens. The aim was to ascertain how far agreement could be reached on the interpretation of optical density readings for high titre, intermediate titre and low titre sera. Two sets of sera were sent to 14 participants. The first set compared high, medium and low titre sera raised in specified-pathogen-free and commercial broiler breeder chickens. The second set comprised 20 sera of different antibody titres raised in commercial birds reared under laboratory conditions and sent blind. Both indirect and double-antibody sandwich <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISAs</b> were used with a number of different detecting antigens. With a few exceptions good agreement was reached on the interpretation of results obtained from high and low titre sera from the optical density obtained with a single serum dilution. Differences were observed in the interpretation of medium titre sera. The results suggested that most ELISAs produce reasonably comparable results and that practical problems may arise from interpretation of the results mainly {{as a result of the}} choice of the criteria used for differentiating sera obtained from infected and uninfected chickens.

40|$|In Australia, {{infection}} of horses with the West Nile virus (WNV) or Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) occasionally results in severe neurological disease that cannot be clinically differentiated. Confirmatory serological tests to detect antibody specific for MVEV or WNV in horses are often hampered by cross-reactive antibodies induced to conserved epitopes {{on the envelope}} (E) protein. This study utilized bacterially expressed recombinant antigens derived from domain III of the E protein (rE-DIII) of MVEV and WNV, respectively, to determine whether these subunit antigens provided specific diagnostic markers of infection with these two viruses. When a panel of 130 serum samples, from horses with known flavivirus infection status, was tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using rE-DIII antigens, a differential diagnosis of MVEV or WNV was achieved for most samples. Time-point samples from horses exposed to flavivirus infection during the 2011 outbreak of equine encephalitis in south-eastern Australia also indicated that the rE-DIII antigens were capable of detecting and differentiating MVEV and WNV infection in convalescent sera with similar sensitivity and specificity to virus neutralization tests and <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISAs.</b> Overall, {{these results indicate that}} the rE-DIII is a suitable antigen for use in rapid immunoassays for confirming MVEV and WNV infections in horses in the Australian context and warrant further assessment on sensitive, high-throughput serological platforms such as multiplex immune assays...|$|R
40|$|By using a {{monoclonal}} antibody directed against an epitope located on glycoprotein B of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV 1), a simple, convenient blocking {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) which combines a high sensitivity with a low false-positive rate has been developed. The test can be performed at low variance on undiluted bovine serum samples. The epitope on glycoprotein B appears to be conserved, because it could be detected by immunostaining in all of 160 BHV 1 isolates originating from 10 countries. In testing 215 anti-BHV 1 antibody-negative and 179 anti-BHV 1 antibody-positive serum samples, specificity and sensitivity were 0. 96 and 0. 99, respectively. This <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> is superior to a commercially available indirect ELISA and to the 24 -h virus neutralization test in detecting low antibody levels in serum. In addition, this <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> is able to detect specific antibodies in serum as early as 7 days postinfection.

40|$|The {{program for}} the {{eradication}} of Salmonella enteritidis from chickens in The Netherlands is based on bacteriological examination of breeding flocks. There is a great need for a specific and sensitive serological screening test. For that purpose, we developed four different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), i. e., an indirect ELISA with S. enteritidis flagellin, an indirect ELISA with S. enteritidis lipopolysaccharide, a double-antibody sandwich <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> that uses monoclonal antibodies against S. enteritidis flagellin (GM-DAS <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA),</b> and a double-antibody sandwich ELISA that uses monoclonal antibodies against S. enteritidis lipopolysaccharide.

40|$|Caprine {{herpesvirus}} 1 (CpHV- 1) {{is responsible}} of a systemic disease in kids and genital diseases inducing abortions in adult goats. In Europe, CpHV- 1 is widespread in Mediterranean {{countries such as}} Greece, Italy and Spain. As France is geographically close to these countries, a survey was conducted to investigate the presence of CpHV- 1 in goats in a Mediterranean department (Corse-du-Sud) and in continental departments (Dordogne and Vendee) of this country. Taking into account the close antigenic and genetic relationships between bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV- 1) and CpHV- 1, the serological detection was performed by using BoHV- 1 glycoproteins B (gB) and E (gE) blocking ELISAs. The analysis of 2548 serum samples in a BoHV- 1 gB <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> revealed that a ruminant alphaherpesvirus infection related to BoHV- 1 was widespread in Corse-du-Sud whereas no positive animals was detected in Dordogne and Vendee. Furthermore, the specificity and {{the sensitivity of the}} BoHV- 1 gB <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> to detect a BoHV- 1 related infection in goats were evaluated. A subsequent analysis by a BoHV- 1 gE <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> demonstrated that 22. 6 % of gB-positive serum samples were also gE-positive. Cross-seroneutralisation assays afforded the unambiguous identification of antibodies against CpHV- 1 in gB-positive goats. The likely presence of CpHV- 1 in Corse-du-Sud supported by a high seroprevalence (61. 9 %) in all investigated flocks extends the number of countries infected with CpHV- 1.

40|$|International audienceA new {{chimeric}} pestivirus “CP 7 _E 1 E 2 alf_TLA”, {{based on}} the infectious cDNA of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) strain CP 7, was constructed. The substitution of BVDV E 1 and E 2 with the respective proteins of classical swine fever (CSF) strain Alfort 187 allows an optimal heterodimerization of E 1 and E 2 in the chimeric virus, which is beneficial for efficient and authentic virus assembly and growth. In addition, for implementation of E 2 -based marker diagnostics, the previously described antigenic CSFV-specific TAVSPTTLR-epitope was exchanged with the corresponding E 2 -epitope of BVDV strain CP 7. Recombinant virus CP 7 _E 1 E 2 alf_TLA displayed a growth defect, and was not reacting with monoclonal antibodies used in commercial E 2 antibody <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISAs.</b> Therefore, efficacy as well as marker properties of CP 7 _E 1 E 2 alf_TLA were investigated in an animal experiment with both a high dose and a low dose vaccine preparation. All CP 7 _E 1 E 2 alf_TLA-vaccinated animals seroconverted until day 14 post challenge infection with neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, at the day of challenge infection CP 7 _E 1 E 2 alf_TLA-immunised animals showed distinct lower ELISA-values in a commercial CSFV-E 2 -antibody test {{in comparison to the}} C-strain vaccinated controls. However, E 2 -ELISA reactivity as well as neutralizing titres were directly connected to the dosage used for vaccination, and only the low dose group had E 2 -ELISA values below threshold until challenge infection. Following challenge infection with highly virulent CSFV-strain Koslov, all vaccinees were protected, however, short-term fever episodes and very limited CSFV-genome detection with very low copy numbers could be observed. In conclusion, manipulation of the TAVSPTTLR-epitope within the tested chimeric virus resulted in an slightly reduced efficacy, but the E 2 -marker properties unexpectedly did not allow a clear differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals in some cases...|$|R

Vaccinal antibodies produced with the subunit vaccine Pneumequine® cannot however be reliably distinguished, by the <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA,</b> from antibodies produced in natural infections or following the use of whole virus vaccines. Possibly, future genetically engineered vaccines which incorporate only the surface glycoproteins will stimulate the production of antibodies which will not be detected and allow the use of the test to differentiate horses naturally infected from those vaccinated with engineered vaccines. In a structured serological survey of Thoroughbred horses in New Zealand it was found that about 70 % of adult (> 24 months old) horses have specific EHV- 1 antibodies and are therefore assumed to be latently infected with the virus. The prevalence increased with age, with 29 % of 6 - 12 month old and 48 % of 13 - 24 month old horses having specific EHV- 1 antibodies. Gender was found to have a minor effect on the prevalence of specific antibodies, with female horses having slightly higher prevalence than males. In the survey, samples from two different years were tested. There was a slightly higher prevalence in 1995 than 1993, which is believed to be due to an increase in infection particularly in young horses in that year. In a group of young horses sampled monthly from birth, no clinical signs of respiratory disease were seen but four of the nine foals showed seroconversion to EHV- 1 around the time of weaning. In an investigation of an outbreak of EHV- 1 abortion on a Thoroughbred stud, high levels of specific EHV- 1 antibody were found in sera from four of the six mares that aborted. The <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> test would have had considerable diagnostic value following the first abortions however, high levels of specific antibody were still present in some of the mares a year later. It was not possible to determine whether this was due to the persistence of these antibodies or whether it was due to reinfection or reactivation of latent virus. With tissue from the aborted foetuses it was possible to evaluate the ability of the EHV- 1 specific monoclonal antibody, which forms the basis of the <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> test, to detect viral antigen in formalin-fixed tissue. After finding a suitable pretreatment involving microwave irradiation and trypsinisation it was possible to 'unmask' and visualise viral antigen in formalin-fixed tissue using the monoclonal antibody and an immunoperoxidase detection system. This provides a useful tool for the direct diagnosis of infection due to EHV- 1 in tissue without the need for virus isolation and subsequent typing. The specific <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> and its associated monoclonal antibody, has proven useful both in the diagnosis of infection due to EHV- 1 and in epidemiological studies of the virus. Use of the test in other countries, particularly where the incidence of abortion and neurological disease are higher than in New Zealand, would yield valuable information on the prevalence of the virus in different situations. In addition, the test has application as a management tool on a horse stud for the segregation of horses latently infected with EHV- 1 and those naïve to the virus as a control measure for the serious sequelae of abortion and neurological disease...|$|E
40|$|A {{recent study}} {{reported}} neutralizing antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV) in horses from four ranches of southern Pantanal. To extend that study, a serosurvey for WNV and 11 Brazilian flaviviruses {{was conducted with}} 760 equines, 238 sheep and 61 caimans from 17 local cattle ranches. Among the tested equines, 32 were collected from a ranch where a neurologic disorder outbreak had been recently reported. The sera were initially screened by using a <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> and then titrated by 90 % plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT 90) for 12 flaviviruses. Employing the criterion of 4 -fold greater titer, 78 (10. 3 %) equines were seropositive for Ilheus virus, 59 (7. 8 %) for Saint Louis encephalitis virus, 24 (3. 2 %) for WNV, two (0. 3 %) for Cacipacore virus and one (0. 1 %) for Rocio virus. No serological evidence was found linking the neurological disease that affected local equines to WNV. All caimans and sheep were negative by <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> for flaviviruses. There were no seropositive equines for Bussuquara, Iguape, Yellow fever and all four Dengue virus serotypes.

40|$|A new {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respiratory syncytial virus antigen {{detection kit}} (Ortho Diagnostics, Inc., Raritan, N. J.) was compared with virus culture and with the indirect fluorescent antibody test (FAT) by using fresh nasal washings from children with suspected respiratory syncytial virus infection. Both uncentrifuged nasal washings and pellets from centrifuged split specimens were examined by ELISA. The ELISA was considered positive when the optical density was greater than the mean background optical density plus 0. 15. Specimens positive by ELISA but negative by culture and FAT were reexamined in an <b>ELISA</b> <b>blocking</b> assay. Of 337 uncentrifuged specimens, 124 (37 %) were positive by culture, 107 (32 %) were positive by FAT, and 166 (49 %) were positive by <b>ELISA.</b> <b>Blocking</b> assays showed that 21 of 30 (70 %) of the seemingly false-positive ELISA tests were, in fact, true-positives and that the cultures and FATs were falsely negative. A patient specimen was considered positive when it was positive by virus culture, FAT, or blocking assay. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of the ELISA test were 88, 94, and 95 %, respectively. Centrifugation of nasal washings raised the sensitivity from 88 to 92 % but reduced the specificity from 94 to 81 %. We conclude that the Ortho ELISA test of uncentrifuged nasal washings is more sensitive than virus culture or indirect FAT and is highly specific...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background To {{study the}} role of African buffalos (Syncerus caffer) in the {{maintenance}} of foot-and-mouth disease in Uganda, serum samples were collected from 207 African buffalos, 21 impalas (Aepyceros melampus), 1 giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), 1 common eland (Taurotragus oryx), 7 hartebeests (Alcelaphus buselaphus) and 5 waterbucks (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) from four major National Parks in Uganda between 2005 and 2008. Serum samples were screened to detect antibodies against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) non-structural proteins (NSP) using the Ceditest ® FMDV NS <b>ELISA.</b> Solid Phase <b>Blocking</b> <b>ELISAs</b> (SPBE) {{were used to determine}} the serotype-specificity of antibodies against the seven serotypes of FMDV among the positive samples. Virus isolation and sequencing were undertaken to identify circulating viruses and determine relatedness between them. Results Among the buffalo samples tested, 85 % (95 % CI = 80 - 90 %) were positive for antibodies against FMDV non-structural proteins while one hartebeest sample out of seven (14. 3 %; 95 % CI = - 11. 6 - 40. 2 %) was the only positive from 35 other wildlife samples from a variety of different species. In the buffalo, high serotype-specific antibody titres (≥ 80) were found against serotypes O (7 / 27 samples), SAT 1 (23 / 29 samples), SAT 2 (18 / 32 samples) and SAT 3 (16 / 30 samples). Among the samples titrated for antibodies against the four serotypes O, SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3, 17 / 22 (77 %; CI = 59. 4 - 94. 6 %) had high titres against at least two serotypes. FMDV isolates of serotypes SAT 1 (1 sample) and SAT 2 (2 samples) were obtained from buffalo probang samples collected in Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP) in 2007. Sequence analysis and comparison of VP 1 coding sequences showed that the SAT 1 isolate belonged to topotype IV while the SAT 2 isolates belonged to different lineages within the East African topotype X. Conclusions Consistent detection of high antibody titres in buffalos supports the view that African buffalos {{play an important role in}} the maintenance of FMDV infection within National Parks in Uganda. Both SAT 1 and SAT 2 viruses were isolated, and serological data indicate that it is also likely that FMDV serotypes O and SAT 3 may be present in the buffalo population. Detailed studies should be undertaken to define further {{the role of}} wildlife in the epidemiology of FMDV in East Africa. </p...|$|R
40|$|Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (HS), an endemic {{bacterial}} disease, {{is caused}} by specific serotypes of Pasteurella multocida {{and is one of}} the major economic diseases of bovines in south-east Asia including India. Sero-monitoring of vaccinal antibodies and definitive diagnosis of the disease is of utmost importance to combat the economic losses and ELISA system has remained the test of preference due to its versatility. Skimmed milk powder (SMP) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) respectively in concentration of 2, 3, 4 % and 0. 5, 1. 0 % have been compared as <b>blocking</b> reagents in <b>ELISA</b> for detection of antibodies against P. multocida.

40|$|Objective To isolate human {{antibodies}} against hepatitis E {{virus from}} phage display library {{by a new}} method of panning phage antibody library based on immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Methods Phage antibody library was allowed to mix with hex-His tagged expressed HEV specific antigen, NE 2, in solution for adequate binding before affinity resin for hex-His was added. The non-specific phage antibodies were removed by extensive washing and the specific bound phage antibodies could then be eluted to infect TG 1 or repeat the binding process for subsequent rounds of purification. The specificity of the selected human antibodies were tested by antigen competitive ELISA, human sera <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA,</b> scFv expression, and sequence analysis. Results His-NE 2 specific recombinant phages were successfully enriched after panning procedure. Two individual phage clones, 126 and 138, showed 50 % inhibition in NE 2 antigen competition ELISA and obvious blocking effect by HEV positive serum in <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA.</b> Soluble scFv of 126, 138 bound to NE 2 specifically. Conclusion Two specific human phage antibodies against hepatitis E virus (HEV) from phage display library were isolated by immobilized metal affinity chromatography.

40|$|Antibody-induced {{conformational}} {{changes of}} proteins have been recently frequently suggested {{to explain a}} variety of observations. In spite of the fundamental importance of this phenomenon for both in vivo and in vitro antigen-antibody interactions, it is not generally accepted {{because of the lack}} of conclusive evidence. This report utilizes a novel approach to the study of antibody-induced antigenic conformational changes. Pairs of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were used to induce and to assess conformational changes in potato virus X (PVX) protein. <b>Blocking</b> <b>ELISA</b> with native and glutaraldehyde treated virus was used to detect conformational changes. Double antibody sandwich (DAS) ELISA was designed to investigate possible inter-molecular spread of conformational changes. Detection of one way blocking in a <b>blocking</b> <b>ELISA,</b> with a pair of mAbs reacting to non-overlapping epitopes, suggested conformational change as the mechanism of blocking. The putative conformational change was confirmed when the one way blocking was prevented using conformationally restrained virus. Inter-molecular spread of the conformational change among the molecules of PVX protein was demonstrated in DAS-ELISA, when capture mAb inhibited binding of detecting mAb in the absence of steric hindrance. Unlike X-ray crystallography, the methodology utilized in this study indicates directly the significance of a changed conformation to antibody binding. Source type: Electronic(1...|$|E
40|$|Having helped MAF {{design a}} {{nationwide}} bulk tank milk (BTM) survey in early 2007, the sampling frame (with some minor modification) presented {{us with an}} ideal opportunity to explore the state of BVD herd infection amongst New Zealand dairy herds.

For several years a <b>blocking</b> BVD antibody <b>ELISA</b> {{has been applied to}} bulk tank milks as a semi-quantitative predictor of within-herd seroprevalence and contact with BVD virus (Cross and Ellison 2004). Given that contact with a persistently infected (PI) animal results in rapid sero-conversion of the majority of herd mates, the rationale behind a herd antibody, sero-prevalence test to gauge herd exposure to a BVD PI is sound with careful interpretation, and has been used in BVD control schemes overseas (Houe et al 2006...|$|R
30|$|In {{the later}} stages of drug development, {{solution}} competitive ELISA is highly preferred for purified candidate molecules, more subtle differences {{can be detected}} in this method. Three types of competitive ELISA {{have been developed to}} detect the binding activity of mAb molecules. In the first format, labeled Format B in Fig.  2 A, specific antigens are coated on the surface of 96 -well plate. Serially diluted test mAbs are premixed with a constant labeled standard. There is a competition of binding ability between the test mAb and standard. The second competitive ELISA, labeled Format C in Fig.  2 A, uses a standard mAb as coating. A serially diluted test mAb is premixed with a labeled antigen, with an equal amount in the different wells. Both assays are useful to analyze the quality of mAbs through the measurement of IC 50 values. In addition, if an antigen-specific ligand could be achieved, a ligand <b>blocking</b> assay-based competitive <b>ELISA</b> could be established. The ligand blocking assay, labeled Format D in Fig.  2 A, is similar to Format B, but the labeled antibody is replaced with a labeled binding molecule of the ligand. The mode of action, affinity, and footprint can be elucidated {{with the use of the}} ligand-blocking assay. However, a soluble and labeled ligand is essential for this assay format.|$|R
40|$|The {{carbohydrate}} larval antigen, CarLA, {{is present}} on the exposed surface of all strongylid nematode infective L 3 larvae tested, and antibodies against CarLA can promote rapid immune rejection of incoming Trichostrongylus colubriformis larvae in sheep. A library of ovine recombinant single chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragments, displayed on phage, was prepared from B cell mRNA of field-immune sheep. Phage displaying scFvs that bind {{to the surface of}} living exsheathed T. colubriformis L 3 larvae were identified, and the majority of worm-binding scFvs recognized CarLA. Characterization of greater than 500 worm surface binding phage resulted in the identification of nine different anti-CarLA scFvs that recognized three distinct T. colubriformis CarLA epitopes based on <b>blocking</b> and additive <b>ELISA.</b> All anti-CarLA scFvs were specific to the T. colubriformis species of nematode. Each of the three scFv epitope classes displayed identical Western blot recognition patterns and recognized the exposed surface of living T. colubriformis exsheathed L 3 larvae. Surprisingly, each of the anti-CarLA scFvs was able to bind to only a subset of worms. Double-labelling indirect immunofluorescence revealed that the three classes of anti-CarLA scFvs recognize distinct, non-overlapping, T. colubriformis sub-populations. These results demonstrate that individual T. colubriformis L 3 larvae display only one of at least three distinct antigenic forms of CarLA on their surface at any given time, and suggest tha...|$|R
