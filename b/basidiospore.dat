5|$|Panellus stipticus uses a heterothallic, tetrapolar mating system: each <b>basidiospore</b> {{develops}} into a self-sterile mycelium which, when grown alone, remains homokaryotic (i.e., {{with all}} cells genetically identical) indefinitely. Researchers have paired collections of P.stipticus from Japan and Eastern North America, and later, collections from New Zealand and Russia. Although the separated allopatric populations differ in bioluminescence and taste, {{the results revealed}} a universal intercompatibility group over these geographical regions. In a 2001 study, Jin and colleagues also paired geographically representative collections of the fungus, but observed a reduced ability to cross between Northern Hemisphere and Oceanian collections, {{as well as between}} and within Oceanian collections.|$|E
25|$|From {{the plant}} hosts, {{critical}} metabolites are {{released into the}} rhizosphere {{that are capable of}} triggering <b>basidiospore</b> germination, growth of hyphae towards the root, and the early steps of the EcM formation. These exudates can include, but are not limited to, flavonoids, diterpenes, cytokinins, hormones and other nutrients. Some host-released metabolites have been shown to stimulate fungal growth in Pisolithus, modify the branching angle of hyphae, and cause the accumulation of certain fungal molecules that tend to be present in higher quantities during mycorrhiza development.|$|E
2500|$|The holotype of Aureofungus is a fruiting {{body and}} {{associated}} basidiospores. [...] The pileus is [...] {{in diameter and}} has a convex shape sporting a broad raised central region. [...] The lightly textured flesh is yellow-brown in coloration and sports a striated, incurved margin. [...] The lamellae or gills are subdistant and lacking lamellulae, short gills which do not reach {{the edge of the}} pileus. [...] The pileus is centered on the stipe, which is [...] long and lacking the volva, annulus and any rhizoids. [...] The basidiospores associated with the fruiting body are grouped in masses and appear to have been produced by the fruiting body after entombment in the resin. [...] Each <b>basidiospore</b> is broadly elliptic and approximately 4.0μm by 3.3μm.|$|E
50|$|After {{landing in}} an open floret, the teliospores give rise to <b>basidiospores.</b> Without {{dispersing}} to any alternate host plant, the <b>basidiospores</b> germinate right where they are. The hyphae of two compatible <b>basidiospores</b> then fuse to establish a dikarytic stage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Basidiospores</b> are {{generally}} {{characterized by an}} attachment peg (called a hilar appendage) on its surface. This is where the spore {{was attached to the}} basidium. The hilar appendage is quite prominent in some <b>basidiospores,</b> but less evident in others. An apical germ pore may also be present. Many <b>basidiospores</b> have an asymmetric shape due to their development on the basidium. <b>Basidiospores</b> are typically single-celled (without septa), and typically range from spherical to oval to oblong, to ellipsoid or cylindrical. The surface of the spore can be fairly smooth, or it can be ornamented.|$|R
40|$|Prototrophic strains {{recovered}} from crosses between auxotrophic {{strains of the}} lignin-degrading basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium were induced to fruit. The progeny of most of these self-crosses were prototrophic, indicating that the nuclei of the original prototroph were wild-type recombinants rather than complementary heterokaryons and that the binucleate <b>basidiospores</b> of this organism are homokaryotic. Various wild-type strains were shown to have multinucleate cells lacking clamp connections and to possess a variable number of sterigmata per basidium. Colonies arising from single conidia of various wild-type strains were all capable of producing fruit bodies and <b>basidiospores.</b> In addition, single <b>basidiospores</b> from three wild-type strains all produced fruit bodies and <b>basidiospores.</b> Nonfruiting as well as fruiting isolates were obtained from single <b>basidiospores</b> of five other wild-type strains. <b>Basidiospores</b> from these fruiting isolates always yielded colonies that fruited, again indicating that the spores are homokaryotic. Nonfruiting isolates from the same strain did not produce <b>basidiospores</b> when allowed to form a heterokaryon, implying that these isolates do not represent mating types. All this evidence indicates that P. chrysosporium has a primary homothallic mating system. In addition to fruiting and nonfruiting phenotypes, <b>basidiospores</b> from strain OGC 101, a derivative of ME- 446, gave rise to colonies which did not grow on cellulose (Cel−). The fruiting, nonfruiting, and Cel− phenotypes differed {{from each other and}} from the parental wild-type strain in a variety of characteristics, including growth, conidiation, and evolution of 14 CO 2 from 14 C-side chain-labeled lignin, indicating that strain OCG 101 is a heterokaryon...|$|R

50|$|Cryptococcosis is {{believed}} to be acquired by inhalation of the infectious propagule from the environment. Although the exact nature of the infectious propagule is unknown, the leading hypothesis is the <b>basidiospore</b> created through sexual or asexual reproduction.|$|E
40|$|Three hypha-forming {{strains of}} Cryptococcus neoformans were induced to form basidia and <b>basidiospores.</b> Light {{microscopy}} showed that basidia formed {{at the ends}} of terminal hyphal cells and were able to produce from a few to many <b>basidiospores.</b> The morphology of the sexual structures indicated that these strains belonged to the recently described perfect state of C. neoformans, Filobasidiella neoformans. The average dimensions of the <b>basidiospores</b> were 1. 9 mum in width by 2. 7 mum in length. Giemsa staining revealed that dikaryotic cells were formed in all three strains. Only one strain had both terminal and subterminal dikaryons, indicating functional clamp connections, whereas the two remaining strains had dikaryons restricted to the terminal cells. <b>Basidiospores</b> of two strains were mononucleate, and yeast cell clones derived from single <b>basidiospores</b> of these two strains were able to complete the sexual life cycle, thus indicating their primary homothallic nature...|$|R
50|$|Phellinus tremulae spreads through {{airborne}} <b>basidiospores.</b> Sporulation {{occurs in}} late winter, early spring, and continues with moist {{weather in the}} summer. Spores germinate sexually in fresh wounds only (<1 week old) and conks are produced by the fungus body after 5 years of infection. The conks produce the <b>basidiospores</b> on the underside and setae surround the basidia for protection. Phellinus tremulae has spherical spores with four <b>basidiospores</b> per basidium and generative, skeletal hyphae. Compared to other species in the genus Phellinus, the setae are large and the <b>basidiospores</b> are much smaller. Within the tube layers, mycelium crowd the space. The infection of aspen trunk rot is localized, but decay can spread 2-3 meters {{above and below the}} infection site.|$|R
40|$|Homokaryotic {{isolates}} of Phanerochaete chrysosporium {{are generally}} obtained by stimulating {{the production of}} <b>basidiospores.</b> The most commonly used method requires a special incubator that is maintained at 28 degrees C with continuous illumination. Here we report an alternate method which permits the production of basidiopores with common laboratory incubators and requires no special illumination conditions. This alternate method gives reproducible results and yields <b>basidiospores</b> that are not contaminated with conidia. We also report a detailed optimized method for staining <b>basidiospores</b> for visualizing nuclei...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{maturity}} of a <b>basidiospore,</b> sugars {{present in the}} cell wall begin to serve as condensation loci for water vapor in the air. Two separate regions of condensation are critical. At the pointed tip of the spore (the hilum) closest to the supporting basidium, Buller's drop accumulates as a large, almost spherical water droplet. At the same time, condensation occurs in thin film on the adaxial face of the spore. When these two bodies of water coalesce, the release of surface tension and the sudden change {{in the center of}} mass leads to sudden discharge of the <b>basidiospore.</b> Remarkably, Money (1998) has estimated the initial acceleration of the spore to be about 10,000g.|$|E
50|$|Entocybe was {{circumscribed}} in 2011 to contain several former Entoloma species having obscurely angular <b>basidiospore</b> with 6-10 angles (some formerly classified as Rhodocybe). In a revised classification of the Rhodocybe-Clitopilus clade, Kluting and colleagues introduced the new genus Clitocella, and resurrected Clitopilopsis and Rhodophana (formerly synonyms of Rhodocybe).|$|E
50|$|He is {{well known}} in {{mycology}} for developing the staining solution Melzer's reagent, which he developed in 1924 as a modification of an older chloral hydrate-containing iodine solution developed by the botanist Arthur Meyer.

40|$|Sugars {{can serve}} as the {{germinant}} for <b>basidiospores</b> of the wood-rotting fungus Lenzites saepiaria. Hexoses sterilized by autoclaving were better germinants than hexoses that were sterilized by filtration. The degradation products in heated hexose which {{were responsible for the}} stimulation of germination were levulinic and formic acid. Another product of hexose degradation, hydroxymethyl furfural, had a marked effect on outgrowth of L. saepiaria <b>basidiospores</b> and on the development of mycelia. <b>Basidiospores</b> that germinated in the presence of hydroxymethyl furfural yielded large rounded bodies that, in some cases, developed as a chain of yeastlike cells. Addition of hydroxymethyl furfural to developing mycelia resulted in the production of chains of round yeastlike structures. Similar results were obtained by treating <b>basidiospores</b> or mycelia with phenethyl alcohol...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Two new Exobasidium {{species on}} Vaccinium spp. in Japan are {{described}} and discussed. Exobasidium kishianum, which causes Exobasidium leaf blight on I/. hirtum var. pubescens and V. smallii, {{is characterized by}} its ellipsoid to ovoid <b>basidiospores</b> with (0 -) 1 - 3 septa. Its systemic infection is also observed. Exobasidium inconspicuum, cansing Exobasidium leaf blister on V. hirtum vat. pubescens, is characterized by its obovoid or ellipsoid to oval <b>basidiospores</b> with 0 - 4 septa.

50|$|In his research, Corner {{stressed}} the importance of understanding the development and anatomy of fungi, which he realised could not be known just by observing one stage of the specimen. Arguably, his most important contribution on fungal development was determining the role of the basidium as a charged ampoule. He also observed <b>basidiospore</b> development in boletoid and tricholomatoid fungi.|$|E
50|$|Hohenbuehelia is a pleurotoid genus of agaric fungi {{characterized}} by gelatinous-sheathed bowling-pin-shaped cystidia, on conidia, <b>basidiospore</b> germ tubes, and mycelium that adhere to and capture nematodes. The fruitbodies bear thick-walled cystidia (metuloids) in the hymenium along the gill sides and that differentiate the genus from Pleurotus in the Pleurotaceae family. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains about 50 species.|$|E
50|$|Ganoderma is a genus of polypore {{mushrooms}} {{that grow}} on wood, and include about 80 species, many from tropical regions. Because of their extensive use in traditional Asian medicines, {{and their potential}} in bioremediation, they are a very important genus economically. Ganoderma can be differentiated from other polypores {{because they have a}} double-walled <b>basidiospore.</b> They are popularly referred to as shelf mushrooms or bracket fungi.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{germination}} hyphae {{produced by}} the aeciospores penetrate the grass, leading {{to the production of}} uredia. The uredia produce urediniospores capable of infecting more grass plants. Ultimately, telia are produced on the infected grasses.

50|$|Each {{teliospore}} undergoes karyogamy (fusion of nuclei) and meiosis to form four haploid spores called <b>basidiospores.</b> This is {{an important}} source of genetic recombination in the life cycle. <b>Basidiospores</b> are thin-walled and colourless. They cannot infect the cereal host, but can infect the alternative host (usually barberry). They are usually carried to the alternative host by wind.|$|R
50|$|The mature two-celled basidiospores {{are very}} easily {{dislodged}} from the sterigmata {{and are usually}} to {{be found on the}} surface of the blister. In carefully collected material we have seen the mature two-celled basidiospores attached to sterigmata.Although the <b>basidiospore</b> is normally one-septate, as many as three septa have been seen in germinated spores. The view is expressed that the extra septa are normally formed during germination.|$|E
50|$|Webster's {{greatest}} {{contribution to}} the science of mycology was in determining the mechanism for fungal spore discharge in basidiomycetes using high-speed video microscopy, which {{he and his team}} at Exeter University perfected in the 1980s. His elegant elucidation of the role of Buller’s drop in <b>basidiospore</b> discharge is regarded as a classic. The mechanism was demonstrated to be a surface-tension catapult, originally suggested in 1922 by A.H.R.Buller, and by C.T.Ingold in 1939.|$|E
5000|$|In most basidiomycota, the basidiospores are ballistospores—they are {{forcibly}} discharged. The propulsive {{force is}} derived from a sudden change {{in the center of}} gravity of the discharged spore. Important factors in forcible discharge include Buller's drop, a droplet of fluid that can be observed to accumulate at the proximal tip (hilar appendage) of each basidiospore; the offset attachment of the spore to the subtending sterigma, and the presence of hygroscopic regions on the <b>basidiospore</b> surface.|$|E
5000|$|Sexual spores called <b>basidiospores</b> {{are created}} in the fertile layer on the lower surface of the basidiocarps, whilst conidiospores occur in the asexual stage and are {{produced}} on microscopic [...] "conidiophores" [...] which erupt through {{the surface of the}} host tree. Conidiospores and <b>basidiospores</b> are both produced by this fungus, the latter being more important for infecting the conifers.|$|R

50|$|When <b>basidiospores</b> {{encounter}} a favorable substrate, they may germinate, typically by forming hyphae. These hyphae grow {{outward from the}} original spore, forming an expanding circle of mycelium. The circular shape of a fungal colony explains the formation of fairy rings, and also the circular lesions of skin-infecting fungi that cause ringworm. Some <b>basidiospores</b> germinate repetitively by forming small spores instead of hyphae.|$|R
5000|$|The {{group was}} {{formerly}} {{included in the}} genus Clitocybe, but has been erected to genus level to accommodate species for which mycelium cannot reduce nitrate and basidiospores do not adhere in tetrads, but exhibit a lacrymoid (tear-shaped) morphology, a confluent base and a cyanophobic <b>basidiospore</b> wall. The genus contains 19 widespread species according to the Index Fungorum and one new species I. rufa, only known from high altitude localities in southwestern China, described in 2016.|$|E
5000|$|A {{basidium}} (pl., basidia) is a microscopic, spore-producing structure {{found on}} the hymenophore of fruiting bodies of basidiomycete fungi.

A basidium usually bears four sexual spores called basidiospores; occasionally the number may be two or even eight. In a typical basidium, each <b>basidiospore</b> is borne at the tip of a narrow prong or horn called a sterigma (pl. sterigmata), and is forcibly discharged upon maturity.|$|E

In this review we have therefore compiled morphological and ecological facts about <b>basidiospores</b> of agaricoid fungi and their functional implications for fungal communities as part of ecosystems. Readers are introduced to the subject, first of all by drawing attention to the dazzling array of <b>basidiospores,</b> which is followed by an account of their physical and chemical qualities, such as size, quantity, structure and their molecular composition.

50|$|The {{maintenance}} of the dikaryotic status in dikaryons in many Basidiomycota is facilitated by the formation of clamp connections that physically appear to help coordinate and re-establish pairs of compatible nuclei following synchronous mitotic nuclear divisions. Variations are frequent and multiple. In a typical Basidiomycota lifecycle the long lasting dikaryons periodically (seasonally or occasionally) produce basidia, the specialized usually club-shaped end cells, in which a pair of compatible nuclei fuse (karyogamy) to form a diploid cell. Meiosis follows shortly with the production of 4 haploid nuclei that migrate into 4 external, usually apical <b>basidiospores.</b> Variations occur, however. Typically the <b>basidiospores</b> are ballistic, hence they are sometimes also called ballistospores. In most species, the <b>basidiospores</b> disperse and each can start a new haploid mycelium, continuing the lifecycle. Basidia are microscopic but they are often produced on or in multicelled large fructifications called basidiocarps or basidiomes, or fruitbodies), variously called mushrooms, puffballs, etc. Ballistic <b>basidiospores</b> are formed on sterigmata which are tapered spine-like projections on basidia, and are typically curved, like the horns of a bull. In some Basidiomycota the spores are not ballistic, and the sterigmata may be straight, reduced to stubbs, or absent. The <b>basidiospores</b> of these non-ballistosporic basidia may either bud off, or be released via dissolution or disintegration of the basidia.|$|R
