50|$|Animal liberationists usually boycott {{industries}} that use animals. Foremost among these is factory farming, which produces {{the majority of}} meat, dairy products, and eggs in industrialized nations.

5000|$|In August 1994, tabloid {{newspaper}} the Daily Star {{published an}} article disclosing that British Airways (BA) were transporting live sheep between Perth, Scotland and Singapore. Within twenty four hours of the newspaper being published, Robert Ayling, BA's group managing director, banned the carriage of live <b>animals</b> destined <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> on BA flights. In the face of increasing public pressure, Brittany Ferries announced that as of 22 August 1994 {{it would no longer}} export live <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> on its six routes to France and Spain.

25|$|Throughout history {{individuals}} have condemned various practices that they {{considered to be}} cruel to animals.

50|$|Several equine and animal-welfare {{organizations}} oppose slaughter {{or support}} {{a ban on}} horse slaughter, but other animal organizations and animal-agriculture groups support the practice. According to livestock-slaughter expert Temple Grandin, horse slaughter can be humane with proper facility design and management. Included in animal-agriculture groups supporting horse slaughter are organizations representing the interests of traditional food-animal industries such as cattle, sheep and pigs, who are concerned that banning any <b>animal</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> will lead to outlawing all meat production.|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{production}} of wool is spread across the islands, the breeding of <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> is concentrated on East Falkland where the EU accredited Send Bay abattoir is situated. An additional cost borne by producers on West Falklands is the fare charged for crossing the Falklands Sound. As of 2010, the ferry company making the crossing charged commercial vehicles £30 per metre for a single trip plus £2 per head of sheep. Wool {{on the other hand}} is charged [...] "£45 per tonne delivered to Stanley".|$|R

50|$|In March 2011, Animals Australia {{investigators}} collected footage {{which showed}} Australian cattle being slaughtered at 11 abattoirs in Indonesia with practices that infringed upon OIE standards <b>for</b> <b>animal</b> welfare. Animals Australia and RSPCA Australia jointly {{complained to the}} federal Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, calling for a ban on live exports. In response to the footage, live exports to Indonesia were suspended by the Australian Minister for Agriculture from June 7, 2011 until July 6, 2011. The suspension was lifted with the new Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System in place, outlining mandatory compliance for all importing markets of Australian live <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter,</b> with international standards <b>for</b> <b>animal</b> welfare. The ESCAS regulatory framework is applicable across all importing markets as of December 31, 2012.|$|R
50|$|Downer {{cows are}} <b>animals</b> {{presented}} <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> that are sick {{or unable to}} walk. One of many causes for a downer is BSE.

50|$|Certain {{populations have}} {{considerable}} historic or sentimental value, {{such as the}} Chincoteague pony that lives on Assateague Island, a national seashore with a delicate coastal ecosystem, or the Misaki pony of Japan that lives on a small refuge within the municipal boundaries of Kushima. These populations manage to thrive with careful management that includes using the animals to promote tourism to support the local economy. Most sustained feral populations are managed by various forms of culling, which, depending on the nation and other local conditions, may include capturing excess <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> adoption or sale. In some nations, management may include the often-controversial practice of selling captured <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> or simply shooting them. Fertility control is also sometimes used, though it is expensive {{and has to be}} repeated on a regular basis.|$|R

[...] The total number of farm animal deaths each year is considerably higher than the slaughter total, since at least tens of millions die before they are slaughtered.|$|R
2500|$|Temple Grandin, {{who is both}} {{an animal}} welfare activist and the leading American {{designer}} of commercial slaughterhouses, has outlined techniques <b>for</b> humane ritual <b>slaughter.</b> She considers shackling and hoisting of <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> to be inhumane, and has developed alternative approaches usable in production plants. Grandin has coordinated this with the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Conservative movement in the United States, and in 2000 the Committee voted to accept her approach, ruling that [...] "Now that kosher, humane slaughter using upright pens is both possible and widespread, we find shackling and hoisting to {{be a violation of}} Jewish laws forbidding cruelty to animals and requiring that we avoid unnecessary dangers to human life. As the CJLS, then, we rule that shackling and hoisting should be stopped." ...|$|R
50|$|Buddhism is {{the third}} major {{religion}} to emerge in India, and its teachings also include ahimsa. Buddhism teaches vegetarianism (though not as strictly as Jainism), and many Buddhists practice life release in which <b>animals</b> destined <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> are purchased and released to the wild.

50|$|Amongst {{the goods}} {{delivered}} to Göhrde were food, {{in the form}} of part-piece loads, and artificial fertiliser, briquets and coke, peat, sugar beet scraps and other feedstuffs in full wagon loads. Goods dipatched included eating and seed potatoes, sugar beet, straw, hay, pit props, oak, beech and spruce logs, <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>slaughter</b> and <b>for</b> breeding. Even by imperial times, grain was loaded for dispatch to Berlin. In the 1920s wood for dolphins was delivered from Göhrde to Hamburg Harbour and, in the post-war years, large quantities of pit props were sent to the Ruhr area. Sugar beet was loaded here until the late 1980s. In the last years before the goods facilities were closed logs were the only freight to be loaded at Göhrde.|$|R
50|$|Skullgrin Like {{several other}} Pretenders, Skullgrins {{personality}} changed somewhat {{when he received}} his Pretender shell. Normally a cool, calculating combatant, inside the shell he becomes a rampaging engine of destruction that tries to destroy everything in his path, never retreating. It has been speculated that the shell has a personality of its own. However, the egotistical Skullgrin has a surprising personality quirk — he loves Earth and is fascinated by it. Making him very different from other Decepticons. In his affair with Circuit-Breaker, he actually bargained for fuel instead of fighting to avoid any casualties. Skullgrins Pretender shell is easily distinguishable by having the skull of a <b>bovine</b> <b>animal</b> <b>for</b> a head. The shells dark gray color, multiple spikes, and skull ornaments on its belt give it a menacing appearance, similar to Judge Death. The inner Skullgrin robot transforms into a Cybertronian tank.|$|R
