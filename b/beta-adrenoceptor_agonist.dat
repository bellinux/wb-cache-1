40|$|Aims: Relaxation of {{detrusor}} muscle via beta-adrenoceptors {{may contribute}} to urine storage during bladder filling. Thus there is increasing interest in <b>beta-adrenoceptor</b> <b>agonists</b> as a potential treatment for detrusor overactivity. The role of the urothelium in bladder responses to <b>beta-adrenoceptor</b> <b>agonists</b> is not yet clear, although we have shown that these agonists have a greater inhibitory effect on detrusor contraction when the urothelium is intact. The aim was to determine which beta-adrenoceptor subtype is involved in this effect. Methods: Paired strips of pig bladder dome mucosa-intact and mucosa-denuded, were mounted in tissue baths. Relaxation responses were obtained to <b>beta-adrenoceptor</b> <b>agonists</b> (isoprenaline, dobutamine, salbutamol or BRL 37344) in carbachol pre-contracted tissues. Inhibitory effects were studied by obtaining concentration-response curves (CRCs) to carbachol in the presence and absence of <b>beta-adrenoceptor</b> <b>agonists.</b> The inhibitory effects of isoprenaline were also studied following incubation with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (propranolol, CGP 20712, ICI- 118, 551 or SR 59230 A; non selected, beta(1), beta(2) and beta(3) selective respectively). Results: isoprenaline, dobutamine, salbutamol and BRL 37344 all relaxed carbachol pre-contracted tissues and responses were similar in intact and denuded strips. In inhibition experiments, padrenoceptor agonists caused rightward shifts of carbachol CRCs. In intact strips the shift was greater with isoprenaline and BRL 37344, but not with dobutamine or salbutamol. This increased shift was still observed in tissues pre-incubated with propranolo, CGP 20712 and ICI- 118, 551, but not with SR 59230 A.

40|$|<b>Beta-adrenoceptor</b> <b>agonists</b> (beta-agonists) bind to beta-receptors on cardiac {{and smooth}} muscle tissues.

40|$|Muscarinic {{receptor}} antagonists and <b>beta-adrenoceptor</b> <b>agonists</b> {{are used}} in the treatment of obstructive airway disease and overactive bladder syndrome. Here we review the pharmacological rationale for their combination. Muscarinic receptors and beta-adrenoceptors are physiological antagonists for smooth muscle tone in airways and bladder. Muscarinic agonism may attenuate beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation more than other contractile stimuli. Chronic treatment with one drug class may regulate expression of the target receptor but also that of the opposing receptor. Prejunctional beta(2) -adrenoceptors can enhance neuronal acetylcholine release. Moreover, at least in the airways, muscarinic receptors and beta-adrenoceptors are expressed in different locations, indicating that only a combined modulation of both systems may cause dilatation along the entire bronchial tree. While all of these factors contribute to a rationale for a combination of muscarinic receptor antagonists and <b>beta-adrenoceptor</b> <b>agonists,</b> the full value of such combination as compared to monotherapy can only be determined in clinical studies...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In small arteries, SKCa and IKCa {{channels}} {{restricted to}} the vascular endothelium generate hyperpolarization that underpins the NO- and PGI 2 -independent, EDHF response that is the predominate endothelial mechanism for vasodilatation. As neuronal IKCa channels can be negatively regulated by PKA, we investigated whether beta-adrenoceptor stimulation, which signals through cAMP/PKA, might influence endothelial cell hyperpolarization {{and as a result}} modify the associated vasodilatation. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rat isolated small mesenteric arteries were pressurized to measure vasodilatation and endothelial cell [Ca 2 +]i, mounted in a wire myograph to measure smooth muscle membrane potential or dispersed into endothelial cell sheets for membrane potential recording. KEY RESULTS: Intraluminal perfusion of <b>beta-adrenoceptor</b> <b>agonists</b> inhibited endothelium-dependent dilatation to ACh (1 nM - 10 muM) without modifying the associated changes in endothelial cell [Ca 2 +]i. The inhibitory effect of <b>beta-adrenoceptor</b> <b>agonists</b> was mimicked by direct activation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin, blocked by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol (non-selective), atenolol (beta 1) or the PKA inhibitor KT- 5720; but remained unaffected by ICI 118, 551 (beta 2) or glibenclamide (KATP channel blocker). Endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization to ACh was also inhibited by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in both intact arteries and in endothelial cells sheets. Blocking IKCa (with 1 muM TRAM- 34) but not SKCa (50 nM apamin) channels prevented <b>beta-adrenoceptor</b> <b>agonists</b> from suppressing either hyperpolarization or vasodilatation to ACh. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In resistance arteries, endothelial cell beta 1 -adrenoceptors link to inhibit endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization and the resulting vasodilatation to ACh.

Cells were stimulated either by anti-mouse mu-chain antibodies (anti-mu), or by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or a membrane proteoglycan of Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp MPG), a T-independent polyclonal activator distinct from LPS, which induces B-cell proliferation and Ig synthesis. ISO and NE enhanced LPS- and Kp MPG-induced B-cell proliferation and maturation into IgM-, IgG- and IgA-secreting cells. The enhancement was prevented by prior addition of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol but not by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine. Earlier events in the LPS- and Kp MPG-stimulated B-cell activation, such as increases in Ia antigen expression and RNA synthesis, were not modified by the catecholamines. Unlike ISO and NE, the membrane-permeant cyclic adenosine 3 ', 5 '-monophosphate (cAMP) analogue dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP), and the potent adenylate cyclase activator forskolin did not enhance but even inhibited DNA synthesis and Ig secretion stimulated by LPS and Kp MPG. In addition, ISO and NE did not enhance but strongly inhibited anti-mu-induced B-cell proliferation, and these effects were mimicked by dbcAMP and forskolin. Collectively, the data demonstrate that beta-agonists differently modulate B-cell activation depending upon the polyclonal activator, and provide additional evidence for distinct biochemical mechanisms of B-cell activation by anti-mu and LPS. Moreover, our results indicate that beta-adrenergic stimulation up-regulates B-cell responses to LPS and Kp MPG by a novel and cAMP-independent pathway...|$|E

All these drugs produced their action very rapidly and appear to act within the peritoneum. (-) -Isoprenaline had about six times the potency of the (+) -isomer. (+/-) -Propranolol caused rightward shifts, usually parallel, of the dose-response curves for (-) -isoprenaline. (+) -Propranolol was more than ten times less potent than the racemic drug.

The differences in mucin content also occurred if the beta-blockers were administered only during the ovalbumin challenge phase, but administration of beta-blockers for 7 days was not as effective as administration for 28 days. These results indicate that in a murine model of asthma, chronic administration of beta-blockers reduces inflammation and mucous metaplasia, cardinal features of asthma that may contribute to airflow obstruction and AHR.

40|$|An {{intravenous}} K+-sensitive electrode {{has been}} used to monitor plasma [K+] changes induced by alpha- and <b>beta-adrenoceptor</b> <b>agonists</b> in anaesthetized guinea-pigs, rabbits and rats. The effects of phentolamine and propranolol on these responses were studied. In the guinea-pig both alpha- and <b>beta-adrenoceptor</b> <b>agonists</b> produced a biphasic response consisting of an initial rapid increase in [K+] which was followed, within 1 min, by a fall below baseline. The antagonist studies indicated that in this species both phases of the response could be elicited by either alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor activation. In the rabbit the responses were both slower and smaller than those seen in the guinea-pig and required larger agonist doses. In addition {{it was found that the}} increase in plasma [K+] was alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated while the subsequent fall was seen only with beta-adrenoceptor activation. In the rat triphasic changes in plasma [K+] were seen consisting of an initial decrease which was alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated, followed by an increase and then a second fall which was elicited by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. The increase in plasma [K+] was only slightly reduced by either alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Apamin, a toxin from bee venom which blocks Ca 2 +-activated K+-channels, was found to block the hyperkalaemic phase of the response in the guinea-pig and rabbit but had no effect in the rat. It is concluded that there are marked species differences in the effects of adrenoceptor agonists on plasma [K+] in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Inhalation of the {{platelet}} activating factor (PAF) produces symptoms of bronchial asthma, a disease in which PAF {{plays an important}} role. This lipid mediator released by many kinds of cells exerts its effects on blood cells and on cells of the bronchial wall both directly and indirectly. The crucial role played by PAF in the inflammatory cascades explains the current interest in specific PAF antagonists. These antagonists have both bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory properties and act simultaneously as <b>beta-adrenoceptor</b> <b>agonists</b> and corticosteroids. The first clinical trials of PAF antagonists {{in the treatment of}} resistant asthma have given results that are interesting but not superior to those obtained with the conventional anti-asthmatic drugs. The indications for PAF antagonists combined with other specific antagonists will soon be determined. Peer reviewe...|$|R
