40|$|Office {{workers are}} {{commonly}} targeted in interventions {{to modify their}} sitting behaviour, yet there is limited evidence of the correlates of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting to inform intervention development. This study identifies the individual, workplace and spatial configuration correlates of the frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting (number/hour) in office workers (n = 5531) stratified by office type (private-enclosed, shared, open plan). All behaviours and potential correlates were measured via self-report using an online cross-sectional survey. Regression analyses revealed age was the only socio-demographic characteristic associated with frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting in all office types. Greater job autonomy and local connectivity were positively associated with frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting in shared and open-plan offices. In open-plan offices co-worker proximity was negatively associated with frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting. Co-worker visibility was positively associated with frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting in all office types. This study demonstrates that individual, workplace and spatial configuration factors are all associated with the frequency of <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting and that these relationships differ by office type. These observations extend prior studies that have only examined correlates at a single level (e. g. the individual). This evidence could be useful to guide future interventions {{in the design of}} workplaces to increase <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sitting and workers physical activity...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: To date it {{is unknown}} whether there are moderating {{variables}} for the associations between children’s self-reported screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time and objectively measured sedentary time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sedentary time. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine whether the associations between self-reported screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time and accelerometer assessed sedentary time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sedentary time were moderated by gender, ethnicity, children’s moderate-to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), parents’ educational level, parents’ screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time and parents physical activity (PA). Methods: Screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time were assessed with questionnaires in a sample of 445 children (10 - 12 years) in Belgium, Greece, Hungary and Norway. Parents’ screen time, <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time, parents’ PA and demographics were also assessed with questionnaires. Accelerometers measured sedentary time per day and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sedentary time per day and MVPA (children only). Bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were applied to assess the associations between the independent variables and the dependent variables. Interaction terms were added in the final model to examine whether the associations between self-reported screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time and accelerometer assessed sedentary time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> sedentary time were moderated by the significant independent variables. Results: No statistical significant interactions were found between the significant independent variables. Country specific significant associations were found between self-reported screen time and gender, parents’ screen time, parents’ educational level and accelerometer assessed sedentary time. Country specific associations were found between self-reported breaks during one hour of screen time and parents’ educational level and ethnicity. Conclusion: The associations between self-reported screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time and accelerometer assessed sedentary time and breaks were not moderated by gender, ethnicity, MVPA, parents’ educational level, parents’ self-reported screen time and <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> screen time and parents’ PA.
