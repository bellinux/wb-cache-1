40|$|To {{drive the}} {{high side switch}} in a half bridge {{configuration}} {{it is necessary to}} transmit signals from the micro controller to the floating high side potential. Depending on the performance level of the drive circuit either HV IC´s with different kinds of level shifters, opto-couplers or transformers are employed for signal interchange. HV IC´s with level shifters are comparably inexpensive, but they can not on principle grant galvanic isolation. Opto-couplers on the other hand do provide safe isolation, but they degrade over time. Especially in high performance drives discrete transformers are the common solution, although they are rather expensive.

It have variable characteristics and used extensively in variable-speed drives. The goals of this project are to control the direction and speed of Direct Current (DC) motor. The Radio Frequency (RF) modules also used to make this project as a user friendliness to control the interface yet make it more useful. This project divided into two part of circuit. First circuit is for transmitter and another circuit is for the receiver. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technique is used where its signal is generated by PIC 18 F 4550. The PWM signal will send to the motor driver to vary the voltage supply to the motor in a desired speed. The DC Motor driver L 293 D is used in this project as it is a component that has dual full <b>bridge</b> <b>driver</b> where it also can control the direction of the DC motor.

New systems like the robotic arm CAESAR and the highly dexterous four fingered robotic hand Spacehand are designed {{in order to}} improve the skills and performance of the systems while the needed space for the electronics and the power consumption is decreasing. The small exploration systems MASCOT highlighted the need for a small form factor, highly integrated, lightweight but simultaneously a highly performance motor controller. This paper presents a cold redundant, three phase brushless DC motor driver for medium radiation environment which was developed at the Robotics and Mechatronics Center of the German Aerospace Center (DLR-RMC). The size efficiency of the proposed design relies on an extremely compact position sensing circuit which is based on a resolver principal. The integrated <b>bridge</b> <b>driver,</b> with current limitation, withstands a continuous power up to 120 W. To simplify the design the internal voltages are limited to a minimum set. A fault-tolerant processor is used to guarantee a high reliability, The choice of several standard communication interfaces gives the user multiple possibilities to integrate the board in existing designs. The small form factor improves and simplifies the thermal management as well as the integration in small systems. The simple mechanical shape reduces the integrator effort and offers a large amount of configurations. The three phase current sensing, together with the high performance computation platform, allows the implementation of a high level current control such as field oriented control methods. Such control methods optimize the dynamic performance of the actuator, thus, leveraging the actuator performance to size ratio. The system uses a fully programmable processor unit, offering real-time communication and logging capabilities, fully integrated control loops and rich monitoring.

40|$|In many power {{electronic}} applications galvanic isolated IGBT/MOSFET drivers are advantageously used. The main reasons are safety issues, driving high voltage power semiconductors with blocking voltages of typically 600 V or above and avoiding or minimizing unwanted ground current loops. The last can disturb the driver or the whole {{power electronic}} system. In this paper a new method for achieving galvanic isolation in high voltage drivers based on {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) integrated capacitive coupling elements will be described. The suggested coupling element consists {{of a pair of}} plate capacitors by using copper layers and prepregs of a PCB. First, the influence of the isolation barrier coupling capacitance, {{which is one of the}} main important parameters of a galvanic isolated d river, is illustrated by a simple model of the capacitive current loop. As a result it is stated that the coupling capacitance should be lower than 5 pF to achieve high dU/dt levels of at least 100 kV/μs with the modeled driver circuit. Hereby and taking into account the isolation characteristics of the commonly used FR 4 PCB material, an integrated capacitive coupling element is designed. With 360 μm isolation distance, and a plate surface of approximately 8 mm², a capacitance of about 1 pF is achieved. A comparison of the developed capacitive coupling element with a comparable inductive coupling element (transformer) shows that the former has advantages due to a much lower current consumption and less dependency on parasitic inductancies. Therefore using galvanic isolat ed drivers in system integrated power electronics means achieving very small solutions. On the other side high isolation voltages on PCBs require wide creepage and clearance distances, especially at higher humidity levels. For solving this conflict a special layout is suggested, were the both sides behind the isolation barrier of the driver are placed on different sides on the PCB by using blind and buried vias. In addition a method for transmitting the switching signal over the isolation barrier is suggested. The well known Manchester coding is applied to use the advantages of phase modulated signals. Reducing the complexity for decoding the switching signal, it is suggested to transmit the carrier frequency by a second capacitive coupling element. Hereby, coder as well as decode r could be realized by a simple exclusive logic or gate. To verify the new isolation method a half <b>bridge</b> <b>driver</b> was built up. With that a bidirectional buck-boost DC/DC converter, operating at a DC link voltage of 300 V, was successfully controlled. Moreover measurements with a standardized burst generator show, that failure free operation of the driver are possible up to high dU/dt levels...|$|E
40|$|Cage {{induction}} motor (Cage-IM) {{is one of}} the main prime mover in many industrial sectors. It provides wide range of torque production, robust and lower life cycle cost relatively to other types of motor. However, with the constructional simplicity, cage-IM tradeoff control complexity. This is due to the coupling of field and armature where the rotor magnetization is depends on the stator part. The simplest way to drive cage-IM is by implementation of series resistor at the stator terminal. But this technique is not suitable for high power IM as the heat dissipated at the resistor will make the operation of IM less power efficient. The implementation of cycloconverter circuit offers other alternative but the circuit is quite complex and less efficient as the device will used power switches at active region instead of switch mode. On the other hand, Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) implementing S-PWM to provide adjustable power to the IM. S-PWM waveforms control the switching of the power switches bridge to create DC to AC conversion. In this research, the 3 -phase McMurray bridge topology is implemented. This 2 levels 3 legs topology is among the most commonly used in real application. An open loop IM drive implementing S-PWM VSI is simulated using SIMULINK. The results are comparatively analyzed through comparison with SV-PWM VSI to verify the system simulation model. Voltage and current at the stator terminal are measured and analyzed at transient and steady state to study the harmonics distortion as well as IM performance. The results shows that S-PWM VSI is capable to drive IM with 80. 23 % and 16. 86 % total harmonics distortion for voltage and current respectively. At transient state 265 % electromagnetic torque overshoot occurs and the system took 0. 2 s for setting time. This performance results are consistent for NEMA Class B IM. The S-PWM circuit is designed with the aid of SPICE software. A 3 -phase sinusoidal waves, a Centre-aligned triangle wave, 3 -phase S-PWM comparator modules are implemented with operational amplifier circuit configurations of specific ICs. The designed circuits are applied for real hardware implementation and the results are compared with the simulated results. DC offset, ringing noises, amplitude and frequency errors occur on the real hardware model which are not presented by the simulation results. These errors are managed by manual adjustment of the reference modulating wave (Vref), carrier signal (Vcarrier) though Rv adjustment knob and the amount of supplied voltage of the ICs (VCC, VEE). The isolation between control circuit module (S-PWM generator) and the high voltage side of the bridge is implemented using opto coupler ICs. For IM drives integration, IR 2130 <b>bridge</b> <b>driver</b> is used to provide deadtime to S-PWM wave pairs as well as interface the control circuit with the IGBTs module and IM. The developed S-PWM inverter module is capable to drive 0. 4 hp cage-IM at rated speed with better power utilization as compared to the conventional variable resistance implementation...|$|E
40|$|An {{ever-increasing}} {{range of}} sophisticated and leading-edge electronic technologies emerging into the automotive field makes {{this one of}} the most dynamic but even complicated manufacturing sector in the world. Car companies are convinced that electronic is the key to meet different and often divergent requirements such as high-safety vehicles, comfort, infotainment, gas emission reduction, power saving, low cost technologies and short time to market. For these reasons the expectations on the electronic automotive systems are very high since {{it seems to be the}} major factor of innovation technology and differentiation in a more and more competitive market field. The hardness of this market scenario has a direct impact on the complexity of electronic systems. Many features on modern medium-segment cars are based on high performance Electronic Control Units dealing with up to 2500 signals. As a consequence the number of sensing and actuating elements hidden into the body or the chassis of a car is growing continuously. Moreover as many hydraulic and mechanical actuators are replaced by power consuming electronic components and new entertainment features are provided to meet customer’s requests, power saving becomes an issue even in the automotive field. The PhD research activity has been focused on the design of integrated electronic systems for the automotive fields. The new requirements of the automotive market together with the necessity to reduce time to market imply a complete review of the electronic systems design flows. For these reasons the PhD activities have been always leaded following a platform based design approach in order to give a proper answer to the aforementioned requirements and to give a more efficient alternative to the actual design approaches. Chapter 1 of this thesis explains in much more details the automotive market requirements focusing on the characteristics of each particular segment and presenting the main actual and future automotive applications. A particular attention is given to the electronic automotive challenges and design issues implied by this scenario that has motivated the overall PhD activities. Chapter 2 starts with the presentation of the actual state of the art of the methodologies used in the electronic automotive field and continues with the description of the proposed platform called Intelligent Sensor InterFace (ISIF). ISIF is a platform targeted to interface automotive sensors and is composed by a high number of highly programmable software and hardware IPs. The platform has been integrated in a 0. 35 um Bipolar CMOS DMOS (BCD) technology supplied by STMicroelectronics. Some case studies regarding fast prototyping possibilities with ISIF are presented: a magneto-resistive position sensor and two capacitive inertial sensors (in collaboration with SensorDynamics AG), a gyro and a low-g YZ accelerometer. Chapter 3 describes the extension of the ISIF application space to high power automotive systems and to laser based video projection systems: High power automotive systems are gaining importance during the last years since many mechanical and hydraulic features are completely transferred to electronic systems.
