5000|$|A <b>bath</b> <b>mat</b> is {{a device}} {{used on the}} floor of a {{bathroom}} to provide a warm non-slip surface, and to absorb small amounts of water, much like a towel.|$|E
50|$|Jerry, {{holding a}} chicken drumstick, {{approaches}} Tom, unaware {{that he is}} now sober and very angry. Tom chases after Jerry towards the bathroom, but slips on a <b>bath</b> <b>mat</b> and crashes into a wall. A bottle of bay rum (a kind of lotion, not alcohol) falls from the bathroom shelf and into Tom's mouth, causing Tom to become drunk again.|$|E
50|$|In the 1940s, the Lighthouse began {{producing}} pot holders, pillow cases, aprons, rag dolls, brooms, mops, woven {{rugs and}} <b>bath</b> <b>mats.</b> It also began caning chairs. Its products were available at a concession {{stand in the}} lobby of Houston's City Hall. It was during this period that the Lighthouse became a United Way agency.|$|R
40|$|Women as {{consumers}} need trained judgment for {{the selection of}} textiles of any kind, and in particular for the selection of household textiles, as sheetings, pillow cases, bed spreads, mattress covers, ticking, blankets, kitchen towels, hand towels, <b>bath</b> towels, <b>bath</b> <b>mats,</b> table cloths, napkins, table runners, luncheon sets, bridge sets, buffet covers, dresser scarfs, curtains for the kitchen, bedrooms, bath rooms, and living rooms of the house, draperies for windows and doors, upholstery, and rugs...|$|R
50|$|Yutyrannus {{is known}} from three nearly {{complete}} fossil specimens (an adult, a subadult and a juvenile) acquired from a fossil dealer who claimed all three had their provenance {{in a single}} quarry at Batuyingzi in Liaoning Province, China. They thus probably were found in a layer of the Yixian Formation, dating from the Aptian, approximately 125 million years old. The specimens had been cut into pieces {{about the size of}} <b>bath</b> <b>mats,</b> which could be carried by two people.|$|R
5000|$|The Earl of Crankcase passes on, {{but instead}} of his three devious nephews, Bullwinkle stands to inherit a million-pound note due to an {{inscription}} on his foot, reading [...] "Rue Britannia". In order to claim it, Bullwinkle and Rocky must spend {{a week in the}} ancestral home, Abominable Manor. This is made difficult as the nephews hire Boris and Natasha to (at first) do away with him, but then they move to Plan B: making Bullwinkle lose the inheritance by exiting the manor. The villains are foiled, but it's revealed that the inscription on one of Bullwinkle's feet was merely an imprint left when he steps on his <b>bath</b> <b>mat.</b> The nephews receive the million-pound note, but {{it turns out to be}} a promissory note, and they end up having to pay it back. In the final scene, Bullwinkle shows Rocket ("Rocky") his other foot with the same [...] "Rue Brittania" [...] imprint which never went away.|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} numbers of Police forces using drones for crime scene surveillance, {{the effect of the}} drones on trace evidence present needs evaluation. In this investigation the effect of flying a quadcopter drone at different heights over a controlled scene and taking off at different distances from the scene were measured. Yarn was placed on a range of floor surfaces and the number lost or moved from their original position was recorded. It was possible to estimate "safe" distances above and take off distance from the <b>bath</b> <b>mat</b> (2. m and 1. m respectively), and carpet tile (3. m and 1. m) which were the roughest surfaces. The maximum distances tested of 5. m above and 2. m from was not far enough to prevent significant disturbance with the other floor surfaces. This report illustrates the importance of considering the impact of new technologies into a forensic workflow on established forensic evidence prior to implementation...|$|E
40|$|Recently, the freak {{accidents}} in home have been increased {{and they are}} caused by the asphyxiation, drowning, falling, fire, and toxicosis. Especially in bathroom, the accident frequently arise and thus the healthcare monitoring and the accident detection system can be useful for attainment of safe and untroubled daily life. While some monitoring systems for moving state using infrared ray and ultrasonic wave were already developed, these methods distinguish only {{whether or not a}} bather is moving. Also, detailed motion analysis using CCD camera has the problem of privacy for the practical use. From these viewpoints, we designed the monitoring system for the electrocardiogram and respiration signal using bathtub-installed electrodes, showing its usefulness for the healthcare and the drowning alarm during taking a bath. However, the range over which this method is possible is limited in the bathtub and thus the detection in washing place are impossible. To solve this drawback, we developed a new system capable of detecting the accident in the washing place together with the pulse and respiration rate using a <b>bath</b> <b>mat</b> type multipoint pressure sensor located in washing place of bathroom. From the results of the accuracy evaluation in 20 healthy subjects, it is demonstrated that the present system can accurately detect the accident [60 / 60, 100 %] and show the good correlation between the pulse [r= 0. 99] and respiration [r= 0. 95] obtained from the system and those obtained from the conventional methods using the sensors attached to the body surface...|$|E
50|$|Whitener’s tufting {{industry}} eventually {{expanded to}} include <b>bath</b> <b>mats,</b> accent rugs, and carpets. Her carpets were especially successful, and her techniques were lasting. Today, over 90 percent of carpets produced in the U.S. today are tufted using Whitener’s early techniques. She never {{had the chance to}} make millions off the industry, however, many Georgia men and women did in later days. Dalton, Georgia, prior to the Silicon Valley boom, was the city with the most millionaires per capita in the United States; all part of Whitener’s legacy. Dalton became known as the “Carpet Industry of the World,” and in the 1990s, 90 percent of the world's carpets were being produced in or around this small city.|$|R
5000|$|In 1954, Louis Balsan succeeded to {{his cousin}} François. After he {{graduated}} from Sciences Po and Harvard, he was deported during the Second World War. He made contact with American factories specializing in TUFT, a new textile production process used for creating carpets, <b>bath</b> <b>mats,</b> bedspreads... The company then diversified its activities by manufacturing five meters tufted carpets with unique machines in France.The social development of the company continues {{with the introduction of}} paid internships and the construction of a day-nursery and a company restaurant. In 1972, Louis Balsan decides to build a new plant in Corbilly following the innovative concept of the era of [...] "plant in the countryside". After its opening in June 1974, the plant experiences some difficulties which lead Louis to sell Balsan to Bidermann Textile Group in May 1975.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} a {{bathroom}} must account {{for the use of}} both hot and cold water, in significant quantities, for cleaning the body. The water is also used for moving solid and liquid human waste to a sewer or septic tank. Water may be splashed on the walls and floor, and hot humid air may cause condensation on cold surfaces. From a decorating point of view the bathroom presents a challenge. Ceiling, wall and floor materials and coverings should be impervious to water and readily and easily cleaned. The use of ceramic or glass, as well as smooth plastic materials, is common in bathrooms for their ease of cleaning. Such surfaces are often cold to the touch, however, and so water-resistant <b>bath</b> <b>mats</b> or even bathroom carpets may be used on the floor to make the room more comfortable. Alternatively, the floor may be heated, possibly by strategically placing resistive electric mats under floor tile or radiant hot water tubing close to the underside of the floor surface.|$|R
40|$|Background This study {{aimed to}} {{simultaneously}} {{evaluate the effectiveness}} of a range of interventions to increase the possession of safety equipment or behaviours to prevent falls in children under 5 years of age in the home. Methods A recently published systematic review identified studies to be included in a network meta-analysis; an extension of pairwise meta-analysis that enables comparison of all evaluated interventions simultaneously, including comparisons not directly compared in individual studies. Results 29 primary studies were identified, of which 16 were included in at least 1 of 4 network meta-analyses. For increasing possession of a fitted stair gate, the most intensive intervention (including education, low cost/free home safety equipment, home safety inspection and fitting) was the most likely to be the most effective, with an OR versus usual care of 7. 80 (95 % CrI 3. 08 to 21. 3). For reducing possession or use of a baby walker: education only was most likely to be most effective, with an OR versus usual care of 0. 48 (95 % CrI 0. 31 to 0. 84). Little difference was found between interventions for possession of window locks (most intensive intervention versus usual care OR= 1. 56 (95 % CrI 0. 02 to 89. 8)) and for not leaving a child alone on a high surface (education vs usual care OR= 0. 89 (95 % CrI 0. 10 to 9. 67)). There was insufficient evidence for network meta-analysis for possession and use of <b>bath</b> <b>mats.</b> Conclusions These results will inform healthcare providers of the most effective components of interventions and can be used in cost-effectiveness analysesPeer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} a clean room mat is to keep sterile the areas that require {{ultimate}} protection from dirt, bacteria and any contamination brought from outside. Clean room mats are tacky, sticky, non slip mats that possess multiple layers of clean film that effectively capture dirt and dust from foot traffic and wheels. Peel-off mats {{are made up of}} multiple sheets of polyethylene film coated with acrylic adhesive that traps particles. Each layer peels off to reveal a new clean surface. The adhesive backing prevents microbial growth and contamination. Mats used outside clean rooms and laboratories are designed to withhold foreign pollution elements. This goal is achieved by a sticky surface that serves as a barrier for debris, dirt and dust adhered to shoe soles. Clean room sticky mats can contain two defensive barriers: the first part is a carpet itself, while the second part is sticky surface mat. Another mat type to be used to protect rooms from pollution is sanitizing foot <b>bath</b> floor <b>mats.</b> The mat itself is a small bath that contains sanitizing liquid. The foot bath bottom is covered with pliable rubber scrapers for effective cleaning of footwear soles while the liquid disinfects them.|$|R
40|$|Defect-free {{and highly}} {{homogeneous}} polyaniline (PANI) -Nylon 6 electrospun nanofibers are obtained through a solvent-induced segregation of N-phenyl- 1, 4 -phenylenediamine (ADPA) on a fiber surface {{followed by an}} oxidative surface polymerization onto a wire-shaped template. Different oxidation salts are tested both as additives of the spinning solutions and in a polymerization <b>bath.</b> Comparison between <b>mats</b> obtained with a solvent induced segregation process and classical feed solution electrospinning is highlighted. As a result, self-standing emeraldine base PANI (EB) membranes are produced both in this pristine state and in a doped emeraldine salt state (ES). The doping process is carried out in different acid baths, namely hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and p-toluene sulphonic acid, the last being the most effective. Wire-shaped PANI membranes are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the polymerization/doping states of PANI are monitored step by step by UV-vis reflectance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and contact angle measurements (CA) ...|$|R
5000|$|Since 2011 Sarı {{has been}} working on {{creating}} ceramics works that take advantage of the glow properties of the radioactive uranium silicates. Sarı {{has been working}} with technology and art in parallel implementing works of art by using the techniques of uranium silicate's phosphorus effects on porcelain bodies since 2011. According to Sarı, there are two shades of red (copper red and uranium red) that are very difficult to achieve in glaze and ceramics and that a small surface of uranium red can be produced by burning uranium nitrate in high temperature. He was able to experiment with radioactive rare elements during his PhD studies in Sofia and {{that he was able to}} successfully significantly reduce alpha particle radiation from glaze and ceramics using radioactive uranium by using lead and lithium oxide layer coating which is further coated by glass layers. On 30 November 2012 Sarı held a seminar on [...] "Uranium in Ceramic Art" [...] at Vuzf University and also held a solo exhibition demonstrating this work with red uranium. On 27 June 2012 Sarı gave a guest lecture and held a workshop on uses of rare elements in ceramic glazes and glass bodies, cromatic glazes, Turkish blue glaze, preparation of safety floric acid <b>bath</b> for <b>mat</b> glazing at University of Applied Arts Vienna. On 15 September 2012 Sarı presented his paper with the topic [...] "Uses of The Rare Elements into Ceramic Glazes and Glass Bodies" [...] in the Sixth International Eskişehir Terra Cotta Symposium where he discussed the behavior within glazed ceramic/porcelain bodies of attained rare earth elements.At 29 November 2016 Dr Sari made a solo seminar with workshop about U/V Glow Ceramic Glazes & Uranium Glass at Vilnius Academy of Arts Lithuania [...] On 8 February 2017 Dr.Sari opened the XXIII Annual Expert PhD seminar [...] "Inorganic Non-metallic Materials" [...] at the University of Chemical Technology, department of Glass and Ceramics in Prague, Czech Republic. In this seminar he presented his personal research [...] "Uranium Compounds in Art".|$|R
5000|$|We didn’t have to {{wait long}} before the next lorry arrived with fresh victims. It was {{specially}} constructed. It looked like a normal large lorry, in grey paint, with two hermetically closed rear doors. The inner walls were of steel metal. There weren’t any seats. The floor was covered by a wooden grating, as in public <b>baths,</b> with straw <b>mats</b> on top. Between the driver’s cab and the rear part were two peepholes. With a flashlight one could observe through these peepholes if the victims were already dead. Under the wooden grating were two tubes about [...] thick which {{came out of the}} cab. The tubes had small openings from which gas poured out. The gas generator was in the cab, where the same driver sat all the time. He wore a uniform of the SS death’s head units and was about forty years old. There were two such vans.When the lorries approached we had to stand at a distance of 5 m from the ditch. The leader of the guard detail was a high-ranking SS man, an absolute sadist and murderer. He ordered that eight men were to open the doors of the lorry. The smell of gas that met us was overpowering. [...] Wednesday, 7 January 1942.|$|R
40|$|The study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} immediate physical therapy on the functional recovery of hind limbs of dogs with experimental cranial cruciate ligament rupture which underwent surgical extracapsular stabilization {{as well as to}} verify its interference in joint stability. Eight dogs were randomly divided into two groups: GI (control) (n= 4) and GII (physical therapy) (n= 4). The dogs in GII underwent the following therapeutic treatments in the postoperative period: cryotherapy, passive joint movement, massage, passive straightening, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, hydrotherapy (<b>bath</b> and aquatic <b>mat)</b> and therapeutic exercises. We performed evaluations of the thigh circumference, goniometry, X-ray, and knee stability (drawer test). Results did not demonstrate {{a significant difference between the}} groups nor between different post-operative times. Regarding gait analysis, we found that the 4 dogs in GI remained in degree 3 of lameness 45 and 90 days postoperatively. However, in GII, one dog remained in degree 3 45 and 90 days after surgery; one dog changed from degree 3 to 4 90 days after surgery and the other 2 dogs changed from degree 3 to 5 90 days after surgery. It is possible to conclude that dogs with CCL rupture that undergo immediate physical therapy demonstrate better results in regards to functional gait recovery. The therapeutic modalities used in the immediate post-operative period did not cause instability of the operated knee. Further studies are needed with a larger number of dogs to indicate the immediate physical therapy in dogs with CCL ligament rupture which underwent extracapsular stabilization...|$|R
