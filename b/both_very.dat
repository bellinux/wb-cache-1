5|$|Alive or Just Breathing {{was mixed}} in February 2002 at Backstage Productions in Ripley, Derbyshire, UK by Andy Sneap. Dutkiewicz brought the album to the UK and oversaw the mixing process. The band chose Sneap after hearing {{good things about}} his work. The band and label were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> pleased with the mix, and Dutkiewicz in {{particular}} noted his satisfaction with the drum tones.|$|E
5|$|Bohr and Wheeler {{set to work}} {{applying}} the liquid drop model to explain the mechanism of nuclear fission. As the experimental physicists studied fission, they uncovered puzzling results. George Placzek asked Bohr why uranium seemed to fission with <b>both</b> <b>very</b> fast and very slow neutrons. Walking to a meeting with Wheeler, Bohr had an insight that the fission at low energies {{was due to the}} uranium-235 isotope, while at high energies it was mainly due to the far more abundant uranium-238 isotope. They co-wrote two more papers on fission. Their first paper appeared in Physical Review on September 1, 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland, starting World War II in Europe.|$|E

5000|$|Most notoriously, Young {{engaged in}} a public feud with New York Mets pitcher Tom Seaver, which contributed {{to one of the}} turning points in Mets history. After free agency came to baseball, Seaver {{publicly}} complained that Mets owner M. Donald Grant made no effort to sign any of the available players. Seaver was also renegotiating his own contract, and Grant portrayed his star pitcher as being motivated by money. Grant's most enthusiastic supporter in the press was Young, who wrote a series of blistering columns about Seaver, culminating on June 15, 1977. [...] "In a way", Young wrote, [...] "Tom Seaver is like Walter O'Malley. <b>Both</b> are <b>very</b> good at what they do. <b>Both</b> are <b>very</b> deceptive in what they say. <b>Both</b> are <b>very</b> greedy." ...|$|R
5|$|Accordingly, William de Valence {{began to}} build a much larger castle around the {{original}} keep from the 1280s onwards, demolishing Marshal's earlier work. As part of the extremely expensive construction work, Valence used oak trees drawn from several royal forests. Valence was building {{at the same time}} that his nephew Edward I was constructing his major castles in the north of Wales, and the concentric castle that he built at Goodrich is <b>both</b> <b>very</b> similar in design and a rarity in England itself. Valence's son, Aymer de Valence built an additional line of outer defences before his death in 1324, including the external barbican, inspired by that at the Tower of London, and for which the earlier Valence barbican at Pembroke may have been an experimental forerunner. The effect was an early success in converting a fortress into a major dwelling, without damaging its defensive arrangements, and influenced the later castle conversion at Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} Brierre's death, the detectives have made little {{progress}} on their lead about Kaja, the victim's abusive ex-boyfriend. Ballard and Gharty suggest they {{look more closely}} at Felix Wilson and his son, Hal (Jeffrey Wright), because Brierre had sex before her death and knew few men socially besides them. Pembleton and Gee, who are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> respectful of Felix Wilson's contributions to the African American community, dismiss the suggestion; Gee refuses to even ask the Wilsons to submit a blood and hair sample. The next day's Baltimore Sun runs a story about the investigation into Kaja, which Pembleton believes was leaked to the press by Gee in order to distance the Wilsons from the crime. Ballard and Gharty question Hal, who denies having sex with Brierre after tough questions from Gharty. After the interview, Gharty tells Ballard that Pembleton and Gee are obstructing the investigation to protect a rich and respected black family.|$|E

25|$|Theosophy and spiritualism were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> popular metaphysical {{schools of}} thought {{especially}} in the early 20th century and thus were always clashing in their different beliefs.

25|$|Hadza is a head-marking {{language}} in both clauses and noun phrases. Word order is flexible; the default constituent order is VSO, though VOS and fronting to SVO are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> common. The order of determiner, noun, and attributive also varies, though with morphological consequences. There is number and gender agreement on both attributives (for head nouns) and verbs (for subjects).|$|E

25|$|Nome has a subarctic climate (Köppen Dfc), with long, {{very cold}} winters, and short, cool summers. However, {{conditions}} in both winter and summer are moderated by the city's coastal location: winters are less severe {{than in the}} Interior, and conversely, summers are lukewarm. For example, Fairbanks at a similar parallel quite far inland has much greater temperature swings with <b>both</b> <b>very</b> warm and cold temperatures throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|Beloved and Sethe are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> much emotionally {{impaired}} as {{a result}} of Sethe’s previous enslavement. Slavery creates a situation where a mother is separated from her child, which has devastating consequences for both parties. Furthermore, the earliest need a child has is related to the mother: the baby needs milk from the mother. Sethe is traumatized by the experience of having her milk stolen because it means she cannot form the symbolic bond between herself and her daughter.|$|E
25|$|Though {{historically}} lightly populated, political Arabia {{is noted}} {{for a high}} population growth rate - {{as the result of}} <b>both</b> <b>very</b> strong inflows of migrant labor as well as sustained high birth rates. The population tends to be relatively young and heavily skewed gender ratio dominated by males. In many states, the number of South Asians exceeds that of the local citizenry. The four smallest states (by area), which have their entire coastlines on the Persian Gulf, exhibit the world's most extreme population growth, roughly tripling every 20 years.|$|E

25|$|Barnard 68 {{is a large}} dark nebula, located 410 {{light-years from}} Earth. Despite its {{diameter}} of 0.4 light-years, Barnard 68 only has twice {{the mass of the}} Sun, making it <b>both</b> <b>very</b> diffuse and very cold, with a temperature of about 16 kelvins. Though it is currently stable, Barnard 68 will eventually collapse, inciting the process of star formation. One unusual feature of Barnard 68 is its vibrations, which have a period of 250,000 years. Astronomers speculate that this phenomenon is caused by the shock wave from a supernova.|$|E

His counter-terrorism drama My Name Is Khan (2010) earned him his second Filmfare Award for Best Director. These, along with the several successful films he has produced under the Dharma Productions banner, have established {{him as one of}} the leading director-producers in Hindi cinema.|$|E
25|$|Data {{validity}} is {{an ongoing}} concern for life cycle analyses. Due to globalization and the rapid pace of research and development, new materials and manufacturing methods are continually being introduced to the market. This makes it <b>both</b> <b>very</b> important and very difficult to use up-to-date information when performing an LCA. If an LCA’s conclusions are to be valid, the data must be recent; however, the data-gathering process takes time. If a product and its related processes have not undergone significant revisions since the last LCA data was collected, data validity is not a problem. However, consumer electronics such as cell phones can be redesigned as often as every 9 to 12 months, creating a need for ongoing data collection.|$|E
