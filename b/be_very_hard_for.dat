25|$|This {{rejected}} the Aguilar–Spinelli test {{and put in}} place a totality-of-the-circumstances standard. This was put into place because the court recognized that there was more evidence that the Gateses were involved in drug trafficking than just the letter standing alone. The court agreed that if the letter had just stood alone it would not be probable cause to get a warrant. The court also recognized that under the Aguilar–Spinelli two-pronged test, it would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the “reliability” prong to ever be satisfied from an anonymous tip so it therefore should be abandoned.|$|E
25|$|When {{the polls}} {{around the country}} closed at 19:00 RTL and Nova TV {{published}} {{the results of the}} exit polls conducted by Ipsos PULS. They predicted a landslide win for Josipović, giving him an advantage of almost 30 percentage points, significantly larger than all of the second-round polls. This shifted much of the political commentary and rendered much of the expected drama moot. The Josipović headquarters started celebrating immediately after the polls closed claiming that the difference is too large for Bandić to overcome and the exit polls don't feature such a large statistical margin of error. The Bandić campaign said they'll wait for official results, but admitted it would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Bandić to overtake Josipović's 30 point lead even when the votes from abroad were tallied. The exit polls predicted the outcome well as the ratio between the two candidates was 9 to 1 for Bandić abroad, where there were no exit polls, which narrowed Josipović's victory to a final difference of 21 percentage points.|$|E
500|$|Urobuchi {{attributed}} {{his past}} experience working on projects with screenwriters Ichiro Itano and Yōsuke Kuroda {{as a major}} influence in his writing for Puella Magi Madoka Magica, and has referred {{to both of them}} as his mentors. To set the initial pacing of the series, Urobuchi used a technique he credited as originally from Kuroda. The first episode would throw the viewer into a specific part of the story with unknown context, the second episode would then define the particular rules governing the story's setting, and the third episode would be responsible for divulging the revelation in the plot so as to hook the viewer. The twist in the third episode was determined during the project proposal stage and involved the death of Mami, a main character figure. This decision was controversial, and Urobuchi recalled production staff members continually approaching him and asking him to reconsider due to their own fondness for the character. However, he refused and the plot remained unchanged during production. Nevertheless, Urobuchi realized that this progression could <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> viewers to accept and might hurt the overall series' success with some audiences, commenting: [...] "I always thought this is an age where entertainment basically is about soothing and healing, like adopting a style where unchanging day-to-day life is to continue forever." ...|$|E

[...] Regarding the old practices, Tsai stated that “If we keep sticking to these past practices and ways of thinking, it will probably <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> us {{to deal with the}} volatile regional situations in Asia”.

2500|$|Biographer Randall Woods {{argues that}} Social Gospel themes Johnson learned from {{childhood}} {{allowed him to}} transform social problems into moral problems. This helps explain his longtime commitment to social justice, as exemplified by the Great Society and his commitment to racial equality. The Social Gospel explicitly inspired his foreign-policy approach {{to a sort of}} Christian internationalism and nation building. For example, in a 1966 speech he quoted at length from the Social Creed of the Methodist Church issued in 1940, adding [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> me to write a more perfect description of the American ideal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Foraging for {{invertebrate}} prey on {{the ground}} often involves gleaning the leaf litter of the forest floor, sometimes flicking, flipping, or scratching through dead leaves. Birds can use their bills to flick or toss dead leaves from the ground to reveal prey residing beneath. The leaftossers of Central and South America and the pittas and laughingthrushes of Asia do this. An example of a bird that employs flipping is the ovenbird, a species of North American wood-warbler. It deliberately turns over leaves {{on the ground}} to search for spiders, worms, and such underneath. [...] In other parts of the world, similar leaf-flipping behavior has been observed in unrelated birds, such as the jungle babbler of India. Some birds, such as hummingbirds, will use their wings to create a blast of air to roll leaves over. Other birds rake a foot through the leaf litter, like a chicken, for the same purpose. This has been observed in buttonquails. Some American sparrows, such as the green-tailed towhee, perform a double-scratch by raking both legs simultaneously through the leaf-litter. They then catch prey items dislodged by the disturbance. Ground-foraging birds can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> humans to observe, as they often occupy densely vegetated habitat, {{as in the case of}} the Bornean wren-babbler, which specializes in gleaning leaf litter in gullies in the forest of Southeast Asia.|$|E
