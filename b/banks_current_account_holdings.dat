40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{two opposing}} views on global imbalances: The "traditional view", which regards the imbalances {{as a threat}} to global economic and financial stability, and the "new paradigm" view, which considers that they are the natural consequence of economic and financial globalization. In terms of their policy implications, the traditional view focuses on monetary and fiscal policy decisions in the United States that need to be urgently reversed to avoid an abrupt unwinding of the imbalances involving a sell-off of dollar assets, a sharp increase in U. S. interest rates, and a hard landing for the global economy. By contrast, the new paradigm view considers that the imbalances will be resolved smoothly through the normal functioning of markets.

50|$|According to the Bank of Japan, {{the central}} bank adopted {{quantitative}} easing on 19 March 2001. Under quantitative easing, the BOJ flooded commercial banks with excess liquidity to promote private lending, leaving them with large stocks of excess reserves and therefore little risk of a liquidity shortage. The BOJ accomplished this by buying more government bonds than {{would be required to}} set the interest rate to zero. It later also bought asset-backed securities and equities and extended the terms of its commercial paper-purchasing operation. The BOJ increased the commercial <b>bank</b> <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balance from ¥5 trillion to ¥35 trillion (approximately US$300 billion) over a four-year period starting in March 2001. The BOJ also tripled the quantity of long-term Japan government bonds it could purchase on a monthly basis.|$|R
40|$|Concentrated {{distribution}} of international reserves is puzzling. I {{show that the}} growth rates of international reserves bear only a very weak relationship to their initial stocks (scaled by GDP or in absolute terms), and that, by implication, the cross-sectional {{distribution of}} reserves conforms to Zipf''s law. The law states {{that the size of}} reserves is inversely related to their ranking. Evidence in favor of the law is strong and time robust. I compare the crosssection distribution of international reserves embedded in the WEO projections to that implied by Zipf''s law and find that international reserves are much less concentrated in the WEO projections than implied by Zipf''s law.
