5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E

25|$|Whether {{there is}} any {{historical}} reality behind the Trojan War remains an open question. Many scholars <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a historical core to the tale, though this may simply mean that the Homeric stories are a fusion of various tales of sieges and expeditions by Mycenaean Greeks during the Bronze Age. Those {{who believe that the}} stories of the Trojan War are derived from a specific historical conflict usually date it to the 12th or 11th centuries BC, often preferring the dates given by Eratosthenes, 1194–1184 BC, which roughly corresponds with archaeological evidence of a catastrophic burning of Troy VIIa.|$|E

25|$|Khaled Abou El Fadl {{claims that}} the verses (88:21–22) {{emphasizes}} that even Muhammad {{does not have the}} right to think of himself as a warden who has the power to coerce people. This is reaffirmed by many of the historical reports regarding the Qur'anic revelation that emphasize that belief and conviction cannot be coerced. He further states that moderates consider the verse (2:256) to be enunciating a general, overriding principle that cannot be contradicted by isolated traditions attributed to the Prophet. He concludes that moderates do not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> any punishment that attaches to apostasy.|$|E
25|$|Wisdom teeth become {{impacted}} {{when there}} is not enough room in the jaws to allow for all of the teeth to erupt into the mouth. Because the wisdom teeth are the last to erupt, due to insufficient room in the jaws to accommodate more teeth, the wisdom teeth become stuck in the jaws, i.e., impacted. There is a genetic predisposition to tooth impaction. Genetics plays an important, albeit unpredictable role in dictating jaw and tooth size and tooth eruption potential of the teeth. Some also <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an evolutionary decrease in jaw size due to softer modern diets that are more refined and less coarse than our ancestors'.|$|E
25|$|Causal {{determinism}} is {{the concept}} that events within a given paradigm are bound by causality {{in such a way}} that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> nothing uncaused or self-caused. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. Quantum mechanics poses a serious challenge to this view.|$|E

25|$|Hence in {{accordance}} with the natural karmic laws, consequences occur when one utters a lie, steals something, commits acts of senseless violence or leads the life of a debauchee. Rather than assume that moral rewards and retribution are the work of a divine judge, the Jains <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an innate moral order to the cosmos, self-regulating through the workings of karma. Morality and ethics are important, not because of the personal whim of a fictional god, but because a life that is led in agreement with moral and ethical principles is beneficial: it leads to a decrease and finally to the total loss of karma, which means: to ever increasing happiness.|$|E
25|$|Much {{recent work}} has been done to {{identify}} the underlying causes of conversion and related disorders and to better understand why conversion and hysteria appear more commonly in women. Current theoreticians tend to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no single cause for these disorders. Instead, the emphasis tends to be on the individual understanding of the patient and a variety of therapeutic techniques. In some cases, the onset of conversion disorder correlates to a traumatic or stressful event. There are also certain populations that are considered at risk for conversion disorder, including people suffering from a medical illness or condition, people with personality disorder, and individuals with dissociative identity disorder. However, no biomarkers have yet been found to support the idea that conversion disorder is caused by a psychiatric condition.|$|E
25|$|Most {{countries}} {{participating in}} the negotiations <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> some economic benefit in adopting the agreement; however, there is considerable disagreement of how much benefit the agreement would actually produce. A study by the University of Michigan found that if all trade barriers in agriculture, services, and manufactures were reduced by 33% {{as a result of}} the Doha Development Agenda, there would be an increase in global welfare of $574.0billion. A 2008 study by World Bank Lead Economist Kym Anderson found that global income could increase by more than $3000billion per year, $2500billion of which would go to the developing world. Others had been predicting more modest outcomes, e.g. world net welfare gains ranging from $84billion to $287billion by the year 2015. Pascal Lamy has conservatively estimated that the deal will bring an increase of $130billion.|$|E
