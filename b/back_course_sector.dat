50|$|<b>Course</b> <b>sector</b> (CS) is {{the sector}} in the {{vertical}} plane bounded by DDM = 0.155.|$|R
50|$|These {{approaches}} {{include a}} localizer approach, localizer/DME approach, localizer <b>back</b> <b>course</b> approach, and a localizer-type directional aid (LDA). In cases where an ILS is installed, a <b>back</b> <b>course</b> {{may be available}} {{in conjunction with the}} localizer. Reverse sensing occurs on the <b>back</b> <b>course</b> using standard VOR equipment. With a horizontal situation indicator (HSI) system, reverse sensing is eliminated if it is set appropriately to the front course.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{localizer}} antennas {{are highly}} directional. However, usage of older, less directional antennas allows a runway {{to have a}} non-precision approach called a localizer <b>back</b> <b>course.</b> This lets aircraft land using the signal transmitted {{from the back of}} the localizer array. Highly directional antennas do not provide a sufficient signal to support a <b>back</b> <b>course.</b> In the United States, <b>back</b> <b>course</b> approaches are typically associated with Category I systems at smaller airports that do not have an ILS on both ends of the primary runway. Pilots flying a <b>back</b> <b>course</b> should disregard any glide slope indication.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>back</b> <b>course</b> marker (BC) {{normally}} {{indicates the}} ILS <b>back</b> <b>course</b> {{final approach fix}} where approach descent is commenced. Its is identified by pairs of morse-code [...] "dots" [...] at 3000 Hz (95 pairs per minute), which will trigger the white light on a marker beacon indicator, but with a different audio rhythm from an inner marker or en route marker.|$|R

50|$|The {{course was}} a 1.5 km swim, 40 km bike, 10 km run. The swim {{took place in}} Lake Geneva, {{starting}} next to the de Coubertin sporting complex.

25|$|The {{crash site}} was within {{international}} waters, but the National Transportation Safety Board carried out an investigation, {{which was published}} on July 1, 1970. The report stated the probable cause as improper crew resource management and stated that the aircraft was fully capable of carrying out the approach and landing. The aircraft was conducting an instrument approach, but was following an unauthorized <b>back</b> <b>course</b> approach.|$|R
5000|$|The race is {{run on a}} 50 mi out and <b>back</b> <b>course,</b> {{starting}} and finishing in downtown Leadville, Colorado, United States, at 10200 ft elevation. Major climbs include an over 3000 ft ascent from miles 40-50 to the Columbine mine, Powerline at mile 80, and St Kevins at mile 86. Total elevation gain is somewhere around 11000 ft when verified by GPS tracks of past competitors. http://app.strava.com/segments/715749 ...|$|R
40|$|So far, {{e-learning}} has primarily {{been used}} {{when there are}} many learners involved. The up-front investments related to e-learning are relatively high, and {{may be perceived as}} prohibitive for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Some e-learning is, however, getting less expensive, and some e-learning models are more suited for small-scale training than others. Therefore, this article presents some e-learning experiences derived from case studies of eighteen enterprises in eight European countries. The case studies represent small, medium-sized and large enterprises as well as e-learning providers. The analysis suggests that SMEs could use e-learning successfully based on three different types of courses: Generic <b>courses,</b> <b>sector</b> <b>courses</b> and internal courses. The small enterprises have so few employees that they are most likely to enrol individual students in generic courses. The medium-sized enterprises may also benefit from more specialized <b>sector</b> <b>courses</b> offered through a branch association or in cooperation with suppliers or chains. Large enterprises may have enough resources to develop e-learning courses internally. The e-learning providers are SMEs that may be especially interesting as examples of how other enterprises may use e-learning in the future. The article concludes with a number of success factors and advantage...|$|R

Although there have been minor modifications in the course over the years, it continues the tradition of offering a route that connects the two former cities of Fort William and Port Arthur.

5000|$|The {{difference}} in the depth of modulation or DDM is used by instrument landing systems {{in conjunction with the}} associated airborne receiving equipment to define a position in airspace. DDM is usually expressed in percentage but may also be expressed in microamperes. Instrument landing system ground stations provide radio frequency signals that vary linearly in the depth of modulation from the centre or course line at a rate of 0.145% per meter [...] The two individual audio modulation frequencies and their associated sidebands are 150Hz and 90Hz. The DDM for a localizer at the outer extremity of the <b>course</b> <b>sector</b> is 15.5% or an electric current equivalent of 150 microamperes half-scale deflection.|$|R
50|$|A multi-configuration road {{course is}} planned. The 3.2 km (2 mile) FIM/FIA track will {{incorporate}} the oval through tunnels {{in and out}} under the back straight of the oval. This design will be unique in providing a “stadium section” for the road course that will utilize the permanent seating of the oval. The elevations of the site will allow the spectators in the oval grandstand to see the oval section {{as well as the}} back section of the road course. A second configuration will separate from the oval, and use only the back section of the road course to allow the oval and <b>back</b> road <b>course</b> to be used independently. A 2nd paddock area will be built along the longest straight to accommodate the <b>back</b> <b>course.</b> The road course paddock area will also be the location of light industrial buildings for race teams and motorsport related shops.|$|R

5000|$|The {{horizontal}} situation indicator (commonly {{called the}} HSI) is an aircraft flight instrument normally mounted below the artificial horizon {{in place of a}} conventional heading indicator. It combines a heading indicator with a VHF omnidirectional range-instrument landing system (VOR-ILS) display. This reduces pilot workload by lessening the number of elements in the pilot's instrument scan to the six basic flight instruments. Among other advantages, the HSI offers freedom from the confusion of reverse sensing on an instrument landing system localizer <b>back</b> <b>course</b> approach. As long as the needle is set to the localizer front course, the instrument will indicate whether to fly left or right, in either direction of travel.|$|R
