500|$|In a brief review, Vincent Canby {{wrote that}} it was [...] "not exactly incoherent, <b>but</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> {{originally}} had on its mind seems to have slipped away". Leonard Maltin wrote that the film is [...] "more interesting visually than Bakshi's other later films, [...] but as entertainment it's vulgar and pointless." ...|$|E
500|$|John Gielgud's New Theatre {{production}} in 1935 featured Gielgud and Laurence Olivier as Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six {{weeks into the}} run, with Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet. Gielgud used a scholarly combination of Q1 and Q2 texts and organised the set and costumes to match {{as closely as possible}} to the Elizabethan period. His efforts were a huge success at the box office, and set the stage for increased historical realism in later productions. Olivier later compared his performance and Gielgud's: [...] "John, all spiritual, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity... I've always felt that John missed the lower half and that made me go for the other... <b>But</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> was, when I was playing Romeo I was carrying a torch, I was trying to sell realism in Shakespeare." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, U2 {{started work}} on the {{follow-up}} to How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), collaborating with producer Rick Rubin. After U2 guitarist the Edge worked individually with Rubin in Los Angeles, the group spent two weeks in September 2006 completing songs with the producer at Abbey Road Studios in London. Later that year, the band released two songs from these sessions on the compilation album U218 Singles: a cover of the Skids' [...] "The Saints Are Coming" [...] with Green Day, and [...] "Window in the Skies". In January 2007, lead singer Bono said U2 intended to take their next album in a different musical direction from their previous few releases. He said, [...] "We're gonna {{continue to be a}} band, but maybe the rock will have to go; maybe the rock has to get a lot harder. <b>But</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> is, it's not gonna stay where it is." ...|$|E

500|$|Hey Good Lookin {{opened in}} New York City on October 1, 1982, and was {{released}} in Los Angeles in January 1983. The film's release was limited, and went largely unnoticed in the United States, although it garnered respectable business in foreign markets. In a brief review, Vincent Canby wrote that it was [...] "not exactly incoherent, <b>but</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> originally had on its mind seems to have slipped away". Animation historian Jerry Beck wrote, [...] "the beginning {{of the film is}} quite promising, with a garbage can discussing life on the streets with some garbage. This is an example of what Bakshi did best—using the medium of animation to comment on society. Unfortunately, he doesn't do it enough in this film. There is a wildly imaginative fantasy sequence during the climax, when the character named Crazy starts hallucinating during a rooftop shooting spree. This scene almost justifies the whole film. But otherwise, this is a rehash of ideas better explored in Coonskin, Heavy Traffic, and Fritz the Cat." [...] The film has since gained a cult following through cable television and home video. Quentin Tarantino stated that he preferred Hey Good Lookin to Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets.|$|E
2500|$|Cohn aided Roger Stone in Ronald Reagan's presidential {{campaign}} in 1979–80. Cohn helped Stone arrange for John B. Anderson {{to get the}} nomination of the Liberal Party of New York, {{a move that would}} help split the opposition to Reagan in the state. Stone said Cohn gave him a suitcase that Stone avoided opening and, as instructed by Cohn, dropped it off at the office of a lawyer influential in Liberal Party circles. Reagan carried the state with 46 percent of the vote. Speaking after the statute of limitations for bribery had expired, Stone said, [...] "I paid his law firm. Legal fees. I don't know what he did for the money, <b>but</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> was, the Liberal party reached its right conclusion out of a matter of principle." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gibson gained very {{favorable}} notices from film critics {{when he first}} entered the cinematic scene, as well as comparisons to several classic movie stars. In 1982, Vincent Canby wrote that [...] "Mr. Gibson recalls the young Steve McQueen... I can't define 'star quality,' <b>but</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> is, Mr. Gibson has it." [...] Gibson has also been likened to [...] "a combination Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart." [...] Gibson's roles in the Mad Max series of films, Peter Weir's Gallipoli, and the Lethal Weapon series of films earned him the label of [...] "action hero". Later, Gibson expanded {{into a variety of}} acting projects including human dramas such as Hamlet, and comedic roles such as those in Maverick and What Women Want. He expanded beyond acting into directing and producing, with: The Man Without a Face, in 1993; Braveheart, in 1995; The Passion of the Christ, in 2004; and Apocalypto, in 2006. Jess Cagle of Time compared Gibson with Cary Grant, Sean Connery, and Robert Redford. Connery once suggested Gibson should play the next James Bond to Connery's M. Gibson turned down the role, reportedly because he feared being typecast.|$|E

2500|$|On November 22, 2013, T.I. {{announced}} that he had signed a deal with Columbia Records, to release his upcoming ninth studio album. T.I. later clarified the deal is solely for his ninth album. T.I. revealed he recruited Pharrell Williams, who was influential in his move to Columbia, to executive produce the LP, with plans to release the album in early 2014. In December 2013, T.I. revealed although he had originally planned to release Trouble Man II, since getting into the studio with the album's executive producer, Pharrell Williams, he had a change of heart. He stated: [...] "Since we started working on the project and the project started has taken a different shape, I think we're going to postpone that title. We're gonna rework that. I got a couple of things in mind." [...] He still plans to release the sequel to Trouble Man, however, he said: [...] "All I'ma say is, it's gonna be a motion picture, it's gonna be a theatrical-worthy title. Something that will definitely seem instant classic. I'm thinking something like 'Trap Champion', 'Paperwork,' <b>but</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> is the subtitle will be 'The Motion Picture'." [...] On December 16, 2013, it was reported that T.I. decided to name it Paperwork.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the authors}} that {{provoked}} the writing of The Freedom of the Will was Daniel Whitby. Whitby was an Arminian minister of the Church of England who {{was known for his}} anti-Calvinist viewpoint and his statement that “It is better to deny prescience foreknowledge than liberty.” It is this claim that Edwards attempts to answer in The Freedom of the Will. Edwards responded that a person may freely choose <b>whatever</b> seems good, <b>but</b> that <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> is that seems good is based on an inherent predisposition that has been foreordained by God.|$|R
