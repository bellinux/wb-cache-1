During <b>busy</b> and <b>peak</b> <b>periods,</b> the eastern part of this field, separated by a line of 2 ft posts, is used as the over-flow car park. There are two purpose built barbecue plinths which when rented from the wardens are supplied with a grill in this area. This area is of very little ecological value and is one of the most popular areas for visitors with children.|$|R

30|$|The SEM {{confirms}} {{the dominance of}} weekday travel variable in predicting <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> traffic.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{spectral}} <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> has been evaluated by varying the spectral <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> for a constant wave height. It is found a close correlation between the pitch motion amplitude ratio and the extremal snap-load. For the fixed platform, the maximum snap-load occurs for a spectral <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> of 9 seconds: the same spectral <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> as for the maximum pitch motion amplitude ratio. For the floating platform the maximum snap-load occurs for a wider range between 9 and 11 seconds. A limitation of the increased lifting potential by adding the spectral <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> in the load charts, are the maximum snap-loads occuring for the most common spectral <b>peak</b> <b>periods</b> in the North-Sea.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper aims {{to reflect}} the {{severity}} of congestion by the duration of <b>peak</b> <b>period.</b> Two thresholds, the minimum value in the peak hour and 95 percent of peak hour volume respectively, were chosen to define the <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> using archived stop-bar detector data. The thresholds and the time-granularity of the data were cross-compared to choose appropriate threshold and data time interval. Then the measures of duration of <b>peak</b> <b>period,</b> including the length of <b>peak</b> <b>period,</b> the beginning and ending time of <b>peak</b> <b>period,</b> were calculated for different signalized intersections inlet approaches. Further, the measures of <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> of different intersections {{in the same direction}} of the same radial road were presented to find out the commute traffic patterns. Lastly, the spatial-temporal association pattern of the measures of <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> of different intersections in downtown Shanghai was performed by ArcGIS...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the case}} of peak spreading, the {{traditional}} static analysis on the duration of congestion using peak 15 minutes of hour has lost its meaning. To deal with congestion, we need dynamic analysis on the onset and dissipation of congestion. This paper aims to reflect the severity of congestion, even the spatial interaction of congestion, by the relative size of <b>peak</b> <b>period.</b> Two thresholds, the minimum value in the peak hour and 95 percent of peak hour volume respectively, were chosen to define the peak using archived stop-bar detector data. The thresholds and the time-granularity of the data were cross-compared to choose appropriate threshold and data time interval, {{and the result is}} 95 percent of peak hour volume under 10 min interval data. Then the measures of duration of <b>peak</b> <b>period,</b> including the length of <b>peak</b> <b>period,</b> the beginning and ending time of <b>peak</b> <b>period,</b> were calculated for different signalized intersections inlet approaches. Further, the measures of <b>peak</b> <b>period</b> of different intersections in the same direction of the same radial road were presented to find out the commute traffic patterns.
