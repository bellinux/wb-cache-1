5|$|An RNA {{thermometer}} (or RNA thermosensor) is a temperature-sensitive non-coding RNA molecule which regulates gene expression. RNA thermometers often regulate genes required during {{either a}} heat shock or cold shock response, <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> implicated in other regulatory roles {{such as in}} pathogenicity and starvation.|$|E

5|$|Arsenic {{compounds}} such as {{sodium arsenite}} or sodium arsenate are effective flame retardants for wood <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> less frequently used {{due to their}} toxicity. Antimony trioxide is a flame retardant. Aluminium hydroxide {{has been used as}} a wood-fibre, rubber, plastic and textile flame retardant since the 1890s. Apart from aluminium hydroxide, use of phosphorus based flame-retardants—in the form of, for example, organophosphates—now exceeds that of any of the other main retardant types. These employ boron, antimony or halogenated hydrocarbon compounds.|$|E
5|$|Despite being bred for racing, Whippets can be couch potatoes. When {{not running}} around, {{they are usually}} asleep or cuddled in their owner's lap. They are not prone to {{fighting}} <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> known to chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. They also {{have a tendency to}} get up on furniture. Whippets are touch sensitive, meaning that they tend to jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|Few {{buildings}} are {{left on the}} north side of the highway. The most notable are the wooden Southern Pacific saltbox-style section house and workers' bunkhouse, both built in 1887.

Three extant farmworkers' bungalows, built by the Del Valle family in 1916, are located west of the section house.|$|E

5|$|Interpretations vary. The canvas {{seems to}} portray {{simultaneously}} a dreaming {{woman and the}} content of her nightmare. The incubus and horse's head refer to contemporary belief and folklore about nightmares, <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> ascribed more specific meanings by some theorists. Contemporary critics were taken aback by the overt sexuality of the painting, since interpreted by some scholars as anticipating Jungian ideas about the unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Over 270 {{bird species}} have been {{observed}} in central Idaho, including 36 accidental species – {{those that are not}} normally found in the region <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> observed on at least one occasion. Golden eagles and greater sage-grouse can be found over sagebrush steppe, whereas bald eagles can be seen along rivers. The Forest Service has listed northern goshawks, flammulated owls, and white-headed woodpeckers as a sensitive species in the forest.|$|E
5|$|While breathing, {{they hold}} just their {{nostrils}} above the surface, sometimes standing on their tails to do so. Sirenians typically inhabit warm, shallow, coastal waters, or rivers. They are mainly herbivorous, <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> known to consume {{animals such as}} birds and jellyfish. Males typically mate {{with more than one}} female (polygyny), and may participate in lek mating. Sirenians are K-selectors, and display parental care.|$|E

5|$|Coyote {{attacks on}} humans are {{uncommon}} and rarely cause serious injuries, {{due to the}} relatively small size of the coyote, <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> increasingly frequent, especially in California. There have been two confirmed fatal attacks: one on a three-year-old named Kelly Keen in Glendale, California and another on a nineteen-year-old named Taylor Mitchell in Nova Scotia, Canada. In the 30 {{years leading up to}} March 2006, at least 160 attacks occurred in the United States, mostly in the Los Angeles County area. Data from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife Services, the California Department of Fish and Game, and other sources show that while 41 attacks occurred during the period of 1988–1997, 48 attacks were verified from 1998 through 2003. The majority of these incidents occurred in Southern California near the suburban-wildland interface.|$|E
5|$|Megami Tensei, marketed {{overseas}} as Shin Megami Tensei (originally Revelations), is a Japanese media franchise {{created by}} Kouji Okada (credited as Cozy Okada in English), Ginichiro Suzuki, and Kazunari Suzuki. Primarily developed by Atlus and currently owned by Sega, the franchise consists of multiple subseries and covers multiple role-playing genres including tactical role-playing, action role-playing, and massively multiplayer online role-playing. The first two {{titles in the}} series were published by Bandai Namco (then Namco), <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> almost always published by Atlus in Japan and North America since the release of Shin Megami Tensei. For Europe, Atlus publishes the games through third-party companies.|$|E
5|$|Nihonium is {{expected}} to be much denser than thallium, having a predicted density of about 16 to 18g/cm3, due to the relativistic stabilization and contraction of its 7s and 7p1/2 orbitals. This is because calculations estimate it to have an atomic radius of about 170pm, {{the same as that of}} thallium, even though periodic trends would predict it to have an atomic radius larger than that of thallium due to it being one period further down in the periodic table. The melting and boiling points of nihonium are not definitely known, <b>but</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> calculated to be 430°C and 1100°C respectively, exceeding the values for gallium, indium, and thallium, following periodic trends.|$|E
