5|$|<b>Behavioral</b> therapy may {{be useful}} for chronic pain. There are several types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive <b>behavioral</b> therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of <b>behavioral</b> therapies. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests that it {{may be useful}} in improving the acceptance of existing pain.|$|E
5|$|Many species {{make use}} of <b>behavioral</b> {{strategies}} to deter predators.|$|E
5|$|A notable recent {{development}} in Philosophy of Psychology is Functional Contextualism or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism {{is a modern}} philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism. It is most actively developed in <b>behavioral</b> science in general, the field of behavior analysis, and contextual <b>behavioral</b> science in particular (see the entry for the Association for Contextual <b>Behavioral</b> Science). Functional contextualism serves {{as the basis of}} a theory of language known as relational frame theory and its most prominent application, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism first delineated by Steven C. Hayes which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study by}} He et al. used a simple {{epidemic}} model, to incorporate three factors including school opening and closing, temperature changes {{over the course}} of the outbreak, and human <b>behavioral</b> changes in response to the outbreak to infer the cause of the three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Their modelling results showed that all three factors are important but human <b>behavioral</b> responses showed the largest effects.|$|E

5|$|Irving Isadore Gottesman (December 29, 1930 – June 29, 2016) was an American {{professor}} of psychology who devoted {{most of his career}} {{to the study of the}} genetics of schizophrenia. He wrote 17 books and more than 290 other publications, mostly on schizophrenia and <b>behavioral</b> genetics, and created the first academic program on <b>behavioral</b> genetics in the United States. He won awards such as the Hofheimer Prize for Research, the highest award from the American Psychiatric Association for psychiatric research. Lastly, Gottesman was a professor in the psychology department at the University of Minnesota, where he received his Ph.D.|$|E
5|$|Marian's {{graduate}} studies had stopped {{when she and}} Keller left to found ABE. Marian now returned to graduate school and earned her Ph.D. in Psychology at the University of Arkansas in 1978. She then served {{as a professor of}} psychology at Henderson State University from 1981 until her retirement in 1998. During these years, the Baileys produced educational films on topics such as the history of behaviorism. Their film work included The History of <b>Behavioral</b> Analysis Biographies, the ABE documentary Patient Like the Chipmunks, and An Apple for the Student: How <b>Behavioral</b> Psychology Can Change the American Classroom.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms of Huntington's disease most {{commonly}} become noticeable {{between the ages}} of 35 and 44years, but they can begin at any age from infancy to old age. In the early stages, there are subtle changes in personality, cognition, and physical skills. The physical symptoms are usually the first to be noticed, as cognitive and <b>behavioral</b> symptoms are generally not severe enough to be recognized on their own at the earlier stages. Almost everyone with Huntington's disease eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but the onset, progression and extent of cognitive and <b>behavioral</b> symptoms vary significantly between individuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} was formerly called 'Huntington's chorea' but this term {{has been replaced}} by 'Huntington's disease' because not all patients develop chorea and due to the importance of cognitive and <b>behavioral</b> problems.|$|E

25|$|A {{strand of}} <b>behavioral</b> finance {{has been dubbed}} Quantitative <b>Behavioral</b> Finance, which uses {{mathematical}} and statistical methodology to understand <b>behavioral</b> biases in conjunction with valuation. Some of these endeavors has been led by Gunduz Caginalp (Professor of Mathematics and Editor of Journal of <b>Behavioral</b> Finance during 2001-2004) and collaborators including Vernon Smith (2002 Nobel Laureate in Economics), David Porter, Don Balenovich, Vladimira Ilieva, Ahmet Duran). Studies by Jeff Madura, Ray Sturm and others have demonstrated significant <b>behavioral</b> effects in stocks and exchange traded funds. Among other topics, quantitative <b>behavioral</b> finance studies <b>behavioral</b> effects together with the non-classical assumption of the finiteness of assets.|$|E

25|$|<b>Behavioral</b> {{economics}} is {{primarily concerned with}} the bounds of rationality of economic agents. <b>Behavioral</b> models typically integrate insights from psychology, neuroscience, and microeconomic theory; in so doing, these <b>behavioral</b> models cover a range of concepts, methods, and fields.|$|E
25|$|The Institute for <b>Behavioral</b> Genetics (IBG) is a {{research}} institute within the Graduate School dedicated to conducting and facilitating research on the genetic and environmental bases of individual differences in behavior. After its founding in 1967 IBG led the resurging interest in genetic influences on behavior. IBG was the first post-world war II research institute dedicated to research in <b>behavioral</b> genetics. IBG {{remains one of the}} top research facilities for research in <b>behavioral</b> genetics, including human <b>behavioral</b> genetics, psychiatric genetics, quantitative genetics, statistical genetics, and animal <b>behavioral</b> genetics.|$|E
25|$|Other {{proponents of}} <b>behavioral</b> {{economics}} note that neoclassical models {{often fail to}} predict outcomes in real world contexts. <b>Behavioral</b> insights can influence neoclassical models. <b>Behavioral</b> economists note that these revised models not only reach the same correct predictions as the traditional models, but also correctly predict some outcomes where the traditional models failed. The epistemological, ontological, and methodological components of <b>behavioral</b> economics are increasingly debated, in particular by historians of economics and economic methodologists.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{show that}} {{bedwetting}} {{children are more}} likely to have <b>behavioral</b> problems. For children who have developmental problems, the <b>behavioral</b> problems and the bedwetting are frequently part of/caused by the developmental issues. For bedwetting children without other developmental issues, these <b>behavioral</b> issues can result from self-esteem issues and stress caused by the wetting.|$|E
25|$|Rabin dismisses these criticisms, {{claiming}} that consistent results are typically obtained in multiple situations and geographies and can produce good theoretical insight. <b>Behavioral</b> economists have also responded to these criticisms {{by focusing on}} field studies rather than lab experiments. Some economists see a fundamental schism between experimental economics and <b>behavioral</b> economics, but prominent <b>behavioral</b> and experimental economists tend to share techniques and approaches in answering common questions. For example, <b>behavioral</b> economists are investigating neuroeconomics, which is entirely experimental and cannot yet be verified in the field.|$|E

25|$|In initial studies, {{cognitive}} therapy was often contrasted with <b>behavioral</b> treatments {{to see which}} was most effective. During the 1980s and 1990s, cognitive and <b>behavioral</b> techniques were merged into cognitive <b>behavioral</b> therapy. Pivotal to this merging was the successful development of treatments for panic disorder by David M. Clark in the UK and David H. Barlow in the US.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{concern is}} that despite {{a great deal of}} rhetoric, there is no real {{consistent}} <b>behavioral</b> theory yet. <b>Behavioral</b> economics scholars also have no unified theory. Until that happens, it is a collection of loosely related or unrelated observations. What is missing is a foundational <b>behavioral</b> theory that can be tested in many domains as a competitor to neoclassical theory.|$|E
25|$|This {{is related}} to {{autonomous}} foraging, a concern within the sciences of <b>behavioral</b> ecology, social anthropology, and human <b>behavioral</b> ecology; as well as robotics, artificial intelligence, and artificial life.|$|E
25|$|<b>Behavioral</b> Investment Theory (BIT) is {{proposed}} as a merger {{of the selection}} science of behaviorism with the information science of cognitive neuroscience (notice the parallel with the modern synthesis). BIT posits that the nervous system evolved as an increasingly flexible computational control system that coordinates the <b>behavioral</b> expenditure of energy of the animal as a whole. Expenditure of <b>behavioral</b> energy is theorized to be computed on an investment value system built evolutionarily through natural selection operating on genetic combinations and ontogenetically through <b>behavioral</b> selection operating on neural combinations. As such, the current <b>behavioral</b> investments of the animal are conceptualized as the joint product of the two vectors of phylogeny and ontogeny. A unique element of BIT is that it finds a core of agreement and builds bridges between five brain-behavior paradigms: (1) cognitive science; (2) <b>behavioral</b> science; (3) evolutionary theory and genetics; (4) neuroscience; and (5) cybernetics/systems theory.|$|E
25|$|<b>Behavioral</b> traditions {{have been}} {{observed}} in groups of fish, birds, and mammals. Groups of orangutans and chimpanzees, in particular, may display large numbers of <b>behavioral</b> traditions, and in chimpanzees, transfer of traditional behavior from one group to another (not just within a group) has been observed. Such <b>behavioral</b> traditions may have evolutionary significance, allowing adaptation {{at a faster rate}} than genetic change.|$|E
25|$|Quantitative <b>behavioral</b> finance uses {{mathematical}} {{and statistical}} methodology to understand <b>behavioral</b> biases. In marketing research, a study shows {{little evidence that}} escalating biases impact marketing decisions. Leading contributors include Gunduz Caginalp (Editor of the Journal of <b>Behavioral</b> Finance from 2001–04), and collaborators include 2002 Nobel Laureate Vernon Smith, David Porter, Don Balenovich, Vladimira Ilieva and Ahmet Duran, and Ray Sturm.|$|E
25|$|From {{the applied}} {{behavior}} analysis literature, <b>behavioral</b> psychology, and from randomized clinical trials, several evidenced based interventions have emerged: <b>behavioral</b> marital therapy, motivational Interviewing, community reinforcement approach, exposure therapy, contingency management They help suppress cravings and mental anxiety, improve focus on treatment and new learning <b>behavioral</b> skills, ease withdrawal symptoms {{and reduce the}} chances of relapse.|$|E
25|$|Acknowledging {{the effect}} of praise as a {{positive}} reinforcement strategy, numerous <b>behavioral</b> and cognitive <b>behavioral</b> interventions have incorporated the use of praise in their protocols. The strategic use of praise is recognized as an evidence-based practice in both classroom management and parenting training interventions, though praise is often subsumed in intervention research into a larger category of positive reinforcement, which includes strategies such as strategic attention and <b>behavioral</b> rewards.|$|E
25|$|<b>Behavioral</b> {{irritability}} and aggression: a 2012 observational {{analysis of}} subjects {{of an earlier}} study found a strong relation between dietary trans fat acids and self-reported <b>behavioral</b> aggression and irritability, suggesting but not establishing causality.|$|E
25|$|Richardson et al. {{provide the}} example of <b>behavioral</b> therapy and psychodynamic therapy. If a {{therapist}} wanted {{to understand how the}} world affects his clients, he might integrate <b>behavioral</b> therapy into his practice. But, once he wanted to understand the inner dynamics of the psyche, he would have to integrate psychodynamic therapy in with <b>behavioral</b> therapy. The problem is that psychodynamic therapy says human suffering is caused by the conflicts and turmoil within the inner psyche while <b>behavioral</b> therapy says that human suffering is caused by external stimuli, reinforcement, and other forms of conditioning. These two theories are in direct contradiction to each other.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{orientation}} change {{efforts are}} methods that aim {{to change a}} same-sex sexual orientation. They may include <b>behavioral</b> techniques, cognitive <b>behavioral</b> therapy, reparative therapy, psychoanalytic techniques, medical approaches, and religious and spiritual approaches.|$|E
25|$|The <b>behavioral</b> {{approach}} to workplace motivation {{is known as}} Organizational <b>Behavioral</b> Modification. This approach applies the tenets of behaviorism developed by B.F. Skinner to promote employee behaviors that an employer deems beneficial and discourage those that are not.|$|E
25|$|Buddhist texts {{also contain}} mental {{strategies}} of thought modification which {{are similar to}} Cognitive <b>behavioral</b> therapy techniques. A comparison of these systems of cognitive <b>behavioral</b> modification has been discussed by professor William Mikulas and Padmal de Silva.|$|E
25|$|<b>Behavioral</b> Economics Club, one of {{the first}} student {{organizations}} in a major university devoted entirely to the topic of <b>behavioral</b> economics. The group is composed of undergraduate students from a variety of disciplines such as economics, finance, psychology, actuarial mathematics, statistics, and marketing.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{can follow}} a {{physiological}} or <b>behavioral</b> definition. In the physiological sense, sleep {{is a state}} characterized by reversible unconsciousness, special brainwave patterns, sporadic eye movement, loss of muscle tone (possibly with some exceptions; see below regarding the sleep of birds and of aquatic mammals), and a compensatory increase following deprivation of the state. In the <b>behavioral</b> sense, sleep is characterized by minimal movement, non-responsiveness to external stimuli (i.e. increased sensory threshold), {{the adoption of a}} typical posture, and the occupation of a sheltered site, all of which is usually repeated on a 24-hour basis. The physiological definition applies well to birds and mammals, but in other animals (whose brain is not as complex), the <b>behavioral</b> definition is more often used. In very simple animals, <b>behavioral</b> definitions of sleep are the only ones possible, and even then the <b>behavioral</b> repertoire of the animal may not be extensive enough to allow distinction between sleep and wakefulness.|$|E
25|$|Music {{therapists}} {{may work}} with {{individuals who have}} behavioral-emotional disorders. To {{meet the needs of}} this population, music therapists have taken current psychological theories and used them as a basis for different types of music therapy. Different models include <b>behavioral</b> therapy, cognitive <b>behavioral</b> therapy, and psychodynamic therapy.|$|E
