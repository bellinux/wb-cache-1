5|$|Huggins {{remained}} {{confident in}} his team's ability to repeat as AL champions in 1928 season. Huggins supplemented his team <b>by</b> <b>acquiring</b> Bill Dickey from the minor leagues. He acquired Stan Coveleski, who {{was attempting to}} return to his peak years, but released him in August when the former star continued to struggle. The Yankees reached the 1928 World Series, winning their sixth pennant in eight years, and defeated the Cardinals 4 games to 0.

5|$|The {{first use}} of ironclads in action came in the U.S. Civil War. The U.S. Navy {{at the time the}} war broke out had no ironclads, its most {{powerful}} ships being six unarmored steam-powered frigates. Since the bulk of the Navy remained loyal to the Union, the Confederacy sought to gain advantage in the naval conflict <b>by</b> <b>acquiring</b> modern armored ships. In May 1861, the Confederate Congress appropriated $2 million for the purchase of ironclads from overseas, and in July and August 1861 the Confederacy started work on construction and converting wooden ships.|$|E

5|$|After the Predators' {{regular season}} success in 2005–06, the team bolstered their lineup <b>by</b> <b>acquiring</b> centre Jason Arnott and winger Jean-Pierre Dumont. In {{response}} to Arnott's signing, Kariya {{commented that the}} centre position, as well as size, were weaknesses for the team the previous year, especially when they matched up against the Sharks' top two centres, Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau, in the playoffs. Leading up to the 2006–07 season, the Predators were picked by many analysts in the media (including those from The Globe and Mail and ESPN) to contend for the Stanley Cup. Prior {{to the start of}} the campaign, the Predators announced defenceman Kimmo Timonen as the team's new captain, while naming Kariya and Steve Sullivan as alternates (the two served in that role the previous season, as well, but not on a permanent basis). With Kariya leading the team in scoring, the team boasted the top record in the league by the All-Star break. At the NHL trade deadline, the team further bolstered their lineup <b>by</b> <b>acquiring</b> high-profile centre Peter Forsberg from Philadelphia. Forsberg joined Kariya on the top line, though not consistently. With 76 points (24 goals and 52 assists)—the second highest total in team history—over 82 games, Kariya led the Predators in scoring for a second-straight year. His seven shootout goals (over 11 attempts) tied for second in the league, one behind Erik Christensen of the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Predators continued to improve and finished with a new team record of 51 wins and 110 points. Despite ranking as the second-best team in the West, Nashville seeded fourth in their conference (divisional winners within the conference take the top three seeds; Detroit beat the Predators by three points in the Central Division). Playing against the San Jose Sharks for the second consecutive year, the Predators were once again eliminated in five games. Kariya struggled with two assists during the series.|$|E
5|$|After {{the player}} completes {{the game with}} either the bad ending or the best ending, Julius Mode is unlocked, similar to the Julius Mode in Aria of Sorrow. Julius Mode, in storyline terms, follows the {{assumption}} that Soma succumbed to his dark power, and became the new dark lord. A new game can then be started {{from the main menu}} in Julius Mode. In Julius Mode, the playable characters include Julius Belmont, Yoko Belnades, and Alucard. Each character has a weapon and an assortment of abilities unique to them, and although these abilities remain static throughout the entire game, the characters' statistics can improve <b>by</b> <b>acquiring</b> enough experience points to level up. The castle layout and enemies are the same, {{with the exception of the}} final battle, which is against Soma.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Origins {{introduces}} a multiplayer component to the series. Invisible Predator Online revolves around a gang war in Blackgate Prison between supervillains Joker and Bane. Three Joker gang members fight three Bane gang members, {{and in turn}} the team of Batman and Robin. Gangs win by killing all the opposing team's reinforcements, while Batman and Robin win <b>by</b> <b>acquiring</b> intimidation points (from eliminating gang members). A gang member can become boss (Joker or Bane), gaining more-powerful abilities. Gang members can access guns and explosives; Batman and Robin can access gadgets and abilities from the main game, including Detective Vision. Gang members have a limited Enhanced Vision, which requires recharging. Hunter, Hunted sets three Joker thugs and three Bane thugs against Batman in a last-team-standing match in which each character has one life.|$|E

5|$|By 2003, Juniper had diversified {{into three}} major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic. Juniper's first major {{diversification}} from core routers {{was when it}} entered the market for edge routers, <b>by</b> <b>acquiring</b> the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000. By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core. Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market. In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband. The product family was discontinued later that year.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, however, Sinclair Radionics was {{experiencing}} serious difficulties. It lost {{its ability to}} compete effectively in the calculator market following the launch {{of a new generation}} of Japanese-produced calculators with liquid crystal displays, which were much more capable and power-efficient than Sinclair's LED calculators. Projects to develop a pocket television and digital watch turned out to be expensive failures. The company made losses of more than £350,000 in 1975–76, bringing it to the edge of bankruptcy. In July 1977 Radionics was rescued by a state agency, the National Enterprise Board (NEB), which recapitalised it, provided a loan facility and took effective control of the company <b>by</b> <b>acquiring</b> a 73% stake.|$|E
5|$|In Quincy Newspapers' {{acquisition}} of Granite Broadcasting's remaining stations, the acquisition was briefly re-structured to have Malara Broadcast Group—which {{served as a}} virtual duopoly partner for Granite with WISE-TV (NBC) Fort Wayne and KDLH-TV Duluth (CBS), retain the stations and their current agreements with WPTA and KBJR-TV in lieu of having them sold to SagamoreHill Broadcasting. The acquisition was restructured in July 2015 to, again, have SagamoreHill Broadcasting acquire the two stations, but have their current SSAs wound down within nine months. Following {{the end of the}} SSA, the two stations retained The CW as independently-run stations, with their remaining affiliations moved to subchannels of KBJR and WPTA. Quincy similarly wound down an SSA in Peoria, Illinois with Sinclair-owned WHOI <b>by</b> <b>acquiring</b> rights to its ABC and CW programming, and moving them to subchannels of WEEK-TV, in exchange for giving up its Fox affiliation for WSJV-TV in South Bend to Sinclair's WSBT-TV.|$|E

5|$|On 24 July 1930 Palmer's {{launched}} its thousandth ship, the tanker Peter Hurll, but {{by this time}} the brief shipbuilding boom had been ended by the Great Depression, and there were no new orders on the firm's books. Rumours of impending reorganisation and rationalisation in the industry gave the workforce cause for anxiety, which deepened with the formation in 1930 of National Shipbuilders Security Ltd (NSS). This was a company created by the government to assist shipbuilders <b>by</b> <b>acquiring</b> failing yards and dismantling them, so that production was concentrated within a smaller number of profitable yards. To ensure this rationalisation was sustained, the closed yards were banned from any shipbuilding activity for at least 40 years.|$|E
5|$|Some {{more modern}} steels include tool steels, which are alloyed with {{large amounts of}} {{tungsten}} and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution hardening. This also allows the use of precipitation hardening and improves the alloy's temperature resistance. Tool steel is generally used in axes, drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other special-purpose alloys include weathering steels such as Cor-ten, which weather <b>by</b> <b>acquiring</b> a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted. Maraging steel is alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel contains little carbon (0.01%). This creates a very strong but still malleable steel.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} consecration, John bought Bath Abbey's grounds from the king, {{as well as}} the city of Bath itself. Whether John paid Rufus for the town or whether he was given the town as a gift by the king is unclear. The abbey had {{recently}} lost its abbot Alfsige, and was according to Domesday Book the owner of large estates in and near the town. It would have been the wealth of the abbey that attracted John to take over the monastery. <b>By</b> <b>acquiring</b> the town of Bath, John also acquired the mint that was in the town. In 1090 he transferred the seat, or administration, of the bishopric to Bath Abbey, probably as an attempt to increase the revenues of his see. Bath was a rich abbey, and Wells had always been a poor diocese. By taking over the abbey, John increased his episcopal revenues. William of Malmesbury portrays the moving of the episcopal seat as motivated by a desire for the lands of the abbey, but {{it was part of a}} pattern at the time of moving cathedral seats from small villages to larger towns. When John moved his episcopal seat, he also took over the abbey of Bath as his cathedral chapter, turning his diocese into a bishopric served by monks instead of the canons located at Wells that had previously served the diocese.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyena {{societies}} {{are more complex}} than those of other carnivorous mammals, and are remarkably {{similar to those of}} cercopithecine primates in respect to group size, structure, competition and cooperation. Like cercopithecine primates, spotted hyenas use multiple sensory modalities, recognise individual conspecifics, are conscious that some clan-mates may be more reliable than others, recognise third-party kin and rank relationships among clan-mates, and adaptively use this knowledge during social decision making. Also, like cercopithecine primates, dominance ranks in hyena {{societies are}} not correlated with size or aggression, but with ally networks. In this latter trait, the spotted hyena further show parallels with primates <b>by</b> <b>acquiring</b> rank through coalition. However, rank reversals and overthrows in spotted hyena clans are very rare. The social network dynamics of spotted hyenas are determined by multiple factors. Environmental factors include rainfall and prey abundance; individual factors include preference to bond with females and with kin; and topological effects include the tendency to close triads in the network. Female hyenas are more flexible than males in their social bonding preferences.|$|E
5|$|Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing) led a coup against Emperor Xizong {{and became}} fourth emperor of the Jin dynasty in 1150. Wanyan Liang {{presented}} {{himself as a}} Chinese emperor, and planned to unite China by conquering the Song. In 1158, Wanyan Liang provided a casus belli by announcing that the Song had broken the 1142 peace treaty <b>by</b> <b>acquiring</b> horses. He instituted an unpopular draft that {{was the source of}} widespread unrest in the empire. Anti-Jin revolts erupted among the Khitans and in Jin provinces bordering the Song. Wanyan Liang did not allow dissent, and opposition to the war was severely punished. The Song had been notified beforehand of Wanyan Liang's plan. They prepared by securing their defenses along the border, mainly near the Yangtze River, but were hampered by Emperor Gaozong's indecisiveness. Gaozong's desire for peace made him averse to provoking the Jin. Wanyan Liang began the invasion in 1161 without formally declaring war. Jurchen armies personally led by Wanyan Liang left Kaifeng on October 15, reached the Huai River border on October 28, and marched {{in the direction of the}} Yangtze. The Song lost the Huai to the Jurchens but captured a few Jin prefectures in the west, slowing the Jurchen advance. A group of Jurchen generals were sent to cross the Yangtze near the city of Caishi (south of Ma'anshan in modern Anhui) while Wanyan Liang established a base near Yangzhou.|$|E
