5|$|As {{one of his}} favourites, Hazlitt places Cymbeline {{first in}} his discussions of Shakespeare's plays, {{according}} it extensive treatment. This includes his personal impressions of individual characters—as the book's title would lead us to expect—but also the kind of broader consideration for which he would not <b>be</b> <b>credited</b> {{for at least a}} century and a half.|$|E

5|$|Articles {{published}} in the 1970s and later suggest that Debierne's results {{published in}} 1904 conflict with those reported in 1899 and 1900. Furthermore, the now-known chemistry of actinium precludes its presence {{as anything other than}} a minor constituent of Debierne's 1899 and 1900 results; in fact, the chemical properties he reported make it likely that he had, instead, accidentally identified protactinium, which would not be discovered for another fourteen years, only to have it disappear due to its hydrolysis and adsorption onto his laboratory equipment. This has led some authors to advocate that Giesel alone should <b>be</b> <b>credited</b> with the discovery. A less confrontational vision of scientific discovery is proposed by Adloff. He suggests that hindsight criticism of the early publications should be mitigated by the then nascent state of radiochemistry: highlighting the prudence of Debierne's claims in the original papers, he notes that nobody can contend that Debierne's substance did not contain actinium. Debierne, who is now considered by the vast majority of historians as the discoverer, lost interest in the element and left the topic. Giesel, on the other hand, can rightfully <b>be</b> <b>credited</b> with the first preparation of radiochemically pure actinium and with the identification of its atomic number 89.|$|E
5|$|Billy Smith of the New York Islanders, in the 1979–80 season, was {{the first}} goaltender to <b>be</b> <b>credited</b> with a goal in the NHL when Rob Ramage of the Colorado Rockies put the puck into his own empty net.

5|$|In 1999, Carter began {{adapting}} {{the comic book}} series Harsh Realm as a television show, also titled Harsh Realm. Carter's friend and frequent collaborator Daniel Sackheim had optioned the comics for adaptation in 1996. However, when the series first aired on October 8, 1999, the comics' writers Andrew Paquette and James Hudnall were given no writing credits for the work; the two then filed suit against Fox to <b>be</b> <b>credited</b> for their work. Harsh Realm received disappointing viewing figures, and was cancelled after only three episodes had been broadcast.|$|E
5|$|In May 1947 {{the artistic}} {{collaboration}} between Hergé and Jacobs ended after an argument.

5|$|Melvil Dewey (1851–1931) was an American {{librarian}} and self-declared reformer. He was {{a founding}} member of the American Library Association and can <b>be</b> <b>credited</b> with the promotion of card systems in libraries and business. He developed the ideas for his library classification system in 1873 while working at Amherst College library. He applied the classification to the books in that library, until in 1876 he had a first version of the classification. In 1876, he published the classification in pamphlet form with the title A Classification and Subject Index for Cataloguing and Arranging the Books and Pamphlets of a Library.|$|E

5|$|Murphy {{developed}} his eponymous anastomotic button for a sutureless anastomosis of the gallbladder to the duodenum (his preferred treatment for acute cholecystitis), {{but it was}} equally suitable for intestinal anastomoses. He developed it in the experimental animal laboratory in a barn behind his house and first used it {{less than a week}} after developing it on a dog. The Murphy button can <b>be</b> <b>credited</b> as the forerunner of the modern end-to-end stapling instrument after having become the method of choice for operations at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere in the United States for over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|The Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested was {{instructed}} by Frederick III {{to negotiate with}} the Swedes, and the resulting peace treaty can largely <b>be</b> <b>credited</b> to him. Without any direct involvement by foreign powers, the Danes and Swedes managed to negotiate the Treaty of Copenhagen within weeks, much to the surprise of both parties. A bone of contention was the islands of Hven and Bornholm, the latter having received the Danish king's personal promise of protection. In the end, Bornholm remained under Danish control in exchange for a number of estates in the south of present-day Sweden.|$|E
