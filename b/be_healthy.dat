Just one game into his second-round match against Tommy Robredo, Raonic called for a medical timeout due to a right foot injury. Although {{he went on to}} win the match, Raonic's manager {{indicated}} that Raonic had made a pre-existing injury worse by playing. In his quarterfinal match against Berdych, he complained of numbness in his right foot during a medical timeout, and retired while trailing 2–5 in the opening set. It was diagnosed as a pinched nerve, and Raonic was expected to <b>be</b> <b>healthy</b> for the Madrid Open.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the club}} has had notable defeats from 2000–01 onwards, crowds have {{continued}} to <b>be</b> <b>healthy.</b> During the 2005–06 season, home attendances (that is, given attendances minus away support) increased slightly on the season before, helped by a 10,006 crowd against Carlisle {{on the final day}} of the season. That game in particular attracted a large crowd as the town of Stockport supported its team at Edgeley Park. If Stockport had lost that particular game, they would have been relegated for the second successive season, and more significantly, would have been relegated from the Football League for the first time, an embarrassment as the team has competed continuously in the Football League since 1900. Stockport eventually drew the game with Carlisle and survived the drop, while Carlisle themselves gained the league championship.|$|E

25|$|Peter Singer (Princeton University and University of Melbourne {{professor}} and pioneer {{of the animal}} liberation movement) has long argued that, if {{it is possible to}} survive and <b>be</b> <b>healthy</b> without eating meat, fish, dairy, or eggs, one ought to choose that option instead of causing unnecessary harm to animals. In Animal Liberation, Singer argued that, because non-human animals feel, they should be treated according to utilitarian ethics. Singer's work has since been widely built upon by philosophers, both those who agree and those who do not, and it has been applied by animal rights advocates as well as by ethical vegetarians and vegans.|$|E
25|$|The {{island has}} a long history of {{producing}} a variety of noted cuisines and wines, to the extent that Sicily is sometimes nicknamed God's Kitchen because of this. Every part of Sicily has its speciality (for example Cassata is typical of Palermo, even if available everywhere in Sicily, as is Granita, a Catania speciality). The ingredients are typically rich in taste while remaining affordable to the general public The savoury dishes of Sicily are viewed to <b>be</b> <b>healthy,</b> using fresh vegetables and fruits, such as tomatoes, artichokes, olives (including olive oil), citrus, apricots, aubergines, onions, beans, raisins commonly coupled with seafood, freshly caught from the surrounding coastlines, including tuna, sea bream, sea bass, cuttlefish, swordfish, sardines, and others.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 the Chinese {{government}} {{reacted to}} these complaints and incidents by prescribing {{a set of}} standardized routines for all dancers to follow, claiming they would be culturally unifying and healthier.

The real problem, yet others said, was not only the lack of better places for the dancing but the lack of other social opportunities for the women. The government soon clarified that the routines it created and promoted were only meant to <b>be</b> <b>healthy</b> alternatives to existing ones and were not required.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, {{under the}} new {{legislative}} framework of the Species At Risk Act , COSEWIC placed the Newfoundland and Labrador fisheries cod on {{the endangered species list}} and Fisheries Minister Robert Thibault announced an indefinite closure in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and off Newfoundland's northeast coast. In a 2004 report, the WWF agreed the Barents Sea cod fishery appeared to <b>be</b> <b>healthy,</b> but that the situation may not last due to illegal fishing, industrial development, and high quotas. In 2005, the WWF—Canada accused both foreign and Canadian fishing vessels of deliberate, large-scale violations of the restrictions on the Grand Banks, in the form of bycatch. WWF also claimed poor enforcement by NAFO, an intergovernmental organization with a mandate to provide scientific fishery advice and management in the northwestern Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|Salmon is {{a popular}} food. Classified as an oily fish, salmon is {{considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>healthy</b> due to the fish's high protein, high omega-3 fatty acids, and high vitamin D content. Salmon is also a source of cholesterol, {{with a range of}} 23–214mg/100g depending on the species. According to reports in the journal Science, farmed salmon may contain high levels of dioxins. PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) levels may be up to eight times higher in farmed salmon than in wild salmon, but still well below levels considered dangerous. Nonetheless, according to a 2006 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the benefits of eating even farmed salmon still outweigh any risks imposed by contaminants. Farmed salmon has a high omega 3 fatty acid content comparable to wild salmon. The type of omega-3 present may not be a factor for other important health functions.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, cod {{was placed}} on the list of {{endangered}} species by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), an international non-governmental organization for the conservation, research and restoration of the natural environment, formerly named the World Wildlife Fund. The WWF issued a report stating that global cod catch had suffered a 70 per cent drop over the last 30 years, and that if this trend continued, the world's cod stocks would disappear in 15 years. The endangered species claim by the WWF was disputed by Åsmund Bjordal, director of the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research, who stated that in view of the health of the Barents Sea cod population, cod should not be placed on an endangered species list. Cod is among Norway's most important fishery export items, and the Barents Sea is the most important cod fishery of Norway. In a 2004 report, the WWF agreed that the Barents Sea cod fishery appeared to <b>be</b> <b>healthy</b> but that that may not last due to illegal fishing, industrial development, and high fishing quota.|$|E

25|$|The opening half of {{the first}} period {{featured}} tentative play by both teams but with Pittsburgh outperforming Detroit offensively in the frame. However, the Red Wings got the best scoring chance, as Kirk Maltby gained possession of a bouncing puck after a faceoff in the Penguins' zone. Maltby's shot was then stopped by the glove of goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury from point blank range. At 1:13 in the second period, Pittsburgh struck first, as Max Talbot scored following a turnover. The goal resulted after Brad Stuart attempted to clear the zone following a dump-in by Brooks Orpik into Detroit territory. Evgeni Malkin used his skates to block Stuart's pass, and the puck {{found its way to}} Talbot, who patiently waited to find a shooting lane behind goaltender Chris Osgood. Both teams gained chances through the middle of the period, with each goalie coming up strong. On one sequence, Brian Rafalski made a quick pass to Darren Helm in the left circle, where he was stopped by Fleury. As Rafalski set up for a rebound shot, he lost the puck to Pittsburgh's Matt Cooke, who was then stuffed on a breakaway attempt. Soon afterward, Penguins captain Sidney Crosby was crunched into the boards by Johan Franzen and sustained a knee injury. He would <b>be</b> <b>healthy</b> enough to play only one shift {{for the remainder of the}} game.|$|E
25|$|The {{food from}} Uttrakhand {{is known to}} <b>be</b> <b>healthy</b> and {{wholesome}} to suit the high-energy necessities of the cold, mountainous region. It is a high protein diet that makes heavy use of pulses and vegetables. Traditionally it is cooked over wood or charcoal fire mostly in iron utensils. While also making use of condiments such as jeera, haldi and rai common in other Indian cuisines, Uttarakhand cuisine uses some exotic condiments like jambu, timmer, ghandhraini and bhangira. Similarly, although the people in Uttarakhand also prepare the dishes common {{in other parts of}} northern India, several preparations are unique to Uttarakhand tradition such as rus, chudkani, dubuk, chadanji, jholi, kapa, etc. Among dressed salads and sauces, kheere ka raita, nimbu mooli ka raita, daarim ki khatai and aam ka fajitha necessarily deserve a mention. The cuisine mainly consists of food from two different sub regions—Garhwal and Kumaon—though their basic ingredients are the same. Both the Kumaoni and Garhwali styles make liberal use of ghee, lentils or pulses, vegetables and bhaat (rice). They also use Badi (sun-dried Urad Dal balls) and Mungodi (sun-dried Moong Dal balls) as substitutes for vegetables at times. During festivals and other celebrations, the people of Uttarakhand prepare special refreshments which include both salty preparations such as bada and sweet preparations such as pua and singal. Uttarakhand also has several sweets (mithai) such as singodi, bal-mithai, malai laddu, etc. native to its tradition.|$|E
