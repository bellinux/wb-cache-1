This {{position is}} used for jumping and galloping, as {{it is easy to}} stay out of the horse's way and gives the horse the most freedom to use its body. However, the position also provides the least amount of control, and so is only used when the horse's behavior and body is focused properly. This position requires a rider to have good <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>leg</b> strength to perform well for long periods, and it can be quite tiring.

40|$|Lardoglyphus zacheri Oudemans and L. (= H oshikadania) konoi (Sasa and Asanuma) {{were sent}} to me by Mr. D. A. Griffiths of the Infestation Control Division of the Ministry of Agriculture. They were found in butcher's offal ("gut greaves"), used in the {{manufacture}} of fertiliser, on premises near Chesterfield. In this particular case the offal was obtained locally, though it can also be imported from the Argentine; possibly the mites were orginally introduced into this country on empty uncleaned sacks obtained from other manufacturers. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a more complete description of L. zacheri Oudemans, and also to clear up some confusion in nomenclature. Lardoglyphus zacheri Oudemans, 1927 (figs. 1 - 5) Female (fig. 1). Length of idiosoma of six individuals: 450 - 600 /JI. The body is spindle-shaped, widest between the second and third pairs of legs and tapering towards either end; the posterior edge is concave. The body cuticle is smooth and cream-coloured, the legs, apodemes, and chelicerae are of a darker shade; the propodosoma lacks a dorsal shield and is clearly separated by a transverse groove from the hysterosoma. The setae of the idiosoma are smooth and slightly pectinate. The vertical internals (v. i) arise close together and project forward over the gnathosoma without reaching its extremity; the vertical externals (v. e) orginate from the same level, they are pectinate and curve towards the base of the chelicerae; behind them are the pseudostigmatic organs — small, curved and serrated — which lie in a depression above the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>leg</b> I and are encircled by a lateral sclerite; at the anterior end of this sclerite is Grandjeans organ, a triangular fold of cuticle...|$|E
5000|$|Key {{characteristics}} of Polyphaga {{are that the}} hind coxa (<b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leg),</b> does not divide {{the first and second}} abdominal/ventral plates which are known as sternites. Also, the notopleural suture (found under the pronotal shield) is not present.|$|R
50|$|The Meinertellidae are a {{small family}} of basal insects {{belonging}} to the order Archaeognatha. They are sometimes known as rock bristletails.

50|$|The family Peltoperlidae {{comprises}} 11 genera and 46 known species. Species are semivoltine, meaning their lifecycles last 1 to 2 years. Adults of {{the family}} usually emerge in late spring or early summer, April through June. Larvae are flattened and brown in color, and they are roach-like in appearance because of the expanded thoracic plates covering the <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> their <b>legs,</b> heads, and abdomens. Tapering gills occur on the thorax at the <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the <b>legs.</b> These tracheal gills are multifunctional and key to many biological processes. No dense tufts or branching gills are found on their thoraces or abdomens, unlike other Plecoptera families. The larvae also possess broad, chisel-like mandibles. Adults have two ocelli {{in addition to its}} two compound eyes. Male epiprocts are sclerotized and rod-like in shape, and both genders lack cross-veins in the anal lobe of the forewings.|$|R
50|$|The front {{segment of}} the thorax (prothorax) carries a pair <b>of</b> <b>legs,</b> and the synthorax carries the middle and rear legs and both pairs of wings. A dark stripe (humeral stripe) often follows the humeral suture, which runs from the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the front wing towards the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the middle <b>leg.</b> A paler antehumeral stripe is often found above the humeral stripe.|$|R
25|$|Clerid beetles {{fall under}} the {{suborder}} Polyphaga. Key characteristics of Polyphaga are that the hind coxa (<b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leg),</b> do not divide {{the first and second}} abdominal/ventral plates which are known as sternites. Also, the notopleural suture (found under the pronotal shield) is not present. To further identify Clerid beetles, a few additional characteristics need to be examined.|$|R
50|$|The black {{salamander}} {{can grow}} to 60 to 75 mm long.

50|$|To perform declawing, {{the claws}} are snapped {{downward}} {{away from the}} crab. To ensure a clean break along the natural fracture plane, one finger {{is placed on the}} basal cheliped joint. With the cheliped fully extended, a quick, firm downward motion normally removes the claw cleanly. The break usually occurs at the basi-ischum between the coxa at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leg</b> and the merus.|$|R
25|$|The {{feeding method}} of tadpole shrimps {{is similar to}} that {{proposed}} for the ancestral crustacean. The anterior appendages (second pair to tenth pair) stir sediments and swirl muddy water into the wide, midventral food groove. The gnathobases (inward-facing lobes at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leg)</b> guide food anteriorly to the mouth. The large flat exopods (outward-facing lobes at the end <b>of</b> the <b>leg)</b> stir and lift the sediments. Fine silt particles and water escape easily, but large, coarse food particles are torn into smaller pieces by the blade-like, inward-facing lobes called endopods at the end <b>of</b> the <b>leg.</b>|$|R
25|$|Clerid beetles have unique {{legs that}} help to {{distinguish}} them from other families. Their tarsal formula is 5–5–5, meaning that {{on each of the}} front, middle and hind legs there are 5 tarsomeres (individual subsegments of the feet/tarsi). One or more of these subsegments on each leg is typically lobed, and the 4th tarsi is normally difficult to distinguish. Furthermore, an important feature that eliminates many other families of beetles is that clerids' front coxae (<b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leg)</b> expose the second segment <b>of</b> the <b>legs</b> known as the trochanter.|$|R

50|$|The {{number of}} {{segments}} constituting the thorax varies from 10 to 32, {{and the number}} <b>of</b> <b>legs</b> varies accordingly. They are similar in structure to the <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> tadpole shrimp, and similarly, their size decreases from front to back. In females, the outer lobes <b>of</b> several middle <b>legs</b> are modified into long, upward-bending threadlike outgrowths, used to hold the eggs on the dorsal {{side of the body}} under the shell. However, the main functions <b>of</b> the thoracic <b>legs</b> are respiration and carrying food forward to the mouth. The gills are basically the outer lobes <b>of</b> all thoracic <b>legs</b> that are closest to the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leg.</b> The legs are in constant movement, and the water between the valves of the carapace is quickly renewed. The body ends in a large chitinised telson, which is either laterally compressed and bears a pair of large hooks, or dorsoventrally compressed, with short hooks.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} {{expedition}} in New Guinea (1920), Mr. van Heurn, a zealous naturalist, at {{a height of}} 2900 m. (Doormanpad) in cavities of Hydnophytum found some specimens of Peripatus, which were conspicuously colored. There are six ♀ and one ♂. The living animal has a pale blue colour and on its dorsum is provided with a double row of irregular, quadrangular spots of a violet red coloration. In one specimen also at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>legs</b> a row <b>of</b> such spots is visible. Like as in Paraperipatus lorentzi 1) there is a ventral median line of longitudinal whitish spots; these spots, situated between each pair <b>of</b> <b>legs,</b> are usually divided into a smaller, roundish anterior one and a posterior one, which is somewhat sagittate. Over {{the middle of the}} dorsum there runs a fine, whitish line; the pads <b>of</b> the <b>legs</b> are ochraceous. The primary papillae have their basal part yellowish colored, whereas the tip is darker; only those lying within the circumference of the dorsal spots are yellowish over their whole surface. One specimen, 60 mm. long, found at the height of 1400 m. in rotten wood, during life was very dark violet, except the white spots in the median ventral line; the legs were somewhat paler and the underside of the feet dark ochraceous. The male specimen, measuring 24 mm. in length, is dark brown with a double row of indistinct, red spots in the median dorsal area, whereas laterally near the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> each <b>leg</b> there occur a couple of punctiform white spots; its ventral side has a marbled appearance by the presence of whitish, primary papillae. This ♂ specimen has 22 pairs of legs; however the last pair is somewhat rudimentary for it lacks the foot and only its basal part is present.

5|$|Harvestmen {{are among}} the {{minority}} of living chelicerates that can take solid food, and the group includes predators, herbivores and scavengers. Horseshoe crabs are also capable of processing solid food, and use a distinctive feeding system. Claws at the tips <b>of</b> their <b>legs</b> grab small invertebrates and pass them to a food groove that runs from between the rearmost legs to the mouth, {{which is on the}} underside of the head and faces slightly backwards. The <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> the <b>legs</b> form toothed gnathobases that both grind the food and push it towards the mouth. This is how the earliest arthropods are thought to have fed.|$|R
50|$|Female An. sinensis has a dark-coloured body, {{with its}} palps are shorter than proboscis. The {{integument}} {{of the neck}} region is yellow. The legs are dark-brown on outer surface, but pale on the inside. The <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leg</b> is swollen towards the body. The wings are covered with dark and pale scales. The tip of the wing has a prominent spot. Larva has an elongated head. Its antennae are {{about the length of}} the head, and containing pointed spicules towards the inner side.|$|R
50|$|Uca crassipes {{usually have}} a crimson red {{carapace}} although some individuals may have black margins or patches. The large male cheliped is reddish pink.

25|$|Rhacophoridae flying frogs (gliding). A {{number of}} the Rhacophoridae, such as Wallace's flying frog (Rhacophorus nigropalmatus), have adaptations for gliding, the main feature being {{enlarged}} toe membranes. For example, the Malayan flying frog Rhacophorus prominanus glides using the membranes between the toes of its limbs, and small membranes located at the heel, the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leg,</b> and the forearm. Some of the frogs are quite accomplished gliders, for example, the Chinese flying frog Rhacophorus dennysi can maneuver in the air, making two kinds of turn, either rolling into the turn (a banked turn) or yawing into the turn (a crabbed turn).|$|R
