5|$|To a {{significant}} extent, the royal administration had achieved territorial stability by <b>battening</b> onto minsters. Well might late tenth-century polemicists blame kings of Wessex and their magnates, {{even more than}} the Vikings, for despoiling the Church's resources. The scars of the Viking raids had healed, but the secularization of minsters continued on its slow, consistent course.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Arthur's arrival, Nova Scotia Power prepared and collected resources {{in case of}} power outages and other impacts in the region. Numerous weekend events were called off throughout the Canadian Maritimes, including the Stan Rogers Folk Festival. Multiple boat-owners and fisherman took extra precautions by <b>battening</b> down hatches and tying extra lines to wharves to keep ships and boats from coming loose in the storm. Environment Canada officials issued high wind warnings in addition to earlier tropical storm warnings for the Maritimes and considered imposing rainfall warnings for western portions of Prince Edward Island as well. Province-managed parks in Nova Scotia, including beaches and camping grounds, were shut down prior to Arthur's arrival, and several airlines waived transfer fees. Officials in Moncton stated that city personnel {{would be prepared to}} respond to potential issues caused by Arthur, such as flooding or fallen trees, while the Canadian Red Cross readied volunteers in case of the need for emergency assistance. The Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station took precautionary measures against the storm, with Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission employees deployed to the site.|$|E
2500|$|Ohios {{first few}} months of service proved eventful. The winter [...] of 1873-74 was {{particularly}} bad on the Atlantic, and on a late winter voyage to Liverpool, Ohio lost two lifeboats, while her after wheelhouse was damaged beyond repair by the waves. During a March crossing to Philadelphia, the ship was so battered by heavy seas that she suffered damage to her bow. In May, some of Ohios cargo caught fire between Liverpool and Queenstown. After the fire was extinguished, the ship resumed her voyage to Liverpool, but the cargo caught fire a second time, and was only finally extinguished by a combination of <b>battening</b> the hatches to starve the flames of oxygen and the use of steam pumps. In February of the same year, the wooden bridge of Ohios sister ship Pennsylvania was torn from the vessel in a hurricane, and a new iron bridge was subsequently installed on all four of the Pennsylvania class vessels.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first was}} the work of Origen Bacheler, who had no direct contact with the body of Mormons, and {{contained}} the contents of a debate between the author and Parley Pratt, with Pratt's side omitted. Bushman describes the author's rhetoric as indistinguishable from that uttered by [...] "scores of other polemicists of his time," [...] providing a glimpse into the kind of material considered anti-Mormon. The pamphlet described Joseph Smith as a [...] "blockhead," [...] a [...] "juggling, money-digging, fortune-telling impostor" [...] and, along with the Book of Mormon witnesses, as [...] "perhaps the most infamous liars and impostors that ever breathed. ... By their deception and lies, they swindle them out of their property, disturb social order and the public peace, excite a spirit of ferocity and murder, and lead multitudes astray on the subject in which, of all others, they have the deepest interest."

[...] He described the Book of Mormon as, [...] "the most gross, the most ridiculous, the most imbecile, the most contemptible concern, that was ever attempted to be palmed off upon society as a revelation." [...] He believed the religion [...] "can be viewed in no other light than that of monstrous public nuisances, that ought forthwith to be abated" [...] and that the Mormons were [...] "the most vile, the most impudent, the most impious, knot of charlatans and cheat with which any community was ever disgraced and cursed." [...] Antidote to Mormonism describes Mormons as [...] "miserable enemies of both God and man—engines of death and hell."

50|$|Junk rigs feature {{full-length}} <b>battens</b> {{that facilitate}} short-handed sail handling, including reefing. The <b>battens</b> are attached loosely to the mast with lines called <b>batten</b> parrels that allow fore-and-aft motion as the sail {{is controlled by}} individual sheets leading to multiple <b>battens.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} <b>batten,</b> a.k.a. lighting <b>batten,</b> {{may be a}} single-pipe or truss <b>batten.</b> Electric <b>battens</b> typically incorporate steel straps {{that are}} used as brackets {{for the support of}} electrical equipment such as connector strips (raceways). The same straps supporting electrical equipment may also connect the two-pipe arrangement of a truss <b>batten.</b> The center-to-center spacing of electric truss pipe, often from 1.5 to 2.5 ft, is typically greater than for a standard truss <b>batten</b> to allow for the proper mounting and focusing of lighting instruments. It is typical for an electric <b>batten</b> to support thousands of pounds of live load.|$|R

50|$|A sail <b>batten</b> is a {{flexible}} insert in a fore-and-aft sail that provides added stiffness and definition to the sail's airfoil cross-section. The most common use of sail <b>battens</b> {{is in the}} roach of a mainsail. The <b>batten</b> extends the leech past the line that runs from the head and the clew of the sail to create a wider sail towards the top. Cruising sailboats may have four to six <b>battens.</b> Racing sailboats may have full-length <b>battens,</b> as well, that allow for better sail shape. <b>Battens</b> are also found in jibs of beach-cat catamarans. Most <b>battens</b> are fiberglass pultrusions with a thin, rectangular cross section.|$|R
50|$|Truss <b>battens,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as double <b>battens,</b> use a pipe-over-pipe arrangement (often 12 in center-to-center), with vertical struts welded between the upper and lower pipes to provide rigidity. Truss <b>battens</b> generally permit greater loads than single-pipe <b>battens</b> and may not require as many lift lines due to improved ability to span between lift lines. Truss <b>battens</b> are typically designed to support 25 to 50 lb of live load per foot.|$|R
50|$|To augment {{his income}} while at Westminster Abbey, <b>Batten</b> {{worked as a}} music copyist, and the Abbey's account books record {{payments}} to <b>Batten</b> for copying works of Weelkes, Tallis and Tomkins. <b>Batten</b> is credited with the preservation of many pieces of church music of the time, compiled in the <b>Batten</b> Organbook (now in possession of St. Michael's College, Tenbury), a 498-page quarto in his handwriting. Containing many popular works of that time, which <b>Batten</b> scored for the organ, the <b>Batten</b> Organbook is the only surviving source for many pieces of the time.|$|R

At least, so we judged from the motion, for we could not see either it or the sky; everything was as black as pitch. We heard the sailors, however, engaged in rigging guide ropes fore and aft, and <b>battening</b> down the hatches with extra tarpaulins by the light of lanterns. Also they were putting ropes round the boats and doing something to the spars and topmasts.|$|E
