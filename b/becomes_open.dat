The highway takes on the name Sharp Street from this intersection as it heads west within Cooma urban area. Upon leaving Cooma, the road heads west via farmland {{to the village of}} [...] Here the road meets a T-intersection, with through traffic taking Kosciuszko Road southwest towards [...] The highway turns to continue on its westerly heading. The roadway then makes its way through undulating terrain for some distance before it passes through , and on into Kosciuszko National Park. The road winds through mountainous terrain as it climbs towards the abandoned mining settlement of , situated at an altitude of around [...] The landscape <b>becomes</b> <b>open</b> grassland at this point and remains relatively flat as the road continues relatively gently up an alpine valley created by the Eucumbene River and its numerous tributaries. At the top of the valley the road reaches its highest point a little below [...] The road then descends into part of a similar valley created by the Murrumbidgee River as it passes by the access roads for Yarrangobilly Caves. The highway then veers northwest back into forested terrain and continues along the same rough heading through hilly terrain for some distance before a mountainous descent from , near the town of [...] which is located a few kilometres west of the highway. Continuing on, the roadway passes by Jounama Dam and then roughly parallels the eastern side of Blowering Reservoir (created by Blowering Dam further downstream). It then leaves the National Park descending into farmland on the Tumut Plains, roughly [...] above sea level.|$|E

2500|$|The rare Santa Lucia fir (Abies bracteata) {{is found}} only in the Santa Lucia mountains. [...] A common [...] "foreign" [...] species is the Monterey pine (Pinus radiata), which was {{uncommon}} in Big Sur until the late nineteenth century, though its major native habitat {{is only a few}} miles upwind on the Monterey Peninsula, when many homeowners began to plant the quick-growing tree as a windbreak. There are many broadleaved trees as well, such as the tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), and California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica). [...] In the rain shadow, the forests disappear and the vegetation <b>becomes</b> <b>open</b> oak woodland, then transitions into the more familiar fire-tolerant California chaparral scrub.|$|E
2500|$|Checkers {{placed on}} the bar must {{re-enter}} the game through the opponent's home board before any other move can be made. A roll of 1 allows the checker to enter on the 24-point (opponent's 1), a roll of 2 on the 23-point (opponent's 2), and so forth, up to a roll of 6 allowing entry on the 19-point (opponent's 6). Checkers may not enter on a point occupied by two or more opposing checkers. Checkers can enter on unoccupied points, or on points occupied by a single opposing checker; in the latter case, the single checker is hit and {{placed on the}} bar. More than one checker {{can be on the}} bar at a time. A player may not move any other checkers until all checkers on the bar belonging to that player have re-entered the board. If a player has checkers on the bar, but rolls a combination that does not allow any of those checkers to re-enter, the player does not move. If the opponent's home board is completely [...] "closed" [...] (i.e. all six points are each occupied by two or more checkers), there is no roll that will allow a player to enter a checker from the bar, and that player stops rolling and playing until at least one point <b>becomes</b> <b>open</b> (occupied by one or zero checkers) due to the opponent's moves.|$|E

60|$|Though {{society is}} not founded on a contract, and though no good purpose is {{answered}} by inventing a contract in order to deduce social obligations from it, every one who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit, {{and the fact of}} living in society renders it indispensable that each should be bound to observe a certain line of conduct towards the rest. This conduct consists, first, in not injuring the interests of one another; or rather certain interests which, either by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be considered as rights; and secondly, in each person's bearing his share (to be fixed on some equitable principle) of the labours and sacrifices incurred for defending the society or its members from injury and molestation. These conditions society is justified in enforcing, at all costs to those who endeavour to withhold fulfilment. Nor is this all that society may do. The acts of an individual may be hurtful to others, or wanting in due consideration for their welfare, without going the length of violating any of their constituted rights. The offender may then be justly punished by opinion though not by law. As soon as any part of a person's conduct affects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the question whether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by interfering with it, <b>becomes</b> <b>open</b> to discussion. But {{there is no room for}} entertaining any such question when a person's conduct affects the interests of no persons besides himself, or needs not affect them unless they like (all the persons concerned being of full age, and the ordinary amount of understanding). In all such cases there should be perfect freedom, legal and social, to do the action and stand the consequences.|$|E

50|$|Effect of precession. When {{the piston}} {{is at the}} top of the {{reciprocation}} cycle (commonly referred to as top-dead-center or just TDC), the connection between the trapped fluid chamber and the pump's discharge port is closed. Shortly thereafter, that same chamber <b>becomes</b> <b>open</b> to the pump's inlet port. As the piston continues to precess about the cylinder block axis, it moves away from the valve plate thereby increasing the volume of the trapped chamber. As this occurs, fluid enters the chamber from the pump's inlet to fill the void. This process continues until the piston reaches the bottom of the reciprocation cylinder - commonly referred to as bottom-dead-center or BDC. At BDC, the connection between the pumping chamber and inlet port is closed. Shortly thereafter, the chamber <b>becomes</b> <b>open</b> to the discharge port again and the pumping cycle starts over.|$|E
