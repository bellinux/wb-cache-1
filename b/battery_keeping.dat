Colonel S. Dobbin's brigade (composed of Dobbin's and C. Newton's regiments) was encamped at Legate's Bridge, on Bayou Meto.:A little before daylight (September 10), by direction of Colonel Dobbin, commanding division, moved section of B. Etter's battery into the bend opposite to where the bridge was being constructed. At day light could see workmen engaged in constructing the bridge, which was one-fourth of the way across the river. Sent Major Bull with a party of sharpshooters to support Etter. A little after daylight Etter opened upon the bridge. His second shot took effect, clearing the bridge of workmen. Immediately the enemy opened with three batteries, so posted as to pour a murderous cross-fire in upon Etter, which soon silenced him and drove him out. The sharpshooters kept up a desultory fire, but without much, if any, effect. About 10 a. m. the enemy, having completed his bridge, threw forward two regiments of infantry, and crossed them over onto the bar on this side, his <b>batteries</b> <b>keeping</b> up a continuous and well-directed fire upon the road leading up the river on the south side, and upon the woods in front of his bridge and above it. I withdrew Major Corley to a point above the bridge on the river, and sent Etter on up the river with instructions to halt at Fourche, whither I also sent Corley with his regiment in a few minutes. The enemy now commenced pouring their troops across the bridge in large numbers. By Colonel Dobbin's directions, I left Bull with his regiment to resist the enemy's advance and retard him as much as possible, and went in person to put the other troops in position at Fourche. Brigadier-General Marmaduke arrived with orders to assume command of all the cavalry.

Upon that day the enemy opened fire from several batteries. A shell penetrated the small room in the Residency in which Sir Henry Lawrence was sitting, and passed between him and his private secretary, Mr. Cowper. His officers begged him to change his room, but he declined to do so, saying laughingly that the room was so small that there was no chance of another shell finding its way in. He was, however, mistaken, for the very next day a shell entered, and burst in the room, the fragments inflicting a mortal wound upon Sir Henry, who died a few hours afterward. The loss was a heavy one indeed, both to the garrison, to whom his energy, calmness, and authority were invaluable, and to England, who lost in him one of her noblest and most worthy sons.

40|$|Shift of {{the focus}} from bulk {{generation}} to distributed generation is an established global trend in the power sector. Further the mode of distributed generations is shifting from dependence on fossil fuels to renewable sources. These sources are intermittent in nature and their generation pattern does not match the load pattern there by creating {{a need for a}} battery storage system. In this context, energy management presents itself as inevitable challenge in operating a grid connected distributed renewable sources. The challenge is due to factors such as intermittency of source, time of the day prices, sizing of solar panels and battery, limitations of charging and discharging rates of the battery. To address these, in this paper, an algorithm for energy management of grid-connected rooftop solar with battery storage is proposed. The objective is to maximize the savings in electricity bill by decreasing the power drawn from the grid during high grid prices. The charge controller of battery uses this algorithm for making decision on charging or discharging of the <b>battery</b> or <b>keeping</b> it in idle mode. The algorithm is coded in MATLAB and tested with realistic demand patterns and solar generation patterns of data representing a duration of 30 days.

40|$|The NTNU Test Satellite project aims {{to launch}} a 10 x 10 x 20 cm nanosatellite, {{weighing}} less than 2. 66 kg. The satellite, which follows the CubeSat standard, is a relatively low cost project, and explores the use of comercially available, low cost electronic components in space. This work is mainly concerned with power management and distribution for NUTS, but also describes {{the design of a}} system backplane. The thesis is split into two parts. The first describes the design and evaluation of the backplane with main focus on power distribution, and the second part describes battery charging and power conversion in the Electrical Power System (EPS) unit. The backplane has been designed with flexibility, fault-tolerance and simplicity in mind. The design is based on a single I 2 C bus with bus repeaters for each sub-module, with the ability to isolate individual modules from the system in case of a malfunction. Power is distributed with dual 3. 3 V and dual 5 V buses working in active redundancy, ensuring continued operation should a voltage converter fail. Power distribution for each module consists of three parts: power supply or-ing, current-limit switch and power monitor, and is integrated into the backplane. The state of the power switches and bus repeaters are controlled from two master modules, and a watchdog timer ensures return to a default state should both master modules be disabled. The proposed solution integrates all the management logic and power distribution circuitry into the backplane itself, leaving the valuable PCB space on the sub-modules free for module implementations. The power distribution unit has been evaluated with a separate prototype, and displays good performance in terms of power losses and response to over-current conditions. A prototype implementation of the backplane has been produced. The electrical power system of the satellite consists of solar panels, batteries, and voltage converters. With very limited power available, the main focus of the design has been to reduce losses in power conversion. A battery charge regulator (BCR) has therefore been proposed, which charges the <b>battery</b> while <b>keeping</b> the solar panels at their maximum operating point. This integrates a Maximum Power Point Tracking stage with a battery charger into a single converter, greatly increasing efficiency. Redundancy can be achieved by using separate converters for separate panels in parallel. A prototype BCR has been tested, and initial results show over 91 % converter efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Blind {{rendezvous}} is {{a fundamental}} problem in wireless networks. Rendezvous problems involve a collection of agents, or nodes, each of which would like to discover and communicate with the other agents in the collection who are within its transmission range. Two agents are said to rendezvous when they become aware of one another {{and are able to}} communicate. Blindness refers to a set of constraints on any algorithm that is to guarantee rendezvous in a typical wireless network. Agents begin with no knowledge of one another and have no means of coordination other than the common radio channels available to them. Agents are typically not synchronized, so different agents may be deployed with their clocks offset from one another by some amount. Individual agents are identical. This means that two agents operating on a common rendezvous protocol can only make decisions based on their clock readings and on their experiences since deployment. They cannot act differently based on a distinction between their individual identities. Problems of this nature take different forms in various wireless settings. This dissertation describes two different blind rendezvous problems: The multi-channel rendezvous problem pertains to cognitive radio networks where each node has access to a potentially different subset of the radio spectrum, and can only utilize a single radio frequency at one time. The challenge here is achieving rendezvous between agents who each do not know what channel their neighbor will be using at any given time.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems, Energy, Environment and Society, 2010 For the 1. 6 {{billion people}} in the world who lack access to electricity, the {{flashlight}} serves as a simple but important lighting device. In contrast to traditional incandescent flashlights, incorporating light emitting diode (LED) technology into flashlights presents a potentially less polluting, more efficient and cost-effective alternative lighting source. To avoid market spoiling as LED technology is introduced into off-grid lighting markets it is essential that quality be assured. This study addresses the quality of flashlights available to low-income flashlight users in Kenya. Lab-based performance testing of three commonly used models shows that flashlights perform substantially below rated specifications. Models tested had battery capacities that were 50 % below rated levels and required up to 25 % more time to charge the battery than advertised. Frequent users of flashlights expressed high levels of dissatisfaction with available flashlights; 87 % reported having problems with their flashlight in the last six months. Failed LEDs (23 %), water leakage (21 %), and <b>batteries</b> no longer <b>keeping</b> their charge (16 %) were among the most common problems. The median reported lifespan of a flashlight was two months. Users interviewed indicated that the cost of flashlight ownership absorbed up to 7. 4 % of their annual income. In addition, the potential health and environmental risks associated with flashlight use are substantial. Estimates indicate that more than 700, 000 kg of lead are discarded and over 30, 000 m 3 of waste are produced annually from the use of low quality flashlights in Kenya. Scenarios illustrating the impact of marketing an affordable, improved quality flashlight indicate a potential 80 % reduction of waste and lead disposal and up to a 65 % cost-savings for flashlight users. Results obtained from this study are useful for creating a framework for quality assurance of low-cost flashlights products, helping to reduce the social, economic, health and environmental implications of low-cost flashlights in Kenya and elsewhere around the world...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} mobile GPUs {{is all about}} saving energy. Smartphones and tablets are {{battery-operated}} and thus any type of rendering needs to use as little energy as possible. Furthermore, smartphones do not include sophisticated cooling systems due to their small size, making heat dissipation a primary concern. Improving the energy-efficiency of mobile GPUs will be absolutely necessary to achieve the performance required to satisfy consumer expectations, while maintaining operating time per <b>battery</b> charge and <b>keeping</b> the GPU in its thermal limits. The first step in optimizing energy consumption is to identify the sources of energy drain. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} the register file {{is one of the main}} sources of energy consumption in a GPU. As graphics workloads are highly data- and memory-parallel, GPUs rely on massive multithreading to hide the memory latency and keep the functional units busy. However, aggressive multithreading requires a huge register file to keep the registers of thousands of simultaneous threads. Such a big register file exceeds the power budget typically available for an embedded graphics processors and, hence, more energy-efficient memory latency tolerance techniques are necessary. On the other hand, prior research showed that the off-chip accesses to system memory are one of the most expensive operations in terms of energy in a mobile GPU. Therefore, optimizing memory bandwidth usage is a primary concern in mobile GPU design. Many bandwidth saving techniques, such as texture compression or ARM's transaction elimination, have been proposed in both industry and academia. The purpose of this thesis is to study the characteristics of mobile graphics processors and mobile workloads in order to propose different energy saving techniques specifically tailored for the low-power segment. Firstly, we focus on energy-efficient memory latency tolerance. We analyze several techniques such as multithreading and prefetching and conclude that they are effective but not energy-efficient. Next, we propose an architecture for the fragment processors of a mobile GPU that is based on the decoupled access/execute paradigm. The results obtained by using a cycle-accurate mobile GPU simulator and several commercial Android games show that the decoupled architecture combined with a small degree of multithreading provides the most energy efficient solution for hiding memory latency. More specifically, the decoupled access/execute-like design with just 4 SIMD threads/processor is able to achieve 97...|$|R
40|$|As {{the state}} of the {{environment}} deteriorates due to the large energy consumption in the world, the importance of green technologies like photovoltaic (PV) generators and electric vehicles (EVs) increases. Both are making their appearance as common technologies in the modern life. However, separately these technologies can have bad influences on distribution networks. Fortunately, PV and EV have a natural synergy: when the PV energy is stored directly in the EV batteries, the currents to and from the grid can be kept within limits. To enable this synergy, the EVs should be charged during the peak hours of the sun and the EVs should be connected directly to the PV panels. This thesis presents different strategies of charging EVs at an office with PV arrays, in order to integrate large amounts of PV and EV without causing any grid violations. A general framework for the different strategies is developed, containing an aggregator, the EV charging stations and a grid monitoring system. Three different ways of mitigating grid violations when they would appear are defined, and each of these start charging either at maximum charging power or average charging power. The strategies make real-time choices based on {{the state of}} the EVs and the grid. In this way, the EVs will be fully charged upon departure (typical constant current/constant voltage mode charging for lithium-ion <b>batteries</b> included) while <b>keeping</b> the transformer power, the line currents and the node voltages within the limits. The first charging strategy shares the violation mitigation among all EVs: the charging power of all available EVs are adjusted in low extend in order to create more balance in the power flows. The second charging strategy makes use of location-dependent violation mitigation: only the EVs at the location with the most impact are adjusted. In this way, the violation will be mitigated as effective as possible, so by adjusting the least amount of aggregated charging power. The third charging strategy ranks the EVs based in their energy demand, remaining connection time and their location. Then the most flexible EVs are adjusted as much as they can in order to mitigate grid violations. In this case there is not a large fleet in which all EVs have to adjust in low extend, but there are a few EV that have to adjust in large extend. In this way, the least EVs are affected by the violation mitigation. The results show that charging at average charging power has many more benefits than charging at maximum charging power, especially in case of a lot of solar power generation. Besides, it is found that fair sharing of grid violation mitigation results in the least losses because of the flat current profiles they cause. Unfair sharing results in large current peaks, more losses and current violations besides the voltage violations. Adjusting less EVs in larger extend is more effective than adjusting many EVs in small extend, because it takes the EV parameters into account: in this way the least flexible EVs are spared and will not cause any problems at the end of the day.
