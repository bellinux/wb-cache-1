2500|$|Giromill: A subtype of Darrieus turbine with straight, {{as opposed}} to curved, blades. The cycloturbine variety has {{variable}} pitch to reduce the torque pulsation and is self-starting. The advantages of variable pitch are: high starting torque; a wide, relatively flat torque curve; [...] a higher coefficient of performance; more efficient operation in turbulent winds; and a lower <b>blade</b> <b>speed</b> ratio which lowers blade bending stresses. Straight, V, or curved blades may be used.|$|E

It is necessary to keep the wind <b>blade</b> tip <b>speed</b> to obtain maximum power. The wind <b>blade</b> <b>speeds</b> significantly affect the energy losses and the power coefficients. It is required to keep the wind <b>blade</b> tip <b>speed</b> to obtain the maximum power coefficient and minimum energy loss. The dynamic problems of the wind turbine generators are formulated by employing the differential quadrature method. The Euler-Bernoulli beam model is used to characterize the wind turbine generator blade. The differential quadrature method is used to transform the partial differential equations that present the dynamic behavior of the wind turbine generator blades into a discrete eigenvalue problem. The {{results show that the}} rotation speed could affect the frequencies of the wind generators. The inclined angle could not affect the frequencies of the wind generators significantly...|$|R
40|$|Ceramic {{turbines}} {{have long}} promised to enable higher fuel efficiencies by accommodating higher temperatures without cooling, yet no engines with ceramic rotors are in production today. Studies cite life, reliability, and cost obstacles, often concluding that further {{improvements in the}} materials are required. In this paper, we assume instead that the problems could be circumvented by adjusting the engine design. Detailed analyses are conducted for two key life-limiting processes, water vapor erosion and slow crack growth, seeking engine design strategies for mitigating their effects. We show that highly recuperated engines generate extremely low levels of water vapor erosion, enabling lives exceeding 10, 000 hours, without environmental barrier coatings. Recuperated engines are highly efficient at low pressure ratios, making low <b>blade</b> <b>speeds</b> practical. Many ceramic demonstration engines have had design point mean <b>blade</b> <b>speeds</b> near 550 m/s. A CARES/Life analysis of an example rotor designed for about half this value indicates vast improvements in SCG-limited life and reliability. Lower <b>blade</b> <b>speeds</b> also reduce foreign object damage (FOD) particle kinetic energy {{by a factor of}} four. In applications requiring very high fuel efficiency that can accept a recuperator, or in short-life simple cycle engines, ceramic turbines are ready for application today...|$|R
50|$|A fixed-speed HAWT (Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine) {{inherently}} increases its {{angle of}} attack at higher wind <b>speed</b> as the <b>blades</b> <b>speed</b> up. A natural strategy, then, is to allow the blade to stall when the wind speed increases. This technique was successfully used on many early HAWTs. However, {{on some of these}} blade sets, it was observed that the degree of blade pitch tended to increase audible noise levels.|$|R

50|$|In {{this case}} the change in {{enthalpy}} is across the whole unit, not just a stage. Similarly, the <b>blade</b> <b>speed</b> used is a mean for the whole device.|$|E
5000|$|Changes in blade-section motion {{relative}} to the observer as the steadily loaded propeller rotates, generally referred to as [...] "loading" [...] noise. This source tends to dominate at low <b>blade</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
50|$|During {{experimental}} evaluation, cyclorotors produced little aerodynamic noise. This {{likely due to}} {{the lower}} <b>blade</b> tip <b>speeds,</b> which produce lower intensity turbulence following the blades.|$|R

Range of the work-speed parameter lambda considered includes low to moderate <b>blade</b> <b>speeds</b> with high specific work outputs, where critical turbojet, turbopump, and accessory-drive turbines are encountered. A diffusion factor of 0. 5 limits the loading on the downstream stators. Turbine efficiences considered are total or aerodynamic, rating, and static. Efficiences of velocity-diagram types at impulse and that corresponding to values of maximum efficiency are presented and compared to indicate in what range of lambda downstream stators are beneficial {{as well as}} the attending improvements in efficiency...|$|R

50|$|Another most design {{consideration}} {{is the average}} stage loading. This can be kept at a sensible level either by {{increasing the number of}} compression stages (more weight/cost) or the mean <b>blade</b> <b>speed</b> (more blade/disc stress).|$|E
50|$|The above {{equation}} {{shows that}} if <b>blade</b> <b>speed</b> cannot be increased for, say, mechanical or aerodynamic reasons, {{the number of}} stages has to be increased to get theaverage stage loading back to an acceptable level, to obtain a satisfactory level of efficiency. The ideal average stage loading for a turbine is about 1.8.|$|E
50|$|Players {{have many}} choices and {{variations}} in rubber sheets on their racquet. Although a racquet may be purchased assembled with rubber by the manufacturer, most serious tournament players {{will use a}} custom racquet. A player selects a blank blade (i.e., a racquet without rubber) based {{on his or her}} playing style. The type of wood or synthetic layers used to make up the blade will determine the <b>blade's</b> <b>speed.</b> The different types of rubber sheets affect the level of spin, speed, and other specific playing characteristics. Racquet construction and new rubber technology contribute significantly to the amount of deviation from the expected ball flight path.|$|R

He was chosen {{as one of the}} best heavy drummers in 1992 through a national contest, promoted by the magazine Drums & Percussion. In 1993 he toured Brazil as guest drummer for Metal <b>Blade's</b> <b>speed</b> metal band Garcia Garcia.

50|$|Propellers {{are only}} {{suitable}} for use at subsonic airspeeds up to around 480 mph (770 km/h), as above this <b>speed</b> the <b>blade</b> tip <b>speed</b> begins to go supersonic, with the consequent shockwaves causing high drag and other mechanical difficulties.|$|R
50|$|If all fluid {{velocities}} at corresponding points {{within the}} turbomachine {{are in the}} same direction and proportional to the <b>blade</b> <b>speed,</b> then the operating condition of a turbomachine at two different rotational speeds will be dynamically similar.If two points,each on dissimilar head-flow characteristics curve, represent similar dynamic operation of the turbo machine, then the non-dimensional variables (ignoring Reynolds number effects) will have same values.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} blades is {{selected}} for aerodynamic efficiency, component costs, and system reliability. Noise emissions {{are affected by the}} location of the blades upwind or downwind of the tower and the speed of the rotor. Given that the noise emissions from the blades' trailing edges and tips vary by the 5th power of <b>blade</b> <b>speed,</b> a small increase in tip speed can make a large difference.|$|E

50|$|When {{the rotor}} blade is {{perpendicular}} to the aircraft and advancing, its tip airspeed Vt is the aircraft <b>speed</b> plus relative <b>blade</b> tip <b>speed,</b> or Vt=V+u. At mu=1, V is equal to u and the tip airspeed is twice the aircraft speed.|$|R
5000|$|For rotorcraft, {{advance ratio}} (or Mu, symbol [...] ) {{is defined as}} the {{aircraft}} forward speed V divided by its relative <b>blade</b> tip <b>speed.</b> Upper mu limit is a critical design factor for rotorcraft, and the optimum for traditional helicopters is around 0.4.|$|R

50|$|Paper that is creped is {{produced}} {{on a paper}} machine that has a single large steam-heated drying cylinder (yankee) fitted with a hot-air hood. The raw material is paper pulp. The Yankee cylinder is sprayed with adhesives to make the paper stick. Crêping {{is done by the}} Yankee's doctor blade that is scraping the dry paper off the cylinder surface. The crinkle (crêping) is controlled by the strength of the adhesive, geometry of the doctor <b>blade,</b> <b>speed</b> difference between the yankee and final section of the paper machine and paper pulp characteristics.|$|E
50|$|As {{bypass ratio}} increases, the mean radius {{ratio of the}} fan and {{low-pressure}} turbine (LPT) increases. Consequently, if the fan is to rotate at its optimum <b>blade</b> <b>speed</b> the LPT blading will spin slowly, so additional LPT stages will be required, to extract sufficient energy to drive the fan. Introducing a (planetary) reduction gearbox, with a suitable gear ratio, between the LP shaft and the fan enables both the fan and LP turbine to operate at their optimum speeds. Typical of this configuration are the long-established Honeywell TFE731, the Honeywell ALF 502/507, and the recent Pratt & Whitney PW1000G.|$|E
50|$|The {{most widely}} used small wind {{generator}} produced for American farms in the 1930s was a two-bladed horizontal-axis machine manufactured by the Wincharger Corporation. It had a peak output of 200 watts. <b>Blade</b> <b>speed</b> was regulated by curved air brakes near the hub that deployed at excessive rotational velocities. These machines were still being manufactured in the United States during the 1980s. In 1936, the U.S. started a rural electrification project that killed the natural market for wind-generated power, since network power distribution provided a farm with more dependable usable energy for a given amount of capital investment.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} {{position}} {{on the opposite side}} (retreating blade), the tip airspeed is the aircraft <b>speed</b> minus relative <b>blade</b> tip <b>speed,</b> or Vt=V-u. At mu=1, the tip airspeed is zero. At a mu between 0.7 and 1.0, most of the retreating side has reverse airflow.|$|R

50|$|The {{helicopter}} {{is controlled}} using a two lever control unit. The controls operate {{similar to a}} real helicopter. The throttle control provides proportional control of the <b>blade</b> <b>speed.</b> The pitch control provides for tilting the Vertibird forward or backward. During flight the VertiBird {{is subject to the}} same physical flight characteristics as a real helicopter. This included ground-effects for low level hovering, plus altitude gains and losses when changing direction. Overall the VertiBird is easy to learn how to pilot for basic flight, but precision flying will require some patience and time on the controls as in a real helicopter.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{efficiency}} {{is lower than}} that of a turbine with constant air stream direction and asymmetric airfoil. One reason for the lower {{efficiency is}} that symmetric airfoils have a higher drag coefficient than asymmetric ones, even under optimal conditions. Also, in the Wells turbine, the symmetric airfoil runs partly under high angle of attack (i.e., low <b>blade</b> <b>speed</b> / air speed ratio), which occurs during the air velocity maxima of the oscillating flow. A high angle of attack causes a condition known as [...] "stall" [...] in which the airfoil loses lift. The efficiency of the Wells turbine in oscillating flow reaches values between 0.4 and 0.7.|$|E
50|$|A propeller's {{performance}} suffers as the <b>blade</b> <b>speed</b> {{nears the}} transonic. As the relative air speed at any {{section of a}} propeller is a vector sum of the aircraft speed and the tangential speed due to rotation, a propeller blade tip will reach transonic speed well before the aircraft does. When the airflow over {{the tip of the}} blade reaches its critical speed, drag and torque resistance increase rapidly and shock waves form creating a sharp increase in noise. Aircraft with conventional propellers, therefore, do not usually fly faster than Mach 0.6. There have been propeller aircraft which attained up to the Mach 0.8 range, but the low propeller efficiency at this speed makes such applications rare.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the design of}} fault diagnosis for Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS). In this approach, the residual signal is generated by a fuzzy observer {{which is based on}} Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy models based on Lyapunov function. The approach presented takes into account the stability and design of non-linear fuzzy inference systems based also on TS fuzzy models. The paper derives the necessary conditions for the assignability of eigenvalues to a region in the s-plane and the necessary conditions to guarantee the stability of fuzzy models. The problem is solved via the Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) method. The proposed TS observer is used for detection and isolation of faults which can affect a TS model.
