5|$|Those {{with the}} skills and {{inclination}} to write Welsh recipes, the upper classes, conformed to English styles and therefore would not have run their houses with traditional Welsh cuisine.

Others are refurbished and resold, or may just have their emergency equipment removed {{to be sold to}} private businesses or individuals, who then can use them as small recreational vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Armies facing {{service in}} {{different}} theatres may need several different camouflage uniforms. Separate issues of temperate/jungle and desert camouflage uniforms are common.

Helmets often have netting covers; some jackets have small loops for the same purpose. Being able to find appropriate camouflage vegetation or in other ways modify the issued battle uniform to suit the local terrain is an important skill for infantry soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Basic indoor venues may <b>be</b> <b>adapted</b> gymnasiums, {{which can}} easily {{accommodate}} high jump competitions and short track events.

Typically, a central area {{is surrounded by}} a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.|$|E
