50|$|Starting in 1942, {{remaining}} PzB 39 rifles were rebuilt with a shortened barrel (590 mm) and an affixed Schiessbecher ("firing cup") attachment threaded to {{the barrel}} {{and used to}} launch standard rifle grenades. The cup was the standard type used with the ubiquitous Kar 98k infantry rifle and the ammunition was also interchangeable; there were three types of grenades: an anti-personnel grenade, a light anti-tank grenade and a large-diameter anti-tank grenade. The grenades were propelled by a special cartridge with a <b>wood</b> <b>bullet.</b> The rifle was also outfitted with a special sighting arrangement for firing up to 150 m and the wooden forend was removed. These converted rifles received the designation Granatbüchse Modell 39 (GrB 39) and remained in use {{until the end of}} the war.|$|R
60|$|My {{awakening}} {{was like}} a nightmare. It came as a sudden blast of sound. I was only stupidly awake for the first moments and did nothing except to try to analyze and identify the various noises that went to compose the blast that continued without let up. I could hear near and distant explosions of rifles, shouts and curses of men, women screaming, and children bawling. Then I {{could make out the}} thuds and squeals of <b>bullets</b> that hit <b>wood</b> and iron in the wheels and under-construction of the wagon. Whoever it was that was shooting, the aim was too low. When I started to rise, my mother, evidently just in the act of dressing, pressed me down with her hand. Father, already up and about, at this stage erupted into the wagon.|$|R

6000|$|Heyward {{smiled to}} {{himself at the}} idea of a {{competition}} with the scout, though he determined to persevere in the deception, until apprised of the real designs of Magua. Raising his rifle with the utmost care, and renewing his aim three several times, he fired. The <b>bullet</b> cut the <b>wood</b> within a few inches of the vessel; and a general exclamation of satisfaction announced that the shot was considered a proof of great skill {{in the use of the}} weapon. Even Hawkeye nodded his head, as if he would say, it was better than he had expected. But, instead of manifesting an intention to contend with the successful marksman, he stood leaning on his rifle for more than a minute, like a man who was completely buried in thought. From this reverie he was, however, awakened by one of the young Indians who had furnished the arms, and who now touched his shoulder, saying, in exceedingly broken English,-- ...|$|R
40|$|The Naval Battle at Doggersbank The {{outcome of}} the {{encounter}} near Doggersbank (5 August 1781) between 7 Dutch and 7 British heavily armed men-of-war is remembered as a remarkable Dutch victory. Losses however were heavy: 104 dead and 3. 39 wounded in the British fleet, 140 dead and 404 wounded in the Dutch. Dutch medical information on this naval battle is very scarce. 24 Amputations were performed at sea; only 4 died from tetanus. The wounded were transported to the municipal hospital at Amsterdam which was brought in readiness hastily. In the Hospital Archives one only finds {{the names of the}} victims and the location of their wounds; no details about the treatment. Next to fractures, dislocations and wounds from <b>bullets</b> and flying <b>wood</b> one encounters severe burns: all typical hazards of the war at sea. One sailor with a devastating injury of his upper jaw and face, due to a cannonball, survived for 16 years. His deformed skull is on exhibit in the Leyden Pathological Institute. As a result of the generous financial contributions for the survivors of this naval battle or their next of kin a national foundation was created to stimulate interest for the navy. In 1784 a nautical college was inaugurated which still exists...|$|R
5000|$|Several {{developmental}} {{versions of}} ammunition were prepared beginning in 1910 before approximately 1,000 Pattern 1913 Enfield rifles with 600,000 rounds of RL18000C trials cartridges {{were distributed to}} troops in 1913. The great majority of troop trial ammunition was manufactured by the Royal Laboratory with the headstamp simply [...] "R^L", {{but it was also}} made by Kings Norton, Kynoch and Greenwood and Batley. Although the troop trial round was never formally approved, it was referred to as [...] "Cartridge S.A. Ball [...]276 inch Mark I" [...] in some documents and on the packet labels. The troops' trials rifles and ammunition were distributed to the musketry school at Hythe, to one squadron in each of three cavalry regiments, and to one company in each of eight infantry battalions. One of the cavalry squadrons was stationed in South Africa and one of the infantry companies was stationed in Egypt. The remainder of the units were in the United Kingdom. Cartridges were packaged in 5-round stripper clips similar to those used by the Mauser Gewehr 98 and M1903 Springfield rifles. Ball ammunition was loaded with 49.3 gr g of cordite MDT behind 165 gr g cupronickel-jacketed [...]282 in diameter 1.365 in long spitzer bullets. The bullet core was made of 98% lead and 2% antimony alloy. Drill rounds containing no primer or powder have been reported in two versions. One has a tin-plated case with the standard bullet, and the other has a round-nose <b>wood</b> <b>bullet</b> with an unplated brass case.Inert Dummy or Inspection, RL20408 blank and proof ammunition was also produced based on the case of RL 18000C. Proof test ammunition was made in a RL 18000.B(i) variant for use with pressure barrels and a RL 18000.B(j) variant for proofing rifles.|$|R
50|$|V G Siddhartha {{has taken}} 1.85 million {{hectares}} of Amazonian forestland on a 30-year lease from the Republic of Guyana in South America {{to start a}} furniture business in India. The idea is to transport cut logs on chartered ships from the Guyanese capital Georgetown to the Mangalore Port and then carry them via road to the Coffee Day Group’s furniture plant in Chikmagalur. The Amazonian hard wood varieties coming to Indian shores through this route will include Greenheart, Purpleheart, Wallaba and <b>Bullet</b> <b>Wood.</b> The royalty that Siddhartha will pay the Guyanese government is not clear. Siddhartha {{declined to comment on}} the matter. A couple of years ago, the Coffee Day Group had started a furniture unit to capitalize on the huge depository of full-grown silver oak, teak wood, rose wood and mahogany trees grown in its 15,000-acres of coffee gardens in Chikmagalur. The unit designs multi-purpose furniture for home, kitchen, office, hotels and retail outlets. It also manufactures all kinds of plywood, wood boards, panel sheets and beadings, making use of the wood waste and saw powder. But it has so far remained mostly as a captive unit, serving the requirements of the Group’s coffee outlets and the resorts under the brand name Serai.|$|E
5000|$|The Tak Bat Dok Mai Ceremony (ประเพณีตักบาตรดอกไม้) is {{considered}} a significant tradition of Phra Phutthabat District. This merit-making ceremony is held {{to coincide with the}} start of the annual three-month Buddhist Lent {{on the first day of}} the waning moon of the eighth lunar month. During the ceremony, people offer alms to monks and candles to Wat Phra Phutthabat, early in the morning. In the afternoon, they offer flowers to the monks at Wat Phra Phutthabat Ratchaworamahawihan, Khun Khlon Sub-district, Phra Phutthabat District. They go to collect a kind of flower similar to Krachai (Rotunda) or turmeric with yellow or white flowers called [...] "The Flower of Buddhist Lent". This herb-like flower is found on the hillside only during the Buddhist Lent period and only in Saraburi. While the monks are walking up the staircase to take the flowers to pay homage to the Lord Buddha's footprint, people wait along the steps with bowls of clean water in which are floated <b>bullet</b> <b>wood</b> flowers. They pour the water onto the feet of the monks as a means of washing away their sins. The Flower of Buddhist Lent was listed as a new species of plant in the world in the International Flowers Fair in July 2001 at Jurong Bird Park in Singapore.|$|E
