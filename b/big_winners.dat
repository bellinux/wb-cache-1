25|$|In 1952, Buffett married Susan Thompson at Dundee Presbyterian Church. The {{next year}} {{they had their}} first child, Susan Alice. In 1954, Buffett {{accepted}} a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year (about $ today). There he worked closely with Walter Schloss. Graham was a tough boss. He was adamant that stocks provide a wide margin of safety after weighing the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. The argument made sense to Buffett but he questioned whether the criteria were too stringent and caused the company {{to miss out on}} <b>big</b> <b>winners</b> that had other appealing features. That same year the Buffetts had their second child, Howard Graham. In 1956, Benjamin Graham retired and closed his partnership. At this time Buffett's personal savings were over $174,000 (about $ million today) and he started Buffett Partnership Ltd.|$|E

500|$|While the 1950s had {{multiple}} <b>big</b> <b>winners</b> (Herb Stempel and Charles Van Doren of Twenty One being {{two of the}} most notable), Teddy Nadler set the overall record during the 1956–57 television season, who set a record that would stand for the next two decades by winning $264,000 (...) on The $64,000 Challenge. The quiz show scandals of 1958 and 1959 prompted the cancellation of most of the big-budget game shows and the imposition of strict limits on prize amounts, which meant that through the 1960s and 1970s, game show contestants could not match their 1950s counterparts.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The Daily Telegraph, pundit Alan Hansen {{felt the}} ease in which Manchester United {{dominated}} the final and Arsenal's inability to vary tactics highlighted why Wenger {{needed to make}} changes in the close season. Hansen agreed with Ferguson that United's lack of goal threat cost them on the day, but felt their future was rosier than Arsenal's. Nonetheless, he was of the opinion that Chelsea manager José Mourinho had little to be concerned about, concluding his piece with the sentence: [...] "A London club did come away from Cardiff as <b>big</b> <b>winners</b> but it was not Arsenal, it was Chelsea." [...] In the same newspaper, Paul Hayward praised the performances of Rooney and Ronaldo – [...] "surely the best one-club pairing of under-21s in world football," [...] while ex-Arsenal player Alan Smith noted his former club's win demonstrated how Wenger [...] "for the first time, practically, in his nine-year Highbury tenure, had set up his side with the opposition in mind." [...] Capturing United's sombre mood, The Times football correspondent Matt Dickinson wrote: [...] "The black shirts {{turned out not to be}} in protest at Glazer but a reflection of their mood after the first FA Cup Final to be decided by a penalty shoot-out." ...|$|E
