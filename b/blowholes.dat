5|$|Baleen whales {{have two}} {{flippers}} on the front, near the head. Like all mammals, baleen whales breathe air and must surface periodically to do so. Their nostrils, or <b>blowholes,</b> are {{situated at the}} top of the cranium. Baleen whales have two <b>blowholes,</b> as opposed to toothed whales which have one. These paired <b>blowholes</b> are longitudinal slits that converge anteriorly and widen posteriorly, which causes a V-shaped blow. They are surrounded by a fleshy ridge that keeps water away while the whale breathes. The septum that separates the <b>blowholes</b> has two plugs attached to it, making the <b>blowholes</b> water-tight while the whale dives.|$|E
5|$|It has paired <b>blowholes</b> on a {{prominent}} splashguard and a broad, flat, V-shaped rostrum. A single median ridge stops {{well short of}} the rostrum tip. A light V-shaped marking, the chevron, begins behind the <b>blowholes</b> and extends back and then forward again.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{southern}} right whales are seen with rolls of fats behind <b>blowholes</b> that northern species often lack, {{and these are}} regarded {{as a sign of}} better health condition due to sufficient nutrition supply, and could have contributed in vast differences in recovery status between right whales in southern and northern hemisphere, other than direct impacts by mankind.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>blowhole</b> attracts 600,000 {{tourists}} a year. Kiama <b>Blowhole</b> {{is just a}} few metres {{beyond the}} coastline. The [...] "little blowhole" [...] is located at the Little <b>Blowhole</b> Reserve, Tingira Crescent, Kiama, a few minutes' drive south of the main <b>blowhole.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hummanaya <b>Blowhole</b> is {{the only}} known <b>blowhole</b> in Sri Lanka and it is {{considered}} to be the second largest <b>blowhole</b> in the world. [...] "Hummanaya" [...] (Sinhala: හුම්මානය = හූ+මානය) refers to the noise, [...] "hoo", that can be heard a distance away when the <b>blowhole</b> is active.|$|R
5000|$|Coney Island was {{the base}} for Dr. <b>Blowhole</b> in the Penguins of Madagascar episode, [...] "Dr. <b>Blowhole's</b> Revenge" [...] where the {{penguins}} discovered where he was so they can rescue King Julien and defeat <b>Blowhole.</b>|$|R
5|$|Whales are {{air-breathing}} mammals {{who must}} surface {{to get the}} air they need. The stubby dorsal fin is visible soon after the blow (exhalation) when the whale surfaces, but disappears {{by the time the}} flukes emerge. Humpbacks have a , heart-shaped to bushy blow through the <b>blowholes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes, such as {{the sperm}} whale, possess teeth with {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of the}} tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Only in larger whales, where the cementum is worn away on the tip of the tooth, does enamel show. Mysticetes have large whalebone, as opposed to teeth, made of keratin. Mysticetes have two <b>blowholes,</b> whereas Odontocetes contain only one.|$|E
5|$|Papa Stour {{is one of}} the Shetland Islands in Scotland, with a {{population}} of under twenty people, some of whom immigrated after an appeal for residents in the 1970s. Located to the west of mainland Shetland and with an area of 828hectares (3.2square miles), Papa Stour is the eighth largest island in Shetland. Erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves, stacks, arches, <b>blowholes,</b> and cliffs. The island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife. The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around the island are a Special Area of Conservation.|$|E
5000|$|The Kiama <b>Blowhole</b> is a <b>blowhole</b> in {{the town}} of Kiama, New South Wales, Australia. It is the town's major tourist attraction. Under certain sea conditions, the <b>blowhole</b> can spray water up to 25 metres (82 ft) in the air, in {{quantities}} that thoroughly drench any bystanders. There is a second, less famous <b>blowhole</b> in Kiama, commonly referred to as the [...] "Little Blowhole" [...] by locals. It is much smaller than the other (called the [...] "Big Blowhole"), but due to its narrow shape, it is more reliable than the Big <b>Blowhole,</b> and in the right conditions can be equally spectacular.|$|R
5000|$|Nakalele Point {{is famous}} for a <b>blowhole</b> which {{produces}} powerful geyser-like water spouts with the waves and tides. Water spewed from the <b>blowhole</b> can rise as high as 100 feet in the air. Visitors to the site should never stand between the <b>blowhole</b> and the ocean, and visitors should never turn their backs on the ocean as rogue waves could cause injury at anytime. Only one person is confirmed to have been sucked into the <b>blowhole</b> and died. http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/15085685/blowhole-dangers-caught-on-tape ...|$|R
50|$|In geology, a <b>blowhole</b> {{is formed}} as sea caves grow landwards and upwards into {{vertical}} shafts and expose themselves towards the surface, which {{can result in}} blasts {{of water from the}} top of the <b>blowhole</b> if the geometry of the cave and <b>blowhole</b> and state of the weather are appropriate.|$|R
5|$|The first toothless {{ancestors}} of Mysticetes {{appeared before the}} first radiation in the late Oligocene. Eomysticetus {{and others like it}} showed no evidence in the skull of echolocation abilities, suggesting they mainly relied on their eyesight for navigation. The eomysticetes had long, flat rostra that lacked teeth and had <b>blowholes</b> located halfway up the dorsal side of the snout. Though the palate is not well-preserved in these specimens, they are thought to have had baleen and been filter feeders. Miocene baleen whales were preyed upon by larger predators like killer sperm whales and Megalodon.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin {{has a single}} blowhole located on the dorsal surface of the head consisting of a hole and a muscular flap. The flap is closed during muscle relaxation and opens during contraction. Dolphins are voluntary breathers, who must deliberately surface and open their <b>blowholes</b> to get air. They can store almost twice as much oxygen in proportion to their body weight as a human can: the dolphin can store 36 milliliters (ml) of oxygen per kg of body weight, compared with 20 ml per kg for humans. This is an adaptation to diving. The {{bottlenose dolphin}} typically rises to the surface to breathe through its blowhole {{two to three times}} per minute, although it can remain submerged for up to 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Whales are {{descendants}} of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates). They {{are related to}} the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago. Primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic 5–10 million years later. What defines an archaeocete is the presence of anatomical features exclusive to cetaceans, alongside other primitive features not found in modern cetaceans, such as visible legs or asymmetrical teeth. Their features became adapted for living in the marine environment. Major anatomical changes included their hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone (Ambulocetus 49 mya), a streamlined body and the growth of flukes on the tail (Protocetus 43 mya), the migration of the nostrils toward the top of the cranium (<b>blowholes),</b> and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers (Basilosaurus 35 mya), and the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs (the first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 mya).|$|E

50|$|Jack's Bay {{is a small}} {{settlement}} in The Catlins, an area on the southeastern corner of the South Island of New Zealand. It is located six kilometres southwest of Owaka, close {{to the mouth of}} the Catlins River. A popular holiday spot with a seasonal population, there are numerous cribs (holiday homes) at the settlement. Jack's Bay is noted for a large <b>blowhole,</b> known as Jack's <b>Blowhole,</b> a 55-metre-deep <b>blowhole</b> that formed when part of a sea cavern's roof collapsed. The <b>blowhole</b> is 200 metres from the sea.|$|R
50|$|Kiama Lighthouse, on <b>Blowhole</b> Point, {{was built}} in 1887 and is {{situated}} close to the Kiama <b>Blowhole.</b> The point also contains a heritage pilot's cottage and a tourist information centre. North West of the <b>Blowhole</b> is Kiama Harbour, home to fishing boats and seafood market where you can buy local fish. The point also contains seaside cabins and a wonderful rock pool.|$|R
25|$|Tiny gas bubbles {{are called}} porosities, but larger gas bubbles are called <b>blowholes</b> or blisters. Such defects {{can be caused}} by air entrained in the melt, steam or smoke from the casting sand, or other gasses from the melt or mold. (Vacuum holes caused by metal {{shrinkage}} (see above) may also be loosely referred to as 'blowholes'). Proper foundry practices, including melt preparation and mold design, can reduce the occurrence of these defects. Because they are often surrounded by a skin of sound metal, <b>blowholes</b> may be difficult to detect, requiring harmonic, ultrasonic, magnetic, or X-ray (i.e., industrial CT scanning) analysis.|$|E
25|$|In areas, the {{southern}} ocean blows through many subterranean caves, resulting in <b>blowholes</b> {{up to several}} hundred metres from the coast. The Murrawijinie Cave in South Australia {{is open to the}} public, but most of the Nullarbor Caves on the Western Australian side can only be visited and viewed with a permit from the Department of Parks and Wildlife.|$|E
25|$|The {{gray whale}} has a dark slate-gray color and {{is covered by}} {{characteristic}} gray-white patterns, scars left by parasites which drop off in its cold feeding grounds. Individual whales are typically identified using photographs of their dorsal surface and matching the scars and patches associated with parasites that have fallen off the whale or are still attached. They have two <b>blowholes</b> {{on top of their}} head, which can create a distinctive heart-shaped blow at the surface in calm wind conditions.|$|E

5000|$|Hālona <b>Blowhole</b> is a rock {{formation}} and a <b>blowhole</b> {{on the island}} of Oahu, Hawaii off of Hanauma Bay at Hālona Point overlooking the Pacific Ocean. In Hawaiian hālona means [...] "lookout".|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Kiama" [...] {{is derived}} from the Aboriginal word [...] "kiarama", which means [...] "Place where the sea makes a noise". Kiama is also known as the place where the {{mountains}} touch the sea. This is in reference to the Kiama <b>Blowhole</b> which attracts a large number of visitors each year. The [...] "Little Blowhole" [...] is a lesser known <b>blowhole</b> as it does not share the same central location or the scale associated with the larger Kiama <b>Blowhole.</b> The Little <b>Blowhole</b> is on a headland south of the central part of Kiama between Easts and Kendalls Beaches.|$|R
25|$|The {{driving force}} in {{littoral}} cave development is wave action. Erosion is ongoing anywhere that waves batter rocky coasts, but where sea cliffs contain zones of weakness, rock is removed at a greater rate along these zones. As the sea reaches into the fissures thus formed, they begin to widen and deepen due to the tremendous force exerted within a confined space, not only by direct action of the surf and any rock particles that it bears, but also by compression of air within. <b>Blowholes</b> (partially submerged caves that eject large sprays of sea water as waves retreat and allow rapid re-expansion of air compressed within) attest to this process. Adding to the hydraulic power of the waves is the abrasive force of suspended sand and rock. Most sea-cave walls are irregular and chunky, reflecting an erosional process where the rock is fractured piece by piece. However, some caves have portions where the walls are rounded and smoothed, typically floored with cobbles, and result from the swirling motion of these cobbles in the surf zone.|$|E
25|$|Porpoising, {{also known}} as running, is a high speed surface {{behaviour}} of small cetaceans where long jumps are alternated with swimming close to the surface. Despite the name, porpoising behaviour is seen in dolphins and porpoises, {{as well as other}} marine species such as penguins and pinnipeds. When marine mammals are travelling at speed they are forced to stay close to the surface in order to maintain respiration for the energetic exercise. At leisurely cruising speeds below 4.6m/s, dolphins swim below the water's surface and only briefly expose their <b>blowholes</b> along with up to one third of their body at any one time. This results in little splashing as they have a very streamlined shape. Porpoising occurs mainly when dolphins and porpoises are swimming at speeds greater than 4.6m/s. Here, jump length is roughly equal to distance traveled when the cetaceans are submerged. This exposes the blowhole for longer which is needed to get enough oxygen to maintain metabolism and therefore high speeds over long periods of time. Studies have also shown that leaping is more energetically efficient than swimming above a certain threshold speed. This is due to the reduction in friction when travelling in air compared to water which saves more energy than is needed to produce the leap. These benefits also outweigh the energy wasted due to the large amount of splashing often seen when groups are porpoising. Porpoising is therefore a result of high speed swimming which cetaceans use for important pursuit and escape activities. For example, dolphins may be seen porpoising away from their main predator, sharks or the direction of incoming boats to avoid collision.|$|E
500|$|The [...] baleen whales, {{also called}} {{whalebone}} whales or great whales, form the Mysticeti. Baleen whales {{are characterized by}} having baleen plates for filter feeding and two <b>blowholes.</b> During the embryonic phase, Mysticetes do have teeth but they are reabsorbed before birth ...|$|E

50|$|Kiama Light, {{also known}} as Kiama Harbour Light, is an active {{lighthouse}} in Kiama, New South Wales, Australia. The lighthouse is located close to the Kiama <b>Blowhole</b> on <b>Blowhole</b> Point, south of Kiama Harbour.|$|R
5|$|Their {{elongated}} {{upper and}} lower jaws form {{what is called a}} rostrum, or snout, which gives the animal its common name. The real, functional nose is the <b>blowhole</b> on top of its head; the nasal septum is visible when the <b>blowhole</b> is open.|$|R
500|$|The rugged, scenic {{coastline}} of the Catlins features sandy beaches, <b>blowholes,</b> a petrified {{forest at}} Curio Bay, and the Cathedral Caves, which visitors can reach at low tide. Much of the coastline consists of high cliffs, up to [...] in height, {{and the land}} rises sharply from the coast at most points. For this reason, many of the area's rivers cascade over waterfalls as they approach the ocean (notably the iconic Purakaunui Falls on the short Purakaunui River).|$|E
500|$|Erosion of {{the soft}} {{volcanic}} rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves, stacks, arches, <b>blowholes,</b> cliffs, voes and geos that are amongst the finest in Britain. The 'Holl o Boardie' is a cave that passes right through the north-west tip of the island. It is nearly half a mile long and wide enough to row through. Kirstan (or Christie's) Hole in the south west is another spectacular cave, part of the roof of which collapsed in 1981. Yet another is 'Francie's Hole' close to Hamna Voe in the west. This was the favourite of John Tudor who wrote of the island in his Victorian memoirs and described the cave as: ...|$|E
