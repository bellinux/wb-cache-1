GGBFS-FA geopolymer concrete with steel slag coarse aggregates are prepared by replacing natural granite aggregates at different replacement levels i. e. 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % (by volume) and various fresh and mechanical properties are studied. The flexural fatigue behaviour of GGBFS-FA geopolymer concrete with steel slag is also studied in detail. Efforts are also made to model the probabilistic distribution of fatigue data of GGBFS-FA geopolymer concrete at different stress levels using two parameters Weibull distribution. The results indicated that incorporation of steel slag in GGBFS-FA geopolymer concrete resulted in slight reduction in mechanical strength.

The biological impact of biochar on the phytopathology of a major cereal grain has not yet been investigated. The most damaging foliar disease of barley in the UK is Rhynchosporium leaf blotch caused by the hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen Rhynchosporium commune. The aim of this project was to evaluate biochar performance and effectiveness as a disease control agent in the barley – R. commune – pathosystem, and attempted to identify underlying mechanisms by which biochar may function in the interaction between barley and the causal pathogen. Therefore, a unique set of nine slow pyrolysis biochars were established along a 350 to 800 °C pyrolysis temperature gradient, with eight of these made from pelleted softwoods and a single one made from Miscanthus straw. A comprehensive biochar quality assessment was undertaken and established that the biochars differed in their chemical composition, which largely depended on production parameters, predominantly temperature (P < 0. 05). The analysis proposed that biochar 9, made from Miscanthus at 800 °C, showed added value as a soil conditioner over softwood biochars, due to higher pH, mineral ash and macronutrient recoveries, which pointed towards a possible liming potential.

This olive husk is usually carried from presses to an Olive Waste Management Center where a mechanical milling extraction process is performed to obtain Olive Pomace Oil. The remaining {{oil in the}} husk is chemically extracted and finally, the residual husk is used as fuel for a cogeneration process to produce electricity. The olive Pomace Oil from mechanical milling has higher quality and price than the one extracted chemically. As the seasonal olive collection campaign is from October to March, husk usually is stored and processed along the year. Due to the own husk chemical degradation and the constrained milling capacity, not all received husk is milled mechanically but always chemically. Different pools are used to store and classify husk qualities. There are pools for short, medium and long term horizons. Short term pools have low storage capacity and contains high quality husk which is shortly milled mechanically. Medium term pools have higher storage capacity containing medium quality husk. These mid term pools provide husk to be milled mechanically when the collection rate decreases, or the husk quality coming from presses is poor. Long term pools have also high storage capacity and store husk with poor quality to be processed only chemically. The stochastic model is focused on optimal pouring decisions into different types of pools to improve {{the efficiency of the}} husk mechanical milling. Several probabilistic scenarios of weekly husk pouring from presses are included in the stochastic programming model. Blending husk with different qualities brings nonlinear constraints into the computation of milling efficiency. To cope with these nonlinearities, an accurate approximation has been developed. A real case study is analyzed for different weeks along the collection campaign. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThe {{selection}} of the proper thermal energy storage (TES) material for an application is crucial. On the one hand, these materials should have suitable thermal properties for the operational temperatures range of the systems they are planned to work for, such as thermal stability, high latent heat and high heat capacity. On the other hand, they should be available {{on the market and}} at low price. Besides, researchers have to bear in mind the importance of testing TES materials not only at laboratory scale but also at higher scale, since it has been demonstrated that some thermal characteristics are volume-dependant. In the present study, bischofite, a <b>by-product</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> the non-metallic industry in the North of Chile with desired thermal properties for mid-temperature applications (around 100 degrees C), has been studied. A first analysis was performed in terms of comparing the thermal properties and cost of bischofite with other material previously studied as TES materials in order to evaluate its potential in both latent and sensible phases. Afterwards, a second analysis was experimentally performed in terms of testing bischofite at large-scale (204 kg) in a pilot plant facility. The experimental procedure consisted on several charging processes within two different temperatures ranges: from 50 degrees C to 80 degrees C and from 80 degrees C to 120 degrees C in order to study the behavior of the material in the sensible solid phase and latent phase respectively. The temperature profiles, the power given by the HTF, the energy balance in the storage system and the accumulation energy rate of the bischofite were analyzed. Results of both analysis showed that bischofite has potential as TES material for mid-temperature applications.

Whey protein concentrates were obtained by ultrafiltration of skimmed whey and Sorelho. The clarification <b>by-products</b> were <b>obtained</b> after the treatment of the skimmed whey and Sorelho by thermocalcic precipitation and microfiltration with two membranes (0. 20 and 0. 65 μm pore size). Next, the liophilization of the corresponding retentates was carried out. Each powder was added in three different mass ratios: 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 %. The addition of the powders caused higher yields of the whey cheese – mainly the one with the additional whey powder – but it did not affect the strength of the products. The retention of water and other components of whey and milk in the whey cheese was influenced by the protein composition of the powders. In relation to colour parameters, the whey cheese manufactured with ultrafiltration and microfiltration retentate powders showed lower values of ligthness than the control whey cheese – mainly the whey cheese with 1. 5 % of added powders.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a flue gas {{desulfurization}} (FGD) by-product {{was used to}} reconstruct the failed portion of a highway embankment. The construction process and {{the stability of the}} repaired embankment are examined. State Route 83 in Cumberland, Ohio has been damaged by a slow moving slide which has forced the Ohio Department of Transportation to repair the roadway several times. In the most recent repair FGD <b>by-products</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> American Electric Power`s Tidd PFBC plant were used to construct a wall through the failure plane to prevent further slippage. In order to evaluate the utility of using coal combustion by-products in this type of highway project the site was divided into three test sections. In the first repair section, natural soil removed form the slide area was recompacted and replaced according to standard ODOT construction practices. In the second section the natural soil was field mixed with the Tidd PFBC ash in approximately equal proportions. The third section was all Tidd ash. The three test sections were capped by a layer of compacted Tidd ash or crushed stone to provide a wearing surface to allow ODOT to open the roadway before applying a permanent asphalt surface. Measurement of slope movement as well as water levels and quality have begun at the site in order to evaluate long term project performance. The completion of this project should lead to increased acceptance of FGD materials in construction projects. Monetary savings will be realized in avoiding some of the disposal costs for the waste, {{as well as in the}} reduced reliance on alternative engineering materials...|$|R
