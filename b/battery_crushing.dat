50|$|The current {{caretaker}} of {{the site}} describes reconstructing the battery {{for use as a}} crusher in the early 1990s after an episode of vandalism left it in pieces. Reconstruction involved building an earth ramp and timber retaining wall, welding together pieces of the 5 head stamper battery that were found laying in pieces, bringing a jaw crusher from Mount Garnet and re-erecting the steam boiler. A corrugated iron shed was constructed over the <b>battery.</b> <b>Crushing</b> at the newly erected battery did not eventuate and the caretaker of the property currently uses the site as a storage area for machinery and other spare parts.|$|E
50|$|By 1899, Porter was {{the manager}} of the BB Quartz Gold Mining Company on BB Creek on the Jordan River goldfields, which his father had helped open up, back in 1862. His {{engineering}} skills helped this mine produce a record yield in its first seven months of <b>battery</b> <b>crushing</b> (i.e. 1,694 ounces of gold from 1,952 ton of rock). Porter also worked on the nearby Argyle Mine, erecting its poppet head. In 1901 Porter was employed as an engineer and shift boss in the Great South Long Tunnel Gold Mining Company in Walhalla, one of the mines digging Victoria’s richest gold-bearing quartz reef with shafts over 3,300 feet deep.|$|E
50|$|In 1921 the Richmond <b>battery</b> <b>crushed</b> 58 tons of tin ore from mines on the Stanhill tinfield. It is {{not known}} for how long the battery {{continued}} to operate.|$|R
5000|$|The 1930s saw a brief {{revival in}} the area then known as [...] "the Mount Moran group of gold mines". In 1936 the Mount Moran <b>Battery</b> <b>crushed</b> 157 tons of ore to yield 58 ounces of gold. However, there {{appears to have been}} no {{activity}} after this date. The Mount Moran Battery presumably ceased operation as the mines {{in the area}} closed.|$|R
2500|$|Encouraged by the prospects, the Standard Gold Mining Company was {{registered}} on 15 December 1874, with {{a capital}} of ₤3,000. A mine about [...] south of the town with a nearby five-stamp battery were built. The operation became the first to start mining in the state. However, recoveries {{failed to live up}} to expectations and the <b>battery</b> <b>crushed</b> only ten tons of ore before being closed when the company went into voluntary liquidation on 5 June 1876.|$|R
50|$|During the 1850s Ngati Maru {{were one}} of the main tribes {{providing}} large supplies of food to the new capital Auckland. Gold was discovered near Thames in 1852 which quickly changed from a small Maori kainga to a large European town of 40,000 people. Initially opinion was divided among the tribe whether they should allow Europeans access but they decided in favour when a government agent agreed to confine miners to one area, create a Maori police force to enforce this and pay Ngati Maru for every licence sold by the government. When gold was found by the sons of a chief he sent them to Auckland to spread the news and create a rush. Tension was created because under New Zealand law land on which gold was found could be purchased by the state. In some cases land was leased directly from Maori by large mining firms. The early gold diggers found alluvial gold which they could obtain by simple tools but quickly this ran out and was replaced by firms installing stamper <b>batteries</b> <b>crushing</b> gold bearing quartz.|$|R
40|$|Extract] The Emuford <b>Battery</b> <b>crushed</b> tin ore in the {{hinterland}} of Cairns, {{far north}} Queensland, between 1911 and 1985. It remains virtually intact, {{and is a}} museum of late nineteenth century and early twentieth century milling technology. Historic mill sites with such {{a high degree of}} intactness are uncommon, as most have been reduced to a few scraps of rusting metal. Discussed in this paper is the history of the mill, its physical characteristics {{and the ways in which}} the plant was modified over time and suggestions as to its remarkable state of preservation. Of these, the most important were: ownership by members of one family for much of its existence; the willingness of the State government to preserve it during periods when tin mining was not viable; and the poverty of the district that made modernisation of the plant too expensive. Finally, the heritage movement of recent years that has led to greater public recognition of mining heritage and conservation has ensured the battery's survival following the demise oftin mining in the district in 1985...|$|R
50|$|Water was {{a problem}} {{throughout}} the Croydon Goldfield and a large dam with a stone pitched wall was constructed in 1888, by a Mr. Shoemaker (or Schumacher). Even so the Homeward Bound <b>battery</b> could not <b>crush</b> that year.|$|R
25|$|In February 1807, he led his brigade at the Battle of Eylau {{where the}} VII Corps {{suffered}} very heavy losses. Ordered {{to attack the}} Russian left flank, Augereau's men soon disappeared into a blizzard. Losing their sense of direction, the corps instead assaulted the enemy center which was defended by a 70-gun <b>battery.</b> <b>Crushed</b> by artillery fire and ridden down by Russian cavalry the survivors fled. The shattered corps was later broken up and its units redistributed throughout the army. At the Battle of Friedland, Lapisse commanded the 2nd Division in Marshal Claude Perrin Victor's I Corps. The division included two battalions each of the 16th Light, 8th Line, 45th Line, and 54th Line Infantry Regiments. Michel Ney's VI Corps started the French attack from the right flank. When Ney's soldiers faltered, Emperor Napoleon committed the I Corps from the army reserve. As Victor's troops drove a wedge into the Russian center, Ney's corps returned to the attack on their right. Aided by Victor's exceptionally well-handled corps artillery, the French defeated the Russian Imperial Guard and fought their way into Friedland, ending the battle.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well-known}} {{that the quality}} of random number generators can often be improved by combining several generators, e. g. by summing or subtracting their results. In this paper we investigate the ratio of two random number generators as an alternative approach: the smaller of two input random numbers is divided by the larger, resulting in a rational number from [0, 1]. We investigate theoretical properties of this approach and show that it yields a good approximation to the ideal uniform distribution. To evaluate the empirical properties we use the well-known test suite TestU 01. We apply the ratio transformation to moderately bad generators, i. e. those that failed up to 40 % of the tests from the test <b>battery</b> <b>Crush</b> of TestU 01. We show {{that more than half of}} them turn into very good generators that pass all tests of Crush and BigCrush from TestU 01 when the ratio transformation is applied. In particular, generators based on linear operations seem to benefit from the ratio, as this breaks up some of the unwanted regularities in the input sequences. Thus the additional effort to produce a second random number and to calculate the ratio allows to increase the quality of available random number generators. Comment: 18 page...|$|R
50|$|The Homeward Bound <b>battery</b> {{commenced}} <b>crushing</b> on 28 February 1888 with 20 head of stamps. The main mines {{serving the}} battery were all situated along the Homeward Bound reef {{on or near}} the summit of the ridge above Waterfall Creek. Homeward Bound Extended Block No.1 North Company (with a nominal capital of £12,000 in 20,000 shares) owned several of the mines and Croydon Homeward Bound Gold Mining Company owned the battery. The 20 head of stamps and eight berdan pans were driven by a 20 hp portable steam engine. The plant was valued at £5,500.|$|R
50|$|A {{new company}} {{was formed in}} 1912 and the mine reopened after many years. A Victorian mine manager, David Morgan, was {{appointed}} as the new Tyrconnel mine manager. By early 1913 they had the winding gear and ore bins erected. The owners bought the Great Dyke Company's ten head battery at Caledonia Creek near Thornborough. T. Harley, engineer-in-charge, had the contract for £80 to transport the battery to its new position. Their first twelve weeks of crushings from the mine were impressive yielding 1,041 ounces of gold from 945 tons of stone (sent out to another <b>battery</b> for <b>crushing).</b> They installed a compressor in July 1913 and rock drills in September. In October they struck a reef almost 2.4 m wide which offered two to three ounce gold quartz. The mine shaft was then put in order in November for skips. By then the battery was almost ready and the headframe was being put in position. They also had a suction gas engine sitting at Dimbulah awaiting transport to the Hodgkinson. The <b>battery</b> started <b>crushing</b> in February 1914 but broke down in May because the engine bed plate broke. The company was doing very well through Morgan's careful management and William Keating's confidence. They were obtaining one ounce stone continually in 1914 and the battery kept going {{as long as there}} was water.|$|R
50|$|It {{was well}} known for its gold mining equipment, {{including}} stamper <b>batteries</b> and ore <b>crushing</b> mills, and {{played an important role}} in equipping Victoria's first mineral boom in the 1850s and '60s. Major facilities included a Bessemer converter (1887) and a cast-iron pipe-making shop which produced water, sewerage and hydraulic pipes, and structural columns, including those for Princes Bridge.|$|R
50|$|The Tyrconnel mine {{has been}} one of the richest {{producers}} on the Hodgkinson Goldfield. Discovered in 1876 it was originally taken up by Redmond and McVeigh on 20 April 1876. The first battery erected at the mine was Warde and Company's in November 1876, evidently financed by A. Forsythe in Brisbane, from whom this expensive ten head stamp battery took its name. This <b>battery</b> began <b>crushing</b> in February 1877 and the local proprietors, John Warde and Thomas E. White, renamed it the Brisbane in March 1877. In early 1879 they obtained a berdan pan for it, obtaining one from the Spring Gully mill which had been idle since June 1878.|$|R
40|$|CIVINSThe overall battery {{research}} of the Impact and Crashworthiness Laboratory (ICL) at MIT {{has been focused on}} understanding the battery’s mechanical properties so that individual battery cells and battery packs can be characterized during crash events.

50|$|The Bower Bird Battery of five stamps, four berdans, and {{concentrator}} {{was probably}} erected in 1895, after being relocated from other places. The stamper was already over 20 years old, having been manufactured in 1873. Between 1895 and 1897 the field's main producer the Victoria reef officially produced 930 tons of ore yielding 811 ozs of gold before being abandoned, possibly due to drought. It {{is not known}} whether the battery was also abandoned at this time or continued processing ore from other nearby reefs, such as the Lily of the Valley, Bertha and Two Mile, which yielded patches of alluvial gold. After 1900, a small quantity of ore was carted from shafts on May Downs station to the Bower Bird <b>battery</b> for <b>crushing,</b> with unknown results.|$|R
50|$|The brace {{was erected}} in 1909 on the New Gully shaft. The mine resumed {{in the middle}} of 1916 with {{dewatering}} to 91 m. The winding plant was reset on foundations and the machinery overhauled. Seventeen men were employed in 1917 mining in the No.2 and No.3 workings. 30.5 tons of tin ore were obtained for a return of five tons 13 cwt of tin valued at £1,016. The company's mill was expected to be commissioned in 1918. The Gully shaft was cleaned out in 1918 down to a rich body of ore at 12 m. The company was able to clear off its debt. The town <b>battery</b> started <b>crushing</b> in February 1918. That year it was the second highest producer on the field.|$|R

50|$|Cönders {{proposed}} {{the use of}} electrically activated charges to eliminate {{the problem of the}} premature ignition of the subsidiary charges, the problem experienced by the Lyman-Haskell gun. Cönders built a prototype of a 20 mm multi-chamber gun using machinery readily available at the Wetzlar plant, machinery that was producing tubes of this caliber for the Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns of 20 mm. The first tests were encouraging, but to get the support of the Ministry of arms, Hermann Röchling had to present to Albert Speer Cönders' project of a cannon capable of firing on London from the coast of the Pas-de-Calais.

50|$|The {{influx of}} prospectors and investors {{to the area}} created the {{beginnings}} of Coolgarra, which became a busy tin mining centre. Coolgarra was surveyed on 9 February 1884 by Peter G. Grant. As tin prices increased, many southern speculators were eager to join Delaney and on 16 April 1883 they formed the Beaconsfield Tin Mining Company with a capital of 25,000 pounds. They planned to erect a <b>battery</b> to <b>crush,</b> not only ore from their own numerous leases, but public stone as well. However, the machinery needed for these works was delayed, firstly in transit and then later in its construction. The Beaconsfield battery did not begin crushing until March 1884, {{at the end of}} the wet season, and the venture failed. During this time, Coolgarra's miners had been sending their ore to John Moffat's batteries at Herberton and Watsonville.|$|R

50|$|The Davis Mill is a {{historic}} stamp mill located off of North Bloomfield Road northeast of Nevada City, California. The mill served the Randolph Mine, a small gold mine run by the Davis family, from 1915 to 1940. It included the standard machinery of an early 20th century stamp mill, which consisted of a stamp <b>battery,</b> a rock <b>crusher,</b> an ore bin, an amalgamation table, concentrators, and a retort room. These parts were enclosed in a multi-story metal structure. The components and layout of the mill are well-preserved, providing {{an example of how}} miners processed ore in a stamp mill.|$|R
5000|$|A modern 33 head stamper <b>battery,</b> {{capable of}} <b>crushing</b> 100 tons a day, was {{installed}} at Rocky Bluff immediately on {{completion of the}} line. The battery was known as [...] "Shaking Moses" [...] and was formally opened in May 1903. The tramline finished {{at the top of}} a steep incline above the battery. All firewood for the boilers and ore for treatment at the battery were lowered down the inclined tramway with two tracks for a distance of about 600 ft. Brake control on the trucks was exercised from a platform at the top of the inclined tramway.|$|R
5000|$|By 1897 {{the battery}} was {{described}} in The North Queensland Register as having 20 head of stamps, 80 berdans, one wheeler, four settlers, three buddles, all driven by a 30h.p. engine. By this period the mill was owned by Messrs Whitehead, D. Rolleston and J. Tilley and managed by Mr J. Barrett. It was one of seventeen then operating on the Charters Towers gold field. (The term [...] "mill" [...] was commonly used on the Charters Towers gold field {{in the nineteenth century}} to refer to a stamper or <b>crushing</b> <b>battery,</b> and later the term included all the concentrating and processing works at the place.) ...|$|R
50|$|By mid 1877 Kingston (later Kingsborough) had a {{population}} of 1,100, with 8 general stores, 2 butchers, and 12 public houses. There was a lemonade factory, chemist, baker, auctioneer, assayer, blacksmith, newsagents, and brickworks {{as well as the}} Vulcan <b>crushing</b> <b>battery.</b> A small dam was built across the Caledonia Creek to ensure water supplies for the steam-powered crushing machinery. The town was surveyed on 1 May 1880. By 1886 the population of Kingsborough had declined to 50 (by 1901 the Mining Warden estimated the entire population of the Hodgkinson Goldfield to be 960). The Vulcan battery was purchased by the Tyrconnel Gold Mining Company in 1884 and relocated to Sam the Roman's camp in 1895.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1880, the Meakin {{brothers}} {{constructed the}} first homestead on the site. In 1887, Wodonga {{was transferred to}} Catherine Ellen Hillcoat, wife of John William Hillcoat, manager of Hope <b>Crushing</b> <b>Battery</b> at nearby Black Snake Mineral Field. Hillcoat's son Harold and his wife settled on the property and raised their family of five boys and four girls. The Hillcoats continued the practice of cheese making and dairying and the family lived in the original homestead until 1902, when they constructed the current homestead. The first stage comprised four rooms with a shingle roof. Pine floorboards were brought from the Gympie sawmill in exchange for pine logs from Wodonga. Two rooms were later added and the roof was extended and clad in corrugated iron.|$|R
50|$|The Talisman, Crown and Woodstock {{stamping}} battery {{remains at}} the lower end of the gorge are some of the most significant reminders of the time. Their location at the confluence of the Waitawheta River and the Ohinemuri River was chosen to make use of the available water power of the rivers. Mining at the batteries occurred roughly from the 1880s to 1950s, with the most productive years around the turn of the century, when the area produced 60 percent of the total gold from New Zealand. The <b>batteries</b> used to <b>crush</b> the ore from the extensive tunnels mined through the steep local mountainsides of the Waitawheta Gorge, with the Victoria Battery one of the largest and most advanced at the time.|$|R
50|$|In 1880 the Great Northern tin lode was {{discovered}} in the Herberton area and prominent businessman, John Moffat, and his company, the Glen Smelting Company, soon secured a monopoly over mining and reduction works in the area. Moffat arrived in Queensland from Scotland in 1862, where he soon opened his own business, from which grew his empire. Whilst Moffat was overseas in 1883, his partner, George Young, bought mines {{in what was then}} Gibb's Camp, in the Herberton district. Gibb's Camp was renamed Irvinebank after Moffat's birthplace in Scotland, and the Loudoun Mill, comprising a five headed <b>crushing</b> <b>battery</b> and tin smelter, was opened there on December 10, 1884. Moffat envisaged Irvinebank as a major industrial region of the Atherton Tablelands, and established both his business interests and his home (Loudoun House) in the town.|$|R
50|$|Further work {{carried out}} between 1912 and 1916 {{under the name}} Richmond Amalgamated saw the {{production}} of 883 tons of ore yielding 3,696 ounces of gold. This {{appears to have been}} the last major production period. The present battery was erected in 1913, with the assistance of a Queensland Government loan under the Mining Machinery Advances Act of 1906. The stamps and shed came from the Highland Mary mine in Croydon and the mill engine from the yard of the local foundry, Stuart and McKenzies. The year 1913 is inscribed on the concrete footings. The <b>battery</b> also <b>crushed</b> for the public, including nearby tin mines, for which it installed Wilfley concentrating tables. By 1915 the mine's engine house featured a forge and a portable engine driving the winding engine, which was used to bail water by tank as well as raise ore. The mill shed housed a 5 stamp battery with a self feeder, engine, amalgamating table, berdan pan, two Wilfley tables, and a pump bringing in water from a dam at the rear. The boiler for the pump and engine was large and situated beside the mill shed. The mill in that year gained some notoriety when on 2 November, Albert Chambers was caught up in the drive belt for the Wilfley table and killed.|$|R
50|$|Currently, the Eureka Council, {{through their}} Victorian Representative, {{is working with}} the Hepburn Shire Council http://www.hepburn.vic.gov.au on several gold history related projects. The Hepburn Shire Council {{encompasses}} the area to the north of Ballarat including the towns of Creswick, Clunes, Daylesford and Trentham. All these towns have a rich gold history with Clunes, Victoria taking the claim of being the place where gold was first discovered in Victoria. The projects involve such initiatives as storyboards at the New Australasian Mine No. 2 shaft, the scene of Australia's worst gold mining accident where in early December 1882, 22 men lost their lives when water broke through to where they were working from an adjacent mine. Other projects include creating a gold trail linking Geelong, Ballarat, Creswick, Clunes and Bendigo, as well as restoring the quartz <b>crushing</b> <b>battery</b> in Creswick.|$|R
50|$|Langlands {{was well}} known for its gold mining equipment, being the first company in Victoria {{to take up the}} {{manufacture}} of mining machinery, and it {{played an important role in}} equipping Victoria's and Australia's first mineral boom in the 1850s and '60s. The company's products including stamper <b>batteries</b> and ore <b>crushing</b> mills, which could found distributed over Australasia from Charters Towers to the Thames goldfields of New Zealand. The first stamp mills made in Australia were manufactured by Langlands, who devised the first stamper system based on the principle of the stamp and shank being rotated by the lifting cam, thus equalizing the wear on the stamp. Up to that time the shanks were square and did not rotate. While this was an invention of Fulton, hedid not patent the idea, and so it was quickly copied all over the world.|$|R
50|$|Ebagoola Township Site, {{established}} in 1900, is significant in demonstrating {{the evolution of}} mining settlements on the remote Cape York Peninsula. After a decade of activity the population dwindled and dwellings were removed, leaving the street alignments and allotments identified by plantings of mangoes and date palms, which are significant in marking the township site today. The combination of the Ada Stewart Battery, remnant workings (both reef and alluvial) and nearby Ebagoola Township Site is important in demonstrating {{the development of the}} Hamilton Goldfield, and of small scale but intensive gold mining activity in far north Queensland, in the early 1900s. The Ada Stewart Battery at Ebagoola is significant because it demonstrates the need for reliable <b>crushing</b> <b>batteries</b> on remote goldfields to enable mining to proceed. Its presence on the Hamilton field also demonstrates a typical pattern of moving plant from field to field in response to new economic opportunities, in this case from Coen to Ebagoola.|$|R

This paper deals with the reclamation of mercury from the used silver oxide quartz wristwatch batteries em-ploying leaching-cementation technique. The used <b>batteries</b> are first <b>crushed</b> to liberate the encapsulated active material from the case which is leached in nitric acid to bring all metal contents into solution. After the removal of silver in the solution as silver chloride by precipitation, the mercury which is present as Hg 2 + in the solution has been reclaimed through cementation with zinc dust. Various effects like zinc sheet and dust, zinc quantity, pH of the solution, duration and temperature have been carried out to standardise the conditions for maximum mercury reclamation. At a temperature of 45 ˚C and at 3. 9 pH, 92. 3 % of mercury was recovered using 74 µm size zinc dust with purity greater than 99. 78 % and the same is characterized by XRF and the results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behaviors of}} LiFePO 4 battery cell and module specimens under in-plane constrained compression were investigated for simulations of battery cells, modules and packs under crush conditions. The experimental stress-strain curves were correlated to the deformation patterns of battery cell and module specimens. Analytical solutions {{were developed to}} estimate the buckling stresses {{and to provide a}} theoretical basis for future design of representative volume element cell and module specimens. A physical kinematics model for formation of kinks and shear bands in battery cells was developed to explain the deformation mechanism for layered battery cells under in-plane constrained compression. A small-scale module constrained punch indentation test was also conducted to benchmark the computational results. The computational results indicate that macro homogenized material models can be used to simulate <b>battery</b> modules under <b>crush</b> conditions. Fatigue behavior and failure modes of ultrasonic spot welds in lap-shear specimens of magnesium and steel sheets with and without adhesive were investigated. For ultrasonic spot welded lap-shear specimens, the failure mode changes from the partial nugget pullout mode under low-cycle loading conditions to the kinked crack failure mode under high-cycle loading conditions. For adhesive-bonded and weld-bonded lap-shear specimens, the test results show the near interface cohesive failure mode and the kinked crack failure mode under low-cycle and high-cycle loading conditions, respectively. Next, the analytical effective stress intensity factor solutions for main cracks in lap-shear specimens of three dissimilar sheets under plane strain conditions were developed and the solutions agreed well with the computational results. The analytical effective stress intensity factor solutions for kinked cracks were compared with the computational results at small kink lengths. The results indicate that the computational results approach to the analytical solutions as the kink length decreases to a small value. Finally, the analytical stress intensity factor solutions for welds in lap-shear specimens of two dissimilar sheets were presented graphically and validated by finite element analyses for convenient fracture and fatigue analyses. The transition thickness ratios and weld widths for different combinations of dissimilar materials were also presented. Experimental results were presented to demonstrate the usefulness of the solutions for predicting failure locations...|$|R
