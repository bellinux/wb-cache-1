5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. <b>Breast</b> <b>feeding</b> decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that <b>breast</b> <b>feeding</b> be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world <b>breast</b> <b>feeding</b> may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E

5|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between homosexual and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence {{of breast cancer}} in lesbians. It has been determined, however, that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears {{makes it more difficult}} to detect cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians. The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, <b>breast</b> <b>feeding,</b> and miscarriages.|$|E

5|$|The cooling {{properties}} of the leaves were used in Britain {{as a treatment for}} trench foot in World War I, and as compresses for ulcers and breast abscesses. Accumulated scientific evidence corroborates that cabbage leaf treatment can reduce the pain and hardness of engorged breasts, and increase the duration of <b>breast</b> <b>feeding.</b> Other medicinal uses recorded in European folk medicine include treatments for rheumatism, sore throat, hoarseness, colic, and melancholy. In the United States, cabbage {{has been used as a}} hangover cure, to treat abscesses, to prevent sunstroke, or to cool body parts affected by fevers. The leaves have also been used to soothe sore feet and, when tied around a child's neck, to relieve croup. Both mashed cabbage and cabbage juice have been used in poultices to remove boils and treat warts, pneumonia, appendicitis, and ulcers.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{begins in}} 85% of cases as a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) {{over a number}} of days with 45% having motor or sensory problems, 20% having optic neuritis, and 10% having symptoms related to brainstem dysfunction, while the remaining 25% have more than one of the previous difficulties. The course of symptoms occurs in two main patterns initially: either as episodes of sudden worsening that last a few days to months (called relapses, exacerbations, bouts, attacks, or flare-ups) followed by improvement (85% of cases) or as a gradual worsening over time without periods of recovery (10–15% of cases). A combination of these two patterns may also occur or people may start in a relapsing and remitting course that then becomes progressive later on. Relapses are usually not predictable, occurring without warning. Exacerbations rarely occur more frequently than twice per year. Some relapses, however, are preceded by common triggers and they occur more frequently during spring and summer. Similarly, viral infections such as the common cold, influenza, or gastroenteritis increase their risk. Stress may also trigger an attack. Women with MS who become pregnant experience fewer relapses; however, during the first months after delivery the risk increases. Overall, pregnancy does not seem to influence long-term disability. Many events have been found not to affect relapse rates including vaccination, <b>breast</b> <b>feeding,</b> physical trauma, and Uhthoff's phenomenon.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} effects of {{maternal}} diet during lactation and the use of formula feeds on the development of atopic eczema in infants at risk. DESIGN [...] Mothers who planned to <b>breast</b> <b>feed</b> exclusively were randomly allocated to either a restricted diet (avoiding milk and other dairy products, eggs, fish, peanuts, and soybeans) or a diet without restrictions. Mothers who did not plan to <b>breast</b> <b>feed</b> were randomly allocated to using one of three formula feeds. SETTING [...] Child health centre in Canada. SUBJECTS [...] 97 Mothers who chose to <b>breast</b> <b>feed</b> and 124 mothers who did not. INTERVENTIONS [...] Restricted diet for 49 mothers who breast fed. Casein hydrolysate formula, soy milk formula, or cows' milk formula for infants not breast fed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Development of eczema in babies. RESULTS [...] Infants were followed up over 18 months and examined for eczema. Eczema was less common and milder in babies who were breast fed and whose mothers were on a restricted diet (11 / 49 (22 %) v 21 / 48 (48 %)). In infants fed casein hydrolysate, soy milk, or cows' milk 9 / 43 (21 %), 26 / 41 (63 %), and 28 / 40 (70 %), respectively, developed atopic eczema.

40|$|Copyright © 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. BACKGROUND: Preterm infants start milk feeds {{by gavage}} tube. As they mature, sucking feeds are {{gradually}} introduced. Women {{who choose to}} <b>breast</b> <b>feed</b> their preterm infant are not always available and an alternative approach to feeding is needed. Most commonly, milk (expressed breast milk or formula) is given by bottle. There is some controversy about whether using bottles during the establishment of <b>breast</b> <b>feeds</b> is detrimental to breastfeeding success. OBJECTIVES: To {{determine the effect of}} avoidance of bottle feeds during the establishment of breastfeeding on the likelihood of successful breastfeeding and to determine if alternatives to bottle feeds are safe. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE in any language. The search was updated in July 2008. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi randomised controlled trials comparing avoidance of bottles with use of bottles in women who have chosen to <b>breast</b> <b>feed</b> their preterm infant. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When appropriate, we contacted study authors for additional information. Standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used. MAIN RESULTS: Five trials of 543 infants were included. Four trials used a cup feeding strategy and one trial used a tube feeding strategy when supplements to <b>breast</b> <b>feeds</b> were needed. The single study of tube feeding had a high risk of bias. In the analysis of all five trials, significant heterogeneity was evident in two of the primary outcomes. This was reduced when the tube feeding trial was removed from analyses. Cup feeding significantly decreased 'no breastfeeding or only partial breast feeding' on discharge home (summary RR 0. 75, 95 % CI 0. 61 to 0. 91). However, cup feeding significantly increased length of hospital stay by 10 days (95 % CI 3. 87 to 16. 29). There was a high degree of noncompliance in the largest study of cup feeding indicating dissatisfaction with this method by staff and/or parents. The one trial of a tube alone approach significantly reduced 'no breastfeeding or only partial breastfeeding' and 'no breastfeeding at all' at all time periods but the results need to be interpreted with caution due to the high risk of bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Supplementing <b>breast</b> <b>feeds</b> by cup confers no breastfeeding benefit beyond discharge home and delays discharge considerably. There is currently insufficient evidence on which to base recommendations for a tube alone approach to supplementing <b>breast</b> <b>feeds.</b> Further research is needed to evaluate a tube alone approach.
