25|$|This <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> to Wittgenstein's {{reliance}} on indirect communication, and his {{reliance on}} thought-experiments. Some philosophical confusions come about because we aren't {{able to see}} family resemblances. We've {{made a mistake in}} understanding the vague and intuitive rules that language uses, and have thereby tied ourselves up in philosophical knots. He suggests that an attempt to untangle these knots requires more than simple deductive arguments pointing out the problems with some particular position. Instead, Wittgenstein's larger goal is to try to divert us from our philosophical problems long enough to become aware of our intuitive ability to see the family resemblances.|$|E
500|$|The Age of Plastic {{starts with}} the title track [...] "The Plastic Age," [...] which, {{according}} to Downes, is about a person's view of plastic experiences from watching and reading news reports on the Vietnam War. [...] "Video Killed the Radio Star," [...] the second track, refers to a period of technological change in the 1960s, the desire to remember {{the past and the}} disappointment that children of the current generation would not appreciate the past. The fast-paced third song, [...] "Kid Dynamo," [...] is about the effects of media on a futuristic kid of the 1980s. [...] "I Love You (Miss Robot)" [...] is the album's fourth track, that Downes said it talks about [...] "being on the road and making love to someone you don't really like, while all the time you're wanting to phone someone who's a long way off." [...] Wave Maker Magazine viewed the song as [...] "a darkly soothing, bass guitar-driven ballad which <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> into cyberpunk country." ...|$|E
500|$|The pilot episode {{received}} acclaim {{from television}} critics. TV Guide's Matt Roush praised {{the marriage of}} Scorsese and Winter, saying it [...] "... brilliantly marries Martin Scorsese's virtuosic cinematic eye to Terence Winter's panoramic mastery of rich character and eventful story," [...] and finished his review by stating [...] "It's the most purely—and impurely—enjoyable storytelling HBO has delivered in ages, like a movie that {{you never want to}} end." [...] Variety's Brian Lowry praised the show for returning network HBO to top form, saying [...] "This is, quite simply, television at its finest, occupying a sweet spot that—for all the able competition—still remains unique to HBO: An expensive, explicit, character-driven program, tackling material no broadcast network or movie studio would dare touch... For those wondering when the channel would deliver another franchise to definitively put it on top of the world, Ma, the wait is over: Go directly to [...] "Boardwalk."" [...] "One of the unexpected joys of [...] "Boardwalk Empire," [...] though, lies in the way the show revels in the oddities of its time, peeling back the layers of polite society to reveal a giddy shadow world of criminals and politicians collaborating to keep the liquor flowing," [...] says online magazine Salon's Heather Havrilesky who went on to call the pilot [...] "breathtaking." [...] Roberto Bianco from USA Today said in his review that Boardwalk Empire was [...] "Extravagantly produced, shockingly violent and as cold and hard as ice, Boardwalk Empire <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> to the world's former playground at the start of Prohibition—and brings HBO back to the forefront of the TV-series race." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{would have}} been strange indeed if John Marrot could have been much put about by a small matrimonial breeze, seeing that his life was spent in riding on an iron monster with {{white-hot}} lungs and boiling bowels which carried him through space day and night {{at the rate of}} fifty miles an hour!

"We are here," [...] said Maxwell, laying {{his finger}} on the paper, [...] "on the {{threshold}} of what the niggers call the Leopards' country, which is marked as partly explored territory, with this patch to represent the dominions of King, or headman, Shaillu. A few armed expeditions have traversed it farther east, and found it thinly peopled by petty tribes hostile to Europeans, while nobody knows much about Shaillu except that he abruptly broke off the negotiations he once began with the authorities.

6000|$|The {{belief that}} the sun will rise to-morrow might be falsified if the earth came {{suddenly}} into contact with a large body which destroyed its rotation; but the laws of motion and the law of gravitation would not be infringed by such an event.

In this search science has been remarkably successful, {{and it may be}} conceded that such uniformities have held hitherto.
