5|$|Blood free {{thyroxine}} and TSH {{levels are}} monitored {{to help determine}} whether the dose is adequate.

In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before <b>breakfast,</b> <b>or</b> four hours after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine.
