25|$|The {{position}} at right occurred in Gelfand–Kramnik, 1994 FIDE Candidates match, game 6, in Sanghi Nagar, India. Vladimir Kramnik (Black), down two pawns {{and on the}} defensive, would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> with a draw. Boris Gelfand (White) has just played 67. Re4–e7?, a strong-looking move that threatens 68.Qxf6, winning a third pawn, or 68.Rc7, further constricting Black. Black responded 67... Qc1! If White takes Black's undefended rook with 68.Qxd8, Black's desperado queen forces the draw with 68...Qh1+ 69.Kg3 Qh2+!, compelling 70.Kxh2 stalemate (second diagram). If White avoids the stalemate with 68.Rxg7+ Kxg7 69.Qxd8, Black draws by perpetual check with 69...Qh1+ 70.Kg3 Qg1+ 71.Kf4 Qc1+! 72.Ke4 Qc6+! 73.Kd3!? (73.d5 Qc4+; 73.Qd5 Qc2+) Qxf3+! 74.Kd2 Qg2+! 75.Kc3 Qc6+ 76.Kb4 Qb5+ 77.Ka3 Qd3+. Gelfand played 68. d5 instead, but still only drew.|$|E

Washington promptly promised support for the new regime even before Khánh had formed a government. At the same time, {{despite the fact that}} many senior members of Minh's junta were in custody, the Americans said that no change in power had occurred and that a fresh diplomatic recognition was not needed. Lodge claimed that Khánh's actions were merely a leadership change {{at the top of the}} MRC.|$|E

Following two incidents during the race, Max Verstappen was given time penalties and three penalty points on his FIA Super Licence – one for overtaking Jenson Button outside track limits and two for ignoring blue flags while Lewis Hamilton tried to lap him. The penalties meant that he was just four points away from a one-race ban.|$|E
500|$|In March 2010, Nesbitt {{accepted}} the ceremonial position of Chancellor of the University of Ulster, succeeding former Lord Mayor of London Sir Richard Nichols.

500|$|Mason and Washington {{were friends}} {{for many years}} until they finally broke over their {{differences}} regarding the federal constitution. Peter R. Henriques, in his journal article on their relationship, suggested that Mason cultivated the friendship more than Washington did, as Mason sent many more letters and gifts, and stayed more often at Washington's plantation, though the last can be explained in part as Mount Vernon lay on the road from Gunston Hall to Alexandria. Henriques suggested that as Mason was older, intellectually superior, {{and the owner of}} a flourishing plantation as Washington struggled to establish Mount Vernon, {{it would not have been}} in the future president's character to be close to Mason. Washington had a deep respect for Mason's intellectual abilities, several times asking for his advice, and writing in 1777 when learning that Mason had taken charge of an issue before the General Assembly, [...] "I know of no person better qualified... than Colonel Mason, and shall <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> to hear he has taken it in hand".|$|E

I've been doing this what I'm doing now for one year and I'd {{like to see what}} it's like to do it for longer. I don't think anyone is pushing for a reunion either. Nobody ever brings it up in any seriousness – I mean Liam does publicly but he says a lot of things publicly. I wouldn't take anything he says seriously". After their performance of Wonderwall at the London Olympics Closing Ceremony (which Gallagher had originally turned down), he referred to Liam's band Beady Eye as 'Stratford's finest Oasis tribute band'.|$|E
500|$|Reilly further {{added that}} the renewal was also {{prompted}} by the high risk of trying to replace Fringe with another show with unknown viewership metrics; he commented that they [...] "have a far better shot of sticking with a show that has an audience that [...] think [...] can grow". Prior to {{the onset of the}} fourth season, Reilly reiterated that they do not expect any significant growth in Fringes viewership within that season: [...] "It’s a pretty complex show. If Fringe can do exactly what Fringe did last year, we’re going to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy.</b> They’re right in the pocket creatively once again." [...] Wyman stated in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that the Fox network had been [...] "supportive throughout this process", and though the show's viewership [...] "wasn't exactly what they would've hoped for", aspects such as a loyal fan base and supportive critics were enough to take the show forward for another season. Pinkner commented that [...] "there were no creative conditions" [...] on the show's renewal, nor any cuts in the show's budget, though was unsure if the show will be moved to a different time slot. Noble, at the 2011 Comic-Con Fringe panel, reiterated that the fans were responsible for the livelihood of the show, stated, [...] "Seriously, without your efforts, your rabid support, we wouldn’t be here right now. You are the best fans that ever existed". The fourth season premiered on September 23, 2011.|$|E
500|$|Atwell had stated on {{potential}} further seasons, [...] "We {{think that there}} could be more to come....the [...] finale doesn't suggest that that's it and they live happily ever after; that's the end.

[...] On the location for a third season, Fazekas stated that moving the series to London had been a possibility, an idea that creators Markus and McFeely had early on. Fazekas added, [...] "you can put the show anywhere, because it's spies. [...] all going to be determined by what story we want to tell. I loved [...] I loved how it looked, I loved how it looked on Peggy. We would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> to do another L.A. season, but we're not married to it." [...] Fazekas also said that seeds for a third season had been planted all throughout the second, and {{that the end of the}} second season, with someone shooting Thompson and taking the M. Carter file, was [...] "very much tied to a third season arc", with the shooter and their reason for taking the file already determined. Atwell added that the third season would have gone [...] "further back into [...] past” while having [...] "a possible kind of twist... into something to do with [...] family." [...] She also added that more insight would have been provided on Carter's brother, Michael.|$|E
