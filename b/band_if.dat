25|$|A typical {{season with}} the OSUMB runs from June until January. Starting in June, the band runs Summer Sessions to train and teach {{prospective}} and returning band members. In July, the band performs a joint concert with the Columbus Symphony Orchestra. This event is typically performed with 1/2 to 3/4 of the full band, and often accepts volunteers who did not march the previous season. In August, the schedule becomes highly packed. There are often small pep band events throughout Columbus, at OSU's Regional Campuses across the state, {{as well as on}} the Columbus Campus. The band performs at all home football games, at an NFL game (either Cincinnati Bengals or Cleveland Browns), and at least one or two away games. In 2013, the band performed at four away games, a first for the <b>band.</b> <b>If</b> the football team is eligible for post-season play, the band will travel to those games as well. On away trips, there is almost always an Ohio State rally, put on by the local chapter of the OSU Alumni Association. This rally features guest speakers, the band, and cheerleaders. For trips to the University of Michigan or Michigan State University, the band performs a sit-down concert in the Toledo, Ohio area. There are additional full-band performances such as the Homecoming Parade, Circleville Pumpkin Show Parade, and two big concerts: one in an often remote part of Ohio, and the annual concert in Columbus at Value City Arena (previously held at Veterans Memorial before its demolition during the 2014 season).|$|E

The members of Fall Out Boy cite The Get Up Kids' influence, particularly their album Four Minute Mile. In a 2005 interview with Alternative Press, Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz stated that the band had a huge influence on him and the other members of Fall Out Boy. [...] "There should be a How To Be a Pop-Punk Kid starter kit with bands like Get Up Kids, so kids would know whose shoulders bands like us are standing on.

500|$|Lyricist {{and lead}} singer Tim Lambesis has given mixed {{commentary}} on the subject: when asked in 2008 if the members were [...] "a Christian band" [...] or [...] "Christians in a band", Lambesis stated on the band's FAQ, [...] "I'm {{not sure what the}} difference is between five Christians playing in a band and a Christian <b>band,</b> <b>If</b> you truly believe something, then it should affect every area of your life. All five of us are Christians. I believe that change should start with me first, and as a result, our lyrics do not come across very 'preachy.' Many of our songs are about life, struggles, mistakes, relationships and other issues that don't fit entirely in the spiritual category. However, all of these topics are written about through my perspective as a Christian." [...] Furthermore, during an August 2010 radio interview on the Christian metal radio show The Full Armor of God Broadcast, Lambesis stated [...] "I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics." ...|$|E

500|$|Realizing {{that the}} {{arguments}} were only consuming time, RCA relented {{for the time}} being and allowed the band to make studio arrangements. In December 2007, the band made their first attempt at recording the album with producer Matt Bayles, who after only a few days was dismissed as he [...] "wasn't really the right fit". In 2008, after the band spent the winter looking for another producer, their A representative at RCA Records tried to schedule sessions with Tool guitarist Adam Jones but was unsuccessful; as a result, the process did not begin in earnest for six more months. This also meant they could not plan a concert tour until they had the problems with their studio schedule resolved. Following several more attempts at securing a producer, Priestess finally got the recording sessions scheduled for October 2008 when David Schiffman signed on to the project after meeting with the group through their A representative; Schiffman, whose résumé included artists from Johnny Cash to System of a Down, had expressed interest in helming the album for the <b>band</b> <b>if</b> they were in need of his services. After extensive pre-production in Montreal, Priestess went to Los Angeles to record the album.|$|E

After the performance by the band on MTV on August 8, 2011, the album version premiered on the channel's official website. The song was digitally released on August 9, 2011 exclusively on the iTunes Store, and to all other digital retailers on August 16. In the United Kingdom, the song was released on August 21, and a CD single of the song was released on September 9, 2011 in Germany. The band revealed during an interview {{that there were a lot}} of songs they were planning to release as the album's first single, but it was a [...] "natural choice" [...] to release [...] "What You Want".

500|$|In August 1996, {{the band}} {{performed}} two concerts before crowds of 250,000 at Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, while more than 2,500,000 fans had applied for tickets. The dates {{were to be}} the zenith of Oasis's popularity, and both the music press and the band realised {{it would not be}} possible for the band to equal the event. By this time however, there was much instability and internal conflict emerging between the band members. On 23 August 1996, vocalist Liam Gallagher refused to sing for an MTV Unplugged performance at London's Royal Festival Hall, pleading a sore throat. Though he did attend the concert, he spent the evening heckling Noel from the upper level balcony. Four days later, Liam declined to participate in the first leg of an American tour, complaining that he needed to buy a house with his then girlfriend Patsy Kensit. He re-joined the band a few days after for a key concert at the MTV Video Music Awards in New York, but intentionally sang off-key and spat beer and saliva during the performance. The following day, The Sun led with the front page headline [...] "America sickened by obscene Liam's spitting rampage." [...] Amongst much internal bickering, the tour continued—with Liam—to Charlotte, North Carolina, where Noel finally lost his patience with his brother and announced he was leaving the band. He later admitted [...] "If the truth be known, I didn't want to be there anyway. I wasn't prepared to be in the <b>band</b> <b>if</b> people were being like that to each other." ...|$|E

500|$|While widely {{considered}} to be a pop punk band, Fall Out Boy has also been described as pop rock emo, and emo pop, and cites emo group The Get Up Kids as an influence among many other bands. When interviewed for a retrospective article in Alternative Press at the time The Get Up Kids disbanded in 2005, Pete Wentz stated that [...] "Fall Out Boy would not be a <b>band</b> <b>if</b> it were not for The Get Up Kids." [...] Early in the band's career, when Jared Logan was producing the group's debut album, he asked bassist Pete Wentz what sound the band desired for recording. Wentz responded by [...] "handing over the first two New Found Glory records". Wentz also cites Green Day, the Ramones, Screeching Weasel, Metallica, Earth Crisis, Gorilla Biscuits and Lifetime as influences. The band acknowledges its hardcore punk roots as an influence; all four members were involved in the Chicago hardcore scene before joining Fall Out Boy. Wentz described the band's affiliation with the genre by saying [...] "I think {{the interesting thing is that}} we are all hardcore kids that are writing pop music...It gives us a different style because at our core we are always hardcore. That aspect is always going to be evident in the music. We are hardcore kids that couldn't quite cut it as hardcore kids." [...] He referred to Fall Out Boy's genre as [...] "softcore": hardcore punk mixed with pop sensibility. Lead singer Patrick Stump, however, is also influenced by artists he listened to while growing up including Prince, Michael Jackson, and David Bowie.|$|E
500|$|Andy Kellman of AllMusic {{selected}} the song {{as one of}} the album's highlights, noting that it has [...] "a wide theatrical scope akin to that of The-Dream's own 'Nikki, Pt. 2/Abyss.'" [...] He further analysed: [...] "Over a swelling and receding production with echoes of Kim Carnes' 'Bette Davis Eyes,' Rihanna mourns ("Felt like love struck me in the night/I pray that love don't strike twice"), then confesses ("Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change"), then surrenders ("I'm prepared to die in the moment"). Perhaps no one should read anything into it." [...] Christina Lee of Idolator observed that the song [...] "casts out the album’s most heartbreaking line — 'I’m prepared to die at the moment' — but puts it in a context that doesn’t explain enough." [...] Esquires Miles Raymer thought that Police would have been a better <b>band</b> <b>if</b> they would have had Rihanna as their lead singer instead of Sting; however, he described [...] "Mother Mary" [...] as something to skip. Alike Raymer, Bernard Perusse for The Montreal Gazette felt that only [...] "Love Without Tragedy" [...] was worth listening to and described it as demonstrating [...] "a tiny bit of hope" [...] on the album. In a review of the album, Jessica Hopper of Pitchfork Media wrote that [...] "Rihanna sings a grim rhetorical: [...] "What's love without tragedy?" [...] However, according to her the real question that she and her songwriters is presenting on the record is [...] "Who is Rihanna without Chris Brown?" [...] "Nathan Slavick for DJ Booth was critical of the tracks theme, writing that [...] "Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary", along with [...] "Stay" [...] and [...] "No Love Allowed", all discuss the topic of Rihanna being a non-controversial person who is struggling to find love in a [...] "mad world". He further wrote that none of them are impressive." ...|$|E
