5|$|The civil {{leadership}} of the resistance, represented by lawyer Sven Arntzen, demanded Quisling <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> any other murder suspect and, on 9 May, Quisling and his ministers turned themselves in to police. Quisling was transferred to Cell 12 in Møllergata 19, the main police station in Oslo. The cell was equipped with a tiny table, a basin, and {{a hole in the}} wall for a toilet bucket.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E
25|$|The biblical {{requirement}} {{is that the}} Jubilee year was to <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> a Sabbatical year, with the land lying fallow, but also required the compulsory return of all property to its original owners or their heirs, except the houses of laymen within walled cities, {{in addition to the}} manumission of all Israelite indentured servants.|$|E

25|$|Younis {{had been}} demoted from A {{category}} contract to B category contract by Pakistan Cricket Board. This sparked a media controversy as analysts, former players and cricket fans expressed outrage against the decision with many stating that a player of Younis' stature does {{not deserve to}} <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> this. Eventually the Board gave in to the pressure and Younis was promoted back to A category.|$|E
25|$|However, as {{patients}} with tumors containing mixtures of histological subtypes are usually excluded from clinical trials, {{the properties of}} multiphasic tumors like c-SCLC are much less well understood than those of monophasic tumors. C-SCLC contains both SCLC and NSCLC by definition, and since patients with SCLC and NSCLC are usually treated differently, the lack of good data on c-SCLC means {{there is little evidence}} available with which to form consensus about whether c-SCLC should <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> SCLC, NSCLC, or uniquely.|$|E
25|$|As {{discussed}} earlier, momentary attractions (or repulsions) between particles have {{an effect}} on gas dynamics. In physical chemistry, the name given to these intermolecular forces is van der Waals force. These forces {{play a key role in}} determining physical properties of a gas such as viscosity and flow rate (see physical characteristics section). Ignoring these forces in certain conditions (see Kinetic-molecular theory) allows a real gas to <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> an ideal gas. This assumption allows the use of ideal gas laws which greatly simplifies calculations.|$|E

25|$|At {{about the}} same time, {{international}} law came to recognize the analogous concept of hostes humani generis ("enemies of the human race"): pirates, hijackers, and similar outlaws whose crimes were typically committed outside the territory of any state. The notion that heads of state and senior public officials should <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> pirates or outlaws before the global bar of justice is, according to Henry Kissinger, a new gloss on this old concept. From these premises, representing the Enlightenment belief in trans-territorial, trans-cultural standards of right and wrong, derives universal jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|The {{spectrum}} {{property rights}} model advocates that the spectrum resources should <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> land, i.e. private ownership of spectrum portions should be permitted. The allocation of these portions should be implemented {{by means of}} market forces. The spectrum owners {{should be able to}} trade these portions in secondary markets. Alternatively, the spectrum owners would be able to use their bands in any way they want through any technology they prefer (service and technology neutrality). Although the spectrum property rights model advocates exclusive allocation of transmission rights, it {{is not the same as}} a licensed regime. The main difference is the service and technology neutrality advocated in the spectrum property rights approach, as opposed to strict requirements on services and communications technologies inherent in licensed governance regimes.|$|E
25|$|In the Taikang era (280–289), Emperor Wu {{issued an}} {{imperial}} edict to praise Xun Xu for his talents and contributions, {{and said that}} he was capable of assuming greater responsibilities. He then appointed Xun Xu as a Household Counsellor (光祿大夫) to <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> one of the Three Ducal Ministers, as well as allowing Xun Xu to have his own administrative office, in addition to his existing appointments as Supervisor of the Palace Writers (中書監) and Palace Attendant (侍中). Around the time, Jia Chong and Li Yin (李胤) were already dead and the position of Crown Prince's Grand Tutor (太子太傅) was vacant. Xun Xu wrote a memorial to Emperor Wu, nominating Yang Yao (楊珧) to be the Crown Prince's Grand Tutor, and either Wei Guan or Shan Tao to be the new Minister over the Masses. Emperor Wu accepted his suggestions.|$|E

500|$|As Congress debated how the U.S. {{would be}} {{organized}} after the war, {{the status of}} freed slaves and former Confederates remained undetermined. Stevens stated that what was needed was a [...] "radical reorganization of southern institutions, habits, and manners". Stevens, Sumner and other radicals argued that the southern states should <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> conquered provinces, without constitutional rights. Lincoln, on the contrary, said that only individuals, not states, had rebelled. In July 1864, Stevens pushed Lincoln to sign the Wade–Davis Bill, which required {{at least half of}} prewar voters to sign an oath of loyalty for a state to gain readmission. Lincoln, who advocated his more lenient ten percent plan, pocket vetoed it.|$|E

During the performance the singer wore {{a modified version of}} her famous meat dress and sang the song while faux meat carcasses hung around her. Gaga was surrounded by her dancers who were semi-nude onstage. The sequence portrayed a wedding with an extended Spanish guitar intro and Gaga appearing on the meat counter as the bride in the meat dress. It ends with the singer shooting her husband onstage. After finishing the song, Gaga told the audience [...] "In 1970, women would no longer <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> meat.

Puck is still her boyfriend. She appears in [...] "Jagged Little Tapestry" [...] along with Tina to help Becky convince her new boyfriend that she is in every club of the school. Quinn, Tina, Sue, and Coach Roz get a huge surprise when they find out that Becky's boyfriend, Darrell, does not have Down syndrome like Becky does. They all get a big lesson when they confront him and realize that a person with Down syndrome should <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> everyone else. Despite being Santana and Brittany's best friend, she is notably absent during their wedding in [...] "A Wedding". She is mentioned several times during the Pilot's parallel episode [...] "2009", as Finn's cheerleader girlfriend. She is later seen during Don't Stop Believin' watching the performance with Sue and Santana.
