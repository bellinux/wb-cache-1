A veteran of the 2008 Summer Games, she trained for London at the University of Bath, where she {{was a graduate student}} in bioscience. Ranked 102nd in the world, she qualified by being the top player on the African continent. In the women's singles, she lost to Pi Hongyan of France and Chloe Magee of Ireland, finished in the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> group, and was eliminated from the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Anna has {{distinguishable}} {{facial features}} of a typical Disney heroine, including big eyes, thin lips and a small nose. Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has them on her shoulders. Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs on the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress.|$|E
5|$|Virginia then {{proceeded}} to Norfolk, where she coaled before continuing on to Tompkinsville, Staten Island. She then steamed to the New York Navy Yard {{and went into the}} drydock to have the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull painted. The ship returned to the Norfolk Navy Yard for periodic maintenance from 3 November 1906 to 18 February 1907. A fire control device was installed between 19 February and 23 March. Virginia then returned to Cuba, arriving in Guantanamo Bay on 28 March. She conducted gunnery training off Cuba until 10 April, when she departed for Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she remained from 15 April to 15 May. During this period, she participated in the Jamestown Exposition to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the Jamestown colony. An international fleet that included British, French, German, Japanese, and Austro-Hungarian warships joined the US Navy at the event. In mid-May, when she went into the Norfolk Navy Yard for repairs, which lasted into early June. From 7 to 13 June, she took part in a naval review for Roosevelt in Hampton Roads. Target practice followed off Cape Cod Bay from mid-June to mid-July. Virginia and the rest of her division then cruised the east coast, stopping in Newport, New York City, and Provincetown, followed by night battle training in Cape Cod Bay.|$|E
25|$|The {{weight of}} Taihos armor {{immersed}} her hull so deeply that her lower hangar deck was barely above the load waterline and the <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> two elevator wells (which formed the roofs <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{fore and aft}} aviation fuel tanks) were actually below the waterline. This latter fact would {{play an important role}} in her subsequent destruction during the Battle of the Philippine Sea.|$|R
50|$|Rumpology can be {{performed}} either by sight, touch or by using buttock prints. In addition to live readings, Jackie Stallone will perform buttock readings using e-mailed digital photographs, and has claimed to predict the outcome of Presidential elections and Oscar awards by reading the <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> two pet Doberman Pinschers. Ulf Buck claims he can read people's futures by feeling their naked buttocks.|$|R
2500|$|Just {{prior to}} the attack, Knoller was taking the dogs up to the roof; Bane [...] and {{possibly}} Hera [...] attacked Whipple in the hallway. (Hera's role in the mauling has never been firmly established.) Whipple suffered a total of 77 wounds to every part <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body except <b>her</b> scalp and <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> feet. Another neighbor called 911 after hearing Whipple's screams. Whipple died hours later at San Francisco General Hospital from [...] "loss of blood from multiple traumatic injuries (dog bite wounds)".|$|R

5|$|In 1953, editor Hugh Hefner began {{publishing}} Playboy and {{the magazine}} became popular {{because of its}} early Playmates, such as Mansfield, Marilyn Monroe, Bettie Page, and Anita Ekberg. Mansfield posed nude for the February 1955 issue of Playboy, modeling in pajamas raised so that the <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> breasts showed. This increased the magazine's circulation and helped launch Mansfield's career. Beginning in February 1955, she formed a long-standing relationship with Playboy. Shortly afterward, she posed for the Playboy calendar, covering her breasts with her hands. Playboy featured Mansfield every February from 1955 to 1958, and again in 1960.|$|R

500|$|There {{are three}} {{witnesses}} who provide direct evidence supporting {{the idea that}} Park was innocent. The first, a neighbour, claims that they saw Carol at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> driveway. A second, another neighbour, claims that they saw an unidentified man in a Volkswagen Beetle in the Parks' drive for twenty minutes. The presence of the unidentified car has never been accounted for. Around 6pm that night, another witness, a woman who knew Carol, saw her at Charnock Richard services. She had mentioned to her husband the fact that Carol had not greeted her, describing her as [...] "snobby".|$|E
500|$|Because Germany had [...] {{again on}} 1 February, Kroonland was laid up {{for almost two}} months at the American Line piers in New York, along with sister ship Finland and three other vessels. During this forced downtime, Kroonland was {{converted}} from coal burning to oil burning, a long-awaited modification that had been announced in October 1915. The conversion {{reduced the number of}} stokers needed from 75 to 12, lowering Kroonlands payroll. Because fuel oil was stored inside the double <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull, her cargo capacity was increased through the elimination of her coal bunkers. The labor savings and the additional freight revenues from the increased cargo space resulted in a net gain of $25,000 income per trip.|$|E
500|$|Most {{critics were}} not {{impressed}} with the medley, comparing it to Aguilera's identity during the Bionic era. Tamar Anitai, also of MTV Buzzworthy summarized the performance saying it [...] "was all about her [...] "I-I'm-still-a-diva" [...] vocals, frenzied stage show, and adult-only innuendo...And then this happened." [...] She went on to comment also sarcastically, [...] "This is so just Christina Aguilera's way of saying she loves you! And that the diminutive diva still {{has a sense of}} humor....It's like a little knowing wink that assures you that when she's not changing diapers and doing mommy stuff, Mamaguilera's hanging out at dance party sex dungeons and wailing from the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> light-up hoo-ha. She is DEFINITELY not the same girl who once bopped around on the Disney Channel in a Scrunchie." ...|$|E

[...] However, on further appeal, the Virginia Supreme Court returned custody to the grandmother.|$|R
500|$|At 14:05, Yahagi sank, {{the victim}} of twelve bombs and seven torpedoes. At the same time, a final flight of torpedo bombers {{attacked}} Yamato from her starboard side. Her list was now such that the torpedoes—set {{to a depth of}} —struck the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull. The battleship continued her inexorable roll to port. By 14:20, the power went out and her remaining 25mm anti-aircraft guns began to drop into the sea. Three minutes later, Yamato capsized. Her main 46cm turrets fell off, and as she rolled suction was created that drew swimming crewmen back toward the ship. When the roll reached approximately °, one of the two bow magazines detonated in a tremendous explosion. The resulting mushroom cloud—over [...] high—was seen [...] away on Kyūshū. Yamato sank rapidly, losing an estimated 3,055 of her 3,332 crew, including fleet commander Vice-Admiral Seiichi Itō. The few survivors that weren't killed by strafing fighters were recovered by the four surviving destroyers, which withdrew to Japan.|$|E

500|$|Philip Lutgendorf, {{a scholar}} at the University of Iowa, has stated that while {{the theme of the}} {{conflict}} between passionate individual love and family duty may be very common in Hindi film making, with endless cinematic permutations, K. Asif's [...] "excessive elaboration of the theme remains in a class by itself." [...] Further, Emperor Akbar struggles between his personal desires and his duties to the nation. Ashis Nandy noted that apart from the conflict between Akbar and his son, there is also an [...] "unwritten alliance" [...] between Akbar and Bahar that compounds the problems of Anarkali. He also thought it highlighted the [...] "idea of justice and the notion of unconditional love" [...] to uphold tradition. The song [...] "Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya" [...] sung by Anarkali was an indication of her defiance of societal norms. A major difference from the original story is that while the earlier Anarakali films based on Imtiaz Ali Taj's story ended as tragedies, K. Asif created a relatively happy ending in that Akbar gives amnesty to Anarkali by allowing her to escape through a secret route of tunnels below a false <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> prison wall, although his son is made to suffer in believing her to have perished.|$|E
500|$|Due to Manson's growing {{confidence}} and technical skill, the band decided that her vocals {{did not require}} much treatment; [...] "Shirley was singing so much better, and she was coming up with melodies that were longer and had more range to them...there wasn't any point in doing a lot with it. On something like 'Nobody Loves You' she sings really low on the verse, almost at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> range, and then and the end she's singing {{three and a half}} octaves higher, almost in falsetto, as the song turns into a big wall of sound", Vig remarked. Manson's original guide vocals were used in the final mixes of several songs; the vocal on [...] "So Like a Rose" [...] was recorded on the first take. On some songs, however, Manson's vocal was subject to Pro Tools plug-ins and post effects. [...] "Til the Day Die" [...] featured a digital [...] "scratch"-effect, created by printing her vocal to DAT and using whatever edited passes sounded good. On [...] "Can't Cry These Tears", the four vocal parts were triple-tracked using different mikes, while a guitar riff was matched to her voice for a section of [...] "Breaking Up the Girl". On [...] "Cherry Lips", her entire vocal was sped up and heavily EQ'd. On slower songs such as [...] "Drive You Home", Garbage were not overly concerned with phrasing and pitch, giving it [...] "a rawer quality". Manson improved on her guitar skills and played more guitar in the studio and live on stage for the eventual tour.|$|E
500|$|Despite the problems, {{the tour}} was a success, and Lloyd {{performed}} to packed theatres throughout America. Her act featured the songs [...] "The Tiddly Wink", [...] "I'd Like to Live in Paris All the Time (The Coster Girl in Paris)", and [...] "The Aviator". The numbers were popular, {{partly due to}} the Americanisation of each song's lyrics. On a personal level, Lloyd's time in America was miserable and was made worse by the increasing domestic abuse she received from Dillon. [...] The assaults caused her to miss several key performances, which angered the theatre manager, Edward Albee, who threatened her with a breach of contract action. [...] She claimed that illness made it difficult for her to perform and protested at her billing position. The theatrical press were not convinced. The New York Telegraph speculated [...] "In vaudeville circles her domestic relations are thought to be at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> attacks of disposition." [...] Back in England, Hurley had died of pleurisy and pneumonia on 6 December 1913. Lloyd heard the news while appearing in Chicago and sent a wreath with a note saying [...] "until we meet again". [...] She was reported in The Morning Telegraph as saying: [...] "With all due respect to the dead, I can cheerfully say that's the best piece of news I've heard in many years, for it means that Bernard Dillon and I will marry as soon as this unlucky year ends." [...] Lloyd married Dillon on 21 February 1914, [...] the ceremony taking place at the British Consulate in Portland, Oregon. When the tour finished, Lloyd commented, [...] " [...] never forget the humiliation to which I have been subjected and I shall never sing in America again, no matter how high the salary offered." ...|$|E
