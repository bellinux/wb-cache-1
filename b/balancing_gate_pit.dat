40|$|Abstract. <b>Balanced</b> <b>gates</b> are an {{effective}} countermeasure against power analysis attacks {{only if they}} can be guaranteed to maintain their power balance. Traditional testing and reliability methods are used primarily only to ensure the correctness of the logical functionality and not the balance of a circuit. Due to the hardware redundancy in <b>balanced</b> <b>gate</b> designs, there are many faults which can imbalance a <b>balanced</b> <b>gate</b> without causing logical errors. As a result, traditional testing and reliability methods and architectures are unable to test and verify if a gate is completely defect and fault-free and hence balanced. Our simulations show that a few faulty <b>balanced</b> <b>gates</b> can make a circuit as vulnerable to power analysis attacks as a completely imbalanced implementation. This vulnerability opens the possibility of new methods of attacks based on a combination of fault and power attacks. A solution to the vulnerability based on a built-in differential self-balance comparator is presented. ...|$|R

Poor runner design will lead to uneven injection velocity and pressure which affect the size and shape {{and the quality of the}} rubber products.

One of the major obstacles is a <b>balancing</b> of <b>gates</b> and runners in a family mold due to lack of clear understanding of the flow behavior of plastic in the mold resulting in overpacking,short shot or any other defects on the parts. The objective of this research is to to compare mould flow simulation software with actual injection molding and predict possibility of injection molding defect before injection. The aim of our analysis is to provide a simple experimental model simulation was performed. Different sizes of simple geometric parts were selected as a case study for a family mold with two cavities. Mould flow simulation software was employed to analyze the plastic feeding system such as sprues, runners and gates. The simulation results were obtained as a useful guideline for <b>balancing</b> of <b>gate</b> and runner system for a family mold. Consequently,a numerical tool simulating plastic injection processes can assist mold designers to design molds and to optimize the injection processes in order to avoid any defects such as fill time,pressure,pressure at end of fill,volumetric shrinkage,pressure at V/P switchover,temperature at flow front, sink mark index,weld lines and many more before manufacturing the molds.

40|$|A {{protocol}} for delay-insensitive asynchronous communication {{based on the}} time-multiplexing of two bit on a dual rail line is proposed and analyzed. Compared to conventional dual-rail protocols, it halves the number of bus wires and, according to simulations, significantly reduces energy consumption with small throughput loss and nearly no area overhead. 1. Introduction As feature size of CMOS technology decreases, the <b>balance</b> between <b>gate</b> and wire delays is going worse, with wiring delays moving into dominance. The dominant wire delay causes many troubles in synchronous designs: since wire delays depend on the final physical design, the system performance strongly depends on physical implementation, so many design cycles are needed to obtain a correct circuit. Delay-insensitive asynchronous communication can simplify design, reducing sensitivity to circuit delays; nevertheless, conventional delay-insensitive techniques (i. e. dual-rail coding) are expensive in terms of energy [1] [...] ...|$|R

N/PBTI-induced degrada-tion depends heavily on workload, which causes imbalanced degradation and additional clock skew for clock distribution networks with clock gating features. In this work, we first analyze the effects of N/PBTI on clock paths with different clock gating use cases. Then cross-layer solutions are proposed to reduce N/PBTI-induced clock skew. Two Integrated Clock Gating (ICG) cell circuits are proposed to alternate clock idle state between logic high and logic low for each clock gating operation. A skew mitigation methodology is also proposed to select the appropriate ICG cells based on the architecture and microarchitecture context.
