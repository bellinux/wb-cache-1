40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{the bicycle}} {{has become an}} {{environmentally}} friendly transportation. The bicycle {{can be divided into}} mountain bicycle and highway bicycle. Safe driving is the prior consideration. The bicycle braking system can be divided into oil pressure <b>disk</b> <b>brakes</b> and mechanical <b>disk</b> <b>brakes.</b> The <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> system is one indispensable component of the safe system. In accordance to overall weight consideration of the bike, the <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> should also focus on the lightweight design. This paper discussed an innovative <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> forming technology for 6061 aluminum alloy by the rigid-plastic finite element analysis. The simulation parameters include geometric shapes of the <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> and mold, die temperature, and friction factors. The stress and strain in forming, brake deformation and vibration modal analysis of <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> in riding were studied. The paper is expected to offer some precision bicycle <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> manufacture knowledge for industry. 1...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of thermoelastic contact problem of functionally graded (FG) rotating <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> with heat source due to contact friction is presented. Finite element method (FEM) is used. The material properties of disk {{are assumed to}} be represented by power-law distributions in the radial direction. The inner and outer surfaces considered are metal and ceramic, respectively. Pure material is considered for the brake pad. Coulomb contact friction is assumed as the heat source. It is divided into two equal parts between pad and <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> which leads to thermal stresses. Mechanical response of FG disks are compared and verified with the known results from the literatures. The results show that the maximum value of radial displacement in mounted FG <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> is not at outer surface. It is found that the all areas between pad and <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> is in full-contact status when the ratio of pad thickness to <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> thickness is 0. 66. It is observed that the total strain due to thermomechanical load is negative for some parts of the disks, whereas, the thermal strains are always positive. It can be concluded that gradation index of the metal-ceramic has significant effect in the thermomechanical response of FG disks. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Small wind turbines, {{particularly}} self-build designs, {{are widely}} adopting magneto alternators for their generators. These use rotating neodymium rare-earth magnets with a three-phase stator, then a bridge rectifier to produce DC. This is then used either directly for water-pumping, stored in batteries, or {{used to drive}} a mains inverter which can supply the grid system for profit. These designs have been encouraged {{by one of the}} most popular self-build designs, described in Hugh Piggott's series of books and courses. A typical design here is an axial-flux generator recycled from a car <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> and hub bearing. A MacPherson strut provides the azimuth bearing to bring the turbine into the wind.

50|$|Conventional {{ceramics}} {{are very}} sensitive to thermal stress because of their high Young's modulus and low elongation capability. Temperature differences and low thermal conductivity create locally different elongations, which together with the high Young's modulus generate high stress. This results in cracks, rupture and brittle failure. In CMCs, the fibres bridge the cracks, and the components show no macroscopic damage, even if the matrix has cracked locally. The application of CMCs in <b>brake</b> <b>disks</b> demonstrates the effectiveness of ceramic composite materials under extreme thermal shock conditions.|$|E
50|$|Railroads {{have been}} using disk brakes on {{passenger}} cars for more than 60 years, but coupled with a Rolokron anti-lock system to avoid the creation of flat spots (or “square wheels”) when wheels lock and skid on the rail surface (audible as steady bang-bang-bang noise as a train goes by—not {{to be confused with}} the bang-bang...bang-bang....bang-bang sound made by wheels rolling over a rail joint). Usually, <b>brake</b> <b>disks</b> are installed in the center of the axle, but in some applications (such as Bombardier Bi Level commuter cars), only one disk is used, mounted on the axle end outside the truck frame.
