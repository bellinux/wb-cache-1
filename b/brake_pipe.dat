5|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, {{electric}} lighting was provided on both locomotive and footplate, {{powered by a}} steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the ergonomics of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the fireman, a treadle used steam pressure to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the firebox. The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the Merchant Navy class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the main}} {{reservoir}} pipe is kept constantly pressurized by the locomotive, the car reservoirs can be charged independently of the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe,</b> this being accomplished via a check valve to prevent backfeeding into the pipe. This arrangement helps to reduce the above described pressure loss problems, and also reduces the time required for the brakes to release, since the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> only has to recharge itself.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} of a loss of braking due to {{reservoir}} depletion, the engine driver may be able to regain control with an emergency brake application, as the emergency portion of each car's dual-compartment reservoir should be fully chargedit is not affected by normal service reductions. The triple valves detect an emergency reduction based on the rate of <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> pressure reduction. Therefore, as long as a sufficient volume of air can be rapidly vented from the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe,</b> each car's triple valve will cause an emergency brake application. However, if the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> pressure is too low due to an excessive number of brake applications, an emergency application will not produce a large enough volume of air flow to trip the triple valves, leaving the engine driver with no means to stop the train.|$|E

50|$|The driver's {{brake valve}} is a {{complicated}} valve system for controlling the compressed air brake of a railway vehicle. Depending on its setting, it controls whether the <b>brake</b> <b>pipes</b> of a compressed air brake are evacuated and thus whether braking is applied or maintained; or if the <b>brake</b> <b>pipes</b> are connected to a compressed air reservoir, it controls whether the brakes are released again or remain released.|$|R

25|$|Emergency brake connection: The {{computers}} {{are connected to}} the brake via a relay. A computer command or loss of current will release the air from the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> applying the emergency brake.|$|E
25|$|Another {{solution}} to loss of brake pressure is the two-pipe system, fitted on most modern passenger stock and many freight wagons. In {{addition to the}} traditional <b>brake</b> <b>pipe,</b> this enhancement adds the main reservoir pipe, which is continuously charged with air directly from the locomotive's main reservoir. The main reservoir is where the locomotive's air compressor output is stored, and is ultimately the source of compressed air for all systems that use it.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{safeguards}} that are usually taken to prevent this sort of accident happening. Railroads have strict government-approved procedures for testing the air brake systems when making up trains in a yard or picking up cars en route. These generally involve connecting the air brake hoses, charging up the brake system, setting the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are applied, and then releasing the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are released. Particular attention is usually paid to the rearmost car of the train, either by manual inspection or via an automated end-of-train device, to ensure that <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> continuity exists throughout the entire train. When <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> continuity exists throughout the train, failure of the brakes to apply or release on one or more cars is an indication that the cars' triple valves are malfunctioning. Depending on the location of the air test, the repair facilities available, and regulations governing the number of inoperative brakes permitted in a train, the car may be set out for repair or taken to the next terminal where it can be repaired.|$|E
25|$|Air {{brakes on}} the train are {{supplied}} with air from a compressor on each locomotive. When a locomotive is shut off, the compressor no longer supplies the brake system with air. An air <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> connects to each car and locomotive {{on the train}}. When air leaks from the various components, the air pressure drops. If {{the system is not}} recharged with air, the locomotive air brakes will become ineffective and provide no braking force. When the air brake control valves sense a drop in pressure in the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe,</b> they are designed to activate the brakes on each car. However, if the rate of leakage is slow and steady, the automatic brakes may not be applied {{as in the case of}} the Lac-Mégantic accident. The train had locomotives that could automatically restart the air-brake system in the event of a brake failure, provided that these locomotives were not shut down as they would be. Also, the TSB found that the “reset safety control” on the lead locomotive was not wired to set the entire train’s brakes in the event of an engine failure.|$|E
25|$|If the {{pressure}} in the train line is {{lower than that of}} the reservoir, the brake cylinder exhaust portal is closed and air from the car's reservoir is fed into the brake cylinder. Pressure increases in the cylinder, applying the brakes, while decreasing in the reservoir. This action continues until equilibrium between the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> pressure and reservoir pressure is achieved. At that point, the airflow from the reservoir to the brake cylinder is lapped off and the cylinder is maintained at a constant pressure.|$|E
50|$|When a {{locomotive}} is first coupled to a train, or if a vehicle is detached or added, a brake continuity test is carried out, {{to ensure that}} the <b>brake</b> <b>pipes</b> are connected throughout {{the entire length of the}} train.|$|R

25|$|For 1993, Häkkinen joined McLaren, {{originally}} as a race driver, {{although he}} became the team's official test driver when CART World Series driver Michael Andretti {{was hired by the}} team. Apart from regular testing duties, Häkkinen entered two Porsche Supercup races, held as a support race for the Monaco Grand Prix, where he started at pole position and took victory in both races. He was promoted to a Formula One race seat after the Italian Grand Prix, when Andretti left Formula One. Häkkinen entered the Portuguese Grand Prix where he out-qualified regular driver Ayrton Senna. During the race, he retired due from a collision with a concrete wall. At the next race held in Japan, Häkkinen claimed the first podium of his career with a third-place finish, and ended the season when his McLaren car suffered a <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> failure in Australia. Häkkinen concluded the season with 15th in the Drivers' Championship, scoring 4 points. In December, McLaren confirmed that Häkkinen would remain with the team on a three-year contract from the 1994 season onwards.|$|E

500|$|An {{investigation}} by the Interstate Commerce Commission discovered a design flaw on a style of passenger car used by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in which the handle of an angle cock, a valve used to close the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> when the car is the last one in the train, {{came into contact with}} a bottom crossmember of the coupler pocket. The angle cock would become closed, rendering the brakes on all the trailing cars inoperable. The third car behind 4876, New Haven 8665, was of this design, but the fourth car had a slightly different style of coupler. The difference between the two cars increased the frequency and the intensity of which the angle cock at the rear of 8655 would hit the crossmember. Earlier in the morning, the train was stopped outside of Kingston, Rhode Island, because the brakes on the final two cars were [...] "sticking" [...] and could not be released from the locomotive. Upon inspection, the angle cock on 8655 was found to be closed and was reopened by the engineer, but, after a locomotive and shift change, the matter was forgotten.|$|E
50|$|To {{prevent the}} train rolling back, the brakes were applied. The train did have {{continuous}} brakes, (i.e., all carriages had brakes {{which could be}} operated by the driver), but they were of the non-automatic vacuum type. That is to say, they were applied by creation of vacuum in the <b>brake</b> <b>pipes</b> and released by admitting air to the pipe.|$|R
50|$|Locomotive (air) {{and train}} (vacuum) brakes were fitted from new. Air train braking was added later, {{in some cases}} with {{high-level}} air <b>brake</b> <b>pipes</b> for use with Southern Region electric multiple units. Originally the class had radio communication sets fitted for use at Southampton Docks, the aerial located on the top right hand corner of the engine bonnet. These were removed when operation at the docks ceased.|$|R
25|$|To {{address the}} issue, GM said dealers will replace a {{micro-switch}} {{in the power}} <b>brake</b> vacuum <b>pipe</b> assembly.|$|R
2500|$|The Westinghouse {{air brake}} system is very trustworthy, but not infallible. Recall {{that the car}} {{reservoirs}} recharge only when the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> pressure {{is higher than the}} reservoir pressure, and that the car reservoir pressure will rise only to the point of equilibrium. [...] Fully recharging the reservoirs on a long train can require considerable time (8 to 10 minutes in some cases), during which the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> pressure will be lower than locomotive reservoir pressure.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the brakes}} must be applied before {{recharging}} has been completed, a larger <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> reduction {{will be required}} in order to achieve the desired amount of braking effort, as the system is starting out at a lower point of equilibrium (lower overall pressure). If many <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> reductions are made in short succession ("fanning the brake" [...] in railroad slang), a point may be reached where car reservoir pressure will be severely depleted, resulting in substantially reduced brake cylinder piston force, causing the brakes to fail. On a descending grade, the unfortunate result will be a runaway.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accident}} {{was determined to}} {{have been caused by}} a closed [...] "angle cock", a valve on the front and rear of all locomotives and rail cars used in the train's airbrake system, on the rear of the third car in the train. The handle of the angle cock had been improperly placed and had contacted the bottom of the car. Once it was closed the air <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> on all the cars behind the closed valve remained at full pressure, keeping the brakes released on those cars while the brakes on the locomotive and first three cars were applied in emergency.|$|E
5000|$|The {{danger of}} {{electrocution}} of staff at track level was the entire tenet behind the Southern Region/Railway adopting high-level <b>brake</b> <b>pipes</b> and control jumpers {{that are so}} distinctive of SR stock (nicknamed [...] "bagpipes"). Low-level <b>brake</b> <b>pipes</b> were still fitted to maintain standards but only used when high-level could not be. The ten redundant class 71 that were modified to become class 74 emerged from Crewe works with bagpipes in 1967/8 and 19 members of class 33 (a purely diesel powered locomotive), which were modified at Eastleigh for push-pull operation Southern Region TC units were so-fitted along with nearly all SR homed members of shunting classes 03 & 08. In contrast, almost all other contemporary locomotive classes (excepting notably classes 07, 09, 73 SR locomotives & class 50) had the multiple control jumpers and brake connectors on or under the buffer beam - a perilous place to be with 750 volts inches away. Despite overhead equipment being confined to {{just a handful of}} yards, class 71 was never retro-fitted with high-level connectors.|$|R
25|$|Anti-lock {{braking system}} (ABS) and Traction control system (TCS) (referred to as TCL on FTOs) {{can also be}} found as factory-fitted options on some earlier models such as the sports GX model. An easy-visual check for fitment of ABS to an FTO is to look in the engine bay - an alloy block, with six <b>brake</b> <b>pipes</b> emerging, will be present behind the battery and down against the bulkhead. ABS was {{standard}} equipment on facelift models.|$|R

2500|$|The {{compressor}} on {{the locomotive}} charges the main reservoir with air at [...] The train brakes are released by admitting {{air to the}} train pipe through the engineer's brake valve. A fully charged <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> is typically [...] for freight trains and [...] for passenger trains. The brakes are applied when the engineer moves the brake handle to the [...] "service" [...] position, which causes a reduction in pressure in the train pipe. In normal braking, the pressure in the train pipe does not reduce to zero. If it does fall to zero, (e.g., because of a broken brake hose) an emergency brake application will be made.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{since the}} <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> is {{typically}} used for control and supply of {{air to the}} cars, if an engineer is not careful, the air supply can be depleted. Further, since the engineer is only aware of the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> pressure and flow of air into the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe,</b> {{it is not easy}} to know the state of the train brakes at any given time.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{train braking}} systems use {{pneumatic}} valves {{to control and}} generate brake applications on the cars {{along the length of}} the train. In general, this conventional system consists of a <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> that runs the length of the train which supplies air to reservoirs mounted on each of the cars. When the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> and car components are charged with air, the brakes release. When the engineer needs to make a brake application, control valves in the locomotive reduce the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> pressure. As the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe</b> pressure reduces, the service portion on each car divert air from their reservoirs to their brake cylinders. To release the brakes, the engineer charges the <b>brake</b> <b>pipe.</b> This method of controlling the brakes on freight and passenger cars has been virtually the same since its invention by George Westinghouse in 1868.|$|E
5000|$|Although the 2013 {{model has}} since proved itself, {{it had a}} {{somewhat}} shaky start. In the UK, the R1200GS has been subject to various DVSA vehicle recalls covering the front brakes, anti-lock braking system, throttle cable, fuel pump, clutch, final drive assembly, <b>brake</b> <b>pipes,</b> and gearbox; and similar recalls have been issued in other countries. Early journalistic reports described the bike as having a front end [...] "head shake" [...] or speed wobble, and deliveries of the motorcycle were halted while BMW revised the front end geometry.|$|R
25|$|The {{intermediate}} cars sit on type MD530 bogies {{with steel}} suspension and an axle base of 2500mm. New wheels have {{a diameter of}} 920mm. They are replaced when they reach a diameter of 860mm. The cars are coupled 900mm above the rails by a semi-automatic coupling that was designed specifically for the ICE1. It couples two <b>brake</b> <b>pipes,</b> two electric trainlines, cables and two fibre optic cables. The passage between two cars is 1.1m wide and 2.05m high. Unlike on the InterCityExperimental, they are not positive locked on the outside.|$|R
50|$|ECP can use axle-generated {{power or}} wire-distributed power. The Fortescue railway in Australia uses wire-distributed power at 200 V DC. The Fortescue line also places the two <b>brake</b> <b>pipes</b> and single control/power cables {{on one side}} of the wagons only, as trains operate only as block loads and the wagons are not {{normally}} reversed. Having the wires on one side avoids the need for crew to stoop under the coupling, as would be the case with the normal configuration where the hose and wire cross under the coupling.|$|R
