40|$|In {{small scale}} trials, {{a process for}} the glucose oxidase (GOX) - catalysed {{oxidation}} of glucose in grape juice was developed and optimised. Up to 87 % utilisation of glucose was achieved, producing wines of ca. 6. 4 % alcohol. This equates to a 40 % reduction in alcohol content compared with conventionally processed wine. The effect of GOX -processing on the compositional, stability, and sensory properties of Müller-Thurgau and Riesling wines was investigated. Large amounts of gluconic acid are formed during GOX-treatment of juice, and {{a large portion of}} this is retained in the finished wine. In general GOX wines contained a higher concentration of esters and fatty acids, possibly due to alterations in juice amino acid composition. Relatively little change was observed in the concentration of the other volatile compounds. GOX wines show increased S 0 ₂-binding power compared to control wines. GOX wines also had a more golden colour, possible due to increased quinone production and regeneration of oxidisable phenolic substrate. They were stable against browning after six months of <b>bottle</b> <b>age,</b> whereas control wines continued to brown throughout the two year period of monitored aging. GOX wine appeared to be stable with respect to 'pinking' reactions and other parameters examined. Although heat/cold tests suggest they are at more risk of developing a protein haze, no haze was observed. GOX-treatment of Riesling juice significantly modified the taste and appearance attributes of the resultant wine, while other flavour parameters were relatively unaffected. The exceptions were fruit aroma intensity and length of flavour, which were generally decreased in GOX wines primarily due to the juice aeration required during processing. Perceived viscosity and density were relatively unchanged in GOX wines, probably due to the high acidity which itself is a detracting characteristic. The effect of ethanol on the perception of fullness in white wine was investigated using a time-intensity methodology. A general pattern of increase in perceived viscosity and density occurs with increasing alcohol content up to 10 and 12 % alcohol v/v respectively. The results support the anecdotal evidence that low-alcohol wines generally have reduced fullness compared with 'full-strength' wines, but this may not hold for wines above 12 % and possibly 10 % alcohol content. These findings raise some interesting questions on desirable alcohol levels for wine in general. In addition, the temporal parameters important in explaining perceived viscosity and density in white wine were determined...|$|E

40|$|Smoke taint is {{the term}} given to the {{objectionable}} smoky, medicinal, and ashy characters that can be exhibited in wines following vineyard exposure to bushfire smoke. This study sought to investigate the stability of smoke taint by determining changes in the composition and sensory properties of wines following 5 to 6 years of <b>bottle</b> <b>aging.</b> Small increases in guaiacol and 4 -methylguaiacol (of up to 6 μg/L) were observed after <b>bottle</b> <b>aging</b> of smoke-affected red and white wines, while syringol increased {{by as much as}} 29 μg/L. However, increased volatile phenol levels were also observed in control red wines, which indicated that changes in the composition of smoke-affected wines were due to acid hydrolysis of conjugate forms of both naturally occurring and smoke-derived volatile phenols. Acid hydrolysis of smoke-affected wines (post-bottle aging) released additional quantities of volatile phenols, which demonstrated the relative stability of glycoconjugate precursors to the mildly acidic conditions of wine. <b>Bottle</b> <b>aging</b> affected the sensory profiles of smoke-affected wines in different ways.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{varying levels of}} sulphur dioxide (SO₂) on the cold {{maceration}} process was investigated with Pinot noir (Vitis vinifera L.) wine. The effects of these varying levels on the wines composition and colour parameters were examined. Cold maceration is a technique whereby grapes are crushed and placed at low temperatures (4 - lO°C) in the presence 50 - 150 mgL⁻¹ SO₂. This process is believed to provide a medium for the extraction of water soluble phenolic compounds, rather than the alcoholic extraction employed in normal fermentations. The extraction of these phenolic compounds was monitored from the juice through to six months of <b>bottle</b> <b>age.</b> The changes were measured using both Spectrophotometric and High Performance Liquid Chromatographic (HPLC) procedures. Cold maceration wines {{were found to be}} not significantly different to the control wine in all compositional parameters other than titrateable acidity which was found to be less than the control for all the cold maceration wines. The unsulphured cold maceration wine was not significantly different from the control wine in any of the spectral measurements except natural degree of ionisation, in which it was higher, and total phenolics, in which it was lower. These results indicate that the cold maceration process alone does not alter the extraction of phenolic compounds. The HPLC analysis of the wine confirmed the spectral results indicating that their {{were no significant differences in}} the levels of extraction of anthocyanins. The sulphured cold maceration wines were significantly greater than the control in visible colour, colour density, total anthocyanins, natural degree of ionisation, ionised anthocyanins and total phenolics. These results followed similar patterns with wine ageing, at six months these wines were still significantly greater in all the measurements apart from natural degree of ionisation. The results for the sulphured cold maceration wines indicates that SO₂ is acting as a solvent for the extraction of phenolic compounds including anthocyanins. The 50 mgL⁻¹ SO₂ cold maceration wine had similar colour and phenolic content to the 100 mgL⁻¹ SO₂ cold maceration wine at bottling, at six months the 50 mgL⁻¹ SO₂ cold maceration wine still retained a similar colour to the 100 mgL⁻¹ SO₂ cold maceration wine but had vastly reduced anthocyanin content. This indicates that for the grapes utilised in this study the most appropriate level of addition at cold maceration would be 50 mgL⁻¹ of SO₂. With grapes of differing phenolic content the level of addition required will vary...|$|E
40|$|Pinot noir grapes offer a {{challenge}} for wine makers due to the variety’s unusual tannin distribution and non-acylated (colourless) anthocyanins. Initially, two scoping studies using replicated ‘French Press’ microvinification of Pinot noir must were undertaken and wines were evaluated for seven phenolic measures quantified by modified Somers analysis using UV-visible spectrophotometry and chemometrics (total phenolics, total pigment, anthocyanin, tannin, non-bleachable pigment, colour density, hue). The scoping studies established that yeast strain choice and maceration approach could significantly influence the concentration of phenolics in Pinot noir wine. A novel maceration process, microwave maceration, which {{was included in the}} scoping study was associated with significantly higher concentration of total phenolics, anthocyanin, tannin and non-bleachable pigment in wines at 18 months <b>bottle</b> <b>age,</b> compared with control wines that had been fermented on skins for a comparable period (usually seven or eight days). Microwave maceration involved heating Pinot noir must to 70 ºC using a domestic 1. 5 kW microwave oven. Must was held at that temperature for a ‘hold time’ period to allow for time/temperature mediated phenolic extraction, before being cooled to 27 ºC for inoculation and fermentation under controlled conditions. The rapid and effective phenolic extraction from microwave maceration of Pinot noir grape must allowed several novel approaches to winemaking. For example, microwave macerated must with one hour of hold time was pressed off skins and fermented as an ‘enriched juice’. Early press-off microwave maceration wines were equivalent to control wine that had been fermented on skins for most phenolic parameters, but were significantly higher in fourteen out of sixteen aroma compounds examined by GCMS. For example, the microwave treatment wines were generally four to six-fold higher for the acetates examined, and two-fold higher for most of the ethyl esters examined. Microwave maceration was effective for sanitation of Pinot noir grape must and reduced background yeast to≤ 100 cfu/mL by plating to Wallerstein Laboratories Nutrient agar, which was more effective than standard must sanitation by application of 50 mg/L sulphur dioxide in the form of potassium metabisulfite solution (2 x 104 cfu/mL). Due to the sanitation effect of microwave maceration, must did not require application of sulphur dioxide at crushing to suppress background yeast and bacteria. Sulfur dioxide and high fermentation temperatures are stressors which have been shown to inhibit malo-lactic fermentation in red wine fermentation. The rapid extraction of phenolics by microwave maceration prior to alcoholic fermentation, offset the need for high fermentation temperature (eg. 30 ºC) and this, coupled with the absence of sulphur dioxide, allowed co-inoculation of yeast and malo-lactic bacterial cultures for simultaneous alcoholic and malo-lactic fermentation. Early press-off microwave macerated Pinot noir must inoculated in this way finished alcoholic and malo-lactic fermentation within 17 days demonstrating the possibility of highly efficient red wine making from this novel process.

40|$|As {{the wine}} world {{continues}} to globalize, and industry competition grows, wine regions have increasingly focused on promoting {{one or two}} grape varietals which result in consistently expressive wines that best represent the viticultural area. A variety of studies have concentrated on defining regional cultivar typicity not only to enhance marketing techniques, but also to increase the understanding of a specific cultivar within the region from viticultural, enological, and sensorial perspectives, and findings may be relevant to the entire field. The Finger Lakes region of New York State has put itself on the world wine map through production of Rieslings with definitive sensory character. Preliminary assessments also suggest unique sensory profiles exist in the Rieslings according to which Finger Lake the grapes are cultivated. The sensory properties of Finger Lakes Rieslings, {{and the presence of}} subregional character, have not previously been investigated through rigorous, formal sensory analysis. This experiment sought to determine whether Riesling grapes grown along Keuka, Seneca, and Cayuga Lakes and from two distinct clones produced wines with unique sensory and compositional profiles. Six similar blocks of Riesling were selected to reduce effects of viticultural practices on compositional and sensory outcomes. Two sites, exclusively planted with clone 90 or clone 239, were selected from the east side of each lake. Viticultural treatments were standardized throughout the growing season. Inherent site and seasonal characteristics were recorded, and specific vine physiology and status measurements were collected from each block. Grapes were vinified, in duplicate lots from each site, by a standard winemaking protocol to yield two fermentation replicates. Instrumental analyses (GC-FID and GC-MS) were performed to quantify selected volatile aroma constituents of the Riesling wines. Generic descriptive analysis (DA) was performed on the wines by eleven panelists, screened for white wine consumption habits and sensory acuity. Sensory reference standards were developed during training and utilized along with intensity standards during orthonasal evaluation of the wines. Wines were also analyzed by HPLC for phenolic acids profiling. Statistical analyses of the volatile data showed that significant differences existed among some compounds. However, most of these differences were likely of no biological significance based on similarity of overall volatile profiles and vineyard site characteristics such as canopy light environment, vine water status, and crop load, factors which may impact wine quality. Monoterpene and TDN levels were at or below sensory threshold, and linalool was the only compound with apparent correlation to sensory data. DA panelists established 11 aroma attributes important to Finger Lakes Riesling wines. Wine aroma profiles were similar across vineyard sites, and two-way ANOVA results of lake, clone, and their interaction were not significant. Citrus, pineapple, linalool/floral, melon, and stemmy were among the descriptors present at the highest intensities. Phenolics data were characteristic of white wines as hydroxycinnamic acids and their tartrate esters dominated the profile. Higher concentrations of fertaric acid than coutaric acid were observed. While ANOVA showed significant results for lake, clone, and their interactions, clone had the strongest effect. These experiments indicate that sensory and aroma profiles of Riesling wines were similar despite differences in clonal material and growing conditions. However, the importance of seasonal growing conditions should not be overlooked as this experiment should be repeated over multiple years. The Riesling wines were also analyzed with less than six months of <b>bottle</b> <b>age,</b> and aging has the potential to impact wine differentiation. This sensory and volatile data is among the first to be reported for Riesling in the Finger Lakes.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of aroma {{compounds}} that are fundamental to the sensory properties of Sauvignon Blanc wines. Two such classes of compounds are volatile thiols and esters, both of which are modulated by yeast during alcoholic fermentation. Therefore, controlling fermentation using appropriate inoculated wine yeast is likely to be an effective means of enhancing wine aroma. In an initial study, Sauvignon Blanc wines were made using different commercial Saccharomyces yeast strains, with two-and three-yeast co-inoculations, as well as singlestrains, and equal blends of the single-strain wines after fermentation. The wines were analysed for volatile aroma compounds, and sensory descriptive analyses were performed approximately six months post-bottling. Differences in the chemical composition and sensory profiles were observed (which confirmed and elaborated on previous research). The coinoculated yeast treatments generally had higher concentrations of volatile thiols and higher levels of esters, with higher ratings for ‘tropical’ and ‘fruity’ attributes, than their single-strain components and the blends of the single-strain components. The co-inoculated treatments generally fermented faster and issues with an ‘acetic’ flavour for one strain were eliminated when included in co-inoculation. Some of the wines were stored, under screw cap closures, at 15 °C for three years, and the chemical and sensory analyses were repeated. The results showed that some of the yeast-derived flavour differences in young Sauvignon Blanc wines were retained after extended bottle storage. A subset of wines showing large sensory differences was subjected to consumer acceptance testing approximately six months after bottling. Differences in liking for the different yeast treatments were observed, with the largest group of consumers preferring the two-yeast coinoculation with an intermediate sensory profile, while another group favoured the wine made using the three-yeast co-inoculation with highest ratings for the ‘estery’ and ‘floral’ aromas and highest concentrations of volatile thiols. To further investigate this result, a study was conducted to identify which sensory attributes drive consumer preferences for Sauvignon Blanc wines, and furthermore, the volatile compounds and their levels responsible for these sensory attributes. Volatile thiols, esters and methoxypyrazines were added to a neutral white wine at realistic levels to mimic those found in Sauvignon Blanc wines. A sensory descriptive analysis was conducted, and a subset of samples was evaluated by consumers for liking. All three classes of compounds were responsible for influencing consumer liking, with ‘confectionary’, ‘cat urine/sweaty’, ‘cooked green vegetal’ and ‘fresh green’ aromas identified as the strongest drivers of liking for different groups of consumers identified. Demographic information, and wine usage and attitudes of these white wine consumers were also used in a segmentation exercise to gain insights into consumer behaviour. The results of this study demonstrate that the choice of yeast inoculum, using single or multiple yeasts, affects wine aroma composition and sensory properties even after an extended period of <b>bottle</b> <b>age,</b> and that there are sufficiently large differences to influence consumer preference. This study has also shown, for the first time, clear linking of Sauvignon Blanc aroma compounds, their associated sensory attributes and interactions, and effects on consumer preference. These findings highlight the importance of yeast strain selection, and give wine producers a clearer direction for tailoring white wine styles that can be targeted to specific consumer groups.
