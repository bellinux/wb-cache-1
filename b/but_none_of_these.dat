5|$|After her death, 116-year-old Marie-Louise Meilleur {{became the}} oldest {{recognized}} living person. Both {{before and after}} Calment's death, {{there have been several}} claims to have surpassed her age (see Unverified longevity claims), <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> have been proven and Calment therefore continues to hold the record for the oldest verified person ever.|$|E
5|$|She {{lived in}} Eastern China, {{residing}} {{for most of}} her life in the Zhejiang and Jiangsu districts. After a career as a celebrated courtesan in Nanjing, Xue married several times, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> unions lasted.

5|$|At {{some point}} after 1605 {{her career as}} a courtesan came to an end when she married the playwright and bureaucrat Shen Defu.

5|$|During the war the {{chancellery}} was destroyed, {{except for}} the exterior walls, by air raids and in the Battle of Berlin in 1945.

25|$|After 1895, Dunlop's {{appearances}} for Somerset {{became more}} spasmodic and less successful. There {{were a few}} matches in 1897, then again in 1900, 1901 and 1902 and a final game in 1905, <b>but</b> in <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> seasons did he pass 50 again.|$|R

5|$|In 2013, a {{year before}} the {{payphone}} contract was set to expire, there was a competition that sought ideas to further repurpose the network of payphones.

5|$|Although the Ministry of Education {{reported}} that eleven schools had sustained a combined total of $300,000 of damage, the Ministry of Communications, Works, Transport, and Public Utilities {{reported that}} most of the country's other major infrastructure remained functional. They estimated that the cost to clean up all of the roads and drains was $900,000 and the cost to repair the utilities and communications damage was another $505,000. Saint Lucia Air and Sea Ports Authority reported another $922,000 of damage, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> sectors experienced prolonged disruptions to their functionality.|$|E
5|$|Because of Kilmer's close {{identification}} with Roman Catholicism and his correspondence with many priests and theologians, a tree located near a grotto {{dedicated to the}} Virgin Mary at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, has been asserted as {{the inspiration for the}} poem.

5|$|The Empire of Nicaea, {{founded by}} the Laskarid dynasty, managed to reclaim Constantinople from the Latins in 1261 and defeat Epirus. This led to a {{short-lived}} revival of Byzantine fortunes under Michael VIII Palaiologos, but the war-ravaged Empire was ill-equipped {{to deal with the}} enemies that now surrounded it. To maintain his campaigns against the Latins, Michael pulled troops from Asia Minor and levied crippling taxes on the peasantry, causing much resentment. Massive construction projects were completed in Constantinople to repair the damage of the Fourth Crusade, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> initiatives was of any comfort to the farmers in Asia Minor suffering raids from Muslim ghazis.|$|E
5|$|The {{woolly mammoth}} coexisted with early humans, who used its bones and tusks for making art, tools, and dwellings, and the species was also hunted for food. It {{disappeared}} from its mainland range {{at the end}} of the Pleistocene 10,000 years ago, most likely through climate change and consequent shrinkage of its habitat, hunting by humans, or a combination of the two. Isolated populations survived on St. Paul Island until 5,600 years ago and Wrangel Island until 4,000 years ago. After its extinction, humans continued using its ivory as a raw material, a tradition that continues today. It has been proposed the species could be recreated through various means, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> are yet feasible.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{proposals}} {{were made in}} the 1900s to reconstruct them and replace their obsolete armor and guns, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> were carried out. Ekaterina II and Chesma were both eventually sunk as target ships after being decommissioned in 1907, but both Sinop and Georgii Pobedonosets were converted into artillery training ships before becoming guardships at Sevastopol before World War I. There they spent most of the war and were captured by the Germans in 1918, who eventually turned them over to the British who sabotaged their engines when they abandoned the Crimea in 1919. Immobile they were captured by both the Whites and the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. Sinop was abandoned when Wrangel's fleet sailed for Bizerte, but Georgii Pobedonosets was towed there. Sinop was scrapped beginning in 1922 by the Soviets while Georgii Pobedonosets was eventually scrapped in Bizerte beginning in 1930 by the French.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, French {{public opinion}} was {{strongly}} {{in favour of}} the outcome of the conference, the only criticism coming from the far left that Republican ships would not receive direct protection. The German mood was restrained, where the press were satisfied by the Soviet exclusion from patrols. In Spain, the Republicans– on the verge of disaster– were largely in favour, and the Nationalists strongly against. The Republicans praised the improved safety of the shipping routes, but were somewhat unhappy that belligerent rights had not been granted to both sides. The Nationalists made several complaints, including one over the route recommended to shipping, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> resulted in changes to the agreement. The agreement was welcomed by other members of the League of Nations. Italian historians tend to downplay the importance of the Nyon Conference, often seeing it as a mere extension of the Non-Intervention Committee.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals are {{generally}} defined as metals with relatively high densities, atomic weights, or atomic numbers. The criteria used, and whether metalloids are included, {{vary depending on}} the author and context. In metallurgy, for example, a heavy metal may be defined on the basis of density, whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number, while a chemist would likely be more concerned with chemical behaviour. More specific definitions have been published, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> have been widely accepted. The definitions surveyed in this article encompass up to 96 out of the 118 known chemical elements; only mercury, lead and bismuth meet all of them. Despite this lack of agreement, the term (plural or singular) is widely used in science. A density of more than 5g/cm3 is sometimes quoted as a commonly used criterion and is used in the body of this article.|$|E
5|$|The 21st century {{began with}} two more cup titles for Maccabi Tel Aviv, before two seasons in a row saw {{respective}} firsts for the Israel State Cup. In 2003 Hapoel Ramat Gan became the first side to win the cup final from outside the top division, {{and a year later}} Bnei Sakhnin became the first club from a mostly Arab-Israeli town to lift the trophy. Three more second-tier clubs, Hapoel Haifa, Maccabi Herzliya and Hapoel Ashkelon, reached the final in 2004, 2005 and 2007 respectively, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> won the deciding match. Following Bnei Sakhnin's victory teams from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv reclaimed dominance—Maccabi Tel Aviv lifted the cup in 2005, Beitar Jerusalem won two titles in a row in 2008 and 2009 and Hapoel Tel Aviv twice in a row in 2006 and 2007, and then three times consecutively from 2010 to 2012. Hapoel Ramat Gan won the cup {{for the second time in}} 2013, this time as a top-flight club.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} measure the {{absorbance}} of a colorless compound a Bradford assay must be performed. Some colorless compounds such as proteins can be quantified at an Optical Density of 280 nm due {{to the presence of}} aromatic rings such as Tryptophan, Tyrosine and Phenylalanine <b>but</b> if <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> amino acids are present then the absorption cannot be measured at 280 nm.|$|R
5|$|The {{failure of}} Operation Mascot {{convinced}} {{the commander of}} the Home Fleet, Admiral Sir Henry Moore, that the Fleet Air Arm's main strike aircraft, the Fairey Barracuda dive bomber, was not suited to operations against Kaafjord. As the dive bombers' slow speed gave the defenders of Kaafjord enough time to cover Tirpitz in a smoke screen between the time incoming raids were detected and their arrival over the target area, Moore concluded that further attacks using these aircraft would be futile. However, the Admiralty judged that repeatedly striking Kaafjord with Barracudas over a 48-hour period might wear down the German defences and exhaust the supply of fuel for Tirpitzs protective smoke generators. Consideration was also given to flying fast and long-ranged de Havilland Mosquito bombers off the carriers in an attempt to achieve surprise, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> land-based aircraft could be spared from supporting the Allied bombing of Germany. Despite his misgivings, Moore agreed to make another attempt to strike Tirpitz.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} after the strike, the world's silver market dropped, causing the {{foreclosure}} {{of many of the}} mines. To compensate for the drop in prices, the mines' stockholders reduced the wages of the miners. Instead of striking again, the miners accepted this. In addition, the miners inadvertently dug below the water table, and the mine shafts began filling with water faster than it could be pumped out. By 1884, most of the mines were idle or closed; the last was officially closed in 1891, although lessees of the mines continued to operate them past that year. Many merchants went bankrupt and left town. The Silver Reef mines produced about $8million worth of silver ore. Between 1891 and 1901, another $250,000 worth was mined. Several people attempted to restart mining operations in 1898, 1909, 1916, and 1950, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> attempts were successful. After Silver Reef's mines were closed, many of the buildings were purchased for their lumber and building stone. One buyer dismantled the building he bought and discovered $10,000 in gold coins. News of the find spread quickly, and most of the buildings in Silver Reef were demolished in hopes of discovering more gold, but none was found.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the attack}} on 17 July, the British learned from intercepted German radio {{transmissions}} and reports provided by Secret Intelligence Service agents that Tirpitz had not suffered any significant damage. Admiral Moore blamed the failure of Operation Mascot on the inexperience of the aircrew involved in the attack, and criticised the strike leader for not selecting alternative targets after {{it became clear that}} Tirpitz could not be accurately bombed. Moore also judged that further attacks on Kaafjord using Barracudas would be futile, as the dive bombers' slow speed gave the Germans enough time to cover Tirpitz with smoke between the time raids were detected and their arrival over the target area. The Admiralty was hopeful that a strategy of repeatedly striking Kaafjord over a 48-hour period would wear down the defences, and Moore agreed to attempt another attack. Consideration was also given to flying fast and long-ranged de Havilland Mosquito bombers off the carriers in an attempt to achieve surprise, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> land-based aircraft could be spared from supporting the Allied bombing of Germany.|$|E
