5|$|The spores are elongated, smooth, {{and have}} {{dimensions}} of 4–6 by 1.5–2 µm.

The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are six-spored.|$|E
5|$|The spores of C.stercoreus {{are roughly}} spherical and {{relatively}} large, with typical dimensions of 20–35x20–25µm, although great variability in spore size has been noted. The spores are sessile (growing {{directly from the}} surface of the <b>basidium,</b> without attachment via a sterigmata), and are separated from the basidia after it collapses and gelatinizes. This is accompanied by the gelatinization of the inner walls of the peridiole.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe godeyi {{leaves a}} snuff-brown spore print, while the {{individual}} spores themselves are smooth and almond-shaped. The spores measure 9 to 11.5 by 5.5 to 7micrometres. Each <b>basidium</b> bares four spores. Both the cheilocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} edges of the gills) and the pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the faces of the gills) are spindle- or bottle-shaped, with some kind of encrustation at the tip. They have thick cell walls.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius funalis {{mushrooms}} leave a white spore print. The individual basidiospores are ellipsoidal, {{and measure}} 6.5 to 8 by 4 to 5micrometres (μm). They have thin cell walls, {{and they are}} smooth and colourless. The spores are inamyloid, meaning {{that they do not}} stain when they come into contact with iodine from Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The spores are borne on club-shaped basidia measuring 20 to 25 by 4.5 to 7μm, with two spores per <b>basidium.</b> There are also club-shaped basidioles (under-developed basidia).|$|E
5|$|The basidia are 15–25×3.5–5.5µm {{and have}} a slim, club-like shape. Each <b>basidium</b> {{features}} four sterigmata, each of which bear one spore. The spores' shape is slimly ellipsoidal or cylindrical. Their surface is smooth and their walls are thin. Although they are colourless and hyaline, the spores are amyloid, meaning they will turn bluish or purple when stained with Melzer's reagent. This characteristic differs from other very similar species, and this gave the genus its name.|$|E
5|$|The hyphal {{system is}} monomitic, {{containing}} only generative hyphae. These hyphae are {{not less than}} 6μm in diameter. All European species lack clamp connections, but they {{are present in the}} North American species P.fibulatus and P.mississippiensis. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. Cystidia are either absent, or present infrequently as incompletely differentiated cystidioles (sterile cells about the size of an immature <b>basidium).</b> In mass, the spores are white. Spores are broadly ellipsoid to roughly spherical, and echinulose (covered with small spines). They are also hyaline and inamyloid.|$|E
5|$|The spores are 4–7 by 2–3µm, oblong-elliptical, smooth, and {{embedded}} in the gleba. A 1982 study revealed that spores of species in the Phallaceae family, including Mutinus elegans, have a hilar scar (0.2–0.3µm diameter) that is observable with scanning electron microscopy. The hilar scar is a circular indentation {{at one end of}} the spore, and it most likely results during the separation of the attachment of the spore to the sterigma of the <b>basidium.</b>|$|E
5|$|In deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, {{the spores}} appear almost black, tinged with purple. The spores are spherical in shape or nearly so, smooth, thick-walled, and lack a germ pore. They are nonamyloid (not {{absorbing}} iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent), black-brown, and have dimensions of 4.5–7.5 by 5.5–6.5µm. There is a prominent scar where the spore was once attached to the <b>basidium</b> (the spore-bearing cell) through the sterigma. The basidia are broadly club-shaped, and mostly four-spored, with long, slender sterigmata. Unlike other Agaricus species, the spores of A.deserticola are not shot off, but are instead dispersed when they sift out of the dried, mature fruit bodies after the peridium breaks open.|$|E
5|$|The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, are {{club-shaped}} {{with long}} stalks. They typically hold 4 spores that are sessile, that is, attached {{directly to the}} surface of the <b>basidium,</b> rather than by a short stalk (a sterigmata). Spores measure about 15 to 20µm long by 8 to 12µm wide. They are elliptical, smooth, hyaline, and notched at one end. During development, the spores are separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize along with other cells lining the inner walls of the peridiole. The spores expand in size somewhat after being detached from the basidia.|$|E
5|$|Typhula quisquiliaris spores are {{narrowly}} ellipsoid, {{and measure}} from 9 to 14 by 4 to 5.5 micrometres (μm). The spores are white, and contain small granules. The spores are borne on basidia which measure 50 to 70 by 7 to 8 μm, with four spores on each <b>basidium.</b> The downy covering {{of the stem}} {{is made up of}} thick-walled hairs, each measuring 15 to 60 by 3 to 7 μm, though they are often swollen towards the base. The sclerotium measures from 1.5 to 3 by 0.5 μm, and is a pale yellow colour. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus olla has -shaped spores with {{dimensions}} of 10–146–8µm. In 1927, George Willard Martin examined the microscopic features of {{various members of}} the Nidulariaceae family, including Cyathus olla. He noted that in this species, the basidia—spore-bearing cells—are club-shaped or cylindrical and have long stems, and they sometimes have a clamp connection at the basal end of the structure. Basidia typically hold between two and four sessile spores that are directly attached to the <b>basidium,</b> rather than via a sterigma. Revealed only after the spore is separated, a temporary apiculus marks the point of attachment. The spores are generally separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize; this basidial breakdown typically occurs simultaneously with a gelatinization of cells lining the inside wall of the peridiole. After separating from the basidia the outer wall of the spores may thicken, although they generally do not increase in size.|$|E
5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{produces}} basidiospores {{that are}} ellipsoidal or broadly ellipsoidal in shape. The spore shape {{is one of}} the features that makes the species readily recognisable microscopically, and the spores measure from 4.5 to 6.1 by 3.5 to 5 micrometres(μm). The average spore length is 5.25μm, while the average width is 4.14μm. The spores have thick cell walls, and are hyaline. They are strongly cyanophilous, meaning that the cell walls will readily absorb methyl blue stain. In addition, they are weakly dextrinoid, meaning that they will stain slightly reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The spores are borne on barrel-shaped basidia, with four spores per <b>basidium,</b> measuring 8 to 12 by 6 to 7μm. There are also basidioles, which are similar in shape to the basidia, but slightly smaller.|$|E
5|$|The {{almond-shaped}} spores {{are typically}} 10–12.5 by 6–7μm with thick walls measuring between 0.5–1.2μm. They {{have a small}} central apiculus (a depressed area when the spore was once attached to the <b>basidium</b> via the sterigma). When mounted in distilled water, they have a coarsely warty surface and appear rusty brown in colour. When mounted in a 3% KOH solution, the spores are pale lilac grey, and the surface ornamentation forms swollen pustules that loosen and dissolve. Spores are dextrinoid (meaning they turn reddish-brown when stained with Melzer's reagent) and cyanophilic (red in acetocarmine). The basidia are club-shaped, and four-spored with sterigmata up to 9.5μm long. The ridges of the locules comprise erect cystidia mixed with chains of erect cylindrical hyphae measuring 4–6μm in diameter. The cystidia are roughly cylindrical, and have dimensions of 20–60 by 4–9μm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae of the fungus.|$|E
5|$|The edible Coprinellus bisporus {{is nearly}} {{identical}} but lacks the yellowish cap granules and only has two spores per <b>basidium.</b> The scaly inky cap (Coprinus variegatus = Coprinus quadrifidus) has a grayish-brown cap with dull white to brownish scales; its odor is disagreeable. The trooping crumble cap (Coprinellus disseminatus, edible) has smaller, yellow-brown to grey-brown caps and white gills that turn black {{but do not}} dissolve away; it always grows in large clusters on rotting wood (sometimes buried wood). Coprinus atramentarius is a larger, gray species that grows in dense clusters on stumps or on the ground from buried wood, lacks glistening particles on the cap, and the cap and gills dissolve at maturity. Coprinellus radians develops singly or in clumps from a tufted mat of coarse yellow-orange mycelium on the wood. Coprinellus truncorum is also covered with glistening granules and {{is said to be}} almost indistinguishable from C.micaceus in the field; microscopy is needed to tell the difference, as C.truncorum has ellipsoid spores with a rounded germ pore, compared to the shield-shaped (mitriform) spores with truncated germ pores of C.micaceus. One study suggests that compared to C.truncorum, C.micaceus is browner {{in the center of the}} cap (rather than grayish) and has a greater tendency to grow in clusters; more molecular evidence is required to determine if the two taxa are genetically identical.|$|E
25|$|In its sexual state, Sporidiobolus salmonicolor {{produces}} dikaryotic hyphae with clamp connections. At {{the terminal}} {{end of the}} hyphae, thick-walled teliospores are produced. Teliospores are 9–15μm in diameter, brown in color, spherical in shape and contain lipid-rich globules. Upon germination of the teliospore, basidia with basidiospores are produced. Basidia are transversely septate, two-celled and 4–6 x 20–25μm in size. Each <b>basidium</b> will generally produce two large basidiospores that are 5–6 × 7–10μm in size. Prior {{to the production of}} the <b>basidium,</b> endospores have also been known to form in the interior of teliospores. This phenomenon is associated with the production of meiospores within the teliospore cytoplasm, ultimately released by rupture of the teliospore wall.|$|E
25|$|The spores are white, roughly spherical, thick-walled, non-amyloid, smooth, {{and have}} {{dimensions}} of 7–11 by 6–10 µm. Basidia are club-shaped, 60–80 by 6–8µm, and 2-spored. Cystidia are absent. Sterigmata, the slender {{projections of the}} <b>basidium</b> that bear the spores, may be straight or curved, and up to 7–8µm long.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} microscopic feature for identification of mushrooms is the spores. Their color, shape, size, attachment, ornamentation, and reaction to chemical tests often {{can be the}} crux of an identification. A spore often has a protrusion at one end, called an apiculus, which {{is the point of}} attachment to the <b>basidium,</b> termed the apical germ pore, from which the hypha emerges when the spore germinates.|$|E
25|$|Cortinarius badiolaevis {{produces}} spores which measure from 7 to 8.5 by 4.5 to 5.5micrometers (μm). They {{range from}} almond-shaped to ellipsoid. There are wart-like ornamentations, {{but it is}} not heavily ornamented. They are dextrinoid, meaning that they stain red-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution, and stains darkly in potassium hydroxide (the KOH test). The spores are borne on basidia, with four spores per <b>basidium.</b> The basidia measure 25 to 35 by 7 to 10µm.|$|E
500|$|In 1906 Charles E. Lewis {{studied and}} {{illustrated}} {{the development of}} the basidia in order to compare the nuclear behavior of the two-spored with that of the four-spored forms. Initially (1), the young <b>basidium,</b> appearing as a club-shaped branch from the subhymenium, is filled with cytoplasm and contains two primary nuclei, which have distinct nucleoli. As the <b>basidium</b> grows larger, the membranes of the two nuclei contact (2), and then the membrane disappears at the point of contact (3). The two primary nuclei remain distinct for a short time, but eventually the two nuclei fuse completely to form a larger secondary nucleus with a single secondary nucleolus (4, 5). The <b>basidium</b> increases in size after the primary nuclei fuse, and the nucleus migrates {{towards the end of the}} basidia (6, 7). During this time, the nucleus develops vacuoles [...] "filled by the nuclear sap in the living cell". Chromosomes are produced from the nucleolar threads, and align transversely near the apex of the <b>basidium,</b> connected by spindles (8–10). The chromosomes then move to the poles, forming the daughter nuclei that occupy different positions in the basidium; the daughters now have a structure similar to that of the parent nuclei (11). The two nuclei then divide to form four nuclei, similar to fungi with four-spored basidia (12, 13). The four nuclei crowd together at some distance from the end of the <b>basidium</b> to form an irregular mass (14). Shortly thereafter, the sterigmata (slender projections of the basidia that attach the spores) begin to form (15), and cytoplasm begins to pass through the sterigmata to form the spores (16). Although Lewis was not able to clearly determine from observation alone whether the contents of two or four nuclei passed through the sterigmata, he deduced, by examining older basidia with mature spores, that only two nuclei enter the spores (16, 17).|$|E
500|$|Inocybe cookei {{leaves a}} snuff-brown spore print. The spores {{themselves}} are bean-shaped, measuring from [...] by [...] The {{walls of the}} spores (which are around [...] thick) can be smooth or slightly wrinkled, {{and there is a}} distinct depression just above the hilum (the scar where the spore was once attached to the <b>basidium).</b> The basidia are four-spored, and the thin-walled, gill-edge cheilocystidia are pear-shaped.|$|E
500|$|The spores are {{cylindrical}} in shape, smooth, thin-walled, and hyaline (translucent), with {{dimensions of}} 4–6 by 2–2.5µm. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that {{one end of}} the spores has a hilar scar—an indentation in the spore wall that results during its separation from the sterigma of the <b>basidium.</b> The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are usually eight-spored, and the gleba composed of chains of roughly spherical, fusiform, [...] to broadly club-shaped cells that are either 6.5–7.4 by 2.8–5.6µm or 37.1–46.3 by 18–28µm and also mixed with [...] cells 2.3–4.5µm wide.

The spore surface is warty and full of wrinkles, with a smooth depression where the spore was once attached via the [...] to the <b>basidium</b> (the spore-bearing cell). When in potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, the spores appear tawny or darker rusty-brown, with an apical callus. The basidia are four-spored (rarely with a very few two-spored ones), roughly cylindrical when producing spores, but with a slightly tapered base, and measure 21–29 by 5–8.4µm.|$|E

The spores are covered with fairly large warts, measuring from [...] from the main spore in height. There is no germ pore or plage, and there is no clear depression around the hilum (the area where the spore was attached to the sterigma). The spores turn an orange-yellow to orange-brown colour in potassium hydroxide, and turn reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent and in Lugol's iodine, but they are not metachromatic.|$|E
500|$|Peniophora quercina {{produces}} spores {{which take}} {{the shape of}} a curved cylinder (sausage shaped), and have been variously reported as light red, pink and white. They measure from 8 to 12 by 3 to 4 micrometres (μm). The spores are borne on basidia, with four spores per <b>basidium,</b> which measure 50 to 70 by 5 to 12 μm. The species has hyaline cystidia with thick cell walls, which are [...] "heavily encrusted with crystalline material". The cystidia are often buried within the fruit body as it grows, but can be found in large numbers. They have been variously described as spindle-shaped or conical, and measure 25 to 35 by 10 to 15 μm. The hyphae have clamp connections, and the base of the fruit body is made up of brown hyphae with moderately thick cell walls, measuring 3 to 4 μm in width.|$|E
500|$|Fruit bodies {{produce a}} spore print ranging in color from pinkish brown to reddish brown. The spores measure 10–17 by 3.5–4.5μm, and are fusoid (somewhat spindle-shaped) to elliptical. [...] Spores have a smooth surface, and a plage (a {{depressed}} {{area where the}} spore was once attached to the <b>basidium</b> via the sterigma). The spore walls are thin, up to 0.2μm. They are pale yellow to cream green in a solution of potassium hydroxide, pale yellow-rust in Melzer's reagent, and blue in Methyl blue; without stain, they appear hyaline to pale yellow. The cap cuticle is an interwoven trichodermium—a cellular arrangement whereby the hyphae are of roughly equal length and arranged perpendicularly to the surface. [...] The terminal (end) cells of the trichodermium are 6.5–11.5μm in diameter, and roughly equal in width throughout their length. They are encrusted with a crystalline substance, a feature that is uncommon in the Boletaceae. The hyphae of the tubes are 5.0–13.0μm in diameter. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
500|$|Lycoperdon pulcherrimum {{closely resembles}} L.echinatum, but its spines are stouter, do not turn brown in age, {{and the surface}} of the fruit body {{underneath}} the spines is smooth, not pitted. Alexander H.

Lycoperdon compactum, found only in New Zealand, also resembles L.echinatum in appearance, but differs in having smaller spores, capillitia that are hyaline (translucent) and septate (with partitions that divide the capillitia into compartments).|$|E
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Spongiforma species have a brain-like to sponge-like form, and grow {{on the surface}} of the ground. They do not have a stalk, and lack a layer of outer skin. The small {{cavities}} (locules) of the fruit body are irregular in outline and measure between [...] in diameter. They are lined with a smooth, greyish-orange to brown or reddish brown hymenium (spore-bearing tissue), with sterile ridges that range in colour from white to cream. The columella (a column-like structure extending up into the fruit body) is poorly developed, pear-shaped, cream-coloured, and attached at the base to white rhizomorphs. The basidiospores are brown to vinaceous-brown in mass, almond-shaped, bilaterally symmetrical, and finely wrinkled. Spores bear a central apiculus (a region that was once attached to the sterigmata at the end of a <b>basidium)</b> and a small apical pore. The spores are reddish-brown in water, violet grey in 3%potassium hydroxide, inamyloid, and cyanophilic (turning red in the stain acetocarmine). The basidia are four-spored, and do not discharge the spores forcibly. Cystidia are common on the sterile locule edges; they are hyaline (translucent) and range in shape from cylindrical to ventricose (swollen in the middle) or rostrate (with a beaklike proboscis). The hyphae of the flesh are gelatinous and inamyloid. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
500|$|The irregularly shaped spores measure from 7.2 to 11.6 by 5.1 to 7.9 micrometres (μm), each {{featuring}} a few thick protusions. Abnormal spores {{of a different}} shape, sometimes with protrusions more distinct from the actual spore than is typical, can sometimes form; this is perhaps due to poor weather. The club-shaped basidia measure 25 to 40 by 9 to 14 μm, and each <b>basidium</b> bears four spores. The yellowish pleurocystidia (cystidia {{on the face of}} the gill) are ventricose or occasionally club-shaped, measuring 41 to 89 by 12 to 23 μm, including a cell wall up to 4.5 μm thick. The tip often bends and is encrusted with crystal-like structures, while the base tapers, or narrows into a small stalk. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of the gill) are much the same, but they are typically somewhat shorter and stouter. The longer caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) occur all the way down the stem and measure up to 99 μm in length with a more variable shape. The mushrooms also feature [...] "paracystidia", club-shaped cystidia-like structures on the gills lacking crystals, as well as [...] "cauloparacystidia" [...] on the stem.

The cheilocystidia (cystidia {{on the edge of a}} gill) are 19–42 by 5–11µm, swollen, cylindrical to narrowly cub-shaped, thin-walled, and infrequent. The flesh of the hymenium is boletoid and strongly divergent (composed of different tissue layers). The mediostratum (middle tissue layer) is 24.7–45.7µm wide, and made of many parallel, slightly interwoven hyphae. The lateral stratum hyphae are 4.4–8.4µm wide, hyaline, gelatinized in a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH), and regularly septate. The cap cuticle is a densely interwoven trichodermial palisade (an erect, roughly parallel chains of closely packed cells) of cylindrical elements with inflated terminal cells. The terminal cells are 23.5–51.9 by 9.4–16.8µm, inamyloid, cylindrical to club-shaped, interwoven, and concentrated on the squamules. The marginal appendiculae are composed of wefts of interwoven inflated hyphae, some with faint golden spirally arranged encrusting pigments that are evident when mounted in water, KOH, and Melzer's reagent. The flesh of the cap is composed of highly interwoven hyphae measuring 7.4–11.1µm wide that are hyaline in water, gelatinized and hyaline in KOH, and regularly septate. The stipitipellis (stem cuticle) is a trichodermial palisade of cylindrical elements with inflated terminal cells. The terminal cells project 30.4–63µm, and they are cylindrical to club-shaped, occasionally with an abrupt tapering point. The flesh of the stem is made of densely interwoven hyphae that are 4.9–7.2µm wide, with spirally arranged, faint golden encrusting pigments that can be seen in KOH, Melzer's reagent, and water. Clamp connections are absent in this species.|$|E
