5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also reduces silica {{which has}} to <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pig iron. The silica is reacted with calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms a slag which floats {{to the surface of}} the molten pig iron. The direct contact of flue gas with the iron causes contamination with sulfur if it is present in the fuel. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.|$|E

5|$|Carey and Helford co-wrote {{the pilot}} episode together. Helford had {{expected}} The Drew Carey Show to air at 8:30pm.

5|$|Electoral success overtook {{the party}} and Janmaat began to make {{controversial}} statements in the media. Based on his conviction that high office should be restricted to third-generation Dutch nationals, he suggested that several cabinet ministers, including Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch-Ballin who was of Jewish descent, and Agriculture State Secretary Dzsingisz Gabor who was of Hungarian descent, should <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Dutch leadership. This marked the start of prosecutions of Centre Democrats party members on charges of racism, {{as well as the}} decision by the other parties in Parliament and government to place a cordon sanitaire around the party.|$|E
5|$|In 1553, {{orders were}} issued for the {{artillery}} pieces to <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> blockhouse {{and taken to}} the Tower of London; the fort was then demolished between 1557 and 1558, the brick and stone from the site being reused to repair the Tower. The former site was probably rediscovered during excavations in 1826, but was destroyed during {{the building of the}} Gravesend Canal Basin, Canal Road and the Gordon Pleasure Gardens later in the 19th century. Archaeological investigations between 1973 and 1978 uncovered the foundations of the blockhouse, now protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E

5|$|In 1992 {{an attempt}} was made to extract a {{mitochondrial}} DNA sequence from the skeletal remains of C.d.guildayi to compare its relationship to other Canis species. The attempt was unsuccessful because these remains had been removed from the LaBrea pits and tar could not <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bone material. In 2014 an attempt to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth from the tar pits also failed, with the study concluding that organic compounds from the asphalt permeate the bones of all ancient samples from the LaBrea pits, hindering the extraction of DNA samples.|$|E
5|$|In England, Parliament held James {{abandoned}} the throne by fleeing from English territory to France. The Convention argued James forfeited the Scottish throne by his actions, as {{listed in the}} Articles of Grievances. This effectively rejected {{the principle of the}} Divine Right of Kings which had driven political conflict for the last 60 years. If James could <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> throne because of his acts, monarchs derived their legitimacy not from God but the people as represented by Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In his memoirs, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szpilman also {{compared}} {{himself to}} Crusoe and, like Fogelman, emphasized the isolation and hopelessness which characterized the Warsaw Crusoes.

The movie that was eventually filmed, Miasto Nieujarzmione ("Unyoked city"), was heavily censored by the communist authorities, and its original theme changed {{to such an extent that}} Mi≈Çosz requested his name <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> film's credits. The experience with the film contributed to Mi≈Çosz's disillusionment with cinema as an artistic medium.|$|E
