According to music journalist Stephen Davis, although {{the song was}} released in 1971, it took until 1973 before the song's popularity ascended to truly [...] "anthemic" [...] status. As Page himself recalled, [...] "I knew it was good, but I didn't know {{it was going to}} be almost like an anthem ... <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the gem of the album, sure." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blethyn's {{breakthrough}} {{came with}} Mike Leigh's 1996 drama Secrets & Lies. Starring alongside Marianne Jean-Baptiste, she portrayed a lower-class box factory worker, who after years once again {{comes in contact}} with her illegitimate grown-up black daughter, whom she gave up for adoption thirty years earlier. For her improvised performance, Blethyn was praised {{with a variety of}} awards, including the Best Actress Award at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, the British Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Upon its success, Blethyn later stated: [...] "I knew it was a great film, but I didn't expect it to get the attention it did because none of his other films had and I thought they were just as good. Of course, I didn't know what it was about until I saw it in the cinema because of the way that he worksâ€” <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> good. That it reached a wider audience surprised me." [...] Besides critical acclaim Secrets & Lies also became a financial success; budgeted at an estimated $4.5 million, the film grossed an unexpected $13.5 million in its limited theatrical run in North America.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel detailed {{what it was like}} preparing for her character's rape scenes. She explained that it was grueling and that there were only four people in the episode. She found it to be [...] "very work-intensive," [...] emotionally haunting, and voiced that she had trouble sleeping. She elaborated that [...] "these" [...] type of scenes really stay with a person. Riegel and co-star William deVry (Michael Cambias) rehearsed the scenes on their own, which normally would not have been the case. Riegel commented that it definitely required more work than an ordinary episode. Asked if she was frightened of deVry during Bianca's rape scenes, she admitted that she was and that it was a testament to deVry's acting skills. About the uneasiness of the scenes and whether or not she was frightened or intimidated by [...] "the gravity" [...] of the storyline, she stated, [...] "Absolutely, I was. To be honest, I didn't know if I could handle it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a very important thing to do and that the show was serious about handling it well." [...] She added, [...] "I knew we could reach people, and that it was powerful stuff. I could feel the power of it. And I knew I should put myself through this because ultimately it might help somebody, touch somebody, make people talk about it. And rape is something people should talk about." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{not these}} he saw, {{but rather the}} grey English church, and the graves ranged side by side before the yew near the wicket gate.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> trouble," [...] said Whitwell, with a dignity which-his {{sympathy for}} her gave a countenance better {{adapted to the}} {{expression}} of the lighter emotions.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not {{kindness}} {{that prompted}} the offer. It is not true that suffering ennobles the character; happiness does that sometimes, but suffering, for the most part, makes men petty and vindictive.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hardly know}} what they'll think, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> {{will be very}} disagreeable, sir;--very disagreeable to my feelings. I did think, sir, that perhaps--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh! do {{not fear}} {{that you have}} been betrayed. No one says it; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> We future ambassadors, you know, have such {{extraordinary}} sources of information.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} divine {{of what he}} might be thinking; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a very disagreeable fact that at any moment we might fall into an ambush, for no man could say with {{certainty}} that the Indians had failed to note our coming.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lord, but I'd like to {{have seen}} that," [...] {{declared}} Smith vehemently. [...] "An' son, you got Jim Blake out of jail. Bill didn't hint you had anythin' to do with that. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> sure great. If only Jim does his part!" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{did seem}} incredible. Sam figured that no fish could run astern for {{two hundred yards}} and then quick as a flash break water abreast of us. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> true. Then the line slackened {{just as it had}} before. I began to wind up swiftly.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but he {{got himself}} mixed up in a divorce case. I forget the particulars, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was {{something}} very disagreeable. It was among artistic people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't <b>know</b> <b>I</b> long," [...] said Ethelbertha, [...] "to {{get away}} occasionally, even from you; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> can never be, so I do not brood upon it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{can hardly}} tell. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was! <b>I</b> feel {{perfectly}} certain it was--by {{the light in}} {{her eyes as she}} looked at me. She was a fleshy, coarse woman." ...|$|R
60|$|At this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat, {{and began}} running; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> no good running from a Martian, and I turned aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the broad ditch {{by the side}} of the road. He looked back, saw what I was doing, and turned to join me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I ask no questions, {{and have}} endeavoured so to train myself that I should care but little about it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so." [...] Then {{after a pause}} {{he went back to}} the current of his thoughts. [...] "Had my father been a prince I think that I should take no pride in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{had to put}} {{a strong}} {{constraint}} on myself, or I should have communicated all that was passing in my mind to William before our friends at the farmhouse. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> best to wait until we were alone, and I did wait. What a relief it was when we all got up at last to say good-night! ...|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the album}} sold well, it is Paddy Moloney's least {{favorite}} album. Moloney {{was quoted as}} saying, [...] "I don't know {{what they did to}} <b>it</b> technically, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> plays too fast!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I?" [...] said poor Proudfute. [...] "I do not {{remember}} <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> is my best point: I am a strong dog in the loins. But did they all see it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye <b>know</b> not, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> was a {{white people}} who were before ye are, who shall be when ye are not, who shall eat you up and destroy you. Yea! yea! yea! ...|$|R
60|$|Soon, however, I {{began to}} move a little faster. Somehow or other I became {{conscious}} {{that there was a}} bicycle at some distance behind me. I pushed on a little faster. I did not wish to be overtaken by anybody. Now I was sure there was a wheel behind me. I could not hear it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> there.|$|E
60|$|But Rectus did worry. I {{must have}} looked frightened when I came up, and I believe he had caught the scare. Boys will do that. The captain tried {{to keep me from}} going in again, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all {{nonsense}} to be frightened. I was going to bring up something from the bottom, if it was only a pebble.|$|E
60|$|It {{struck me}} to the heart {{when he told me}} this, for though it was most {{rational}} to think I would not deny him, yet I knew in my own conscience I must deny him, and I saw my ruin in my being obliged to do so; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my business to talk otherwise then, so I interrupted him in his story thus.|$|E
6000|$|... "You think you're honest, mother--but don't you see you've {{become an}} {{unconscious}} hypnotist? It's your subconscious self deceiving us both. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> {{how you do}} <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> must be a fraud." ...|$|R
6000|$|Think of the Soul; I {{swear to}} you that body of yours gives {{proportions}} to your Soul somehow to [...] live in other spheres; <b>I</b> do not <b>know</b> how, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> is so.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aunt Nancy! If it {{was anybody}} {{but you said}} such a thing! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know!</b> <b>It's</b> because you're so set on Hughey Blake. Hughey Blake!" [...] she ended scornfully, and {{went back into the}} cabin.|$|R
6000|$|I did {{not know}} what to say. I really liked him so much; and when he spoke in that voice, I could not bear to seem cruel to him. Indeed, I was aware at the moment how much I had grown to care for him in those six short days. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> impossible. 'Don't say it, Mr. Tillington,' I murmured, turning my face away. 'The less said, the sooner mended.' ...|$|E
60|$|Why, it {{was almost}} cruel the way those moldy {{veterans}} laughed; {{and as for the}} orator, he looked so flustered and helpless that almost anybody would have pitied him, and I had difficulty to keep from doing it myself. Yes, Joan was feeling very well after her rest, and the native mischief that was in her lay near the surface. It did not show when she made the remark, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> close in there back of the words.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I did tremble {{once in a}} while, when I {{thought of}} how hot Jimmy would be against me if he did get into a scrape, for by my hunting him up it looked a good deal as if I had quite a finger in the pie, {{whatever}} kind of pie it might be, though, as I've already said, I hadn't the littlest bit of an idea {{as to what was}} really in the wind, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> about time for things to begin to hum, especially if Slowly kept on doing his part as well as he had begun." ...|$|E
60|$|Pleasantly and well-suited I walk: Whither I walk <b>I</b> cannot define, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> is good; The whole {{universe}} {{indicates that it}} is good, The {{past and the present}} indicate that it is good.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to do that mantel for me," [...] she said. [...] "I don't know what you mean by 'low relief,' <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> would be up to these, and they are right!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> is. You're fit to cry {{just this}} minute, for nothing else but because you've sat still the whole day. It {{would make a}} kitten dull to be mewed up so." ...|$|R
