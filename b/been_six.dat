5|$|Following {{the end of}} the World Cup, the Queen's Park Oval has had a {{sporadic}} {{allotment of}} international cricket. Since 2007 there has <b>been</b> <b>six</b> (6) test matches the most recent of which was the infamous washed out match held in August 2016 against India. That match was notable for the third shortest non-abandoned test ever, with the match being curtailed by a wet outfield which allowed for only twenty two overs to be bowled over the five days despite rain not falling {{for the majority of the}} match.|$|E
5|$|Long {{duration}} {{missions to}} the ISS {{are referred to}} as ISS Expeditions. Expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the ISS. The initial expedition crew size was three, temporarily decreased to two following the Columbia disaster. Since May 2009, expedition crew size has <b>been</b> <b>six</b> crew members. Crew size is expected to be increased to seven, the number the ISS was designed for, once the Commercial Crew Program becomes operational. The ISS has been continuously occupied for the past , having exceeded the previous record held by Mir; and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations.|$|E
5|$|Since 1947, twenty-two {{people have}} been Chief Minister of Mysore (as the state was known before 1 November 1973) and Karnataka.

Devaraj Urs, held the office for over seven years in the 1970s. As a Janata Party member, Ramakrishna Hegde served the most number of discontinuous terms (three), while the Congress's Veerendra Patil had the largest gap between two terms (over eighteen years). One chief minister, H. D. Deve Gowda, {{went on to become}} the eleventh Prime Minister of India, while another, B. D. Jatti, served as the country's fifth Vice President.

5|$|The first Nobel Prize in Physics {{was awarded}} in 1901 to Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, of Germany, who {{received}} 150,782 SEK, which {{is equal to}} 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice—in 1956 and 1972. Maria Skłodowska-Curie also won two Nobel Prizes, for physics in 1903 and chemistry in 1911. William Lawrence Bragg was, until October 2014, the youngest ever Nobel laureate; he won the prize in 1915 {{at the age of}} 25. Two women have won the prize: Curie and Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963). As of 2017, the prize has been awarded to 206 individuals. There have <b>been</b> <b>six</b> years in which the Nobel Prize in Physics was not awarded (1916, 1931, 1934, 1940–1942).|$|E
5|$|The {{local police}} {{department}} {{reported that they}} received many tips suggesting possible identities for the child, those of missing girls throughout the country. Many readers online told police that the girl could be Aliya Lunsford of West Virginia, who disappeared on September 24, 2011. Lunsford would have <b>been</b> <b>six</b> {{at the time of}} the discovery and did bear a resemblance to the reconstruction of the Jane Doe, but she was later excluded from the case. The Massachusetts State Police later released statements on their Facebook pages regarding the exclusions of Lunsford, as well as Ayla Reynolds.|$|E
5|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} {{going into the}} Stakes over Secretariat's bid for the Triple Crown. Since 1948, when Citation achieved the feat, there had <b>been</b> <b>six</b> horses that had won both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes before failing in the Belmont Stakes. When comparing Secretariat to those six horses' health and fitness before the Belmont Stakes, writer Bonifice felt Secretariat {{was in the best}} shape, almost as good as when he entered the Kentucky Derby weeks prior. Just days before the Belmont, Secretariat ran five furlongs in just under a minute in a morning workout. Following that, Secretariat's jockey Ron Turcotte told reporters that Secretariat was ready for a top charge on Saturday.|$|E

5|$|Yellowstone {{experiences}} {{thousands of}} small earthquakes every year, virtually {{all of which are}} undetectable to people. There have <b>been</b> <b>six</b> earthquakes with at least magnitude 6 or greater in historical times, including the 7.5‑magnitude Hebgen Lake earthquake which occurred just outside the northwest boundary of the park in 1959. This quake triggered a huge landslide, which caused a partial dam collapse on Hebgen Lake; immediately downstream, the sediment from the landslide dammed the river and created a new lake, known as Earthquake Lake. Twenty-eight people were killed, and property damage was extensive in the immediate region. The earthquake caused some geysers in the northwestern section of the park to erupt, large cracks in the ground formed and emitted steam, and some hot springs that normally have clear water turned muddy. A 6.1‑magnitude earthquake struck inside the park on June 30, 1975, but damage was minimal.|$|E
5|$|Roberto Clemente and Willie Mays {{are tied}} for the most Gold Gloves won among outfielders; Clemente won 12 {{consecutive}} National League awards with the Pittsburgh Pirates, as did Mays with the New York and San Francisco Giants. Four outfielders are {{tied for the}} second-highest total with 10 wins: Jones, Ken Griffey, Jr., Al Kaline, and Ichiro Suzuki. There is one 9-time winner, Torii Hunter, who won his awards consecutively. There have <b>been</b> <b>six</b> 8-time winners (Barry Bonds, Evans, Paul Blair, Andre Dawson, Jim Edmonds, and Garry Maddox), and four 7-time awardees (Winfield, Curt Flood, Larry Walker, Devon White. Yastremski, Murphy and Kirby Puckett each won six American League awards; there have been seven 5-time winners and six 4-time winners as well. Darin Erstad won a Gold Glove as a first baseman in 2004 after winning two awards in the outfield (2000, 2002), making him the only player to win the award as an infielder and an outfielder.|$|E
5|$|Surcharges {{imposed by}} the Irish post office on mail bearing {{insufficient}} pre-paid postage had the postage due collected {{by the use of}} these labels. Since 1925 there have <b>been</b> <b>six</b> series printed, with the design remaining the same until 1980, though the colour and watermarks have changed. The Irish word pingin, for penny, is used in both £.s.d and decimal currency, but because it has the same meaning in each, the value on the label does not indicate whether the label was issued before or after decimalisation. Hence, identifying the issue of a label requires further information: if collectors knows the date of use, the existence of a watermark and if so which type, and the specific colour, identification will be easier. For example, the 3d value was blue between 1940 and 1969, and stone colour from 1971 until 1980; it changed from a watermarked to a non-watermark paper in 1978. Additionally, the 1, 5 and 8 pence values are seen in two different colours depending on the issue, while the d, 1d, 2d and 6d are seen with both watermark varieties. Except for the sixth issue, which has the word Éire in the design, there is no explicit country identity on any of the others. The first four series use only Irish words.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{positively}} received in both sales and popularity. Its original PlayStation 2 release {{sold more than}} 82,000 copies in its first week of release in Japan, and it was voted as the third best bishōjo game by the readers of Dengeki G's Magazine in 2007. It has since received several spin-off titles, including a sequel entitled To Heart 2 Another Days, which was released on February 29, 2008 for Windows, and has also made transitions to other media. There have <b>been</b> <b>six</b> anime adaptations of To Heart 2: an anime television adaptation produced by OLM's Team Iguchi, which was first broadcast in Japan between October 3, 2005 and January 2, 2006; and five original video animation series produced by Aquaplus and Chaos Project. Four manga series, fifteen sets of manga anthologies, three Internet radio shows, two drama CDs, and six novel adaptations based on To Heart 2 have also been produced.|$|E
5|$|There have <b>been</b> <b>six</b> {{business}} {{routes of}} Interstate 96 (I-96) in the US state of Michigan. There are two business loops designated Business Loop Interstate 96 (BL I-96): one through Lansing and one through Howell. Both follow the old route of US Highway16 (US16), with appropriate connections to I-96. There are three former business spurs that were designated Business Spur Interstate 96 (BS I-96). One {{connected to the}} carferry docks in Muskegon, running concurrently with part of Business US31 (Bus. US31) along former US16, {{but it has been}} eliminated. The second spur ran into downtown Portland until it was decommissioned in 2007. Two routes in the Detroit area—a loop through Farmington and a spur into Detroit—both using Grand River Avenue, and meeting at the temporary end of I-96 near Purdue Avenue, were eliminated when I-96 was moved to the completed Jeffries Freeway in 1977. These Detroit-area business routes are still state-maintained as unsigned highways.|$|E
5|$|There have <b>been</b> <b>six</b> {{official}} residences of Indiana's governors since Indiana {{became a}} state, but only five were actually inhabited {{by the first}} family. There were four other unofficial residences that governors also lived in while no other accommodations were available. The first residence of a state governor was in Corydon on a small hill overlooking the first statehouse; Governor Jonathan Jennings and his wife Anne lived in it from 1816 until 1822. The home was visited by United States Presidents Andrew Jackson and James Monroe. The building is no longer standing but a new home has been built upon its original foundation and uses its cellar as a basement. Governor William Hendricks also lived in Corydon at Governor Hendricks Headquarters, an unofficial residence purchased by Hendricks from Davis Floyd and located on the same block as Jennings' home. Floyd had built the home for himself, but lost it after the Panic of 1819. Hendricks lived there during his term as governor, from 18221825, and later sold it.|$|E

5000|$|The message [...] "John <b>is</b> <b>six</b> feet tall" [...] is an {{assertion}} involving truth that commits the speaker to its factuality, whereas the reified statement [...] "Mary reports that John <b>is</b> <b>six</b> feet tall" [...] defers such commitment to Mary. In this way, the statements can be incompatible without creating contradictions in reasoning. For example, the statements [...] "John <b>is</b> <b>six</b> feet tall" [...] and [...] "John is five feet tall" [...] are mutually exclusive (and thus incompatible), but the statements [...] "Mary reports that John <b>is</b> <b>six</b> feet tall" [...] and [...] "Paul reports that John is five feet tall" [...] are not incompatible, {{as they are}} both governed by a conclusive rationale that either Mary or Paul is (or both are), in fact, incorrect.|$|R
