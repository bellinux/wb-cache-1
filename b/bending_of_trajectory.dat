In this work the <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> <b>trajectories</b> <b>of</b> massive objects in a Schwarzschild spacetime {{and the corresponding}} gravitational lensing (GL) effects are studied. A particle sphere for Schwarzschild black hole (BH) is found with its radius a simple function of the particle velocity and proportional to the BH mass. A single master formula for both the massless and massive particle bending angle is found, {{in the form of}} an elliptic function depending only on the velocity and impact parameter. This bending angle is expanded in both large and small velocity limits and large and small impact parameter limits. The corresponding deflection angle for weak and strong GL of massive particles are analyzed, and their corrections to the light ray deflection angles are obtained. The dependence of the deflection angles on the source angle and the particle speed is investigated.

40|$|Even when {{neglecting}} diffraction effects, {{the well-known}} equations of geometrical optics (GO) {{are not entirely}} accurate. Traditional GO treats wave rays as classical particles, which are completely described by their coordinates and momenta, but vector-wave rays have another degree of freedom, namely, their polarization. The polarization degree of freedom manifests itself as an effective (classical) "wave spin" that can be assigned to rays and can affect the wave dynamics accordingly. A well-known manifestation of polarization dynamics is mode conversion, which is the linear exchange of quanta between different wave modes and {{can be interpreted as}} a rotation of the wave spin. Another, less-known polarization effect is the polarization-driven <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> ray <b>trajectories.</b> This work presents an extension and reformulation of GO as a first-principle Lagrangian theory, whose effective-gauge Hamiltonian governs the aforementioned polarization phenomena simultaneously. As an example, the theory is applied to describe the polarization-driven divergence of right-hand and left-hand circularly polarized electromagnetic waves in weakly magnetized plasma.

40|$|Linear vector waves, both quantum and classical, {{experience}} polarization-driven <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> ray <b>trajectories</b> and polarization {{dynamics that}} {{can be interpreted as}} the precession of the "wave spin". Both phenomena are governed by an effective gauge Hamiltonian, which vanishes in leading-order geometrical optics. This gauge Hamiltonian can be recognized as a generalization of the Stern-Gerlach Hamiltonian that is commonly known for spin- 1 / 2 quantum particles. The corresponding reduced Lagrangians for continuous nondissipative waves and their geometrical-optics rays are derived from the fundamental wave Lagrangian. The resulting Euler-Lagrange equations can describe simultaneous interactions of $N$ resonant modes, where $N$ is arbitrary, and lead to equations for the wave spin, which happens to be a $(N^ 2 - 1) $-dimensional spin vector. As a special case, classical equations for a Dirac particle $(N= 2) $ are deduced formally, without introducing additional postulates or interpretations, from the Dirac quantum Lagrangian with the Pauli term. The model reproduces the Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equations with added Stern-Gerlach force. Comment: 17 page...|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} of electromagnetic waves in isotropic dielectric media with local dispersion is studied {{under the assumption}} of small but nonvanishing λ/l, where λ is the wavelength, and l is the characteristic inhomogeneity scale. It is commonly known that, due to nonzero λ/l, such waves can experience polarization-driven <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> ray <b>trajectories</b> and polarization dynamics that {{can be interpreted as}} the precession of the wave "spin". The present work reports how Lagrangians describing these effects can be deduced, rather than guessed, within a strictly classical theory. In addition to the commonly known ray Lagrangian featuring the Berry connection, a simple alternative Lagrangian is proposed that naturally has a canonical form. The presented theory captures not only eigenray dynamics but also the dynamics of continuous wave fields and rays with mixed polarization, or "entangled" waves. The calculation assumes stationary lossless media with isotropic local dispersion, but generalizations to other media are straightforward to do. Comment: 9 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

40|$|Using {{idealized}} {{models of}} the accretion disk we investigate the relativistic effects on the energy deposition rate via neutrino pair annihilation near the rotation axis of a Kerr black hole. Neutrinos are emitted from the accretion disk. The <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> neutrino <b>trajectories</b> and the redshift due to the disk rotation and gravitation are taken into consideration. The Kerr parameter, $a$, affects not only neutrinos' behavior but also the inner radius of the accretion disk. When the deposition energy is mainly contributed by the neutrinos coming from the central part, the redshift effect becomes dominant as $a$ becomes large and the energy deposition rate is reduced compared with that neglecting the relativistic effects. On the other hand, for small $a$ the bending effect gets dominant and makes energy increase by factor 2 compared with that neglecting the relativistic effects. For the disk with temperature gradient, the energy deposition rate for a small inner radius of the accretion disk is smaller than that estimated by neglecting the relativistic effects. The relativistic effects, especially for large $a$, play a negative role in avoiding the baryon contamination problem in gamma-ray bursts. Comment: 19 pages, 5 figures. ApJ 546 in pres...|$|R
40|$|If a pulsar orbits a {{supermassive black}} hole, {{the timing of}} pulses that pass close to the hole will show a variety of strong field effects. To compute the {{intensity}} and timing of pulses that have passed close to a nonrotating black hole we introduce here a simple formalism based on two "universal functions," one for the <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> photon <b>trajectories</b> {{and the other for}} the photon travel time on these trajectories. We apply this simple formalism to the case of a pulsar in circular orbit that beams its pulses into the orbital plane. In addition to the "primary" pulses that reach the receiver by a more-or-less direct path, we find that there are secondary and higher order pulses. These are usually much dimmer than the primary pulses, but they can be of comparable or even greater intensity if they are emitted when pulsar {{is on the side of}} the hole furthest from the receiver. We show that there is a phase relationship of the primary and secondary pulses that is a probe of the strongly curved spacetime geometry. Analogs of these phenomena are expected in more general configurations, in which a pulsar in orbit around a hole emits pulses that are not confined to the orbital plane.

40|$|We {{consider}} a two-dimensional model of inflation, where the inflationary trajectory is "deformed" by a grazing encounter with an Extra Species/Symmetry Point (ESP) after the observable cosmological scales {{have left the}} Hubble radius. The encounter entails a sudden production of particles, whose backreaction causes a <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trajectory</b> and a temporary decrease in speed, {{both of which are}} sensitive to initial conditions. This "modulated" effect leads to an additional contribution to the curvature perturbation, which can be dominant if the encounter is close. We compute associated non-Gaussianities, the bispectrum and its scale dependence as well as the trispectrum, which are potentially detectable in many cases. In addition, we {{consider a}} direct modulation of the coupling to the light field at the ESP via a modulaton field, a mixed scenario whereby the modulaton is identified with a second inflaton, and an extended Extra Species Locus (ESL); all of these scenarios lead to similar additional contributions to observables. We conclude that inflaton interactions throughout inflation are strongly constrained if primordial non-Gaussianities remain unobserved in current experiments such as PLANCK. If they are observed, an ESP encounter leaves additional signatures on smaller scales which may be used to identify the model.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{localization}} properties of two-dimensional electrons {{in a weak}} perpendicular magnetic field. For this purpose we construct weakly chiral network models on the square and triangular lattices, by separating in space the regions with phase action of magnetic field, where it affects interference in course of disorder scattering, and the regions with orbital action of magnetic field, where it bends electron trajectories. In our models, the disorder mixes counter-propagating channels on the links, while scattering at the nodes describes the <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> electron <b>trajectories.</b> By introducing a strong spread in the scattering strengths on the links, we eliminate the interference and reduce the electron propagation over a network to a percolation problem. In this limit we establish {{the form of the}} disorder vs. magnetic field phase diagram, which is in agreement with levitation scenario: energy separating the Anderson and quantum Hall insulating phases floats up to infinity upon decreasing magnetic field. From numerical study we conclude that the positions of the weak-field quantum Hall transitions on the phase diagram are very close to our percolation results.
