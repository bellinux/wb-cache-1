25|$|This {{argument}} is advanced by Sunni Muslims that Muhammad's companion Abu Bakr {{was elected by}} the community, {{and this was the}} proper procedure.

25|$|Their biggest {{test in the}} Championship came against Kerry in the semi-final. This was {{the first}} time Tyrone had met Kerry in the Championship since the All-Ireland Final in 1986. Many pundits <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> Tyrone's {{definitive}} display of 2003. They deployed a 'blanket defence,' whereby as soon as they lost possession of the ball, all players were ready to win it back. Kerry players, from the full-back line to the forwards, found themselves harried by three or four players around them every time they got the ball, meaning they were under pressure for space, and time to release the ball. Detractors (famously, Pat Spillane, himself a Kerry player from the 1986 final) called this style 'puke football' because it stifled the flow of the game of Gaelic football. It was extremely effective however, and the 0–13 to 0–6 scoreline that Tyrone won by was flattering for Kerry.|$|E

500|$|In 1982, Madonna {{was working}} with {{producer}} Reggie Lucas on her debut album. She had already composed three songs, when Lucas brought {{one of his own}} compositions to the project, calling it [...] "Borderline". However, after recording the song, Madonna was unhappy with the final version. According to her, Lucas used too many instruments and did not consider her ideas for the song. This led to a dispute between the two. After finishing the album, Lucas left the project without altering the songs to Madonna's specifications. Hence, Madonna brought her then boyfriend John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez to remix [...] "Borderline" [...] and two other recorded tracks. On hearing the final version, Seymour Stein, head of Sire Records declared, [...] "I dared to <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> going to be huge beyond belief, the biggest thing I'd ever had, after I heard 'Borderline'... The passion that she put into that song, I thought, there's no stopping this girl." ...|$|E
500|$|The black {{nationalist}} movement regarded Beadle {{as a white}} supremacist, pointing to his 1959 preventive detention ruling as evidence. Wilson and other British figures saw him as two-faced for first supporting Gibbs, then declaring Smith's post-UDI government legal, {{and concluded that the}} judge must have always been a furtive UDI supporter, a theory that many have accepted. Wilson's private assistant Marcia Falkender identified Beadle as [...] "the villain of the piece", while Bottomley dubbed him UDI's [...] "evil genius". Others, including Palley, Wood and Facchini, contend that Beadle was determined to avert UDI and afterwards sincere in his search for an accommodation until he came to <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not possible. [...] "Beadle accepted the rebellion when he realised that he was identifying himself with 'the code of an Empire that had ceased to exist'," [...] Facchini concludes.

500|$|However, Doctor Who fandom's initial {{response}} to the serial was not so positive; John Peel, writing in the fanzine TARDIS in 1979, decried it as [...] "total farce... I simply couldn't <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> Doctor Who... the continual buffoonery is getting on my nerves". A similar view was held by Gary Russell who, reviewing the VHS release in 1991, said, [...] "City of Death, like most Douglas Adams material, is overrated and misses the mark for me, falling between the stools of good pastiche and bad parody and making fairly unsatisfactory viewing". This line was countered by Vanessa Bishop who called it [...] "the Doctor Who story it's alright to laugh at... we must now accept that City of Death is funny— because if we didn't the Crackerjack-style sleuths, scientists and all... would leave it knocking about {{near the bottom of}} all the Doctor Who story ranking polls" [...] and, responding to the criticisms about the levels of comedy, that [...] "it's precisely these things that make it seem so special". Reviewing the serial in 2011, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times stated he disliked the smug tone to the humour and Ward's [...] "snooty" [...] portrayal of Romana. Despite this, he noted that the serial had good production values and direction, as well as a few jokes that he enjoyed.|$|E
500|$|Hutton rarely captained Yorkshire, {{except in}} the absence of the {{official}} captain, through a combination of poor health, frequent absences with England and the presence of the amateur Norman Yardley in the side. Yardley claimed several times that he would have stood down in Hutton's favour, but the committee remained distrustful of professional captaincy and thought Hutton a hypochondriac who used his health as an excuse not to play. Hutton was a reserved man for whom the Yorkshire dressing room clashes of the 1950s held little appeal. As the side's senior professional, he did not always provide the guidance which younger players in the side were seeking. The team was divided and the players frequently clashed with each other; some critics <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a factor in the county's failure to win the County Championship in the 1950s. Ray Illingworth, a player at the time, believes that Hutton was the only man who could have changed the negative attitude around the team, but [...] "he didn't do anything about it". Illingworth recalled that he was a [...] "distant hero", saying: [...] "He was a funny man was Len—slightly sarcastic all the time. He'd hear an argument in the dressing room and he'd throw a bit of wood on the fire to keep it going. He looked after himself, he was very much of a loner." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first notable {{change to}} this {{was caused by}} the Parliament of Northern Ireland's {{decision}} to introduce internment.
