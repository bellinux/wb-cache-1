5|$|In 1945, the <b>Butoku</b> Kai {{promoted}} Abbe to 7th dan in judo and 6th dan in kendo. Following {{the end of}} World War II, {{however, the}} <b>Butoku</b> Kai and Busen were both closed down. Abbe took up {{the position of a}} judo teacher for the Kyoto Prefectural Police Department. He became Chief Instructor of judo for the Kyoto police, and also taught at Doshisha University in that city. After the Abbes had a third daughter, Yayoi, Abbe resigned from the Kyoto police. During this period, he felt that judo in Japan was declining, and ended his association with the Kodokan in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Following {{graduation}} from Busen, Abbe became an instructor in judo at the college, {{as well as}} taking instructor positions with the Osaka police force and {{a high school in}} Kyoto. The <b>Butoku</b> Kai promoted him to 6th dan in judo in 1937.|$|E
5|$|After these events, Ueshiba {{seemed to}} slowly grow away from Takeda, {{and he began}} to change his art. These changes are {{reflected}} in the differing names with which he referred to his system, first as aiki-jūjutsu, then Ueshiba-ryū, Asahi-ryū, and aiki budō. In 1942, when Ueshiba's group joined the Dai Nippon <b>Butoku</b> Kai, the martial art that Ueshiba developed finally {{came to be known as}} aikido.|$|E
5|$|At his 1st dan judo examination, Abbe {{had caught}} the {{attention}} of Shotaro Tobata from the <b>Butoku</b> Kai, who had been refereeing at the event. Tobata had suggested to Nakamoto and Abbe that the young man should apply for entry to the renowned Budo Senmon Gakko (abbreviated to 'Busen,' and sometimes referred to as 'Busen College'), a specialist college for martial artists. With the additional help of a teacher named Nakano, Abbe now prepared for the entrance examination in Kyoto. Out of all the candidates, of which there were around 300 that year, 20 would be accepted into the judo programme and 20 into the kendo programme. Abbe performed well and was accepted into both programmes.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Abbe began {{learning}} judo from Kazohira Nakamoto, {{a former}} police officer. That same year, {{he was promoted to}} the rank of 1st dan in the art and, unusually, he reached 2nd dan the next year, and 3rd dan the year after that. Thus, at the age of 16, he became the youngest judo student ever promoted to 3rd dan—an honour he received directly from Shohei Hamano, an instructor of the Dai Nippon <b>Butoku</b> Kai (abbreviated to 'Butoku Kai' or 'Butokukwai'), which was the official governing body for Japanese martial arts. Abbe also became champion of the Tokushima High School Judo League that year. During his fifth year at the school, Abbe entered a regional tournament involving 30 towns, serving as captain for the team from the town of Kawashima. His speed and agility helped him to many victories, and he received the nickname 'Pegasus' accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Dai Nippon <b>Butoku</b> Kai (DNBK), {{established}} in 1895 in Kyoto, approved and recognized the discipline iaido.|$|E
25|$|Other organisations {{that promote}} {{the study of}} Japanese martial arts, {{including}} kendo, are the Dai Nippon <b>Butoku</b> Kai (DNBK) and the International Martial Arts Federation (IMAF). The current DNBK has no connection to the pre-war organisation, although it shares the same goals. The International Martial Arts Federation (IMAF) was established in Kyoto in 1952 and {{is dedicated to the}} promotion and development of the martial arts worldwide, including kendo.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century Uchida Ryogoro arrived in Tokyo {{and set up}} shop, {{teaching}} jōjutsu to high-rankers in the Japanese society at the time. His students included Nakayama Hakudo (1873–1958), founder of Muso Shinden-ryū, and Komita Takayoshi, founder of the Dai Nippon <b>Butoku</b> Kai ("Great Japan Budō Preservation Society"). It was during this time that Jigoro Kano was first invited to Fukuoka to observe SMR which would herald the cooperation between the two arts in Tokyo. Uchida Ryogoro also taught at the Naval Officers Club and later at the Shiba Kōen park. Ryogoro's son, Uchida Ryōhei, joined him in Tokyo and studied under his father there and was instrumental in developing his father's Tanjōjutsu art into a working set of techniques. Uchida Ryogoro died in 1921. Uchidas efforts in Tokyo greatly assisted in establishing a connection with the various martial arts communities already based in Tokyo and would help {{pave the way to}} Shimizu Takajis own efforts at popularizing SMR and establishing a new SMR presence.|$|E
25|$|Funakoshi {{changed the}} names of many kata {{and the name of}} the art itself (at least on {{mainland}} Japan), doing so to get karate accepted by the Japanese budō organization Dai Nippon <b>Butoku</b> Kai. Funakoshi also gave Japanese names to many of the kata. The five pinan forms became known as heian, the three naihanchi forms became known as tekki, seisan as hangetsu, Chintō as gankaku, wanshu as enpi, and so on. These were mostly political changes, rather than changes to the content of the forms, although Funakoshi did introduce some such changes. Funakoshi had trained in two of the popular branches of Okinawan karate of the time, Shorin-ryū and Shōrei-ryū. In Japan he was influenced by kendo, incorporating some ideas about distancing and timing into his style. He always referred to what he taught as simply karate, but in 1936 he built a dojo in Tokyo and the style he left behind is usually called Shotokan after this dojo.|$|E
500|$|In {{his later}} years Sakakibara {{returned}} to coach and train in his dojo in Kurumazaka, after trying his hand unsuccessfully at running a [...] theatre and an [...] (bar). [...] Those who trained at the Kurumazaka dojo included Naitō Takaharu, who was to become head of the Dai Nippon <b>Butoku</b> Kai, and foreigners such as Austrian ambassador and fencing expert Heinrich von Siebold, and German Erwin Bälz, physician to the Japanese Imperial Family. Takeda Sōkaku, the founder of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu, also studied with Sakakibara at Kurumazaka.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Japanese feudal system in 1868 the founders of the modern disciplines borrowed from the theory and the practice of classical disciplines as they had studied or practiced. The founding in 1895 of the Dai Nippon <b>Butoku</b> Kai (DNBK) 大日本武徳会 (lit. [...] "Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society") in Kyoto, Japan. was also an important contribution to the development of modern Japanese swordsmanship. In 1932 DNBK officially approved and recognized the Japanese discipline, iaido; this year {{was the first time the}} term iaido appeared in Japan. After this initiative the modern forms of swordsmanship is organised in several iaido organisations. [...] During the post-war occupation of Japan, the Dai Nippon <b>Butoku</b> Kai and its affiliates were disbanded by the Allies of World War II in the period 1945–1950. However, in 1950, the Dai Nippon <b>Butoku</b> Kai was reestablished and the practice of the Japanese martial disciplines began again.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two years}} that define the way Gōjū-ryū has been {{considered}} by the Japanese establishment: the first, 1933, is the year Gōjū-ryū was officially recognized as a budō in Japan by the DNBK Dai Nippon <b>Butoku</b> Kai, in other words, it was recognized as a modern martial art, or gendai budō by the Japanese Government. The second year, 1998, is the year the semi-governmental Nippon Kobudo Kyokai (Japan Traditional Martial Arts Association), under the Cultural Ministry of Japan, recognized Gōjū-ryū Karate-do as an ancient form of traditional martial art (koryū) and as a bujutsu. This recognition as a koryū bujutsu shows a change in how Japanese society sees the relationships between Japan, Okinawa and China.|$|E
2500|$|In English, {{the modern}} {{official}} {{title of the}} country is simply [...] "Japan", one of the few nation-states to have no [...] "long form" [...] name. The official Japanese-language name is Nippon koku or Nihon koku (日本国), literally [...] "State of Japan". From the Meiji Restoration until the end of World War II, the full title of Japan was the [...] "Empire of Greater Japan" [...] (大日本帝國 Dai Nippon Teikoku). [...] A more poetic rendering of the name of Japan during this period was [...] "Empire of the Sun." [...] The official name of the nation was changed after the adoption of the post-war constitution; the title [...] "State of Japan" [...] is sometimes used as a colloquial modern-day equivalent. As an adjective, the term [...] "Dai-Nippon" [...] remains popular with Japanese governmental, commercial, or social organizations whose reach extend beyond Japan's geographic borders (e.g., Dai Nippon Printing, Dai Nippon <b>Butoku</b> Kai, etc.).|$|E
2500|$|... is a vitally {{important}} aspect of judo. In 1899, Kano was asked to chair a committee of the Dai Nippon <b>Butoku</b> Kai to draw up the first formal set of contest rules for jujutsu. These rules were intended to cover contests between different various traditional schools of jujutsu as well as practitioners of Kodokan judo. Contests were 15 minutes long and were judged {{on the basis of}} nage waza and katame waza, excluding atemi waza. Wins were by two ippons, awarded in every four-main different path of winning alternatives, by [...] "Throwing", where the opponent's back strikes flat onto the mat with sufficient force, by [...] "Pinning" [...] them on their back for a [...] "sufficient" [...] amount of time, or by Submission, which could be achieved via [...] "Shime-waza" [...] or [...] "Kansetsu-waza", in which the opponent was forced to give himself or herself up or summon a referee's or corner-judge's stoppage. Finger, toe and ankle locks were prohibited. In 1900, these rules were adopted by the Kodokan with amendments made to prohibit all joint locks for kyu grades and added wrist locks to the prohibited kansetsu-waza for dan grades. It was also stated that the ratio of tachi-waza to ne-waza should be between 70% to 80% for kyu grades and 60% to 70% for dan grades.|$|E
