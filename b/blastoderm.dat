5|$|In this section, Heilmann draws {{evidence}} from his observations of germ cells, impregnation, cell division, ontogeny and comparative embryology about the probable ancestry of birds. A {{fair amount of}} detail is devoted early in the section to comparative studies between the germ cells of many different species of extant bird and reptile (and several mammals), including some comments on the corkscrew locomotion observed in the spermatozoa cells of several bird and reptile species, but no mammals. He {{then goes on to}} offer a similar comparison between the egg cells of birds and reptiles, and finds considerably more similarity there than either has to the egg cell of a mammal. Following an analysis of the germ cells, he moves onward through the developmental cycle by next examining the process of fertilization and subsequent cleavage of the zygote. He presents here several figures and illustrations of the cleavage of the <b>blastoderm</b> in reptiles and birds.|$|E
25|$|Gap Junctions {{have been}} {{observed}} in various animal organs and tissues where cells contact each other. From the 1950s to 1970s they were detected in crayfish nerves, rat pancreas, liver, adrenal cortex, epididymis, duodenum, muscle, Daphnia hepatic caecum, Hydra muscle, monkey retina, rabbit cornea, fish <b>blastoderm,</b> frog embryos, rabbit ovary, re-aggregating cells, cockroach hemocyte capsules, rabbit skin, chick embryos, human islet of Langerhans, goldfish and hamster pressure sensing acoustico-vestibular receptors, lamprey and tunicate heart, rat seminiferous tubules, myometrium, eye lens and cephalopod digestive epithelium. Since the 1970s gap junctions have continued {{to be found in}} nearly all animal cells that touch each other. By the 1990s new technology such as confocal microscopy allowed more rapid survey of large areas of tissue. Since the 1970s even tissues that were traditionally considered to possibly have isolated cells such as bone showed that the cells were still connected with gap junctions, however tenuously. Gap junctions appear to be in all animal organs and tissues and {{it will be interesting to}} find exceptions to this other than cells not normally in contact with neighboring cells. Adult skeletal muscle is a possible exception. It may be argued that if present in skeletal muscle, gap junctions might propagate contractions in an arbitrary way among cells making up the muscle. At least in some cases this may not be the case as shown in other muscle types that do have gap junctions. An indication of what results from reduction or absence of gap junctions may be indicated by analysis of cancers or the aging process.|$|E
500|$|Like other {{stingray}}s, the bluntnose stingray is aplacental viviparous. {{with the}} embryos initially sustained by yolk. Later in development, finger-like {{extensions of the}} uterine epithelium called [...] "trophonemata" [...] surround the embryo and deliver protein and lipid-rich histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Only the left ovary and uterus in adult females are functional. Mating occurs during a well-defined period from April to June, peaking in May, with the males presumably using their pointed teeth to grasp the females for copulation. However, embryonic development halts at the <b>blastoderm</b> stage, shortly after {{the formation of the}} zygote, and does not resume for approximately ten months. In the spring of the following year, the embryos rapidly mature over a period of 10–12 weeks. This period of embryonic diapause may reflect the greater availability of food in the spring.|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{parthenogenetic}} development in turkey eggs, many <b>blastoderms</b> are mosaics of haploid, diploid and polyploid cells. The genome composition of these <b>blastoderms</b> can be identified by C-banding. They may be generally described as either A-Z/ 2 A-ZZ/nA-nZ or A-W/ 2 A-WW/nA-nW and are found in a nearly 1 : 1 ratio. The <b>blastoderms</b> showing the W body (W+) become lethal within two days of incubation. The haploid cell proportion decreases rapidly during the early stage of development, and, as haploid cells decrease, the proportion of polyploid cells appears to increase. At six days of incubation, various kinds of parthenogenetic development can be observed. Their genome compositions are either diploid (2 A-ZZ) or mosaic (A-Z/ 2 A-ZZ). These findings suggest that diploid parthenogenesis occurs by either suppression of meiosis II or chromosome doubling some time after the first cleavage division. The frequent occurrence of mosaic <b>blastoderms</b> indicates that the majority, if not all, of the parthenogenetic embryos initiate their development in haploid ova...|$|R

2500|$|Although the Wolbachia {{infection}} is prevalent in arthropod species, especially the Asian tiger mosquito, it {{is a useful}} mechanism for inhibiting the spread of dengue. Ae. aegypti individuals, a close relative of Ae. albopictus, with an artificial Wolbachia infection, cannot transmit dengue, an infectious virus, but they can pass on the Wolbachia infection to other populations. This could lead to many more discoveries in disease control for Ae. albopictus and other mosquito species. In addition, due to the cytoplasmic incompatibility caused by Wolbachia, [...] the artificial infection of males {{can serve as a}} biological control as they are unable to reproduce successfully with uninfected females (unidirectional CI). When artificially infected males are unable to reproduce, the population size can be controlled, thereby reducing the transmission of the harmful disease of interest. Artificial infection of males is achieved by the removal of cytoplasm from infected oocytes, which is then transferred into embryos prior to the <b>blastoderm</b> stage.|$|E

40|$|Effects {{of insulin}} upon glucose {{metabolism}} were investigated in chick embryos explanted in vitro {{during the first}} 30 h of incubation. Insulin stimulated the glucose consumption of the chick gastrula (18 h) and neurula (24 h), but {{had no effect on}} the late blastula (0 h:laying) and on the stage of six to eight somites (30 h). The increase in glucose consumption concerned both the embryonic area pellucida (AP) and extraembryonic area opaca (AO). AP responded to a greater extent (50 %) and at a lower range of concentrations (0. 1 - 1. 0 ng/ml) than AO (30 %; 1 - 100 ng/ml). Insulin had no effect on the oxygen consumption of <b>blastoderms,</b> whereas it stimulated the aerobic lactate production (approximately 70 % of the additional glucose consumption was converted to lactate). The nanomolar range of stimulating concentrations suggests that insulin has a specific effect in the chick embryo, and that it could modulate glucose metabolism in ovo as well. The transient sensitivity of the embryo to insulin is discussed in relation to behavior of mesodermal cells...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{methods of}} avian {{transgenesis}} involve complex manipulations involving either retroviral infection of <b>blastoderms</b> or the ex vivo manipulation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) followed by injection {{of the cells}} back into a recipient embryo. Unlike in mammalian systems, avian embryonic PGCs undergo a migration through the vasculature on their path to the gonad where they become the sperm or ova producing cells. In a development which simplifies the procedure of creating transgenic chickens we have shown that PGCs are directly transfectable in vivo using commonly available transfection reagents. We used Lipofectamine 2000 complexed with Tol 2 transposon and transposase plasmids to stably transform PGCs in vivo generating transgenic offspring that express a reporter gene carried in the transposon. The process {{has been shown to}} be highly effective and as robust as the other methods used to create germ-line transgenic chickens while substantially reducing time, infrastructure and reagents required.

40|$|Pluripotent Embryonic Stem cell (ESC) lines can {{be derived}} from a variety of sources. Mouse lines derived from the early {{blastocyst}} and from primordial germ cells (PGCs) can contribute to all somatic lineages and to the germ line, whereas cells from slightly later embryos (EpiSC) no longer contribute to the germ line. In chick, pluripotent ESCs can be obtained from PGCs and from early <b>blastoderms.</b> Established PGC lines and freshly isolated blastodermal cells (cBC) can contribute to both germinal and somatic lineages but established lines from the former (cESC) can only produce somatic cell types.

40|$|Although {{tetraploid}} {{is important}} for the mass production of sterile triploids by hybridizing with diploid, its survival capacity is extremely low. In this study, we aimed to identify the cause of such a high mortality of embryos treated with hydrostatic pressure shock (700 kg/cm^ 2, 7 min duration, 5 - 7 h after fertilization at 10 ℃ in masu salmon. In treated eggs, cleavage rates were delayed and aberrant cell divisions were observed during the early cleavage stage. Histological observation in the blastula stage revealed frequent occurrence of aberrant <b>blastoderms</b> including anuclear and/or small blastomeres. Ploidy analysis of eyed and hatching embryos revealed successful production of pure tetraploid individuals. However tetraploid survivors exhibited abnormal appearances. In the groups treated at 6. 5 and 7 h, no embryonic body was observed at hatching stage. Judging from the results of each treated group, the optimum timing for the inhibition of first cleavage was 6 h after fertilization, when the eggs were cytologically staged as prometaphase to metaphase of the first cleavage. Aneuploids and mosaics were also detected in treated embryos by flow cytometry. These results suggest that abnormal cleavage and blastomeres mosaicism caused by the treatment at the first cleavage give rise to high mortality. 染色体操作において第一卵割阻止処理胚の生残率は極端に低いことが知られている。本研究では四倍体誘起個体が死亡する原因を細胞学的に解明することを目的とした。通常受精後 10 ℃の水温条件下で培養し,第一卵割を阻止する目的で受精後 5 時間から 7 時間に, 700 kg/cm^ 2, 7 分間の圧力処理を施した。処理胚では,初期卵割期に分裂異常,胞胚期に無核細胞,発眼期に異数体およびモザイク個体の出現が認められた。これらの異常胚出現が四倍体誘起胚の生残率を低下させる原因であると考えられた...|$|R

To achieve adequate sensitivity and localize spatially the receptors in younger embryos, we adapted an autoradiographic technique using whole-mounted chicken <b>blastoderms.</b> Insulin receptors and IGF-I receptors were expressed and could be localized as early as gastrulation, before the first somite is formed. Relative density was analyzed by a computer-assisted image system, revealing overall slightly higher binding of IGF-I than of insulin. Structures rich in both types of receptors were predominantly of ectodermal origin: Hensen's node in gastrulating embryos and neural folds, neural tube and optic vesicles during neurulation. The signal transduction capability of the receptors in early organogenesis was assessed by their ability to phosphorylate the exogenous substrate poly(Glu 80 Tyr 20). Ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation was demonstrable with both insulin and IGF-I in glycoprotein-enriched preparations from embryos at days 2 through 6 of embryogenesis. There was a developmentally regulated change in ligand-dependent tyrosine kinase activity, with a sharp increase from day 2 to day 4, in contrast with a small increase in the ligand binding.

40|$|Protein {{phosphatase}}- 1 (PP 1) {{is a major}} Ser/Thr phosphatase conserved {{among all}} eukaryotes, present as the essential GLC 7 gene in yeast. Inhibitor- 2 (I- 2) is an ancient PP 1 regulator, named GLC 8 in yeast, but its in vivo function is unknown. Unlike mammals with multiple I- 2 genes, in Drosophila {{there is a single}} I- 2 gene, and here we describe its maternally derived expression and required function during embryogenesis. During oogenesis, germline expression of I- 2 results in the accumulation of RNA and abundant protein in unfertilized eggs; in embryos, the endogenous I- 2 protein concentrates around condensed chromosomes during mitosis and also surrounds interphase nuclei. An I- 2 loss-of-function genotype is associated with a maternal-effect phenotype that results in drastically reduced progeny viability, as measured by reduced embryonic hatch rates and larval lethality. Embryos derived from I- 2 mutant mothers show faulty chromosome segregation and loss of mitotic synchrony in cleavage-stage embryos, patchy loss of nuclei in syncytial <b>blastoderms,</b> and cuticular pattern defects in late-stage embryos. Transgenic expression of wild-type I- 2 in mutant mothers gives dose-dependent rescue of the maternal effect on embryo hatch rate.

In addition, applicable modeling tools to investigate the underlying mechanisms of PKD are still lacking. The combination of disease-specific human {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) and directed cell differentiation offers an ideal platform for disease modeling. In this study, we generated two iPSC lines from the renal epithelial cells of one PKD patient with the hotspot c. 649 dupC mutation (PKD-iPSCs).
