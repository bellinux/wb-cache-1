5|$|As these larger water {{droplets}} descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens {{most often in}} clouds above freezing, and {{is also known as}} the warm rain process. In clouds <b>below</b> <b>freezing,</b> when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring {{water droplets}}. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is <b>below</b> <b>freezing.</b> In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.|$|E
5|$|Inconsistencies in the {{official}} accounts of Scott's death have been cited in conspiracy theories, which suggest that Scott died of a heroin overdose, or was killed by exhaust fumes redirected into the car, or that Kinnear did not exist. Additionally, Scott was asthmatic, and the temperature was <b>below</b> <b>freezing</b> {{on the morning of}} his death.|$|E
40|$|We {{explored}} {{the role of}} the water vapor content <b>below</b> the <b>freezing</b> level in the response of idealized supercell storm electrical processes to increased concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with parameterizations electrification and discharging, we performed 30 simulations by varying both the CCN concentration and water vapor content <b>below</b> the <b>freezing</b> level. The sensitivity simulations showed a distinct response to increased concentrations of CCN, depending on the water vapor content <b>below</b> the <b>freezing</b> level. Enhancing CCN concentrations increased electrification processes of thunderstorms and produced a new negative charge region above the main positive charge center when there were ample amounts of water vapor <b>below</b> the <b>freezing</b> level. Conversely, there were weak effects on electrification and the charge structure in numerical experiments initialized with lower water vapor content <b>below</b> the <b>freezing</b> level...|$|R
50|$|Supercooling {{is often}} {{confused}} with freezing-point depression. Supercooling is the cooling of a liquid <b>below</b> its <b>freezing</b> point without it becoming solid. Freezing point depression {{is when a}} solution can be cooled <b>below</b> the <b>freezing</b> point of the corresponding pure liquid due {{to the presence of}} the solute; an example of this is the freezing point depression that occurs when sodium chloride is added to pure water.|$|R
50|$|Third, the {{icephobic}} surfaces should repel incoming small droplets (e.g., of rain or fog) at {{the temperatures}} <b>below</b> the <b>freezing</b> point.|$|R
5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow {{on the roof and}} freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches <b>below</b> <b>freezing</b> temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{outbreak}} {{was related}} to a large low-pressure system across the central United States that intensified on February28 while over Kansas, and a cold front moved across the region, providing the lift needed to allow the storms to develop. In addition, a surge of very moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and warm temperatures across {{the south side of}} the storm helped feed the storms. Temperatures were in the 70s°F (low 20s°C) in some areas to the south, while the mercury was <b>below</b> <b>freezing</b> on the north side. The dewpoints were in the 60°F (16°C) range as far north as southeastern Kansas, which provided extra fuel.|$|E
5|$|As some warmer air {{began to}} move in above the surface, the snow mixed with and changed to sleet and {{freezing}} rain between 6 PM and 7 PM EST on the 13th in Philadelphia and Delaware Counties, then between 7 PM and 11 PM across most other areas in eastern Pennsylvania. The southern Poconos saw less mixed precipitation, however {{there was a period}} of mixed precipitation between about 7:30 PM on the 13th and 11:30 AM on the 14th. For a brief time during the afternoon of the 14th, temperatures rose a couple of degrees above freezing with no precipitation falling. Temperatures then dropped <b>below</b> <b>freezing</b> again by the late afternoon of the 14th with a period of snow before the precipitation came to an end between 8:30 PM and 10 PM on the 14th. Wraparound snow showers lingered in Monroe and Carbon Counties until 2 AM EST on the 15th.|$|E

5|$|Constant {{pressure}} charts normally contain plotted {{values of}} temperature, humidity, wind, and the vertical height {{above sea level}} of the pressure surface. They {{have a variety of}} uses. In the mountainous terrain of the western United States and Mexican Plateau, the 850 hPa pressure surface can be a more realistic depiction of the weather pattern than a standard surface analysis. Using the 850 and 700 hPa pressure surfaces, one can determine when and where warm advection (coincident with upward vertical motion) and cold advection (coincident with downward vertical motion) is occurring within the lower portions of the troposphere. Areas with small dewpoint depressions and are <b>below</b> <b>freezing</b> indicate the presence of icing conditions for aircraft. The 500 hPa pressure surface {{can be used as a}} rough guide for the motion of many tropical cyclones. Shallower tropical cyclones, which have experienced vertical wind shear, tend to be steered by winds at the 700 hPa level.|$|E
5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation point. When the dew point temperature falls <b>below</b> <b>freezing</b> {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The dew point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the dew point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew point determines the specific humidity of the air. The dew point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{greenhouse}} gases, however, water {{is not merely}} below its boiling point in all regions of the Earth, but <b>below</b> its <b>freezing</b> point at many altitudes. As a condensible greenhouse gas, it precipitates, with a much lower scale height and shorter atmospheric lifetime- weeks instead of decades. Without other greenhouse gases, Earth's blackbody temperature, <b>below</b> the <b>freezing</b> point of water, would cause water vapor {{to be removed from}} the atmosphere. [...] Water vapor is thus a [...] "slave" [...] to the non-condensible greenhouse gases.|$|R
50|$|Supercooling, {{also known}} as undercooling, {{is the process of}} {{lowering}} the temperature of a liquid or a gas <b>below</b> its <b>freezing</b> point without it becoming a solid.|$|R

Once more these indomitable souls left their warm cabin, took up their beds and nearly two thousand pounds of outfit and toiled down the river still farther into the terrible north. The chronicle of this trip by Burton is of mathematical brevity: [...] "On 20th concluded to move. Took four days. Very cold. Ther. down to 45 <b>below.</b> <b>Froze</b> one toe.
