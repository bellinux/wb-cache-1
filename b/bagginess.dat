5|$|To further aid {{athletes in}} gliding as aerodynamically as possible, they wear a {{one-piece}} fabric bodysuit {{more similar to}} a wingsuit than a ski suit. It is composed of five layers and is both loose-fitting and porous enough to allow up to 52litres of air to enter and 40litres to pass through. This generates yet more lift, but the amount of slack is stringently regulated by the FIS so as to not allow for excessive <b>bagginess</b> and thereby reducing its wingsuit-, sail- or parachute-like properties. In the early 2000s, bodysuits had reached exceptionally baggy proportions, resulting in humorous comparisons to flying squirrels. A ban on these baggy suits came into effect soon after, and today the level of slack for bodysuits is measured by FIS scrutineers before and after each jump: if the amount is exceeded, that athlete is disqualified due to an 'equipment violation'.|$|E

25|$|As an {{alternative}} to trousers, breeches (or knickers in variations of English where this does not refer to underwear) may be worn with informal suits, such as tweed. These are shorter, descending to just below the knees, fastened closely {{at the top of}} the calf by a tab or button cuff. While once common, they are now typically only worn when engaged in traditional outdoor sports, such as shooting or golf. The length and design is closely related to the plus-fours (and plus-sixes etc.) worn for sport, but differ in having no <b>bagginess.</b> They are usually designed to be worn with long socks meeting just below the knee, but riding breeches, worn with long boots such as top boots, are long enough to meet the boot and display no sock.|$|E
2500|$|Parachute {{pants are}} {{a style of}} {{trousers}} characterized {{by the use of}} ripstop nylon or extremely baggy cuts. In the original tight-fitting, extraneously zippered style of the late 1970s and early 1980s, [...] "parachute" [...] referred to the pants' synthetic nylon material. In the later 1980s, [...] "parachute" [...] may have referred to the extreme <b>bagginess</b> of the pant. These are also referred to as [...] "Hammer" [...] pants, due to rapper MC Hammer's signature style. Hammer pants differ from the parachute pants of the 1970s and early 1980s. They are typically worn as menswear and are often brightly colored. [...] Parachute pants became a fad in US culture in the 1980s as part of an increased cultural appropriation of breakdancing.|$|E
60|$|The {{inhabitants}} were plainly fluttered; {{the light}} moved to and fro, strengthening in one window, paling in another; {{and then the}} door was thrown open, and {{a man in a}} blouse appeared on the threshold carrying a lamp. He was a powerful young fellow, with bewildered hair and beard, wearing his neck open; his blouse was stained with oil-colours in a harlequinesque disorder; and there was something rural in the droop and <b>bagginess</b> of his belted trousers.|$|E
6000|$|... "You will wear," [...] I replied, [...] "evening dress, such as {{a gentleman}} wears. If it is full, your tailor should be {{responsible}} for its <b>bagginess.</b> And I will leave it to whatever erudition {{you are supposed to}} possess whether a white tie is rendered any whiter by being immaculate. And I will leave it to the consciences of you and your man whether a tie that is not white, and therefore not immaculate, could possibly form any part of a gentleman's evening dress. If not, then the perfect tie is included and understood in the term 'dress,' and its expressed addition predicates either a redundancy of speech or the spectacle of a man wearing two ties at once." ...|$|E
60|$|Tom Wheelock was by {{no means}} dressed as neatly as most of the Vancouver wharf-hands, and he looked like a man who had lost heart, and pride as well. He was gaunt and big-boned, with a seaman's weather-darkened face, but there was weariness and {{something}} that suggested vacancy in its expression. He and Jimmy had the same blue eyes, and they were kindly and honest in the case of each; but Tom Wheelock's were a trifle watery, and there was a certain <b>bagginess</b> under them, while his mouth was slack. In fact, the man, as his son recognized, appeared to have sunk into a state of limpness that was mental as well as physical.|$|E
60|$|A {{sheet of}} spray {{temporarily}} blinded {{him as he}} crawled out of the scuttle, {{and then there was}} little to be seen but a haze of it flying athwart a gray sea lined by frothy ridges and smears of low-driving cloud. The Tyee's slanted mastheads seemed to rake through the latter, and she was wet everywhere; but she was still hammering to windward with bows that swung up streaming over the long seas. On the one hand, a dingy smear, that might have been a point with pines on it, lifted itself out of the grayness, and Tom Wheelock pointed to it as he swayed with his wheel. His wet face was almost gray, and Jimmy could see the suggestive <b>bagginess</b> under his eyes.|$|E
60|$|The quiet commonplace {{terms in}} which he put his question, and the perfect {{composure}} and politeness of his manner, reminded me a little of Gentleman Jones. But the doctor was much the more respectable-looking man of the two; his baldness was more intellectual and benevolent; there was a delicacy and propriety in the pulpiness of his fat white chin, a bland <b>bagginess</b> in his unwhiskered cheeks, a reverent roughness about his eyebrows and a fullness in his lower eyelids, which raised him far higher, physiognomically speaking, in the social scale, than my old prison acquaintance. Put a shovel-hat on Gentleman Jones, and the effect would only have been eccentric; put the same covering {{on the head of}} Doctor Dulcifer, and the effect would have been strictly episcopal.|$|E
6000|$|He marched upon them: Verona, a dumpy brown-haired girl of twenty-two, {{just out}} of Bryn Mawr, given to solicitudes about duty and sex and God and the unconquerable <b>bagginess</b> of the gray sports-suit she was now wearing. Ted--Theodore Roosevelt Babbitt--a {{decorative}} boy of seventeen. Tinka--Katherine--still a baby at ten, with radiant red hair and a thin skin which hinted of too much candy and too many ice cream sodas. Babbitt did not show his vague irritation as he tramped in. He really disliked being a family tyrant, and his nagging was as meaningless as it was frequent. He shouted at Tinka, [...] "Well, kittiedoolie!" [...] It was the only pet name in his vocabulary, except the [...] "dear" [...] and [...] "hon." [...] with which he recognized his wife, and he flung it at Tinka every morning.|$|E
60|$|The sun {{was high}} in the heavens when Weston awakened, ravenous, with an almost {{intolerable}} stitch in his side. He rose with a stagger, and then sat down again, while his face went awry, and took out his pipe. He had still a very little tobacco left, and he fancied that it might deaden the pangs of hunger. Then he glanced at Grenfell, who lay fast asleep close by, with his blanket falling away from him. The man's face was half buried among the withered needles which were thick in his unkempt hair, and he lay huddled together, grotesque and unsightly in ragged disarray. Weston vacantly noticed the puffiness of his cheeks, and the <b>bagginess</b> beneath his eyes. The stamp of indulgence was very plain upon him, and the younger man, who had led a simple, strenuous life, was sensible of a certain repulsion from him.|$|E
60|$|Making up to {{this old}} man, Israel, after {{a word or two}} of salutation, offered to change clothes with him. As his own clothes were prince-like {{compared}} to the ditchers, Israel thought that however much his proposition might excite the suspicion of the ditcher, yet self-interest would prevent his communicating the suspicions. To be brief, the two went behind a hedge, and presently Israel emerged, presenting the most forlorn appearance conceivable; while the old ditcher hobbled off in an opposite direction, correspondingly improved in his aspect; though it was rather ludicrous than otherwise, owing to the immense <b>bagginess</b> of the sailor-trowsers flapping about his lean shanks, {{to say nothing of the}} spare voluminousness of the pea-jacket. But Israel--how deplorable, how dismal his plight! Little did he ween that these wretched rags he now wore, were but suitable to that long career of destitution before him: one brief career of adventurous wanderings; and then, forty torpid years of pauperism. The coat was all patches. And no two patches were alike, and no one patch was the color of the original cloth. The stringless breeches gaped wide open at the knee; the long woollen stockings looked as if they had been set up at some time for a target. Israel looked suddenly metamorphosed from youth to old age; just like an old man of eighty he looked. But, indeed, dull, dreary adversity was now in store for him; and adversity, come it at eighteen or eighty, is the true old age of man. The dress befitted the fate.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Britling did {{not look}} at all as Mr. Direck had {{expected}} him to look. He had expected an Englishman in a country costume of golfing tweeds, like the Englishman in country costume one sees in American illustrated stories. Drooping out of the country costume of golfing tweeds he had expected to see the mildly unhappy face, pensive even to its drooping moustache, with which Mr. Britling's publisher had for some faulty and unfortunate reason familiarised the American public. Instead of this, Mr. Britling was in a miscellaneous costume, and mildness was the last quality one could attribute to him. His moustache, his hair, his eyebrows bristled; his flaming freckled face seemed about to bristle too. His little hazel eyes came out with a [...] "ping" [...] and looked at Mr. Direck. Mr. Britling was one of a large but still remarkable class of people who seem at the mere approach of photography to change their hair, their clothes, their moral natures. No photographer had ever caught a hint of his essential Britlingness and bristlingness. Only the camera could ever induce Mr. Britling to brush his hair, and for the camera alone did he reserve that expression of submissive martyrdom Mr. Direck knew. And Mr. Direck was altogether unprepared for a certain casualness of costume that sometimes overtook Mr. Britling. He was wearing now a very old blue flannel blazer, no hat, and a pair of knickerbockers, not tweed breeches but tweed knickerbockers of a remarkable <b>bagginess,</b> and made of one of those virtuous socialistic homespun tweeds that drag out into woolly knots and strings wherever there is attrition. His stockings were worsted and wrinkled, and on his feet were those extraordinary slippers of bright-coloured bast-like interwoven material one buys in the north of France. These were purple with a touch of green. He had, in fact, thought of the necessity of meeting Mr. Direck at the station at the very last moment, and had come away from his study in the clothes that had happened to him when he got up. His face wore the amiable expression of a wire-haired terrier disposed to be friendly, and it struck Mr. Direck that for a man of his real intellectual distinction Mr. Britling was unusually short.|$|E
6000|$|I allude {{of course}} in {{particular}} here to the æsthetic clue in general, with which it was that we most (or that I at any rate most) fumbled, without our in the least having then, as I have already noted, any such rare name for it. There were sides on which it fairly dangled about us, involving our small steps and wits; though others too where I could, for my own part, but clutch {{at it in the}} void. Our experience of the theatre for instance, which had played such a part for us at home, almost wholly dropped in just the most propitious air: an anomaly indeed half {{explained by the fact that}} life in general, all round us, was perceptibly more theatrical. And there were other reasons, whether definitely set before us or not, which we grasped in proportion as we gathered, by depressing hearsay, that the French drama, great, strange and important, was as much out of relation to our time of life, our so little native strain and our cultivated innocence, as the American and English had been directly addressed to them. To the Cirque d'Été, the Cirque d'Hiver, the Théâtre du Cirque we were on occasion conducted--we had fallen so to the level of circuses, and that name appeared a safety; in addition to which the big theatre most bravely bearing it, the especial home at that time of the glittering and multitudinous féerie, did seem to lift the whole scenic possibility, for our eyes, into a higher sphere of light and grace than any previously disclosed. I recall Le Diable d'Argent as in particular a radiant revelation--kept before us a whole long evening and as an almost blinding glare; which was quite right for the donnée, the gradual shrinkage of the Shining One, the money-monster hugely inflated at first, to all the successive degrees of loose <b>bagginess</b> as he leads the reckless young man he has originally contracted with from dazzling pleasure to pleasure, till at last he is a mere shrivelled silver string such as you could almost draw through a keyhole. That was the striking moral, for the young man, however regaled, had been somehow [...] "sold"; which we hadn't in the least been, who had had all his pleasures and none of his penalty, whatever this was to be. I was to repine a little, in these connections, at a much later time, on reflecting that had we only been [...] "taken" [...] in the Paris of that period as we had been taken in New York we might have come in for celebrities--supremely fine, perhaps supremely rank, flowers of the histrionic temperament, springing as they did from the soil of the richest romanticism and adding to its richness--who practised that braver art and finer finish which a comparatively homogenous public, forming a compact critical body, still left possible. Rachel was alive, but dying; the memory of Mademoiselle Mars, at her latest, was still in the air; Mademoiselle Georges, a massive, a monstrous antique, had withal returned for a season to the stage; but we missed her, as we missed Déjazet and Frédéric Lemâitre and Mélingue and Samson; to say nothing of others of the age before the flood--taking for the flood that actual high tide of the outer barbarian presence, the general alien and polyglot, in stalls and boxes, which I remember to have heard Gustave Flaubert lament as the ruin of the theatre through the assumption of judgeship by a bench to whom the very values of the speech of author and actor were virtually closed, or at the best uncertain.|$|E

50|$|The style {{supposedly}} {{originated from}} a ban in 1924 on {{the wearing of}} knickers by Oxford (and Cambridge) undergraduates at lectures.

40|$|Background:Island flap {{techniques}} {{currently used}} in urethroplasty utilize the prepuce and the dorsal penile skin. Our {{experience with a}} one-stage island flap urethroplasty for urethral strictures utilizing the ventral penile skin is described. Patients and Method: This is a longitudinal study of seventy six consecutive patients with impassable and complicated urethral strictures treated using this technique over a seven-year period. Sixty were bulbous while sixteen were bulbomembranous urethral strictures. Following operation the patients were assessed using urine flow rates, urethrograms and some urethroscopy. Restrictures were successfully reoperated. Results: Sixty-eight patients (89. 5 %) had satisfactory voiding with good urine stream without complication at one year after operation. Five patients (6. 6 %) had restricture and three (3. 9 %) others had urethral <b>bagginess</b> and postmicturition dribbling. The overall complication rate was 10. 5 %. At three years after initial operation and reoperation seventy-five patients (98. 7 %) were voiding satisfactorily. There was one complete failure, no death. Conclusion: This technique has produced satisfactory results compared with other similar techniques in current use. Further work is required to make valid conclusions {{about the value of}} this procedure...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered in paper converting {{is caused by the}} occurrence of "baggy webs", which essentially is when the tension profile of the paper web is uneven. In an area with low tension the paper is longer, which results in <b>bagginess.</b> The baggy parts can not usually be stretched to even out the tension of the paper web in a converting machine, with the result that runnability problems are likely to occur. The aim of the work described in this thesis was to investigate three particular stages in papermaking, namely drying, calendering and storage, and rank them according to their propensity for inducing baggy webs. The focus was placed on investigating the effects of uneven moisture and grammage profiles on the machine-direction strain difference profile. The largest strain difference occurred when there were systematic thick streaks throughout a reel that formed ridges. Stress relaxation during storage then gave rise to a difference in strain of 0. 14 % when the ridge height was around 2 - 3 mm. Thickness variations due to variations in grammage is also a source of moisture variation. A difference in moisture of 5 % in the calendering stage resulted in strain differences of about 0. 05 - 0. 08 %. These strain differences resulted in creases being formed as early on as in the calender nip when differences in both grammage and moisture content were present. Most creases appeared when the moisture difference was 2 - 8 %. The difference in grammage could be large without creases being formed when no differences in moisture content were present. A moisture difference of about 5 - 6 % during drying resulted in a strain difference of 0. 1 % measured on isotropic samples. The moist area turned into a tight streak when the moisture difference appeared at moisture contents higher than 25 %. At moisture contents lower than 20 %, on the contrary, the moist area turned into a slack streak. The conclusion drawn is that papermakers should concentrate first and foremost on eliminating variations in grammage, especially if these are systematic. This would also eliminate some variations in moisture content, which would solve more problems...|$|E
