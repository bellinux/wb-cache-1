25|$|From {{one of his}} {{experiments}} emerged the Cyber Series – artificial humanoids possessing superhuman {{strength and}} agility. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> amiss: The 5000 original Cybers, engineered {{to be the perfect}} servants, mimicked human emotions too closely, displaying free will of their own. When they disobey orders from Reichter, he orders all of the Cyber Series to be destroyed. After Cyber-29 died falling from a cliff, Reichter transfers his brain into the body of a panther and names him Data-7. Cyber-6 was the only true Cyber to survive the massacre, escaping {{with the help of a}} black slave who hid her away in a fishing village. When Reichter interrogates to kill the slave, Cybersix arrives at the city of Meridiana, where she battles Reichter and his minions, and disguises herself as fellow teacher Adrian Seidelman after the real one is killed in a car wreck.|$|E
500|$|Speculation about {{a return}} to MMA lasted until March 24, 2015, when Lesnar {{announced}} {{in an interview on}} SportsCenter that he had re-signed with WWE and officially closed the door on {{a return to}} MMA, even though he was offered a deal [...] "ten times more" [...] than what he had made previously in his MMA career. He further elaborated that, while he was training for months for a return to the UFC, he felt [...] "physically great <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> lacking mentally". Lesnar added that [...] " [...] an older caveman now, so [...] makes smarter caveman decisions" [...] and that he chose to sign with WWE instead of returning to MMA because he could [...] "work part-time with full-time pay".|$|E
2500|$|Sixty-three years later, in 1998, Johnson recreated his father’s {{journey with}} his two sons. Johnson {{undertook}} the journey, documented in a 2001 film called Carnauba: A Son’s Memoir, in a replica Sikorsky S-38 amphibious plane like the one his father used. During {{the course of the}} film, Johnson reflects on his somewhat difficult relationship with his often-absent father as well as his own battle with alcoholism. Said Johnson of the journey, [...] "I started to get this idea that some people thought was crazy, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> telling me to do it… to recreate my father’s airplane and retrace his journey. [...] Gene said I was doing it {{to spend more time with}} my father after all these years... in the end that turned out to be true." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of their huge support in 1963, the West Indies were invited to tour England again only three years later. Despite the England press and public fearing the impact of Hall and his partner Griffith, it was soon clear that their powers had waned {{somewhat}} since 1963. Hall's [...] "action was as poetic as ever and his commitment was just as great, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> missing." [...] He captured 18 wickets in the five Tests at an average of 30.83. However, Hall was still considered [...] "the key man of the [...] attack" [...] and on occasion was still as damaging as ever. His finest moment of the series was in the fourth Test at Headingley where a [...] "spell of eighty minutes by Hall at his fastest and best destroyed England" [...] aiding his team to win the match by an innings and 55 runs and wrap up the series and the Wisden Trophy.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2016, it was {{announced}} that HIM would be headlining the Tuska Open Air Metal Festival in 2017, the band's first outdoor concert in Helsinki. In January 2017, HIM were also announced as the headliner of Miljoona Rock, held in Tuuri, Finland, on 18 July 2017. On 5 March 2017, HIM announced the band would be disbanding following a farewell tour that same year. In the announcement, Valo stated: [...] "After quarter of a century [...] of love and metal intertwined we sincerely feel HIM has run its unnatural course and adieus must be said in order to make way for sights, scents and sounds yet unexplored. We completed the pattern, solved the puzzle and turned the key. Thank you." [...] Valo further elaborated on the band's decision to call it quits later, stating: [...] "We got together and started playing some songs and thinking whats next [...] We felt like the new material wasn't taking flight. We got along well together, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> lacking. The stars weren't in alignment." [...] He also went on to say that: [...] "We felt like {{there was nothing left to}} give collectively. It was fun playing the old songs, everybody got along well together, but that spark was missing." [...] Valo didn't rule-out the possibility of the band reuniting in the future, stating: [...] "The good thing about this is that there's no drama [...] So it doesn't hurt the chances." ...|$|E

50|$|A new TP <b>is</b> {{breaking}} out, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> horribly wrong.

60|$|I {{stooped to}} kiss the red lips, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> in my way. It {{turned out to be}} a cold cigar. Miss Sellars thoughtfully removed it, and threw it away. Our lips met. Her large arms closed about my neck and held me tight.|$|E
60|$|They {{clustered}} at {{the door}} of the tent, peeping over each other's shoulders, and none wishing to be the first to close with that laughing, mocking giant. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> pushed forward upon a spear point, and as he saw it, Maximin groaned and his sword sank to the earth.|$|E
60|$|She stopped {{underneath}} the tree where the maiden dwelt and, gathering some dry sticks, kindled a fire.

6000|$|... “Why, Weldon, {{this is an}} {{unexpected}} pleasure,” he exclaimed in a pleasant voice that belied his rude costume, for its tones were well modulated and cultured. “I’ve been trying to call you up for three days, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> wrong with the line.

50|$|From {{all over}} Europe, even {{from behind the}} Iron Curtain, Gypsies make an annual pilgrimage to the holy shrine of their patron saint in the Provence region of {{southern}} France. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> different about this year's gathering, with many suspicious deaths. Cecile Dubois and Neil Bowman, a British agent, decide to investigate.|$|R
60|$|Many {{would have}} {{pronounced}} it a clever thing; the nose was strictly Greek, the chin curved upward gracefully, the mouth was sweetly haughty, the brow classically smooth and low, and the breezy hair well done. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wanting; Psyche felt that, {{and could have}} taken her Venus by the dimpled shoulders, and given her a hearty shake, if that would have put strength and spirit into the lifeless face.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{all this}} was no [...] "malice prepense" [...] in me, for I solemnly believe that I was the best-natured boy in the world; <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> the matter with the {{attraction}} of cohesion, or the attraction of gravitation--with the general dispensation of matter around me--that, let me do what I would, things would fall down, and break, or be torn and damaged, if I only came near them; and my unluckiness in any matter seemed in exact proportion to my carefulness.|$|E
60|$|After {{school was}} out in the afternoon, he met more of the boys, but none of them knew just what to do with him. The place that he had once had in their lives was filled; he was an outsider, who might be {{suffered}} among them, but he was no longer of them. He did not understand this at once, nor well know what hurt him. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> gone that could not be called back, something lost that could not be found.|$|E

6000|$|Philip {{waiting in}} the bright, rich room saw her coming. He stood {{unconscious}} of his lately changed appearance, his evening clothes. A London tailor had assured {{him that he was}} now properly dressed for the way of the world, and at last his [...] "priest's garb" [...] was forgotten. His worshipful face, slightly thin, expressed only joy as he ran forward. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong with Isabel. Something seemed to be lost from the lover imploring at her side; and she shrank, holding him aloof for judgment.|$|E
60|$|For all that, {{he went on}} {{and found}} a strange delight in {{watching}} Barbara. Her clothes harmonized with the soft colors of lichen and stone; her movements were confident and light. He got no sense of effort; her pose was seldom strained and the lines of her limbs and body flowed in easy curves. He thought she rather flitted than labored up the rock. Practice no doubt accounted for much, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> due to temperament. Barbara did not hesitate; she trusted her luck and went ahead.|$|E
60|$|Shaphambury {{seemed an}} odd place to me even then. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> {{quickening}} in {{me at that}} time to feel the oddness of many accepted things. Now in the retrospect I see it as intensely queer. The whole place was strange to my untraveled eyes; the sea even was strange. Only twice in my life had I been at the seaside before, and then I had gone by excursion to places on the Welsh coast whose great cliffs of rock and mountain backgrounds made the effect of the horizon very different from what it is upon the East Anglian seaboard. Here what they call a cliff was a crumbling bank of whitey-brown earth not fifty feet high.|$|E
30|$|The {{researches}} {{show the}} truth that the administrative contradictions may be transformed to operating contradictions to <b>be</b> solved. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> in a fuzzy state, such as {{whose job it is}} to find administrative contradictions and make the transformation in a company and whether or not an engineer in our classes should pay more attention to them.|$|R

50|$|Voyager {{tries to}} get through the swarm's space <b>but</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> slowing them down. Phaser fire {{directed}} at the enemy is rebounded right back at them.

60|$|So, shaken, afraid, {{they went}} back to her parents in the kitchen, and dissimulated. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> roused in both of them that they could not now allay. It {{intensified}} and heightened their senses, they were more vivid, and powerful in their being. But under it all was a poignant sense of transience. It was a magnificent self-assertion {{on the part of both}} of them, he asserted himself before her, he felt himself infinitely male and infinitely irresistible, she asserted herself before him, she knew herself infinitely desirable, and hence infinitely strong. And after all, what could either of them get from such a passion but a sense of his or of her own maximum self, in contradistinction to all the rest of life? Wherein was something finite and sad, for the human soul at its maximum wants a sense of the infinite.|$|E
60|$|It {{amounted}} to sixty cents. She {{had made no}} bargain, {{but she was a}} little astonished. However, she said nothing, but left the place without asking for any more work. In fact she forgot all about it. She had an idea that everything was all wrong, and that idea engrossed her mind entirely. There was no mistake about the sum paid, for the lady clerk had referred to the printed table of prices when she calculated the amount due. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> wrong, and, at the moment, Euphemia could not tell what it was. She left the place, and started to walk back to the ferry. But she was so tired and weak, and hungry--it was now an hour or two past her regular luncheon time--that she thought she should faint if she did not go somewhere and get some refreshments.|$|E

It was not difficult to guess your feelings toward me, even before certain things occurred of which I will not speak. I did my best, from the very first, to make Bob give up the thought of marrying me, although I loved and honored him. Loving him as I do, I {{do not want to be}} the cause of separating him from his father, and of depriving him of that which is rightfully his. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> due to myself. If I should ever make up my mind to marry him," [...] continued Cynthia, looking at Mr. Worthington steadfastly, [...] "it will not be because your consent is given or withheld." ...|$|E
