The battle was costly for <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>and</b> many casualties were suffered from extensive use of poison gas, including the new German Yellow Cross shell containing the blistering agent sulfur mustard (mustard gas).|$|E
5|$|Although {{casualties}} appeared even {{in numbers}} for both sides, the Austrians fielded a significantly larger fighting force of nearly 55,000at Ostrach, with another 60,000stretched along {{a line between}} Lake Constance and Ulm. French casualties amounted to more than 12percent of their force, and Austrian, approximately four percent. The French were forced back to Stockach, where on 25March the armies engaged again, this time with greater losses on <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>and</b> a decisive Austrian victory.|$|E
5|$|Although {{casualties}} appeared even on both sides, the Austrians had {{a significantly}} larger fighting force, both on the field at Ostrach, and stretched along a line between Lake Constance and Ulm.

5|$|The {{first wave}} of the Muslim conquests ended with the siege of Constantinople in 718, and {{the border between the}} two empires became {{stabilized}} along the mountains of eastern Anatolia. Raids and counter-raids continued on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>and</b> became almost ritualized, but the prospect of outright conquest of Byzantium by the Caliphate receded. This led to far more regular, and often friendly, diplomatic contacts, as well as a reciprocal recognition of the two empires.|$|E

One British ship was {{faster than the}} others, the 38-gun HMS Artois under Captain Edmund Nagle cutting Révolutionnaire off from the shore and bringing the larger French ship to action. For 45 minutes Artois battled Révolutionnaire until support arrived, {{at which point the}} French frigate's crew surrendered their ship in defiance of their captain's orders. Casualties and damage were light on <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>and</b> Révolutionnaire was rapidly commissioned into the Royal Navy, joining the squadron that had captured her and subsequently capturing the French frigate Unité at the Action of 13 April 1796.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Arras (also {{known as}} the Second Battle of Arras) was a British {{offensive}} on the Western Front during World War I. From 9 April to 16 May 1917, British troops attacked German defences near the French city of Arras on the Western Front. The British achieved the longest advance since trench warfare had begun, surpassing the record set by the French Sixth Army on 1 July 1916. The British advance slowed {{in the next few}} days and the German defence recovered. The battle became a costly stalemate for <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>and</b> by the end of the battle the British Third and First armies had suffered about 160,000 casualties and the German 6th Army 125,000 casualties.|$|E

Many ships on both sides were badly damaged, and around 2,000 men killed or wounded. Towards the end, a squadron of Danish ships met up with Dutch and escorted them into the harbor of Copenhagen. The Swedish fleet had failed; much-needed reinforcements and supplies had reached the beleaguered Danish town. The combined Danish and Dutch fleet now had control of the seas, forcing the Swedish fleet to seek refuge in the harbor of Landskrona on the Swedish mainland.|$|E

Struggles and disturbances continued till the 14th century, by which the Mandé merchants were trading with the Hausa, between Lake Chad and the Niger.

5|$|After {{the arrival}} of the strikebreakers on the {{afternoon}} of November 2, Indianapolis Police Chief Martin Hyland had mounted city police escort them from Indianapolis Union Station to the company's maintenance and storage carhouses, one block south of the terminal building. The police broke a path through the strikers to allow the strikebreakers into the building so they could prepare to launch the cars. Organized labor leaders held two mass meetings and unions across the city agreed to send additional men to support the strikers against the strikebreakers. A riot began as the strikebreakers attempted to restore transit service. Whenever the strikebreakers launched a streetcar from the storage barns, the strikers attacked them with rocks and brick. They boarded the streetcars, dragged the crews from the cars and lit the cars on fire. Many injuries occurred on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>and</b> ambulances were called to carry the injured to a hospital. After the destruction of six cars, the strikebreakers abandoned their attempts to restart service.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{campaign}} was decided by a final major action, May 1794 saw both fleets at sea with several subordinate squadrons, both admirals conducting a complicated series of convoy, commerce raiding and fleet manoeuvre operations. Numerous merchant ships and small warships were taken or destroyed during the month-long campaign by <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>and</b> there were also two partial fleet engagements as Howe and Villaret made first contact. Both admirals suffered from wilful disobedience {{by a number of}} their officers during the battle, as well as confusion in reading signals which caused an uneven series of melees to break out rather than the unified battleline Howe had envisaged when planning the action. Nevertheless, both commanders were highly praised on their return to their home ports and the battle was considered a success by both sides, with only a few dissenters amongst the naval establishments of both nations.|$|E
5|$|Casualties {{were heavy}} on <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>and</b> both vessels were in such poor {{condition}} that each commander {{thought he had}} sunk his opponent. Most of La Vengeance rigging had been blown away; only the lower foremast, lower mizzenmast, and bowsprit were operational. Pitot set course for Curaçao {{and was forced to}} ground his vessel there to prevent her from sinking. The number of French casualties is somewhat unclear: official French accounts report 28 dead and 40 wounded, while accounts from Curaçao state that the French frigate had lost 160 men. Once Pitot reached Curaçao he was beset with further problems. La Vengeance remained out of action for months due to difficulties in acquiring support needed to repair the frigate from the Dutch officials there. A French expedition to seize the island brought the materiel needed to repair the frigate, but when asked to help attack the island Pitot refused and slipped away to Guadaloupe.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{had hoped}} {{to pursue a career}} in the British Army, but his mother vetoed an active {{military}} career. He had been gazetted colonel on 9 November 1858—to his disappointment, as he had wanted to earn his commission by examination. In September 1861, Edward was sent to Germany, supposedly to watch military manoeuvres, but actually in order to engineer a meeting between him and Princess Alexandra of Denmark, the eldest daughter of Prince Christian of Denmark and his wife Louise. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert had already decided that Edward and Alexandra should marry. They met at Speyer on 24 September under the auspices of his elder sister, Victoria, who had married the Crown Prince of Prussia in 1858. Edward's elder sister, acting upon instructions from their mother, had met Princess Alexandra at Strelitz in June; the young Danish princess made a very favourable impression. Edward and Alexandra were friendly from the start; the meeting went well for <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>and</b> marriage plans advanced.|$|E

His nephew Nguyen Phuc Anh was the most senior member of the Nguyễn family to have survived the Tây Sơn victory and conquest of Saigon in 1777. Nguyễn Ánh fled to Hà Tiên in the far south of the country, where he met Pigneau de Behaine, a French priest who became his adviser and played a large part in his rise to power. Over the next few decades, there were continuous attacks and counterattacks by <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>and</b> Saigon changed hands frequently. Eventually, Nguyễn Ánh was forced him into exile. The Tây Sơn regularly raided the rice growing areas of the south during the harvesting season, confiscating the Nguyễns' supply of food.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the battle, the fighting around Isurava has come to form {{a key part of}} the Australian narrative of the campaign. The Japanese were victorious in capturing Isurava, but Australian accounts in the early years after the war characterised the battle as a successful delaying action by a heavily outnumbered force that inflicted more casualties than it sustained, highlighting the bravery of Australian troops in an epic and desperate action of national survival. In this regard, the Battle of Isurava has come to form {{a key part of the}} Anzac legend, although recent accounts have re-examined the battle. As the size of the Japanese force committed to the fighting has been re-evaluated, the magnitude of the Australian defensive feat has also been reinterpreted. Recent analysis, while acknowledging the individual bravery of both Australian and Japanese soldiers, highlights tactical deficiencies on <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> <b>and</b> now characterises the battle as one in which Australian forces were able to withdraw largely due to tactical errors from the Japanese commanders.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} United Kingdom and the Irish Free State had been {{strained}} since the appointment in 1932 of Éamon de Valera as Taoiseach (Prime Minister).
