40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} <b>broxaterol</b> enhanced recovery of fatigued canine diaphragm. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare the inotropic effects of salbutamol and <b>broxaterol</b> on fatigued canine diaphragm. Low-frequency fatigue was induced in 14 mongrel dogs by electrophrenic stimulation, which was continued until transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) at 20 Hz was reduced by 50 % or for 1 h. After stabilization of fatigue, the animals received a bolus (18. 5 microg/kg) of either <b>broxaterol</b> or salbutamol, followed by a continuous infusion (0. 43 microg/kg/min). A second bolus of 74. 0 microg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion of 1. 72 microg/kg/min, was given after 90 min. Both drugs significantly increased twitch Pdi. Twitch Pdi measured 90 min after the first and second doses of <b>broxaterol</b> increased by 28 +/- 23 % and 42 +/- 34 %, respectively, whereas the salbutamol-induced increase was clearly smaller (9 +/- 10 % and 17 +/- 15 %, respectively). <b>Broxaterol</b> increased Pdi at 20 Hz by 25 +/- 28 % with the first dose and by 29 +/- 21 % with the second dose. In contrast, salbutamol did not alter Pdi at 20 Hz. Neither drug affected Pdi at 100 Hz. We conclude that <b>broxaterol</b> promoted recovery of low-frequency fatigue of the canine diaphragm in vivo in a dose-dependent manner, whereas salbutamol only minimally improved force production by the fatigued diaphragm. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that regular treatment with high doses of beta 2 -agonists might result in poorer control of asthma and increased bronchial responsiveness. We have examined change in FEV 1 (delta FEV 1), bronchial reactivity, peak expiratory flow (PEF), and symptoms during and after 3 wk of regular treatment with a relatively low dose of albuterol and <b>broxaterol,</b> a new beta 2 -agonist. Eleven subjects 18 to 50 yr of age with mild asthma inhaled albuterol (200 micrograms), <b>broxaterol</b> (400 micrograms), or placebo three times a day for 3 wk with a 2 - to 4 -wk run-in/washout period between treatments. Ipratropium bromide was allowed for symptomatic relief. The PD 20 (dose of histamine causing a 20 % fall in FEV 1) was measured before and 11, 35, and 59 h after cessation of treatment and a bronchodilator dose-response study before and 83 h after cessation of treatment. Change from baseline after albuterol and <b>broxaterol</b> are compared with change after placebo. Diurnal change in PEF (amplitude % mean) increased during treatment with albuterol by 6. 5 % (95 % CI, 1. 7 - 12. 3; p < 0. 02) mainly because of a fall in morning PEF. Cessation of treatment with both beta 2 -agonists was associated with a fall in FEV 1 and PD 20 compared with placebo. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Increased {{bronchial}} hyperresponsiveness (BHR) {{has been}} reported in adult asthmatic patients after regular treatment with beta 2 -agonists. In this study we evaluated the effect of a 4 -weeks treatment period with <b>broxaterol,</b> a new beta 2 -agonist, on BHR in asthmatic children living in two different environmental conditions. Two groups of patients', 24 domiciled at sea level, allergen exposed (group 1), and 24 resident at high altitude (Misurina, 1, 756 m) in an allergen-free environment (group 2), have been tested. Children were randomly treated with <b>broxaterol</b> 400 mug q. i. d. or sodium chromoglycate 10 mg q. i. d. (as control treatment) by the metered dose inhaler for 4 weeks. Pulmonary function tests and methacholine challenge were performed at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the study. Throughout the study period a diary card was completed and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was measured three times daily. Forty-two of the patients admitted concluded the study. No significant change was observed in the methacholine PC 20 throughout the study period regardless of the type of treatment and/or environment. The amplitude percentage mean of diurnal changes in PEFR during the study period showed no statistically significant differences between treatments or centres, or in the interaction of treatment with centre, time with treatment, time with centre, time with centre and treatment (p > 0. 05). Therefore in this pilot study regular treatment with <b>broxaterol</b> for 4 weeks did not cause an increase in BHR in asthmatic children both in conditions of allergen exposure and in an environment free of offending allergens...|$|E
40|$|Since <b>broxaterol,</b> a new beta 2 -agonist, {{has been}} shown to improve {{contractility}} of fatigued canine diaphragm in vitro, a controlled, randomized study was designed to assess its effects on fatigued canine diaphragm in vivo, and compare these to the expected inotropic effects of aminophylline. Diaphragm fatigue was induced in 21 dogs using electrophrenic stimulation at 20 Hz until transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) at 20 Hz was reduced to about 50 % of its original value. After stabilization of fatigue, animals were randomized in three groups. Aminophylline-treated animals received an intravenous bolus of 20 mg/kg, broxaterol-treated animals were given an initial bolus of 100 micrograms/kg, and control animals obtained an equal load of saline. After 3 h, aminophylline-treated animals and broxaterol-treated animals received a second dose of 20 mg/kg and 200 micrograms/kg, respectively, whereas control animals received a second dose of saline. Pdi was measured every 30 min for 6 h. At therapeutic serum levels, theophylline did not affect Pdi at any stimulation frequency compared with control conditions. In contrast, <b>broxaterol</b> administration resulted in a significant (p less than 0. 05) and long-lasting increase in Pdi at low stimulation frequencies. Pdi at 20 Hz thus increased by 20 +/- 16 % 90 min after the first bolus, and by 36 +/- 18 % 90 min after the second dose. We conclude that (1) <b>broxaterol</b> promotes recovery of low-frequency fatigue in a dose-dependent way, and (2) theophylline does not improve the force output of fatigued canine diaphragm in vivo. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} antiasthma drugs on asthmatic reactions and airway inflammation, we studied several groups of sensitized subjects treated with active drugs or placebo before and after exposure to toluene diisocyanate in the laboratory. We observed that the steroidal anti-inflammatory agent prednisone, but not the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent indomethacin, inhibits the late (but not the early) asthmatic reactions induced by TDI. Prednisone also inhibits the increase of bronchial responsiveness and the increase of neutrophils, eosinophils, and albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid that are associated with late asthmatic reactions induced by exposure to TDI. Beclomethasone has a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on TDI-induced late asthmatic reactions, whereas theophylline has a partial inhibitory effect on both early and late asthmatic reactions, and verapamil, ketotifen, cromolyn. Beta 2 -adrenergic agonists have variable effects: salbutamol has no effect on early and late asthmatic reactions by itself, but it potentiates the inhibitory effect of low doses of beclomethasone. <b>Broxaterol</b> inhibits early asthmatic reactions, but has no effect on the late asthmatic reactions and the associated inflammatory response. These results suggest that, in sensitized subjects, late asthmatic reactions induced by toluene diisocyanate can be prevented by steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, whereas early asthmatic reactions may be prevented either by an association of inhaled steroids and beta-adrenergic agonists, or by beta-adrenergic agonists (e. g., <b>broxaterol)</b> with more complex mechanisms of action...|$|E
40|$|Abstract 0 Organogels {{obtained}} by adding {{small amounts of}} water to a solution of lecithin in organic solvents were studied as matrices for the transdermal transport of drugs. Gels obtained from isopropyl palmitate and cyclooctane were used (molar ratios of water to lecithin of 3 and 12, respectively). Preliminarily histological studies showed that the gels have no harmful effect when applied to the skin for prolonged periods. Data relative to the stability of the organogels with time are also presented. Scopolamine and <b>broxaterol</b> were used as model drugs, and the transdermal experiments were done with a Franz diffusion cell and human skin obtained from plastic surgery. The transport rate of scopo-lamine obtained with the lecithin gels was about one order of magnitude higher than that obtained with an aqueous solution of the drug at the same concentration. In contrast, the transport rates of scopolamine obtained with the microemulsion solution prior to gelation (molar ratio of water to lecithin, 0) were not different from those obtained with the gel...|$|E
