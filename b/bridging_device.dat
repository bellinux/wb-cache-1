40|$|Abstract: Bluetooth {{scatternet}} {{is a set}} of piconets interconnected via <b>bridge</b> <b>devices.</b> A good inter-piconet scheduling {{is necessary}} for the <b>bridge</b> <b>devices</b> to switch among the piconets they participated. This paper proposes an inter-piconet scheduling algorithm, Traffic-Aware Scatternet Scheduling (TASS), for bridges in bluetooth scatternets. According to the traffic information of all masters that the bridge is connected, TASS can adaptively switch the bridge to the masters with high traffic loads and increase the usage of the bridge. In addition, TASS can reduce the number of failed unsniffs and the overhead of the bridge switch wastes to further increase the overall system performance. Simulation results show that TASS outperforms the existing inter-piconet scheduling in network throughput and adaptability for various traffic loads. 1...|$|R

40|$|October, 2005, Revised June, 2007 Composed of {{a variety}} of {{scientific}} and technical experts plus a few lay members, thousands of Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) in the US must identify and assess the potential risks to human research subjects, and balance those risks against the potential benefits of the research. These assessments are laden with uncertainty, however. Most IRBs handle risk and its uncertainty by adopting a version of the precautionary principle, which is largely suggested by the Belmont Report and the Common Rule. To assess scientific merit, IRBs tacitly employ a "sanguinity principle," which treats uncertainty as inevitable in scientific progress. In balancing the uncertainties of human subjects risks and scientific benefits, IRBs use uncertainty as a <b>bridging</b> <b>device</b> that allows the approaches of science and ethics to be reconciled.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} locking compression plates (LCPs) in diaphyseal forearm fractures. METHODS. 9 women and 23 men (mean age, 35; range, 12 - 70 years) with 45 forearm fractures were treated by open reduction and internal fixation with 3. 5 -mm stainless steel LCPs. All patients were followed up monthly until union; the mean duration being 20 months. Radiographic assessment was performed at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. Clinical assessments regarding pain and function were undertaken at the final follow-up. RESULTS. Two patients had delayed union but none had nonunion. There was no deep infection and only one superficial infection. Two refractures occurred after implant removal, both were of simple transverse type and at the sites of the original fractures. 33 % of the fractures were reduced anatomically. 56 % of the fractures healed with no or minimal callus formation and 44 % with moderate callus formation. In total, 13 % of the anatomically reduced fractures had moderate or abundant callus formation. 22 patients opted for removal of the implants (29 LCPs), after a mean of 16 (range, 9 - 21) months. CONCLUSION. The LCP is an effective <b>bridging</b> <b>device</b> used for treating comminuted fractures, but for treating simple fractures its superiority over conventional plating {{is yet to be}} proven. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Although {{titanium}} alloys remain the preferred biomaterials for {{the manufacture of}} biomedical implants today, such devices can fail within 15 [*]years of implantation due to inadequate osseointegration. Furthermore, wear debris toxicity due to alloy metal ion release {{has been found to}} cause side-effects including neurotoxicity and chronic inflammation. Titanium, with its known biocompatibility, corrosion resistance, and high elastic modulus, could if harnessed {{in the form of a}} superficial scaffold or <b>bridging</b> <b>device,</b> resolve such issues. A novel three-dimensional culture approach was used to investigate the potential osteoinductive and osseointegrative capabilities of a laser-generated microporous, microrough medical grade IV titanium template on human skeletal stem cells (SSCs). Human SSCs seeded on a rough 90 -µm pore surface of ethylene oxide-sterilized templates were observed to be strongly adherent, and to display early osteogenic differentiation, despite their inverted culture in basal conditions over 21 [*]days. Limited cellular migration across the template surface highlighted the importance of high surface wettability in maximizing cell adhesion, spreading and cell-biomaterial interaction, while restricted cell ingrowth within the conical-shaped pores underlined the crucial role of pore geometry and size in determining the extent of osseointegration of an implant device. The overall findings indicate that titanium only devices, with appropriate optimizations to porosity and surface wettability, could yet play a major role in improving the long-term efficacy, durability, and safety of future implant technology...|$|E
40|$|In some {{patients}} with acute respiratory failure, the native lungs do not recover during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or complications occur that preclude the meaningful continuation of ECMO therapy. In such cases, emergency lung transplantation (LTx) represents the only therapeutic alternative. Between May 1988 and April 1993, {{the authors have}} performed LTx after ECMO support in five of 111 lung or heart-lung transplantations (4. 5 %). Two patients presented with early graft failure after unilateral LTx. In these patients, ECMO {{was used as a}} <b>bridging</b> <b>device</b> to unilateral re-LTx for 1, resp. 11 days. One patient died 6 months post-operatively from chronic rejection; the other underwent a third LTx and is doing well after 42 months. In three further patients already treated with ECMO for 5 to 12 days for ARDS (n = 2) or acute respiratory failure after liver and kidney transplantation, the native lungs did not recover (n = 2) or pulmonary hemorrhage developed. The last patient (unilateral LTx) and one of the former (bilateral LTx for ARDS) are long-term survivors (12, 30 months). The remaining patient (unilateral LTx for ARDS) had severe multiorgan failure {{at the time of his}} operation and died intraoperatively. The authors conclude that ECMO no longer represents a contraindication to subsequent LTx. Their results also support the continued investigation of this combined therapeutic approach...|$|E
30|$|Gardener et al. [18] {{compared}} the mechanical behavior under cyclic loading of LCP constructs and LCDCP constructs. Traditional compression plating failed significantly earlier in torsion. In AP bending, traditional constructs demonstrated significantly greater energy absorption, suggesting greater deformation. Fracture motion and stiffness measurements were discordant in the LCDCP specimens in torsion. In contrast, the LCP specimen had no discordance in stiffness and fracture motion. On the other hand, {{many of the}} other parameters compared between the two plates showed no difference, and the overall clinical advantage of locked plates is subtle. Xiong et al. [6] also showed in their cadaveric study that the LCP has a lower interface contact area and lower average force than that of the LCDCP and that the LCP is a good alternative for treating forearm and humerus diaphyseal fractures. In their study, Hoerdemann et al. [5] {{compared the}} in vitro biomechanical characteristics of LCDCP and LCP constructs in an osteotomy gap model of femoral fracture in neonatal calves and showed that insertion torque sufficient to provide adequate stability in femurs of newborn calves could not be achieved reliably with 4.5 -mm cortical screws, and that LCP constructs were significantly more resistant to compression than LCDCP constructs. Leung and Chow [19] compared LCDCP with PC-Fix and LCP in treatment of closed forearm fractures in their randomized control trial and said that the LCP is effective for use as a <b>bridging</b> <b>device</b> in treating comminuted fractures; its usage in simple fractures and its superiority over conventional plating systems is yet to be proved.|$|E
