The disadvantage is the cycle time is generally longer than solid tools. Note that solid multiple-form thread cutting tools look similar to taps, but they differ in that the cutting tool does not have a backtaper and there is not a lead-in chamfer.

2500|$|A common {{method of}} {{threading}} is cutting with taps and dies. Unlike drill bits, hand taps do not automatically remove the chips they create. [...] A hand tap cannot cut its threads {{in a single}} rotation because it creates long chips which quickly jam the tap (an effect known as [...] "crowding"), possibly breaking it. [...] Therefore, in manual thread cutting, normal wrench usage is to cut the threads 1/2 to 2/3 of a turn (180 to 240 degree rotation), then reverse the tap for about 1/6 of a turn (60 degrees) until the chips are broken by the back edges of the cutters. [...] It {{may be necessary to}} periodically remove the tap from the hole to clear the chips, especially when a <b>blind</b> <b>hole</b> is threaded.|$|E

2500|$|The trigger engages one {{arm of a}} [...] "z"-shaped sear {{pivoting}} in its centre {{between two}} upstanding brackets riveted or brazed {{to the inside of}} the lockplate. The other arm of the sear passes through a hole in the lockplate, and engages in a <b>blind</b> <b>hole</b> on the inner side of the wheel, thus effectively locking it and preventing any rotation but only because of a secondary sear or wedge that is pressed under the rear arm of the sear—that is between the lockplate and the sear—when the forward part of it engages into the recess in the wheel. When the trigger is pulled, the secondary lever is withdrawn from its position and the strong pull of the mainspring pushes the unsupported [...] main sear back into the lock and the wheel is free to rotate. The mechanism may seem overconstructed, but it prevents the trigger mechanism from working against the very powerful mainspring as it is the case with all vertical acting sears in flint and percussion locks or even modern firearms that still have cocks (revolvers).|$|E

50|$|A <b>blind</b> <b>hole</b> {{refers to}} a hole that is reamed, drilled, or milled to a {{specified}} depth without breaking through {{to the other side}} of the workpiece. The etymology is that it is not possible to see through a <b>blind</b> <b>hole.</b> Other types of holes also include through holes, and clearance holes. In this instance blind may also refer to any feature that is taken to a specific depth, more specifically referring to internally threaded hole (tapped holes). Not considering the drill point, the depth of the <b>blind</b> <b>hole,</b> conventionally, may be slightly deeper than that of the threaded depth.|$|E
25|$|Single-pass bore {{finishing}} is {{not well}} suited for <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> because the tool has a tapered lead on it which prevents {{the bottom of the}} hole from being finished.

40|$|<b>Blind</b> <b>holes</b> 5 mu m in {{diameter}} and 25 mu m deep were filled with copper electrodeposited from a copper sulfate electrolyte containing chloride ions, a suppressor, and an accelerator. A thin tantalum layer was deposited {{on top of a}} copper seed layer to locally inhibit the subsequent electrodeposition of copper. A clear difference appeared {{in the evolution of the}} cathode potential recorded during the galvanostatic deposition of copper on either copper metallized flat substrates or substrates containing copper metallized recessed <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> and selectively coated with Ta at the outside. The different steps during the filling of <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> by electrolytic copper were monitored and analyzed based on the evolution of the cathode potential during electrodeposition. An electrochemical depolarization of the electrode surface induced by an accelerating species occurred first. The subsequent evolution of the potential was dominated by a change in the electrode surface that occurs during the superfilling of <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> with copper. Finally, the time to achieve a complete filling of <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> with electrolytic copper was determined. A deeper insight on the superfilling mechanism with electrodeposited copper was obtained. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|With soft or average {{hardness}} materials, such as plastic, aluminum or mild steel, {{the common}} practice {{is to use}} an intermediate (plug) tap to cut the threads. If the threads are to extend {{to the bottom of}} a <b>blind</b> <b>hole,</b> the intermediate (plug) tap will be used to cut threads until the point of the tap reaches bottom, after which a bottoming tap will be used to finish the hole. Frequent ejection of the chips must be made in such an operation to avoid jamming and possibly breaking the tap. With hard materials, the machinist may start with a taper tap, whose less severe diameter transition reduces the amount of torque required to cut the threads. If threads are to be cut to the bottom of a <b>blind</b> <b>hole,</b> the taper tap will be followed by an intermediate (plug) tap and then a bottoming tap to finish the operation.|$|E

50|$|Core pins {{are used}} to produce holes in plastic parts. Through holes are easier to produce than <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> which don't go through the entire part. <b>Blind</b> <b>holes</b> are created by pins that are {{supported}} at only one end; hence such pins should not be long. Longer pins will deflect more and be pushed by {{the pressure of the}} molten plastic material during molding. It is recommended that hole depth-to-diameter ratio should not be more than 2.|$|R
50|$|A through hole, also {{thru-hole}} or clearance hole, {{refers to}} a hole that is reamed, drilled, milled etc., completely through the material of an object. In other words, a through hole is a hole that {{goes all the way}} through something. This is to distinguish it from a <b>blind</b> <b>hole,</b> which does not go {{all the way through the}} material of the object.|$|E
50|$|The first length {{standards}} {{to use this}} technique were rectangular section solid bars. A <b>blind</b> <b>hole</b> was bored at each end, to {{the depth of the}} neutral plane, and the calibration marks were made at this depth. This was inconvenient, as it was impossible to measure directly between the two marks, but only with an offset trammel down the wells.|$|E
5000|$|Single-point threading, {{where the}} {{workpiece}} is rotated, and a pointed cutting tool is {{fed into the}} workpiece {{at the same rate}} as the pitch of the internal thread. Single-pointing inside a <b>blind</b> <b>hole,</b> like boring inside one, is inherently more challenging than doing so in a through hole. This was especially true in the era when manual machining was the only method of control. Today, CNC makes these tasks less stressful, but nevertheless still more challenging than with through holes.|$|E
50|$|When {{two pieces}} of wood are {{to be joined by}} dowels {{embedded}} in <b>blind</b> <b>holes,</b> there are numerous methods for aligning the holes. For example, pieces of shot may be placed between the wood pieces to produce indentations when the pieces are clamped together; after the clamp is released, the indentations indicate the center points for drilling. Dowel centers are simple and inexpensive tools for aligning opposing <b>blind</b> <b>holes.</b> Various commercial systems, such as Dowelmax, have been devised to solve this problem.|$|R
50|$|When {{existing}} {{holes are}} to be enlarged or reshaped by EDM, through holes are preferred to <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> as they permit easier flow of dielectric fluid past the area being machined.|$|R
40|$|<b>Blind</b> <b>holes</b> 5 mu m diam and 25 mu m {{in depth}} {{were filled with}} {{electrodeposited}} copper. Before electrodeposition, the <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> were fully metallized with a copper seed layer or with a thin sputtered Ta layer deposited {{on top of the}} copper seed layer. Filling of partially Ta-capped features was three times faster than filling fully metallized features. For fully metallized features, the growth mode for copper electrodeposition is dominated by diffusion adsorption of a leveling agent. For partially Ta-capped surfaces, the growth mode was modified to differential acceleration through accumulation of an accelerating species at the bottom of features. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The {{first step}} in ion {{sculpting}} is to make either a through hole or a <b>blind</b> <b>hole,</b> most commonly using an focused ion beam (FIB). The holes are commonly ~100 nm, but can be made much smaller. This step {{may or may not}} be done at room temperature, with a low temperature of -120 C. Next, there are three common techniques to now 'sculpt' the hole: broad area ion exposure, TEM exposure, and FIB exposure. Holes can be closed completely, but also they can be left open at a lower limit of 1 - 10 nm.|$|E
50|$|This {{technique}} uses a broad area argon {{ion source}} beam. If {{the hole is}} blind (a <b>blind</b> <b>hole</b> is a hole that has not broken through on the backside yet) the wafer (often SiN or silicon/silicon oxide) is then turned upside down, and exposed with the argon beam. A detector counts the amount of ions passing through the membrane (which should be zero). The process stops when ions begin to be detected. This enables for a much smaller hole to be opened than if using an FIB alone. This method of nanopore fabrication relies on the ion beam to remove (sputter) some of the material from the backside of the sample, revealing part of the hole underneath.|$|E
5000|$|Bottoming tap or plug tap: [...] The tap {{illustrated}} {{in the top of}} the image has a continuous cutting edge with almost no taper — between 1 and 1.5 threads of taper is typical. [...] This feature enables a bottoming tap to cut threads to the bottom of a <b>blind</b> <b>hole.</b> A bottoming tap is usually used to cut threads in a hole that has already been partially threaded using one of the more tapered types of tap; the tapered end ("tap chamfer") of a bottoming tap is too short to successfully start into an unthreaded hole. In the US, they are commonly known as bottoming taps, but in Australia and Britain they are also known as plug taps.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} glass ceramic laser machining for cooktop appliances. <b>Blind</b> <b>holes</b> and special shape cross section <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> can be created for functional purposes. A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at its fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm with pulsewidths in the nanosecond range has been used. The material can be machined by focusing the laser beam at different depths under {{the back side of}} the glass panel, in such a way that <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> of 2 - 6 mm diameter and 1 - 3 mm depth can be drilled. Several cross section shapes can be obtained using additional galvanometric mirrors to deflect the laser beam in the desired direction, controlling the incidence angle. These holes can be used for fastening directly components to the glass panel, avoiding gluing processes, or for approaching thermal sensors to the upper surface, controlling the work temperature in a better way. Several tests have been performed to check the modifications in glass ceramic mechanical properties. Thermal tests have verified the improvement in work temperature accuracy measurement...|$|R

5000|$|Because boring {{is meant}} to {{decrease}} the product tolerances on pre-existing holes, several design considerations apply. First, large length-to-bore-diameters are not preferred due to cutting tool deflection. Next, through holes are preferred over <b>blind</b> <b>holes</b> (holes that do not traverse {{the thickness of the}} work piece). Interrupted internal working surfaces—where the cutting tool and surface have discontinuous contact—are preferably avoided. The boring bar is the protruding arm of the machine that holds the cutting tool(s), and must be very rigid.|$|R
