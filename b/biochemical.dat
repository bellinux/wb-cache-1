40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of our time is the substitution of the existing fossil based economy by a green economy {{within the framework of}} sustainable development of our society. Biomass, especially from lignocelluloses, is a promising solution for the substitution of fuels, energy, chemicals and materials from fossil sources in a so called &# 8213;Biorefinery&# 8214;. The production of <b>biochemicals</b> presents higher mass and carbon theoretical efficiency, and it seems an interesting alternative to provide a renewable path for globally and widely demanded platform chemicals like phenols, solvents (Acetone), soft plastic precursor (Polyethylene) and hard plastic precursor (Polypropylene). In this report, the environmental loads associated to the production of <b>biochemicals</b> (Phenolic compounds, Acetone, PolyHydroxyButyric Acid and Polylactic Acid) from lignocellulose biomass scenarios (Poplar and Eucalyptus) are evaluated and compared to the petrochemical equivalents. Life Cycle Assessment Methodology and the latest Global Warming Potential Indicator that accounts biogenic greenhouse gas effect related to the rotation period of the feedstock along the entire carbon cycle are used along this study. <b>Biochemicals</b> production could contribute to possible reductions between 37 % and 48 % on greenhouse gas emissions for the functional unit when taking into account the entire carbon cycle and not only from cradle to gate. Also, up to 80 % fossil fuel can be saved while ecotoxicity indicators present much lower values for <b>biochemicals</b> production. PHB seems to be the most environmentally friendly of all the <b>biochemicals,</b> and phenolic compounds the worst. But there are some trade-offs; <b>biochemicals</b> may increase other impact categories such Eutrophication and Acidification, but also Human toxicity, Photochemical Oxidant Formation and Particulate Matter Formation. Last but not least, water depletion is a fundamental issue involved, being substantially higher for <b>biochemicals,</b> even when irrigation of certain wood species may not occur. Decrease of fertilizers and irrigation, new solutions for disposal, treatment and recycling of ash and gypsum, increase of yields and production, energy efficiency techniques and a cleaner electricity mix, could bring the production of <b>biochemicals</b> to an status where they are dramatically better in all impact indicators if all the stakeholders on the life cycle of the <b>biochemicals</b> (Agriculture and Industry sectors, research institutions, policy makers and final customers) get involved. </p...|$|R

5|$|Most natural {{membranes}} are {{a complex}} mixture of different lipid molecules. If {{some of the}} components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase, the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions, rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean. This phase separation plays {{a critical role in}} <b>biochemical</b> phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated. One particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol, which modulates bilayer permeability, mechanical strength, and <b>biochemical</b> interactions.|$|E
5|$|An {{idea of the}} {{complexity}} of the metabolic networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes. However, it is now possible to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of <b>biochemical</b> reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior. These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and DNA microarray studies. Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which will guide future drug discovery and <b>biochemical</b> research. These models are now used in network analysis, to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or metabolites.|$|E
5|$|Both the mycelia and {{the fruit}} bodies of M.haematopus (both young and mature specimens) are {{reported}} to be bioluminescent. However, the luminescence is quite weak, and not visible to the dark-adapted eye; in one study, light emission was detectable only after 20hours of exposure to X-ray film. Although the <b>biochemical</b> basis of bioluminescence in M.haematopus has not been scientifically investigated, in general, bioluminescence {{is caused by the}} action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other <b>biochemical</b> functions, or it may help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E
40|$|The master thesis {{deals with}} {{determination}} of selected <b>biochemicals</b> (lignin, carotenoids, water) content in Norway spruce needles using laboratory and imaging spectroscopy. The {{first part of}} thesis summarizes literature dealing with methods of estimating lignin and other <b>biochemicals</b> content. Three types of data are used in this thesis: 1. spectra measured by contact probe and ASD FieldSpec 4 Wide Res spectroradiometer, 2. spectra measured by integrating sphere and spectroradiometer and 3. aerial hyperspectral image data acquired by APEX sensor. The most useful transformation methods - first derivative and continuum removal are applied to the spectrum. Further the linear relationship between measured spectrum and content of <b>biochemicals</b> is analysed. Stepwise multiple linear regression is applied to select suitable wavelengths for modeling of <b>biochemicals</b> content in spruce needles. The model is also calculated and applied {{on the level of}} image hyperspectral data. Maps of lignin content in Norway spruce are the final output of these part of this. Next part of the thesis compares spectra measured by contact probe and spectra measured by integrating sphere.
