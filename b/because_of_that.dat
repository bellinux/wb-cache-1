That same year, recon flights were conducted into Hurricane Inez, but there were no seedings.

With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{tensions}} in the western and southwestern states was the influx of Mexicans to the U.S. following the 1910 Mexican Revolution. Many Mexicans also smoked marijuana to relax after working in the fields. It was also seen as a cheaper alternative to alcohol, due to Prohibition (which went into effect nationally in 1920). Later in the 1920s, negative tensions grew between the small farms and the large farms that used cheaper Mexican labor. Shortly afterwards, the Great Depression came which increased tensions as jobs and resources became more scarce. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> {{the passage of the}} initial laws is often described as a product of racism, yet use of hashish by near eastern immigrants was also cited, as well as the misuse of pharmaceutical hemp, and the laws conformed with other legislation that was being passed around the country. Mexico itself had passed prohibition in 1925, following the International Opium Convention (see below).|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{during the}} 20th or 21st Dynasty Amenhotep's {{original}} tomb was either robbed or deemed insecure and emptied {{and his body}} was moved for safety, probably more than once. It {{was found in the}} Deir el-Bahri Cache, hidden with the mummies of numerous New Kingdom kings and nobles in or after the late 22nd dynasty above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut and is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. His mummy had apparently not been looted by the 21st dynasty, and the priests who moved the mummy took care to keep the Cartonnage intact. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> exquisite face mask, Amenhotep's is the only royal mummy which has not been unwrapped and examined by modern Egyptologists.|$|E

5|$|The McKeesport Olympics, a {{team from}} McKeesport, Pennsylvania, was the All-Americans next opponent. This game had to be played outside of Pennsylvania <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> state's blue laws which {{disallowed}} football on Sundays. In fact, {{this was one of}} only two away games for the Olympics. Hughitt scored a rushing touchdown in the first quarter to start the game. In the second quarter, Hughitt threw a touchdown pass to offensive lineman Heinie Miller to bring the All-Americans' lead to 14–0 going into halftime. The Olympics scored their only points of the game in the third quarter. A player with the last name of Schreiner caught a receiving touchdown. The All-Americans answered when offensive lineman Lou Little blocked a field goal and ran it back for a touchdown. The final score of the game came when Shelton caught a receiving touchdown in the fourth quarter from Hughitt.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{entered the}} 2010 season after a 2009 {{campaign}} {{that saw the}} team finish 10–3, including a season-ending win in the 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl against the Tennessee Volunteers. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> season-ending victory and the Hokies' general good performance during the 2009 season, Virginia Tech was ranked No. 10 in preseason national polling. The Hokies' {{first game of the}} season was a nationally televised contest against then-No. 3 Boise State at FedExField near Washington, D.C.. Because the game {{was the first of the}} season to feature two top-10 teams, it received large amounts of media coverage. During the game, Virginia Tech fell behind 17–0 in the first quarter, but rallied to take a 21–20 lead early in the third quarter. The two teams traded the lead, alternating scoring drives until Boise State scored a touchdown with 1:06 remaining. Virginia Tech was unable to reply one final time, and Boise State earned a 33–30 victory.|$|E
