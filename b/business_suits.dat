25|$|BMC programmers {{received}} commissions {{for their}} designs {{since the beginning}} of the firm. As a cost-saving measure from the early days of the company, sales were handled via direct mail and telemarketing. In 1991, BMC placed one-quarter of pretax revenues into the budget for research and development. The employees at the headquarters in Sugar Land, Texas often wore Hawaiian shirts rather than <b>business</b> <b>suits.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{people need}} to wear special clothes such as <b>business</b> <b>suits</b> or uniforms in their daily work. In some cases {{the nature of the}} cycling {{infrastructure}} and the prevailing weather conditions may make it very hard to both cycle and maintain the work clothes in a presentable condition. It is argued that such workers can be encouraged to cycle by providing lockers, changing rooms and shower facilities where they can change before starting work.|$|E

25|$|In fashion blue, {{particularly}} dark blue, {{was seen}} as a colour which was serious but not grim. In the mid-20th century, blue passed black as the most common colour of men's <b>business</b> <b>suits,</b> the costume usually worn by political and business leaders. Public opinion polls in the United States and Europe showed that blue was the favourite colour of over fifty per cent of respondents. Green was far behind with twenty per cent, while white and red received about eight per cent each.|$|E
25|$|What's My Line? {{is known}} for its {{attention}} to manners and class. In its early years, <b>business</b> <b>suits</b> and street dresses were worn by the host and panelists, but by 1953, the men normally wore black suits with bow ties (a few guests in fact wore tuxedos) while female panelists donned formal gowns and often gloves. Exceptions to this dress code were on the broadcasts immediately following the deaths of Fred Allen and Dorothy Kilgallen, in which the male cast members wore straight neckties and the women wore simpler dresses.|$|E
25|$|Suit jackets in all styles {{typically}} {{have three or}} four buttons on each cuff, which are often purely decorative (the sleeve is usually sewn closed and cannot be unbuttoned to open). Five buttons are unusual and are a modern fashion innovation. The number of buttons is primarily a function of the formality of the suit; a very casual summer sports jacket might traditionally (1930s) have had only one button, while tweed suits {{typically have}} three and city suits four. In the 1970s, two buttons were seen on some city suits. Today, four buttons are common on most <b>business</b> <b>suits</b> and even casual suits.|$|E

25|$|Traditional <b>business</b> <b>suits</b> are {{generally}} in solid colours or with pin stripes; windowpane checks are also acceptable. Outside business, {{the range of}} acceptable patterns widens, with plaids such as the traditional glen plaid and herringbone, though apart from some very traditional environments such as London banking, these are worn for business now too. The colour of the patterned element (stripes, plaids, and checks) varies by gender and location. For example, bold checks, particularly with tweeds, have fallen out of use in the US, while {{they continue to be}} worn as traditionally in Britain. Some unusual old patterns such as diamonds are now rare everywhere.|$|E
25|$|The binary gas {{reacts with}} {{chemicals}} in Sage's treated clothing and hair, {{causing them to}} change color. Sage's hair would change from red to black, or later to a darker red. Sage's treated clothing would change to light blue and orange, or later to dark blue. Some later versions of the gas caused no color change whatsoever. The faceless mask, combined with the color change of clothing, was sufficient to disguise Sage's identity to most onlookers. All of Sage's clothing was similarly treated. Originally Sage favored trench coats, <b>business</b> <b>suits,</b> and fedoras. Later he expanded his treated wardrobe, giving him a less standardized look.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous modern {{production}} was the centennial production of 1976, the Jahrhundertring, directed by Patrice Ch√©reau and conducted by Pierre Boulez. Set in the industrial revolution, it replaced {{the depths of the}} Rhine with a hydroelectric power dam and featured grimy sets populated by men and gods in 19th and 20th century <b>business</b> <b>suits.</b> This drew heavily on the reading of the Ring as a revolutionary drama and critique of the modern world, famously expounded by George Bernard Shaw in The Perfect Wagnerite. Early performances were booed but the audience of 1980 gave it a 45-minute ovation in its final year; the production is now generally regarded as revolutionary and a classic.|$|E

25|$|Puyi rarely {{left the}} Forbidden City, {{knew nothing of}} the lives of {{ordinary}} Chinese people, and was somewhat misled by Johnston who told him {{that the vast majority of}} the Chinese wanted a Qing restoration. Johnston, a Sinophile scholar and a romantic conservative with an instinctive preference for monarchies, believed that China needed a benevolent autocrat to guide the country forward, leading him to favor a Qing restoration. Johnston was enough of a traditionalist to appreciate that all of the major events in the Forbidden City were determined by the court astrologers as life in the Forbidden City was still decided by the way of the stars. The Sinophile Johnston disparaged the superficially Westernized Chinese republican elite who dressed in top hats, frock coats and <b>business</b> <b>suits</b> as inauthentically Chinese and praised to Puyi the Confucian scholars with their traditional robes as the ones who were authentically Chinese.|$|E

Despite wearing <b>business</b> <b>suits,</b> her character was known to climb {{on top of the}} announcers' table and dance sensually. It was also during this period that she began using what would become her trademark ring entrance: slowly putting her forty-two inch legs through the second tier of ropes, pausing to let the crowd momentarily see her panties. At 5feet 11inches, Keibler was one of few women in professional wrestling tall enough to step over the middle of the three ropes that surround the ring.|$|E

500|$|In 1998, Marshall rejoined Jarrett in the WWF.

In late 1998, Jarrett began a feud with Goldust that culminated in December at [...] in a [...] "Striptease match". During the match, Debra hit Goldust over the head with Jarrett's trademark guitar, enabling Jarrett to win. WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels, however, disqualified Jarrett, and Debra had to strip due to the match's stipulations. As she stripped, The Blue Blazer and Jarrett covered her up. Debra, however, began utilizing a new strategy during matches, distracting Jarrett's opponents by unbuttoning her blouse.

500|$|Adam's most {{significant}} influence following his death {{is in the}} next episode [...] "Restless", where the cost of defeating Adam is made apparent. Buffys fourth season was a first in the series in that the Scoobies' defeat of the Big Bad did not occur in a two-part grand season finale. [...] "Primeval" [...] is not the last episode of the season. Joss Whedon felt so strongly {{about the importance of}} the four core characters that he dedicated the finale to exploring their development. [...] "Restless" [...] opens with Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles arriving at Buffy's mother's house still brimming with the energy of the spell that bound them together in [...] "Primeval". Each of them falls asleep quickly, however, and their dreams are a pastiche of enigmatic episodes that both reveal much about each character, but also foreshadow what will occur in seasons to come. Their dreams also mirror their roles in the spell they performed to kill Adam. The magic they used to defeat the influence of science creates an inverse crisis, violating the series' set of laws. Both Riley and Adam, now only in human form, appear in Buffy's dream. They are wearing <b>business</b> <b>suits,</b> sitting together at a glass conference table as Buffy walks into the room, telling her they are naming things‚Äîas Adam did in the Garden of Eden‚Äîand making plans to take over the world. Buffy asks Adam what his name was before he was a monster, but he cannot tell her. Adam appears once more in the series as one of the faces of the First Evil, the seventh season's Big Bad, in [...] "Lessons".|$|E
2500|$|In clothing, a suit {{is a set}} of {{garments}} {{made from}} the same cloth, usually consisting of at least a jacket and trousers. Lounge suits (also known as <b>business</b> <b>suits</b> when sober in colour and style), which originated [...] in Britain as country wear, are the most common style of Western suit. Other types of suit still worn today are the dinner suit, part of black tie, which arose as a lounging alternative to dress coats {{in much the same way}} as the day lounge suit came to replace frock coats and morning coats; and, rarely worn today, the morning suit.
