2500|$|During sexual arousal, and {{particularly}} the stimulation of the clitoris, {{the walls of the}} vagina lubricate. This begins after ten to thirty seconds of sexual arousal, and increases in amount the longer the woman is aroused. It reduces friction or injury that can be caused by insertion of the penis into the vagina or other penetration of the vagina during sexual activity. The vagina lengthens during the arousal, and can continue to lengthen in response to pressure; as the woman becomes fully aroused, the vagina expands in length and width, while the cervix retracts. With the upper two-thirds of the vagina expanding and lengthening, the uterus rises into the greater pelvis, and the cervix is elevated above the vaginal floor, resulting in tenting of the mid-vaginal plane. This is known as the tenting or <b>ballooning</b> <b>effect.</b> [...] As the elastic walls of the vagina stretch or contract, with support from the pelvic muscles, to wrap around the inserted penis (or other object), this stimulates the penis and helps to cause a man to experience orgasm and ejaculation, which in turn enables fertilization.|$|E

The treaty contemplates a substitution policy that offers financial incentives and social investment to the coca-growing communities to replace their illicit crops by legal alternatives. This study examines the substitution policy tradeoffs in the Putumayo-Caquetá and the Catatumbo regions, by applying Life Cycle Assessment framework coupled with socioeconomic indicators, to four scenarios. Implications of coca cultivation and its derivatives (Business-as-Usual scenario) were evaluated and contrasted with the successful implementation of the policy (Policy Success scenario), a partial substitution of the illegal crops (Conservative scenario) and the geographical displacement of coca cultivation (<b>Balloon</b> <b>Effect</b> scenario). Compared to the Business-as-Usual scenario, Policy Success, and Conservative scenarios mitigate photochemical oxidation, ozone layer and abiotic resources depletion environmental impacts in both regions. In contrast, acidification and eutrophication in the Catatumbo region and toxicity impacts in the Putumayo-Caquetá region worsen. For both regions, <b>Balloon</b> <b>Effect</b> scenario increases the environmental burden in almost all the categories evaluated. The socioeconomic analysis reveals that for the Catatumbo region farmers, successful implementation of the policy implies a reduction on their income.

Three types of silicone materials, Ecoflex 0030 and 0050 and Dragonskin 0030, have been investigated, and a constitutive model has been derived for each of them. Design optimization of the silicone module was based on finite element analysis (FEA) that was validated against experimental data of one-degree bending under one-channel actuation. This was followed by FEA parametric studies for module design optimization to minimize the <b>ballooning</b> <b>effect</b> in one-degree bending as well as reduce the actuation pressure. Modules made from Ecoflex 0030 and Ecoflex 0050 exhibited the same bending shape in FEA, but about three times higher actuation pressure was required for the harder Ecoflex 0050. Design parameters under investigation in the parametric FEA studies included the shape of the pneumatic channel cross section, the ratio of channel length to module length, the distance of channel from the module wall, and the ratio of channel to module cross-sectional area. After FEA design optimization yielded least ballooning for pneumatic chambers of semicircular cross section, an internal dragonskin structure was added internally below the module surface to enable and guide the bending under one-channel pneumatic actuation and further contain the ballooning effect: the benefits of this design were successfully verified under both FEA and experimental analysis...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Bioreactor {{landfill}} {{operation has}} been promoted {{as a means of}} accelerating the degradation of waste for over 30 years. Accelerating the degradation of waste enables better predictability in biogas production and reduces aftercare costs. Most bioreactor landfill trials focus on the effect of leachate recirculation on otherwise conventional landfill cells. However, there is a range of design and operational measures that can be implemented with standard landfilling machinery to further enhance degradation. This thesis explores degradation rates that can be achieved in a landfill cell, designed to maximise degradation rate, with the constraint that it be constructed by standard earthmoving equipment, the waste be crudely shredded by sheep foot compactors to expose waste, and leachate recirculation be operable by landfill personnel. The major departures of these test cells from a conventional landfill cell operation were: the cells were only 3 m deep; MSW loaded into the cell was crushed and bags ruptured with a sheep foot compactor; MSW was pre-mixed prior placement with digested sludge, as a ratio such that the buffering capacity of the sludge was equivalent to an amount of NaHCO 3 known to successfully buffer the digestion of packed beds of MSW (10 gL- 1 NaHCO 3 in packed bed at field capacity moisture content plus excess leachate equal to 10 % of the bed volume (Lai et al 2001); and the waste was placed rather than compacted into the cell. The thesis examines the performance of two test cells, the second only containing MSW and inoculated and buffered by sequencing with the first. These performances are compared with an exhaustive set of control digestions in 200 L laboratory reactors. The laboratory reactors were packed with 50 kg sub-samples of the waste used in the cells, shredded to sub 5 cm size. The laboratory reactors primarily focussed on the effect of temperature on degradation rates, to identify the optimum degradation rate for this sludge and MSW mixture. The laboratory scale reactors produced 231 L and 202 L of methane per kgVS at the mesophilic temperatures of 38 °C and 45 °C respectively. The degradation was faster in the 45 °C reactor where methane production was completely exhausted after 35 days. A laboratory reactor operated at 55 °C reactor showed little degradation activity. The pH of this reactor was initially over 8. 5, and ammonia inhibition was suspected. However, the reactor did not respond to pH adjustments with hydrochloric acid, and subsequent step decreases in temperature did not have an effect until 47 °C, where degradation suddenly accelerated. This suggests the methanogenic consortia in the sludge could not adapt to thermophilic temperatures. This was confirmed in the 63 °C reactor which acidified and did not produce methane, until leachate from this reactor was transferred to the 45 °C reactor where an established methanogenic community converted the soluble COD to methane. In order to compare laboratory reactor performance with the general literature, pure cellulose was added in a fed-batch fashion to the stabilised 38 °C and 47 °C leach-beds. The beds were fed under starved conditions, to clearly distinguish degradation products from the cellulose from background levels. This also allowed for the estimation of biomass growth by measuring the uptake of NH 4 -N, as all other bio-available N sources such as protein and amino acids were reduced to NH 4 -N under these starved conditions. Hydrolysis rates were determined to be 0. 12 ± 0. 01 d- 1 and 0. 14 ± 0. 026 d- 1 at the 38 °C and 47 °C temperatures. Degradation in the two test cells was completed within a 7 month period. Temperature in the cells was maintained between 25 – 30 °C by biological activity, levels that were above ambient temperatures, but below ideal mesophilic conditions. Methane composition rapidly approached 50 % in both cells, and biogas flow rates were consistent with a degradation timeframe in the order of less than year. Full flow rate data was not obtained from these trials due to mechanical problems with flow meters, however vigorous gas production was evident throughout the trial by monitoring gas composition, and the <b>ballooning</b> <b>effect</b> of the top cover. To confirm the degradation rates in the test cells, samples were collected from the second test cell and digested in laboratory reactors. Methane yields were only 2. 4 and 6. 4 L CH 4 kgVS- 1 confirming virtual exhaustion of biogas potential within 7 months of sequencing this MSW cell with the first MSW:sludge test cell. This is the first systematic experimental program that places the degradation performance of a test cell {{in the context of the}} potential degradation rate achievable with fine shredding, temperature control and thorough inoculation and buffering. Economically, in cases where degradation residues are left insitu as in landfills, the degradation enhancement in the test cells would effectively yield as much benefit as enhancing the degradation rate to a two to three week timeframe typical of an anaerobic digester (Clarke 2000) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Pirn winding is an {{operation}} of winding yarn from supply yarn package onto pirns {{which are used}} for shuttle weft insertion. Firm and coherent winding tension is required to maintain in the pirn winding process to withstand the high forces produced by the deceleration of the shuttle {{at the end of}} each pick and to avoid permanent strains in yarns which will appears as fabric defects in weaving. The package size and its diameter vary due to subsequent winding of pirns. Hence the <b>balloon</b> <b>effect</b> varies and caused to change the thread tension at the winding point of the pirn. The thread tension variation is considerably significant from the first pirn wound from a package to the last pirn wound from the same if no tension controlling mechanism is devised. Placing dead weights on the disc tension controller which adds a tension to take off tension may help to compensate the yarn tension variation to some extent to combat with this problem. However, this is a stepwise manual compensation technique which needs the correct timing of compensation to avoid significant tension variations in pirn windings. The author attempted to theoretically analyze the tension variation in the yarn path of the pirn winding machine and theoretically model the tension variation with and without deadweight placement on the tensioners. Author also verified the accuracy and the validity of the model developed through the experimental results obtained at different locations along the yarn path. ...|$|R

A model predictive of the radial expansion experienced by a balloon-stent-vessel system under internal pressure was developed. Seven parametric stent configurations modeled after the Boston Scientific TAXUStm Express 2 tm stent were generated in Pro/Engineer 4. 0 which varied in strut cross section. These stents were expanded using finite element package ABAQUS/CAE 6. 7 under non-linear, large deformation conditions. An elasto-plastic, Ramberg-Osgood material model for 316 L stainless steel with two different work hardening exponents was used. Radial expansion vs. internal pressure data was collected in each simulation. The blood vessel expansion behavior was analytically developed using a hyperelastic model borrowed from existing literature.

30|$|The {{reservoirs}} in {{the study}} area could be described as calcareous quartz siltstones/sandstone within the N’kapa Formation due to the heterogeneous matrix which consists of fine-grained sand, limestone and dolomite. Petrophysical evaluation carried out on the wireline logs indicate four (4) reservoirs which are discontinuous and non correlatable across the entire wells. The identified reservoirs are probably thin stratigraphic sand beds which thin out and were deposited either as channel sands or as short turbiditic events characterizing the N’kapa Formation. All the reservoirs are hydrocarbon bearing with oil as the available phase in reservoir X 2 as suggested by the absence of the <b>balloon</b> <b>effect</b> and a density of 0.8. The reservoirs identified from petrophysical evaluation are discontinuous and non correlatable across the entire wells. They present average porosities, hydrocarbon-saturation and permeability in excess of 20 %, 69 % and 76  md, respectively, suggesting favourable petrophysical parameters for hydrocarbon accumulation and preservation based on the classification of (Rider 1986). They are probably thin stratigraphic carbonate prone sandy beds pinch-outs that were deposited either as channel sands or as short turbiditic events typical of the N’kapa Formation (Simon Petroleum Technology (SPT) 1995). The bulk volume water (BVW) values indicate that formation grain size ranges from fine grained to silty sands. BVW values calculated and plotted on crossplot as established by Asquith and Gibson (1982) are constant or closed to constant and parallel to the hyperbolic lines, thus suggesting that the reservoir are homogeneous and are at irreducible water saturation (Swirr) and hence will produce water-free hydrocarbon. When a reservoir is at Swirr, water will not move because it is held on grains by capillary pressure (Morris and Biggs 1967). Hydrocarbon production from a reservoir at Swirr should be water-free (Asquith and Krygowski 2004). The chlorite mineral could either be linked to detrital chlorite influx from neighbouring river sediments during fast deposition and/or probably formed diagenetically during early diagenesis of feldspar and mica sediments on the sea floor.|$|R

40|$|Organized {{crime and}} illegal economies {{generate}} multiple threats to states and societies. But although {{the negative effects}} of high levels of pervasive street and organized crime on human security are clear, the relationships between human security, crime, illicit economies, and law enforcement are highly complex. By sponsoring illicit economies in areas of state weakness where legal economic opportunities and public goods are seriously lacking, both belligerent and criminal groups frequently enhance some elements of human security of the marginalized populations who depend on illicit economies for basic livelihoods. Even criminal groups without a political ideology often have an important political impact on the lives of communities and on their allegiance to the State. Criminal groups also have political agendas. Both belligerent and criminal groups can develop political capital through their sponsorship of illicit economies. The extent of their political capital is dependent on several factors. Efforts to defeat belligerent groups by decreasing their financial flows through suppression of an illicit economy are rarely effective. Such measures, in turn, increase the political capital of anti-State groups. The effectiveness of anti-money laundering measures (AML) also remains low and is often highly contingent on specific vulnerabilities of the target. The design of AML measures has other effects, such as on the size of a country’s informal economy. Multifaceted anti-crime strategies that combine law enforcement approaches with targeted socio-economic policies and efforts to improve public goods provision, including access to justice, {{are likely to be more}} effective in suppressing crime than tough nailed-fist approaches. For anti-crime policies to be effective, they often require a substantial, but politically-difficult concentration of resources in target areas. In the absence of effective law enforcement capacity, legalization and decriminalization policies of illicit economies are unlikely on their own to substantially reduce levels of criminality or to eliminate organized crime. Effective police reform, for several decades largely elusive in Latin America, is one of the most urgently needed policy reforms in the region. Such efforts need to be coupled with fundamental judicial and correctional systems reforms. Yet, regional approaches cannot obliterate the so-called <b>balloon</b> <b>effect.</b> If demand persists, even under intense law enforcement pressures, illicit economies will relocate to areas of weakest law enforcement, but they will not be eliminated...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of two second-generation ablation techniques, bipolar radio-frequency impedance-controlled endometrial ablation (NovaSure) and balloon ablation (ThermaChoice), {{in the treatment of}} menorrhagia. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomised, controlled trial. SETTING: A large teaching hospital with 500 beds in The Netherlands. POPULATION: Women suffering from menorrhagia referred by their general practitioner. METHODS: Women suffering from menorrhagia, without intracavitary abnormalities, were randomly allocated to bipolar radio-frequency ablation (bipolar group) and balloon ablation (balloon group) in a 2 : 1 ratio. At follow up, both women and observers were unaware of the type of treatment that had been performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was amenorrhea at 3, 6 and 12 months after randomisation. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-six women were included in the study, of which 83 were allocated to the bipolar group, and 43 to the balloon group. No complications occurred in either of the treatment groups. At the one-year follow up stage, amenorrhea rates were 43 % (34 / 83) in the bipolar group and 8 % (3 / 43) in the <b>balloon</b> group (treatment <b>effect</b> in time P < 0. 001). At this stage, 90 % of the patients in the bipolar group were satisfied with the result of the treatment against 79 % in the <b>balloon</b> group (treatment <b>effect</b> in time P= 0. 003). CONCLUSION: The bipolar radio-frequency impedance-controlled endometrial ablation system is more effective than balloon ablation in the treatment of menorrhagi...|$|R
