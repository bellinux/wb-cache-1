40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to explore the {{suitability}} of the complementary use of mass spectra and the corresponding statistical analysis (principal components-Pareto analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis (DA)) of these spectra to differentiate diverse humic samples {{as a function of}} their structural and conformational features. To this end, the mass spectra of humic samples belonging to the main humic fraction types (gray humic <b>acid,</b> <b>brown</b> humic <b>acid,</b> and fulvic acid) were obtained by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The results obtained showed that the application of PCA yielded a clear separation between blanks and humic samples. However, a clear differentiation among the humic fraction types was not achieved. The DA of PCA data, however, yielded a clear separation among the humic substances (HS) samples belonging to each HS fraction type considered: gray humic <b>acids,</b> <b>brown</b> humic <b>acids,</b> and fulvic acids. These results showed that the mass spectra of each humic sample include characteristic mass/charge (m/z) distribution values that can be considered as a >fingerprint> representative of its specific structural features. Our results also indicate that, although the m/z values principally corresponded to single-charged ions, we cannot identify these molecular weight distributions with those of humic samples, since sample molecular fragmentation, as well as partial molecular ionization, cannot be ruled out under our experimental and instrumental conditions.

The data collected consisted of dry matter productions level of zinc in the leaves, stems and tootes of the corn {{as well as the}} P/Zn and Ca/Zn rations in the leaves. Phosphate fertilization and liming lowed the level of zinc in the corn leaves to a point equal to or lower than 14 ppm. These leves were below 80 % of the maximum yields of the experiments. The application of 4, 5 ppm of zinc to the soil was adequate to raise the level of zinc in the leaves above the critical level. It also increase the production was limited by a zinc deficiency. The phosphorus and zinc interaction, which ocurred primarily in the roots of the plant, reduced the translocation of zinc to the leaves. The interaction between liming and zinc ocurred prior to the absorption of zinc by the plant. It aprears that there are ratios between phosphorus and zinc between calcium and zinc in the leaves which are critical to good plant growth.

40|$|The {{organic and}} mineral horizons {{of a forest}} <b>brown</b> <b>acid</b> soil sampled in Belgium (Haute Ardenne, Vielsalm) were artificially contamined with a {{solution}} of (CsCl) -Cs- 137. If the sequential extractions (CaCl 2, NH 4 Ac, CuCl 2 and HNO 3, 1 N) realised on a pure mineral substrate remove 40 % of the total Cs- 137 content, the same reagents can only remove 8 % of total caesium when they react with the organic substrate (Of + OAh). Other controlled experiments with the different layers of the soil profile show, on the other hand, that if a pool of Cs- 137 is available for exchange in the Of and B horizons (31 and 18 %, respectively, of total caesium for NH 4 Ac), the quantities of exchangeable Cs- 137 (CaCl 2 and NH 4 Ac) and the present one in soil solution of the transition OAh and Ah horizons are near zero (0. 1 and 2. 7 % of total caesium for NH 4 Ac, respectively). This result seems to contradict the available quantities of potassium cation.

3000|$|It was {{verified}} by EDXS analysis that the carbon content (i.e. carboxylate impurities) {{is higher in}} those NAAMs fabricated in malonic acid ([...] Additional file 1 : Figure S 3). This can be observed also by a noticeable change in colour between NAAMs fabricated in oxalic (yellow) and malonic (bright <b>brown)</b> <b>acids</b> ([...] Additional file 1 : Figure S 4). Another question is that, as was demonstrated in section 3.2, the outer layer thickness (i.e. layer with carboxylate impurities) is thinner for those NAAMs produced in malonic acid. Therefore, the concentration of carboxylate impurities is rather higher in these NAAMs (i.e. thinner outer layer with more carboxylate impurities). These two factors imply that the screen effect of the outer layer is more effective in NAAMs produced in malonic acid (i.e. higher disturbance of the light transmittance from the excitation source and the light emission from the oxygen vacancies) [1]. In addition, the oxygen vacancies {{in the structure of}} NAAMs fabricated in malonic acid are lower than that of those produced in oxalic acid because of the reduction in the oxygen evolution, tensile stress and electrostriction pressure at high anodization voltage.|$|R
40|$|Background and aims: Soil {{incorporation}} of charcoal (biochar) {{has been suggested}} as practice to sequester carbon, improve soil properties and crop yields but most {{studies have been done}} in the short term. Old anthropogenic charcoal-rich soils in the Alps enable to explore the long-term impact of charcoal addition to alpine grassland on seed germination, fertility and fodder nutritive value. Methods: A germination test and a growth experiment in pots with Festuca nigrescens Lam. and Trifolium pratense L. were performed using three different substrates: control soil (i. e. sandy-loam <b>brown</b> <b>acid</b> soils with some podsolization), charcoal hearth soil (i. e. charcoal-enriched anthropogenic soils derived from the carbonization of larch wood on flat terraces) and control soil mixed with a fraction of fresh larch wood charcoal to reach the soil-charcoal ratio of 0. 6. Results: Both aged and fresh charcoal improved germination and markedly increased plant growth of the two plant species. The addition of fresh charcoal had an initial detrimental effect that disappeared {{in the second and third}} growth cycles. Plant Nitrogen:Phosphorus ratio revealed that growth was N-limited in the anthropogenic soils and P-limited in the control and freshly amended soils demonstrating that biochar aging is critical to obtain a significant growth stimulation. Plant nutrient contents revealed an improved fodder quality in both the charcoal amended soils. Conclusions: Despite the occurrence of limited toxic effects on seedlings, larch wood charcoal appears to have positive effects on fertility and fodder quality of alpine grasslands in the long term...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a preliminar one on {{objectives}} {{of a new}} project in terrestrial ecology and {{on the characteristics of}} selected study area. The project is being drived by Ecology departments of Universitat de Barcelona and Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, and is embodied in a larger one on nutrient cycles in forest ecosystems. The parameters measured and their relationships are exposed and future developments briefly discussed. The La Castanya valley is included in the Montseny nature park, a Biosphere Reserve, in a Mediterranean mountain stage with relatively humid climate but with great interanual fluctuation. The bedrock is nearly all constituted by paleozoic shales and valley-side slopes are pronounced (30 %). There is a soil catena from litosols to rankers and <b>brown</b> <b>acid</b> soils that can be lixiviated in some places. Vegetation is a green oak mountain forest (Quercetum ilicis mediterraneo-montanum) in nearly all the valley. There are, however, some grasslands and a beech forest near the summits and also a little Taxus baccata trees clump. The green oak forest is a young one, in a regeneration stage, after a very intensive explotation period (wood for fuel and coal making) interrupted some years ago, and an early farming period. In the experimental plot direct insolation is lowered by topographic position and the soil is colluvial, deep but with loose rocks at surface. Herb and shrub layer are poor, being the young Quercus ilex also dominants. The experimental plot surface is 0, 22 ha, including 450 trees (more than 5 cm dbh) between 7 and 12 m high. The branch system has a lowe layer level, with a few horizontal branches, and a higher one with near vertical branches.

40|$|The macromorphological and {{physicochemical}} characteristics of fersialitic soils from the Corbas plain {{and from the}} Saint Symphorien d'Ozon, Villete de Vienne and Pont Eveque depressions (Lyon-Vienne area), are explained, indicating their relict nature. Profiles, one from the «fersialitic with calcic reserve. group located on a fluvioglacial terrace probably dating from the fini-Wurmian period, and two from the «fersialitic» without calcic reserve,, group on moraines which show signs of cryoturbation, and of an older pedogenesis, Riss-Wurm or perhaps Mindel-Riss, are presented. The first one shows a pH of between 7 and 7, 2, a saturation level greater than 65 % and a clay illuviation index of more than 1 / 1, 4. But from the iron illuviation index and the lower level of saturation -V- in the horizon B 3 (50, 3), it would perhaps be necessary to consider this soil as being a stage between the fersialitics with calcic reserve and those without it. From its colour it should perhaps be placed between the brown and the red fersialitics. The second profile corresponds to a reddish <b>brown</b> <b>acid</b> fersialitic soil (pH less than 5), only slighthly illuviated and devoid of calcic reserve. Judging by the pH {{it belongs to the}} IX/ 22 group (CPCS, 1967) but from the clay illuviation index which is greater than 1 / 1, 4 it resembles the IX/ 21 group. Thus, it seems like a IX/ 22 -IX/ 21 slightly illuviated fersialitic intergrade. The third profile described, a red acid fersialitic soil without calcic reserve, would also be taxonomically better classified as being between IX/ 21 and IX/ 22, due partly to the pH value and the dose of iron liberation in the horizon B, and partly to the exceedingly high values of the saturation complex as well as the clay illuviation index which is greater than 1 / 1, 4...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnitude}} of radiocaesium fixation by micaceous clay minerals {{is affected by}} their transformation, which depends on weathering in soil. The net retention of radiocaesium traces was quantified by sorption-desorption experiments in the various horizons of four sandy soils forming an <b>acid</b> <b>brown</b> earth-podzol weathering sequence derived from sandy sediments and characterized by marked changes in mineral composition. The features of the 2 : 1 minerals of the four soils, resulting from an aluminization process in depth and a desaluminization process towards the surface, had a strong influence on Cs+ fixation. Beneath the desaluminization front, which deepens from the <b>acid</b> <b>brown</b> earth to the podzol, hydroxy interlayered vermiculite was dominant and the 137 Cs+ fixation was the weakest.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the data obtained {{during a period}} of 3 years in 'in situ' (distribution of the Chernobyl radiocesium fallout in a Belgian Ardenne spruce stand) and in controlled conditions (spruces growing in contaminated lysimeters and in nutrient media). Experiments in controlled conditions show that deposited radiocesium (thermogenetated aerosols) is washed out very quickly; the short ecological half-lives are confirmed by the post-Chernobyl observations in the NPP contaminated zone. Moreover, field observations reveal that spruce contamination levels remain more or less stable, with seasonal variations (translocation of cesium- 137 during the spring and storage in the wood trunk and in the old needles during the winter). Studies conducted on throughfall water pointed out a high seasonally significant correlation between K and cesium- 137. Studies of the cycles of stable K and Cs in needles and throughfall water sampled monthly for a year, confirm that radiocesium movements in trees are closely related to the potassium cycle and to the tree physiological status. Five years after the accident, forests seem to be at a steady state without any significant decontamination, throughfall losses being compensated by root absorption. On the other hand, field experiments conducted on spruce litter show that in Belgium, litter decomposition is a very slow process: K and Cs losses are quite negligible after 400 days. These results emphasize the radiological role of the litter. The relative distribution of deposited radioactivity in the different compartments of the forest ecosystem is given, the soil compartment being the main reservoir of radioactivity (particularly the upper Of and OAh organic soil horizons). Soil-tree transfer factors obtained in lysimeters contaminated by cesium- 137 (calculated on the soil solution basis) range from 4 to 40 depending on the soil solution concentration of the different soil layers exploited by the root system. Cesium exchangeable fractions (CaCl 2 and NH 4 Ac) represent up to 15 % of the total soil activity.
