Four different boxes of varying sizes and similar board com binations, made from similar flute but different manufacturers were studied.

The com pression strength of control boxes were compared to overall strength of a three-high stack and in three different offset configurations. In ad dition, a set of perfectly aligned <b>boxes</b> <b>stacked</b> three high were com pression tested for comparison with control and mis-aligned <b>stacked</b> <b>boxes.</b> The <b>stack</b> configurations were offset either in the length, width or diagonally (both length and width) with an offset distance of 12. 7 mm, 25. 4 mm or 38. 1 mm (0. 5, 1, and 1. 5 inches).

Vision systems, tactile sensors, proximity switches and other sensors provide the elements necessary for simple game playing as well as industrial applications. These sensors permit adaption to a changing environment. The AI techniques permit advanced forms of decision making, adaptive responses, and learning while the manipulator provides the ability to perform various tasks. Computer languages such as LISP and OPS 5, have been utilized to achieve expert systems approaches in solving real world problems.

40|$|Abstract — Deploying robots {{for service}} tasks {{requires}} learn-ing algorithms that scale to the combinatorial complexity {{of our daily}} environment. Inspired by the way humans decompose complex tasks, hierarchical methods for robot learning have attracted significant interest. In this paper, we apply the MAXQ method for hierarchical reinforcement learning to continuous state spaces. By using Gaussian Process Regression for MAXQ value function decomposition, we obtain probabilistic estimates of primitive and completion values for every subtask within the MAXQ hierarchy. From these, we recursively compute proba-bilistic estimates of state-action values. Based on the expected deviation of these estimates, we devise a Bayesian exploration strategy that balances optimization of expected values and risk from exploring unknown actions. To further reduce risk and to accelerate learning, we complement MAXQ with learning from demonstrations in an interactive way. In every situation and subtask, the system may ask for a demonstration {{if there is not}} enough knowledge available to determine a safe action for exploration. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to efficiently learn solutions to complex tasks on a <b>box</b> <b>stacking</b> scenario. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Muscle {{strength}} {{is important for}} young people with Down syndrome as they {{make the transition to}} adulthood, because their workplace activities typically emphasise physical rather than cognitive skills. Muscle {{strength is}} reduced up to 50 % in people with Down syndrome compared to their peers without disability. Progressive resistance training improves muscle strength and endurance in people with Down syndrome. However, there is no evidence on whether it has an effect on work task performance or physical activity levels. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate if a student-led community-based progressive resistance training programme can improve these outcomes in adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome. Methods A randomised controlled trial will compare progressive resistance training with a control group undertaking a social programme. Seventy adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome aged 14 - 22 years and mild to moderate intellectual disability will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control group using a concealed method. The intervention group will complete a 10 -week, twice a week, student-led progressive resistance training programme at a local community gymnasium. The student mentors will be undergraduate physiotherapy students. The control group will complete an arts/social programme with a student mentor once a week for 90 minutes also for 10 weeks to control for the social aspect of the intervention. Work task performance (<b>box</b> <b>stacking,</b> pail carry), muscle strength (1 repetition maximum for chest and leg press) and physical activity (frequency, duration, intensity over 7 -days) will be assessed at baseline (Week 0), following the intervention (Week 11), and at 3 months post intervention (Week 24) by an assessor blind to group allocation. Data will be analysed using ANCOVA with baseline measures as covariates. Discussion This paper outlines the study protocol for a randomised controlled trial on the effects of progressive resistance training on work task performance and physical activity for adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome. The intervention addresses the impairment of muscle weakness which may improve work task performance and help to increase physical activity levels.

40|$|Goal {{extraction}} {{in learning}} by demonstration {{is a complex}} problem. A novel approach, inspired by developmental psychology and focused on use in experiments with naive users, is presented in this paper. Participants were presenting a simple task, how to <b>stack</b> three <b>boxes,</b> to the humanoid robot iCub. The stationary states of the task - 1 <b>box,</b> 2 <b>boxes</b> <b>stacked,</b> 3 <b>boxes</b> <b>stacked</b> - were defined and the time span of each state was measured. Analysis of {{the results showed that}} there is a significant result that users tend to keep the boxes stationary longer upon completion of the end goal than upon completion of the sub-goals. A simple and straightforward learning algorithm was then used on the demonstration data, using only the time spans of the stationary states. The learning algorithm successfully detected the end goal. These temporal differences, functioning as emphasis, {{could be used as a}} complementary mechanism for goal extraction in imitation learning. Furthermore, it is suggested that since a simple, straightforward learning algorithm can use these pauses to recognise the goal state, humans may also be able to use this pause as a complementary mechanism for recognising the goal state of a task. ?? 2013 IEEE...|$|R

50|$|The wing box, a 54-plane {{formation}} (basically three 18-plane <b>boxes</b> <b>stacked</b> in {{a similar}} fashion to the group box), evolved from a need to provide defensive fire against head-on attacks. The formations were stacked so that while squadrons were stacked away from the sun on missions, groups were stacked in the opposite direction, making for a more compact wing box. Because the Eighth AF had only four B-17 units until May 1943, composite groups were formed by combining squadrons from different groups, or a fourth group was added to the wing box to form a diamond-shaped box. The latter was flown in a trailing position behind the wing and proved susceptible to Luftwaffe tactics of attacking the extremities of formations. The wing box was often spread 3000 ft vertically, 7000 ft deep, and 2000 ft across and was difficult to maintain.|$|R
