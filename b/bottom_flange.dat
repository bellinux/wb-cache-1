50|$|An {{issue with}} the T-beam {{compared}} to the I-beam {{is the lack of}} the <b>bottom</b> <b>flange.</b> In addition, this makes the beam not as versatile because of the weaker side not having the flange making it have less tensile strength.|$|E
50|$|In the {{longitudinal}} direction, the spans consist of continuous beams.

30|$|Therefore, {{lateral support}} and support frames were {{designed}} using a ball caster and circular rod, shown in Fig.  2. The circular support rod can move laterally {{to adjust the}} width of the beam and is fastened to act as a lateral support condition. The ball caster, which is in contact with the side surface of the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>flanges</b> of the beam, contains grease to minimize friction resistance at the contact surface of the ball caster and the circular rod. The top and bottom ball casters, which provide lateral support to the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>flanges</b> of the beam, respectively, is free to move up and down, as well as rotate when the rotations about the strong and weak axes occur in the beam. Therefore, the in-plane and out-of-plane rotations of a beam are unconstrained at the support locations.|$|R

50|$|The T-beam {{has a big}} {{disadvantage}} {{compared to}} an -beam because it has no <b>bottom</b> <b>flange</b> with which to deal with tensile forces.

50|$|An I-joist has {{two main}} parts, {{the web and}} flange. The web is {{sandwiched}} between a top and <b>bottom</b> <b>flange,</b> creating the “I” shape. The flange {{can be made from}} laminated veneer lumber or solid wood finger-jointed together for ultimate strength. It is grooved on one side to receive the web. The web is typically made from plywood, laminated veneer lumber, or oriented strand board. After sizing the webs and flanges, they are assembled with water-resistant glue by pressing the web into the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>flange.</b> After assembly, the I-joist is end-trimmed and heat-cured or left at room temperature to reach approximately equilibrium moisture content. Sizes vary according to the I-joist's intended load and span. Depths can range from 9.25 to 24 in and reach up to 80 ft in length, although 40 to 42 ft is more common. The intended use for an I-joist is for floor and roof joists, wall studs and roof rafters in both residential and commercial construction.|$|E
5000|$|This drive towards {{lightening}} {{was based}} on a misunderstanding of the component's mechanical behaviour. The assumption for a H girder was that all of the resistance to bending stresses was carried in the two top and <b>bottom</b> <b>flanges</b> of the girder, with the central web only carrying out a spacing function. The central web could thus be drilled indiscriminately, supposedly without weakening the overall girder. This {{was based on}} two fallacies: firstly that the only forces on the beam were simple bending forces in the plane of the web. In practice, a more complicated force, such as an unexpected torsional twisting from a sudden suspension bump overloaded the now-weakened central web and the lightened beam failed immediately. Secondly, the assumption that the ideal forces were separated into the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>flanges</b> was increasingly unrealistic with the development of stressed skin and monocoque designs, where loads were more evenly shared. In these designs there was no [...] "unloaded web" [...] that could be safely drilled.|$|R

They consist of two {{vertical}} webs, short top flanges {{on top of each}} web, and a wide <b>bottom</b> <b>flange</b> connecting the webs together. A box girder is particularly resistant to torsion and, while expensive, are utilized in situations where a standard girder might succumb to torsion or toppling effects.|$|E
50|$|The T-beam, though simple in design, {{contains}} multiple design {{elements of}} interest. Unlike an I-beam, a T-beam lacks a <b>bottom</b> <b>flange,</b> which carries savings {{in terms of}} materials, but {{at the loss of}} resistance to tensile forces. In parking garages, however, it is obvious that this lack of a <b>bottom</b> <b>flange</b> on a T-beam actually serves as an advantage in that the stem rests on shelf making the flange the upper deck. T- beam designs come in many sizes, lengths and widths depending on what the structure is and its compression tension needs. However, the simplicity of the T-beam is in question by some who would rightly test more than one complex structure; for example, a group of researchers tested pretension inverted T-beams with circular web openings, with mixed but generally favorable results. Thus, in some cases, the extra time and effort invested in creating a more complex structure proves worthwhile. A simpler matter to consider is that of which material or materials make up the construction of T-beams.|$|E

40|$|Recent extreme wind {{events such}} as {{tropical}} cyclones and severe storms have shown that thin steel roof battens fail prematurely at their screw connections to the rafters or trusses. The screw heads connecting the <b>bottom</b> <b>flanges</b> of thin steel roof battens to the rafters or trusses often pull through the roof batten <b>bottom</b> <b>flanges.</b> Since such localised pull-through failures occur in the lower level of roof connections, they often cause {{the loss of the}} entire roofing system during extreme wind events. Therefore detailed experimental and numerical studies were conducted at the Queensland University of Technology, and suitable test, design and strengthening methods were developed to accurately design the roof batten to rafter/truss connections and to enhance the roof batten performances under wind uplift loads. However, the levels of possible damages at community level due to the pull-through failures of roof battens are still unknown. Therefore fragility curves were developed in this study to determine the likely level of roof damage during extreme wind events, based on the governing pull-through failures of thin steel roof battens. Detailed probabilistic analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted for this purpose. Fragility curves were also used to evaluate the effects of roof batten span and spacing and, levels of enhancement that could be achieved with the strengthening method proposed for roof battens. This paper presents the details of this study on the development of fragility curves and the results...|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{the depth}} of the girder is no less than 1/15 the span, and for a given load bearing capacity, a depth of around 1/12 the span {{minimizes}} the weight of the girder. Stresses on the flanges near the centre of the span are greater than {{near the end of the}} span, so the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>flange</b> plates are frequently reinforced in the middle portion of the span. Vertical stiffeners prevent the web plate from buckling under shear stresses. These are typically uniformly spaced along the girder with additional stiffeners over the supports and wherever the bridge supports concentrated loads.|$|E
50|$|In the half-through bridge (also {{called a}} pony truss), the bridge deck is {{supported}} between two plate girders, often {{on top of}} the <b>bottom</b> <b>flange.</b> The overall bridge then has a 'U'-shape in cross-section. As cross-bracing cannot normally be added, vertical stiffeners on the girders are normally used to prevent buckling (technically described as 'U-frame behaviour'). This form of bridge is most often used on railroads as the construction depth (distance between the underside of the vehicle, and the underside of the bridge) is much less. This allows obstacles to be cleared with less change in height.|$|E

30|$|For small-scaled I-beams, the {{critical}} loads {{obtained from the}} proposed experimental method were in good agreement with those calculated using the analytical equations. The strains in the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>flanges,</b> which were under compression and tension, respectively, were induced by the in-plane flexure.

Therefore, the neutral axis in the concave side moves from the centroid of the cross-section {{up to the top}} flange. The proposed experimental method, validated in the linear and elastic range of material, could be further applied to the lateral and torsional stability testing of flexural members accounting for various parameters, such as material nonlinearity, shapes and sizes of geometry, and boundary conditions.|$|R

5000|$|A simple {{vertical}} crack with {{a freshly}} fractured surface and old rust {{marks on the}} face was easily distinguished {{to the side of}} the centre joint, extending from the <b>bottom</b> <b>flange</b> to the top of the girder. This was associated with a casting defect hidden behind a surface skin of sound metal at the thickest part of the section where the flanges met the web. This was described by the accident report as a large honeycomb, or drawhole, which measured 3½ ins (c 90 mm) across at the face, and narrowed to about l½ ins (c 40 mm). inside , 2⅜ ins (c 60 mm) in extreme depth and 6ins (c 150 mm). in extreme length, extending inwards and downwards ...but not within 1 ½ ins of the outer face of the joint flange. The total capacity of the hole, measured by filling it with water, was 15 ½ cubic inches (about 250 ml) and, as the metal immediately round the hole was not sound, this amount does not measure the actual extent of the flaw. [...] There were other signs of poor foundry practice when the girder had been cast; honeycombing elsewhere, a cold shut (incomplete fusion between different streams of filling metal), and residual stresses in the girder web (as a consequence of which, when sample cores were being drilled for testing, the web (but not the flanges) fractured along the line of holes. Whilst the metal appeared to be of good quality to the naked eye, the tested tensile strength of the metal varied widely from the lowest of ~4.5 tsi (c 70 MPa) (close to the honeycombing) with a mean of 7.5 tsi (c 115 MPa).The accident report says that the girder if sound would have had a breaking strength of 80 tons and concludes that the theoretical strength of the girder was ‘above but only just above’ the Board of Trade requirement (live load x 6 + dead load x 3) (However this appears inconsistent with the figures quoted by the report for dead weight (21 ton shared between 2 girders) and live load (21 ton shared between two girders))The actual strength fell below this because of the casting defect; [...] "The sectional area of the <b>bottom</b> <b>flange</b> would at one place be reduced from 36 (sq) ins to only 28 (sq) ins, thus enormously reducing the strength of the girder" ...|$|E
50|$|Built in 1950, the Patton Bridge {{spans the}} Green River {{near the city}} of Auburn in King County, Washington. The bridge is a three-span {{cantilever}} with two anchor arms, two cantilever arms and a suspended section. It includes a combination of concrete and steel box girders. The bridge was designed by Homer M. Hadley, a consulting engineer from Washington State.The anchor arms and cantilever arms are multiple box, two-cell reinforced concrete box girders. The suspended section consists of two spread, welded steel box girders with reinforced concrete deck. The concrete deck is fixed to the top flange plate of the girders with steel shear developers. Utilization of this deck design allows the concrete deck and steel box girders to act in composite design; i.e., the <b>bottom</b> <b>flange</b> of the steel box resists tensile forces while the concrete deck resists compressive forces.The Patton Bridge's anchor arms are 115 ft feet long, the cantilever arms are 50 ft long, and the suspended span is 100 ft.
