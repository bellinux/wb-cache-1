In this episode, Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) and Sub-commander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) travel back to early 21st century Earth to find a group of Xindi-Reptilians who were seeking to wipe out the human race by using a <b>biological</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E

5|$|Diseases {{which can}} be {{transmitted}} from one organism to another are known as infectious diseases, and the causative <b>biological</b> <b>agent</b> involved {{is known as a}} pathogen. The process by which the pathogen is introduced into the body is known as inoculation, and the organism it affects is known as a biological host. When the pathogen establishes itself in a step known as colonization, it can result in an infection, consequently harming the host directly or through the harmful substances called toxins it can produce. This results in the various symptoms and signs characteristic of an infectious disease like pneumonia or diphtheria.|$|E

Bravo Team survivor Rebecca Chambers joins Chris. The player character eventually learns that a series of illegal experiments was being undertaken by a clandestine research team under the authority and supervision of biomedical company Umbrella Corporation.

40|$|<b>Biological</b> <b>agents</b> {{are unique}} class of {{microorganisms}} {{which can be}} used to produce the disease in large populations of humans, animals and plants. If used for hostile purposes, any disease-causing microorganism could be considered a weapon. The use of <b>biological</b> <b>agents</b> is not a new concept and history is replete with examples of biological weapon use. Before the 20 th century, biological warfare took on three main forms by deliberate poisoning of food and water with infectious material, use of microorganisms or toxins in some form of weapon system, and use of biologically inoculated fabrics. Four kinds of <b>biological</b> warfare <b>agents</b> are bacteria, viruses, rickettsiae, fungi. These are distinguished by being living organisms, that reproduce within their host victims, who then become contagious with a deadly multiplier effect, bacteria, viruses, or fungi or toxin found in nature can be used to kill or injure people. <b>Biological</b> <b>agents</b> may be used for an isolated assassination, as well as to cause incapacitation or death to thousands. These <b>biological</b> <b>agents</b> represent a dangerous military threat because they are alive, and are therefore unpredictable and uncontrollable once released. The act of bioterrorism can range from a simple hoax to the actual use of <b>biological</b> weapons. <b>Biological</b> <b>agents</b> have the potential to make an environment more dangerous over time. If the environment is contaminated, a long-term threat to the population could be created.

25|$|In general, a {{pesticide}} is {{a chemical}} or <b>biological</b> <b>agent</b> (such as a virus, bacterium, antimicrobial, or disinfectant) that deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests.

Although pesticides have benefits, some also have drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other species. According to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, 9 of the 12 most dangerous and persistent organic chemicals are organochlorine pesticides.|$|E

25|$|Entomological warfare (EW) is a {{specific}} type of biological warfare (BW) that uses insects in a direct attack or as vectors to deliver a <b>biological</b> <b>agent,</b> such as plague or cholera. Essentially, EW exists in three varieties. One type of EW involves infecting insects with a pathogen and then dispersing the insects over target areas. The insects then act as a vector, infecting any person or animal they might bite. Another type of EW is a direct insect attack against crops; the insect may not be infected with any pathogen but instead represents a threat to agriculture. The final method of entomological warfare is to use uninfected insects, such as bees, to directly attack the enemy.|$|E
40|$|Background: The paper {{presents}} the intentional use of <b>biological</b> <b>agents</b> for industrial, diagnostic and research purposes in Polish enterprises. Material and Methods: The National Register of <b>Biological</b> <b>Agents</b> (Krajowy Rejestr Czynników Biologicznych – KRCB) is an online database that collects {{the data on}} the intentional use of <b>biological</b> <b>agents</b> at work in Poland. Results: As of December 2013 there were 533 notifications in KRCB, mainly for diagnostic (73 %), research (20 %) and industrial purposes (7 %). Mostly there were hospital diagnostic laboratories (37 %), and other laboratories (35 %), as well as higher education and research institutions (11 %). In total, 4015 workers (91. 7 % of women, 8. 3 % of men) were exposed to <b>biological</b> <b>agents.</b> Agents classified in risk group 2 were used in 518 enterprises, and in risk group 3 in 107 enterprises. Of those agents the following bacteria were the most frequently used: Escherichia coli except for non-pathogenic strains (455 enterprises and 3314 exposed workers); Staphylococcus aureus (445 and 3270); and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (406 and 2969, respectively). In 66 enterprises there were used <b>biological</b> <b>agents</b> recognized by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as carcinogens. They are viruses: Epstein-Barr (7 enterprises, 181 exposed workers); hepatitis B (16 and 257); hepatitis C virus (15 and 243); human immunodeficiency virus (8 and 107); human papillomaviruses (2 and 4); parasites: Clonorchis viverrini (1 and 2); Clonorchos sinensis (1 and 2); Schistosoma haematobium (1 and 2) and bacteria Helicobacter pylori (15 and 230, respectively). Conclusions: The National Register of <b>Biological</b> <b>Agents</b> at Work permits to evaluate the situation of occupational exposure to <b>biological</b> <b>agents</b> used intentionally in enterprises in Poland.

25|$|Despite its pest {{status and}} notoriety, the red {{imported}} fire ant can be beneficial. The ant {{is an effective}} insect predator, so it {{may serve as a}} <b>biological</b> <b>agent</b> against other pest species, especially in sugarcane fields. Pest insects the ant kills include: boll weevils (Anthonomus grandis) in cotton crops, sugarcane borers (Diatraea saccharalis) in sugarcane fields, horn flies (Haematobia irritans) in manure, velvetbean caterpillars (Anticarsia gemmatalis) in soybeans, and whiteflies that are found in greenhouses. A number of studies indicate that red imported fire ants do not interfere or attack insects of economic importance in cotton fields, which has resulted in many farmers in the southeastern regions of the United States viewing red imported fire ants as beneficial. However, some scientists have suggested that the beneficial status of the red imported fire ant is hard to predict when geography, plant size, season, soil moisture and the use of insecticides are not considered. These factors may lower the efficacy of red imported fire ants as pest control agents. Another factor is that workers are indiscriminate and kill beneficial insects such as predators that eat horn flies and other pests in pastures and predators of aphids and scale insects. They also reduce the efficacy of parasitic wasps against pest species by eating the larvae and pupae.|$|E
