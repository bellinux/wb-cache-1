500|$|Rowling {{has said}} that her teenage years were unhappy.

Rowling later said that she based the character of Hermione Granger on herself when she was eleven. Steve Eddy, her first secondary school English teacher, remembers her as [...] "not exceptional" [...] but [...] "one {{of a group of}} girls who were bright, and quite good at English". Sean Harris, her <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> the Upper Sixth, owned a turquoise Ford Anglia which she says inspired a flying version that appeared in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

500|$|Both Schooley's and McCorkle's own daughters {{inspired}} them {{to conceive}} Kim as [...] "a character that our daughters and other girls {{can look up}} to", all-the-while aware of the [...] "ancient truism" [...] that while girls seldom hesitate to watch a show about a male lead, boys are usually less {{willing to do the}} opposite. Thus, the writers decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making Kim the show's competent action hero and Ron her [...] "fumbling" [...] sidekick, longing to provide young girls with [...] "a character that they can pretend to be" [...] similar to their own childhood heroes, fictional spy James Bond and Captain Kirk from Star Trek. According to McCorkle, Kim has much more in common with James Bond than comic book superheroes. The recurring character Monique was created because Schooley and McCorkle felt that it would be more realistic if Kim had a female <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> addition to Ron.|$|E

500|$|The primary {{race was}} bitter. Miller called McEwen [...] "Pinocchio," [...] and McEwen said of Miller, [...] "His misrepresentations and falsehoods are gargantuan. I {{tried to be}} his <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> the delegation. I am deeply {{disappointed}} at the meanness of his effort." [...] Tom Deimer of Cleveland's Plain Dealer wrote that the two candidates were largely identical on the issues: [...] "both are textbook Republican conservatives, opposed to abortion, gun control, high taxes, and costly government programs — unless located in their districts." [...] Miller noted he had no overdrafts at the House bank, saying, [...] "the score is 166 to nothing." [...] McEwen said [...] "every one of my checks was free and clear. Every month's statement had a balance." [...] McEwen ran commercials against Miller claiming the long-time congressman [...] "has fallen {{out of touch with}} Ohio" [...] and [...] "doesn't live in our district and isn't even registered to vote here." [...] Miller struck back in a live-television interview by taking a Wheat Thin, claiming it to be McEwen, and then taking a bite out of it.|$|E
500|$|In December 1990, Gaven {{once again}} {{appeared}} as Nancy in {{a revival of}} Oliver!—this time in a production at 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle, Washington. A theatre critic for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer noted that she [...] "has the voice to anchor anything you'd care to name, even the 5th Avenue Theatre. 5th Avenue performers often sound {{as if they were}} speaking and singing through a football stadium public address system. But Mitzman overpowers malevolent acoustics." [...] After Oliver!, she appeared as Countess Charlotte Malcolm in Ahmanson Theatre's production of A Little Night Music that was performed from April 18 to June 30, 1991 at James A.

Mitt Romney, former Massachusetts Governor and Kennedy's opponent in the 1994 senate race, called Kennedy [...] "the kind of man you could like even if he was your adversary" [...] and former First Lady Nancy Reagan said she was [...] "terribly saddened". [...] She went on, [...] "Given our political differences, people are sometimes surprised how close Ronnie and I have been to the Kennedy family.... I will miss him." [...] Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the President pro tempore of the Senate, issued a statement on Kennedy's death in which he said [...] "My heart and soul weeps at the loss of my <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> <b>in</b> the Senate, my beloved friend, Ted Kennedy."
