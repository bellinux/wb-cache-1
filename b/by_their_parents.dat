5|$|There were at most 20,000 comfort women. None of {{them were}} {{forcibly}} recruited. Forty percent {{of them were}} from Japan, the most heavily represented nation.

I would add that, on the average, living conditions in the comfort stations were practically identical to those in brothels set up for American troops during the Vietnam War.|$|E

5|$|As {{was common}} {{practice}} with upper-class {{children of the}} time, Edward and his younger siblings were brought up by nannies rather than directly <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b> One of Edward's early nannies often abused him by pinching him before he was due to be presented to his parents. His subsequent crying and wailing would lead the Duke and Duchess to send him and the nanny away. The nanny was discharged after her mistreatment of the children was discovered.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Fear is {{the last}} of the {{well-known}} Four Freedoms oil paintings produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell. The series was based on the four goals known as the Four Freedoms, which were enunciated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in his State of the Union Address on January 6, 1941. This work was published in the March 13, 1943, issue of The Saturday Evening Post alongside an essay by a prominent thinker of the day, Stephen Vincent Benét. The painting is generally described as depicting American children being tucked into bed <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> while the Blitz rages across the Atlantic in Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, a {{wide variety}} of causes have contributed to the condor's decline. Its low clutch size (one young per nest), {{combined}} with a late age of sexual maturity, make the bird vulnerable to artificial population decline. Significant past damage to the condor population has also been attributed to poaching, especially for museum specimens, lead poisoning (from eating animals containing lead shot), DDT poisoning, electric power lines, egg collecting, and habitat destruction. During the California Gold Rush, some condors were even kept as pets. The leading cause of mortality in nestling condors is the ingestion of trash that is fed to them <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b>|$|E
5|$|This kiwi {{is highly}} aggressive, and pairs will defend their large territories (49 acres) against other kiwi. Great spotted kiwi are nocturnal, and will sleep {{during the day}} in burrows. At night, they feed on {{invertebrates}} and will also eat plants. Great spotted kiwi breed between June and March. The egg is the largest of all birds {{in proportion to the}} size of the bird. Chicks take 75 to 85 days to hatch, and after hatching, they are abandoned <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{the female}} lays the egg, the male incubates the egg while the female guards the nest. Males only leave the nest {{for a few}} hours to hunt, and during this time, the female takes over. It takes 75 to 85days for the egg to hatch. The kiwi chick takes 2 to 3 days simply to get out of its egg. Kiwi chicks are precocial, and are {{abandoned}} <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> after hatching. After ten days, chicks venture out of the burrow to hunt. Most chicks are killed by predators {{in the first six months}} of their life. Great spotted kiwis reach full size at year six. Unlike most birds, female great spotted kiwis have two ovaries. Most birds have only one. Great spotted kiwis are distinguishable from other kiwi species by the fact that they can only produce one egg a year, as it takes so much energy to produce the massive egg.|$|E
5|$|By 24–28days after hatching, {{the young}} birds start to perch on {{branches}} near the nest {{and take their}} first flight. They are fed <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> for a further 28–30days, staying close to the nest while growing and practicing flying. At this stage they are extremely vocal, and their cries to their parents can often be heard a considerable distance away. The young hawks disperse after their parents stop provisioning them. Though they receive {{the same amount of}} food, male chicks (roughly half the size of females) mature more quickly and seem to be ready to leave the nest sooner. In a study in the Forest of Ae, south-west Scotland, it was found that 21% of nestlings over two days old died, with the causes of death being starvation, wet weather, predation and desertion by the parents. The parasite Leucocytozoon toddi can be passed from parent to nestling at the nest, possibly {{because of the number of}} birds sharing a small space, thus allowing transmission.|$|E
5|$|Following the Surrender of Japan to the Allied forces, Japanese {{military}} personnel and civilians were repatriated to Japan between 1945 and 1946, although some 350 labourers and technicians were permitted to remain behind to carry out repair works to Palau's infrastructure. However, offspring of Japanese-Palauan intermarriages were allowed to remain, although a few migrated to Japan with their fathers. In the 1950s, Japanese-Palauans formed an organisation, Sakura-kai to assist Japanese-Palauans and Japanese youths who were abandoned <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> to search for their parents and kinsmen who were forcibly separated {{as a result of}} forced repatriation of Japanese settlers back to Japan. The organisation became a cultural organisation from the 1980s onwards, as most Japanese-Palauans had reunited with their Japanese families or voluntarily chose to leave certain family separations as they were.|$|E

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how Bruce was employed {{after his return}} from Spitsbergen in autumn 1899. In his whole life he rarely had settled salaried work, and usually relied on patronage or on influential acquaintances to find him temporary posts. Early in 1901 he evidently felt sufficiently confident of his prospects to get married. His bride was Jessie Mackenzie, who {{had worked as a}} nurse in Samuel Bruce's London surgery. Bruce's marriage took place in the United Free Church of Scotland, in Chapelhill within the Parish of Nigg on 20 January 1901, being attended and witnessed <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b> Perhaps, due to Bruce's secretive nature presenting limited details even among his circle of close friends and colleagues, little information about the wedding has been recorded by his biographers.|$|E

Conran had been out of film school for two years and was trying to figure out how to make a movie. He figured that Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E
