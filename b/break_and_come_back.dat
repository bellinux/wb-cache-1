2500|$|Benny {{even had}} a sound-based running gag of his own: his famous {{basement}} vault alarm, allegedly installed by Spike Jones, ringing off with a shattering cacophony of whistles, sirens, bells, and blasts, before ending invariably {{with the sound of}} a foghorn. The alarm rang off even when Benny opened his safe with the correct combination. The vault also featured a guard named Ed (voiced by Joseph Kearns) who had been on post down below before, apparently, the end of the Civil War, the end of the Revolutionary War, the founding of Los Angeles, on Jack's 38th birthday, and even the beginning of humanity. In one appearance, Ed asked Benny, [...] "By the way, Mr. Benny...what's it like on the outside?" [...] Benny responded, [...] "...winter is nearly here, and the leaves are falling." [...] Ed responded, [...] "Hey, that must be exciting," [...] to which Benny replied (in a stunningly risqué joke for the period), [...] "Oh, no—people are wearing clothes now." [...] In one episode of the Benny radio show, Ed the Guard actually agreed when Jack invited him to take a <b>break</b> <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to the surface world, only to discover that modern conveniences and transportation, which hadn't been around the last time he'd been to the surface, terrorized and confused him. (Poor Ed thought a crosstown bus was [...] "a red and yellow dragon".) Finally, Ed decides to return to his post fathoms below and stay there. The basement vault gag was also used in the cartoon The Mouse that Jack Built and an episode of The Lucy Show.|$|E

We started working on the songs the day I met them, because I wanted to get a vibe from them. We did the three songs in five days".|$|R
50|$|The match {{began with}} Benfica {{starting}} quickest {{in the starting}} blocks, in the opening 45 minutes Benfica dominated the ball possession creating several chances. Benfica scored after creating several changes thanks to an attack by Bruno César down the left wing in which he crossed in the box for Rodrigo to open the scoring 30 minutes into the game. Benfica went into the <b>break</b> leading 1-0 <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> into the second half dominating again {{as they did in}} the first half. In the 78th minute, Gil Vicente got a corner which they capitalized from after several blocked attempts from Benfica's defence; Zé Luís put the ball in the back of the net, beating Benfica goalkeeper Eduardo. Six minutes later, the winning goal came from Benfica substitute Javier Saviola after Gil Vicente's goalkeeper blocked Axel Witsel's shot, which led to the ball falling to the Argentine in which he slotted the ball home into the opposition's empty goal.

500|$|Writing for The Times, {{journalist}} David Chater highlighted The Most Hated Family in America among selections for [...] "Chater's Choice". Chater commented, [...] "Louis Theroux [...] undertakes his ugliest {{assignment to}} date." [...] Chater concluded, [...] "Theroux deploys all his logic and charm {{to find the}} humanity beneath the rhetoric, but ultimately fails. It is difficult to reason with {{people who think that}} holding up a placard proclaiming 'Jews worship the rectum' is 'a courteous and loving' thing to do." [...] The film was highlighted in the Liverpool Echo as [...] "Sunday's: Pick of the day". Peter Grant of the Liverpool Echo commented, [...] "Louis Theroux took a trip to Kansas for his documentary, The Most Hated Family in America. His profile of Westboro Baptist Church, the home of America's most fanatical Christian fundamentalists, was astonishing." [...] Karl French of Financial Times selected the film as his [...] "Critic's Choice". French wrote positively of the documentary, [...] "After painting himself into an oddball- documentary corner a few years back, Theroux wisely took a long <b>break,</b> <b>and</b> he's <b>come</b> <b>back</b> refreshed, as confirmed by this film. In the way it reveals the comic horror inherent in all forms of zealotry, it is every bit as compelling as Theroux's recent Vegas documentary." [...] The Mail on Sunday critic Tom Cox rated the documentary as four out of four stars. Cox wrote of Theroux, [...] "His attempts to challenge the beliefs of the Phelps clan – a 71-strong congregation who picket military funerals with 'America Is Doomed' signs – and fuddle them with good nature and erudition were impressive, but ultimately as futile as an attempt to teach a cat algebra." ...|$|R

As Grosso explained it to a reporter, the crew tried to imitate the dirty and gritty streets of a typical city by [...] "... burning cars on the streets, spray-painting graffiti on buildings and using prop garbage.
