50|$|Because of {{its large}} size and {{velocity}} {{in case of}} danger (24 km/h escape speed), the oceanic manta ray has very few natural predators that could be fatal to it. Only large sharks and dolphins, such as the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), the great hammerhead shark (Sphyrna mokarran), the <b>bullshark</b> (Carcharhinus leucas), the False killer whale (Pseudora crassidens), and the killer whale (Orcinus orca), are capable of preying on the ray. Nonlethal shark bites are very common occurrences, with {{a vast majority of}} adult individuals bearing the scars of at least one attack.|$|E

50|$|The car {{mechanic}} Peter Riedl {{was killed}} in his Munich workshop. Through a hidden tattoo is clear that Riedl {{was a member of}} the Munich Chapters of the MC <b>Bullsharks.</b> One trail leads to the leader of the chapter, Frank Wellinger.Another trail leads to the lawyer Paul Korte. He represents the co-plaintiff in a process that takes place in a few days in Leipzig. The dead man was there a witness for the defense. In the process, the head of the Cologne chapter of the <b>Bullsharks,</b> Alex Krüger, is indicted.|$|R

25|$|Sports {{teams in}} {{national}} and state-level competitions based at Bond include the Queensland Country team that {{plays in the}} National Rugby Championship, the Bond University Breakers rugby club that plays in the Queensland Premier Rugby competition, and the Bond University <b>Bullsharks</b> club that plays in the Queensland Football Association Division 1 (QFA Division 1) competition.|$|R
50|$|The {{stadium is}} {{adjacent}} to Robina railway station, {{providing access to}} other Gold Coast areas, and to Brisbane. Robina {{is also home to}} a duo of amateur Australian rules football clubs, the Robina Roos and the Bond University <b>Bullsharks.</b> Both clubs share a home ground on Scottsdale Drive and compete in the SEQAFL Division 2 and the SEQAFL Division 4 respectively.|$|R
25|$|In 2001, Lacuna had {{his first}} {{national}} competition {{at the age of}} 8 that, winning a gold medal in the 100 meter freestyle event. His first win at a national event took him into various other national competitions, including the Philippine Olympic Games. Bulacan <b>BullSharks</b> Swimming Club was lacuna’s first swimming club where he competed as a high school student at Bulacan State University Laboratory High School, division in 2005.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of their 2014 successes, the <b>Bullsharks</b> were {{promoted}} to the QAFA (A) division and impressively claimed another minor premiership in 2015, going undefeated in the home and away season. The club {{went on to win the}} 2015 QAFA (A) Grand Final against the South East Suns and in doing so made it back-to-back premierships in separate divisions. This success saw them promoted again to the QFA South competition for season 2016. 2015 also saw the launch of the women's team competing in the QWAFA competition. They compiled a 9-6 record in their inaugural season and made it to the preliminary final where they were defeated by the eventual premiers Zillmere.|$|R
40|$|Tiger Sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, {{are large}} {{top-level}} predators usually solitary as adults. Observation of their scavenging {{activity on the}} carcass of a dead whale offered a rare opportunity for better understanding the pattern of intra-specific behaviour within the aggregations of these large predators. In January 2002, the stranding, subsequent death and consumption of a 17. 4 ?m total length (TL) blue whale, Balaenoptera musculus, was observed and filmed in Prony Bay, southern New Caledonia. After three weeks of confinement in the bay, the cetacean was killed by adult <b>bullsharks</b> Carcharhinus leucas. The first adult Tiger Shark was subsequently observed around the carcass after 36 ?h. The fat slicks from the carcass attracted further Tiger Sharks which arrived after an additional 24 ?h. The use of photo-identification on video footage collected during four observation sessions over an eight-day period identified 46 individual Tiger Sharks (primarily adult females between 3. 3 and 4 ?m TL) participating in the feeding aggregation. Only four animals were identified in two seperate observation sessions (over two consecutive days), suggesting a short-term residency pattern of several hours (< 36 ?h) around the carcass. As the arrival time of Tiger Sharks to the carcass differed, most arrivals of a new participant were followed by a frenzied period of intense intra-specific interaction. Different biting and agonistic behaviours were demonstrated by the Tiger Sharks on the carcass, including three new behaviours previously undescribed for this species. Size and level of aggressiveness {{appeared to be the}} determining factors of dominance amongst Tiger Sharks. These observations and analysis demonstrate that systematic study of feeding aggregations supported by photo-identification could contribute to knowledge of large shark ecology when coupled with capture-recapture, genetic fingerprinting and tagging techniques.
