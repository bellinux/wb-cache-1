500|$|The {{album was}} {{noted for its}} [...] "dry, sterile" [...] production. Rasmussen said that was not his intention, as he tried for an ambient sound similar to the {{previous}} two albums. He was not present during the album's mixing, for which Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero had been hired beforehand. Rasmussen felt that, in his absence from the mixing process, Thompson and Barbiero ended up using only the close microphones on the mix {{and none of the}} room microphones, thus causing the [...] "clicking", thin drum sound. Popoff noted that because of the strange production, the bass guitar was nearly inaudible, while the guitars sounded [...] "strangled mechanistic". He saw the [...] "synthetic" [...] percussion as another reason for the album's compressed sound. The sound has nearly-inaudible bass guitar, which Rasmussen claims was ordered by Hetfield and Ulrich after hearing the initial mixes, resulting in his belief that [...] "Jason Newsted, [...] Toby Wright and I are probably the only people who know what the bass parts actually sounded like on that album". Thompson similarly blamed Ulrich for the inaudible bass, stating that Ulrich ordered him to remove the bass from the mix. In their defense, Hetfield and Ulrich said that most of Newsted's bass lines closely followed the rhythm guitar lines {{to the point of being}} indiscernible from each other. A lack of direction is also partly to blame; since the album was largely produced by the band, there was no one present in the studio to guide the band's new bassist and tell him what was expected of him, something a producer would typically do. Newsted was not satisfied with the final mixes: [...] "The Justice album wasn't something that really felt good for me, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> can't hear the bass." ...|$|E

If I had to begin over again, I should not expect anything at all, and then I should be sure of being radiantly happy. But all this talking and all this writing about love seems to turn our brains; we know that men are not perfect, even at our craziest, because women are not, but we expect perfection of them; and they seem to expect it of us, poor things!

5000|$|Upon release, Overlord II {{received}} on average a positive reception {{with an average}} critic average indicated as [...] "generally favorable" [...] at Metacritic (although the PS3 version was just under the score requirement), with most reviewers praising the multiple improvements over its predecessor while keeping core gameplay intact. 1UP.com complimented the game's premise, still kept enjoyable from the previous Overlord, that [...] "commanding a legion of hilariously evil little critters to plunder and wreck everything in reach is the game's most basic appeal, and something that never really seems to get old." [...] This linked in with the game's humour, particularly the minions' personality and charm, with GameSpy complimenting [...] "the maniacal Gremlin-esque voices and actions of the minions, making them at once both intimidating and strangely endearing", with the added feature of naming and resurrecting certain minions that resulted in [...] "a surprising attachment." [...] X-Play echoed this view alone with utilizing the hordes as [...] "addictive, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> do feel as if you're controlling your own private Gremlin horde." ...|$|E

The new songs were predominately written during soundchecks for the Sticks and Stones 10th Anniversary Tour, according to Gilbert. The guitarist explained, [...] "There is a reason why they {{are a little bit}} more energetic, because we’re on that tour and it’s just wild and we’re playing and you just start writing." [...] New song [...] "I Want to Believe" [...] is about [...] "that whole thing in music that’s going on and questioning a band’s integrity.

Are you willing to play in front of five people when the going gets rough, or is that not why you’re here? It’s about questioning bands’ intentions, I guess.

Newman qualified third, Kasey Kahne took fourth, and Biffle started fifth. Gordon, Bill Elliott, Casey Mears, Allmendinger and Keselowski rounded out the top ten. The driver that failed to qualify for the race was Robert Richardson, Jr. Once the qualifying session had concluded, Kenseth stated, [...] "The interesting thing about qualifying, at least for me today, was nobody had any idea what the pole was going to be or how fast anybody was. They lined qualifying up by first practice speeds, but that was drafting for everybody. So, you really didn't know what anybody was going to run. That's the same lap we ran during a mock-up qualifying run Friday, so I was glad we were able to repeat that, but I didn't know what anybody else was going to run.

5000|$|Critic Amy Klein {{writes that}} Davis' [...] "story {{serves as a}} {{dramatic}} counterpoint to certain beliefs about America that young Americans do not trust anymore: it is, and has always been, a myth that hard work and talent get a person ahead, but Llewyn Davis has to learn firsthand that he’s been fed a bunch of lies. In this way, he’s an excellent role model for millennials: a guy with talent and an independent spirit, broke but not yet broken, cynical as all hell but still doing what he loves anyway. Fate seems to love {{nothing more than to}} kick him when he’s down, and yet, he somehow gets up and keeps on going. Believe it or not, the art of failure is actually harder to master than it looks <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> have to keep on trying in order to fail consistently." [...] Christopher Orr of The Atlantic writes that, [...] "As an artist, he’s remote and self-absorbed, despite his clear talent. When he visits Chicago to play for the powerful manager Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham), the latter tells him [...] "I don’t see a lot of money here" [...] and implicitly compares him to a genial G.I.-turned-musician: [...] "He connects with people." [...] As a person, Llewyn is easily wounded and spectacularly selfish, an [...] "asshole" [...] who, among other trespasses, gets his best friend’s girl (Carey Mulligan) pregnant and then surreptitiously asks said best friend (Justin Timberlake) for money to pay for her abortion. Inside Llewyn Davis is thus simultaneously the name of the film, of Llewyn’s solo album, and of his psychological condition: He is himself trapped inside Llewyn Davis." ...|$|E
