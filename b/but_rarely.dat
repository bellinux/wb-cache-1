5|$|Charged leptons {{can combine}} with other {{particles}} to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium. The electron governs {{nearly all of}} chemistry, as it is found in atoms and is directly tied to all chemical properties. Neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed. Neutrinos stream throughout the Universe <b>but</b> <b>rarely</b> interact with normal matter.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} diagnosis is usually made based on recovery of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the pharynx. Antibodies to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally {{detected in the}} blood of infected patients early in the course of infection. Analysis of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is collected by a lumbar puncture ("spinal tap"), reveals an increased number of white blood cells (primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection of virus in the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio, <b>but</b> <b>rarely</b> occurs.|$|E

5|$|Blue whales may be {{encountered}} (<b>but</b> <b>rarely)</b> on whale-watching cruises in the Gulf of Maine and are {{the main}} attractions along {{the north shore of}} the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and in the Saint Lawrence estuary. Blue whales can also be seen off Southern California, starting as early as March and April, with the peak between July and September. More whales have been observed close to shore along with fin whales.|$|E
5|$|Bog turtles are {{omnivorous}} and eat {{aquatic plants}} (such as duckweed), seeds, berries, earthworms, snails, slugs, insects, other invertebrates, frogs, {{and other small}} vertebrates. They also occasionally eat carrion. Invertebrates such as insects are generally the most important food item. In captivity, a bog turtle can be fed a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as meat such as liver, chicken hearts, and tinned dog food. Bog turtles feed only during the day, <b>but</b> <b>rarely</b> during the hottest hours, consuming their food on land or in the water.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis {{is mostly}} {{based on the}} {{clinical}} appearance and the medical history. The most important diagnostic feature {{is a history of}} recurrent, self healing ulcers at fairly regular intervals. Although there are many causes of oral ulceration, recurrent oral ulceration has relatively few causes, most commonly aphthous stomatitis, <b>but</b> <b>rarely</b> Behçet's disease, erythema multiforme, ulceration associated with gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent intra-oral herpes simplex infection. A systemic cause is more likely in adults who suddenly develop recurrent oral ulceration with no prior history.|$|E

5|$|Goldfaden wandered Europe as a {{poet and}} journalist. His plays {{continued}} to be performed in Europe and America, <b>but</b> <b>rarely,</b> if ever, did anyone send him royalties. His health deteriorated – a 1903 letter refers to asthma and spitting up blood – and he {{was running out of}} money. In 1903, he wrote Jacob Dinesohn from Paris, authorizing him to sell his remaining possessions in Romania, clothes and all. This gave him the money to head once more to New York in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Humans likely first {{inhabited}} the South Florida region 10,000 to 20,000years ago. Two tribes of Native Americans developed on the peninsula's southern tip: the Tequesta {{lived on the}} eastern side and the Calusa, greater in numbers, on the western side. The Everglades served as a natural boundary between them. The Tequesta lived in a single large community near the mouth of the Miami River, while the Calusa lived in 30villages. Both groups traveled through the Everglades, <b>but</b> <b>rarely</b> lived within them, remaining mostly along the coast.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} regions, the locally dominant Fulani ethnic group is mostly Muslim, {{but the overall}} population is fairly evenly divided among Muslims, Christians, and followers of indigenous religious beliefs (called Kirdi ("pagan") by the Fulani). The Bamum ethnic group of the West Region is largely Muslim. Native traditional religions are practiced in rural areas throughout the country <b>but</b> <b>rarely</b> are practiced publicly in cities, in part because many indigenous religious groups are intrinsically local in character.|$|E

5|$|Individual feeding territories vary in {{size from}} , with the general {{concentration}} of coyotes in a given area depending on food abundance, adequate denning sites, and competition with conspecifics and other predators. The coyote generally does not defend its territory outside of the denning season, and is much less aggressive towards intruders than the wolf is, typically chasing and sparring with them, <b>but</b> <b>rarely</b> killing them. Conflicts between coyotes can arise during times of food shortage.|$|E
5|$|Orisini's {{election}} was notable {{at the time}} because it was unusual for the cardinals to elect friars, since they were seen by some as too rigid. Members of religious orders {{at the time were}} often respected by the cardinals, <b>but</b> <b>rarely</b> elected, with Benedict XIII being only the fourth since the Council of Trent. Unlike the other mendicants elected to the papacy in this period, he was of noble birth, being the eldest son of the Duke of Gravina, but had forfeited his rights to his father's title in order to enter the Dominicans.|$|E
5|$|TK is {{a mysterious}} {{character}} {{who wears a}} large bandanna over his eyes and tends to break out in dance every so often. No one knows his real name or past. He speaks in semi-nonsensical English phrases depending on the situation, mainly quoted from pop culture, but apparently does not know English fluently. He saves the team many times and does know some Japanese <b>but</b> <b>rarely</b> speaks it. He carries Browning Hi-Power and LAR Grizzly handguns or a PP-19 Bizon submachine gun during missions.|$|E

5|$|The National Rail {{station is}} officially named London Paddington, a name {{commonly}} used outside London <b>but</b> <b>rarely</b> by Londoners, who call it just Paddington, {{as on the}} London Underground map. This same practice applies to all the London mainline rail termini, except London Bridge. Parts of the station, including the main train shed, date from 1854, when it was built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel as the London terminus for the Great Western Railway (GWR). It is one of nineteen stations managed by Network Rail.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the late stage is marked {{by the use of}} simple 16-point patterns at the Hasan Sadaqah mausoleum in Cairo in 1321, and in the Alhambra in Spain in 1338–1390. These patterns are rarely found outside these two regions. More elaborate combined 16-point geometrical patterns are found in the Sultan Hasan complex in Cairo in 1363, <b>but</b> <b>rarely</b> elsewhere. Finally, 14-point patterns appear in the Jama Masjid at Fatehpur Sikri in India in 1571–1596, but in few other places.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{debate over the}} {{morality}} of the air campaign against Japan since World WarII. During the war the American public approved of the bombing of Germany and Japan, and {{the few people who}} criticized the raids were seen as unrealistic or even traitors. Some United States government and military personnel believed that the bombing campaign was morally ambiguous, however, <b>but</b> <b>rarely</b> voiced their views publicly.|$|E

5|$|These small {{whales are}} also {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is well adapted for hunting Arctic whales and calves. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Whales lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. This however means less room around the breathing hole as the ice slowly closes the gap. When out at sea, whales dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas. Polar bear attacks on belugas and narwhals are usually successful in winter, <b>but</b> <b>rarely</b> inflict any damage in summer.|$|E
5|$|Wolves {{are often}} infested {{with a variety}} of {{arthropod}} exoparasites, including fleas, ticks, lice, and mites. The most harmful to wolves, particularly pups, is Sarcoptes scabiei (or mange mite), though they rarely develop full blown mange, unlike foxes. Lice, such as Trichodectes canis, may cause sickness in wolves, <b>but</b> <b>rarely</b> death. Ticks of the genus Ixodes can infect wolves with Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The tick Dermacentor pictus also infests wolves. Other ectoparasites include biting lice, sucking lice and the fleas Pulex irritans and Ctenocephalides canis.|$|E
5|$|Zugzwang, disadvantageous {{since it}} forces {{a player to}} move, is often a factor in endgames <b>but</b> <b>rarely</b> in other stages of the game. In the example diagram, either side having the move is in zugzwang: Black to move must play 1...Kb7 {{allowing}} White to promote the pawn after 2.Kd7; White to move must permit a draw, either by 1.Kc6 stalemate or by losing the pawn after any other legal move.|$|E
