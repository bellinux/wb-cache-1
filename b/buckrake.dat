5000|$|A beaverslide {{will raise}} hay to a height {{that allows a}} haystack to be built as much as 30 feet high. A large hay crew is required, {{with a minimum of}} six people to operate all components. A load of hay is {{delivered}} {{to the base of the}} beaverslide, often pushed by a <b>buckrake</b> drawn by a team of horses or a tractor. The hay is loaded onto the rack, which when full is drawn up the inclined ramp by cables powered either by a second team of horses or a motorized vehicle such as a pickup or a tractor. At the top of the incline, the hay falls onto the stack and the rack is lowered for another load. The term [...] "butt" [...] describes the hay stacked by the beaverslide and has two meanings. A [...] "butt" [...] can be the amount of hay on a fully loaded rack, but the term also refers to the amount of hay that can be stacked by the beaverslide without moving it, roughly 24 tons of hay. The hay at the top of each haystack is stomped and piled higher towards the middle to allow rain to run off. Depending on the size of the field and the amount of hay produced per acre, once a beaverslide has created a stack, it can be moved a few feet to make a long, continuous haystack, or moved a longer distance to create multiple stacks within a field. Many are built on skids to facilitate being moved from field to field. If the hay is stacked properly, and remains uneaten, the hay in a beaverslide-constructed stack remains good at least two to three years, with some ranchers claiming it could last up to five or six years. In contrast, baled hay stored outdoors can begin to go bad after only one year.|$|E
