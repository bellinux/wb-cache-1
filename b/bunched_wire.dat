50|$|Aristida behriana is {{a native}} Australian species of grass {{commonly}} known as <b>bunch</b> <b>wire</b> grass or brush wire grass. It is a bright green perennial plant forming short, tufted tussocks up to 40 cm high. Its seeds have three long, radiating awns; it {{is a member of}} genus Aristida, grasses known commonly as three-awns. The species favours low fertility and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in mallee woodlands and plains, where it grows on sunny slopes. Superficially, the flower heads resemble those of the invasive weed African feather-grass (Pennisetum villosum). A. behriana is found in all mainland Australian States.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{demand for}} {{wireless}} communication is increasing day by day. People want a high speed of communication in less time. No one {{is interested in}} use of <b>bunch</b> of <b>wires.</b> So we move to wireless communication. As technology increases a demand also increases. Now everyone wants a fast communication from anywhere to anyone. Even rural area also requires internet facility. It is too hard to establish a Base station for particular small village for broadband communication or any wireless communication. Even it’s too costly to launch a satellite for particular rural area. So Engineers made a intermediate way to satisfy both facilities of data transfer from terrestrial to satellite and satellite to terrestrial via HAP (High Altitude Platform). HAP is operated at altitude of 17 - 22 km. HAP provides facilities of wireless communications. 1) Balloons: � The earliest aerial platforms were balloons. � It was filled by hydrogen. � It was used in military applications...|$|R
50|$|Physically, an {{electrical}} cable is an assembly consisting {{of one or more}} conductors with their own insulations and optional screens, individual covering(s), assembly protection and protective covering(s). Electrical cables may be made more flexible by stranding the wires. In this process, smaller individual wires are twisted or braided together to produce larger wires that are more flexible than solid wires of similar size. <b>Bunching</b> small <b>wires</b> before concentric stranding adds the most flexibility. Copper wires in a cable may be bare, or they may be plated with a thin layer of another metal, most often tin but sometimes gold, silver or some other material. Tin, gold, and silver are much less prone to oxidation than copper, which may lengthen wire life, and makes soldering easier. Tinning is also used to provide lubrication between strands. Tinning was used to help removal of rubber insulation. Tight lays during stranding makes the cable extensible (CBA - as in telephone handset cords).|$|R

We {{find that the}} maximum energy of emitted particles and their directionality is significantly enhanced {{in the case of}} nanostructured targets with respect to plane targets. We have studied theoretically in detail the generation and propagation of fast electrons in nanowire targets. Such targets exhibit an extraordinary high conversion efficiency of laser energy into electron kinetic energy.

The question of the wurtzite distribution in the sample is addressed using phase-sensitive coherent X-ray diffraction with a micro-focused beam at a synchrotron source. The simultaneous investigation of the wurtzite 101 ̅ 0, 202 ̅ 0 and 303 ̅ 0 reflections performed on a <b>bunch</b> of single <b>wires</b> shows unambiguously that the wurtzite contribution is a result of stacking faults distributed along the wire. Additional simulations lead to adjustments of the wire structural parameters, such as the wurtzite content, the strain distribution, the wire diameters and their respective orientations...|$|R
50|$|Most older PCs use flat ribbon cables {{to connect}} storage drives (IDE or SCSI). These large flat cables greatly impede airflow by causing drag and turbulence. Overclockers and modders often replace these with rounded cables, with the {{conductive}} <b>wires</b> <b>bunched</b> together tightly to reduce surface area. Theoretically, the parallel strands of conductors in a ribbon cable serve to reduce crosstalk (signal carrying conductors inducing signals in nearby conductors), {{but there is}} no empirical evidence of rounding cables reducing performance. This may be because the length of the cable is short enough so that the effect of crosstalk is negligible. Problems usually arise when the cable is not electromagnetically protected and the length is considerable, a more frequent occurrence with older network cables.|$|R

40|$|Objective. The {{purpose of}} the study is to analyze the errors, {{complications}} and outcomes of the operative treatment of patients with femoral neck fracture in the 1 st group with application of wires bundle and fixation in the llizarov frame (64 cases) and in the 2 nd group with application of developed monolateral wire- and half-pin device (23 cases). Material and Methods. The observation of 87 patients with fractures of the femoral neck. Operations performed using spokes kit for transosseous osteosynthesis by GA llizarov and develop devices for the treatment of patients with fractures of the proximal femur. Two groups of patients were studied: duration of surgery, duration of osteosynthesis, complications, and outcomes (in terms of one year after the dismantling clips) using the modified scale Luboshyce — Mattis — Schwartzberg. Results. Fracture repair was achieved in 40 patients (62, 5 %) of the 1 st group. The following complications were observed in this group: non-union and pseudarthrosis — in 21 (32, 8 %) case; aseptic necrosis of the femoral head in 3 (4, 7 %) cases; hip ankyloses — in one (1, 6 %) case, breakage and migration of wires into the joint cavity and smaller pelvis — 3 (4, 7 %) patients and cutting out of wires from the femoral head was observed in 3 (4, 7 %) cases. Totally 61 complication were revealed. In the second group of the patients non-union was found in one patient (64 years old). Complications were observed in 6 patients of this group — pint-tract infection, moderate secondary displacement of the fragments (the patient fell down on the operated limb) and wire breakage. Conclusion. The efficiency of the femoral neck osteosynthesis with application of elaborated monolateral wire- and half-pin fixator made up 95, 7 % of the positive outcomes (in osteosynthesis using <b>bunch</b> of <b>wires</b> with llizarov frame fixation the same 60, 9 % of the positive outcomes) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{method that}} {{measures}} the transverse profile (emittance) {{of the bunch}} by detecting radiation arising at the scattering of the <b>bunch</b> on scanning <b>wire</b> is widely used. In this work information about bunch scattering is obtained by measuring the oscillation frequency of the tightened scanning wire. In such a way, the system of radiation (or secondary particles) extraction and measurement can be removed. The entire unit consists of a compact fork with tightened wire and a scanning system. Normal oscillation frequency of a wire depends on wire tension, its geometric parameters, and, in a second approximation, its elastic characteristics. Normal oscillations are generated by interaction of an alternating current through the wire with magnetic field of a permanent magnet. In this case, {{it is suggested that}} the magnetic field of the accelerator (field of dipole magnets or quadrupole magnets) be used for excitation of oscillations. The dependence of oscillation frequency on beam scattering is determined by several factors, including changes of wire tension caused by transverse force of the beam and influence of beam self-field. Preliminary calculations show that the influence of wire heating will dominate. We have studied strain gauges on the basis of vibrating wire from various materials (tungsten, beryl bronze, and niobium zirconium alloys). A scheme of normal oscillation generation by alternating current in autogeneration circuit with automatic frequency adjustment was selected. A special method of wire fixation and elimination of transverse degrees of freedom allows us to achieve relative stability better than 10 ^{- 5 } during several days at a relative resolution of 10 ^{- 6 }. Experimental results and estimates of wire heating of existing scanners show that the wire heats up to a few hundred grades, which is enough for measurements. The usage of wire of micrometer thickness diminishes the problem of wire thermalization speed during the scanning of the bunch...|$|R
