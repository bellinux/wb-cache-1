Furter, and Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) as Rocky. While Sam is proud of his physique and secure in his own body-image, Finn feels self-conscious {{at the prospect of}} appearing in his underwear, as the role necessitates.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} {{a wide range of}} {{attachment}} difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. A disorder in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment <b>behaviors</b> <b>as</b> such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{standardized}} diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these <b>behaviors</b> <b>as</b> comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, Wilson {{developed}} a general model that brought together {{different areas of}} research in the study of information behavior. The model represented research topics as a series of nested fields, with information <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> the general area of investigation, information-seeking <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> its sub-set, and information searching <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> a further sub-set.|$|R

5000|$|B.F. Skinner {{was one of}} {{the first}} psychologists to take the role of {{imitation}} in verbal <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> a serious mechanism for acquisition. He identified echoic <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> one of his basic verbal operants, postulating that verbal behavior was learned by an infant from a verbal community. Skinner's account takes verbal behavior beyond an intra-individual process to an inter-individual process. He defined verbal <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> [...] "behavior reinforced through the mediation of others". Noam Chomsky refuted Skinner’s assumptions.|$|R

25|$|A {{focus on}} the nature of the {{creative}} person considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of ideation, autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on. A focus on place considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and <b>behaviors</b> <b>as</b> well as flexibility.|$|E

5000|$|Goode takes a constructionist {{approach}} to deviance. In his view, a behavior is deviant if {{and only if}} society at large considers it so. The broader social factors that go into the classification of a <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> deviant are thus considered a valid subject of study. His research focuses on the deviant individuals (and <b>behaviors)</b> themselves, <b>as</b> well as the particular individuals and groups that play a part in classifying the <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> deviant.|$|R
25|$|Hostile {{attribution}} bias, or hostile {{attribution of}} intent, is {{the tendency to}} interpret others' <b>behaviors</b> <b>as</b> having hostile intent, even when the behavior is ambiguous or benign. For example, a person {{with high levels of}} hostile attribution bias might see two people laughing and immediately interpret this behavior as two people laughing about him/her, even though the behavior was ambiguous and may have been benign.|$|E
25|$|Functional {{assessment}} of behavior provides hypotheses about {{the relationships between}} specific environmental events and behaviors. Decades of research have established that both desirable and undesirable behaviors are learned and maintained through interactions with the social and physical environment. Functional behavior assessments are used to identify controlling variables for challenging <b>behaviors</b> <b>as</b> the basis for intervention efforts designed to decrease the occurrence of these behaviors.|$|E
25|$|Low {{conscientiousness}} {{has been}} linked to antisocial and criminal <b>behaviors,</b> <b>as</b> well as unemployment, homelessness, and imprisonment. Low conscientiousness and low agreeableness taken together are also associated with substance abuse. People low in conscientiousness have difficulty saving money and have different borrowing practices than conscientious people. High conscientiousness is associated with more careful planning of shopping trips and less impulse buying of unneeded items. Conscientiousness {{has been found to be}} positively correlated with business white collar crime.|$|E

They swim through the pools during high tides and memorize how each pool connects to the others. Then, during low tides, they can exhibit accurate jumping <b>behaviors,</b> <b>as</b> they have memorized the paths. In a new environment, these gobies do not show jumping behaviors or jump into wrong pools. Nevertheless, after one night, they show the same accurate jumping behaviors.|$|E
25|$|Frequently, victims may not {{recognize}} {{what happened to}} them was rape. Some may remain in denial for years afterwards. Confusion over whether or not their experience constitutes rape is typical, especially for victims of psychologically coerced rape. Women may not identify their victimization as rape for many reasons such as feelings of shame, embarrassment, non-uniform legal definitions, reluctance to define the friend/partner as a rapist, or because they have internalized victim-blaming attitudes. The public perceives these <b>behaviors</b> <b>as</b> 'counterintuitive' and therefore, as evidence of a dishonest woman.|$|E
25|$|The term {{intimate}} partner {{violence is}} often used synonymously with domestic abuse or domestic violence, but it specifically refers to violence occurring within a couple relationship (i.e., marriage, cohabitation, or non-cohabitating intimate partners). To these, the World Health Organization (WHO) adds controlling <b>behaviors</b> <b>as</b> a form of abuse. Intimate partner violence has been observed in opposite and same-sex relationships, and in the former instance by both men against women and women against men. Family violence is a broader term, often used to include child abuse, elder abuse, and other violent acts between family members.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the hypothesis that}} interpersonal relationships of depressed persons would vary {{as a function of}} the personality variables sociotropy and autonomy. Depressed psychiatric patients who reported being in a current intimate relationship for at least six months were administered measures of sociotropy, autonomy, and several aspects of relationship functioning. Results indicated that sociotropy was related significantly to patients' reporting their own <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> demanding and their partners' <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> withdrawing, whereas autonomy was related to patients' reporting their partners' <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> demanding and their own <b>behavior</b> <b>as</b> withdrawing. Autonomy also was related to greater relationship dissatisfaction, and there was a trend for autonomy to be related to greater criticism of the partner. The results are consistent with a model in which sociotropy and autonomy increase vulnerability to depression, in part, through their effects on interpersonal relationship...|$|R

25|$|People with schizoid {{personality}} disorder rarely seek treatment for their condition. This is an issue found in many personality disorders, which prevents {{many people who are}} afflicted with these conditions, who tend to view their condition as not conflicting with their self-image and their abnormal perceptions and <b>behaviors</b> <b>as</b> rational and appropriate, from coming forward for treatment. There is little data on the effectiveness of various treatments on this personality disorder due to the infrequency of encountering this personality disorder in clinical settings.

25|$|Megachile rotundata {{is another}} species that pollinates the alfalfa plant. M. rotundata was unintentionally {{introduced}} into the United States during the 1940s, and its management as a pollinator of alfalfa {{has led to a}} three-fold increase in seed production in the U.S. The synchronous emergence of the adult bees of this species during alfalfa blooming period in combination with such <b>behaviors</b> <b>as</b> gregarious nesting, and utilization of leaves and nesting materials that have been mass-produced by humans provide positive benefits for the use of these bees in pollinating alfalfa.|$|E
25|$|Buddhism and {{the modern}} {{discipline}} of Psychology have multiple parallels and points of overlap. This includes a descriptive phenomenology of mental states, emotions and <b>behaviors,</b> <b>as</b> well as theories of perception and unconscious mental factors. Psychotherapists such as Erich Fromm have found in Buddhist enlightenment experiences (e.g. kensho) the potential for transformation, healing and finding existential meaning. Some contemporary mental-health practitioners such as Jon Kabat-Zinn increasingly find ancient Buddhist practices (such as the development of mindfulness) of empirically proven therapeutic value, while Buddhist teachers such as Jack Kornfield see Western Psychology as providing complementary practices for Buddhists.|$|E

Although procreation {{continues to be the}} primary explanation for {{sexual behavior}} in animals, recent observations on animal behavior has given alternative reasons for the engagement in sexual activities by animals. Animals have been observed to engage in sex for social interaction, demonstration of dominance, aggression relief, exchange for significant materials, and sexual stimulation. Observed non-procreative sexual activities include non-copulatory mounting (without penetration, or by the female), oral sex, genital stimulation, anal stimulation, interspecies mating, and acts of affection. There have also been observations of animals engaging in homosexual <b>behaviors,</b> <b>as</b> well as sex with dead animals and sex involving juveniles.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the combination of early-onset conduct disorder and ADHD may be associated with life-course-persistent antisocial <b>behaviors</b> <b>as</b> well as psychopathy. There is evidence that this combination is more aggressive and antisocial than those with conduct disorder alone. However, it is not a particularly distinct group since the vast majority of young children with conduct disorder also have ADHD. Some evidence indicates that this group has deficits in behavioral inhibition, similar to that of adults with psychopathy. They may not be more likely than those with conduct disorder alone to have the interpersonal/affective features and the deficits in emotional processing characteristic of adult psychopaths. Proponents of different types/dimensions of psychopathy have seen this type as possibly corresponding to adult secondary psychopathy and increased disinhibition in the triarchic model.|$|E
25|$|Critical to {{behavior}} analytic interventions {{is the concept}} of a systematic behavioral case formulation with a functional behavioral assessment or analysis at the core. This approach should apply a behavior analytic theory of change (see Behavioral change theories). This formulation should include a thorough functional assessment, a skills assessment, a sequential analysis (behavior chain analysis), an ecological assessment, a look at existing evidenced-based behavioral models for the problem behavior (such as Fordyce's model of chronic pain) and then a treatment plan based on how environmental factors influence behavior. Some argue that behavior analytic case formulation can be improved with an assessment of rules and rule-governed behavior. Some of the interventions that result from this type of conceptualization involve training specific communication skills to replace the problem <b>behaviors</b> <b>as</b> well as specific setting, antecedent, behavior, and consequence strategies.|$|E
