Historically, {{problems in}} archery have been solved {{primarily by the}} trial and error method. Of these problems, one deals with the increasing popular use of the <b>bow</b> <b>sight</b> as a sighting aid. The problem arises in setting the sight for various distances so that the desired amount of accuracy is achieved. This leads to three areas of difficulty. First, how does the novice archer set the sight setting when their ability {{does not allow for}} small enough arrow groups to determine group center. Second, as the shooting distance becomes longer, generally the arrow grouping grows in size thus expanding the group to a size too large in order to determine group center. Third, the archer does not have access to a shooting area of adequate dimensions or does not possess the time required to effectively use the trial and error method. The intent of this paper is two fold. First, to use aerodynamics and arrow ballistics with elementary bow and arrow geometry to determine these sight settings; theoretically, thereby eliminating the need for trial and error. This method should only need a minor adjustment at the desired distances to be effective. Second, to learn the Mathcad computer program...|$|E
50|$|Stabilizers aid in aiming by {{improving}} {{the balance of}} the <b>bow.</b> <b>Sights,</b> quivers, rests, and riser design make one side of the bow heavier. One purpose of stabilizers are to offset these forces. A reflex riser design will cause the top limb to lean towards the shooter. In this case a heavier front stabilizer is desired to offset this action. A deflex riser design has the opposite effect and a lighter front stabilizer may be used.|$|R

50|$|Arrows, <b>bows</b> and <b>sights</b> are {{commonly}} {{of the more}} modern varieties. However, all effective variations, including crossbows and wooden bows launching wooden arrows with stone points, are used. Arrowheads are chosen to ensure lethality. Broadheads feature blades that jut out from the shaft {{at an angle to}} cause more damage to the target; some models have retractable blades that only deploy once they hit the target.|$|R
50|$|Many sportsman's {{clubs and}} similar establishments {{throughout}} the US {{and other countries}} offer archery education programs for those 20 and younger. These programs are {{commonly referred to as}} Junior Olympic Archery Development Programs, or simply JOAD. There are over 250 JOAD Clubs recognized by USA Archery.4-H is also offering archery as an activity for those under 18. Usually members are have to have certain requirements for the bows they shoot (ex. use a Genesis <b>Bow,</b> no <b>sights,</b> no release, etc.). Members of archery 4-H clubs and those who use archery as their project can compete in target archery and field archery competitions.|$|R
60|$|This {{time the}} train gained more headway, and evidently {{had passed the}} point where the Indians could find {{obstructions}} to place on the track. Neale saw through a port-hole that the Sioux were dropping back {{from the front of the}} train and were no longer circling. Their firing had become desultory. Medicine <b>Bow</b> was in <b>sight.</b> The engine gathered headway.|$|R
5000|$|In tournaments, {{compound}} archers usually equip their <b>bows</b> with a <b>sighting</b> system, {{consisting of}} a [...] "peep sight" [...] held within the bowstring {{that acts as a}} back sight, and a front sight attached to the bow handle. Some front sights are magnifying and/or adjustable for targets at different distances. Some sights have multiple [...] "pins" [...] set up for targets at different distances.|$|R
6000|$|On {{the fourth}} day a pirate ship appeared. Reader, I {{do not know if}} you have ever seen a pirate ship. The sight was one to appal the stoutest heart. The entire ship was painted black, a black flag hung at the masthead, the sails were black, and on the deck people dressed all in black walked up and down arm-in-arm. The words [...] "Pirate Ship" [...] were painted in white letters on the <b>bow.</b> At the <b>sight</b> of it our crew were visibly cowed. It was a {{spectacle}} that would have cowed a dog.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} morning, Ed awakes {{early and}} goes hunting with his <b>bow</b> and arrow. <b>Sighting</b> a deer, he shoots but misses because {{he loses his}} nerve at the last moment. Lewis is unimpressed and Ed gets annoyed at his survivalist mentality. After breaking camp, Ed and Bobby set out in one canoe slightly ahead of Lewis and Drew. After spending a night in the camp, Bobby has {{changed his mind about}} the trip and is frustrated by Lewis' leadership, so Ed takes him as a canoe partner to keep the two apart.|$|R
60|$|The French Consulate was not distant. The fleur-de-lis waved over a house {{similar to}} Mr. Thompson's, {{but they were}} {{admitted}} with greater ceremony, when Mr. Thompson at length conducted them. Servants and slaves, brown and black, clad in white with blue sashes, and white officials in blue liveries, were drawn {{up in the first}} court in two lines to receive them; and the Chevalier, taking it all to himself, paraded in front with the utmost grandeur, until, at the next archway, two gentlemen, resplendent in gold lace, came forward with low <b>bows.</b> At <b>sight</b> of the little fellow there were cries of joy. M. Dessault spread out his arms, clasped the child to his breast, and shed tears over him, so that the less emotional Englishmen thought at first that they must be kinsmen. However, Arthur came in for a like embrace as the boy's preserver; and if Captain Beresford had not stepped back and looked uncomprehending and rigid he might have come in for the same.|$|R
60|$|It {{was growing}} a little clearer and Frank, turning around, saw a tall black spire of canvas cutting against the sky. He made out a frothy {{whiteness}} beneath it where the swell broke on the vessel's <b>bows,</b> and the <b>sight</b> of her singularly stirred his imagination. She had appeared so suddenly, probably {{from behind the}} point, and she looked ghostly in the uncertain light. She ran in under her headsails and boom-foresail with her mainmast bare, rising higher and growing clearer all the while. By and by there was a splash, and a voice broke through the wailing of the trees.|$|R
6000|$|And {{just then}} there passes {{down on the}} other side of the street a high man in a long black coat and a beaver hat. All the people in <b>sight</b> <b>bowed,</b> and some crossed the street to shake hands with him; folks came out of stores and houses to holler at him; women leaned out of windows and smiled; and all the kids stopped playing to look at him. Our {{landlord}} stepped out on the porch and bent himself double like a carpenter's rule, and sung out, [...] "Good-morning, Colonel," [...] when he was a dozen yards gone by.|$|R

50|$|The {{choice of}} a {{mechanical}} release aid versus a finger tab must be accounted for in a compound <b>bow's</b> tuning and <b>sighting,</b> as well as {{choice of a}}rrow rest, as finger-released arrows will group in a different spot when using a mechanical release aid versus a finger tab. Likewise, the choice of arrow rest for a compound bow depends on whether a finger release archery tab or mechanical release aid is used. For a finger-released arrow, a plunger pin is most commonly used as the arrow rest, to impart a tuned impulse laterally to the arrow {{at the moment of}} release to improve point-of-impact groupings. In contrast, for a release aid configuration, a Whisker-biscuit arrow rest is very commonly used with a compound bow.|$|R
6000|$|The {{people of}} both sides had {{supposed}} that Dylks was sitting behind the pulpit, as his habit was, with {{his head out of}} <b>sight</b> <b>bowed</b> in meditation. But when Enraghty, after a few words, sat down to await the coming of the Spirit, suddenly the minister whose turn to preach would have come that night, sprang to his full height in the pulpit and denounced Enraghty's pretense. The believers rose shouting to their feet, and crying, [...] "He is my God!" [...] stormed out of the Temple in the night, where their voices were heard repeating, [...] "He is my God!" [...] till they swelled together in the hymn which was their confession of Dylks. A few of the unbelievers remained in the Temple, amazed, but the greater part followed the believers into the night.|$|R
60|$|Once, at {{the dusk}} of the evening, {{we saw a}} figure all in white, {{apparently}} of more than human stature, flourishing about the road, now throwing up its arms, now leaping to an astonishing height in the air, then turning round several times successively, then raising itself to its full height and gesticulating violently. Our troop, on the alert to discover and believe in the supernatural, made a halt at some distance from this shape; and, as it became darker, there was something appalling even to the incredulous, in the lonely spectre, whose gambols, if they hardly accorded with spiritual dignity, were beyond human powers. Now it leapt right up in the air, now sheer over a high hedge, and was again the moment after in the road before us. By the time I came up, the fright experienced by the spectators of this ghostly exhibition, began to manifest itself in the flight of some, and the close huddling together of the rest. Our goblin now perceived us; he approached, and, as we drew reverentially back, made a low <b>bow.</b> The <b>sight</b> was irresistibly ludicrous even to our hapless band, and his politeness was hailed by a shout of laughter;--then, again springing up, as a last effort, it sunk to the ground, and became almost invisible through the dusky night. This circumstance again spread silence and fear through the troop; the more courageous at length advanced, and, raising the dying wretch, discovered the tragic explanation of this wild scene. It was an opera-dancer, and {{had been one of}} the troop which deserted from Villeneuve-la-Guiard: falling sick, he had been deserted by his companions; in an access of delirium he had fancied himself on the stage, and, poor fellow, his dying sense eagerly accepted the last human applause that could ever be bestowed on his grace and agility.|$|R
