This process {{is frequently}} done with baking soda (sodium <b>bicarbonate),</b> <b>water,</b> and a spoon. Once mixed and heated, the bicarbonate reacts with the hydrochloride of the powder cocaine, forming free base cocaine and carbonic acid (H2CO3) in a reversible acid-base reaction. The heating accelerates the degradation of carbonic acid into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water. Loss of CO2 prevents the reaction from reversing back to cocaine hydrochloride. Free base cocaine separates as an oily layer, floating on the top of the now leftover aqueous phase. It is at this point that the oil is picked up rapidly, usually with a pin or long thin object. This pulls the oil up and spins it, allowing air to set and dry the oil, and allows the maker to roll the oil into the rock-like shape.|$|E

The seasonal ice formations, which either formed by the: (1) freezing of dripping water (ice stalagmite and stalactite); (2) freezing of stagnant or slow moving water (floor ice and curtain ice) and; (3) condensation of water vapor (hoar ice), all (except floor ice) showed kinetic isotope effects associated with the rapid freezing of calcium – <b>bicarbonate</b> <b>water.</b> This was made evident in the dD, d 18 O and d (deuterium excess) compositions of the formed ice where they plot along a kinetic freezing line. The cryogenic calcite powders, which are found {{on the surface of}} the seasonal ice formations, also show kinetic isotope effects. Their d 13 C and d 18 O values are among the highest measured in cold-climate carbonates and are caused by the rapid rate of freezing, which results in strong C-O disequilibrium between the water, dissolved C species in the water, and precipitating calcite. Although the cryogenic calcite precipitated as powders, diverse crystal habits were observed under scanning electron microscope, which included rhombs, aggregated rhombs, spheres, needles, and aggregated structures. The rhomb crystal habits were observed in samples stored and observed at room temperature, whereas the sphere and needle structures were observed in the samples kept and observed under cryogenic conditions. Considering that the formation of cryogenic calcite is purely abiotic (freezing of calcium – <b>bicarbonate</b> <b>water),</b> the presence of spherical structures, commonly associated with biotic processes, might represent vaterite, a polymorph of calcite stable only at low temperatures. It is therefore suggested that care should be taken before suggesting biological origin to calcite precipitates based solely on crystal habits because they might represent pseudo-biogenic structures formed through abiotic processes...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study {{concerns}} the Souss upstream basin. The {{objective is to}} investigate the characteristics of surface water and groundwater, {{to assess the impact}} of artificial recharge as reinforcement of the natural replenishment and assess the renewal of groundwater under semi-arid area. Two major water types are observed: (i) surface waters and upstream springs (least mineralized) and (ii) all groundwater samples (prevailing calcium and magnesium <b>bicarbonate</b> <b>water</b> type). Water isotopes show a low evaporation of precipitations during infiltration. Impoverishment in heavy isotopes is the characteristic of mountain rainfalls, or of a climate colder and wetter than present. Carbon- 14 activities (34 - 94 pmc) indicate a long residence time. The artificial recharge is low compared to the reservoir volume, due to which the renewal rate is also low. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a study that was conducted to determine the relationship between hydrogeochemical composition and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope ratios of the Mt. Vulture spring waters. Forty samples of spring waters were collected from local outcrops of Quaternary volcanites. Physico-chemical parameters were measured in the field and analyses completed for major and minor elements and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic ratios. A range of water types was distinguished varying from alkaline-earth <b>bicarbonate</b> <b>waters,</b> reflecting less intense water-rock interaction processes to alkali <b>bicarbonate</b> <b>waters,</b> probably representing interaction with volcanic rocks of Mt. Vulture and marine evaporites. The average 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope ratios suggest at least 3 different sources. However, some samples have average Sr isotope ratios (0. 70704 - 0. 70778) well above those of the volcanites. These ratios imply interaction with other rocks having higher 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios, probably Triassic evaporites, which is substantiated by their higher content of Na, SO 4 and Cl. The Sr isotope ratios for some samples (e. g. Toka and Traficante) are intermediate between the value for the Vulture volcanites and that for the local Mesozoic rocks. The salt content of these samples also lies between the value for waters interacting solely with the volcanites and the value measured in the more saline samples. These waters are thus assumed to result from the mixing of waters circulating in volcanic rocks with waters presumably interacting with the sedimentary bedrock (marine evaporites). © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Aim. The present {{investigation}} was undertaken to study if the different fluid replacement (normal vs calcium <b>bicarbonate</b> rich <b>water)</b> could influence heavy cycling performance and explosive power. The {{purpose of the}} present study is to compare the effect of water replacement during sauna bath using 2 different types of water intake: Normal vs calcium rich bicarbonate and very low sodium concentration (Sangemini, Italy) on muscle mechanical behaviour. Methods. A group of 27 healthy and moderately active students, 19 males and 8 females, randomly assigned in 2 groups have performed the same test protocol in 2 sessions. After 5 minutes of warming up on an electro-magnetically-braked cycle ergometer at 50 W for males and 35 W for females, and free revolutions per minute, and 3 minutes of static stretching the subjects performed a counter movement jump (CMJ) and after a modified Wingate test on the cycle ergometer for 60 s. The Wingate test started from 0 rpm and the torque was set at 0. 7 Nm/kg body weight for the males and 0. 67 Nm/kg body weight for the females. Mechanical power, synchronised with electromyography (EMG) analysis from the mm Vastus lateralis and medialis and Lactate (mM/L) were measured. In the 2 nd session the subjects took first a Finnish sauna bath at 900 and 100 % humidity. After sauna the subjects drunk water from a bottle ad libitum, and 1 hour after the sauna performed the 2 nd test with the same protocol than in the 1 st session. The Group A (Control group) took a normal water while the Group B (Experimental group) took a calcium <b>bicarbonate</b> rich <b>water.</b> Results. In the jumping performance the group treated with calcium <b>water</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> showed a significantly increase of height of the centre of gravity (31, 6 +/- 7, 12 cm vs 32, 3 +/- 7, 42 cm p< 0, 05) while the control group (33, 6 +/- 6, 5 cm vs 32, 0 +/- 5, 6 cm, p=n. s.) was negatively affected by normal water after the sauna bath. Average power, average power/body mass ratio, and EMGrms, no statistically significant differences were founded in both groups. The group treated with calcium <b>water</b> <b>bicarbonate</b> showed a decrease of lactate production post treatment test (12, 3 +/- 1, 9 mM/L vs 10, 6 +/- 2, 1 mM/L, p< 0, 05) while no difference was noted in the control group (11, 9 +/- 1, 8 mM/L vs 11, 4 +/- 2, 0 mM/L, p=n. s.). Also significant differences was found in the maximal lactate and the average power ratio. Conclusions. It seems that the supplement of calcium <b>bicarbonate</b> rich <b>water</b> could effect positively the negative effect of elevated (H+) on Ca 2 + binding mechanism. This is a simple suggestions which, however cannot explain why the experimental subjects drinking calcium <b>bicarbonate</b> rich <b>water</b> developed lower blood [Lac-].

Over this period biomarkers of bone turnover (serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D, osteocalcin, urinary telopeptides and hydroxyproline), serum lipids (total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides), venous and urinary pH were measured together with measurements of standard biochemistry, haematology and urine examinations. Serum magnesium concentrations and urinary pH in subjects consuming the magnesium <b>bicarbonate</b> supplemented <b>water</b> increased significantly at Day 84 compared to subjects consuming the spring water control (magnesium - p = 0. 03; pH - p = 0. 018). The consumption of spring water led to a trend for an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations while the PTH concentrations remained stable with the intake of the supplemented spring water. However there were no significant effects of magnesium bicarbonate supplementation in changes to biomarkers of bone mineral metabolism (n-telopeptides, hydroxyproline, osteocalcin and 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D) or serum lipids or blood pressure in postmenopausal women from Day 0 to Day 84. Conclusions Short term regular ingestion of magnesium <b>bicarbonate</b> supplemented <b>water</b> provides a source of orally available magnesium. Long term clinical studies are required to investigate any health benefits. Trial registration ACTRN 12609000863235 </p...|$|R
30|$|The excess sum of {{carbonate}} and bicarbonate in groundwater {{over the}} sum of calcium and magnesium also influences the quality of water. High carbonate and <b>bicarbonate</b> in <b>water</b> essentially increase the sodium hazard of the water to a level greater than that indicated by the SAR. High carbonate and bicarbonate tend to precipitate calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate when the soil solution is concentrated during soil drying.|$|R
