30|$|While {{the detail}} {{discussion}} of the design outcome {{is beyond the scope}} of this present paper, the leanings from the studio exercise create an entry point to the complex socio-spatial dynamics of the present day villages in Bangladesh. The following sections of the paper present an interpretive analysis on the critical leanings from the studio projects based on the feedback from the villagers on the proposed designs. Given that the strategy of densification is a <b>borrowed</b> <b>concept</b> from the developed context and acknowledging that villages and non-urban areas have long been neglected areas in urban studies in developing contexts, the paper discusses relevant literature from developed context to draw on the incommensurability of the rural settlements dynamics between the villages in developed contexts and those of Bangladesh. Finally, the prospects of rural settlements dynamics are discussed.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{intends to}} develop the ethical implications {{of the concept of}} personality through the phenomenological approaches of Scheler and Waldenfels. For both philosophers, an ethics based on a moral formalism would be very pernicious to the concept of personality and even for ethics itself. For ethics, it would bring a kind of arbitrariness and for the person a sort of depersonalization. In order to advance a concept of ethics grounded on the values of a person, Scheler introduces the idea of God’s love for us as intuitively given athwart the values of holiness itself. From this given intuition, Scheler will build up the idea of good in itself as a model, so that a person could form a good personality through an accurate rank of values. Waldenfels would say that even the personality grounded on such mystical experiences would have the consequence of a depersonalization of the person in his relation with the other, the world, and with himself. Waldenfels will find, through a genealogy of the constitution of order thresholds zones that will prevent a <b>borrowed</b> <b>concept</b> of personality only from an inside, or an outside. As an open process of what happen with us, the personality cannot be static, but latent as it is done responsively...|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} based on the empirical result of a Minor Field Study that was conducted in the small village of Paje, East coast Zanzibar, Tanzania during April-May 2012. The object of the research is Seaweed Center, a foreign initiated social responsible business, and the group of local seaweed farming women that are part owners and working for the company. With qualitative methods such as interviews and participatory observations this study sought to find out how a social responsible business with the aim to create development can be perceived legitimate in a development context. Taking off in the employees point of view we discuss the perspective and expectations of social responsible business and development and analyze it in relation to how legitimacy can be understood using the theoretical tools from organizational theory. To further understand the social responsible business’s legitimacy in its wider development context we are also relating our empirical data to, from the development discourse <b>borrowed</b> <b>concept</b> of local ownership. Applying these two corresponding but still different perspectives on the employees view and expectations of social responsible business, we have found that the legitimacy is high, even though the employees’ do not relate to the concept of social responsible business. Moreover, that the employees do not perceive themselves as part of the business development objective but instead as being the development actors, which we argue indicates that the local ownership is high. With this paper we hope to contribute to a wider understanding of what makes it possible and legitimate for an initiative coming from outside to operate in a complex development context...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I {{will analyze}} how Liang Qichao’s idea of nation {{played a role}} in the {{emergence}} of national identity in China in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The concept of nation in China didn’t emerge from the bottom-up spontaneously. Rather, I will argue, the emergence of Chinese national identity can largely be explained as an imported ideology pursued by Chinese elites. In the formation of the concept of nation in China, not only the contact with the West but also interactions and tensions among the East Asian countries were crucial. This thesis is divided into two interdependent parts. The first part deals with theoretical studies of nationalism and national identity, and it will provide a general picture of the major theoretical trend in nationalism. This part will explore three major perspectives: the primordialist perspective that describes ethnic identities as something fixed and unchanging; the ethno-symbolist perspective that argues that pre-modern ethnic ties are important in understanding the formation of modern nations and nationalism; and the modernist perspective that treats nationalism as a recent phenomenon. Through a critical evaluation of theories of nationalism and national identity, I will begin to discern the contours of how Liang Qichao’s concept of nation was formed. In the second part, by way of introducing nationalist discourses in China, I will explore historical concepts of nation and its boundaries. Since his arrival in Japan, Liang immersed himself in Western political theory and read Japanese authors broadly, and his thoughts changed accordingly. As a result, Liang advocated great nationalism that would awaken a sense of belonging to China in all the peoples of the Qing Empire. In this regard, the introduction of Liang’s <b>borrowed</b> <b>concept</b> of nation to China was a transformative event for Chinese national self-perception. ...|$|E
