40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design of an {{integrated}} starter generator system for a car flywheel based on the Switched Reluctance Machine (SRM) technology. First, we discuss about the starter generator problematic following {{the results of our}} bibliography research. Secondly, we briefly remained generalities about the SRM and the determination of the laws control. In addition, we designed the converter associated to the machine using (Matlab/Simulink) software in order to identify the laws control and to adapt the operating modes (motor, generator, <b>booster,</b> <b>brake).</b> Finally, simulations of the open and closed loop model were performed on the converter with the (SRM...|$|E

5000|$|A <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> is an {{enhanced}} master cylinder setup {{used to reduce}} the amount of pedal pressure needed for braking. It employs a booster set up to act with the master cylinder to give higher hydraulic pressure to the brakes and/or lower force applied on the brake pedal through a <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> push-rod. The <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> usually uses vacuum from the engine intake to boost the force applied by the pedal on to the master cylinder, or may employ an extra vacuum pump to enable it. Without the engine running the brake pedal feels very hard and ineffective on the braking capability. An [...] "active" [...] booster is a non [...] "conventional" [...] booster where a solenoid is used to open the booster air valve to automatically push the master cylinder forward to perform some forms of dynamic stability control. <b>Brake</b> <b>boosters</b> come in either a single diaphragm or tandem diaphragm (which is generally used for bigger vehicles and trucks). They can be [...] "cabin-breathers" [...] (taking clean filtered air from inside the cabin thus may be more noisy) or [...] "engine-breathers" [...] (less noisy but more at risk for becoming clogged with mud/ice if not protected properly).|$|R

50|$|A <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> {{is used on}} {{virtually}} all vehicles which use hydraulic brakes for their primary braking circuit. Vacuum servos are not used on vehicles which use cables, rods (or other mechanical linkages), or pressurized air systems for their primary brake circuits.|$|R
5000|$|Emergency Braking System : The EBS slowed KITT {{down from}} Super-Pursuit speeds. It {{consisted}} of a forward <b>braking</b> <b>booster</b> and air panels that popped out to create air friction (air brakes). First used in Episode 70, [...] "Knight of the Juggernaut, Part II".|$|R
50|$|The {{vacuum booster}} {{was invented in}} 1927 {{in order to provide}} a shorter {{stopping}} distance. Vacuum <b>boosters</b> provide <b>brake</b> assist for the driver by multiplying the force out of the booster creating more than the force that was used to push on the <b>brake</b> pedal. The <b>booster</b> works by pulling the air out of the booster chamber with a pump creating a low pressure system inside. When the driver steps on the brake pedal, the input rod on the booster is pushed in which lets atmospheric pressure into the booster. This, in turn, pushes the diaphragm toward the master cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|In late 1983, the [...] "84" [...] Giulietta (Series 3) was presented, {{with minor}} {{differences}} in appearance, bumpers were redesigned and the dashboard was significantly re-designed, the instruments changed slightly and {{the rear seat}} in some versions changed its form. Mechanically it was basically the same, with minor modifications to the <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> and inlet manifold on some versions.|$|R
25|$|ESC uses a {{hydraulic}} modulator {{to assure that}} each wheel receives the correct brake force. A similar modulator is used in ABS. ABS needs to reduce pressure during braking, only. ESC additionally needs to increase pressure in certain situations and an active vacuum <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> unit may be utilized {{in addition to the}} hydraulic pump to meet these demanding pressure gradients.|$|R

50|$|The Spec-R {{differed}} from previous Silvia models by featuring a 6-speed manual gearbox {{as well as}} a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Spec-R also included extensive chassis and suspension strengthening via the use of larger anti-roll bars and strut bracing. The S15 featured the same 4-piston front brake calipers that were found in the Z32 300ZX but included a larger <b>brake</b> <b>booster.</b>|$|R
50|$|An S-cam {{is part of}} a {{braking system}} used in heavy {{vehicles}} such as trucks and wheeled machinery. It consists of a shaft, usually around 4 to 25 inches long, turned at one end by means of an air-powered <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> and lever with an 'S' shaped cam at the wheel end. Turning the shaft pushes the brake shoes against the drum, producing friction.|$|R

25|$|The {{braking system}} {{includes}} four-channel ABS, electronic brake distribution, and a creep aid system {{to prevent the}} car from rolling on a hill. A <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> pressure monitoring system monitors vacuum when the engine is shut off during Idle Stop mode. Traction control and vehicle stability assist are also included. The front brakes are single-piston sliding caliper with a one-piece ventilated rotor. Drum brakes {{are used in the}} rear.|$|R
50|$|The Spec-S {{featured}} a 5-speed manual transmission (in {{addition to a}} 4-speed automatic available on both the Spec-S and the Spec-R). It lacked the additional chassis support of the Spec-R; featured 4-piston front brake caliper and a slightly smaller <b>brake</b> <b>booster.</b> The Spec-S came only with an open differential. Australian-delivered Spec-S models featured the same helical differential, chassis bracing and 6 speed manual transmission as the Australian market Spec-R models.|$|R
5000|$|In 1971 {{the factory}} {{version of this}} package was introduced, simply called the 55 Marathon. This did not feature an {{upgraded}} suspension, and had a [...] 1108 cc engine, the BR110. This raised the top speed to 145 km/h. The 55 Marathon featured wider steel wheels, exterior striping and a <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> was added for safety and comfort. The Marathon was available as a saloon or a coupe.|$|R
50|$|Because of low vacuum at high RPM, {{reports of}} {{unintended}} acceleration are {{often accompanied by}} complaints of failed or weakened brakes, as the high-revving engine, having an open throttle, is unable to provide enough vacuum to power the <b>brake</b> <b>booster.</b> This problem is exacerbated in vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions as the vehicle will automatically downshift upon application of the brakes, thereby increasing the torque delivered to the driven-wheels {{in contact with the}} road surface.|$|R
50|$|The car sold well in {{both the}} USSR and other Eastern Bloc {{countries}} and was sold for export. In the USSR, the M-408/412 was the second best selling Moskvitch for the whole 1970s decade, bested only by its successor, the 2140. In {{order to make it}} more competitive, the car was often upgraded during the time of its production and equipped with better gearboxes, more powerful 75 h.p. motors, hydrovacuum <b>brake</b> <b>boosters,</b> etc.|$|R

50|$|In May 1999, the AU range {{received}} a minor update, introducing a bigger <b>brake</b> <b>booster,</b> front power windows for the Forté and XR6 and lowering the rear suspension of non-XR variants by 24 mm. To heighten its interior quality, the Forté was offered with 'medium graphite' interior trim (slightly darker than originally) and the patterned seat material was {{changed from the}} bolsters to the seat centres. Buyers were also able to order the darker 'warm charcoal' colour scheme of other Falcon variants.|$|R
50|$|Albert Dewandre (Liege, Belgium), an {{engineer}} and business owner, was the inventor of servo-brake or <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> system “Dewandre” in 1927. It is a brake boosting system that uses the depression caused by the suction in the intake manifold of an internal combustion engine to reduce {{the pressure on the}} brake pedal. The advantage of the Dewandre system is twofold: a softer push on the brake pedal, but also a notably shorter braking distance. His invention was manufactured and sold through the Robert Bosch company.|$|R

2500|$|... 1978 models had minor {{front and}} rear styling revisions. The engine line-up {{remained}} unchanged, but numerically lower axle ratios were used {{in an attempt to}} boost fuel economy. The 305 and 350 engines went from a standard 2.56:1 axle in 1977 (2.73:1 for wagons), to a 2.41:1 axle in 1978 (2.56:1 for wagons). An optional 3.08 axle was also available for 350 powered Caprices. The 305 V8 engine received an aluminum intake manifold which reduced engine weight by 35pounds. A larger <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> was also added to help reduce braking effort. New options included a steel sliding moonroof and 40-channel CB radio built into the AM/FM radio.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Because of the Limitations and {{shortcomings}} of the traditional multi-disciplinary optimization methods, this paper presents a useful optimal method named Analytical Target Cascading (ATC) for braking system characteristics optimization.
