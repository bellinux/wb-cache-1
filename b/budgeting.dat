40|$|Country-specific factors {{prevent a}} strong linear {{relationship}} between the legislature''s budgetary powers {{and the extent of}} its separation from the executive. Electoral and voting systems, bicameralism, constitutional and legal constraints, voluntary contracts of political parties, and long-standing traditions all influence the relative budgetary powers of executives and legislatures. Differences in the legislature''s budgetary authority in twenty-eight countries with five different forms of government are examined. It is concluded that differences in budgetary powers within a particular form of government are as great as those between different forms of government.

While fiscal forecasting in Canada {{is governed by}} one of the strongest institutional frameworks, quantitative analysis suggests that <b>budget</b> projections of macroeconomic and fiscal aggregates have been more cautious than in other countries since the mid- 1990 s.

Albrecht allegedly preferred a definite demise of Brother Justin to a cliffhanger, but show creator Daniel Knauf stated Albrecht might have been misquoted. According to Knauf, Albrecht had wished in preproduction discussions to conclude season 2 with a fight between Brother Justin and Ben, which had always been Knauf's intention. HBO had then approved the open ending by greenlighting the final scene in the writing phase, <b>budgeting</b> the filming including the final shot, and owning the rights of the final cut of all episodes. There was never a plan to cancel Carnivàle prematurely, and HBO had only decided the cancellation shortly before their announcement.
