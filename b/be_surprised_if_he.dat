Because of her relationship with Reynardine and the events with Coyote and Ysengrin, Antimony is nominated to begin training to become a medium, one of the individuals who moderate disputes between the Wood and the Court and communicates with etheric beings, and she decides to return to the woods to speak with Coyote. When Antimony visits Coyote, she learns that in the past Coyote had travelled across the sea to find Renard (called later Reynardine) and Ysengrin and make them into [...] "powerful being" [...] like himself.Antimony: [...] "Why were you looking for Renard in the first place? [...] Why bring him here?"Coyote: [...] "I sought to make him into a powerful being such as myself!" [...] He had given Ysengrin [...] "power over the trees" [...] and given Reynardine the power to take bodies, but bodies that Reynardine took always died after he left themCoyote: [...] "For some reason, when Renard had the ability , any body he took that was not his own would die when it was used up."

Reynardine had been in love with Antimony's mother, Surma,Coyote: [...] "I wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> cared very deeply about you, ! You see, Renard fell desperately in love with Surma!" [...] and had used his power to steal a young man's body and woo Surma; the man died, however, and Reynardine was imprisoned in Gunnerkrigg Court until the events surrounding his first meeting with Antimony.Coyote: [...] " [...] soon runs away! He steals the body of a young man and disappears into the Court, looking to woo the fiery Surma. [...] We heard he was captured, tricked! ... and I did not see him again until last summer." ...|$|E

I breathed {{on the back of}} his stooping neck--and--I've heard he never could be warm at any fire afterwards. I should have <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could! Then I whipped up the babe, and came flying home here like a bat to his belfry.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I {{could not}} have {{believed}} it of him!' said she; 'but ask for a dress of sunshine, and I shall <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> indeed <b>if</b> <b>he</b> manages that!' ...|$|R

I saw the telegram and {{made up my mind}} I'd get the start of the O'Gormans. Dad won't run away. I've warned him they are on his trail and he didn't make any reply. But I wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> gone, this very day, to cover up his traces. He's bright enough to know that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> destroys all evidence they can't prove anything against him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “My dear, he’s {{done all}} {{that is to be}} done in that {{direction}} already. He’s got rid of his wrist-watch and his hunting flask and both his cigarette cases, and I shouldn’t <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> <b>he’s</b> wearing imitation-gold sleeve links instead of those his Aunt Rhoda gave him on his seventeenth birthday. He can’t sell his clothes, of course, except his winter overcoat, and I’ve locked that up in the camphor cupboard on the pretext of preserving it from moth. I really don’t see what else he can raise money on. I consider that I’ve been both firm and farseeing.” ...|$|R

Throughout the two boys were careless and painfully irreverent, and the governess, annoyed and ashamed, hurried on as fast as she could, in order {{to put an end to}} the unpleasant scene. When it was over she greatly admired the correctness of Gerald's answers, seeming to think it extraordinary that he should not have made a single mistake; whereas Marian would have <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had.
