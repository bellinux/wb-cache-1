5|$|As Hurricane Felix was looping {{offshore}} {{the eastern}} United States, it produced swells of 26ft (8m) along the Nova Scotia coast on an otherwise sunny day. Beaches were closed. <b>Buoys</b> near the Newfoundland coast recorded wave heights of 49ft (15m), while <b>buoys</b> farther offshore reported wave heights of 82ft (27.5m). The outer rainbands {{of the storm}} dropped light rainfall, peaking at around 3.43mm (87mm) in northern Newfoundland. Offshore Caithness in Scotland, waves from the remnants of Felix submerged an experimental wave power station, damaging it further after previous waves damaged the system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Buoy</b> {{is widely}} applied in oceanographic research, ocean {{engineering}} and so on. The high cable tension and location derivation of its anchor can greatly affected the working condition of <b>buoy.</b> Multi-body software ADAMS {{is used to}} analyze the dynamics of deployment for <b>buoy.</b> Firstly, model of mooring <b>buoy</b> is developed. The forces on components of <b>buoy</b> are given such as drag forces, inertia force and impact force between bottom and anchor. The program is developed by macro commands in ADAMS environment. The trajectory and tension force of different nodes on <b>buoy</b> are calculated. This method can simulate the dynamics of deployment process for <b>buoy</b> system. And it is also helpful for guidance for <b>buoy</b> design and deployment process planning...|$|R
40|$|A {{wave energy}} {{converter}} (WEC) of point absorber type is tested at {{the west coast of}} Sweden. The <b>buoy</b> is a vertical cylin-der. The linear generator on the seabed has limited stroke length. Large waves cause the generator to reach its maximum stroke length. As this happen, a spring in the generator is compressed, causing the <b>buoy</b> to instantly come to rest. During this process the force between the <b>buoy</b> and the generator is measured. Also the acceleration of the <b>buoy</b> is measured. This process and the extreme forces on the generator hull is described and the study shows that the magnitude of this force is greatly influenced by the added mass of the <b>buoy</b> and thus the <b>buoy</b> geometry. The ratio between the extreme forces on the hull and the forces during nor-mal operation will affect the dimensioning and economy of the WEC. Force acting between generator and <b>buoy</b> were measured during various events as the WEC was operating. Heave added mass was derived from the measurements and found to be greater than the theoretical value.

5|$|While racing opponents, {{the player}} must {{successfully}} manoeuvre the Jet Ski around various <b>buoys.</b> There {{are two types}} of buoys: red colored, which must be passed on the right side, and yellow <b>buoys,</b> which must be passed on the left side. Each time a buoy is correctly passed, a power arrow in the game's HUD will light, allowing the player's Jet Ski to gain speed. Up to five power arrows can be lit in order to obtain maximum power. Therefore, maintaining this process will allow the player to maintain a high speed. Failure to correctly pass a single buoy will result in the loss of all the player's accumulated power (though the power arrows can be lit again one by one) and missing five <b>buoys</b> {{over the course of a}} race will result in disqualification. Leaving the course area limited by pink <b>buoys</b> for more than five seconds will also result in disqualification.|$|E

In this paper, <b>buoy</b> system with surface <b>buoy,</b> cable segments with components, anchor and so on is modeled by applying multibody dynamics method. Then numerical method is used to solve the ordinary differential equations and dynamics simulations are achieved while anchor is casting from board.
