500|$|After redshirting his {{freshman}} year in 1980–81 {{because he could not}} yet get clearance from the NCAA to play, Olajuwon played sparingly as a redshirt freshman in 1981–82, and the Cougars were eliminated in the Final Four by the eventual NCAA champion, North Carolina Tar Heels. Olajuwon sought advice from the coaching staff about how to increase his playing time, and they advised him to work out with local Houston resident and multiple NBA MVP winner, Moses Malone. Malone, who was then a center on the NBA's Houston Rockets, played games every off season with several NBA players at the Fonde Recreation Center. Olajuwon joined the workouts and went head to head with Malone in several games throughout the summer. Olajuwon credited this experience with rapidly improving his game: [...] "The way Moses helped me is by <b>being</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> playing and allowing me to go against that level of competition. He was the best center in the NBA at the time, so I was trying to improve my game against the best." ...|$|E

Porterfield said [...] "I've learnt a lot from Trent– he brought young players through, looked after them and he set an example by how he went about his game and how he prepared on and off the field. I may be young but I've plenty of experience of captaincy and I love it, <b>being</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> right in the mixer. I was vice-captain under Trent and I filled in when he was off the field so I've had a taste of it".|$|E

And we theorized, too, but there was never a theory that would account for our driver's voice <b>being</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> nor yet account for his Indian murderers talking such good English, if they were Indians.|$|E
60|$|These stairs {{are a part}} of the bridge; they {{consist of}} three flights. Just below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the left terminates in an {{ornamental}} pilaster facing towards the Thames. At this point the lower steps widen: so that a person turning that angle of the wall, is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him, if only a step. The countryman looked hastily round, when he reached this point; and as there seemed no better place of concealment, and, the tide <b>being</b> <b>out,</b> <b>there</b> was plenty of room, he slipped aside, with his back to the pilaster, and there waited: pretty certain that they would come no lower, and that even if he could not hear what was said, he could follow them again, with safety.|$|E

On their way back, Carl spots a walker and attracts its attention to kill it, but when they see who it is Carl stops while Enid wants to kill it.

5000|$|In 2001, Vincent {{appeared}} in the feature film spoof Not Another Teen Movie as the foreign exchange student Areola, who appears throughout the entire film nude.

Vincent found the role challenging, never having appeared nude in a film, or even auditioned for a nude role. During the course of filming, however, she became {{more comfortable with the}} character. In a 2011 interview, Vincent commented on her experience performing nude for the first time: [...] It's weird, it's hard because your body is your body and it's personal. It's easier to shoot that scene because everyone was professional and my character was ridiculous—I did many different accents in the movie, and it was funny ... it was a comedy.
