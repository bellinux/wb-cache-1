40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computer-aided {{design of a}} <b>transformer</b> <b>station</b> grounding system. Fault conditions in a <b>transformer</b> <b>station</b> can produce huge damage to <b>transformer</b> <b>station</b> equipment if the grounding system is not designed properly. A well designed grounding system {{is a very important}} part of the project for <b>transformer</b> <b>station</b> design as a whole. This paper analyses a procedure for transformer grounding system design and spatial distribution of touch and step voltage on the ground surface level, using the CDEGS (Current Distribution Electromagnetic Interference Grounding and Soil Structure Analysis) software. Spatial distribution is needed for checking and finding dangerous step and touch voltages above and around the <b>transformer</b> <b>station.</b> Apparent earth resistivity data is measured and analyzed using the RESAP module of the CDEGS software. Because of the very high current flow into the grounding system during a single line to ground fault or a three phase fault in the <b>transformer</b> <b>station,</b> very high and dangerous potentials can be induced on the metallic structures including the fence, which can cause dangerous situations for people and animals near the station and for the personnel inside the station. The PLOT module of CDEGS is used to view the results of the scalar potential, step and touch voltage on the surface. Graphic displays include equipotent contour lines and potential profiles (gradients) in 3 D and 2 D perspective and apparent soil resistivity (Wm) versus inter electrode spacing (m). The results of alternative grid designs may be displayed simultaneously for the purpose of comparison...|$|R

On the basis of the load flow simulation of the 110 kV distribution network and calculations of the short-circuit conditions performed by simulation SW LUG two variants of the location of a new 400 / 110 kV <b>transformer</b> <b>station</b> were assessed. The 110 kV network calculations were focused on the evaluation of voltage conditions, the 110 kV lines loading in the standard operating scheme and in failure states according to the N- 1 criterion, short-circuit conditions and losses. On the basis of the computational analyses, the technical measures necessary to ensure the reliable operation of the 110 kV network in the given area are designed and economically evaluated...|$|R
