2500|$|A {{distributed}} Bragg reflector laser (DBR) {{is a type}} {{of single}} frequency laser diode. [...] It is characterized by an optical cavity consisting of an electrically or optically pumped gain region between two mirrors to provide feedback. [...] One of the mirrors is a broadband reflector and the other mirror is wavelength selective so that gain is favored on a single longitudinal mode, resulting in lasing at a single resonant frequency. The broadband mirror is usually coated with a low reflectivity coating to allow emission. [...] The wavelength selective mirror is a periodically structured diffraction grating with high reflectivity. The diffraction grating is within a non-pumped, or passive region of the cavity [...] [...] A DBR laser is a monolithic single chip device with the grating etched into the semiconductor. [...] DBR lasers can be edge emitting lasers or VCSELs. [...] Alternative hybrid architectures that share the same topology include extended cavity diode lasers and volume <b>Bragg</b> <b>grating</b> lasers, but these are not properly called DBR lasers.|$|E
