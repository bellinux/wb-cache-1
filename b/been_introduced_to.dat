5|$|An {{early success}} {{story in the}} 1950s was the saving of the nene (or Hawaiian goose) from extinction. Birds {{were brought to the}} site and {{breeding}} at Slimbridge was successful. Initial releases into the wild in Hawaii were a failure however, because the nene's natural habitat was not protected from the predators that had <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> the islands by man. Once that problem was alleviated, successful reintroduction became possible.|$|E
