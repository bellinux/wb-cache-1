5|$|After the Rainmen {{reached the}} site of the game hours early and began warming up, they were {{discovered}} by Express assistant coach Gerry Brumpton. Windsor head coach Bill Jones later entered the room to retrieve a ball and violence erupted between him and Halifax center Liam McMorrow. This sparked a brawl <b>between</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> teams as a whole, causing police to arrive. The Rainmen eventually left the stadium and chose to not compete in Game 7 because of safety concerns.|$|E
5|$|Prince Norodom Sihanouk {{had ruled}} Cambodia adeptly {{since he had}} wrested {{independence}} from the French on 9 November 1953. He had accomplished this task by deft political maneuvering <b>between</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> {{left and the right}} to achieve what no other ruler or political group in Indochina had managed, a relatively bloodless transition to independence. During the next ten years, while the conflicts in neighboring Laos and South Vietnam heated up, Sihanouk managed to sustain his delicate domestic political balance {{while at the same time}} maintaining his nation's neutrality (guaranteed by the 1954 Geneva Conference that ended the First Indochina War).|$|E
5|$|Trinidad and Tobago {{submitted}} {{a team to}} participate in the 4×100meters relay. Although each relay consists of four people, five Trinidadians were involved <b>between</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> first and second (final) round. During the first round, Trinidad and Tobago participated in the first heat, which consisted of then 20-year-old Port-of-Spain-born Keston Bledman, who only participated in the relay; Marc Burns, who also participated in the men's 100meters; Richard Thompson, who also medaled in the men's 100meters; and Aaron Armstrong, who also ran in the men's 200meters. The relay ran the collective 400meters in 38.26 seconds, placing first in the first heat during the August 21 semifinal (and first) round. Trinidad and Tobago defeated Japan, which placed second in the heat (at 38.52seconds) and the Netherlands, which placed third (38.87seconds). The Trinidadian team placed first overall out of the ten relays that finished, and progressed to the August 22 final round.|$|E

25|$|Post-millennium it {{has been}} debated both whether the written name should include an {{apostrophe}} mark after St James, and, if it does, whether the official written form should include an extra 's' after the apostrophe.

25|$|Ants {{exhibit a}} range of polymorphisms. First, there is their {{characteristic}} haplodiploid sex determination system, whereby all males are haploid, and all females diploid. Second, there is differentiation <b>between</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> females and males based mostly on feeding of larvae, which determines, for example, whether the imago is capable of reproduction. Lastly, there is differentiation of size and 'duties' (particularly of females), which are usually controlled by feeding and/or age, but which may sometimes be genetically controlled. Thus the order exhibits both genetic polymorphism and extensive polyphenism.|$|E

25|$|Unlike in Garratt's patent, Tasmanian Railways {{insisted on}} a {{compound}} arrangement with cylinders facing inwards, {{in order to reduce}} the distances <b>between</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> main steam pipe and the high-pressure cylinders, and between the high-pressure and low-pressure cylinders. This made the locomotive unnecessarily complicated and placed the high-pressure cylinders directly underneath the cab, making it uncomfortably hot, especially in summer. The pattern was not repeated on later Garratt designs. Only one more Garratt locomotive, again built by Beyer, Peacock & Co. in 1927, was produced with compound propulsion for the Burma Railways.|$|E
25|$|In football, six Asian teams—Afghanistan, Burma, India, Indonesia, Iran, and Japan—participated. The {{gold medal}} was {{won by the}} Indian team, who {{defeated}} Iran 1–0 in the final. Japan defeated Afghanistan, 2–0 to win the bronze medal. In semifinals, two matches were played in between Iran and Japan to decide one of the finalists, as first match played on 7 March remained goalless, even match went for overtime; on a next day a replay semifinal match was played in <b>between</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> teams in which Iran defeated Japan with a goal difference of 3 to 2.|$|E
25|$|An {{underground}} {{system does}} not exist in Manchester but there was a proposal to create an underground system in the 1970s. The Picc-Vic tunnel was proposed to link Piccadilly and Victoria stations with a number of stations <b>between</b> <b>both.</b> <b>The</b> proposal was shelved due to cost and was deemed impractical with Manchester's network of tunnels and building basements from the Victorian era creating construction difficulties. The Guardian exchange which doubles up as a nuclear bunker also has a series of interconnected tunnels running under Manchester which total over six miles in length and 60 metres (180 feet) in depth in certain areas.|$|E

25|$|Arkansas {{is known}} for extreme weather and {{frequent}} storms. A typical year brings thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, snow and ice storms. <b>Between</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> Great Plains and the Gulf States, Arkansas receives around 60 days of thunderstorms. Arkansas is located in Tornado Alley, and as a result, {{a few of the}} most destructive tornadoes in U.S. history have struck the state. While sufficiently far from the coast to avoid a direct hit from a hurricane, Arkansas can often get the remnants of a tropical system, which dumps tremendous amounts of rain in a short time and often spawns smaller tornadoes.|$|E
25|$|Even {{after the}} party split, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Communist Party cadres {{remained}} unified in the All India Trade Union Congress. After the short-lived coexistence <b>between</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> Parties broke down in Kerala and also in West Bengal similar rupture happened, the trade union wing also split. In December 1969, eight Communist Party of India (Marxist) members walked out of an All India Trade Union Congress executive committee meeting. Later, the Marxist break-away members would organise an All India Trade Union Conference in Calcutta, on 28–31 May 1970. The Calcutta conference was the founding conference of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, new Communist Party of India (Marxist) trade union.|$|E
25|$|Barbary corsairs led attacks upon American {{merchant}} shipping {{in an attempt}} to extort ransom for the lives of captured sailors, and ultimately tribute from the United States to avoid further attacks, as they did with the various European states. Before the Treaty of Paris, which formalized the United States' independence from Great Britain, U.S. shipping was protected by France during the revolutionary years under the Treaty of Alliance (1778–83). Although the treaty does not mention the Barbary States in name, it refers to common enemies <b>between</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> U.S. and France. As such, piracy against U.S. shipping only began to occur {{after the end of the}} American Revolution, when the U.S. government lost its protection under the Treaty of Alliance.|$|E

Go-Ahead operates from Eldon Square bus station, providing the majority of services south of the river in Gateshead, South Tyneside, Sunderland, and County Durham. Stagecoach is the primary operator in the city proper, with cross-city services mainly <b>between</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> West and East ends via the city centre with some services extending out to the MetroCentre, Killingworth, Wallsend and Ponteland. Bus services in Newcastle upon Tyne and the surrounding boroughs part of the Tyne & Wear area are coordinated by Nexus, the Tyne & Wear Passenger Transport Executive.|$|E
25|$|As Tsubasa is {{connected}} with xxxHolic, the characters' designs are also meant to be similar. Like xxxHolic, the artwork is sometimes influenced by Ukiyo-e art style {{which leads to the}} characters have longer limbs. Another similarity <b>between</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> series is the use of one-eyed characters or people who lost their sight, which is meant to express the feelings from them. The characters of Fai D. Flowright and Kurogane were created in order to have adult characters who would side with Syaoran, who was much younger and was still in development during the series' start. As a result of the manga being aimed at young male demographic, characters are designed to appeal of them such as Syaoran who appears as an action hero. In order to make fights more entertaining Clamp decided to include yells of fighting techniques {{for the first time in}} a manga of them. Although Kurogane was the only character who did this at first, the authors also planned to make Syaoran do this.|$|E
