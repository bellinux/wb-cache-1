5|$|In {{the very}} {{northern}} {{reaches of the}} Briar Creek watershed, the <b>bedrock</b> {{is made up of}} sandstone. South of the sandstone layer, there is a section of the watershed where the <b>bedrock</b> is mudstone. In {{the central part of the}} watershed, the <b>bedrock</b> is siltstone. In the southern part of the watershed, the <b>bedrock</b> is mostly shale, including the part of the watershed in Berwick, which it has <b>bedrock</b> of calcerous shale.

5|$|Underlying the Albany Pine Bush is a <b>bedrock</b> {{consisting}} of shale and siltstone, laid down 450 {{million years ago}} during the Middle Ordovician. The <b>bedrock</b> is covered by glaciolacustrine deposits which make up the sandy topsoils of the barrens.|$|E
30|$|As {{it can be}} seen in {{the zoning}} map of factor 1, {{correlation}} coefficients of variables in each sample ranged from − 0.93 to + 2.76. High positive correlations existed between the seven elements in the southeast, southwest, and west where igneous and shale <b>bedrocks</b> were present. In contrast, high negative correlations were seen between the seven elements in the east and northwest on shale <b>bedrocks.</b>|$|R
30|$|The hydrogeological {{setting in}} gneissic terrains will {{generate}} a semi-confined aquifer system due to occurrence of coarser regolith that is overlying the largely partially altered <b>bedrocks.</b> The thick weathered units {{will serve as}} both water-bearing zone and a semi-confining unit to the largely partially weathered <b>bedrocks</b> {{that are expected to}} have good water-bearing capacity. Water quality may be poor in these terrains when tapped from the regolith, whereas water from wells that tap into the relatively deeper fractured <b>bedrocks</b> at an average depth of 22.5  m will be safer. Well topography in gneisses has little effect on the groundwater yield, whereas well depth has moderate indirect significance on yield, and deep wells do not support high groundwater yield (Fig.  11 a).|$|R

5|$|In {{its lower}} reaches, the {{surficial}} geology {{in the vicinity}} of Shickshinny Creek consists of urban land highly disrupted by cut and fill, alluvium, alluvial terrace, fill, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift containing stratified sand and gravel, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Delta containing sand and gravel, Wisconsinan Bouldery Till (a glaicial or resedimented till containing boulders, and <b>bedrock</b> consisting of sandstone and shale. The <b>bedrock</b> mainly occurs on the mountains {{in this part of the}} watershed. In the middle reaches of the creek, the surficial geology mainly features <b>bedrock</b> consisting of sandstone and shale, alluvium, and a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till. Some Wisconsinan Outwash and alluvial terrace is also present near Koonsville. Some patches of Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and wetlands are also present. In its upper reaches, the creek is almost entirely dominated by Wisconsinan Till, <b>bedrock,</b> and some lakes. However, there is a patch of alluvial fan immediately north of Shickshinny Lake and some Wisconsinan Bouldery Till and Wisconsinan Outwash not far from the creek's source.|$|E
5|$|Many {{varieties}} of Precambrian <b>bedrock</b> are exposed including: granite, basalt, greenstone, gneiss, {{as well as}} metamorphic rocks derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Greenstone of the Superior craton located near Ely, Minnesota, is up to 2.7billion years old. Igneous rocks of the Duluth Complex comprise the <b>bedrock</b> of the eastern Boundary Waters.

5|$|The <b>bedrock</b> of {{the upper}} part of the river, located in the Mourne Mountains, is {{composed}} of granite formed approximately 50 million years ago (mya). The <b>bedrock</b> of the river as it flows through Tollymore is shale from the Silurian age, more than 400 mya, and it forms step gorges along some sections of the river banks. Dark bands of basalt are found were molten basalt lava was forced through cracks in the <b>bedrock</b> about 60 million years ago. The river bed contains stones and gravel from as far away as Antrim, Tyrone and Scotland, which were carried there by glacial ice sheets during the last ice age.|$|E
5|$|The {{topography}} of the creek's watershed is mountainous in its upper reaches. However, in its lower reaches, the creek flows through a wide valley bordered by steep ridges. The creek's channel is sinuous and flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and limestone, with some iron ore. All of the creek's watershed {{is located in}} the ridge and valley physiographic province. It contains fractured, faulted, and folded sedimentary rocks. While there is some young <b>bedrock</b> in the watershed, parts of it have eroded away to reveal older <b>bedrock,</b> which is more resistant to weathering than the younger <b>bedrock.</b> Old <b>bedrock</b> formations in the watershed include the Tuscarora Formation, the Juniata Formation, and the Bald Eagle Formation. The visible portions of these formations are sandstones and conglomerates. The floor of the Buffalo Creek valley is home to younger carbonates belonging to the Keyser Formation and the Tonoloway Formation.|$|E

The River Tame forms part of the southern boundary, dividing the town from Stalybridge and Dukinfield, and the River Medlock runs to the west.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, a {{predominant}} {{feature of}} the substrata of Manhattan is that the underlying <b>bedrock</b> base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near Midtown Manhattan, dips down lower between 29th Street and Canal Street, then rises toward the surface again in Lower Manhattan. It has been widely believed that the depth to <b>bedrock</b> was the primary underlying reason for the clustering of skyscrapers in the Midtown and Financial District areas, and their absence over the intervening territory between these two areas. However, {{research has shown that}} economic factors played a bigger part in the locations of these skyscrapers.|$|E
30|$|For the {{relationships}} occurring between groundwater discharge, Q, and well topography, the associations are negative across the <b>bedrocks,</b> {{with the exception}} of granitic terrains. In respect to significance of relationships, it is fairly strong in amphibolite (R[*]=[*]− 0.50), moderate in migmatite (R[*]=[*]− 0.39) and weak in gneisses with R[*]=[*]− 0.21 (Fig.  11 d). However, the relationship is very strong and positive in granitic terrain with R[*]=[*] 0.88 (Fig.  11 d). This implied that locations with high topography are characterised by high groundwater yield in granitic terrains, whereas the yield is low in elevated areas underlain by other <b>bedrocks.</b>|$|R
40|$|Moderate {{and high}} radon {{potential}} in Northern Ireland is associated mainly with (i) the Neoproterozoic psammites, semipelites, meta-limestones, volcanics and mafic intrusives of Counties Londonderry and Tyrone; (ii) Silurian Hawick Group greywackes and, {{to a much}} more limited extent Gala Group greywackes, in the southern sector of Counties Armagh and Down; (iii) Ordovician and Silurian acid intrusives and volcanics in eastern Counties Londonderry and Tyrone; (iv) Middle-Late Devonian conglomerates in County Tyrone; (v) Lower Carboniferous (Dinantian) limestone in the western sector of Northern Ireland, especially in County Fermanagh; (vi) Palaeogene and Late Caledonian acid intrusive rocks of the Mourne Mountains Complex, Slieve Gullion Complex and Newry Granodiorite Complex in the SE sector in County Down and County Armagh. Moderate to high radon potential is sometimes associated with glacio-fluvial sand and gravel deposits where these overlie a range of <b>bedrocks,</b> {{some of which have}} relatively low radon potential. In this latter case the enhanced radon potential is probably caused by the high permeability of superficial deposits. Radon potential tends to be lower when <b>bedrocks</b> characterised by moderate or high radon potential are overlain by relatively impermeable silt-clay alluvium, glaciolacustrine, and lacustrine deposits; peat; and glacial till and moraine. Redistribution of rock debris derived from uranium-rich <b>bedrocks,</b> such as the Mourne Mountains granites, through glacial, alluvial and other processes can also result in higher radon potential being associated with superficial deposits relative to underlying <b>bedrocks...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} made of mineral {{composition}} of sand- and silt-sized fractions of recent clastic (riftogenic) sediments and solidified deposits collected {{from the bottom of}} the Romanche Trench during the first voyage of R/V Akademik Kurchatov. Similarity between mineral compositions of sediments and <b>bedrocks</b> (ultrabasites, gabbroids, diabases) was established. This similarity is a basis for considering the mineral complex of the deposits that have been derived from the <b>bedrocks</b> of the trench slopes, and have formed due to their submarine denudation accompanied by tectonic crushing. The same mineral composition was found in pieces of older consolidated deposits; this suggests that conditions of sedimentation similar to those at recent times have existed for a long time in the Romanche Trench...|$|R
