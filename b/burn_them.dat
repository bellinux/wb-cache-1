5|$|After {{the battle}} of Stalingrad in February 1943, Himmler {{realised}} that Germany would likely lose the war, and ordered the formation of Sonderkommando 1005, a special task force under SS-Standartenführer Paul Blobel. The unit's assignment was to visit mass graves on the Eastern Front to exhume bodies and <b>burn</b> <b>them</b> {{in an attempt to}} cover up the genocide. The task remained unfinished {{at the end of the}} war, and many mass graves remain unmarked and unexcavated.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, {{when the}} United States {{landed on the}} Philippines to {{recapture}} it, orders had been sent out by the Japanese high command to kill the POWs {{in order to avoid}} them being rescued by liberating forces. One method of the execution was to round the prisoners up in one location, pour gasoline over them, and then <b>burn</b> <b>them</b> alive. After hearing the accounts of the survivors from the massacre at the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp, the liberating forces feared that the safety of the POWs being held in the country was in jeopardy, and decided to launch a series of rescue operations to save the surviving POWs on the islands.|$|E
5|$|In October 1834 Richard Weobley, the Clerk of Works, {{received}} {{instructions from}} Treasury officials {{to clear the}} old tally sticks while parliament was adjourned. He decided against giving the sticks away to parliamentary staff to use as firewood, and instead opted to <b>burn</b> <b>them</b> in the two heating furnaces of the House of Lords, directly below the peers' chambers. The furnaces had been designed to burn coal—which gives off a high heat with little flame—and not wood, which burns with a high flame. The flues of the furnaces ran up {{the walls of the}} basement in which they were housed, under the floors of the Lords' chamber, then up through the walls and out through the chimneys.|$|E

5|$|Shortland was {{succeeded by}} Captain Charles Inglis in 1808, {{and became the}} {{flagship}} of Rear-Admiral George Martin. Canopus {{was attached to the}} Mediterranean Fleet under Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood and in October 1809 was part of the fleet that gave chase to a French convoy and their escorts under Rear-Admiral François Baudin in the Gulf of Lyons. The French were chased into the mouth of the Rhone, where the 80-gun Robuste and the 74-gun Lion were driven aground, and after attempts to salvage them had failed, the French were forced to <b>burn</b> <b>them.</b> Canopus became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Charles Boyles between 1811 and 1812, after which she was paid off into ordinary again.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{became aware}} of the {{political}} danger associated with the mass burial of corpses in April 1943, when they discovered the Polish victims of the 1940 Soviet Katyn massacre near occupied Smolensk. The bodies of the 10,000 Polish officers executed by the NKVD were well preserved despite their long burial, clearly attesting to the Soviet mass murder. Subsequently, the secret orders to exhume the corpses buried at Treblinka and <b>burn</b> <b>them</b> came directly from the Nazi leadership, possibly from Himmler, who was very concerned about covering up Nazi crimes. The cremations began shortly after his visit to the camp in late February or early March 1943.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{to prevent}} the Dutch from {{refloating}} the grounded ships, Admiral Pellew ordered landing parties to assemble in the boats of his squadron alongside Terpsichore. From there, under distant covering fire from the British frigates, Fleetwood Pellew led the boats against Phoenix, coming under fire from the grounded vessels and gun batteries ashore. Passing through the bombardment from the shoreline, Pellew's men boarded Phoenix {{to find that the}} Dutch crew had just abandoned the vessel, scuttling the frigate as they departed. Although now useless as a ship, Phoenixs guns were turned on the other beached vessels to cover the British boats as they spread out to board and <b>burn</b> <b>them.</b> This operation was followed by the destruction of 20 grounded merchant ships in the harbour, although two others were successfully refloated and captured. In a final act before withdrawing to the squadron offshore, Captain Pellew set fire to the wreck of Phoenix, burning the ship to the waterline. The entire operation was conducted under heavy fire from the shore, but British casualties were only one Royal Marine killed and three men wounded.|$|E

5|$|Howe {{realised}} {{that the}} direction of Villaret's departure would take him directly across Admiral Montagu's planned route, and that, should Montagu meet Villaret, the British squadron would be destroyed. Setting all sail in pursuit, Howe followed Villaret into the Atlantic on 20 May. The next day Howe's ships recaptured ten of the lost Dutch merchantmen, but {{he was forced to}} <b>burn</b> <b>them</b> since crewing them with British sailors would weaken his own already understrength fleet. Prisoners from these ships gave Howe the information that the French fleet was only a short distance ahead, but that it had been joined by an additional ship from Nielly's squadron as well as several frigates. By now satisfied that Montagu was safely to the southwest, Howe pressed on hoped to bring Villaret to battle within the week. On 23 May however, the British fleet was driven southwards by strong winds and had to slowly work its way north to find the French track again. The detour did however enable him to recapture and destroy four more of Villaret's Dutch prizes.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the McCartney {{family moved}} {{for the last}} time to a small three-bedroomed brick-built terrace house at 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, which is now owned by The National Trust. It only cost £1:6s:0d per week, which was due to Mary's {{seniority}} at the hospital. Before moving to Forthlin Road, Jim had been secretary of the Speke Horticultural Society, and had often sent his sons out to canvass for new members. Jim planted dahlias and snapdragons in the front garden of Forthlin Road and regularly trimmed the lavender hedge, although it was Paul's job to collect horse manure from the local streets in a bucket to be dug into the flowerbeds. As Jim was a heavy smoker, Jim would first dry and then crush sprigs of Lavender and then <b>burn</b> <b>them</b> (like incense) in the ashtrays to kill the smell of his cigarette smoke.|$|E
5|$|The Arab {{army was}} well-provisioned, with Arab {{accounts}} reporting high mounds of supplies {{piled up in}} their camp, and had even brought along wheat to sow and harvest the next year. The failure of the Arab navy to blockade the city, however, meant that the Byzantines too could ferry in provisions. In addition, the Arab army had already devastated the Thracian countryside during its march and could not rely on it for foraging. The Arab fleet and the second Arab army, which operated in the Asian suburbs of Constantinople, were able to bring in limited supplies to Maslama's army. As the siege drew into winter, negotiations opened between the two sides, extensively reported by Arab sources but ignored by Byzantine historians. According to the Arab accounts, Leo continued to play a double game with the Arabs. One version claims that he tricked Maslama into handing over most of his grain supplies, while another claims that the Arab general was persuaded to <b>burn</b> <b>them</b> altogether, so as to show {{the inhabitants of the}} city that they faced an imminent assault and induce them to surrender. The winter of 718 was extremely harsh; snow covered the ground for over three months. As the supplies in the Arab camp ran out, a terrible famine broke out: the soldiers ate their horses, camels, and other livestock, and the bark, leaves and roots of trees. They swept the snow of the fields they had sown to eat the green shoots, and reportedly resorted to cannibalism and eating their own excrement. Consequently, the Arab army was ravaged by epidemics; with great exaggeration, the Lombard historian Paul the Deacon put the number of their dead of hunger and disease at 300,000.|$|E

25|$|One method Nilsson {{used for}} murdering the {{children}} {{was to put}} them into a washtub and then place heavy objects—such as a washboard and coal scuttle—on top of them.

On occasions when she did not <b>burn</b> <b>them,</b> she dug graves and buried them.|$|E
25|$|With Japan's {{surrender}} and {{the invasion}} of Korea, Shinto shrines were the focus of contempt {{in the streets of}} Seoul, with papers posted on walls urging citizens to <b>burn</b> <b>them</b> down. As Koreans began pilfering smaller shrines around the country, Shinto priests at Chosen shrine withdrew Japanese relics, and soon created a plan to destroy the Korean National Shrine of their own accord. The site was initially replaced with a Presbyterian Theological Seminary.|$|E

25|$|Johann Juncer {{also created}} a very {{complete}} picture of phlogiston. When reading Stahl's work, he assumed that phlogiston was in fact very material. He therefore {{came to the conclusion}} that phlogiston has the property of levity, or that it makes the compound that it is in much lighter than it would be without the phlogiston. He also showed that air was needed for combustion by putting substances in a sealed flask and trying to <b>burn</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{masks are}} a dancer’s prized possession. Most dancers {{try to keep}} their mask in new {{condition}} and will take masks in to be cleaned and repainted. In a number of communities, such as the Chontals in Tabasco, masks are generally kept in the local church when not in use. At {{the other end of}} the spectrum, the masking, wearing and destruction of a mask is part of Holy Week rituals among the Cora, Yaqui and Mayo. The Cora destroy their paper mache masks by immersing them in a local river while the Yaqui and Mayo <b>burn</b> <b>them.</b> In both cases, it is an act of purification.|$|E
25|$|The pace of killings slowed in 1942, as ghettoised Jewish slave {{workers were}} {{appropriated}} by the Wehrmacht. As Soviet troops advanced in 1943, the Nazi units {{tried to cover}} up the crime under the Aktion 1005 directive. Eighty inmates from the nearby Stutthof concentration camp were formed into Leichenkommando ("corpse units"). The workers were forced to dig up bodies, pile them on wood and <b>burn</b> <b>them.</b> The ashes were then ground up, mixed with sand and buried. After months of this gruesome work, the brigade managed to escape through a tunnel dug with spoons on 19 April 1944. Eleven of the 80 who escaped survived the war; their testimony contributed to revealing the massacre.|$|E

25|$|The Boxer Uprising {{was in part}} a {{reaction}} against Christianity in China. Christianity was prevalent among bandits in Shandong. In 1895, the Manchu Yuxian, a magistrate in the province, acquired {{the help of the}} Big Swords Society in fighting against Bandits. The Big Swords practiced heterodox practices, however, they were not bandits and were not seen as bandits by Chinese authorities. The Big Swords relentlessly crushed the bandits, but the bandits converted to the Catholic Church, because it made them legally immune to prosecution under the protection of the foreigners. The Big Swords proceeded to attack the bandit Catholic churches and <b>burn</b> <b>them.</b> Yuxian only executed several Big Sword leaders, but did not punish anyone else. More secret societies started emerging after this.|$|E
25|$|Controversy {{broke out}} in the Ankara Chamber of Commerce, where the {{overseas}} votes were being counted, when a ballot box that had been recorded to contain 200 votes was actually found to have 276 votes. In accordance to Turkish law, if the actual number of votes exceeds the recorded number, the count leader must choose votes at random and <b>burn</b> <b>them</b> until the numbers are equal. Violence subsequently breaking out, with several other counters who did not know the reason for the burning of votes alleging election fraud. With the tensions continuing to remain high, riot police were called to restore calm, with the burnt votes being impounded by the crime scene investigation unit. It was observed that the burnt votes also contained some cast for the AKP. Tensions also rose briefly after a count leader insisted that an invalid vote that had been cast for both the HDP and AKP should be counted as a valid vote for the HDP.|$|E
25|$|During the night, {{the captains}} of the French fireships did they best {{to fill their}} vessels with gunpowder, and on 6 July, under the escort of 5 sailing ships {{commanded}} by Duquesne, they went to {{set fire to the}} remaining Spanish galleys. All of them were still abandoned, so it was easy for the French to <b>burn</b> <b>them.</b> Both in the naval battle and the attack on the harbor, no more than fifty Frenchmen were killed. Frustrated by their defeat, the Spaniards even put a price on Sourdis' head. The Duke of Fernandina managed to escape with the galleys which had failed to break the French blockade, claiming to have won the battle for having introduced some relief into Tarragona. Some Spanish historians give credit to this claim, but other, like the Catalan Víctor Balaguer, said that the 11 ships which entered the port were not full of supplies but full of men, which worsened the situation in the city and made a second relief necessary.|$|E
