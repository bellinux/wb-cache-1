60|$|In conclusion, {{let me add}} {{one word}} of warning as to certain popular errors about the young fry of sundry {{well-known}} species. Nothing is more common than to hear it asserted that sprats are only immature herring. This is a complete mistake. Believe it not. Sprats are a very distinct species of the herring genus, and they never grow much bigger than when they appear, <b>brochés,</b> at table. The largest adult sprat measures only six inches, while full-grown herring may attain as much as fifteen. Moreover, herring have teeth on the palate, always wanting in sprats, by which means the species may be readily distinguished at all ages. When in doubt, therefore, do not play trumps, but examine the palate. On the other hand, whitebait, long {{supposed to be a}} distinct species, has now been proved by Dr. Günther, the greatest of ichthyologists, to consist chiefly of the fry or young of herring. To complete our discomfiture, the same eminent authority has also shown that the pilchard and the sardine, which we thought so unlike, {{are one and the same}} fish, called by different names according as he is caught off the Cornish coast or in Breton, Portuguese, or Mediterranean waters. Such aliases are by no means uncommon among his class. To say the plain truth, fish are the most variable and ill-defined of animals; they differ so much in different habitats, so many hybrids occur between them, and varieties merge so readily by imperceptible stages into one another, that only an expert can decide in doubtful cases--and every expert carefully reverses the last man's opinion. Let us at least be thankful that whitebait by any other name would eat as nice; that science has not a single whisper to breathe against their connection with lemon; and that whether they are really the young of Clupea harengus or not, the supply at Billingsgate shows no symptom of falling short of the demand.|$|E

40|$|With the {{possible}} exception of international peace and security, global economic development has been the dominant theme in international law and international relations {{since the end of the}} Second World War. The tenor and intensity has varied over the decades, but the objectives, centering on institutional arrangements and programs to promote the global economy, have remained the same. <b>Broches</b> 2 ̆ 7 collection of essays, originally written between 1957 and 1992, attests to his intimate knowledge of the workings of the IBRD and its related agencies. In addition to providing both the history and the jurisprudential analysis of these institutions, these essays constitute a discourse on public as well as private international law. They contribute, moreover, to a progressive development of the international law of foreign investment. Essentially, this is a book about arbitration and dispute settlement, with its history told and explained by one who was present at its creation. <b>Broches</b> puts international arbitration into both the contexts of private and public international law. This book contains twenty-five essays and is divided into six parts: (1) the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development; (2) Registration of Treaties and International Agreements; (3) the International Center for the Settlement of Investment of Disputes; (4) International Commercial Arbitration; (5) Investment Disputes; and (6) a section devoted to miscellaneous topics...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the analysis {{results of the}} copper- based finds, from the important Sicilian necropolis of Madonna del Piano, near Grammichele (Catania), dated between the local Final Bronze Age 2 and the Early Iron Age IA. 122 copper-based finds from the 273 graves (1970 - 71) of the large cemetery have been analysed. The sampled objects belong to different classes, there are for instance weapons of offence and defence, such as swords and greaves, small decorative objects for personal use, such as rings, fibulae, belt hooks, belt decorations, and small tools, such as the knives used by women, reels, needles and razors, but also small functional parts, such as rivets and nails, repairs and even a kind of musical instrument, such as the tintinnabula. The methods employed were AAS and SEM, where possible, and XRF in all cases. The {{aim of the research}} was that of evaluating the skill of the local artisans, of determining the most common copper-based alloys in use in Sicily in this period and comparing the data with the analysis results of contemporary groups of finds from other areas of the Italian peninsula and from other European regions.
