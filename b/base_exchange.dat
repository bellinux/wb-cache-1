25|$|The {{following}} {{is the process}} that was used when rescuing frescoes in La Fenice, a Venetian opera house, but the same process {{can be used for}} similarly damaged frescoes. First, a protection and support bandage of cotton gauze and polyvinyl alcohol is applied. Difficult sections are removed with soft brushes and localized vacuuming. The other areas that are easier to remove (because they had been damaged by less water) are removed with a paper pulp compress saturated with bicarbonate of ammonia solutions and removed with deionized water. These sections are strengthened and reattached then cleansed with <b>base</b> <b>exchange</b> resin compresses and the wall and pictorial layer were strengthened with barium hydrate. The cracks and detachments are stopped with lime putty and injected with an epoxy resin loaded with micronized silica.|$|E
500|$|The storm caused {{significant}} damage and 22 {{deaths in the}} Turks and Caicos Islands and the Bahamas. In Florida, the hardest hit area was Miami-Dade County. Most {{of the city of}} Homestead was destroyed, while at the Richmond Naval Air Station, a fire ignited during the storm burned down three hangars worth $3million (1945USD) each. Throughout the state, the strong winds destroyed 1,632residences and damaged 5,372homes others. Four people died, including the fire chief of the Richmond station. Homestead Army Air Corps Base, to the east of Homestead was completely destroyed. At the base, hurricane winds of [...] "up to 145 miles per hour tore through the Air Field's buildings.

40|$|Exchanging CAD model data among {{heterogeneous}} CAD {{systems is}} indispensable for collaborative product development. Currently, the industry mainly uses the standardized neutral files based methods to implement such exchange. While {{at the same}} time, the application of Web Ontology Language (OWL) file and underlying Semantic Web technologies in CAD model data exchange is gaining importance and popularity within the academia. The coexistence {{of different types of}} methods has generated a series of controversies and questions within the industry and the academia. Yet, can the neutral files <b>based</b> <b>exchange</b> methods completely implement model data exchange among heterogeneous CAD systems? What challenges have been addressed to date by the developed CAD model data exchange standards? Why OWL has been introduced to CAD model data exchange? Does CAD model data exchange really need OWL? Are there any issues in existing neutral files <b>based</b> <b>exchange</b> methods and OWL file <b>based</b> <b>exchange</b> methods need to be addressed in future studies? This paper proposes to conduct a study of the standardized neutral files <b>based</b> <b>exchange</b> methods and OWL file <b>based</b> <b>exchange</b> methods. An in-depth analysis of the widely used STandard for the Exchange of Product model data (STEP) method and the newly emerging OWL methods is firstly provided. Then the paper makes a detailed comparison between these two types of methods based on this analysis. Finally, some issues in the two types of methods {{that need to be addressed}} in the future are discusse...|$|R

40|$|A {{recombinant}} heterodimeric NusB/NusE protein {{complex of}} Escherichia coli was expressed {{under the control}} of a synthetic mini operon. Surface plasmon resonance measurements showed that the heterodimer complex has substantially higher affinity for the boxA RNA sequence motif of the ribosomal RNA (rrn) operons of E. coli as compared to monomeric NusB protein. Single <b>base</b> <b>exchanges</b> in boxA RNA reduced the affinity of the protein complex up to 15 -fold. The impact of <b>base</b> <b>exchanges</b> in the boxA RNA on the interaction with NusB protein was studied by H- 1,N- 15 hetero-correlation NMR spectroscopy. Spectra obtained with modified RNA sequences were analysed by a novel generic algorithm. Replacement of bases in the terminal segments of the boxA RNA motif caused minor chemical shift changes as compared to <b>base</b> <b>exchanges</b> in {{the central part of the}} dodecameric boxA motif.

40|$|We study {{exchange}} coupling {{due to the}} interelectron Coulomb {{interaction between}} two ferromagnetic grains embedded into insulating matrix. This contribution to the exchange interaction complements the contribution due to virtual electron hopping between the grains. We show that the Coulomb and the hopping <b>based</b> <b>exchange</b> interactions are comparable. However, for most system parameters these contributions have opposite signs and compete with each other. In contrast to the hopping <b>based</b> <b>exchange</b> interaction the Coulomb <b>based</b> <b>exchange</b> is inversely proportional to the dielectric constant of the insulating matrix ε. The total intergrain exchange interaction has a complicated dependence on the dielectric permittivity of the insulating matrix. Increasing ε one can observe the ferromagnet-antiferromagnet (FM-AFM) and AFM-FM transitions. For certain parameters no transition is possible, however even {{in this case the}} exchange interaction has large variations, changing its value by three times with increasing the matrix dielectric constant.
