On 9 April, Pattle claimed a Junkers Ju 88 (actually a Do 17) damaged. He left the <b>burning</b> <b>machine</b> as it disappeared into cloud. Pattle received confirmation that the aircraft crashed and he drove out with a member of the squadron to bring back souvenirs. On 10 April, he flew as fighter escort for No. 11 Squadron Blenheims on a mission over Betjol, Yugoslavia. They were attacked by flights of Messerschmitt Bf 110s and Bf 109s. Pattle shot down a Bf 110 which was seen to crash in flames and a Bf 109 whose pilot bailed out. On Good Friday, Pattle led his squadron into battle against German bombers minelaying over Volos harbour. He dispatched a Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 into the sea. The successes represented his 33rd and 34th aerial victories.|$|E

He was 29 years old, and in command of No. 3 Squadron RNAS. His {{citation}} read: The KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the grant of the Victoria Cross to Squadron-Commander Richard Bell Davies, D.S.O., R.N., and of the Distinguished Service Cross to Flight Sub-Lieutenant Gilbert Formby Smylie, R.N., in recognition of their behaviour in the following circumstances:—On the 19th November these two officers carried out an air attack on Ferrijik Junction. Flight Sub-Lieutenant Smylie's machine was received by very heavy fire and brought down. The pilot planed down over the station, releasing all his bombs except one, which failed to drop, simultaneously at the station from a very low altitude. Thence he continued his descent into the marsh.On alighting he saw the one unexploded bomb, and set fire to his machine, knowing that the bomb would ensure its destruction. He then proceeded towards Turkish territory.At this moment he perceived Squadron-Commander Davies descending, and fearing that he would come down near the <b>burning</b> <b>machine</b> and thus risk destruction from the bomb, Flight Sub-Lieutenant Smylie ran back and from a short distance exploded the bomb {{by means of a}} pistol bullet. Squadron-Commander Davies descended at a safe distance from the <b>burning</b> <b>machine,</b> took up Sub-Lieutenant Smylie, in spite of the near approach of a party of the enemy, and returned to the aerodrome, a feat of airmanship that can seldom have been equalled for skill and gallantry.|$|E

40|$|Application {{of carbon}} based low Z {{materials}} to PFM has significantly improved plasma parameters in large tokamaks. There are, however, serious concerns of erosion, neutron damage etc. for application of low Z materials in future D-T <b>burning</b> <b>machine.</b> To apply high Z metals to PFM, {{there are several}} issues to be solved; high Z impurity production by sputtering, their accumulation in plasma center, and high radiation loss. Because of these concerns high Z metals are not widely employed nor planned {{to be used in}} the present large tokamaks. Since our efforts have been concentrated to optimize the low Z materials, little systematic investigations for high Z materials in tokamak have been done, lacking data base especially those concerning the impacts on plasma core.

40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} plastic (CFRP) composites are in demand {{for a variety of}} applications due to their superior properties. Drilling is involved in many CFRP applications. Experiments have been successfully conducted to use rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM) for CFRP drilling. These experiments were conducted using either cutting fluids or cold air as coolant. RUM of CFRP composites without cutting fluids can eliminate problems caused by cutting fluids, such as high cost of cutting fluids and their disposal, pollution to the environment, and harm to human health. However, dry machining (machining without cutting fluids) also has its limitations, such as <b>burning</b> of <b>machined</b> surface, more friction and adhesion between tool and workpiece, and reduction in tool life. This article presents an experimental study on feasible regions in rotary ultrasonic machining of CFRP using cold air as coolant. Three criteria (<b>burning</b> of <b>machined</b> surface, delamination, and tool blockage) were used to determine feasible regions. Each of four input variables (feedrate, tool rotation speed, ultrasonic power, and cold air pressure) was changed over a wide range so that its feasible region could be found...|$|R

40|$|PaperPg. 70 - 82. As {{the decade}} of the 1970 's {{gradually}} unfolds, it becomes clear {{that it will be a}} decade of challenge for many of you who are engaged in the Process, Pipeline, or Electric utility Industries. The changing 11 orld supplies of fuel resources have already had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on your business. The most significant event that has occurred has been the growing shortage of domestic natural gas. Current studies indicate this shortage will continue for the foreseeable future. Faced with this dilemma, it becomes necessary for those of you who are gas turbine users to give consideration to the burning of liquid fuels in your machines. This paper will summarize some recent developments in General Electric Co. Heavy Duty Gas Turbines which provide them with the capability of burning a wide variety of liquid fuels. Included among these fuels are distillates, crudes, blends, and residuals. The ability to turn these liquid fuels can be provided along with existing natural gas burning capabilities, so that the gas turbines are true multiple fuel <b>burning</b> <b>machines.</b> In many cases, existing field machines can be upgraded to achieve these capabilities. For new machines, the necessary hardware requirement 5 may be specified when the purchase documents are prepared. Before reviewing specific details of hardware and fuel requirements necessary for these capabilities, it might be useful to summarize some of the General Electric Co. heavy duty gas turbine experience in these fields...|$|R

This twofold study has investigated the impact of short circuit and the impact of short circuit positions on total power loss. Multiple shorts have been applied at different positions. It has been found that the induced eddy-currents are largely dependent on the fault position (edge burrs) and the number of shorted laminations even when only two laminations are involved. This study was further extended to include power loss separation into three components, the power loss separation has been applied to the case of higher power losses obtained under specific short circuit conditions at different magnetizing frequencies. Power loss separation has shown a significant increase in eddy current loss components with increasing number of shorted laminations...|$|R

The collection of experimental data consisted of ignition measurements in shock tubes and rapid compression <b>machines,</b> <b>burning</b> velocity measurements, and species profiles measured using shock tubes, flow reactors, and jet-stirred reactors. The experimental conditions covered wide ranges of temperatures (800 - 2500 K), pressures (0. 5 - 50 bar), equivalence ratios (phi = 0. 3 - 5. 0), and C/H ratios (0 - 3). In total, 48 Arrhenius parameters and 5 third-body collision efficiency parameters of 18 elementary reactions were optimized using these experimental data. A large number of directly measured rate coefficient values belonging to 15 of the reaction steps were also utilized. The optimization {{has resulted in a}} H- 2 /CO combustion mechanism, which is applicable {{to a wide range of}} conditions. Moreover, new recommended rate parameters with their covariance matrix and temperature-dependent uncertainty ranges of the optimized rate coefficients are provided. The optimized mechanism was compared to 19 recent hydrogen and syngas combustion mechanisms and is shown to provide the best reproduction of the experimental data. (C) 2016 The Authors.
