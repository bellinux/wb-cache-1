A forward linkage is created when investment in a particular project encourages investment in subsequent stages of production. A <b>backward</b> <b>linkage</b> is created when a project encourages investment in facilities that enable the project to succeed. Normally, projects create both forward and backward linkages. Investment should be made in those projects that have the greatest total number of linkages. Projects with many linkages will vary from country to country; knowledge about project linkages can be obtained through input and output studies.|$|E

Combining the case study, descriptive and econometric evidence suggests that <b>backward</b> <b>linkage</b> creation has failed in terms of upstream high-technology suppliers in food machinery, but succeeded in low-technology linkages with Polish farmers. However, the latter effect only results for those multinational linkages from the food industry to agriculture involving firms of non-EU origin.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the technological innovative capabilities of local suppliers in Malaysia's electrical and electronics industries. The technologically innovative capabilities of local suppliers are assumed to be influenced by the <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> provided by Malaysian subsidiaries of transnational corporation (TNC). TNCs have {{played a key role in}} Malaysia's industrial development. Their long history started in 1960 s with export oriented strategies taken by US, Japanese and European-based TNCs. In addition, increasing globalisation contributes to the creation of contemporary TNC subsidiaries in a high number of countries which have strong international production netWorking. TNCs playa crucial role in the globalisation process, with an increasing control over productive activities in many countries in the world. The broad research questions of the thesis deal with the variables which affect the breadth or diversity of <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> between subsidiaries and local suppliers. Factors explored include 1) the corporate strategy of subsidiaries including outsourcing activities, 2) the technological capability level of local suppliers, 3) the technological development path of local suppliers, 4) inter-organisational linkages between local suppliers and subsidiaries, and 5) specific factors, e. g. nationality of ownership of subsidiaries, region of location, and university and government linkages. Selected theoretical approaches are reviewed to explain the basis for evolution of the roles of TNC subsidiaries, and SMEs in developing countries. In order to analyse these two actors' interactions for technological-related activities, theories related to <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> and technological innovation in developing countries are reviewed, as well as issues, of national innovative systems (NIS), and I environmental factors external to the two main actors. This study utilises an interview survey of TNC subsidiaries and local suppliers in the Malaysian electric and electronics industry to explore the factors influencing upgrading technological capabilities of local suppliers through the <b>backward</b> <b>linkages.</b> A total of 46 TNC subsidiaries and 24 local suppliers participated in the survey. Face to face interviews and factory visits were undertaken for all participating subsidiaries and suppliers in the states of Selangor and Penang. The study uses three analytical frameworks; subsidiary typology, supplier typology and the forms of <b>backward</b> <b>linkages.</b> Descriptive statistics, non-parametric analysis, an OLS regression model, and case studies were used in the analysis. The findings suggest that, as globalisation has increased, the roles of TNC subsidiaries located in Malaysia have shifted, and they have developed a higher autonomy level, which has increased the number as well as either breadth or diversity of <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> offered to local suppliers. <b>Backward</b> <b>linkages</b> provided by subsidiaries significantly affect local suppliers' technological innovative capabilities. Subsidiaries' motivations for <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> are especially positively affected by their production networking. The breadth or diversity of <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> is affected by the roles ofsubsidiaries, rather than the nationality of origin. Local suppliers' technological levels are highly correlated with process and training linkages as well as backward linkages-related government programmes. Thus the role of <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> as part of the institutional environment in the contest of NIS is crucial for the technological development process of local suppliers.

40|$|While {{foreign direct}} {{investment}} (FDI) is regarded as an effective channel of technology transfer, {{the question of whether}} or not FDI helps to upgrade the technological capacities of firms in host countries remains an important one for policy makers. The study presented here is based on a firm-level analysis of petrochemical firms in two Malaysian industrial regions, namely Pasir Gudang in Johor, and Gebeng in Pahang. This research is concerned with technological capability of local suppliers in the petrochemical industry in Malaysia. The technological capabilities of local suppliers are assumed to have been upgraded by the <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> provided by the multinational company (MNC) subsidiaries that located in Malaysia after the country decided to host petrochemical plant in the 1970 s. Together with the country’s national oil company, Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas), MNC subsidiaries played a key role in bringing the technology of the petrochemical industry to Malaysia in the 1980 s. Studies indicate that MNCs are playing a crucial role in the current globalization process and are expected to increase their control over productive activities in many countries, especially in Malaysia’s part of the world. They are expected to increase their activities in the foreseeable future. The research questions of this study deal with the variables that affect the diversity of <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> between subsidiaries and local suppliers. Factors explored include the corporate strategy of MNCs, the technological capability of local suppliers, inter-organizational linkages between MNCs and local suppliers, and other specific factors, such as the ownership structure and size of MNCs. This study utilizes an interview survey of MNC subsidiaries and local suppliers in the Malaysian petrochemical industry to explore the factors influencing the upgrading of technological capability of local suppliers through <b>backward</b> <b>linkages.</b> A total of 9 MNCs and 18 local suppliers have so far participated in the survey. (This is based on the population of 27 MNCs in the Malaysian petrochemical industry in the two regions surveyed. Some firms are reluctant to participate). The findings suggest that the roles of MNCs located in Malaysia have shifted. They have developed a higher level of autonomy. This has increased the diversity of <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> offered to local suppliers. However, the number of <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> formed is still dependent on the ownership structure of the firms. Wholly local-owned MNCs have more strength in <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> than joint ventures, which in turn are stronger in <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> than wholly foreign-owned MNCs. MNCs that are wholly foreign-owned do not produce as many linkages as other companies unless they are embedded in the host country. Thus, <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> provided by subsidiaries can significantly affect local suppliers’ technological capabilities. At the same time, the motivation of MNCs to create <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> is positively affected by their production networking, and the diversity of <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> they create is believed to be affected by the specific roles the subsidiaries play, rather than by the nationality of the firms involved. Local firms in developing countries find themselves in a weak position when bargaining with MNCs. Support from the government, industry associations or international organizations can contribute to improving their bargaining position (Lauridsen, 2004). In the case of Malaysia, Petronas as the anchor company for the Vendor Development Program (VDP) has become a tool for technology transfer. Petronas has brought technology into Malaysia and has become an enabler for the country to upgrade the technological capabilities of local suppliers in the petrochemical industry. In this regard, Petronas has acted as an intermediary in bargaining by local suppliers...|$|R

In contrast to existing literature on firms' productivity, which uses a firm-level dataset to conclude that exporting activities make no contribution to productivity growth of firms, the authors find that backward linkages {{are the most important}} spillover channel for exporting firms. Also, the current study finds that export destinations are an important factor in supporting linkage spillovers; only exporting to developed countries creates <b>backward</b> <b>linkage</b> spillovers. Moreover, exporting firms gain most spillovers from backward linkages. Finally, the authors show that productivity spillovers from domestic suppliers are more important than outsourcing...|$|E

I have conducted field work in the Czech manufacturing sector and built a unique data set that enabled me to construct firm-level measures of <b>backward</b> and forward <b>linkages.</b> My results provide {{strong support for the}} existence of productivity spillovers through <b>backward</b> <b>linkages.</b> FDI, spillovers, forward–backward linkages...|$|R

Taking into account econometric problems that may have biased results of earlier studies, it provides evidence of positive FDI spillovers occurring through <b>backward</b> <b>linkages.</b> In other words, the data indicate that firms in industries supplying sectors with greater multinational presence enjoy higher productivity. Further, {{the findings suggest that}} spillovers take place if <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> are associated with domesticmarket-oriented multinationals but not with those focused mainly on exporting. Similarly, positive spillovers are observed only in connection with partially-owned rather than fully-owned foreign projects. The data also indicate that the initial technological gap between foreign and domestic producers in sourcing sectors does not inhibit spillovers and that firms which possess limited exporting experience are more likely to benefit from <b>backward</b> <b>linkages.</b> There is no robust evidence of positive spillovers taking place through multinational presence in the same sector...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine {{technology}} transfer through <b>backward</b> <b>linkages</b> between multinational enterprises and local suppliers. This issue is of great interest for several reasons. First of all, the new theory of economic growth suggests that technological innovations are becoming an increasingly important contributor to economic growth. Secondly, an obvious policy issue for governments is whether or not incentives should be offered to multinational firms in order to attract them. The econometric analysis presented here is based on a firm level database from Spain for the period 1990 - 2000. We use the Olley and Pakes method to estimate the total factor productivity of the firms and measure the effect of downstream FDI on local firm productivity and find positive evidence on the existence of technology transfer through <b>backward</b> <b>linkages.</b> Our results show strong evidence on technology spillovers through <b>backward</b> <b>linkages,</b> especially in the case of export-oriented affiliates and fully-owned affiliates.
