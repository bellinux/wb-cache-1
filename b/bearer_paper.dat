40|$|This {{thesis is}} about female mate choice and its {{influence}} on two most typical phenotype characteristics of sexually dimorphic passerines (Aves, Passeriformes) : their colouration and song. This thesis reviews a range of scientific papers focused on this problematic. Results of these papers show that both colouration and song can serve as an honest signal and give information about health, condition and other characteristics of its <b>bearer.</b> Many <b>papers</b> also indicate that females put such male signals into account when choosing a mate. Special emphasis in this thesis is put on papers which dealt both with colouration and song. Although {{the number of such}} papers is very low, {{it is clear that the}} quite widely accepted opinion that brightly coloured birds do not sing quite melodic songs and vice versa is generally not quite correct. The biggest problem in the study of female mate choice is the lack of papers which dealt with more than one phenotype characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The weak {{deflationist}} about {{truth is}} committed to two theses: one conceptual, the other ontological. On the conceptual thesis (what {{might be called a}} ‘triviality thesis’), the content of the truth predicate is exhausted by its involvement in some version of the ‘truth-schema’. On the ontological thesis, truth is a deflated property of truth <b>bearers.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> I focus on weak deflationism’s ontological thesis, arguing that it generates an instability in its view of truth: the view threatens to collapse into either that of strong deflationism (i. e., truth is not a property) or that of some form of inflationism (i. e., truth is a substantial property). The instability objection to weak deflationism is sketched by way of a truth-property ascription dilemma, the two horns of which its proponent is at pains to circumvent...|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} of securities holding, transfer and collateral has significantly {{changed over the}} past 200 years – moving from paper certificates and issuer registers to an intermediated environment, {{and from there to}} computerisation and globalisation. These changes made transacting more efficient and thus rendered markets more liquid. However, the law has lagged behind and is now itself an obstacle to efficiency because international securities transactions are subject to considerable legal uncertainty. The latest global market development, a cryptographic transfer process commonly called ‘the blockchain’, is the most recent efficiency-enhancing change. It offers a unique possibility to create a consistent legal framework for securities from scratch, {{on the basis of a}} legal concept that to some extent resembles <b>bearer</b> securities. This <b>paper</b> shows what the new international legal framework could look like, in the light of experience gained from earlier developments...|$|R
40|$|The recodification of {{commercial}} and civil law in the Czech Republic {{has resulted in a}} new concept for the legislation relating to securities.

This assessment will be based on an appraisal of the importance of bearer shares for capital business in the Czech Republic and the effects the new legislation is expected to bring about. The article will also consider possible alternatives in the behavior of shareholders (investors) who prefer to remain anonymous...|$|R
40|$|According to {{one popular}} {{criterion}} of property identity, where X and Y are properties, X is identical with Y if {{and only if}} X and Y bestow the same conditional powers on their <b>bearers.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> I argue that this causal criterion of property identity is unsatisfactory, because it fails to provide a sufficient condition for the identification of properties. My argument for this claim is based on the observation that the summing of properties does not entail the summing of the conditional powers that they bestow on an object, but, rather, in some cases their subtraction. If so, the following causal structure seems possible: There are two properties, A and B. Each bestows a different set of conditional powers on its bearer, but the conjunctive property A-and-B bestows exactly the same set of conditional powers as either A or B. If this causal structure is possible, then it creates a serious problem for the causal criterion of property identity...|$|R
40|$|As the IMS {{represents}} an overlaying architecture, {{it is not}} limited to a single type of access network. However, the switching logic between different access networks is not provided by the IMS on its own. In fact this logic has to be integrated into a dedicated application server. Such an application server manages the transmission of multimedia streaming sessions over different access networks (UMTS, DVB-H, WiFi etc.) via different transmission schemes (unicast, multicast, broadcast). These multimedia streaming sessions are to be controlled within a stateful session management. This component has to be aware of both the content provider's delivery and the user's receiving behavior. Additionally the session management needs {{to be aware of the}} access network and the transmission scheme regarding the current user, network or content context to guarantee QoS and ensure the efficiency in providing this service delivery from network side. As a result, the session manager covers mobility aspects like session mobility and <b>bearer</b> mobility. This <b>paper</b> proposes and describes a session management enabler for a real time multimedia streaming architecture in the scope of quadruple play on top of the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the debate {{as to whether}} something can have final value in virtue of its relational (i. e., non-intrinsic) properties, or, more briefly put, whether final value must be intrinsic. The paper adopts {{the perspective of the}} fitting-attitude analysis (FA analysis) of value, and argues that from this perspective, there is no ground for the requirement that things may have final value only in virtue of their intrinsic properties, but that there might be some grounds for the alternate requirement that final value be grounded only in the essential properties of their <b>bearers.</b> First, the <b>paper</b> introduces the key elements of the FA analysis, and sets aside an obvious but unimportant way in which this analysis makes all final values relational. Second, it discusses some classical counterexamples to the view that final value must be intrinsic. Third, it discusses the relation between final, contributive, and signatory value. Fourth, it examines Zimmerman’s defense of the requirement that final value must be intrinsic on the grounds that final value cannot be derivative. And finally, it explores the alternative requirement that something may have final value in virtue of its essential properties...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that low-quality individuals will be more susceptible to fluctuating asymmetries than high-quality individuals. This leads to high-quality individuals, which produce large ornaments, also producing symmetrical ones, and likewise, low-quality individuals produce small asymmetrical ones. Negative relations between ornament size and asymmetry have been demonstrated. However, these results are also consistent with the view that individuals producing larger ornaments are constrained to more symmetrical development. This will be true whenever possession of an ornament imposes mechanical or aerodynamic costs on its <b>bearer.</b> In this <b>paper</b> I suggest a new hypothesis which aims to explain the observed patterns of asymmetry in such ornaments. In any signalling system there must be constraints on cheating to prevent low-quality individuals from advertising to the same level as high-quality individuals, as it will be in the interests of low-quality individuals to cheat. Therefore, high-quality individuals should seek signalling dimensions in which cheating is not profitable. It has been shown that in ornaments such as elongated tails there are aerodynamic and mechanical reasons to expect the cost of a given amount of asymmetry to increase with tail length. This disproportionate increase in costs induced by asymmetry might act as a barrier against the development of large traits by low-quality individuals, because these individuals will produce more asymmetrical ornaments. This will result in low-quality individuals developing short, asymmetrical tails, and high-quality individuals long, symmetrical ones. This interpretation implies that asymmetry is not a signal in itself, but a part of the evolutionary design of the signalling system which constrains cheating. Receivers can still obtain information on individual quality from the degree of asymmetry, but only if trait size is also assessed, because the asymmetry of an ornament is not independent {{of the size of the}} trait. Predictions which arise from this hypothesis regarding patterns of asymmetry in various types of ornament are discussed. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
