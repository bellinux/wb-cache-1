5|$|June 3, 2013: President Barack Obama signs {{into law}} a {{revised version of}} the Stolen Valor Act, making it a federal offense for someone to pass {{themselves}} off as awardees of medals for valor {{in order to receive}} <b>benefits</b> <b>or</b> other privileges (such as grants, educational benefits, housing, etc.) that are set aside for veterans and other service members.|$|E
5|$|Pension Claims: As {{identity}} theft occurs when someone uses a persons personal information, such as Social Security number without their permission to commit fraud by claiming their <b>benefits</b> <b>or</b> {{that of a}} relation. The Lebanese Identity Card identifies a Lebanese Identity Card holder as the rightful and only person authorized to receive their pension benefits. In the event of the Lebanese Identity Card holder's death, only their children or spouse will benefit from their pension claim.|$|E
5|$|The poem is {{described}} as a poem of water and hope. It begins with images of the sea, water, and of Eliot's past; this water later becomes a metaphor for life and how humans act. This transitions into an image of a ringing bell and a discussion on time and prayer. Images of men drowning dominate the section before leading into how science and ideas on evolution separate mankind from properly understanding the past. This ends with Krishna stating that the divine will, and not future <b>benefits</b> <b>or</b> rewards, matters. The fourth section is a prayer to the Virgin Mary for fishermen, sailors, and the drowned.|$|E

5|$|Band Hero has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from gaming critics. Most recognized {{the game as}} having the same feature sets as Guitar Hero 5, including any <b>benefits</b> <b>or</b> flaws that may come from that. Reviewers praised the reuse of the Guitar Hero 5 features such as the Party Play mode that allows for players to jump in and out, the improved Career mode, and the improved GHTunes. Some identified that the target market of the game appears to be towards teenage girls, such as the featuring of Taylor Swift, the color schemes used in the game, {{and other parts of}} the song selection. Reviewers noted that setlist would be the strongest measure of whether players should purchase the game. The reviewers also commented on the smaller setlist, which contains only 65 songs compared to Guitar Hero 5s 85.|$|E
5|$|Most {{animals are}} euthanized after {{being used in}} an experiment. Sources of {{laboratory}} animals vary between countries and species; most animals are purpose-bred, while a minority {{are caught in the}} wild or supplied by dealers who obtain them from auctions and pounds. Supporters of the use of animals in experiments, such as the British Royal Society, argue that virtually every medical achievement in the 20th century relied on the use of animals in some way. The Institute for Laboratory Animal Research of the United States National Academy of Sciences has argued that animal research cannot be replaced by even sophisticated computer models, which are unable to deal with the extremely complex interactions between molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organisms and the environment. Animal rights and some animal welfare organizations—such as PETA and BUAV—question the need for and legitimacy of animal testing, arguing that it is cruel and poorly regulated, that medical progress is actually held back by misleading animal models that cannot reliably predict effects in humans, that some of the tests are outdated, that the costs outweigh the <b>benefits,</b> <b>or</b> that animals have the intrinsic right not to be used or harmed in experimentation.|$|E

25|$|Roughly 250,000 {{merchant}} seamen served (many under combat conditions) during World War II. The Merchant Marine service {{suffered the}} highest casualty rate of any service during the war. However, {{they were not}} recognized as military veterans and {{were not able to}} obtain veteran's <b>benefits</b> <b>or</b> health care.|$|E

25|$|Maximizing total <b>benefits</b> <b>or</b> utilitarianism can be {{accomplished}} by saving the most lives or by prognosis (life years). While saving the most lives is best if all else is equal, all else is seldom equal. Going by prognosis alone might unfairly favor improving the health of a person who is healthy to begin with.|$|E
25|$|People {{sometimes}} relocate {{from one}} country to another, either permanently or on a limited-time basis. This presents challenges to businesses, governments, and individuals seeking to ensure future <b>benefits</b> <b>or</b> having to deal with taxation authorities in multiple countries. To that end, the Social Security Administration has signed treaties, often referred to as Totalization Agreements, with other social insurance programs in various foreign countries.|$|E
25|$|Civilian {{deaths were}} {{established}} as 38,239, which represented 37.9 {{percent of total}} deaths. Bosniaks accounted for 81.3 percent of those civilian deaths, compared to Serbs 10.9 percent and Croats 6.5 percent. The proportion of civilian victims is, moreover, an absolute minimum because the status of 5,100 victims was unestablished and because relatives had registered their dead loved ones as military victims {{in order to obtain}} veteran's financial <b>benefits</b> <b>or</b> for 'honour' reasons.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with the}} more {{traditional}} business transactions the critical intangible exchanges are also mapped. Intangible exchanges are those mostly informal knowledge exchanges and <b>benefits</b> <b>or</b> support that build relationships and keep things running smoothly. These informal exchanges are actually the key to creating trust and opening pathways for innovation and new ideas. Traditional business practices ignore these important intangible exchanges, but they are made visible with a value network analysis.|$|E
25|$|Advocacy is {{a burgeoning}} support field {{for people with}} {{developmental}} disabilities. Advocacy groups now exist in most jurisdictions, working collaboratively with people with disabilities for systemic change (such as changes in policy and legislation) and for changes for individuals (such as claiming welfare <b>benefits</b> <b>or</b> when responding to abuse). Most advocacy groups also work to support people, throughout the world, to increase their capacity for self-advocacy, teaching the skills necessary for people to advocate for their own needs.|$|E
25|$|Proponents {{and opponents}} have been both criticized for overstating the <b>benefits</b> <b>or</b> overstating the risks, and understating the other, respectively. Systematic reviews have cited {{the lack of}} high quality {{research}} for the benefits and risks of water fluoridation and questions that are still unsettled. Researchers who oppose the practice state this as well. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report on fluoride in drinking water, these gaps in the fluoridation scientific literature fuel the controversy.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, the PPACA {{created the}} Independent Payment Advisory Board (“IPAB”), which is {{empowered}} to submit legislative proposals {{to reduce the}} cost of Medicare if the program’s per-capita spending grows faster than per-capita GDP plus one percent. While the IPAB would be barred from rationing care, raising revenue, changing <b>benefits</b> <b>or</b> eligibility, increasing cost sharing, or cutting payments to hospitals, its creation {{has been one of the}} more controversial aspects of health reform. In 2016, the Medicare Trustees projected that the IPAB will have to convene in 2017 and make cuts effective in 2019.|$|E
25|$|Thermoeconomics {{is based}} on the {{proposition}} that the role of energy in biological evolution should be defined and understood through the second law of thermodynamics, but also in terms of such economic criteria as productivity, efficiency, and especially the costs and <b>benefits</b> (<b>or</b> profitability) of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work. As a result, thermoeconomics is often discussed in the field of ecological economics, which itself is related to the fields of sustainability and sustainable development.|$|E

Additionally, several Bahá’í holy sites were destroyed in the revolution's aftermath, including {{the house of the}} Báb in Shiraz, the house of Bahá'u'lláh at Takur (in Mazandaran), and the resting place of Muhammad-Ali Barfurushi (Quddús) in Tehran.|$|E
