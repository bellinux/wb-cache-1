500|$|According to U.S. border surveillance, a white Mercury Grand Marquis with Mexican {{license plates}} 821-THE7 crossed at Brownsville <b>border</b> <b>entry</b> at 6:39p.m. CT on March 2. This car had crossed to Brownsville from Matamoros {{eighteen}} times between August 1992 and March 1993. When police {{went to the}} motel to check the register, they discovered that at 8:26p.m. CT that evening, Puentes Pizaña and Ramón Palomares, another hitman of the Cuellar organization, checked in with the receptionist. She registered the car in her notebook as a white Grand Marquis, but it was unclear if she wrote 821-WEX or 821-THE7 as the license plate number. Other evidence showed that several calls were made from Puentes Pizaña's and Garza's rooms to an identical Dallas number {{on the day of}} the murder. The police were never able to connect the number with the investigation, or identify the Dallas contact. Other evidence showed that Garza, along with Cuellar and Moya, visited a gun shop in Dallas to purchase a [...]38 Super pistol. After Fischer was killed, Garza said that the gun was stolen from his house in San Antonio after someone broke into it. The weapon was never recovered.|$|E

Even a few of the Govenlock residents tried their hand at bootlegging, but they soon found out that more of the liquor was stolen than they could actually sell. To avoid legal problems, bootleggers would have to obtain a tourist pass at Canada <b>border</b> <b>entry</b> points.|$|E
5000|$|Language: Citizens of {{countries}} which {{have more than}} one official language where one language is more prevalent than the other. The citizen of the minority language seeks assistance at an embassay of the citizen but is unable to obtain service immediately in their native language due to lack of personelle who speak the minority language. Same situation can apply at <b>border</b> <b>entry</b> ports where immigration staff do not have the language skills to speak to the citizen in their native tongue. Canada is a good example where this happens to Canadian citizens whose native language is French despite officially English and French having equal status.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1994 Israel-Jordan peace treaty, the Allenby Bridge Terminal is {{operated}} by the Israel Airports Authority. It serves as a border crossing between the West and East Banks of the Jordan River. The Jordanian authorities recognize the bridge as an international <b>border</b> <b>entry</b> point, but neither grant entry visas to foreign passport holders at this crossing, unlike the country's other border crossings with Israel, nor stamp the passports of departing travelers. Palestinians traveling abroad must use this bridge to exit the Palestinian Authority West Bank region into Jordan and then use the Queen Alia International Airport in Amman to fly abroad, {{because they are not}} permitted to use Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv. Travel permits from both Israeli and Jordanian authorities are required, with varied stringency depending on the political situation.|$|E
5000|$|All of the {{information}} received by sensors were meant to go to command centers, where a [...] "common operating picture" [...] would have been compiled by CBP and shared with other agencies. The common operating picture would have appeared on computer screens as a geospatial map, where <b>border</b> <b>entries</b> are tracked in real time.

They will then dispatch Border Patrol agents accordingly.|$|R
5000|$|While {{not part}} of {{traditional}} American cuisine, the consumption of monkey meat in the United States has become increasingly prevalent, predominantly due to the influx of African immigrants who see monkey meat and other bushmeats as [...] "home comfort". A 2007 report by The New York Times documented several instances of monkey meat being secretly imported into the United States {{under the guise of}} other meats. It is illegal to import bushmeat into the United States. Monkey meat found in the country's <b>border</b> <b>entries</b> will be seized and destroyed by border custom agents, along with any belongings that come with it. People may be fined US$250,000 for importing monkey meat.|$|R

He has a medical degree, specialising in obstetrics and gynecology, and had served as Deputy Prime Minister to Prime Minister Shukri Ghanem since 2003 at the time he was appointed to replace him. He was a part of Gaddafi's inner circle at least prior to his escape in mid-2011. He was arrested in Tunisia for illegal <b>border</b> <b>entry</b> and jailed for six months, although this was later overruled on appeal, however a Tunisian court decided to extradite Mahmoudi to Libya under a request from Libya's Transitional Council.|$|E
50|$|On {{the next}} day, Hezbollah swept areas around Tallat Mussa for any {{remaining}} pockets of rebels, as it entered {{the final stage}} of the offensive. Hezbollah clashed with militants at Jabal al-Barouh, while it took control of the Ras al-Marra-Arsal border-crossing, which was the last <b>border</b> <b>entry</b> into Qalamoun from Lebanon, as well as Dahr al-Hawa Hill, which overlooks Arsal and Younin. In addition, the SAA and NDF launched an attack on al-Nusra reinforcements coming from the Jubbah Heights. On the same day, ISIL and the al-Nusra Front engaged in fierce clashes along the Lebanese side of the border, after ISIL attempted to infiltrate al-Nusra positions in al-Zamarani and Wadi Ajram. ISIL's first attack wave around 5 P.M. was repelled by heavy artillery fire, but in the evening, ISIL launched a second attack that led to fierce fighting. The second attack was also eventually repelled, with ISIL fighters retreating to the north.|$|E
5000|$|Human {{smuggling}} is {{the movement}} of people from one country into another in exchange for monetary compensation. In this situation, both the smuggler and the person being smuggled are willingly participating in illegal <b>border</b> <b>entry</b> without proper documentation and are thus committing a crime against the country of entry. Both can be convicted of felony. However, human traffickers are committing crimes against the trafficked persons and use deception or threats to force the person into exploitative labor agreements. Only the trafficker can be convicted of felony; the trafficked person is not a criminal, but a victim. While human trafficking may, in some cases, involve smuggling the person across international borders, this is done against {{the will of the}} trafficked person through the use of threat, force, fraud, or any other kind of deception. [...] It is important to acknowledge that, while both human smuggling and human trafficking are prevalent in Texas, they are treated as two completely different criminal acts by the law.|$|E

5000|$|Oseguera Cervantes {{grew up in}} a poor {{family that}} {{cultivated}} avocados. He had five brothers: Juan, Miguel, Antonio, Marín, and Abraham. He dropped out of primary school in 5th grade to work in the fields. At the age of 14, however, started guarding marijuana plantations. A few years later, he decided he wanted a better life for himself and immigrated illegally to the U.S. state of California in the 1980s. To conceal his identity in the U.S., he used a different names and combinations, like [...] "Rubén Ávila", [...] "José López Prieto", [...] "Miguel Valadez", [...] "Carlos Hernández Mendoza", [...] "Roberto Salgado", among others. In 1986, he was living in the San Francisco Bay Area. He was arrested by the San Francisco Police at the age of 19 for stolen property and carrying a loaded gun. Two months after his arrest, his first child was born. According to <b>border</b> <b>entry</b> records, Oseguera Cervantes crossed the U.S.-Mexico border several times during the late 1980s under other aliases. The DEA and Mexican investigators believe that it was during this time that he became involved in meth production and trade in California's Central Valley alongside his brother-in-law Abigael González Valencia (alias [...] "El Cuini").|$|E

In China, age distribution and transmission dynamic characteristics were similar to those in Northern Hemisphere temperate countries. The epidemic was focused in children, with an effective reproduction number of ≈ 1. 2 – 1. 3. The 8 days of national holidays in October reduced the effective reproduction number by 37 % (95 % credible interval 28 %– 45 %) and increased underreporting by ≈ 20 %– 30 %. <b>Border</b> <b>entry</b> screening detected at most 37 % of international travel–related cases, with most (89 %) persons identifi ed as having fever at time of entry.
