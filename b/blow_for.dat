5|$|Feeling that a {{complete}} {{destruction of the}} GUNT would be an intolerable <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> his prestige, and fearing that Habré would provide support for all opposition to Gaddafi, the Colonel called for a Libyan intervention in force, as his Chadian allies could not secure a definitive victory without Libyan armor and airpower.|$|E
5|$|Amnesty International {{called the}} {{conviction}} “a bitter <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> freedom of expression”. Hugh Williamson, of Human Rights Watch, {{stated that the}} “charges and verdict … distort both {{the facts and the}} law.... These women should never have been charged with a hate crime and should be released immediately.” ARTICLE 19, Freedom House, and the International Federation for Human Rights also issued statements condemning the sentence. On September 21, 2012, the Feminist Press published an e-book entitled Pussy Riot! A Punk Prayer for Freedom to raise funds for the legal defense team.|$|E
5|$|Pierce v. Society of Sisters was a 1925 {{decision}} by the Taft Court striking down an Oregon law banning private schools. In a decision written by Justice James C. McReynolds, a unanimous court held that Oregon could regulate private schools, but could not eliminate them. The outcome supported the right of parents to control the education of their children, but also, since the lead plaintiff (the society) ran Catholic schools, struck a <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> religious freedom.|$|E

5|$|Proximity of the {{peninsula}} to the Gulf Stream leads to unusually high temperatures in winter, resulting in significant temperature variations between land and the Barents Sea and in fluctuating temperatures during high winds. Cyclones are typical during the cold seasons, while the warm seasons are characterized by anticyclones. Monsoon winds are common in most areas, with south and southwesterly winds prevailing in winter months and with somewhat more pronounced easterly winds in summer. Strong storm winds <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> 80–120days a year. The waters of the Murman Coast remain warm enough to remain ice-free even in winter.|$|E
5|$|The Inchon {{landings}} were {{a crushing}} <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> the North Korean Army, catching it completely unprepared and breaking the already weak forces along the perimeter. With virtually no equipment, exhausted manpower and low morale, the North Koreans {{were at a}} severe disadvantage and {{were not able to}} continue to pressure on the Pusan Perimeter while attempting to repel the landings at Inchon. By September 23, the North Koreans were in full retreat from the Pusan Perimeter, with UN forces rapidly pursuing them north and recapturing lost ground along the way.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} a <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> the French {{defenders}} of Martinique, who were isolated from France and suffering from shortages {{of military and}} food supplies. Although another supply frigate broke through the blockade and arrived in December 1808, the island was surrounded by British bases and was invaded and captured in January 1809. Other French colonies were seized {{over the next two}} years as the blockade cut off French communications with their overseas territories. Amethyst and her captain Michael Seymour were active in this campaign, capturing a second French frigate, Niémen, at the Action of 6 April 1809.|$|E

5|$|The {{conquest of}} Amorium {{was not only}} a major {{military}} disaster and a heavy personal <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> Theophilos, but also a traumatic event for the Byzantines, its impact resonating in later literature. The sack did not ultimately alter the balance of power, which was slowly shifting in Byzantium's favour, but it thoroughly discredited the theological doctrine of Iconoclasm, ardently supported by Theophilos. As Iconoclasm relied heavily on military success for its legitimization, the fall of Amorium contributed decisively to its abandonment shortly after Theophilos's death in 842.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} Inchon landings were {{a crushing}} <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> the North Korean army, catching them completely unprepared and breaking the already-weak forces along the perimeter.

5|$|With matters {{now turned}} to actual bowling, Lindwall's {{classical}} bowling action evoked as much public interest as his captain's batting. In a match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge he took 6/14, {{to gain a}} psychological <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> the forthcoming Test at the same venue. Three of his victims were castled by his yorker. In the following match he twice skittled Sussex with match figures of 11/59, five of whom were bowled by yorkers, as the hosts were bowled out for 86 and 138 respectively.|$|E

5|$|On August 16 the Swedes {{arrived at}} Helsingør, took {{shelter in the}} city and started bombarding the castle with artillery. The Danes {{returned}} the fire, attempting to set the city on fire. They managed to destroy a dozen houses, but the fire did not spread enough to cause a conflagration. Danish artillery rained continually on the Swedish soldiers. However, the Swedish force still managed to advance, taking the outer line of defenses. The mood in the castle darkened, and Beenfeldt's courage wavered. The Swedish commander Karl Gustav Wrangel resorted to subterfuge and spread the rumor that Copenhagen had fallen and the Swedish soldiers started a false celebration. Discouraged and demoralized, the Danes capitulated. The loss of Kronborg was a <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> the Danish; 77 captured cannons were quickly put to use in the siege and with the castle in Swedish hands, it was believed that the Dutch would have a difficult time to come to aid.|$|E
5|$|The King's {{capitulation}} {{was a hard}} <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> Kościuszko, who had {{not lost}} a single battle in the campaign. By mid-September 1792 he was resigned to leaving the country, and in early October he departed from Warsaw. First he went east, to the Czartoryski family manor at Sieniawa, which gathered various malcontents. In mid-November he spent two weeks in Lwów (in Ukrainian, Lviv; in German, Lemberg), where he was welcomed by the populace; since the war's end, his presence had drawn crowds eager to see the famed commander. Izabela Czartoryska discussed having him marry her daughter Zofia. The Russians planned to arrest him if he returned to territory under their control; the Austrians, who held Lwów, offered him a commission in the Austrian Army, which he turned down. Subsequently they planned to deport him, but he left Lwów before they could do so. At {{the turn of the}} month, he stopped in Zamość at the Zamoyskis' estate, met Stanisław Staszic, then went on to Puławy.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Kronan {{was a hard}} <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> Sweden {{during the}} Scanian War. Besides being {{the largest and most}} heavily armed ship in the Swedish Navy, she had been an {{important}} status symbol for the monarchy of the young Charles XI. Along with Kronan, the navy lost a sizeable proportion of its best manpower, acting supreme commander Lorentz Creutz, numerous high-ranking fleet officers, and the chief of the navy medical staff. A commission was set up to investigate whether any individuals could be held responsible for the Swedish fiasco at the Battle of Öland and other major defeats during the war. Although no one was officially held accountable, Creutz has been blamed by many historians for the sinking of Kronan because of his naval and command inexperience. Recent research has provided a more nuanced picture, and points to Sweden's general lack of a well-developed naval organization and officer corps at the time.|$|E

5|$|The ousting of {{the merchants}} from Constantinople {{was a heavy}} <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> Bulgarian {{economic}} interests. The merchants complained to Simeon I, who in turn raised the issue to Leo VI, but the appeal was left unanswered. Simeon, who according to the Byzantine chroniclers was seeking a pretext to declare war and to implement his plans to seize the Byzantine throne, attacked, provoking what has sometimes been called (inappropriately) the first commercial war in Europe. However, many historians including Vasil Zlatarski and John Fine consider those claims unlikely, arguing that {{in the beginning of}} his reign Simeon needed to consolidate his power and imperial ambitions had not yet been crystallised, therefore his military intervention was a defensive act to protect the Bulgarian commercial interests.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} {{at the foot of}} the settlement, Eric besieged and attacked the city, but was repelled. Led by duke Višeslav, the inhabitants of Trsat threw spears, shot arrows, and hurled huge stones on the enemy, and managed to kill many of them. Eric's forces fled their positions, and were subsequently routed by the forces of Višeslav in an ambush. Eric was among those killed, and his death and defeat proved to be a great <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> the Carolingian Empire. Aquileian Patriarch Saint Paulinus II cursed the land in which the hero was killed, and wrote Carmen de regula fidei, the rhythmus or elegy for his death.|$|E
5|$|After his victory, Basil II {{advanced}} towards Strumitsa, {{which was}} key to holding the whole Vardar valley. On {{their way to}} the city, the Byzantines seized the Matsukion fortress to the east of their advance. The Byzantine Emperor also sent an army under Botaneiates to surround Strumitsa and destroy all ramparts to the south and clear the passage to Thessalonica. With the remainder of his troops, Basil laid siege to the city itself. The Bulgarians allowed Botaneiates to destroy the fortifications, but he and his army were ambushed by Bulgarian raiders in a narrow valley, soon after their task was complete. In the ensuing battle Botaneiates was completely defeated and the Bulgarian commander Gabriel Radomir personally stabbed Botaneiates with his spear. As a result, Basil II was forced to abandon the siege of Strumitsa and retreat. On the return, the eloquence of the cubicularius Sergius convinced the defenders of Melnik to surrender, another heavy <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> the Bulgarians as the town guarded the main road to Sofia from the south.|$|E

5|$|John's {{situation}} {{began to}} deteriorate rapidly. The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin {{authority in the}} south had been undermined by Richard's giving away of various key castles some years before. His use of routier mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly eaten away his remaining support in this area too, which {{set the stage for}} a sudden collapse of Angevin power. John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard. In March 1204, Gaillard fell. John's mother Eleanor died the following month. This was not just a personal <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> John, but threatened to unravel the widespread Angevin alliances across the far south of France. Philip moved south around the new defensive line and struck upwards at the heart of the Duchy, now facing little resistance. By August, Philip had taken Normandy and advanced south to occupy Anjou and Poitou as well. John's only remaining possession on the Continent was now the Duchy of Aquitaine.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat and}} death of Richard III at Bosworth field was a double <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> the heralds, for they lost both their patron, the King, and their benefactor, the Earl Marshal, who was also slain. The victorious Henry Tudor was crowned King Henry VII soon after the battle. Henry's first Parliament of 1485 passed an Act of Resumption, in which large grants of crown {{properties}} made by his two predecessors to their supporters were cancelled. Whether this act affected {{the status of the}} College's charter is debatable; however, the act did facilitate the de facto recovery of Coldharbour to the crown. Henry then granted the house to his mother Lady Margaret Beaufort, for life. This was because it was supposed that the house was granted personally to John Writhe the Garter King of Arms and not to the heralds as a corporation. As a result, the heralds were left destitute and many of their books and records were lost. Despite this ill treatment from the King, the heralds' position at the royal court remained, and they were compelled by the King to attend him at all times (albeit in rotation).|$|E
5|$|The main {{advantage}} the HBC {{had over}} the Americans was that it could take such losses. As a vast corporation with {{a large amount of}} capital, the company was able to undersell the Americans, taking a loss, for years on end. By the middle to late 1830s the HBC policy on the coast was to pay whatever price necessary to ensure that furs fell into their hands and not the Americans. American traders soon found the coast fur trade unprofitable—the HBC had captured the trade. But Americans still traded with the Russians at Sitka and, once on the coast were wont to seek a few furs. As long as this continued, the HBC continued to have to pay high prices for furs and take losses. Eventually the Sitka trade became financially risky. The American-Russian agreement of 1824, which allowed Americans to trade in the Alaska Panhandle, expired in 1834 and was not renewed. In 1839 the HBC made an agreement with the Russian American Company (RAC), under which the HBC would supply the RAC with provisions and manufactures in exchange for a ten-year lease for portions of the Alaska Panhandle. This proved to be the final <b>blow</b> <b>for</b> the American traders, who were finally driven out of the North West Coast maritime fur trade altogether.|$|E
