50|$|A {{complex set}} of {{engineering}} and scientific challenges in the food and <b>bioprocessing</b> <b>industry</b> for manufacturing high quality and safe food through efficient and sustainable means can be solved through nanotechnology. Bacteria identification and food quality monitoring using biosensors; intelligent, active, and smart food packaging systems; nanoencapsulation of bioactive food compounds are few examples of emerging applications of nanotechnology for the food industry. Nanotechnology can be applied in the production, processing, safety and packaging of food. A nanocomposite coating process could improve food packaging by placing anti-microbial agents directly {{on the surface of}} the coated film.Nanocomposites could increase or decrease gas permeability of different fillers as is needed for different products. They can also improve the mechanical and heat-resistance properties and lower the oxygen transmission rate. Research is being performed to apply nanotechnology to the detection of chemical and biological substances for sensanges in foods.|$|E

Process economics, safety, environmental impact, and product quality are considered. This study investigated which skills and conceptual knowledge related to bioprocessing design were most important for entry-level engineers in the <b>bioprocessing</b> <b>industry.</b> A survey was created to examine which unit operations, technical skills, and professional skills were important based on the ratings of engineers with at least 2 {{years of experience in}} the bioprocessing and bioprocess consulting industries.

40|$|The <b>Bioprocessing</b> <b>industry</b> {{delivers}} high-value protein-based {{pharmaceutical products}} produced using microbial or animal cells. Animal cell culture, the only method currently {{available for the}} production of proteins with human-like post-translational modifications, is an expensive and labor-intensive process, as animal cells have complex nutrient requirements. Optimization studies have typically been limited to experimental studies, although there has recently been increased interest in combined experimental and computational approaches. In this work, we present the results of a dynamic optimization approach to improving animal cell bioprocesses. We have based this on a model validated over batch and fed-batch conditions and have examined four possible objective functions. Our results indicate that the maximization of the product concentration or the integral of viable cell concentration over time give equivalent results and can improve the product titer up to 70 % over non-optimized fed-batch cultures...|$|E

This article presents an empirical test of workforce intermediation through a study of community colleges in North Carolina. It demonstrates the positive contribution of intermediary colleges in increasing access to jobs in the pharmaceutical and <b>bioprocessing</b> <b>industries.</b> It also considers the limits of this strategy when adopted by only a subset of colleges within a larger labor market region and, specifically, the challenges this creates for forging strong relationships with employers outside the jurisdictional boundaries of individual colleges. The authors conclude by considering policy options for extending the reach of intermediation across the regional labor market through greater intercollege coordination. The authors argue that coordination efforts in North Carolina, although still in their infancy, hold considerable promise for other college systems that are looking to position themselves as institutional leaders in intermediation. workforce intermediation; biomanufacturing; community colleges; North Carolina; regional coordination...|$|R

Nanotechnology contains the synthesis, characterization, and application of devices and materials whose smallest organization {{in at least one}} dimension is on a scale of less than 100 nm [1 – 3].

30|$|Engineering {{multi-domain}} {{enzymes that}} {{are capable of}} catalyzing two or more reactions is a potential strategy to reduce enzyme costs in bio-industrial processes, as multiple catalytic properties on a single polypeptide conceivably simplify production and purification operations of biochemicals (Ribeiro et al. 2011). Similarly, the cost-effective optimization of chimeras to prevent unproductive competition between functionally similar enzymes by testing the importance of both the positions of enzymes and CBMs for an efficient use in <b>bioprocessing</b> <b>industries</b> is necessary, though demanding a vigorous investigation. However, the successful expression of the essential cellulolytic enzymes (i.e., endoglucanases, exoglucanases, and β-glucosidases) on a single peptide chain, in a processive order, such that their proportionate quantities favor maximum hydrolysis efficiency has been highly challenging (Tozakidis et al. 2016). Also, the determination of simple and reliable structural organization of the chimeric domains has been a significant drawback in the construction of a protein chimera, but the advent of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) with flexible analytical models (e.g., molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo simulations) has provided not only successful computational data validation approaches, but also accurate fitting of the scattering profile due to their potential to explore the protein conformation in space (Cota et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|The use of in-situ near {{infrared}} spectroscopy (NIRS) {{as a tool}} for monitoring four key analytes in a CHO-K 1 animal cell culture was investigated. Previous work using on-line NIRS to monitor bioprocesses has involved its application ex-situ where the analyzer is physically outside the fermentor, or to microbial bioprocesses. This novel application of NIRS to monitor analytes within an animal cell culture using a steam sterilizable in-situ fiber optic probe is very important for furthering the use of NIRS within the <b>bioprocessing</b> <b>industry.</b> The method of calibration used to develop the models involved the use of large data sets so that all likely variation in stoichiometry was incorporated within the models. Successful models for glucose, lactate, glutamine, and ammonia were built with Standard Error of Predictions (SEP's) of 0. 072 (g/L), 0. 0144 (g/L), 0. 308 (mM), and 0. 036 (mM), respectively of the total concentration range...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of Near Infrared Spectroscopy has paralleled {{that of the}} PC, {{and the application of}} NIR in many industries has undergone explosive growth in recent years. This has been particularly apparent in the area of microbial and cell culture system monitoring and control. Potentially, NIR offers the prospect of real-time control of the physiology of cultured cells in fermenters, leading to marked improvements in authenticity, purity and production efficiency. Despite this, NIR is not yet as widely applied within the <b>bioprocessing</b> <b>industry</b> as its potential might suggest. This review critically evaluates the {{development of}} this rapidly moving area as it pertains to microbial and cell culture system control and highlights the critical stages {{in the development of the}} technology. It indicates the work that must still be carried out if the full potential of NIR is to be exploited in making proteins, hormones and antibiotics by the fermentation route. The review comes at a particularly timely moment when NIR stands on the threshold of widespread acceptance in bioprocessing.

40|$|The marine <b>bioprocessing</b> <b>industry</b> offers great {{potential}} to utilize byproducts for fish meal replacement in aquafeeds. Jumbo squid {{is an important}} fishery commodity in Mexico, but only the mantle is marketed. Head, fins, guts and tentacles are discarded in spite of being protein-rich byproducts. This study evaluated the use of two jumbo squid byproduct hydrolysates obtained by acid-enzymatic hydrolysis (AEH) and by autohydrolysis (AH) as ingredients in practical diets for shrimp. The hydrolysates were included at levels of 2. 5 and 5. 0 % of the diet dry weight in four practical diets, including a control diet without hydrolysate. Shrimp growth and survival were not significantly affected by the dietary treatments. Postharvest quality of abdominal muscle was evaluated in terms of proximate composition and sensory evaluation. Significantly higher crude protein was observed in the muscle of shrimp fed the highest hydrolysate levels, AH 5 % (204. 8 g kg- 1) or AEH 5 % (201. 3 g kg- 1). Sensory analysis of cooked muscle showed significant differences for all variables evaluated: color, odor, flavor, and firmness. It was concluded that Jumbo squid byproducts can be successfully processed by autohydrolysis or acid-enzymatic hydrolysis, and that up to 5. 0 % of the hydrolysates {{can be incorporated into}} shrimp diets without affecting growth or survival...|$|E

Recently, cold gelation ability of whey protein isolate (WPI) is taking interest in protection and delivery of value-added bioactive compounds through micro and nano-association techniques. This study aims to combine an electro-heating treatment at moderate electric fields (MEF) together with cold gelation ability of whey proteins in order to reduce size of protein aggregates at nano-scale and improve association efficiency of riboflavin. Divalent iron cation assisted cold gelation of electro-heated WPI and effects of MEF on the produced hydrogels were reported and encouraged during this experimental research. Particle size was characterized, through dynamic light scattering. While spectrofluorimetric analyses were performed in order to examine the effects of MEF and cold induced gelation on the association of riboflavin within WPI hydrogel network structure. Under MEF application smaller sized particles were produced and riboflavin association efficiencies ranged from 40 to 60 %. Results also show that MEF treatment allowed producing WPI nano-hydrogels with associated riboflavin less susceptible to light oxidation. This novel approach that combines electro-heating treatment together with cold gelation can be used to design and develop entirely biodegradable whey protein-based gels as potential devices for controlled release of riboflavin. MEF can be used to improve or create novel applications not only in food and <b>bioprocessing</b> <b>industries,</b> but also in the pharmaceutical area...|$|R
40|$|Sorghum is an {{important}} grain exploited {{for a wide variety}} of uses in the food, animal feed and <b>bioprocessing</b> <b>industries.</b> In this study the chemical composition of the seed starch, protein, fat and fibre content, and also phenotypic traits including gelatinisation temperature, peak viscosity, breakdown and setback were investigated in 55 accessions from the USDA-ARS germplasm collection. This study also used a sequencing approach to detect DNA base changes in the three important starch synthesis genes; soluble starch synthase (SSIIa), granule bound starch synthase (GBSS) and starch branching enzyme (SBEIIb) in the 55 accessions. It investigated whether there is a genetic basis to different phenotypic traits such as gelatinization temperature in sorghum. Tassel software was utilised to merge the genotypic and phenotypic data, form statistical association for the dissection of complex genetic traits, and attempt to find QTLs. Our results found a wide variation for all parameters measured and in all genes studied. Of particular interest were three SNPs in the SSIIa gene which could distinguish four distinct sorghum haplotypes, which also had significant differences in the relative composition of starch, fat, fibre and protein in the seed. Haplotypes 1 and 2 had low gelatinisation temperature of 80. 7 oC and 83. 7 oC, respectively, whilst Haplotypes 3 and 4 had significantly higher gelatinisation temperature of 92. 8 oC and 88. 8 oC respectively.

40|$|The {{domain of}} <b>bioprocessing</b> and <b>industry</b> of {{biotechnology}} is evolving. Remarkable progress in recent time has already brought the industry into {{a stage of}} growth. As a result of this, many biotechnological products, foods, and agricultural products are being commercialized. Therefore, there is a transition from research {{work in the laboratory}} to the market. In this consequence, bioprocess engineering covers the area from development to the actual production. Different parts of the discipline are being studied and still going on in order to make revenue. Thus, the revenue is concerned, it is important to identify critical phases, uncertain variables involved in those phases, and degree of sensitivity of those uncertain variables. Identifying those variables that plays vital role in production cost makes the decision makers tasks easier. When the key variables have been determined, then the decision makers know where to focus more and analyze further. In this thesis, we have developed a tool from an existing software platform called Bioptima planner to analyze and identify different sources of uncertainty, uncertain variables, and their level of uncertainty and sensitivity regarding the final production cost. When significant uncertain variables whose impacts are bigger in the cost have been determined, then the decision makers’ tasks become obvious to analyze those variables and leave the less important ones. A case study i. e. Probiotic example is used to demonstrate the applicability of the tool. It produces graphical representation of the results using histogram, tornado diagram, and violin plot which serves our purpose of decision making in the context of sensitivity analysis. Significant differences in sensitivities were found among the variables due to different properties of them and the probability distributions applied to them...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{temperature}} shift cultivation to enhance recombinant protein yield is widely utilised in the <b>bioprocessing</b> <b>industry.</b> The responses of mammalian cells to heat stress are well characterized; however, the equivalent cold stress responses are not. In particular, the transcriptional mechanisms that lead to enhanced gene-specific expression upon cold stress {{have yet to be}} elucidated. We report here in silico and experimental identification and characterization of transcriptional control elements that regulate cold inducible RNA-binding (CIRP) gene expression and demonstrate these can be used for enhanced transgene expression. In silico analysis identified the core CIRP promoter and a number of conserved transcription factor-binding sites across mammalian species. The core promoter was confirmed by experimental studies that located the basal transcriptional regulatory elements of CIRP within 264 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site. Deletion analysis of a fragment from - 264 to - 64 that contained two putative CAAT-binding sites abolished promoter activity. A second promoter was identified in the region - 452 to - 264 of the transcription start site which was able to drive transcription independent of the core promoter. As the two CIRP promoters were transcriptionally active and possibly cold responsive, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays to show that both promoter regions are able to bind factors within a nuclear extract in a dose-dependent manner and that the formation of these complexes was specific to the promoter regions. Finally, we successfully demonstrate using a reporter gene approach that enhanced transgene expression can be achieved using the identified CIRP promoter...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{glycosylation}} of recombinant proteins can {{be altered}} by a range of parameters including cellular metabolism, metabolic flux and {{the efficiency of the}} glycosylation process. We present an experimental set-up that allows determination of these key processes associated with the control of N -linked glycosylation of recombinant proteins. Results Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) were cultivated in shake flasks at 0 mM glutamine and displayed a reduced growth rate, glucose metabolism and a slower decrease in pH, when compared to other glutamine-supplemented cultures. The N -linked glycosylation of recombinant human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) was also altered under these conditions; the sialylation, fucosylation and antennarity decreased, while the proportion of neutral structures increased. A continuous culture set-up was subsequently used to understand the control of HCG glycosylation in the presence of varied glutamine concentrations; when glycolytic flux was reduced in the absence of glutamine, the glycosylation changes that were observed in shake flask culture were similarly detected. The intracellular content of UDP-GlcNAc was also reduced, which correlated with a decrease in sialylation and antennarity of the N -linked glycans attached to HCG. Conclusions The use of metabolic flux analysis illustrated a case of steady state multiplicity, where use of the same operating conditions at each steady state resulted in altered flux through glycolysis and the TCA cycle.

40|$|Identification {{and use of}} more {{efficient}} enzymes in the food and pharmaceutical industries {{is the focus of}} many researchers. The aim {{of this study was to}} search for a new bacterial strain capable of producing high levels of pullulanase applicable to biotechnology, the starch <b>bioprocessing</b> and food <b>industries.</b> A new pullulan hydrolyzing Bacillus strain was isolated and designated SDK 2. Morphological and biochemical tests identified the strain as a putative Bacillus cereus strain, which was further characterized and confirmed through 16 s rRNA sequencing, and was submitted to GeneBank, under the accession number FR 6864500. Quantative analysis of the strain’s pullulanase activity was carried out by the Dintrosalicyclic (DNS) acid-based assay. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) of the culture supernatant, identified the extracellular pullulanase as neopullulanase. Effects of temperature and pH on pullulanase activity were also studied. The optimum conditions for enzyme activity, as represented by 60 o C and a pH of 7, resulted in an activity of 13. 43 U/ml, which is much higher than some of the previously reported activities. However, growth of B. cereus SDK 2 was also observed at a pH range of 5 to 10, and temperatures of 30 o C to 50 o C. The effect of metal ions and reagents, such as Mg + 2, Ca + 2, Zn + 2, Cu + 2, Fe + 2, Ni + 2 on enzyme activity showed that Ca + 2 ions increased pullulan activity, whereas the other ions and reagents inhibited pullulanase activity. The ability of B. cereus SDK 2 to produce high levels of neopullulanase stable at 60 o C that can generate panose from pullulan, make this newly isolated strain a valuable source of debranching enzyme for biotechnology, the starch bioprocess and medical industries. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} improvement in bioprocessing strategy could be achieved from a step-change in bioprocess monitoring and control. Traditionally, many fermentation products have come from microbial bioprocesses; today, however, both mammalian and insect cells are engineered for the manufacture of high-cost products. With an increased shift from microbial to mammalian cell cultivation, {{it is important to}} exploit novel ways to monitor these processes in order to optimise production efficiency. In its Process Analytical Technology (PAT) initiative, the US FDA outlined a system for designing, analysing and controlling manufacturing through timely measurements of critical quality and performance attributes of raw and in-process materials, with the goal of ensuring final product quality (1). This has led many pharma companies to re-evaluate their requirements for bioprocess analysis. The PAT initiative encourages the development of improved process monitoring technology in the manufacturing environment. This has effectively stimulated the investigation of a number of novel technologies in a biomanufacturing context, and much attention has been focused on Mid Infrared and Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). The use of NIRS in the <b>bioprocessing</b> <b>industry</b> has grown rapidly in the last 10 years. Advances in instrumentation and chemometric techniques have contributed to this growth, together with an increased realisation that NIRS {{can be used in a}} wide range of bioprocesses with very diverse conditions. NIRS potentially offers simultaneous analysis of several components quickly, with no sample pre-treatment, and has the capability to be used in situ giving information in real-time (2). This has obvious advantages for process optimisation and control. In the study presented in this article, we monitor a stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line grown in a fermenter using in situ NIR to understand the process growth characteristics and also optimise productivity – with the final aim being scale up of the developed models. Potentially, implementation of real-time NIR monitoring offers two prospects: 1) linking processing factors to Critical to Quality (CtQ) product characteristics; and 2) defining real-time process signatures using a combination of whole spectrum processing and multivariate data analysis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Novel {{analytical}} tools, which {{shorten the}} long and costly development cycles of biopharmaceuticals are essential. Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) shows great promise in improving {{our understanding of the}} metabolism of cell factories in bioreactors, but currently only provides information post-process using conventional off-line methods. MFA combined with real time multianalyte process monitoring techniques provides a valuable platform technology allowing real time insights into metabolic responses of cell factories in bioreactors. This could have a major impact in the <b>bioprocessing</b> <b>industry,</b> ultimately improving product consistency, productivity and shortening development cycles. Results: This is the first investigation using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) in situ combined with metabolic flux modelling which is both a significant challenge and considerable extension of these techniques. We investigated the feasibility of our approach using the industrial workhorse Pichia pastoris in a simplified model system. A parental P. pastoris strain (i. e. which does not synthesize recombinant protein) was used to allow definition of distinct metabolic states focusing solely upon the prediction of intracellular fluxes in central carbon metabolism. Extracellular fluxes were determined using off-line conventional reference methods and on-line NIR predictions (calculated by multivariate analysis using the partial least squares algorithm, PLS). The results showed that the PLS-NIRS models for biomass and glycerol were accurate: correlation coefficients, R 2, above 0. 90 and the root mean square error of prediction, RMSEP, of 1. 17 and 2. 90 g/L, respectively. The analytical quality of the NIR models was demonstrated by direct comparison with the standard error of the laboratory (SEL), which showed that performance of the NIR models was suitable for quantifying biomass and glycerol for calculating extracellular metabolite rates and used as independent inputs for the MFA (RMSEP lower than 1. 5 × SEL). Furthermore, the results for the MFA from both datasets passed consistency tests performed for each steady state, showing that the precision of on-line NIRS is equivalent to that obtained by the off-line measurements. Conclusions: The findings of this study show {{for the first time the}} potential of NIRS as an input generating for MFA models, contributing to the optimization of cell factory metabolism in real-time...|$|E
40|$|Filamentous fungi of genus Aspergillus {{represent}} a good assortment of microbes having enormous {{value in the}} <b>bioprocessing</b> <b>industry</b> and those demonstrating pathogenic activity in either plants [3] or people [4]. Fungal cell wall proteins (CWPs) protect the cell against stressful conditions in a fermenter [1], control branching [2, 3] and are promising antifungal drug targets [4]. To this end the broad goal of my research is to develop novel proteomic strategies to identify and quantify change in expression of proteins that play a formidable role in cell wall development and repair. To begin with we developed a procedure to extract cell wall proteins from isolated cell walls and identify them using shotgun proteomic workflows consisting of reverse phase liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In order to isolate cell walls we used sophisticated washing steps followed by two different approaches to extract CWPs from isolated cell walls which were then subjected to shotgun proteomics. Overall 34 nominal cell wall proteins were identified including proteins essential for cell wall integrity signaling (CWIS) and each step of cell wall biosynthesis. Next we established a tool to quantify changes in cell wall protein expression compatible with shotgun proteomic workflow using Deuterium Isobaric Amine Reactive Tag (DiART) reagents. DiART represents cost-effective isobaric tagging reagents due to incorporation of deuterium isotopes. We corroborated the feasibility of performing protein quantitation on a LTQ mass spectrometer using quantitative data obtained from DiART tagged synthetic peptides, model protein mixtures and complex cell wall proteins. Subsequently we proved the applicability of DiART for quantitative phosphoproteomic workflows using DiART tagged phosphopeptides subjected to affinity enrichment using TiO 2 resins. Finally we focused our efforts on characterization of phosphorylation mediated regulatory networks in A. nidulans which would be valuable for overall fungal research. Using a bottom-up phosphoproteomic workflow and a state-of-the-art mass spectrometer Q-Exactive, we identified 1637 unique phosphopeptides from 647 phosphoproteins. Functional classification and kinase-substrate analysis collectively revealed clear association of the phosphoproteome and cellular events essential for fungal morphology and secretion. Overall our methodology {{could be used to}} quantify changes in cell wall protein expression and phosphorylation, both of which are inherently observed in CWIS...|$|E
