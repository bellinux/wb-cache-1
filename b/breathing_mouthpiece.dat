Lifestyle changes may include avoiding alcohol, losing weight, stopping smoking, and sleeping on one's side. Breathing devices {{include the use}} of a CPAP machine.

50|$|Rebreather Courses: A rebreather is a {{breathing}} apparatus {{consisting of a}} <b>breathing</b> loop, a <b>mouthpiece,</b> a CO2 absorbent canister, and a counterlung. There are three types of rebreathers: Oxygen rebreathers, semi-closed rebreathers and closed circuit rebreathers. While rebreathers allow for a greater efficiency of gas use, optimized decompression characteristics and quieter operation, divers must be properly trained in this equipment before their use. TDI offers the courses below to help divers who wish to start using rebreathers.|$|R
50|$|The diver {{breathes}} {{from the}} rebreather circuit through a bite-grip mouthpiece or an oro-nasal mask {{which may be}} part of a full-face mask or diving helmet.The mouthpiece is connected {{to the rest of the}} rebreather by <b>breathing</b> hoses. The <b>mouthpiece</b> of a diving rebreather will usually include a shutoff valve, and may incorporate a dive/surface valve or a bailout valve or both. On loop configured rebreathers the mouthpiece is usually the place where the non-return valves for the loop are fitted.|$|R
25|$|The {{demand valve}} has a chamber, which in normal use {{contains}} breathing gas at ambient pressure. A valve which supplies medium pressure gas can vent into the chamber. Either a mouthpiece or a full-face mask {{is connected to}} the chamber for the diver to <b>breathe</b> from. The <b>mouthpiece</b> can be direct coupled or connected by a flexible low-pressure hose. On one side of the chamber is a flexible diaphragm to control the operation of the valve. The diaphragm is protected by a cover with holes or slits through which outside water can enter freely.|$|R
2500|$|Ideally the {{delivered}} {{pressure is}} equal to the resting pressure in the diver's lungs as this is what human lungs are adapted to breathe. With a twin hose regulator behind the diver at shoulder level, the delivered pressure changes with diver orientation. if the diver rolls on his or her back the released air pressure is higher than in the lungs. Divers learned to restrict flow by using their tongue to close the mouthpiece. When the cylinder pressure was running low and air demand effort rising, a roll to the right side made <b>breathing</b> easier. The <b>mouthpiece</b> can be purged by lifting it above [...] the regulator(shallower), which will cause a free flow.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the resistance to breathing in metabolic systems used for the distribution and measurement of pulmonary gas exchange. A mechanical lung simulator was used to standardize selected air flow rates (V·, L/s). The delta pressure (?p, Pa) between the ambient air and the air inside the equipment was measured in the <b>breathing</b> valve?s <b>mouthpiece</b> adapter for four metabolic systems and four types of breathing valves. Resistance for the inspiratory and expiratory sides was calculated as RES?=?(?p/V·) ?Pa/L/s. The results for resistance showed significant (p?<? 0. 05) between-group variance among the tested metabolic systems, breathing valves, and between most of the completed V·. The lowest resistance among the metabolic systems was found for a Douglas Bag system which had approximately half of the resistance compared to the automated metabolic systems. The automated systems were found to have higher resistance even at low V· in comparison with previous findings and recommendations. For the hardware components, the highest resistance was found for the breathing valves, while the lowest resistance was found for the hoses. The results showed that resistance in metabolic systems can be minimized through conscious choices of system design and hardware components...|$|R

50|$|Although {{there are}} several design {{variations}} of diving rebreather, all types have a gas-tight loop that the diver inhales from and exhales into. The loop consists of several components sealed together. The diver <b>breathes</b> through a <b>mouthpiece</b> or a fullface mask. This is connected {{to one or more}} tubes ducting inhaled and exhaled gas between the diver and a counterlung or breathing bag. This holds gas when it is not in the diver's lungs. The loop also includes a scrubber containing carbon dioxide absorbent to remove the carbon dioxide exhaled by the diver. Attached to the loop there will be at least one valve allowing addition of gases, such as oxygen and perhaps a diluting gas, from a gas storage into the loop. There may be valves allowing venting of gas from the loop.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND—Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) have {{a number}} of upper airway {{structural}} abnormalities which may influence the resistance of the oral airway to airflow. There have been no systematic studies of the flow dynamics of the oral cavity in such patients.  METHODS—Inspiratory oral airway resistance to airflow (RO) was measured in 13 awake patients with OSA in both the upright and supine positions (neck position constant). Each subject <b>breathed</b> via a <b>mouthpiece</b> while the nasal airway was occluded with a nasal mask.  RESULTS—In the upright position the mean (SE) RO was 1. 26 (0. 19) cm H 2 O/l/s (at 0. 4 l/s) which increased to 2. 01 (0. 43) cm H 2 O/l/s when supine (p< 0. 05, paired t test). The magnitude of this change correlated negatively with the respiratory disturbance index (r= - 0. 60, p = 0. 03).  CONCLUSION—In awake patients with OSA RO is normal when upright but abnormally raised when in the supine position. ...|$|R

Therefore, unpleasant somatic experiences are expected be remembered as less aversive when they end gradually rather than abruptly, even when they last longer (i. e., the "peak-end effect"). We investigated the peak-end effect for dyspnea in healthy participants and in patients with medically unexplained dyspnea (MUD). MethodsTwo aversive dyspnea-inducing tasks were administered to a clinical MUD sample (n = 29) and a matched healthy control group (n = 29) using a rebreathing paradigm (60 -second room air, 150 -second rebreathing). In a short trial, the <b>breathing</b> system (<b>mouthpiece)</b> was removed immediately after peak dyspnea. In a long trial, breathing was switched to room air after peak dyspnea and continued in the breathing system for 150 seconds (order was counterbalanced across participants). Respiratory parameters were continuously measured, and dyspnea was rated every 10 seconds. Relative unpleasantness of the dyspneic episode was assessed with forced choice questions. ResultsMore than 70 % of the healthy group found the short episode worse than the long one despite equal maximal dyspnea (p =. 02). Patients with MUD did not show this peak-end effect (p =. 58). The latter had deficient recovery of dyspnea compared with the controls (42. 08 [21. 86] versus 17. 51 [11. 18], p <. 001), {{which could not be}} explained by differences in respiratory physiology. ConclusionsThe peak-end effect in dyspnea has important implications for dyspnea measurement. Its absence in patients with MUD suggests a critical role of distorted perceptual-cognitive processing of aversive somatic sensations in patients with medically unexplained symptoms. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Active {{breathing}} control (ABC) systems, {{including the}} commercial Active Breathing Coordinator™ (Elekta, Norcross, GA), {{were developed to}} permit more reproducible breath holds. ABC consists of a spirometer-controlled valve that can be set by the patient to close at a predefined lung volume, typically chosen between 50 and 80 percent of the maximum[46]. The patient controls {{the duration of the}} breath hold, making the process flexible to inter-patient and intra-patient variations in breathing patterns. Changes in absolute lung volume are assumed to be the primary cause of respiratory-induced tumor motion, meaning that control over this parameter can effectively reduce uncertainty in time-dependent tumor position by “freezing” the breathing state. Several requirements must be met under ABC-managed PET/CT imaging and treatment delivery: continuity of respiratory trace, patient suitability to achieve reproducible breath hold, and sufficient temporal efficiency. Spirometric measurement of lung volume relies on continuous changes in airflow within an airtight breathing apparatus, which {{has been shown to be}} susceptible to signal drifts[47]. Under circumstances when the seal on the ABC <b>breathing</b> tube <b>mouthpiece</b> temporarily breaks, or when the spirometer propeller rapidly changes angular direction at end-of-exhale, the respiratory trace may exhibit discontinuities that reduce the accuracy of the lung volume calculation. These errors are compounded by the inability of certain patients to consistently reach lung volumes that allow sufficiently large breath holds, typically at least 15 [*]seconds. Short and infrequent breath holds reduce the temporal efficiency of both PET/CT imaging and treatment delivery, leading to protracted procedures that may no longer be clinically viable. ABC-based motion suppression is therefore indicated in patients with lung function that permits reproducible inspiration and the ability to frequently engage in a forced breath-hold[48].|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Evidence that noninvasive {{intermittent}} positive-pressure ventilation (NiIPPV) improves exercise {{capacity in}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) is limited. The effectiveness of different ventilators {{in this setting}} has not been studied. Three bilevel pressure support ventilators (Bipap S/T 30, Nippy 2 and Vpap II ST), applied via a mouthpiece, were compared during submaximal treadmill exercise in eight subjects with COPD. Subjects walked to exhaustion with each of the ventilators and while <b>breathing</b> through the <b>mouthpiece</b> alone, in random order. In addition, four unencumbered walks were performed. The unencumbered distance (mean¡SD) walked was 259 ¡ 123 m. With the mouth-piece alone this decreased to 211 ¡ 96 m and fell further to 145 ¡ 76 m with NiIPPV. There was no difference between the brands of ventilator. At the break-point of exercise, significant increases were seen in tidal volume and minute ventilation in the ventilator walks compared with the mouthpiece alone. Noninvasive intermittent positive-pressure ventilation increased ventilation but did not improve exercise capacity in the subjects in this study. No significant differences were seen between the ventilators. The effectiveness of this technique and the optimal method of assistance require further clarification...|$|R

The total uptake of toluene was 2. 2 (standard deviation (SD) 0. 2) mmol, or 50 % of the amount inhaled. Four hours after the end of exposure 1. 4 (SD 0. 3) mmol or 65 % of the total uptake had been excreted in urine as 2 H-hippuric acid and 20 hours after the end of exposure the cumulative excretion of 2 H-hippuric acid was 1. 8 (SD 0. 3) mmol, or 78 % of the total uptake. By contrast the cumulative excretion of labelled plus unlabelled hippuric acid exceeded the total uptake of toluene already after four hours. The excretion rate of 2 H-hippuric acid was highest, about 5 mumol/min, during exposure and the SD between the subjects was low. The background concentrations of unlabelled hippuric acid in urine were high, however, and there were large differences between subjects. These findings confirm earlier indications that for low exposure, urinary hippuric acid concentration cannot be used for biological monitoring of exposure to toluene...|$|R
40|$|Antibiotic aerosol {{treatment}} is successful in treating Pseudomonas infection {{in some patients}} with cystic fibrosis, but the amount of drug reaching the lungs is unknown. The deposition patterns of carbenicillin aerosols delivered from two commercially available nebuliser systems (the Turret nebuliser plus Maxi compressor and the Inspiron nebuliser plus Traveller compressor) have been compared in six patients with cystic fibrosis during tidal breathing. The aerosol mass median diameters were 3. 2 and 7. 3 microns. In addition, the aerosol from the Turret-Maxi nebuliser system was inhaled {{by a combination of}} tidal and deep breathing. After two minutes' <b>breathing</b> via a <b>mouthpiece</b> the mean (SEM) deposition in the lungs was 15. 60 (1. 5) mg carbenicillin with the Turret nebuliser plus Maxi compressor, but only 6. 54 (1. 09) mg with the Inspiron nebuliser plus Traveller compressor; the distribution pattern within the lung was significantly more peripheral with the former nebuliser system. These differences may be ascribed partly to the smaller droplet size from the Turret system and partly to the higher nebulisation rate from the more powerful Maxi compressor. Tidal plus deep breathing produced a further small but non-significant increase in lung aerosol deposition. A seventh patient, who failed to complete the trial, had little aerosol deposited in his lungs because he inhaled through his nose. These results emphasise the importance of correct selection of nebuliser equipment for antibiotic aerosol treatment...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Study of {{the links}} between {{breathing}} pattern, negative affectivity, and psychosomatic complaints at rest and following hyperventilation. Methods: in 819 patients with anxiety and somatoform disorders and 159 healthy subjects, self-reported symptoms, breathing pattern, and end-tidal CO 2 concentration (FetCO(2)) were recorded during rest and following a hyperventilation provocation test (HVPT). The relationship between disorder category, symptoms, age, and score of STAI-trait (as a measure of negative affectivity) on the one hand, and breathing pattern on the other was investigated, separately in men and women. Results: Anxiety disorders, {{and to a lesser}} extent, somatoform disorders, were characterized by breathing instability (progressive decrease of FetCO(2) at rest during <b>mouthpiece</b> <b>breathing,</b> delayed recovery of FetCO(2) following HVPT), the mean values of respiratory frequency, and FetCO(2) being modulated by STAI-trait. After grouping the symptoms into independent factors, links were observed between symptoms and breathing pattern, independently from the presence of an anxiety or somatoform disorder. Conclusion: Some symptom factors appeared to be related to a lower FetCO(2) during hyperventilation, others likely directly influenced the breathing pattern. Among those, mainly respiratory symptoms were accompanied by a reduction of FetCO(2) at rest, with slower recovery of FetCO(2) following HVPT. The latter was observed also in the presence of marked anxiety. In contrast, subjects complaining of dizziness, fainting, and paresthesias in daily life presented higher values of FetCOz following HVPT, probably due to a voluntary braking of ventilation during HVPT.

40|$|The von Hippel-Lindau tumour {{suppressor}} protein-hypoxia-inducible factor (VHL-HIF) pathway {{has attracted}} widespread medical interest as a transcriptional system controlling cellular responses to hypoxia, yet insights into {{its role in}} systemic human physiology remain limited. Chuvash polycythaemia has recently been defined as {{a new form of}} VHL-associated disease, distinct from the classical VHL-associated inherited cancer syndrome, in which germline homozygosity for a hypomorphic VHL allele causes a generalised abnormality in VHL-HIF signalling. Affected individuals thus provide a unique opportunity to explore the integrative physiology of this signalling pathway. This study investigated patients with Chuvash polycythaemia in order to analyse the role of the VHL-HIF pathway in systemic human cardiopulmonary physiology. Twelve participants, three with Chuvash polycythaemia and nine controls, were studied at baseline and during hypoxia. Participants <b>breathed</b> through a <b>mouthpiece,</b> and pulmonary ventilation was measured while pulmonary vascular tone was assessed echocardiographically. Individuals with Chuvash polycythaemia were found to have striking abnormalities in respiratory and pulmonary vascular regulation. Basal ventilation and pulmonary vascular tone were elevated, and ventilatory, pulmonary vasoconstrictive, and heart rate responses to acute hypoxia were greatly increased. The features observed in this small group of patients with Chuvash polycythaemia are highly characteristic of those associated with acclimatisation to the hypoxia of high altitude. More generally, the phenotype associated with Chuvash polycythaemia demonstrates that VHL {{plays a major role in}} the underlying calibration and homeostasis of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, most likely through its central role in the regulation of HIF...|$|R

Despite {{the growing popularity of}} trail and off-road running, little research has been done to investigate the effects of running on irregular surfaces. PURPOSE: The purpose was to investigate the kinematic and metabolic effects of running on an irregular surface. We hypothesized that the irregular surface would cause runners to reduce frontal plane foot inversion and increase knee flexion at contact, increasing the metabolic cost of running and shock attenuation. We also examined how altering the frontal plane foot angle at contact using real-time feedback would affect these other variables. METHODS: Sixteen participants completed three running bouts lasting 5 - 7 minutes each on an irregular surface (IS) treadmill created by attaching wooden slats, on a traditional smooth surface (SS) treadmill, and on SS while receiving visual feedback of the frontal plane foot angle at contact (SSF) with a goal of matching IS foot angle on SS.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Dhokalia, Parsons, and Anderson (Psychosom Med 1998; 60 : 33 - 37) found a {{positive}} correlation between a trait measure of negative affectivity (NA; neuroticism) and resting end-tidal fractional concentration of CO 2 (FetCO 2) (fractional-concentration of end-tidal carbon dioxide) in a nonclinical sample. This contrasts sharply with studies reporting a negative association of FetCO 2 with state measures of NA and with studies reporting no or a negative relationship between FetCO 2 and trait NA. In two studies we aimed to clarify this paradox. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the first study, 110 participants (83 women) completed the PANAS and a Checklist for Psychosomatic Symptoms in daily life. FetCO 2 was measured noninvasively during 5 minutes via a nose cannula connected to a capnograph. In the second study, FetCO 2 of high (N= 20, 10 men) and low (N= 20, 10 men) NA participants was sampled once with a nasal cannula and once while <b>breathing</b> through a <b>mouthpiece</b> for 6 minutes each during rest, completion of the NEO-PI-R questionnaire, and completion of a verbal knowledge test. RESULTS: The first study found no association between trait NA and resting FetCO 2 after partialling out the effects of gender, menstrual phase, and use of oral contraceptives. The second study showed that FetCO 2 increased significantly in the high NA group only when the particpants filled out the questionnaires, regardless of its type. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, no association between dispositional NA and cross-situational FetCO 2 was observed.

Each subject repeated {{each of the three}} oxygenation techniques four times. The end-tidal fraction of oxygen was measured, and the oxygen uptake at the mouth was measured breath by breath. The additional difference between oxygen uptake at the mouth during the period of breathing oxygen (as compared with that during air breathing) was taken to represent the total oxygen sequestrated into body stores. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD maximum end-tidal fraction of oxygen after the 4 DB method was 0. 83 +/- 0. 09, which was significantly less than either after the 3 -min method (0. 92 +/- 0. 01; P < 0. 04) or after the 8 DB method (0. 91 +/- 0. 04; P < 0. 03). The mean additional oxygen taken up during oxygenation with the 4 DB method was 1. 67 +/- 0. 45 l, which was significantly lower than with the 3 -min method (2. 23 +/- 0. 85 l; P < 0. 04) or with the 8 DB method (2. 53 +/- 0. 74 l; P < 0. 01). There were no significant differences for these variables between the 3 -min and 8 DB methods. CONCLUSIONS: For the physiologic measurements that were made, both the 3 -min and the 8 DB method are superior to the 4 DB method. The 3 -min and 8 DB methods seem to be equally effective...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Breathlessness {{appears to}} be {{closely related to the}} {{perception}} of the outgoing motor command to breathe and should be increased in the presence of muscle weakness. However, breathlessness is not a common symptom in patients with chronic muscle disease who have weak respiratory muscles. The factors that determine the perception of respiratory effort in such patients have not been examined. METHODS [...] The inspiratory effort sensation during resting breathing and progressive hypercapnia was investigated in 12 patients with dystrophia myotonica with weak respiratory muscles (nine men and three women of mean (SD) age 41. 1 (10. 5) years; maximum inspiratory pressure 43. 1 (17. 2) cm H 2 O) and an age and sex matched control group of normal subjects of mean age 39. 6 (10. 6) years and a maximum inspiratory pressure of 123 (15. 2) cm H 2 O. RESULTS [...] During resting <b>breathing</b> with a <b>mouthpiece</b> no differences were seen in inspiratory effort sensation, mouth occlusion pressure, or tidal volume, but inspiratory time and cycle duration were significantly shorter in the patients with dystrophia. Minute ventilation (VE) was significantly higher in the patients (15. 8 (4. 0) l/min v 12. 5 (2. 6) l/min), while resting breathing was no more variable in the patients than in controls. The ventilatory response to carbon dioxide (VE/PCO 2) was not significantly lower in the patients (14. 9 (6. 9) l/min/kPa) than in the controls (17. 4 (4. 3) l/min/kPa). Effort sensation responses to carbon dioxide driven breathing were similar in the control subjects and the patients. With regression analysis of pooled data neither maximum inspiratory pressure nor disease state contributed to perceived inspiratory effort during hypercapnia. CONCLUSIONS [...] Moderately severe global respiratory muscle weakness does not appear to influence the ventilatory response to rising carbon dioxide tension or the perception of inspiratory effort in patients with dystrophia myotonica...|$|R
40|$|In the {{preceding}} companion paper (L. S. G. E. Howard and P. A. Robbins, J. Appl. Physiol. 78 : 1092 - 1097, 1995), {{we showed that}} ventilation rises during 8 h of isocapnic hypoxia. In the present study we report the changes {{that occur in the}} ventilatory response to acute hypoxia (AHVR) over 8 h of both isocapnic and poikilocapnic hypoxia. Ten subjects completed the study. Each was seated inside a chamber in which the inspired gas could be controlled so as to maintain the desired end-tidal gases (sampled via nasal catheter) constant. Three 8 -h protocols were compared: 1) isocapnic hypoxia, at an end-tidal PO 2 of 55 Torr with the end-tidal PCO 2 held at the subject's resting value; 2) poikilocapnic hypoxia, at the same end-tidal PO 2; and 3) control, where the inspired gas was air. AHVR was measured before and at 20 min and 4 and 8 h after the start of the experiment. A sequence of hypoxic square waves and sawtooth inputs was imposed by an end-tidal forcing system, with the subject <b>breathing</b> through a <b>mouthpiece.</b> End-tidal PCO 2 was held constant at 1 - 1. 5 Torr above resting. Values for hypoxic sensitivity (Gp; 1. min- 1. %- 1) and hypoxia-independent ventilation (Vc; l/min) were calculated for each test of AHVR. Both Gp and Vc increased significantly during both hypoxic exposures in relation to control (P < 0. 001, analysis of variance). Over the 8 -h period, increases in Gp were 87 % in isocapnic hypoxia and 44 % in poikilocapnic hypoxia, and increases in Vc were 89 % in isocapnic hypoxia and 84 % in poikilocapnic hypoxia. There {{were no significant differences between}} the isocapnic and poikilocapnic exposures. We conclude that Gp and Vc rise mainly as result of hypoxia per se and not the associated alkalosis...|$|R
40|$|National audienceSound {{production}} during trumpet playing {{implies the}} interaction between the performer and his instrument which requires the coordination between physiological and physical parameters under the performer's direct control. For brass instruments, some of the main issues rely on the estimation of specific parameters such as mouth pressure, lip mechanical properties and driving volume flow. A few studies (1, 2, 4, 5, 6) estimated these parameters but the measurements were not simultaneous. Their results are partial and the effect on sound quality is not addressed. In respiratory mechanics, the standard methods to measure lung volumes and flows usually require the subject to <b>breathe</b> through a <b>mouthpiece</b> and a measuring device (flowmeter) or to have their body constrained in an unnatural posture (Head-out whole body plethysmography) (2). Optoelectronic Plethysmograph (OEP) is an appropriate method to estimate performers' respiratory volumes as a function of time during playing (3). IRCAM Paris adapted an embedded air velocity sensor on the tuning slide of a Yamaha Bb trumpet. The combination of both set-ups gives simultaneous data of operating volumes and flows, radiated sound and mouth static pressure during advanced trumpet playing (Respiratory mechanics lab- CIRMMT, Schulich School of Music, McGill University and Instrumental Acoustics laboratory, IRCAM). It also allows to compare both processes and to evaluate their efficiency according to specific musical tasks. Previous studies showed that sound frequency and amplitude increase with pressure and flow increases. Average flows reported range from 180 to 630 ml/s (1, 2, 4, 5, 6). Preliminary analysis of our data showed peak flows up to 950 ml/s during low fortissimo notes. Correlations between these physical control parameters and some sound characteristics (pitch, sound pressure level, noisiness) are demonstrated. 1. Bouhuys A. (1964), 2. Bouhuys A. (1969), 3.

40|$|Background: The von Hippel–Lindau tumour {{suppressor}} protein–hypoxia-inducible factor (VHL–HIF) pathway {{has attracted}} widespread medical interest as a transcriptional system controlling cellular responses to hypoxia, yet insights into {{its role in}} systemic human physiology remain limited. Chuvash polycythaemia has recently been defined as {{a new form of}} VHL-associated disease, distinct from the classical VHL-associated inherited cancer syndrome, in which germline homozygosity for a hypomorphic VHL allele causes a generalised abnormality in VHL–HIF signalling. Affected individuals thus provide a unique opportunity to explore the integrative physiology of this signalling pathway. This study investigated patients with Chuvash polycythaemia in order to analyse the role of the VHL–HIF pathway in systemic human cardiopulmonary physiology. Methods and Findings: Twelve participants, three with Chuvash polycythaemia and nine controls, were studied at baseline and during hypoxia. Participants <b>breathed</b> through a <b>mouthpiece,</b> and pulmonary ventilation was measured while pulmonary vascular tone was assessed echocardiographically. Individuals with Chuvash polycythaemia were found to have striking abnormalities in respiratory and pulmonary vascular regulation. Basal ventilation and pulmonary vascular tone were elevated, and ventilatory, pulmonary vasoconstrictive, and heart rate responses to acute hypoxia were greatly increased. Conclusions: The features observed in this small group of patients with Chuvash polycythaemia are highly characteristic of those associated with acclimatisation to the hypoxia of high altitude. More generally, the phenotype associated with Chuvash polycythaemia demonstrates that VHL {{plays a major role in}} the underlying calibration and homeostasis of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, most likely through its central role in the regulation of HIF.

40|$|To {{compare the}} effects of sub-anaesthetic {{concentrations}} of propofol and halothane on the respiratory control system, we have studied the acute ventilatory response to isocapnic hypoxia (AHVR) in 12 adults with and without three different concentrations of propofol and halothane. Target doses for propofol were 0, 0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 2 of the effective plasma concentration (EC 50 = 8. 1 micrograms ml- 1). Target doses for halothane were 0, 0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 2 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC = 0. 77 %). The doses achieved experimentally were 0. 01, 0. 06, 0. 13 and 0. 26 of the EC 50 for propofol and 0, 0. 05, 0. 11 and 0. 20 MAC for halothane. During the experiment subjects <b>breathed</b> via a <b>mouthpiece</b> from an end-tidal forcing system. End-tidal PO 2 (PE'O 2) was held at 13. 3 kPa for 5 min, and then at 6. 7 kPa for 5 min. End-tidal PCO 2 (PE'CO 2) was held constant at 0. 13 - 0. 27 kPa greater than the subject's natural level throughout. The mean values for AHVR with propofol were: 12. 8 (SEM 2. 4) litre min- 1 (0. 01 EC 50), 10. 0 (1. 9) litre min- 1 (0. 06 EC 50), 9. 8 (2. 3) litre min- 1 (0. 13 EC 50) and 4. 9 (1. 2) litre min- 1 (0. 26 EC 50). The values for AHVR with halothane were: 11. 9 (2. 4) litre min- 1 (0 MAC), 7. 8 (1. 6) litre min- 1 (0. 05 MAC), 5. 9 (1. 2) litre min- 1 (0. 11 MAC) and 3. 2 (1. 6) litre min- 1 (0. 2 MAC). The decline in AHVR with increasing dose for both drugs was statistically significant (ANOVA, P < 0. 001); {{there was no significant}} difference between the two drugs with respect to this decline. Normoxic ventilation with propofol declined from 13. 2 (1. 6) litre min- 1 (0. 01 EC 50) to 8. 3 (0. 9 litre min- 1 (0. 26 EC 50), and with halothane declined from 13. 5 (2. 0) litre min- 1 (0 MAC) to 11. 8 (1. 6) litre min- 1 (0. 2 MAC). This was significant for both drugs (ANOVA, P < 0. 001) ...|$|R
