50|$|All {{water-soluble}} components will {{be present}} in the resulting extract. Hot water extraction performed without high pressure can be compared to a traditional tea-making process; the therapeutic potential will be limited because of the damage caused by the high temperature, as described above. Water-insoluble components, such as phytosterols, betulinic acid and <b>betulin,</b> will be absent in a hot water extract. Several extraction rounds combined with modern pharmaceutical techniques such as alcohol precipitation as a final step can result in high levels of polysaccharides, up to almost 60%. The ß-D-glucans, the bio-active part of these polysaccharides, might add up to ±35% in a very pure extract. Polyphenolic components are water-solubles and will also be present.|$|E
50|$|A major {{inconvenience}} for {{the future}} clinical development of betulinic acid and analogues resides in their poor solubility in aqueous media such as blood serum and polar solvents used for bioassays. To circumvent this problem of hydrosolubility and to enhance pharmacological properties, many derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for cytotoxic activity. One study showed C-20 modifications involve the loss of cytotoxicity. Another study demonstrated {{the importance of the}} presence of the -COOH group, since compounds substituted at this position, such as lupeol and methyl betulinate, were less active on human melanoma than betulinic acid. Moreover, some C-28 amino acids and C-3 phthalates derivatives exhibited higher cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines with improved selective toxicity and water solubility. Chatterjee et al. obtained the 28-O-β-D-glucopyranoside of betulinic acid by microbial transformation with Cunninghamella species, while Baglin et al. obtained it by organic synthesis. This glucoside did not exhibit any significant in vitro activity on human melanoma (MEL-2) and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT-29) cell lines, which confirms the importance of the carboxylic acid function to preserve the cytotoxicity. Recently, Gauthier et al. synthesized a series of 3-O-glycosides of betulinic acid which exhibited a strongly potent in vitro anticancer activity against human cancer cell lines.A source of soluble and ingestible betulinic acid (and its precursor, <b>betulin)</b> is the chaga (Inonotus obliquus), a slow-growing medicinal fungus found as a parasite on birch trees in the coldest regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This mushroom converts the <b>betulin</b> present in the bark of the birch into a soluble and ingestible form of betulinic acid. Using a proper extraction protocol (alcohol/ethanol extraction) will make the compounds available for oral consumption. The slow-growing nature of the fungus (7-10 years minimum) and because it cannot be cultivated without losing most of its properties make this an unreliable source, though.|$|E
5000|$|The milky sap of spurges (called [...] "latex") {{evolved as}} a {{deterrent}} to herbivores. It is white, and transparent when dry, except in E. abdelkuri, where it is yellow. The pressurized sap seeps from the slightest wound and congeals after a few minutes in air. The skin-irritating and caustic effects are largely caused by varying amounts of diterpenes. Triterpenes such as <b>betulin</b> and corresponding esters are other major components of the latex. In contact with mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth), the latex can produce extremely painful inflammation. Therefore, spurges should be handled with caution and kept away from children and pets. Latex on skin should be washed off immediately and thoroughly. Congealed latex is insoluble in water, but can be removed with an emulsifier such as milk or soap. A physician should be consulted if inflammation occurs, as severe eye damage including permanent blindness may result from exposure to the sap. When large succulent spurges in a greenhouse are cut, vapours can cause irritation to the eyes and throat several metres away. Precautions, including sufficient ventilation, are required.|$|E
3000|$|To {{investigate}} structure–activity {{relations between}} the sugar chain structures of triterpenoid saponins and their plant growth regulation effects, several monodesmosidic saponins with <b>betulin</b> as an aglycon were synthesized by chemical and enzymic reactions. Three triterpenoids (<b>betulin,</b> betulinic acid, oleanolic acid) and synthesized <b>betulin</b> glycosides were submitted to germination and growth regulation tests on alfalfa seeds. We concluded the following. <b>Betulin</b> had a slight growth inhibitory effect on alfalfa radicles. <b>Betulin</b> glycosides exhibited stronger effects than <b>betulin,</b> and <b>betulin</b> glycosides with two to four glucose residues as a sugar moiety had the greatest inhibitory activity. These characteristics of growth inhibitory effects were considerably {{different from those of}} phenolic compounds so far reported. Some <b>betulin</b> glycosides also showed a significant growth regulation effect on alfalfa hypocotyls. However, hypocotyl growth was less affected than radicle growth for all <b>betulin</b> glycosides. Among the triterpenoids, betulinic acid had stronger growth inhibitory effects on alfalfa radicles than <b>betulin,</b> suggesting the importance of the carboxyl group at the C- 28 position for the inhibitory effects of lupane-type triterpenoids. On the other hand, no germination regulation effects on alfalfa seeds were observed for any of the <b>betulin</b> glycosides or triterpenoids examined.|$|E
40|$|A new and {{relatively}} simple method for purification of <b>betulin</b> from birch bark extract {{was developed in}} this study. Its five purification steps {{are based on the}} differential solubility of extract components in various solvents and their crystallization and/or precipitation, on their affinity for Ca(OH) 2 in ethanol, and on the affinity of some impurities for silica gel in chloroform. In addition, all used solvents can be simply recycled. <b>Betulin</b> of more than 99 % purity can be prepared by this method with minimal costs. Various observations including crystallization of <b>betulin,</b> changes in crystals during heating, and attempt of localization of <b>betulin</b> in outer birch bark are also described in this work. The original extract, fraction without betulinic acid and lupeol, amorphous fraction of pure <b>betulin,</b> final crystalline fraction of pure <b>betulin</b> and commercial <b>betulin</b> as a standard were employed to determine the antiproliferative/cytotoxic effect.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Betulin</b> is a pentacyclic triterpene {{found in}} the outer barks of innumerous plants.

40|$|Introduction: Pentacyclic triterpenes are a {{group of}} {{compounds}} known to have anticancer activity. One of the best characterized triterpenes is <b>betulin,</b> which can be isolated from bark of birch trees and modified into new compounds with various interesting medical properties. <b>Betulin</b> is involved in activation of the caspase cascade and promotes cell death. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the effect of <b>betulin</b> and its acetylenic derivative, 28 -O-propynoylbetulin, on proliferation and apoptosis in a human melanoma cell line. Materials and Methods: The G- 361 melanoma cell line was used. To evaluate growth arrest and caspase- 3 activity, cells were treated with <b>betulin</b> and its derivative at a wide range of concentrations from 0. 1 to 10 μg/mL. Results: <b>Betulin</b> and 28 -O-propynoylbetulin inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. The cell cycle analysis revealed an increase of the sub-G 1 cell fraction (representing dead cells) after incubation of cells with <b>betulin</b> and 28 -O-propynoylbetulin. The observed cytotoxic effects were more pronounced for 28 -O-propynoylbetulin. Activity of caspase- 3 in 28 -O-propynoylbetulin treated cells was nearly 2 -fold greater compared to cells incubated with <b>betulin.</b> Discussion: Our results show that <b>betulin</b> and 28 -O-propynoylbetulin were effective in inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis in a human melanoma cell line. The addition of the propynoyl group at the C- 28 hydroxyl group of <b>betulin</b> led to a greater proapoptotic and antiproliferative effect in comparison to unmodified <b>betulin.</b> These observations suggest that the obtained derivative is a potent anti-melanoma agent. ...|$|E

40|$|SummarySterol {{regulatory}} element-binding proteins (SREBPs) {{are major}} transcription factors activating {{the expression of}} genes involved in biosynthesis of cholesterol, fatty acid and triglyceride. In this study, we identified a small molecule, <b>betulin,</b> that specifically inhibited the maturation of SREBP by inducing interaction of SREBP cleavage activating protein (SCAP) and Insig. Inhibition of SREBP by <b>betulin</b> decreased the biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acid.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assay by NMR the {{metabolites}} which contribute to <b>betulin</b> production. 8 -day-old suspended birch (Betula platyphylla) cells were treated by sodium nitroprusside (SNP) treatment, an NO donor, and 2 -(4 -carboxyphenyl) - 4, 4, 5, 5 -tetramethyl-imidazoline- 1 -oxyl- 3 -oxide (cPTIO), an NO-specific scavenger. The results showed that <b>betulin</b> production was increased by five times after SNP treatment, similar with that of the control under cPTIO treatment. Forty one metabolites were detected after SNP treatment or cPTIO treatment. Among them, 10 were found to significantly contribute to the differences observed between controls and treated cell culture samples. To validate the contribution of the above 10 metabolites to <b>betulin</b> production, myo-inositol, fructose and phenylalanine based on correlation analysis between the content of 12 metabolites and <b>betulin</b> were used to feed birch suspension cell cultures under SNP treatment.
