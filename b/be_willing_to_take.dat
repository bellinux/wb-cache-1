However, Mack later dropped the idea, saying that Ruth's wife would be running the team in a month if Ruth ever took over.|$|E
5|$|With the {{termination}} of NSB and SJ cooperation Linx on the Oslo–Stockholm route in January 2005, Ofotbanen announced they would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over operation of the route from the summer. However, SJ and NSB held monopolies on non-subsidized passenger trains services in their respective countries, {{and it would not}} be possible for a private company to operate the route. In May 2007, the company announced its plans for the Oslo–Stockholm train, after necessary permissions had been granted from Norwegian and Swedish authorities. By then, SJ had already reopened its route on the line. In March 2008, plans had been launched to start operations in April, but Ofotbanen had not met the requirements to get a safety licence from the inspectorate. The company rented rolling stock from SJ, including an Rc locomotives, and newly renovated cars from the 1960s. The service was a cooperation between Ofotbanen and the Swedish company Scandinavian Railway.|$|E

25|$|With David II in his custody, Edward III {{had a good}} {{opportunity}} to try to reach terms, though Edward Balliol's interests were a sticking point. He had evidently prepared to overlook them by the time he made his first offer, in 1348, which seems to have been that David II would hold Scotland as a fief for England, naming Edward III or one of his sons as his successor, should he die without children. This had altered somewhat by 1350 when Edward III sent Douglas of Liddelsdale, also in custody in the Tower of London, to see if the Scots would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> different terms: to ransom David II for a fee of £40,000, the restoration of the disinherited lords, and the naming of Edward III's young son John of Gaunt as David's successor, should he die without children. David himself is credited with removing Edward III's name from the line of succession in Scotland, and the Scots seem to have been willing to entertain the idea as they sent Douglas of Liddesdale back for further negotiation and David II was himself permitted to briefly return to Scotland in early 1352 to try to seal the deal. Stewart would obviously be disinclined to support terms that removed him from succession, but he seems ultimately not to have been alone. The Parliament convened in March 1352 did not find the prospect of submitting to the English a fair trade for the freedom of their king. David II was sent back.|$|E

500|$|In October 1946, Kimball {{and several}} other general {{authorities}} toured the Navajo Nation {{in an effort to}} improve relations between the LDS Church and the Navajo people. Kimball was dismayed at the abject poverty among the Navajo and empathized with their distrust of the US government. At that time, the average Navajo person ate no more than [...] a day, and a single dentist served the entire population of 55,000. Though the reservation of the Navajo Nation covered , only 0.01% of that area was arable. In 1947, Golden Buchanan, an LDS leader in Sevier County, Utah, heard of a 17-year-old Navajo girl working on a sugar beet farm who wanted to stay in Utah and attend public school. Buchanan wrote Kimball with an idea for the children of Navajo families to live with local LDS families so that they could receive proper nutrition and educations. Kimball supported the idea and asked Buchanan if his family would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Helen John, the Navajo girl, as a foster daughter to begin the program. Buchanan's family agreed. While it took time to develop the program, that {{is referred to as the}} start of the LDS Church's Indian Placement Program, also known as the [...] "Lamanites Placement Program." [...] By 1954, the program had 68 students, and the Church had standardized some of its approach. By 1969, nearly 5,000 students were placed with LDS families throughout the Western United States and Canada.|$|E
500|$|On August 4, 2007, at 2:45a.m., she {{discovered}} {{the money that}} became part of a political scandal in the electoral campaign of President of Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. It was {{in the possession of}} a Key Biscayne, Florida, associate of President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez. The carrier, Guido Antonini Wilson (who is referred to in the press by both Antonini and Wilson and who is sometimes referred to by the nicknames [...] "El Gordo" [...] or [...] "The Fat Man"), is an interpreter and was part of a delegation of executives that traveled to Argentina in advance of Chávez' energy deal signing. He opened the bag at the insistence of Telpuk, who noticed the six dense and perfectly rectangular blocks in the luggage scans. At first, Wilson had explained the items as books and papers. When forced to open it, he began to stammer and show signs of nervousness, and he said the suitcase only contained about $60,000. The blocks turned out to be US$790,550. The delegation, which arrived on a Cessna Citation jet from Caracas, Venezuela, chartered by Energía Argentina, SA, carried five Venezuelans and three Argentines who represented their respective governments' energy companies. In a country known for its corruption, Telpuk did not have an interest in a bribe although she felt Wilson may have expected her to <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> one.

500|$|The article {{revealed}} that early scripts {{for the movie}} were {{going to focus on}} series heroine Samus Aran and her origin. Tiger Hill wanted to explore Samus prior to her becoming the lone bounty hunter featured in the series. According to Foxhoven, the movie version of Samus Aran was [...] "to be an exceptionally talented, but also flawed character who was looking for redemption," [...] and elaborating that, [...] "We wanted to see her struggle, to be humbled, and to be forced to rise up against crazy odds. And of course we wanted to see the cool weapons in all of their glory." [...] The major problem that the writers faced was attempting to build-out Samus's back-story, Nintendo had [...] "creative" [...] and [...] "licensing" [...] walls that the writers ran into. Foxhoven stated that these questions came up: [...] "What are they doing when they are NOT fighting? What is their daily existence and relationships? What are Samus's aspirations, history, and fears?" [...] and further stated that [...] "Nintendo appreciated the questions, but had never thought about them before, and ultimately didn't have a lot of answers" [...] and at the end, Nintendo [...] "felt uncomfortable with our team [...] being the ones to propose those answers" [...] which basically caused the Metroid movie project to be ultimately canceled sometime in 2007. Foxhoven however foresees Metroid becoming a movie, stating {{at the end of the}} IGN interview that [...] "for Nintendo, they walked away appreciating the process and how much further they needed to explore the franchise so that it has a chance for a feature film at some point" [...] and he {{revealed that}} [...] "there are quite a few Hollywood executives in town who grew up playing Metroid, and who would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the time needed to bring Nintendo along in the process." ...|$|E
