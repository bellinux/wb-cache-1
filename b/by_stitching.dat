25|$|Manufacturing {{processes}} mainly {{depend on}} the material of the shell.

25|$|The huipil is a tunic-like garment made <b>by</b> <b>stitching</b> {{together}} {{anywhere from}} one to five pieces of cloth. The most common fiber is cotton, but there are those made from wool and silk as well. Most huipils are made from two or three pieces, which are usually the same size, with one exception being those from the highlands of Chiapas, where the center piece is wider than the side ones. The panels are not sewn together in the normal sense with seams but rather they are joined using ribbons, small strips of cloth or complicated stitching which has {{the edges of the}} panels touching or almost touching. This adds a layer of decoration to the garment.|$|E

500|$|The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is a 2009 Dutch horror film written, directed, and co-produced by Tom Six. The film {{tells the}} story of a German surgeon who kidnaps three {{tourists}} and joins them surgically, mouth to anus, forming a [...] "human centipede", a conjoined triplet. It stars Dieter Laser as the creator of the centipede, Dr. Josef Heiter, with Ashley C. Williams, Ashlynn Yennie, and Akihiro Kitamura as his victims. According to Six, the concept of the film arose from a joke he made with friends about punishing a child molester <b>by</b> <b>stitching</b> his mouth to the anus of a [...] "fat truck driver". Inspiration for the film also came from Nazi medical experiments carried out during World War II, such as the crimes of Josef Mengele at the Auschwitz concentration camp.|$|E
500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the film's plot came from a joke that writer/director Tom Six once made to his friends about punishing a child molester they saw on TV <b>by</b> <b>stitching</b> his mouth to the anus of an overweight truck driver. Six saw this as the concept for a great horror film, {{and he began to}} develop the idea. He has said he was heavily influenced as a filmmaker by the early works of David Cronenberg and Japanese horror films. Six has said he prefers horror films that are more realistic over [...] "unbelievable" [...] monster films, and said that he gets [...] "a rash from too much political correctness." [...] Major influences for The Human Centipede were Pier Paolo Pasolini's controversial 1975 Italian drama film Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom, which was notable for its scenes depicting intensely graphic violence, sadism, and sexual depravity, as was the work of Japanese director Takashi Miike. Six has also expressed his love of the works of David Lynch. Further inspiration came from Six's previous work as a director on the Dutch series of Big Brother, where {{he had been able to}} observe people who [...] "did crazy things when they were alone and thought they were not (being) watched." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{rectification}} theorem {{says that}} away from singular points the dynamics of a point in a small patch is a straight line. [...] The patch can sometimes be enlarged <b>by</b> <b>stitching</b> several patches together, and when this works out in the whole phase space M the dynamical system is integrable. [...] In most cases the patch cannot be extended to the entire phase space. [...] There may be singular points in the vector field (where v(x)=0); or the patches may become smaller and smaller as some point is approached. The more subtle reason is a global constraint, where the trajectory starts out in a patch, and after visiting a series of other patches {{comes back to the}} original one. If the next time the orbit loops around phase space in a different way, then it is impossible to rectify the vector field in the whole series of patches.|$|E

2500|$|Chemistry explores a more {{innovative}} approach to pop music, straying from the typical verse-chorus form present in most songs. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that Chemistry is [...] "a record that dispenses with the tiresome business of verses and instead opts for songs apparently constructed <b>by</b> <b>stitching</b> eight different choruses together." [...] BBC Music exclaimed that Girls Aloud [...] "have resuscitated its corpse by wedding chart-friendly melodies to experimental avant-garde sounds". The album takes influences {{from a wide}} variety of sources, including [...] "everything from French chanson to piano-pounding blues to the clipped R of the Small Faces". Rapping in the same vein as artists like Betty Boo and Neneh Cherry is prominent. Guitars are present for most of the album. Yahoo! Music says [...] "there's nary a 'formula' in sight. There are as many sudden tonal and tempo switches as the tricksiest Chicago art rock band. And all but one song here gives guitars a starring role." [...] The songs are noticeably less rooted in electronic music, although [...] "Swinging London Town" [...] is [...] "a dark, squiggly synth pop epic" [...] and [...] "It's Magic" [...] is composed of [...] "little Royksopp-like keyboard riffs".|$|E
2500|$|The match {{scheduled}} {{to be held in}} Melbourne was held almost two weeks after the second test in Sydney, was held and the Indians had already shown some fight in the second match and so they did in the third, albeit in the first innings only. The match started off with the Australians winning the toss and choosing to bat first. Immediately, the Indians got a breakthrough in the form of Barnes' wicket, bowled by Mankad with the score on 29. Then, Arthur Morris, and Don Bradman staged a fightback <b>by</b> <b>stitching</b> together a 70-run partnership, before Morris was bowled by Amarnath for a patient 45 crafted from 123 balls with three fours. Lindsay Hassett entered the fray with the score poised on 99, with his captain, Bradman batting. Hassett was dropped in the slips off Vijay Hazare's bowling when he was batting on 31. This lapse proved too costly for the Indians, because Hassett and Bradman staged a counterattack on the Indian bowlers with some fast scoring, Wisden's own words, Hassett was [...] "scored as fast as his partner", and that, [...] "...at times runs came at two a minute". Hassett's was the third wicket to fall, with the scorecard reading 268, gifting Mankad his second scalp. Then Bradman fell to Phadkar, for 132 scored only off 204 balls at a strike-rate excess of 60. After his dismissal, the wickets were easy to come by, with the last six falling for a mere 105.|$|E

After serving up three perfectly round scoops of brain in a glass bowl, Stitches adds blood as a topping to complete his grisly ice cream sundae. Sarah, Paul's girlfriend, enters the attic to look for him. There, she is attacked <b>by</b> <b>Stitches,</b> and manages to fight back. As she escapes, Stitches drives an umbrella through her skull, killing her. Through his telescope, Tommy sees Stitches in the house, and goes to warn Vinnie of his presence, but is at first unsuccessful, due to Vinnie's desire to have sex with a formerly overweight classmate.
