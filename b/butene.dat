Because the reaction is exothermic, cooling is needed: SAAU plants require lower temperatures so the cooling medium needs to be chilled, for HFAU normal refinery cooling water will suffice. It {{is important to keep}} a high ratio of Isobutane to Alkene at the point of reaction to prevent side reactions which produces a lower octane product, so the plants have a high recycle of Isobutane back to feed. The phases separate spontaneously, so the acid phase is vigorously mixed with the hydrocarbon phase to create sufficient contact surface.|$|E

25|$|The olefin feed to an {{alkylation}} unit generally originates from a FCCU {{and contains}} <b>butene,</b> isobutene, and possibly propene and/or amylenes. The olefin feed {{is also likely}} to contain diluents (such as propane, n-butane, and n-pentane), noncondensables (such as ethane and hydrogen) and contaminants. Diluants in principle have no effect on the reaction of alkylation but occupy a portion of the reactor and can influence the yield of secondary reactions of polymerisation and of undesired organofluorine side products. Incondensable are from a chemical perspective similar to diluents but they do not condense at the pressure and temperature of the process, and therefore they concentrate to a point that must be vented. Contaminants are compounds that react with and/or dilute the sulfuric acid catalyst. They increase acid consumption and contribute to produce undesirable reaction products and increase polymer formation. Common contaminants are water, methanol and ethanol.|$|E

The reactivity of Pd–Au(111) towards the gas phase hydrogenation of 1, 3 -butadiene has been investigated in a static reactor, and compared to those of Pd–Au(110), Pd(111) and Au(111). Both Pd–Au surfaces are unreconstructed and exhibit strong surface segregation of gold.

40|$|Iso-butene is an {{important}} material {{for the production of}} chemicals and polymers. It can take part in various chemical reactions, such as hydrogenation, oxidation and other additions owing to the presence of a reactive double bond. It is usually obtained as a by-product of a petroleum refinery, by Fluidized Catalytic Cracking (FCC) of naphtha or gas-oil. However, an interesting alternative to iso-butene production is n-butane dehydroisomerization, which allows the direct conversion of n-butane via dehydrogenation and successive isomerization. In this work, a simulation analysis of an integrated membrane system is proposed for the production and recovery of <b>butenes.</b> The dehydroisomerization of n-butane to iso-butene takes place in a membrane reactor where the hydrogen is removed from the reaction side with a Pd/Ag alloys membrane. Afterwards, the retentate and permeate post-processing is performed in membrane separation units for <b>butenes</b> concentration and recovery. Four different process schemes are developed. The performance of each membrane unit is analyzed by appropriately developed performance maps, to identify the operating conditions windows and the membrane permeation properties required to maximize the recovery of the iso-butene produced.

40|$|Interproton {{coupling}} {{over five}} bonds of the peptide moiety of chelated dipeptides {{in a series}} of mono(dipeptidato) cobalt(III) complexes was studied in order to establish whether the coupling is analogous to homoallylic coupling. The rather rigid conformation of chelated dipeptides provided the reference structure for calibrating the coupling across the trans-peptide bond. The coupling constants over cis and trans pathways are both positive. Calibration of the homoallylic type expression afforded results close to those obtained for linear peptides in water but which disagree on the effect of replacement of water with DMSO. Sensitivity of the coupling on changes in electronic pi-bond character of the peptide bond was probed by protonation of the peptide oxygen. The magnitude of the coupling was scaled up 40 % upon peptide oxygen protonation in strongly acidic media (pD < 0. 5), reaching 70 % of the homoallylic coupling in <b>butenes.</b> By considering the coupling in chelated dipeptides, in rigid cyclic dipeptides, and in rigid <b>butenes,</b> it has been established that homoallylic coupling conformational dependence of peptides and <b>butenes</b> is essentially the same. status: publishe...|$|R

In this work, the gas-phase hydrogenation of 1, 3 -butadiene over the Al 13 Fe 4 (010) surface {{was investigated in}} the 0. 2 - 2 kPa range at 20 - 200 °C in a batch-type reactor coupled with an ultrahigh-vacuum setup allowing for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and {{low energy electron diffraction}} (LEED). The results were compared with those obtained for Pd(100) in the same conditions. It is shown that Al-Fe is initially as active as Pd and 100 % selective to <b>butenes,</b> including at room temperature (RT), with sequential conversions of butadiene to <b>butenes,</b> and <b>butenes</b> to butane [2, 3]. The main difference with Pd comes from the <b>butenes</b> distribution, with a cis/trans 2 -butene ratio larger than unity for Al-Fe while it is near zero for Pd. The results are discussed in terms of (i) steric constraints upon π-allylic precursors to 2 -butenes and (ii) involvement of adsorbed butyl intermediates allowing for hydro-isomerization of <b>butenes</b> competing with their hydrogenation to butane. A mechanistic reaction scheme is proposed accordingly [3]. The sensitivity of the Al-Fe surface to oxygen-containing impurities leads to gradual deactivation under reaction conditions, which is the main issue for the practical use of non-noble metal catalysts. The deactivation and oxidation processes were investigated by combining in situ post-reaction AES measurements with several thermal/chemical treatments. Depending on the pressure conditions, the Al 13 Fe 4 surface chemisorbs oxygen-containing species or forms an Al oxide layer. The RT activity of the surface decreases as the oxygen-containing phase coverage increases. However, the alloy surface can be fully regenerated through high-temperature annealing [3]. [1] M.
