25|$|Mirabilis is an Israeli {{start-up}} which pioneered {{instant messaging}} (IM) and was bought <b>by</b> <b>America</b> Online. By giving away their ICQ product {{for free and}} preventing interoperability between their client software and other products, {{they were able to}} temporarily dominate the market for instant messaging. Because of the network effect, new IM users gained much more value by choosing to use the Mirabilis system (and join its large network of users) than they would using a competing system. As was typical for that era, the company never made any attempt to generate profits from their dominant position before selling the company.|$|E
25|$|However, in reality, {{to avoid}} {{a repeat of the}} earlier collapse, China's Politburo had decided to manage America's economy via similar {{techniques}} to those used <b>by</b> <b>America</b> on other Far Eastern countries. By keeping China's exchange rate artificially low, they sold cheap goods to America, and with the proceeds, bought American bonds. The money flooding into America permitted massive loans to be made available to those who would previously have been considered too risky. In America, the belief was that computers could stabilise and hedge the lending of the money. This permitted lending beyond the point that was actually sustainable. The high level of loan defaulting led ultimately to the 2008 collapse due to a housing bubble similar to that which Far Eastern countries had previously faced.|$|E
25|$|WWF {{eventually}} surpassed its arch-rival WCW. With {{its business}} steadily declining and a corporate takeover of {{its parent company}} (Time Warner) <b>by</b> <b>America</b> Online, WCW was put up for sale and purchased by Vince McMahon in 2001, once again making WWF the single-largest wrestling company in North America. Bret Hart's entry into WCW had been hailed {{at the time as}} a major coup for the company, but it subsequently failed to utilize his popular appeal. Hart's active wrestling career ended in 2000 after he suffered a serious concussion during a match with Goldberg. After dropping the WWF title to Austin at WrestleMania XIV in 1998, Michaels was forced into retirement for four years due to a serious back injury. After a long period of rehabilitation, Michaels returned to the ring in 2002, and eventually retired for good in 2010 at Wrestlemania 26, losing a Streak vs. Career match to The Undertaker in the show's final match of the night. Michaels has occasionally reappeared for skits on WWE programming since, but has not stepped back into the ring as a competitor.|$|E

25|$|After {{the three}} century {{rule of the}} Spaniards in the Philippines came the American Occupation. American culture and {{influence}} started {{to find a place}} in a Philippine context by using various mediums, specifically the use of free trade. In this trading for and with the American market, a co-dependence between America and the Philippines was established. Another medium of cultural assimilation from America was their implementation of their education system during the first decade of their occupation, all in which showing more prevalent effects in the political and cultural development of the Filipinos. With the then-new educational system, young Filipinos were taught different American cultural devices such as their songs, values and ideals, and their subsequent assimilation of many of their traditions. All these factors brought about <b>by</b> <b>America</b> allowed for a heterogeneous assimilation between the two distinct cultures that resulted in a unique outcome of specific American influence forming a distinct Filipino image. From here, this is a rich source to understand the nation in its present situation and its historical context.|$|E

These boards sometimes were used to distribute cracked software. As late as December 2013, there were 25 such Bulletin Board Systems in operation, reachable via the Telnet protocol. There were major commercial online services, such as Compunet (UK), CompuServe (US later bought <b>by</b> <b>America</b> Online), The Source (US) and Minitel (France) among many others. These services usually required custom software which was often bundled with a modem and included free online time as they were billed by the minute. Quantum Link (or Q-Link) was a US and Canadian online service for Commodore 64 and 128 personal computers that operated from November 5, 1985, to November 1, 1994.
