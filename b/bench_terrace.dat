40|$|Soil erosion is {{considered}} as {{a serious threat to}} agricultural development in developing countries. Soil and water conservation measures, such as terraces, are often promoted to combat soil erosion and to increase agricultural production. In this paper, the short-term impact of <b>bench</b> <b>terraces,</b> 2 – 4 years after their establishment, on soil properties and maize yield in the Peruvian Andes is analysed and discussed. The results show that <b>bench</b> <b>terraces</b> did not result in any short term change in soil properties, such as fertility or infiltration capacity. Nevertheless, the <b>bench</b> <b>terraces</b> resulted in 20 % higher yields, due to a higher planting density, compared with adjacent sloping fields.

It is questioned, however, whether enough attention is paid to the suitability of the soils and to the eventual financial profitability. Terraces may reduce soil erosion and increase production but they should also provide sufficient financial gains at farm level. A plot level financial cost–benefit analysis was undertaken to examine under which social and economic conditions <b>bench</b> <b>terraces</b> are financially viable in Northern and Southern Rwanda. Farmers' estimates of respective costs and potato yields from plots with subsidized and un-subsidized <b>bench</b> <b>terraces,</b> progressive terraces and plots with no terraces at all were obtained for the analysis.

The Study site, located in the El-Gouazine watershed (central Tunisia), includes two terraced plots of approximately 3000 m(2), {{one of which was}} left fallow for several years, while the other was tilled. The characteristics of rainfall-runoff processes and erosion inside both terraced plots (luring a two-year period (2004 - 2006) are described. Ploughing reduced runoff by 7 / 5 %. Erosion was monitored following runoff episodes that produced observable deposits in the bench channel. After ploughing, erosion was reduced by 44 % between July 2004 and July 2005 and by 50 % between October 2005 and July 2006. However, erosion per millimetre of runoff was about twice as great on the tilled soil as on the fallow. Even though ploughing weakens file soil, it seems to reduce erosion by increasing infiltration.

Present study aims to evaluate common interpolation methods (triangulation, nearest neighbor, natural neighbor, minimum curvature, multiquadratic radial basis function (MRBF), ordinary kriging, and inverse distance weight) in representing the detail topography of two different tillage types, namely <b>bench</b> <b>terrace</b> and furrow. Evaluation procedure was conducted through a stepwise analysis by using combination between the accuracy level (coefficient of determination (R 2 error (ME) and standard deviation error (S)) and the shape similarity analysis. This study also shows the application of break-line function during the interpolation process in order to optimize some interpolation methods and the usage of drainage sink area as another step in evaluating DEM quality. To achieve {{the aim of this}} study, two field-size of dry-land agriculture (tegalan) were observed by using a set of total station Nikon DTM 322 with 3 ” angle accuracy. These plots, namely Tieng (1652 m²) and Buntu (673 m²), are situated in the upper part of Wonosobo District, Central Java Province, Indonesia. Tieng plot represents the <b>bench</b> <b>terrace</b> system embedded with stones on its terrace risers and showing relatively smooth ground surface. On the other side, Buntu plot shows the ridges and furrows system that lays perpendicularly to the contour lines. In terms of R², ME and S, there were slight differences in results between each method, except the multiquadratic radial basis function which was failed to generate terrace form in Tieng. The final result shows that triangulation is the best fit method followed by natural neighbour at representing the bench terraces in Tieng plot. In the case of furrow in Buntu plot, natural neighbour is the most accurate method. Despite its superiority at representing the <b>bench</b> <b>terrace,</b> triangulation has larger sink drainage area compared to natural neighbour.

Contents of most soil nutrients (e. g. available P, K+, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +) and maize grain yields varied significantly (P=. 05) between SWC technologies, with the trend: <b>bench</b> <b>terraces</b> > micro ridges >miraba>control (fields with no SWC measures). Similarly under all SWC technologies soil fertility and maize grain yields varied significantly (P=. 05) with slope position, showing the trend: lower slopes > mid slopes > upper slopes. Moreover, soil fertility and maize grain yields varied significantly (P=. 05) between segments of the studied SWC technologies except for <b>bench</b> <b>terraces.</b> The trends for both soil fertility and maize grain yields were as follows: lower segments > middle segments > upper segments under micro ridges; lower segments > upper segments > middle segments under miraba.

The results show that investment in SWC measures may not be a feasible short-term option from farmers’ perspective. There is, therefore, a strong case for intervention, especially in the initial years where SWC adoption yields negative returns. Again the maintenance cost was higher for all SWC technologies.

40|$|Despite {{widespread}} bench-terracing {{soil erosion}} remains {{a major problem}} in Java's uplands. To elucidate the causes for this lack of impact, runoff and erosion processes were studied at a variety of spatial scales within a volcanic catchment in West Java. Research indicated that soil loss occurs via rain splash and wash of rainfall-detached sediment by shallow overland flow from the terrace riser and bed, and via runoff entrainment of sediment deposited in the central terrace toe drain. The terrace erosion and sediment transport mode (TEST) was developed to physically describe these processes, as a function of vegetation and soil surface cover where appropriate, yet use as few parameters as possible. Runoff generation was described by the spatially variable infiltration model (SVIM) and a two parameter rainfall depth-intensity distribution was assumed to derive a simple analytical expression for storm runoff depth. In a similar manner expressions were derived for effective rainfall kinetic energy to predict rainfall-driven transport using a newly developed model, and for effective runoff rate to predict flow-driven transport using GUEST model theory. The model and its components were tested using measured runoff and soil loss from 31 sections of terrace beds or risers and from six terrace units during two seasons.

40|$|Farmland {{abandonment}} is a {{major problem}} in parts of Europe, particularly in mountain areas and semiarid environments. In such places, farmland abandonment represents a significant land use change from cropping to a complex of plant successions. The present study assesses the hydromorphological effects of land abandonment in Europe, and the consequences thereof with respect to water resource availability and soil erosion. The evolution of abandoned fields depends on (i) the time of abandonment; (ii) climatic conditions in the abandoned area; (iii) particular characteristics of the fields; (iv) the land management regimen following abandonment; and, (v) the role played by government policy. Throughout most of Europe, vegetation on abandoned farmland has evolved into dense forest or shrub. The expansion of vegetation explains, in part, the perceived decline in water resources, reductions in soil loss and sediment delivery, and the progressive improvement of soil characteristics. Such evolution has resulted in changing stream morphology, featuring narrowing and incision, and a decline in sedimentation level in Mediterranean reservoirs. The abandonment of <b>bench</b> <b>terrace</b> fields coincided with an increase in the occurrence of small landslides in the steps between terraces, as well as changes in the spatial organization of saturated areas. Plant colonization is slower in semiarid areas, increasing the development of soil crusts that reduce infiltration and increase overland flow.

The study of the hydrologic-hydraulic function in the terraced slopes is essential in order to evaluate the possible use of terraces as a structural measure to reduce flood risk, maintaining a low environmental impacts. The goal of this study is highlighting the analysis of the response in time of the water, which is provided by terraced slope with the dry-stone walls, considering the surface and groundwater component.

40|$|Terraces {{have been}} proven to be an {{effective}} conservation practice for controlling high soil loss. In large hydrological programs such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), terrace effects are simulated by adjusting the slope length and the USLE P-factor. In this study, a process-based terrace algorithm was developed and incorporated into SWAT (version 2009) to simulate the environmental effects of different kinds of terraces, i. e., normal and <b>bench</b> <b>terraces.</b> The terrace algorithm was activated at the hydrological response unit (HRU) level. Terrace description, storage effects, and the flow interaction between the terraces and the HRU were also introduced in the method. The modified SWAT model was evaluated using a four-year, six-plot event runoff and sediment data set with five years of plant yield data collected on a natural rainfall terraced field in southeast Franklin County, Kansas. Results indicated that the model’s performance was satisfactory in simulating single and average plot runoff as well as average plot sediment yields, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies always greater than 0. 5 and often greater than 0. 7. The model’s performance was less consistent in simulating sediment yields from the no-till plots. The development and incorporation of the terrace algorithm provide a process-based alternative {{to the use of the}} P-factor in representing the effectiveness of terraces...|$|R

Na poligonu za istraživanje erozije u Abra mima istraživanje smo proveli na obnovljenim istraživačkim parcelama, a kod naselja Grimalda na zemljištu s umjetno podignutom sastojinom crnog bora. Pokazalo se da su tehničke mjere sanacije imale ključnu ulogu u smanjenju produkcije erozijskog nanosa, osobito u ranoj fazi trajanja pokusa. Isto tako na strmim padinama vegetacijska progresija je vrlo spora, pa je i regenera cija tla vrlo spora, tako da je usprkos prirodnom naseljavanju crnog bora sklapanje sastojine vrlo sporo, a humusno-akumulativni horizont tla vrlo slabo razvijen i fragmentiran. Na blažim nagibima, koji nisu bili jako erodi rani, nesmetano širenje prirodne vegetacije (zaštita od požara) podjednakog je učinka na svojstva tla (ujedno na njegovu zaštitu, regeneraciju itd.) kao i biološka sanacija u vidu sadnje crnog bora. Odnos godišnje produkcije erozij skog nanosa i sadržaja organske tvari u tlu upućuje na bržu humizaciju i rege neraciju tla kod primjene učinkovitijih mjera suzbijanja erozije. The {{impact of}} {{biological}} and technical soil protection measu res, {{as well as}} the effect of eroded terrain recovery on soil properties, i. e. its regeneration, was investigated in two localities on flysch in Istria. Seven re search plots in the erosion research polygon in Abrami were restored for the purpose of measuring annual sediment production by erosion. The condition of soil was investigated in five plots and its regeneration was compared in terms of terrain recovery methods. Two plots were excluded: one because the terrain was completely eroded and turned into bare marl detritus, and another because it was established only recently, therefore, soil properties have not yet been changed by the treatment. Near the village of Grimalda we analyzed the condition of surface soil in the part of the terrain that was afforested in 1982. We made two separate ana lyses: one in an established black pine stand and the other on abandoned grassland displaying natural progression of forest vegetation. According to our research, the soil in all five plots in the Abrami polygon is equally carbonate, while the pH value shows alkaline reaction. These proper ties are the consequence of past erosion processes, which have led to predomi nantly bare, homogeneous, detritus of flysch. As a result, the remaining material has similar properties regardless of the applied recovery methods. Soil in the areas that are not severely eroded is eutric cambisol, while severely eroded slopes are characterized by shallow regosol. Several recovery methods were applied. In the plots restored for the purpose of monitoring sediment pro duction by erosion we analyzed the impact of a) high <b>bench</b> <b>terraces</b> with dry wall crowns, b) low and mildly sloping <b>bench</b> <b>terraces,</b> c) classical planting with black pine into holes, d) planting with black pine into <b>bench</b> <b>terraces</b> and undersowing with a grass mixture and Spanish broom, e) planting with black pine into <b>bench</b> <b>terraces</b> without undersowing, and f) areas with varying ini tial vegetation condition and varying slope degrees. It was found that technical recovery measures had {{a key role in the}} reduc tion of sediment production by erosion, especially in the early stage of the ex­periment. It was also found that very slow vegetation progression on steep slopes results in very slow soil regeneration. Thus, despite natural coloniza tion with black pine, canopy closure is very slow, while the humus-accumula tive soil horizon is poorly developed and fragmented. On milder slopes that are not severely eroded, the undisturbed expansion of natural vegetation (fire protection) produces equal effects on soil properties (and its protection, rege­neration, and similar) as does biological recovery with planting black pine. This was confirmed by research in the Grimalda locality. The only difference is slightly higher soil water permeability in the pine culture. The annual sediment production by erosion in the experimental polygon of Abrami partially coincides with the organic matter content. These processes are reversely proportional, which indicates that soil humization and regenera tion will be more rapid if erosion prevention is more efficient, or in other words, if better technical and biological recovery measures are applied...|$|R
