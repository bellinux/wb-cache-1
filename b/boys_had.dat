5|$|Pontecorvo {{created a}} neutron source using radium and beryllium, as the Via Panisperna <b>boys</b> <b>had,</b> with {{paraffin}} wax as a neutron moderator, and measured {{the absorption of}} different minerals using methods developed by Fermi and Amaldi. By June 1941, he had a device that could differentiate shale, limestone and sandstone, and map the transitions between them. The technique may be considered the first practical application {{of the discovery of}} slow neutrons, and would still be in use decades later for well logging. He filed four patents relating to his instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, on 31 August, five of {{the eleven}} hostages were {{released}} {{in exchange for a}} satellite telephone and medical supplies. The West Side <b>Boys</b> <b>had</b> originally decided to release the married men, but changed their minds at the last minute and released the three rangers and two of the corporals. The West Side Boys told the British negotiators that the officers and other NCOs would not be released until the gang's remaining demands were met. The released soldiers were flown for debriefing to RFA Sir Percivale, of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, off the coast.|$|E

5|$|When the Marlborough term began, an {{arrangement}} was made whereby City of London <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> lessons during games for Marlborough College pupils and vice versa. The difficulties at the Marlborough location ranged from finding a study for Headmaster Dale to finding enough kitchen staff to prepare food for both schools. Resources were limited and outbreaks of influenza and rubella were common. Like many other schools evacuated into the countryside, the City of London School's enrolment fell from 700 to 430 during the war, although no pupil was killed or injured {{as a direct}} result of enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|Although {{given the}} first name Lewis, Willkie was known from {{childhood}} by his middle name. Herman Willkie, who had come from Prussia with his parents at age four, was intensely involved in progressive politics, and in 1896 took his sons to a torchlight procession for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan, {{who had come to}} Elwood during his campaign. The Willkie <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> a sidewalk fight with Republican youths, and though the Willkies won their battle, Bryan did not, defeated by former Ohio governor William McKinley. When Bryan ran again in 1900, he stayed overnight at the Willkie home, and the Democratic candidate for president became the first political hero for the boy who would later seek that office.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{visited the}} farm {{on the evening}} of Tuesday, 6 August. He told the court that his parents {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening that the boys be placed in day-time foster care with a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. The <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.|$|E

5|$|Both Ravel's {{parents were}} Roman Catholics; Marie was also {{something}} of a free-thinker, a trait inherited by her elder son, who was always politically and socially progressive in outlook in adult life. He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born. The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, Ã‰douard, was born. (He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession.) Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque heritage was a strong influence on his life and music. Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him. The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> happy childhoods.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{story about the}} {{cracking}} of the bell is that it happened when the bell was rung upon the 1835 death of the Chief Justice of the United States, John Marshall. This story originated in 1876, when the volunteer curator of Independence Hall, Colonel Frank Etting, {{announced that he had}} ascertained the truth of the story. While there is little evidence to support this view, it has been widely accepted and taught. Other claims regarding the crack in the bell include stories that it was damaged while welcoming Lafayette on his return to the United States in 1824, that it cracked announcing the passing of the British Catholic Relief Act 1829, and that some <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> been invited to ring the bell, and inadvertently damaged it. David Kimball, in his book compiled for the National Park Service, suggests that it most likely cracked sometime between 1841 and 1845, either on the Fourth of July or on Washington's Birthday.|$|E
5|$|When {{his brother}} King Edward IV died in April 1483, Richard was named Lord Protector {{of the realm}} for Edward's eldest son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Arrangements were made for Edward's {{coronation}} on 22 June 1483; but, before the young king could be crowned, the marriage of his parents was declared bigamous and therefore invalid, making their children officially illegitimate and thus barring them from inheriting the throne. On 25 June, an assembly of Lords and commoners endorsed a declaration to this effect and proclaimed Richard the rightful king. The following day, Richard III began his reign, and he was crowned on 6 July 1483. The young princes, Edward {{and his younger brother}} Richard, Duke of York, were not seen in public after August, and accusations circulated that the <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> been murdered on Richard's orders.|$|E

5|$|After {{repairs to}} the college were {{completed}} in mid-1656, the first admissions were made. The first headmaster, Richard Dutton, was appointed in 1655, and in 1665 the institution became an incorporated charity. The number of pupils grew, with admissions rising to 100 by the 1870s. Boys were admitted based on the parish they lived in, and on need, health and background of the family. Illegitimate boys were not admitted, and all <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> {{to be able to}} read to a certain standard that meant they were not hard to teach. In 1878, a new schoolroom designed by architect Alfred Waterhouse (who designed Manchester Town Hall) was built in a Tudor style. The number of boys admitted was reduced to 75 in 1908 to save money, though three years later admissions increased again to 99. In 1916, no boys were admitted due to lack of funding caused by World War I, and in 1918 the number was limited to 70. Successful public appeals resulted in the numbers rising to 97 in 1929. In 1926 a scheme was set up which allowed boys to apply for scholarships to join a grammar school, which meant that while they lived at Chetham's, they were educated elsewhere during the day. Further, they would stay at grammar school until at least the age of 16 and sometimes 18.|$|E
5|$|As {{planning}} for a potential military operation to release the captive soldiers progressed, it became clear that, {{given the number of}} West Side Boys and their separation between two locations (Gberi Bana as well as the village of Magbeni; see below), the operation could not be conducted by special forces alone. Thus, the headquarters of 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment (1 PARA) was ordered to assemble an enhanced company group, which would support special forces if such an operation was launched. The battalion's commanding officer selected A Company, led by Major Matthew Lowe, which had been on exercise in Jamaica {{at the time of the}} initial British deployment to Sierra Leone. Several members of A Company were new recruits who had only completed basic training two weeks prior. Lowe decided that replacing them with more experienced soldiers would risk undermining the cohesion and morale of the company, but several specialist units from elsewhere in 1 PARA were attached to A Company to bring the company group up to the required strength, including a signals group, snipers, heavy machine gun sections, and a mortar section. The additional firepower was included to maximise the options available to the planners, given that the West Side <b>Boys</b> <b>had</b> a numerical advantage and that additional resources would not be immediately available should the operation run into difficulties.|$|E
5|$|On 25 August 2000, {{a patrol}} from 1 R IRISH left their base in Waterloo to visit Jordanian peacekeepers {{attached}} to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and based at Masiaka. Over lunch, they were informed that the West Side <b>Boys</b> <b>had</b> begun to disarm, despite their initial reluctance, and the company commanderâ€”Major Alan Marshallâ€”decided to take the patrol to investigate en route back to their base. The patrol turned off the main road onto a dirt track {{that led to the}} village of Magbeni, where the West Side Boys were based. As they approached the base, they were surrounded by a large group of West Side Boys, who used an anti-aircraft gun mounted on a Bedford truck to block the patrol's route. Marshall dismounted his vehicle, then resisted an attempt to grab his rifle and was beaten. He {{and the rest of the}} patrol were then forced into canoes at the bank of Rokel Creak and transported to Gberi Bana, a village on the other side of the river, just upstream from the point of the initial confrontation.|$|E

25|$|On {{the second}} day of the committal {{proceedings}} Terence gave another three hours of testimony about their mistreatment. The following day he was recalled again and admitted that the <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> sometimes misbehaved and deserved to be punished. Gough had played cricket and football with them and the Goughs insisted the boys said their prayers every night. This time he said that they all ate the same food.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1910, Daniel Carter Beard and Ernest Thompson Seton had various {{arguments}} over {{who was the}} founder of Scouting. Programs for <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> been advanced by Seton in 1902, Beard in 1905 and Baden-Powell in 1907. Since Baden-Powell had based parts of the program on Seton's work, Seton {{claimed to be the}} founder. By 1915, the conflicts between them had escalated and West attempted to defuse the situation. This led directly to the creation of Horsehoe Bend Scout Ranch.|$|E
