25|$|Later in 1998, Warne was {{a member}} of Australia's touring squad of India. Finding Indian food not to his liking, he had {{spaghetti}} and <b>baked</b> <b>beans</b> flown in from Australia.

25|$|Some of {{his more}} notable oddities {{included}} a diet to supplement his extreme fitness regime, which consisted largely of tea, biscuits, and <b>baked</b> <b>beans.</b> Like his mentor, Alan Knott, a heavy tea drinker, Russell would often get through 20 cups a day.

In the final Test of the 1989 Ashes series (against Australia) at the Oval, Derek Randall counted that he used the same bag for all five days, which roughly equates to 100 cups. For lunch, Russell would eat two Weetabix, soaked for exactly eight minutes in milk, and a mashed banana. For dinner, steak and chips or chicken without skin was a favourite meal – Russell once spent every night of a Test at a Chinese restaurant in Perth, ordering cashew chicken: without the cashews.|$|E
