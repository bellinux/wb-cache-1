A newly {{developed}} multi-wire {{electrical discharge machining}} (EDM) method would accomplish the high performance slicing of silicon and silicon carbide with a narrow kerf width under a clean process environment. However, the thinner wire is challenging process with a normal round shape wire electrode. Therefore, a new wire electrode with track-shaped section was proposed {{in order to satisfy}} both the narrow kerf width and the high wire tension even in the case of thin wire electrode. In this study, the running control of wire electrode with track-shaped section was experimentally investigated, and the possibility of proposed process was discussed. A <b>brass</b> <b>coated</b> steel wire electrode with track-shaped section of aspect ratio 1 : 2 could perform the smaller vibration and the stable running up to 300 m/min.

The surface profile and wear depth of the fretted zone were measured using laser scanning microscope. The study reveals that EL Ni–B coated contacts exhibit better performance under fretting conditions. However, at conditions which are prone for severe oxidation such as, low frequency (3 Hz) or high temperature (155 °C), EL Ni–B coated contacts fail to exhibit a better stability. The quick removal of the oxide film by fretting motion, rapid oxidation of the fresh metallic particles and trapping of the oxidation products in the remaining coating, cause the contact resistance to increase to unacceptable levels at such conditions.

Some studies concentrated on qualitative compositional characterization of the metal strips, typically silver-gilt [12 - 14]. Other studies have also used SEM-EDS for quantitative compositional analyses and characterization of the layer structures of gilt-silver as well as silvered copper, and more modern metal wrappings made with <b>brass</b> <b>coated</b> copper or aluminum foil [15, 16]. While most compositional analysis of metal wrappings has been done with SEM-EDS, some have also supplemented this with wavelength dispersive X-ray spectrometry (WDS) quantitative analysis of the interiors of the metal strips to get better results on the minor elements which may be below the minimum detection limits of SEM-EDS [17]. While most metal wrapped threads use thin metal strips wrapped around a fiber core, research has also been done to characterize threads produced with strips of metal coated organic material, either cellulosic or proteinaceous based [18, 19]. While some studies have concentrated on textiles with different types of metal wrapped threads from India and Persia [12, 20, 21], the present work is the first comparative study of Indian and Persian textiles to also combine the study of the metal threads from the two cultures with dye analysis.|$|R

Owing {{to the short}} burning times of the single arcs, the erosion is restricted to the immediate neighbourhood of the ignition point, the laser focus. Hence, the cathode spots may be displayed on the cathode surface according to the displacement of the focus position. In this way, the drawbacks of conventional arc technology such as local overheating and emission of microparticles are essentially reduced.

The experiment was conducted in vitro. In the test for tearing off resistance Osteoplant implant was used as the abutment. The crown was a cast chrome- nickel substructure.
