40|$|The {{principal}} {{new point}} is that ultra-high spin of the elementary particles makes Einstein's gravity so strong, that its influence to metric is shifted from Planck to the Compton scale! Compatibility of the Kerr-Newman (KN) gravity with quantum theory is achieved by implementation of the supersymmetric Higgs model without modification of the Einstein-Maxwell gravity. We consider the nonperturbative bag-like solution to supersymmetric generalized LG field model, which creates a flat and supersymmetric vacuum state inside the bag, forming the Compton zone for consistent work of quantum theory. The bag is deformable, and its shape is controlled by BPS bound, providing compatibility of the bag boundary with external gravitational and electromagnetic (EM) field. In particular, for the spinning KN gravity the bag {{takes the form of}} oblate disk with a circular string placed on the <b>disk</b> <b>border.</b> Excitations of the KN EM field create circular traveling waves.

40|$|Context. Planetesimals {{and planets}} {{embedded}} in a circumstellar disk are dynamically perturbed by the disk gravity. It causes an apsidal line precession {{at a rate that}} depends on the disk density profile and on the distance of the massive body from the star. Aims: Different analytical models are exploited to compute the precession rate of the perihelion ϖ˙. We compare them to verify their equivalence, in particular after analytical manipulations performed to derive handy formulas, and test their predictions against numerical models in some selected cases. Methods: The theoretical precession rates were computed with analytical algorithms found in the literature using the Mathematica symbolic code, while the numerical simulations were performed with the hydrodynamical code FARGO. Results: For low-mass bodies (planetesimals) the analytical approaches described in Binney & Tremaine (2008, Galactic Dynamics, p. 96), Ward (1981, Icarus, 47, 234), and Silsbee & Rafikov (2015 a, ApJ, 798, 71) are equivalent under the same initial conditions for the disk in terms of mass, density profile, and inner and outer borders. They also match the numerical values computed with FARGO away from the outer <b>border</b> of the <b>disk</b> reasonably well. On the other hand, the predictions of the classical Mestel disk (Mestel 1963, MNRAS, 126, 553) for disks with p = 1 significantly depart from the numerical solution for radial distances beyond one-third of the disk extension because of the underlying assumption of the Mestel disk is that the outer <b>disk</b> <b>border</b> is equal to infinity. For massive bodies such as terrestrial and giant planets, the agreement of the analytical approaches is progressively poorer because of the changes in the disk structure that are induced by the planet gravity. For giant planets the precession rate changes sign and is higher than the modulus of the theoretical value by a factor ranging from 1. 5 to 1. 8. In this case, the correction of the formula proposed by Ward (1981) to account for the presence of a gap is a better approximation, at least in predicting a positive precession rate. Conclusions: Analytical modeling of the precession rate of massive bodies {{embedded in a}} circumstellar disk is accurate for planetesimals and terrestrial planets, but it becomes inaccurate when Jupiter-sized planets are considered. The changes they induce in the disk reverse the precession rate and increase it by more than 50...|$|R

40|$|We use high {{resolution}} N-body/SPH simulations {{to study the}} hydrodynamical interaction between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the hot halo of the Milky Way. We investigate whether ram-pressure acting on the satellite's ISM can explain the peculiarities observed in the HI distribution {{and the location of}} the recent star formation activity. Due to the present nearly edge-on orientation of the disk with respect to the orbital motion, compression at the leading edge can explain the high density region observed in HI at the south-east border. In the case of a face-on disk (according to Mastropietro et al. 2008 the LMC was moving almost face-on before the last perigalactic passage), ram-pressure directed perpendicularly to the disk produces a clumpy structure characterized by voids and high density filaments that resemble those observed by the Parkes HI survey. As a consequence of the very recent edge-on motion, the H-alpha emission is mainly concentrated on the eastern side where 30 Doradus and most of the supergiant shells are located, although some H-alpha complexes form a patchy distribution on the entire disk.

40|$|The Froissart () {{asymptotic}} behavior of high energy cross-sections, if considered in a parton picture, is usually {{represented as a}} kind of behavior that occurs in the process of a collision of two almost black disks, filled with partons, when radiuses of these - disks grow proportional to log's of there energies. In this article we briefly summarize the main asymptotic properties of - disks that one can expect in QCD. Then we consider if it is possible to guarantee the boost-invariance of transparency T(s,b) = 1 - σ_in(s,b), where σ_in(s,b) is the total inelastic cross-section at a definite impact parameter b, in process of collision of two such -disks. Such a question arise because the mean transverse area of the overlapping of colliding - disks, at the same impact parameter b and total energy √(s), is varying with the Lorentz frame. We show that the value of T(s,b) is not boost-invariant at some b close to the - <b>disk</b> <b>border</b> for the - disks usually expected in QCD.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of planetesimals embedded in a circumbinary protoplanetary disk. A hybrid numerical approach is developed where {{the evolution of the}} gaseous component of the disk is computed with the hydrodynamical code FARGO while the planetesimal trajectories are computed with an N-body code. The local gas density and velocity derived from the hydrodynamical portion are used to calculate the drag force and the gravitational attraction of the disk on the planetesimals. We explore the effects of spiral density wave patterns and of the disk eccentricity, both excited by the binary tidal perturbations, on the dynamical evolution of planetesimal orbits. A new definition of osculating orbital elements is given to properly account for the gravitational attraction of the disk. The outcomes of the numerical simulations show that the pericenter alignment of the planetesimal orbits is a robust result. It occurs for different values of the binary eccentricity and surface density profiles of the disk. However, the pericenters are less collimated compared to early predictions based on codes adopting a stationary and axisymmetric approximation for the disk. In addition, the eccentricity values are higher and depend on the semimajor axis of the bodies. Both these effects favor higher relative velocities between colliding planetesimals, making accretion less likely than previously thought. Small 100 m size bodies (planetesimal precursors) have a very high inward drift rate that might lead to a high-density belt in the proximity of the inner <b>border</b> of the <b>disk.</b> Fast accretion into larger bodies might occur in this region...|$|R

A 58 -year-old man is presented including the clinical and laboratory findings, cardiovascular profile and thrombophilia screening. The patient presented with 3 / 10 vision and an inferior altitudinal defect in the right eye. Funduscopic examination of the right eye revealed a hyperemic optic disk with blurred superior optic <b>disk</b> <b>border</b> and sectoral nerve fiber layer edema. Complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were normal, suggesting a NAION. A workup of cardiovascular risk factors revealed hyperlipidemia, arterial hypertension and high-risk asymptomatic coronary artery disease. Due to the family history of deep vein thrombosis in the patient’s daughter, a thrombophilia screening was additionally performed. The results revealed a double thrombophilic defect, namely congenital protein S deficiency and heterozygosity for prothrombin G 20210 A mutation, which were also identified in the patient’s daughter. Anticoagulant warfarin therapy was initiated and the patient underwent a triple bypass surgery. At three-month follow-up, the right optic disk edema had resolved, leaving a pale superior optic nerve head. Visual acuity in the right eye had slightly improved to 4 / 10; however, the dense inferior altitudinal field defect had remained unchanged.

40|$|AK Sco {{stands out}} among pre-main {{sequence}} binaries {{because of its}} prominent ultraviolet excess, the high eccentricity of its orbit and the strong tides driven by it. AK Sco consists of two F 5 type stars that get as close as 11 R_* at periastron passage. The presence of a dense (n_e ∼ 10 ^ 11 cm^- 3) extended envelope has been unveiled recently. In this article, we report the results from a XMM-Newton based monitoring of the system. We show that at periastron, X-ray and UV fluxes are enhanced {{by a factor of}} ∼ 3 with respect to the apastron values. The X-ray radiation is produced in an optically thin plasma with T∼ 6. 4 × 10 ^ 6 K and it is found that the N_H column density rises from 0. 35 × 10 ^ 21 cm^- 2 at periastron to 1. 11 × 10 ^ 21 cm^- 2 at apastron, in good agreement with previous polarimetric observations. The UV emission detected in the Optical Monitor band seems to be caused by the reprocessing of the high energy magnetospheric radiation on the circumstellar material. Further evidence of the strong magnetospheric disturbances is provided by the detection of line broadening of 278. 7 km s^- 1 in the N V line with HST/STIS. Numerical simulations of the mass flow from the circumbinary disk to the components have been carried out. They provide a consistent scenario with which to interpret AK Sco observations. We show that the eccentric orbit acts like a gravitational piston. At apastron, matter is dragged efficiently from the inner <b>disk</b> <b>border,</b> filling the inner gap and producing accretion streams that end as ring-like structures around each component of the system.

40|$|The {{topography}} of the Giardia trophozoite {{is dominated by}} the large domed sucking disk of the ventral surface. Attached to the host duodenal epithelium, the rim of this disk pene-trates the enteric surface coat and interdigitates with microvilli of the epithelial cells, approach-ing to within 20 nm of the host surface membrane. Distortion of the host brush <b>border</b> within the <b>disk</b> suggests an applied suction force. A mechanical explanation of disk action is sought in {{a detailed description of the}} fine structure of components of the ventral surface- but is found to be untenable. The disk is supported by a platform of modified 25 -nm microtubules, linked to the ventral membrane by side arms and bearing heavily cross-linked vertical dense ribbons. It is argued that such is the architecture of rigidity rather than relative movement. Around the disk a mobile cytoplasmic flange is supported by 2 lateral plates of periodic substructure. The flange has no clear mechanical role in attachment; a likely evolutionary origin from a component of the anterior axonemal axis is suggested. The cavity of the ventral disk leads posteriorly through a portal into the ventrocaudal groove: a shallow depression that houses the ventral flagella. Observation of isolated living trophozoites suggests that attachment depends on the continuing activity of the ventral flagella, which normally beat synchronously in a sinusoidal waveform. Electron micrographs confirm that this waveform is maintained in situ on the host epithelium. Of the 4 pairs of flagella, the ultrastructure of the ventral flagella is notable for additional components in the flagellar shaft, including an intraflagellar dense rod linked to 3 axonemal doublets by fine connectives. From a consideration of analogous macroscopic systems, a preliminary hydrodynamic analysis is advanced in which the suction force of attachment follows from the pattern of fluid flow induced by the beating ventral flagella. The significance of the conclusion that cytoplasmic microtubules (or structures derived from them) apparently maintain cell shape in the face of an applied external force is discussed...|$|R
