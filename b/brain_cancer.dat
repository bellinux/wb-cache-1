5|$|The National Cancer Institute {{estimated}} 22,070 {{new cases}} of primary <b>brain</b> <b>cancer</b> and 12,920 deaths due to the illness in the United State in 2009. The age-adjusted incidence rate is 6.4 per 100,000 per year, and the death rate is 4.3 per 100,000 per year. The lifetime risk of developing <b>brain</b> <b>cancer</b> for someone born today is 0.60%. Only around {{a third of those}} diagnosed with <b>brain</b> <b>cancer</b> survive for five years after diagnosis. These high overall mortality rates are a result of the prevalence of aggressive types, such as glioblastoma multiforme. Nearly 14% of new brain tumor diagnoses occur in persons under 20 years of age.|$|E
5|$|A {{brain tumor}} is an {{abnormal}} growth of cells within the brain or inside the skull, {{and can be}} cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just over half of all primary brain tumors are malignant; the rest are benign, though they may still be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic <b>brain</b> <b>cancer</b> is over six times more common than primary <b>brain</b> <b>cancer,</b> as it occurs in about 10â€“30% of all people with cancer.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{intensive}} therapy regimen, <b>brain</b> <b>cancers</b> {{present with}} a poor prognosis, {{with an estimated}} median survival time of less than 15 months in case of glioblastoma. Early detection and improved surgical resections are suggested to enhance prognosis; several tools are being explored to achieve the purpose. Raman spectroscopy (RS), a nondestructive and noninvasive technique, has been extensively explored in <b>brain</b> <b>cancers.</b> This review summarizes RS-based studies in <b>brain</b> <b>cancers,</b> categorized into studies on animal models, ex vivo human samples, and in vivo human subjects. Findings suggest RS as a promising tool which can aid in improving the accuracy of brain tumor surgery. Further advancements in instrumentation, market-assessment, and clinical trials can facilitate translation of the technology as a noninvasive intraoperative guidance tool...|$|R

40|$|Treatment of <b>brain</b> <b>cancers,</b> {{especially}} high grade gliomas (WHO stage III and IV) is slowly making progress, {{but not as}} fast as medical researchers and the patients would like. Immunotherapy offers the opportunity to allow the patient's own immune system a chance to help eliminate the cancer. Immunotherapy's strength is that it efficiently treats relatively small tumors in experimental animal models. For some patients, immunotherapy has worked for them while not showing long-term toxicity. In this paper, we will trace the history of immunotherapy for <b>brain</b> <b>cancers.</b> We will also highlight some of the possible directions that this field may be taking {{in the immediate future}} for improving this therapeutic option...|$|R

40|$|Cancer {{stem cells}} (CSC) are {{considered}} to be a major driver of cancer progression and successful therapies must control CSCs. However, CSC are often less sensitive to treatment and they might survive radiation and/or chemotherapies. In this paper we combine radiation treatment with differentiation therapy. During differentiation therapy, a differentiation promoting agent is supplied (e. g. TGF-beta) such that CSCs differentiate and become more radiosensitive. Then radiation can be used to control them. We consider three types of cancer: head and neck <b>cancer,</b> <b>brain</b> <b>cancers</b> (primary tumors and metastatic <b>brain</b> <b>cancers),</b> and breast cancer; and we use mathematical modelling to show that combination therapy of the above type can have a large beneficial effect for the patient; increasing treatment success and reducing side effects...|$|R

5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is toxic, and {{ingestion}} {{may lead}} to acute lead poisoning, as is applicable for all soluble lead compounds. All inorganic lead compounds are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as probably carcinogenic to humans (Category2A). They {{have been linked to}} renal cancer and glioma in experimental animals and to renal cancer, <b>brain</b> <b>cancer</b> and lung cancer in humans, although studies of workers exposed to lead are often complicated by concurrent exposure to arsenic. Lead is known to substitute for zinc in a number of enzymes, including Î´-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (porphobilinogen synthase) in the haem biosynthetic pathway and pyrimidine-5â€²-nucleotidase, important for the correct metabolism of DNA and can therefore cause fetal damage.|$|E

Hardy played baseball as a child, but had to stop after he crashed during a motocross race, injuring his arm. He also played football during high school as a fullback and linebacker. He briefly competed in amateur wrestling in high school. He had to stop playing football in high school, after he was ordered to pick between professional wrestling and football, and he chose wrestling. Hardy's favorite subjects in school were U.S. history and art, which he did for extra credit.|$|E
5|$|Orr {{has been}} known to be {{fiercely}} loyal to former Bruin personnel and teammates. When Derek Sanderson had alcohol and prescription drug-abuse problems and wound up penniless, Orr spent his own money to ensure that Sanderson successfully completed rehab. Decades later, Orr and Sanderson went into business together managing finances for hockey players. Orr also helped out Bruins trainer John (Frosty) Forristall, his roommate during his first years with the Bruins, who had just been fired from the Tampa Bay Lightning for alcoholism in 1994. Forristall's drinking put him on bad terms with his brother John, so he returned to Boston jobless and soon afterwards was diagnosed with <b>brain</b> <b>cancer.</b> Orr took Forristall into his home for a year until he {{died at the age of}} 51. Orr was a pallbearer at his funeral.|$|E

40|$|Neural {{stem cells}} (NSCs) are self-renewing {{multipotent}} cells that generate the main phenotypes {{of the nervous}} system, neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. As such they hold the promise to treat {{a broad range of}} neurological diseases and injuries. Neural progenitor and stem cells have been isolated and characterized in vitro, from adult, fetal and post-mortem tissues, providing sources of material for cellular therapy. However, NSCs are still elusive cells and remain to be unequivocally identified and characterized, limiting their potential use for therapy. Neural progenitor and stem cells, isolated and cultured in vitro, can be genetically modified and when transplanted migrate to tumor sites in the brain. These intrinsic properties of neural progenitor and stem cells provide tremendous potential to bolster the translation of NSC research to therapy. It is proposed to combine gene therapy and cellular therapy to treat <b>brain</b> <b>cancers.</b> Hence, neural progenitor and stem cells provide new opportunities for the treatment of <b>brain</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R
