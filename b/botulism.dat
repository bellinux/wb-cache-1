5|$|<b>Botulism,</b> {{acquired}} by eating infected fish, {{can lead to}} paralysis and drowning. Aspergillosis is another cause of emaciation and death. Outbreaks sometimes lead to thousands of deaths.|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{bacteriology}} in the 20th century increased {{the sophistication of}} possible bio-agents in war. Biological sabotage—in the form of anthrax and glanders—was undertaken {{on behalf of the}} Imperial German government during World War I, with indifferent results. In World War II, Britain weaponised tularemia, anthrax, brucellosis, and <b>botulism</b> toxins, but never used them.|$|E
5|$|It is {{susceptible}} {{to a range of}} parasites including Cryptosporidium, Giardia, tapeworms, blood parasites and external feather lice, and is also affected by other avian diseases. It is often the dominant species in major mortality events from avian <b>botulism</b> and avian cholera, and can also contract avian influenza, the H5N1 strain of which is highly pathogenic and occasionally infects humans.|$|E
5|$|Dr Eric Underwood {{began his}} {{research}} at Avondale in the mid-1930s also utilising the sheep flocks. Underwood's initial research was into {{the effects of}} sulfur on wool growth, he followed that research with investigations into <b>botulism</b> in sheep during 1935. These experiments were {{the first of many}} by Underwood over the next 30 years. During the 1940s he studied the nutritional value of hay and pasture for sheep, the ongoing results from these Studies in Cereal Hay production in Western Australia were published in the Journal of Agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{from the}} Pleistocene {{suggest that this}} species bred further south in Europe in the cool periods between glaciations than it does now. Its {{sensitivity}} to changing climate {{as well as to}} water table levels and the speed of vegetation growth has led to suggestions that its range is affected by global warming, and the ruff might act as an indicator species for monitoring climate change. Potential threats to this species may also include outbreaks of diseases to which it is susceptible such as influenza, <b>botulism</b> and avian malaria.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{following}} the major decline in brown pelican numbers in Louisiana from DDT poisoning, 500 pelicans were imported from Florida to augment and re-establish the population; over 300 subsequently died in April and May 1975 from poisoning by the pesticide endrin. About 14,000 pelicans, including 7500 American white pelicans, perished from <b>botulism</b> after eating {{fish from the}} Salton Sea in 1990. In 1991 abnormal numbers of brown pelicans and Brandt's cormorants died at Santa Cruz, California, when their food fish (anchovies) were contaminated with neurotoxic domoic acid, produced by the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia.|$|E
5|$|Pintails in North America {{at least}} have been badly {{affected}} by avian diseases, with the breeding population falling from more than 10 million in 1957 to 3.5 million by 1964. Although the species has recovered from that low point, the breeding population in 1999 was 30% below the long-term average, despite years of major efforts focused on restoring the species. In 1997, an estimated 1.5million water birds, the majority being northern pintails, died from avian <b>botulism</b> during two outbreaks in Canada and Utah.|$|E
5|$|Haylage, {{also known}} as Round bale silage is a term for grass sealed in {{airtight}} plastic bags, a form of forage that is frequently fed in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, but is not often seen in the United States. Because haylage {{is a type of}} silage, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage. Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale. If a rodent dies inside the plastic, the subsequent <b>botulism</b> toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of non-infectious causes of {{inflammation}} of the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the more common include medications (like NSAIDs), certain foods such as lactose (in those who are intolerant), and gluten (in those with celiac disease). Crohn's disease is also a non-infectious source of (often severe) gastroenteritis. Disease secondary to toxins may also occur. Some food-related conditions associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea include: ciguatera poisoning due to consumption of contaminated predatory fish, scombroid associated with the consumption of certain types of spoiled fish, tetrodotoxin poisoning from the consumption of puffer fish among others, and <b>botulism</b> typically due to improperly preserved food.|$|E
5|$|Unknown biotoxins, pathogens, and the {{impairment}} of feather waterproofing {{can lead to}} hypothermia and avian cholera. Since this grebe usually winters on the coast, it is also vulnerable to oil pollution. Large-scaled deaths (such as 150,000 birds on the Salton Sea in 1992) from erysipelas, avian cholera and avian <b>botulism</b> have been recorded {{in the past and}} could threaten the species. These and other factors, such as human disturbance, including collisions with power transmission lines, contribute to declining populations in certain areas. This species used to be threatened in North America by the millinery industry, which helped facilitate the hunting of the birds, and egg collectors. Although this is true, this grebe is hunted in the Gilan Province in Iran, for both commercial and recreational purposes. However, there is no evidence suggesting that these threats could result in a significant risk for the overall population.|$|E
25|$|<b>Botulism</b> is {{generally}} treated with <b>botulism</b> antitoxin and supportive care.|$|E
25|$|In the United States {{an average}} of 145 cases are {{reported}} each year. Of these, roughly 65% are infant <b>botulism,</b> 20% are wound <b>botulism,</b> and 15% are foodborne. Infant <b>botulism</b> is predominantly sporadic and not associated with epidemics, but great geographic variability exists. From 1974 to 1996, for example, 47% of all infant <b>botulism</b> cases reported in the U.S. occurred in California.|$|E
25|$|The {{paralysis}} {{caused by}} <b>botulism</b> can persist for 2 to 8 weeks, during which supportive care and ventilation {{may be necessary}} to keep the person alive. <b>Botulism</b> is fatal in 5% to 10% of people who are affected. However, if left untreated, <b>botulism</b> is fatal in 40% to 50% of cases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Botulism</b> {{can occur}} in many {{vertebrates}} and invertebrates. <b>Botulism</b> {{has been reported in}} rats, mice, chicken, frogs, toads, goldfish, aplysia, squid, crayfish, drosophila, leeches, etc.|$|E
25|$|<b>Botulism</b> {{can result}} in death due to {{respiratory}} failure. However, in the past 50 years, the proportion of patients with <b>botulism</b> who die has fallen from about 50% to 7% due to improved supportive care. A patient with severe <b>botulism</b> may require mechanical ventilation (breathing support through a ventilator) as well as intensive medical and nursing care, sometimes for several months. The respiratory failure and paralysis that occur with severe <b>botulism</b> may require a person {{to be on a}} breathing machine (ventilator) for weeks or months. The person may require rehabilitation therapy after leaving the hospital.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} cases of food borne and infant <b>botulism</b> has changed little in recent years, but wound <b>botulism</b> has {{increased}} because of the use of black tar heroin, especially in California.|$|E
25|$|In adults, <b>botulism</b> can {{be treated}} by passive {{immunization}} with a horse-derived antitoxin, which blocks {{the action of the}} toxin circulating in the blood. A trivalent antitoxin containing antibodies raised against botulinum toxin types A, B, and E is used most commonly, however a heptavalent <b>botulism</b> antitoxin has also been developed and was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2013. In infants, horse-derived antitoxin is sometimes avoided for fear of infants developing serum sickness or lasting hypersensitivity to horse-derived proteins. To avoid this, a human-derived antitoxin has been developed and approved by the U.S. FDA in 2003 for the treatment of infant <b>botulism.</b> This human-derived antitoxin {{has been shown to be}} both safe and effective for the treatment of infant <b>botulism.</b> However, the danger of equine-derived antitoxin to infants has not been clearly established, and one study showed the equine-derived antitoxin to be both safe and effective for the treatment of infant <b>botulism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Honey is a known dietary {{reservoir}} of C. botulinum spores {{and has been}} linked to infant <b>botulism.</b> For this reason honey is not recommended for infants less than one year of age. Most cases of infant <b>botulism,</b> however, are thought to be caused by acquiring the spores from the natural environment. Clostridium botulinum is a ubiquitous soil-dwelling bacterium. Many infant <b>botulism</b> patients have been demonstrated to live near a construction site or an area of soil disturbance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Botulism</b> has {{occurred}} after cosmetic use of inappropriate strengths of Botox.|$|E
25|$|Globally, <b>botulism</b> {{is fairly}} rare, with {{approximately}} 1,000 cases yearly.|$|E
25|$|Wound <b>botulism</b> {{results from}} the {{contamination}} of a wound with the bacteria, which then secrete the toxin into the bloodstream. This has become more common in intravenous drug users since the 1990s, especially people using black tar heroin and those injecting heroin into the skin rather than the veins. Wound <b>botulism</b> accounts for 29% of cases.|$|E
25|$|Infants {{can develop}} <b>botulism</b> after {{consuming}} honey contaminated with Clostridium botulinum endospores.|$|E
25|$|Isolated {{cases of}} <b>botulism</b> have been {{described}} after inhalation by laboratory workers.|$|E
25|$|Infant <b>botulism</b> has no {{long-term}} side effects, {{but can be}} complicated by hospital-acquired infections.|$|E
25|$|Physicians may {{consider}} diagnosing <b>botulism</b> if the patient's history and physical examination suggest <b>botulism.</b> However, these clues {{are often not}} enough to allow a diagnosis. Other diseases such as Guillain–Barré syndrome, stroke, and myasthenia gravis can appear similar to <b>botulism,</b> and special tests {{may be needed to}} exclude these other conditions. These tests may include a brain scan, cerebrospinal fluid examination, nerve conduction test (electromyography, or EMG), and an edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) test for myasthenia gravis. A definite diagnosis can be made if botulinum toxin is identified in the food, stomach or intestinal contents, vomit or feces. The toxin is occasionally found in the blood in peracute cases. Botulinum toxin can be detected by a variety of techniques, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), electrochemiluminescent (ECL) tests and mouse inoculation or feeding trials. The toxins can be typed with neutralization tests in mice. In toxicoinfectious <b>botulism,</b> the organism can be cultured from tissues. On egg yolk medium, toxin-producing colonies usually display surface iridescence that extends beyond the colony.|$|E
25|$|From 1958–1983 {{there were}} 986 {{outbreaks}} of <b>botulism</b> in China involving 4,377 people with 548 deaths.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} the spores {{releases}} botulinum toxin, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream and taken throughout the body, causing paralysis by blocking the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Typical symptoms of infant <b>botulism</b> include constipation, lethargy, weakness, difficulty feeding and an altered cry, often progressing to a complete descending flaccid paralysis. Although constipation is usually the first symptom of infant <b>botulism,</b> it is commonly overlooked.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} has {{demonstrated}} an effective vaccine against cattle <b>botulism</b> associated with Clostridium botulinum serotypes C and D.|$|E
25|$|Pigs are {{relatively}} resistant to <b>botulism.</b> Reported symptoms include anorexia, refusal to drink, vomiting, pupillary dilation, and muscle paralysis.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, {{there were}} 70 cases of <b>botulism</b> with 8 deaths in Ukraine. The {{previous}} {{year there were}} 115 cases with 12 deaths.|$|E
25|$|Infant <b>botulism</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} in 49 of 50 US states, and cases have been recognized in 26 countries on five continents.|$|E
25|$|Between March 31 and April 6, 1977, 59 {{individuals}} developed type B <b>botulism.</b> All ill persons {{had eaten}} {{at the same}} Mexican restaurant in Pontiac, Michigan and all had consumed a hot sauce made with improperly home-canned jalapeño peppers, either by adding it to their food, or by eating a nacho that had had hot sauce used in its preparation. The full clinical spectrum (mild symptomatology with neurologic findings through life-threatening ventilatory paralysis) of type B <b>botulism</b> was documented.|$|E
25|$|Infant <b>botulism</b> {{typically}} has {{no long-term}} side effects {{but can be}} complicated by treatment associated adverse events. The case fatality rate is less than 1% for hospitalized babies.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} form in Western {{countries}} is infant <b>botulism.</b> This occurs in infants who are colonized with the bacterium in the small intestine {{during the early stages}} of their lives. The bacterium then produces the toxin, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. The consumption of honey {{during the first year of}} life has been identified as a risk factor for infant botulism; it is a factor in a fifth of all cases. The adult form of infant <b>botulism</b> is termed adult intestinal toxemia, and is exceedingly rare.|$|E
25|$|The spores require warm temperatures, {{a protein}} source, an {{anaerobic}} environment, and moisture {{in order to}} become active and produce toxin. In the wild, decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the <b>botulism</b> bacteria to activate and produce toxin that may affect feeding birds and other animals. Spores are not killed by boiling, but <b>botulism</b> is uncommon because special, rarely obtained conditions are necessary for botulinum toxin production from C. botulinum spores, including an anaerobic, low-salt, low-acid, low-sugar environment at ambient temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Improper canning of low-acid meats, e.g., snails, {{involves}} {{a risk of}} <b>botulism.</b> When canning snails for home consumption, carefully follow canning instructions for low-acid meats to prevent food poisoning.|$|E
