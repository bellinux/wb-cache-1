500|$|Experience in Vietnam {{demonstrated}} {{the need for}} a better visual and <b>blind</b> <b>bombing</b> capability. In March 1968, the Air Force ordered development of an upgraded bombing/navigation system, incorporating a Singer-General Precision inertial navigation system, improvements to the AN/APN-131 navigation radar, and solid-state circuitry for the R-14A radar, which was redesignated R-14K. Furthermore, the digital AN/ARN-92 long-range navigation receiver replaced the problematic AN/ARN-85 receiver. The additional avionics were housed in a long, raised dorsal spine. The modified bombing/navigation system was known as Thunderstick II. [...] F-105s with this system could achieve a bombing circular error of probability (CEP) of [...] from an altitude of [...] Although the first Thunderstick II aircraft flew in 1969, they were not used in Vietnam.

British fighters also attacked other German ships and facilities in the Kaafjord area, damaging two patrol boats, a minesweeper and a radar station, as well as destroying an ammunition dump and three guns of an anti-aircraft battery. Tirpitzs last remaining Arado Ar 196 seaplane was attacked in Bukta harbour and damaged beyond repair. Four Corsairs and two Hellcats were shot down during the raid, and the battleship's crew suffered 8 fatalities and 18 men wounded. Casualties among the anti-aircraft units stationed around Kaafjord were heavy.|$|R
500|$|USAAF patrols {{made contact}} with the Completion Force on 12February; {{following}} this, it was tracked almost continuously by radar-equipped Army Air Forces and U.S.Navy aircraft. On the morning of 13February, a force of B-24 Liberator heavy bombers and 40 B-25 Mitchell medium bombers escorted by 48 P-51 Mustang fighters was dispatched from several bases on the islands of Leyte and Mindoro to attack the Japanese ships. While the aircraft successfully rendezvoused near the Completion Force, heavy cloud cover kept them from spotting any of the ships. As radar-directed <b>blind</b> <b>bombing</b> was prohibited to avoid accidental attacks on the Allied submarines in the area, the strike force returned to its bases without attacking. On the same day, the Australian destroyers [...] and [...] departed Lingayen Gulf and proceeded to a position about [...] west of Manila where they were held in readiness to rescue the crews of any aircraft downed while attacking the Completion Force.|$|E
500|$|The {{final two}} raids {{conducted}} by XXBomber Command before it deployed to the Marianas targeted oil storage facilities on {{islands in the}} Singapore area. On 12March, three B-29 groups were dispatched to attack Bukom and Sebarok islands just off the south coast of Singapore as well as Samboe Island, which is a few miles south near Batam Island in the Dutch East Indies. Each of the groups was assigned a different island and no Japanese anti-aircraft guns or fighters were encountered. Despite this, poor weather meant that the 44 B-29s which reached the target area had to use <b>blind</b> <b>bombing</b> techniques and their attacks caused little damage. The command's final attack before it departed for the Marianas {{took place on the}} night of 29/30March when 29 Superfortresses were sent to attack Bukom Island. In order to train the aircrew for the low-level tactics which were being used against the Japanese home islands, the bombers attacked their targets individually from altitudes between [...] and [...] This raid destroyed seven of the 49 oil tanks in the island, and a further three were damaged.

2500|$|Before 1930, Hispano-Suiza {{had built}} {{aircraft}} designed elsewhere and from 1928 had produced metal framed Nieuport-Delage 52 fighters for the Aviación Militar. This contract {{encouraged them to}} design an intermediate military trainer to prepare Spanish pilots for the Nieuport and also to provide advanced training for <b>blind</b> flying, gunnery, <b>bombing,</b> photo-reconnaissance and wireless operation. It was also to be suitable for liaison duties. The resulting aircraft was called the E-30, where E stood for Escuela (in English, [...] training) and the 30 was from the design year of 1930. It was a single engine, parasol wing monoplane, seating two in tandem.|$|R

50|$|Secord's {{responsibilities}} as a one-man logistics and operations staff covered {{a wide range}} of duties. One of the first duties he assumed was defense of Lima Site 85. In early 1967, General Hunter Harris briefed Secord and Lair on the upgrading of the TACAN installation there with guidance radar. The location, nearly on the Lao border with northern Vietnam, would enable American strike aircraft to follow its radar beam to Hanoi or Vinh and drop their <b>bombs</b> <b>blind,</b> regardless of weather. Lair and Secord were tasked with defense of the site. Despite their best efforts, this site would be overrun in March 1968. Secord requested additional protection for the sheep-dipped technicians. Ambassador William H. Sullivan, who supervised the war in Laos by presidential directive, denied the need for stationing Green Berets at the site, or for personal weaponry. However, Secord insubordinately issued small arms to the onsite technicians for self-defense.|$|R
5000|$|The last Zeppelin raid on Britain {{took place}} on 5 August 1918, when four Zeppelins bombed targets in the Midlands and the North of England. The {{airships}} reached the British coast before dark and were sighted by the Leman Tail lightship 30 mi north-east of Happisburgh at 20:10, although defending aircraft were not alerted until 20:50. Despite thick cloud, two aircraft intercepted the recently commissioned L 70, which was carrying Strasser as an observer, and shot it down in flames. Egbert Cadbury and Robert Leckie flying a DH.4 were credited with the victory. [...] The remaining airships dropped their <b>bombs</b> <b>blind,</b> relying on radio bearings for navigational information and none fell on land. An {{attempt was made to}} salvage the wreckage of L 70 and most of the structure was brought ashore, providing the British a great deal of technical information. The bodies of the crew members were buried at sea.|$|R
50|$|SHORAN, which {{operates}} at 300 MHz, requires an airborne AN/APN-3 set and two AN/CPN-2 or 2A ground stations. The {{equipment on board}} the aircraft includes a transmitter, a receiver, an operator's console and a K-1A model bombing computer. The transmitter sends pulses {{to one of the}} ground stations and the system calculates the range in statute miles by clocking the elapsed time between transmitter pulse and the returned signal. The system was intended for use in navigation, but it became obvious that it would work well for <b>blind</b> targeting during <b>bombing</b> runs in poor visibility. The setup made up of the K-1A bombing computer combined with the navigation system was the first SHORAN. The SHORAN system is designed so that as the aircraft faces the target, the low-frequency station should be on the left, and the high-frequency station is on the right. This allows the computer to triangulate the two stations and the target.|$|R
50|$|After the {{invasion}} of Normandy, Bomber Command joined in the campaign against German oil targets. Although daylight bombing against targets within Germany itself still incurred too many casualties closer targets could be attacked by day with fighter escorts. 3 Group carried out <b>blind</b> <b>bombing</b> techniques by day using G-H.|$|E
50|$|The Pathfinders were target-marking squadrons in RAF Bomber Command during World War II. They {{located and}} marked targets with flares, which a main bomber force could aim at, {{increasing}} {{the accuracy of}} their bombing. The Pathfinders were normally the first to receive new <b>blind</b> <b>bombing</b> aids like Gee, Oboe and the H2S radar.|$|E
50|$|Building {{on their}} lead in radar and their {{experience}} with the Battle of the Beams, RAF Bomber Command developed a variety of devices to enable precision strategic bombing. Gee and Oboe were beam-riding <b>blind</b> <b>bombing</b> aids, while H2S was the first airborne ground-scanning radar system - enabling improved navigation to a target and bombing at night and through cloud if necessary. These {{could be used in}} conjunction with Pathfinder bombers to guarantee accurate strikes on targets in all weathers.|$|E

After the war he {{directed}} investigations in the Basic Research Division of TRE on the detection and properties of infra-red and millimetre-wave radiation. He also made very accurate measurements of propagation velocity of electro-magnetic radiation at radio frequencies and studied applications of radar in meteorology. He became Deputy Head of the Division (later renamed the Physics Department, Royal Radar Establishment) ...|$|E
50|$|During Minuteman's early development, the Air Force {{maintained}} {{the policy that}} the manned strategic bomber was the primary weapon of nuclear war. <b>Blind</b> <b>bombing</b> accuracy {{on the order of}} 1500 feet km was expected, and the weapons were sized to ensure even the hardest targets would be destroyed as long as the weapon fell within this range. The USAF had enough bombers to attack every military and industrial target in the USSR and was confident that its bombers would survive in great enough numbers that such a strike would utterly destroy the country.|$|E
50|$|The beacon {{system was}} {{widely used in}} the post-war era for <b>blind</b> <b>bombing</b> systems. Of {{particular}} note were systems used by the US Marines that allowed the signal to be delayed {{in such a way}} to offset the drop point. These systems allowed the troops at the front line to direct the aircraft to points in front of them, directing fire on the enemy. Beacons were widely used for temporary or mobile navigation as well, as the transponder systems were generally small and low-powered, able to be man portable or mounted on a Jeep.|$|E
50|$|In the Second World War the Lorenz beam {{principle}} {{was used}} by the German Luftwaffe as the basis of a number of <b>blind</b> <b>bombing</b> aids, notably Knickebein ('crooked leg') and the X-Gerät ('X-Apparatus'), in their bombing offensive against English cities during the winter of 1940/41. Knickebein was very similar to LFF, modifying it only slightly to be more highly directional and work over much longer distance. Using the same frequencies allowed their bombers to use the already-installed LFF receivers, although a second receiver was needed in order to pinpoint a single location.|$|E
50|$|Oboe was a British aerial <b>blind</b> <b>bombing</b> {{targeting}} {{system in}} World War II, based on radio transponder technology. The system {{consisted of a}} pair of radio transmitters on the ground, which sent signals which were received and retransmitted by a transponder in the aircraft. By comparing the time each signal took to reach the aircraft, the distance between the aircraft and the station could be determined. The Oboe operators then sent radio signals to the aircraft to bring them onto their target and properly time the release of their bombs.|$|E
50|$|In 1940 during World War II {{and while}} still an undergraduate, Sir Herbert was {{recruited}} by C P Snow {{to work on}} the newly established Chain Home radar system and he was later commissioned into the technical branch of the RAF Volunteer Reserve on 24 Oct 1941. He also became involved in the calibration of the Oboe <b>blind</b> <b>bombing</b> system and GEE navigation system. Towards the end of the war, he moved to India to establish a GEE network there, before serving as aide-de-camp to Air Marshal Sir Hugh Walmsley, then Air Officer Commander-in-Chief, RAF India.|$|E

5000|$|Number 3 and 4 groups RAF {{targeted}} the development works, and at 00:48, a backer-up accurately placed a green flare load {{in the heart}} of the development works for the third wave by No. 5 Group and No. 6 Group, and a few bombloads caused serious laboratory and office damage. As during the Operation Bellicose raid, <b>blind</b> <b>bombing</b> after a timed run had been planned from Rügen in case of smoke concealing the green target indicator. However, the Lancasters and Halifaxes flew 20 or even 30 seconds past the timing point to the visible and inaccurate green markers from the six [...] "shifters" [...] and three backers-up, their bombs landing 2000 - 3000 yd beyond the development works in the concentration camp. At 00:55, due to timing errors, 35 straggler aircraft were still waiting to bomb.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{invasion}} of France by Germany in 1940, Reeves escaped over the Spanish border and then {{made his way back}} to England aboard a cargo ship. He joined the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough and took part in the development of countermeasures against the German radio navigation systems, the so-called 'battle of the beams'. Reeves was later transferred to the Telecommunications Research Establishment as part of a team of scientists and engineers developing Britain's own radio navigation aids. The first system they developed was called 'GEE', a system that performed well, but was susceptible to jamming and was not accurate enough for <b>blind</b> <b>bombing</b> of targets at night or through thick cloud. Together with Frank Jones of the Telecommunications Research Establishment, Reeves developed a new system called 'Oboe', which offered pin-point accuracy to within 50 yds (45m), and was resistant to jamming. 'Oboe' was to prove invaluable to the Royal Air Force, during Bomber Command's offensive against Germany.|$|E
