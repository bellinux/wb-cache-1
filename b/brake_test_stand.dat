40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research results}} {{on a new}} fluid-mechatronic brake principle. The Self-energizing Electro-Hydraulic Brake (SEHB) utilizes the effect of instable self-reinforcement in combination with a closed loop control. Background {{for the development of}} the brake concept is a train application. However, SEHB is not limited to any specific application. Main advantages of the concept are its minimal energy consumption, the closed loop control of the true brake torque and its feedback ability due to the decentralized low-power electronic control. This thesis introduces the new brake principle by comparing it to conventional self-reinforcing brakes. A mathematical distinction is given between self-reinforcement and self-energization on the basis of static considerations. The dynamic characteristics are analyzed using a linearized system description which is further simplified using the method of pole dominance analysis. The simplified model is used to calculate a state dependent proportional controller map on the basis of a damping criteria. Besides the theoretic analysis, the thesis presents the basic hydraulic design criteria and gives a systematic overview over different hydraulic-mechanical design solutions. A special focus is given on the valve control, since it is vital for the brake performance. Different automotive valves such as from antilock brake systems (ABS) or electronic stabilization programs (ESP) are applied using electronic power switches and current drivers. The <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> and two successive prototypes are outlined at the end of this thesis. Different exemplary measurement results show the performance of the implemented types of valve control and demonstrate the potential of this new brake technology...|$|E
40|$|Mineral oil {{and other}} {{lubricants}} are commonly {{applied to the}} gauge corner of high rails to avoid wheel/rail interface wear on railways. Although not directly applied {{to the top of}} the rail, these lubricants sometimes end up on this surface, and the relatively low coefficient of friction they produce can cause slipping or sliding at the wheel/rail interface during vehicle acceleration or braking. It has been reported in the literature that the application of traction fluid (a modern technique involving the use of a synthetic lubricant) produced a higher coefficient of friction than that of a conventional wheel/rail interface lubricant. In this study, tests were performed using traction fluid to evaluate its influence on a vehicle’s braking distance and other important performance elements from a practical point of view. The results of the braking perform-ance evaluation carried out on a <b>braking</b> <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> showed that the braking distance increase with synthetic traction fluids was roughly one-half of that observed with conventional wheel/rail lubrication oil. This suggests the potential of using traction fluid as a wheel/rail lubricant...|$|R
40|$|Wheel slide {{protection}} devices (WSPD) {{are destined to}} avoid important sliding of wheels during braking actions in case of temporarily impaired wheel-rail adhesion by correspondent reductions of air pressure in brake cylinders. Accordingly, longer braking distances and higher longitudinal in-train forces occur, potentially affecting the traffic safety and the passengers comfort. A general analyse and evaluation of these effects are the main targets of the present study. The theoretical considerations are sustained by simulations of braking process, considering situations of normal, respectively diminished wheel-rail adhesion determining random actuations of WSPD. The air pressure evolution in brake cylinders of was experimentally determined on a computerized <b>brake</b> system <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> and adequately used as input in simulations. The results indicate an increase of in-train forces and a more complex evolution of the longitudinal dynamic actions between the vehicles {{in the case of}} degraded wheel-rail adhesion, when the random actuation of WSPD have major influence in the whole braking process...|$|R
40|$|During braking, {{both the}} disc and pads in disc brakes are worn. Since disc brakes are not sealed,some of the wear {{particles}} generated can become airborne. Several {{studies have found}} anassociation between adverse health effects and the concentration of particles in the atmosphere,so it is of interest to improve {{our knowledge of the}} airborne wear particles generated by discbrakes. This thesis deals with experimental and computational methods focusing on airborne wearparticles from disc brakes. The eight appended papers discuss the possibility to both measure andnumerically determine the concentration and size distribution of airborne wear particles thatoriginate from the pad-to-disc contact. The objective is to increase the scientific knowledge ofairborne wear particles generated from disc brakes. Papers A, B and C describe <b>tests</b> of disc <b>brake</b> materials conducted in a modified pin-on-discmachine. The results show that the test set-up can be used to measure and rank disc brakematerials with respect to the concentration of airborne particles generated. Ultrafine (nanosized),fine and coarse airborne wear particles that contain metals such as iron, copper and tin werefound. Papers D and E describe a novel disc <b>brake</b> assembly <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> and <b>tests</b> of disc <b>brake</b> materialsconducted in it. The results show that the test set-up can be used to measure the concentrationand size distribution of airborne wear particles generated from disc brake materials. The resultsalso indicate an ability to rank different pad/disc combinations with respect to the concentrationof airborne wear particles. Furthermore, the results suggest that this <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> can be used tostudy rust layer removal from the disc and that airborne particles are generated even at low brakepressures, such as used to remove dirt from the disc. Paper F compares measurements made in passenger car field tests with measurements made in adisc <b>brake</b> assembly <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> and in a pin-on-disc machine. A promising correlation between thethree different test methods is found. Paper G presents and discusses a simulation methodology that numerically determines theconcentration and size distribution of airborne wear particles generated from the pad-to-disccontact in disc brakes by using general-purpose finite element software. Paper H discusses a cellular automaton model that describes the microscopic contact situationbetween the pad and disc in disc brakes. This model is used to numerically determine the amountof wear that leaves the contact. The results correlate qualitatively with experimental observationsfound in the literature. QC 2011031...|$|R
40|$|During braking, {{both the}} rotor and the pads in disc brakes are worn. Since disc brakes are not sealed, {{some of the}} wear {{particles}} generated can become airborne. Several studies have found an association between adverse health effects and the concentration of particles in the atmosphere, so it is of interest to improve {{our knowledge of the}} airborne wear particles generated by disc brakes. However, in field tests it is difficult to distinguish these particles from others in the surrounding environment, so it may be preferable to use laboratory <b>test</b> <b>stands</b> and/or simulation models to study the amount of airborne wear particles generated. This thesis deals with a simulation methodology for prediction of airborne wear particles from disc brakes and three experimental methods for <b>testing</b> disc <b>brake</b> materials with focus on airborne wear particles. The four appended papers discuss the possibility to both measure and predict the number and size distribution of airborne wear particles that originate from the pad to rotor contact. The objective is to develop a simulation methodology that predicts the number and size distribution of airborne wear particles from disc brakes. Paper A describes how a modified pin-on-disc machine was used to study airborne wear particles originating from different disc brake materials. The results indicate that the test setup can be used to measure and rank the number concentration and size distribution of the airborne wear particles generated. Paper B describes a disc <b>brake</b> assembly <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> for measurements of airborne wear particles from disc brakes. The results indicate that the test setup can be used to measure the number concentration and size distribution of airborne wear particles generated from disc brake materials. The results also indicate a promising ability to rank different pad/rotor material combinations with respect to the number concentration of airborne wear particles. Paper C compares measurements made in passenger car field tests with measurements made in a disc <b>brake</b> assembly <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> and in a pin-on-disc machine. A promising correlation between the three different test methods is found. Paper D presents a simulation methodology for predicting the number and size distribution of airborne wear particles using finite element analysis (FEA). The simulated number distribution is compared with experimental measurements at component level. The result indicates that the proposed methodology may be used to predict the number concentration and size distribution of airborne particles generated in the pad-to-rotor contact...|$|R

40|$|Most modern {{passenger}} cars have disc brakes {{on the front}} wheels, which unlike drum brakes are not sealed off to the ambient air. During braking, there is wear to both the rotor and the pads. This wear process generates particles, which may become airborne. A problem with measuring airborne wear particles in field tests is to distinguish them from the background noise. Therefore, a disc <b>brake</b> laboratory <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> that allows control of the cleanness of the surrounding air is used. With this <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> the number {{and size of the}} airborne wear particles from the pad to rotor contact can be measured online. In this technical report the results from two test series is presented. The first series were preformed at three brake cylinder pressure levels (1. 2, 1. 7 and 2. 2 bar) and the rotors were pre-conditioned in a climate chamber with an oxide layer (e. g. rust). Ceramic NAO, NAO and low metallic type <b>brake</b> pads were <b>tested.</b> The second test series were conducted at three low brake cylinder pressure levels (0. 1, 0. 5 and 1 bar) with NAO and low metallic type brake pads, without any oxide layer. Promising results from the first test series indicate that this <b>test</b> <b>stand</b> can be used to study oxide layer removal from the rotor. The results are also promising for the ability to rank the number and size distribution from different pad rotor material combinations. The second test series shows that even at low pressures measurable levels of airborne particles are generated. QC 2011080...|$|R
50|$|A <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> is a {{term used}} in motorsport.

40|$|At present time, the <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> bench conducts the <b>braking</b> and {{suspension}} <b>tests</b> of {{front or}} rear axles {{and the test}} results are evaluated through one axle. The purpose of the <b>brake</b> <b>testing</b> system is to determine braking force and damping coefficient dissymmetry of one axle. Thus, this test system evaluates the performance of service brake, hand brake and suspension systems by considering separately front and rear axle dissymmetry. For this reason, the effects of different braking and damping forces applied by right and left wheels of both axles on braking performance of all vehicle are not determined due to available algorithm of the test bench. Also, the other brake failures are not occurred due to the algorithm of <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> system. In this study, the interface has been developed to determine the other effects of dissymmetry and the other brake failures by using the one axle results of <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> bench. The interface has algorithm computing the parameters according to the interaction between front and rear axles by only using measured test results. Also, it gives the warnings by comparing changes in the parameters with braking performance rules. <b>Braking</b> and suspension <b>tests</b> of three different vehicles have been conducted by using <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> bench to determine {{the performance of the}} algorithm. Parameters based on the axle interaction have been calculated by transferring <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> results to the interface and the test results have been evaluated. As a result, the effects of brake and suspension failures on braking performance of both axle and vehicle have been determined thanks to the developed interface. </span...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This paper aims at {{identifying}} {{the most significant}} measures in two perception—response (PR) tests performed at a driving simulator: a <b>braking</b> <b>test</b> and a lateral skid test, which was developed in this work. Methods: 48 subjects (26 females and 22 males) {{with a mean age}} of 24. 9 ± 3. 0 years were enrolled for this study. They were asked to perform a drive on the driving simulator at the University of Pisa (Italy) following a specific test protocol, including 8 – 10 <b>braking</b> <b>tests</b> and 8 – 10 lateral skid tests. Driver input signals and vehicle model signals were recorded during the drives and analysed to extract some measures, such as the reaction time, the first response time, etc. Following a statistical procedure (based on ANOVA and post-hoc tests), all test measures (3 for the <b>braking</b> <b>test</b> and 8 for the lateral skid test) were analysed in terms of statistically significant differences among different drivers.

40|$|In the past, <b>brake</b> <b>testing</b> of rubber-tyred {{vehicles}} {{operating in}} quarries, opencast coal sites, mines and similar environments, comprised ‘simple’ stopping distance tests, typically {{carried out at}} daily or weekly intervals. More recently, many operators of such plant have progressed to using a <b>brake</b> <b>testing</b> method that employs electronic instrumentation, {{as a means of}} determining the ‘brake ratio’ of a vehicle. This is because instrumented testing gives more accurate results. Accordingly, the time between performing these instrumented tests has increased to monthly, or even 3 -monthly, intervals. For both simple and instrumented test methods, international standard ISO 3450 is often (wrongly) used as the guide to acceptable <b>brake</b> performance <b>testing</b> regimes. The ISO standard contains formulae that enable either a stopping distance or a brake ratio to be calculated (depending on which test method is used). However, these calculated values are minimum levels of braking ability necessary for a vehicle to be placed on the market. That is, the ISO standard is a minimum standard for manufacture, not a maintenance standard. To put this into context, it is likely that any ‘modern’ vehicle will have levels of braking performance approaching twice these minimum ISO values. In using these ISO values as routine test pass or fail criteria, organisations may be indirectly accepting that brakes on modern vehicles can deteriorate by up to 50 per cent before their operators become concerned with braking ability. In addition, test conditions on site (particularly speed and gradient) may be much less onerous than those used in ISO 3450, which produces low test results. The overall outcome of this may be a ‘poor’ <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> result, but one that exceeds a low level pass criterion and is not, therefore, seen as a test failure. Another common problem with some <b>brake</b> <b>testing</b> regimes is that they do not readily correlate to site operating conditions; in particular to gradients, but also to vehicle speed and load. The law requires organisations to ‘ensure’ that work equipment is suitable (safe) for the conditions of use it will encounter. This means being able to demonstrate that vehicle braking capabilities are adequate for actual site operating gradients, speeds and loads. Naturally therefore, any testing regime should accurately take account of the site conditions which the vehicle will be exposed to. In order to address these shortcomings regarding <b>brake</b> <b>testing</b> of rubber-tyred vehicles, this guide explains the brake ratio method of <b>brake</b> <b>testing.</b> A step-by-step guide on how to correlate braking performance with actual site conditions and how to design and put in place a suitable <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> regime is preceded by several discussion chapters.
