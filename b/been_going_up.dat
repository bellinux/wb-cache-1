25|$|The {{layout of}} the {{intersection}} is very poor for trucks making this turn, and the congestion all these factors create has been forcing more drivers to resort to side streets, the village believes, since traffic counts have <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> on 52 and 208 but down on the concurrency.

6000|$|... "(Nitrates, it need {{hardly be}} said, {{had all this}} time <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> by leaps and bounds.

Chateaux have <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> in smoke during the last fortnight. The peasants took their cue from the Parisians, and treated every castle as a Bastille. Order is being restored, there as here, and they are quieter now." ...|$|E
60|$|Another time, Cornelia, {{when she}} came, found Charmian {{lighting}} {{one of the}} cigars kept for show on her mantel. She laughed wildly at Cornelia's dismay, and the smoke, which had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> her nose, went down her throat in a volume, and Cornelia had to run and catch her; she was reaching out in every direction for help.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is absurd!" [...] Laverick exclaimed protestingly. [...] "I {{have been}} feeling worried myself, but there's nothing so terrifying in losing one's money, after all. As {{a matter of}} fact, things are {{altogether}} better in the city to-day. You {{made a big mistake}} in taking us out of our depth, {{but we are going to}} pull through, after all.

The German said to her: ‘This is all over, mein Taubchen. I am going home now to get married to the girl I got engaged to before coming out here.’ And Anne said: ‘All right, I’m ready to go. We part friends, don’t we?’ ...|$|E

He's not {{put them on}} since Moriarty bate him in the middles, so he {{may be out of}} practice. But even then he'd be a bad man to tackle. He's big an' he's strong, an' if he'd only had the heart in him he'd have <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to Aldershot instead of Moriarty. That's what he'd be doing. An' you can't box at all. Never even had the gloves on." ...|$|E
60|$|Nearing Sherton-Abbas, the {{previous}} information {{was confirmed by}} other strollers, though the gentleman's supporting arm had disappeared from these later accounts. At last they were so near Sherton that Melbury informed his faithful followers {{that he did not}} wish to drag them farther at so late an hour, since he could go on alone and inquire if the woman who had been seen were really Grace. But they would not leave him alone in his anxiety, and trudged onward till the lamplight from the town began to illuminate their fronts. At the entrance to the High Street they got fresh scent of the pursued, but coupled with the new condition that the lady in the costume described had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> the street alone.|$|E
2500|$|Now as Jesus <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to Jerusalem, he {{took the}} twelve disciples aside and said to them, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the {{teachers}} of the law. They will condemn him to death and will turn {{him over to the}} Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. On the third day he will be raised to life!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Shelton had {{expected}} a more lofty reason; he applied {{himself to the}} Madeira in his glass. That, had been [...] "collected" [...] by his host, and its price <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up!</b> You couldn't get it every day; worth two guineas a bottle! How precious the idea that other people couldn't get it, made it seem! Liquid delight; the price <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up!</b> Soon there would be none left; immense! Absolutely no one, then, could drink it! ...|$|R

60|$|GEOFFREY I know; I know. I've <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> {{and down}} the country, excusing even your excesses {{on the ground that}} no {{movement}} can force its way to the front without treading on innumerable toes. For me, now, to cry halt merely because it happens to be my own toes that are in the way would be--ridiculous--absurd--would be monstrous. [Nobody contradicts him.] You are perfectly justified- -if this case means what you say it does--in putting up a candidate against me for East Poplar. Only, naturally, it cannot be Annys. [He reaches out his hand to where ANNYS stands a little behind him, takes her hand.] Annys and I have fought more than one election. It has been side by side.|$|E
60|$|One other point, before I conclude, {{about this}} matter. These reefs, {{as you have}} just perceived, are in a most {{singular}} and unexpected manner indications of physical changes of elevations and depressions going on upon {{the surface of the}} globe. I dare say it may have surprised you to hear me talk in this familiar sort of way of land going up and down; but {{it is one of the}} universal lessons of geology that the land is going down and going up, and has <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> and down, in all sorts of places and to all sorts of distances, through all recorded time. Geologists would be quite right in maintaining the seeming paradox that the stable thing in the world is the fluid sea and the shifting thing is the solid land. That may sound a very hard saying at first, but the more you look into geology, the more you will see ground for believing that it is not a mere paradox.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{information}} is varied and peculiar," [...] he said, [...] "and {{not of the}} sort that generally appeals to Her Majesty's examiners. Still, I see that you have intelligence and, of course, the French is an asset; also the literature to some extent, and the Latin, though these would have counted more had you <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> for the Indian Civil. I think we can get you through in three months if you will work; it all depends on that. You will find a lot of young men here of whom quite seventy per cent. do nothing, except see life. Very nice fellows in their way, {{but if you want to}} get into Sandhurst, keep clear of them. Now, my term opens next Monday. I will write to General Cubitte and tell him what I think of you, also that the fees are payable in advance. Good-bye, glad you happened to catch me, which you would not have done half an hour later, as I am going out of town. At ten o'clock next Monday, please." ...|$|E

60|$|Yet the shipping-clerk evinced {{a strong}} desire to talk to Richard privately, and finally accosted him just as he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> the stairs.|$|R
60|$|At noon he {{returned}} to the Percy Standard, very tired, there to await the coming of Mr. Griffenbottom. Mr. Griffenbottom didn't come till three, and then bustled up into the sitting-room, which Sir Thomas had thought was his own, as though all Percycross belonged to him. During the last three hours supporters had been in and out continually, and Mr. Pabsby had made an ineffectual attempt or two to catch Sir Thomas alone. Trigger had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> and down between the Standard and the station. Various men, friends and supporters of Griffenbottom and Underwood, had been brought to him. Who were paid agents, who were wealthy townsmen, who were canvassers and messengers, he did not know. There were bottles on the sideboard the whole time. Sir Thomas, in a speculative manner, endeavouring to realise to himself the individuality of this and that stranger, could only conceive that they who helped themselves were wealthy townsmen, and that they who waited till they were asked by others were paid canvassers and agents. But he knew nothing, and could only wish himself back in Southampton Buildings.|$|E

50|$|In June 2005, the Consulate General {{introduced}} an online appointment service for all categories of visa applications. The Consulate General processes visa applications {{from the states}} of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. In 2006, the Consulate opened new visa application centres at Chennai, Hyderabad and Kochi. In 2008, the Consulate General of Germany, Bangalore started handling applications from residents in Karnataka and Kerala.

50|$|VPT is {{interpreted}} in similar ways to OBV. Generally, {{the idea is}} that volume is higher on days with a price move in the dominant direction, for example in a strong uptrend more volume on up days than down days. So, when prices <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>up,</b> VPT should <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> too, and when prices make a new rally high, VPT should too. If VPT fails to go past its previous rally high then this is a negative divergence, suggesting a weak move.|$|R
5000|$|The third {{prediction}} in the [...] specifically mentions crucifixion: Now as Jesus <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to Jerusalem, he {{took the}} twelve disciples aside and said to them, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the law.

It is exactly one year till the Sochi Olympic Games, and I would like to skate my best there. I would like to bring this confidence into my free skating tomorrow", Asada said.|$|E
5000|$|... "''''Hurting''''" [...] {{is a song}} {{written and}} {{performed}} by Canadian singer Karl Wolf from his third studio album, Nightlife. A remix version of the song that features Sway, was released as the official single.

5000|$|B {{rooms are}} {{where the best}} aspects of both A rooms and C rooms meet. Young comics need B rooms as a {{stepping}} stone. These are rooms where someone doing a 10- to 15-minute set (hosting/MCing) can be asked, after they've <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> long enough, to do a 20-minute set (featuring) and so on. These clubs also typically allow dirtier material, since they can become established names for [...] "dirty" [...] comedy or shows that usually cover adult themes.|$|E
