40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Grass seed {{producers}} in Oregon's Willamette Valley have employed the cultural practice of post-harvest open field burning since the mid- 1940 's {{for purposes of}} field sanitation and crop residue disposal This practice creates environmental quality problems of air pollution during the late summer Recent public concern over the valley's environmental quality has focused attention on the grass seed industry, resulting in measures passed by the 1971 state legislature to ban open field burning in Oregon by January 1, 1975. Several economic issues are raised {{by the prospect of}} field burning curtailment. These include identification of: (1) alternatives to open burning, and their associated costs; (2) income effects resulting from possible increases in production costs, reduction in seed yields and changes in seed quality; (3) possible loss of comparative advantage now enjoyed by Willamette Valley farmers; and, (4) possible organizational adjustments by farm operators including prospects for increased farm size and reduced farm numbers. This thesis is designed as a base study to provide descriptive information and an economic rationale as necessary precursors for evaluating possible and probable' economic consequences of a <b>burning</b> <b>ban</b> to the grass seed industry. The Willamette Valley was separated into five seed-production regions, based on soil characteristics and urban. influences. A ten percent random sample was drawn from the population of farm operators raising grass seed. Major grass seed types studied include Highland bentgrass, Kentucky bluegrass, fine fescue, tall fescue, orchard grass, annual ryegrass, and perennial ryegrass. Descriptive data includes farm family characteristics, income sources, age, family labor, farm organization, and resource returns. Analysis of data identified wide variability in resource use. A significant component involved large differences in operating costs for machinery, labor, fertilizer, and chemicals within each seed type. This suggests internal adjustments in resource use efficiency and cost management are necessary for high-cost farms to survive in the short run {{regardless of whether or not}} a <b>burning</b> <b>ban</b> threat exists. Some farms are successfully competing now and will continue to do so with limited operating resource adjustments. Orchardgrass and Kentucky bluegrass generally provided highest net returns, while ryegrasses earned lowest returns of the seven seed types, suggesting some adjustment opportunities for substitution between seed types. Inter-enterprise adjustments will be determined by the number of grass seed crops, other non-grass crops, and livestock choices available. Cost advantages of complementary enterprises were evident, with adjustments in this direction determined by market accessibility, soil limitations, and managerial constraints. These limitations suggest limited adjustment, in general, toward non-grass and livestock enterprise choices. Pronounced cost advantages occurred to farms over 300 acres in size, suggesting that long run adjustments will likely include farm enlargement and reduction of farm numbers. Farm location, topography,-, and proximity to urban areas are also expected to affect direction and magnitude of adjustments. Farms in Region 1, Clackamas and Multnomah counties, faced with topography limitations and urban pressures, will likely shift resources to more intensive. farm and non-farm uses. Linn, Benton, and Lane county grass seed producers are expected to intensify specialization in grass seed production with an increase in average farm size. In Washington and Yamhill counties where grass seed production serves primarily as complementary and/or supplementary enterprises, the trend toward production of proprietary grass seed varieties is expected. In Polk and Marion counties where soil and topographical characteristics dominate resource use and enterprise choices, probable adjustment impacts are less obvious and are expected to vary widely from farm to farm. Imposition of a <b>burning</b> <b>ban,</b> felt primarily in the form of increased production costs, will undoubtedly hasten the farm organizational adjustments specified above...|$|E
30|$|Such herding {{practices}} of migrating herds to higher and lower elevations {{and including the}} maintenance of pastureland {{is very similar to}} that of some groups of herders in Qilianshan of Gansu Province  in China (Alexander et al. 2015). While herding livestock, the depredation of livestock by wildlife species, shortage of pasture land and animal diseases are some of the problems faced by the herders in our study area. The grazing problem rose after the establishment of WCNP in 2008 owing to a complete ban on burning of pasturelands. The park officials patrol the area occasionally to supervise the pastureland and other wrong-doings in the park. The <b>burning</b> <b>ban</b> in the grazing area in Qilianshan in China has also led to problems (Alexander et al. 2015). The correlation between incidences of animal diseases and herding practices warrants a further study. However, by looking at the number of cases mentioned in our case study, the problem of animal disease is not as severe as that in the Sanjiangyuan region of the Tibetan plateau, where disease caused about four times the number of the alleged livestock losses as compared to depredation by SLs (Li et al. 2013). Even in Qilianshan in China, natural disasters and diseases were responsible for 65 % and 63 % of livestock loss respectively (Alexander et al. 2015). The fewer number of disease cases could be due to continuous effort and supervision from the district veterinary office in our case study area. The depredation by wildlife is treated as the most severe problem, which has led to a decline in herders and livestock population in the study area.The herders in the study area have several sources of income, mainly dependent on livestock husbandry and cordyceps collection and sale. They consider livestock herding as the prime source of income besides the fact that cordyceps collection and sale contributes more to their annual income, because they found cordyceps collection and sale production and price not reliable. Moreover, cordyceps are considered as state resources and any eligible collectors can come and collect, which is why the numbers of collectors have increased drastically over the years.|$|E

40|$|Post- 2000 {{efforts to}} protect China’s {{grassland}} areas are distinct from earlier efforts in that funding for the most recent round of policies and programs is commensurate with the task. Among the most controversial of the current policies is the provision of an annual subsidy ranging from 2 yuan to 20 yuan/mu (1 / 15 hectare) to herders to not graze livestock contracted by their families for periods from 3 - 10 years. Many other recent policies, such as fencing programs and hunting and <b>burning</b> <b>bans</b> to protect keystone species are also controversial. Ideally, the policies are intended to protect grassland ecological systems while assuring acceptable revenues to affected families and regions.

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{agricultural}} <b>burning</b> is <b>banned</b> in Russia, it {{is still}} a widespread practice. Accurately monitoring cropland burned area is an important task as these estimates are used in the calculation of cropland burning emissions, which are ultimately utilized in policy making decisions. In this paper we developed an independent estimate of cropland burning in Russia through assessing the capabilities of global burned area products (MCD 45 A 1; Roy et al., 2008 and MCD 64 A 1; Giglio et al., 2009) and our own custom Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based Cropland Regional Area Burned (CRAB) product. An archive of cropland field state samples was generated from very high resolution (< 5 m) imagery allowing us a unique perspective into the challenges of mapping cropland burned area through detailed analysis of the Russian agricultural practices. Our analysis showed all three burned area products were unable to map approximately 95 % of burn validation samples, demonstrating that the current coarse resolution (defined here as ≥ 500 m) satellite capabilities are not adequate for accurately mapping burned area associated with agricultural fires. The transient nature of cropland burns and the climatological conditions of the region require multiple subsequent daily overpasses; however, the small spatial scale of the burns requires moderate (defined here as 10 – 50 m) spatial resolutions. Future opportunities to accurately map cropland burned area may arise with the Sentinel- 2 and Landsat constellation missions...|$|R

50|$|Advancements in {{fertilizers}} and natural pesticides {{have all but}} eliminated the need to burn fields. Sugarcane fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash. There has been less burning due to pressure from the public and health authorities, {{and as a result}} of the recent development of effective harvesting machines. In the mid 90s, it was very common to experience quite dense ash rains in cities within the sugarcane's fields during harvest seasons.A 2001 state law <b>banned</b> <b>burning</b> in sugarcane fields in São Paulo state by 2021, and machines will gradually replace human labor as the means of harvesting cane, except where the abrupt terrain does not allow for mechanical harvesting. However, 150 out of 170 of São Paulo's sugar cane processing plants signed in 2007 a voluntary agreement with the state government to comply by 2014. Independent growers signed in 2008 the voluntary agreement to comply, and the deadline was extended to 2017 for sugar cane fields located in more abrupt terrain. By the 2009/10 harvest season more than 50% of the cane was collected in São Paulo with harvesting machines. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, but also will create unemployment for these seasonal workers, many of them coming from the poorest regions of Brazil. Due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined as each harvester machine replaces about 100 cane cutters a day and creates 30 jobs including operators and maintenance teams.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn spring 2006, the European Arctic was {{abnormally}} warm, setting new historical temperature records. During this warm period, {{smoke from}} agricultural fires in Eastern Europe intruded into the European Arctic and caused {{the most severe}} air pollution episodes ever recorded there. This paper confirms that biomass burning (BB) was indeed {{the source of the}} observed air pollution, studies the transport of the smoke into the Arctic, and presents an overview of the observations taken during the episode. Fire detections from the MODIS instruments aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites were used to estimate the BB emissions. The FLEXPART particle dispersion model was used to show that the smoke was transported to Spitsbergen and Iceland, which was confirmed by MODIS retrievals of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and AIRS retrievals of carbon monoxide (CO) total columns. Concentrations of halocarbons, carbon dioxide and CO, as well as levoglucosan and potassium, measured at Zeppelin mountain near Ny Ålesund, were used to further corroborate the BB source of the smoke at Spitsbergen. The ozone (O 3) and CO concentrations were the highest ever observed at the Zeppelin station, and gaseous elemental mercury was also elevated. A new O 3 record was also set at a station on Iceland. The smoke was strongly absorbing ? black carbon concentrations were the highest ever recorded at Zeppelin ? and strongly perturbed the radiation transmission in the atmosphere: aerosol optical depths were the highest ever measured at Ny Ålesund. We furthermore discuss the aerosol chemical composition, obtained from filter samples, as well as the aerosol size distribution during the smoke event. Photographs show that the snow at a glacier on Spitsbergen became discolored during the episode and, thus, the snow albedo was reduced. Samples of this polluted snow contained strongly elevated levels of potassium, sulphate, nitrate and ammonium ions, thus relating the discoloration to the deposition of the smoke aerosols. This paper shows that, to date, BB has been underestimated as a source of aerosol and air pollution for the Arctic, relative to emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Given its significant impact on air quality over large spatial scales and on radiative processes, the practice of agricultural waste <b>burning</b> should be <b>banned</b> in the future...|$|R
40|$|The spotted stalk borer, Chilo sacchariphagus Bojer, {{is a major}} pest of {{sugarcane}} {{in southern}} Asia and on islands in the southwest of the Indian Ocean. In Reunion, Mauritius and Madagascar, the borer has been a serious pest since it was introduced with sugarcane during the 19 th century. The Entomology Laboratory of CIRAD, which has been working for nearly 30 years on insect pests, including stem borers, has focused its research programme on {{the control of the}} spotted stalk borer since 1994. About 17 species of natural enemies of C. sacchariphagus were introduced into Reunion from various countries in the 1970 s, but only one third of them established themselves and none have successfully controlled populations of the borer. Therefore, the bio-ecology of the borer is being re-examined, from population dynamics in the field to laboratory studies, with biological control of the borer as the main goal. Life tables studies indicate that the borer is more likely to develop large populations in the lowlands of the island, where the temperature exceeds 20 °C nearly all year round (optimum temperature for development of C. sacchariphagus is 26 °C). The population dynamics of the borer were precisely determined, on the two main varieties of sugarcane (R 570 and R 579) grown in Reunion, at two sites on the island representing distinct climatic zones. On a regional scale, the population dynamics of C. sacchariphagus have been studied in relation to damage caused to sugarcane. Such damage is expressed as the number of infested sugarcane internodes in sampled stalks. These factors have been examined in relation to variety, cultural, practices, and climate for four consecutive years at 50 sites distributed over the island. Similarities in infestation level observed between neighbouring sites were frequent, and revealed a regional pattern, probably related to the local climate. Crop loss studies showed that only R 579 was affected in terms of cane yield, expressing a reduction in growth rate, height and diameter of the stalks at harvest. In heavy infestations, yield loss can reach 30 % of the mass of commercial cane, compared with losses in resistant variety R 570. Repeated studies over several crop cycles and field trials also confirmed that the variety R 579 was more susceptible to C. sacchariphagus than the more common variety R 570. The latter is resistant to the borer and various aspects of this resistance (antibiosis, antixenosis, and penetrometry of stalks) have been investigated. Resistance appears to be due, at least in part, to the mechanical characteristics of cane stalks arising from the structure of plant tissues and components of cell walls (tannin, lignin or silicate). This is being studied using artificial diets with sugarcane powder to rear C. sacchariphagus larvae. The impact of predators, predominantly ants of the genus Pheidole, on borer egg masses was quantified: 80 - 90 % of the eggs are eaten by predators. It is believed that the practice of burning the crop, before or after harvesting, has negative effects on natural enemies; moreover borer larvae and pupae, living inside the stalks, are less affected by the burning practice. Observations have shown that when <b>burning</b> was <b>banned,</b> natural enemy populations increased and damage due to borers was reduced. C. sacchariphagus and Galleria mellonella eggs are used to trap egg-parasitoids in the field in order to identify parasitoids and to examine their population dynamics. Natural parasitism of borer eggs is about 30 - 40 %, with maximum parasitism observed from November to February. To date, a single species, Trichogramma chilonis Ishii, has been recovered in sugarcane fields in Reunion. Bionomics of the species and/or strains of Trichogramma collected in the fields are being examined in the laboratory to select appropriate strains for mass production and augmentative release programmes. Field experiments with inundative releases of Trichogramma are planned to test for their efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Pastoralists {{frequently}} {{depend on}} fire to produce forage for their livestock, but traditional <b>burning</b> is often <b>banned,</b> despite being essential for livelihoods and ecosystem maintenance. In the subalpine heathlands of Bale Mountains traditional fire management is still practiced. This offered {{a rare opportunity}} to analyze fire ecology and traditional fire knowledge in a fire-managed shrub system. My aim was to disentangle the interactions between livestock, fuels and vegetation in the heathlands and the forests below, through a combination of experimental and observational studies. My results show that the subalpine forests had a low fire potential due to lack of good surface fuels. In contrast, the Erica-dominated heathlands produced highly flammable fuel complexes. Here anthropogenic burning resulted in a regime of high-intensity fires with an average fire return interval of 10 years. However, the grazed heathlands were non-flammable the first 4 years post fire, due to lack of fine dead fuels and a discontinuous fuel bed. This helps create a patchy landscape in which young vegetation patches act as fire breaks, limiting the extent of subsequent fires. Interviews with pastoralists revealed three objectives for burning: to improve pasture, to remove an insect pest and to reduce livestock loss to predators. The informants were well aware of the critical relations between fuel structure, weather and fire behaviour, showing intimate knowledge of fire as a management tool. Cattle exclusion had relatively little impact on the vegetation and fuel development in both heathland and forest. Cattle browsing, however, dramatically altered the competitive balance between the two co-dominant shrubs E. arborea and E. trimera, favouring E. arborea. In the heathland the return to a flammable state was somewhat faster when cattle were excluded, but in the forest a denser field layer developed which did not increase flammability. Vegetative regeneration dominated after both fire and mechanical disturbance, despite a large seed bank in the top 10 cm of soil in both heathland and forest sites. In heathland sown Hagenia tree seedlings grew extremely poorly, probably due to unsuitable soil conditions. Neither did Hagenia seedlings survive in the forest zone, except in exclosures in large canopy gaps, showing that cattle exclusion alone is not sufficient for tree regeneration. Thus, the present division between heathland and forest is stabilized by the lack of fire potential in the forest and lack of potential for tree expansion into heathland. My results suggest that fire exclusion is not a viable option for the heathlands. It would destroy the pasture quality and is also unlikely to succeed, since huge tracts of highly flammable vegetation would soon develop. To successfully protect these ecosystems and pastoralist livelihoods, I recommend that a joint management plan is created that allows burning, but with defined prescriptions with regard to both fire intervals and fire weather...|$|R
