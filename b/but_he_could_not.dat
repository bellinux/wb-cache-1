5|$|Erik Palladino as Keith Griffin, {{a gay man}} {{dying of}} AIDS, {{drowning}} in his own bitterness and despair until befriended by Christian. Cox said that Palladino's performance was not how he originally envisioned it, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> now imagine a different person playing Keith.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels, however, wanted more, {{and he saw}} in Wessel's {{shooting}} {{the possibility of a}} propaganda bonanza. The beginning of his plan was to turn Wessel's funeral into a mass demonstration full of speeches and processions of SA men in uniform, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get the necessary police permits to do so, even after Wessel's sister requested Hindenburg to relent.|$|E
5|$|News of {{the film}} first emerged under the working title of Local Hero in January 2013. Jean-Claude Van Damme was rumored to be co-starring {{alongside}} Jaa, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> commit due to scheduling issues; he was filming Swelter at the time. Dolph Lundgren was cast as an alternative.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy drank, gasped, {{and tried}} to get up, <b>but</b> found <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> move.|$|R
6000|$|... "T-t-t-t-ta-ta-tay-tay-tay-tay----" [...] began Mohler, {{in great}} excitement, <b>but</b> as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> finish what <b>he</b> {{wanted to say}} no one caught his meaning.|$|R

5|$|At Star Treks creation, Norway Productions, Roddenberry's {{production}} company, {{shared ownership}} with Desilu Productions and, after Gulf+Western acquired Desilu in 1967, with Paramount Pictures, the conglomerate's film studio. Paramount {{did not want}} to own the unsuccessful show; net profit was to be shared between Norway, Desilu/Paramount, Shatner, and NBC but Star Trek lost money, and the studio did not expect to syndicate it. In 1970 Paramount offered to sell all rights to Star Trek to Roddenberry, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford the $150,000 ($ in 2007) price.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fights}} for the ramparts of Wola, only {{artillery}} {{of the second}} line gave limited support to the outnumbered Polish troops. Krukowiecki claimed after the war that he ordered Dembiński, Bem and General Franciszek Młokosiewicz to support the first line, but apparently none of them received the order. General Ludwik Bogusławski, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division manning the second line, could have supported the forts of the first line, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{see what was happening}} in Fort 56 due to dense smoke and the trees of Brühl's Garden.|$|E
5|$|György Borbély, Ban of Karánsebes, {{captured}} Lippa (now Lipova in Romania) {{and other}} Ottoman fortresses along the Maros River {{before the end}} of August. Koca Sinan Pasha broke into Wallachia, forcing Michael the Brave to retreat towards Transylvania. Michael routed the invaders in the Battle of Călugăreni, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> prevent them from seizing Târgoviște and Bucharest. He withdrew to Stoenești to await the arrival of the Transylvanian and Moldavian troops.|$|E
60|$|He {{knew that}} she was a Harpy. He knew that her soft words would only bring him to new grief. <b>But</b> yet <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> help himself. Strong, in so much else, he was utterly weak in her hands. She was a Harpy who would claw out his heart and feed upon it, without one tender feeling of her own. He had learned to read her character, and to know her for what she was. <b>But</b> yet <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> help himself.|$|R
60|$|Fred moved pettishly, <b>but</b> as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> refuse, <b>he</b> only told Henrietta that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> bear any one {{to look at}} {{him while}} his pulse was felt.|$|R
50|$|He {{was further}} {{chosen for the}} famous Original All Blacks tour, <b>but</b> again, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> obtain work leave and {{had to stay in}} the country.|$|R
5|$|In 1964, Altgens testified for the Warren Commission and {{was asked}} about the gunfire and whether he knew its source. He said he had not been keeping track of the number of gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza because he {{believed}} them to be fireworks, but he was certain of at least two. Altgens believed Kennedy's wounds suggested a final shot that came from the vicinity of the book depository building, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> say with any certainty.|$|E
5|$|Michael the Brave, Voivode of Wallachia, and Ștefan Răzvan, Voivode of Moldavia, {{acknowledged}} his suzerainty. Their united forces defeated an Ottoman {{army in the}} Battle of Giurgiu. The triumph {{was followed}} by a series of Ottoman victories, and Sigismund abdicated in favor of Rudolph II in early 1598, receiving the duchies of Racibórz and Opole as a compensation. His maternal uncle, Stephen Bocskai, persuaded him to return in late summer, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> make peace with the Ottoman Empire. He renounced Transylvania in favor of Andrew Báthory and settled in Poland in 1599. During the following years, Transylvania was regularly pillaged by unpaid mercenaries and Ottoman marauders. Sigismund returned {{at the head of a}} Polish army in 1601, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> strengthen his position. He again abdicated in favor of Rudolph and settled in Bohemia in July 1602. After he was accused of a conspiracy against the emperor, he spent fourteen months in jail in Prague in 1610 and 1611. He died at his Bohemian estate.|$|E
5|$|Zersenay took {{third place}} at the 2009 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in a closely contested race, {{finishing}} just behind a resurgent Gebregziabher Gebremariam and Ugandan runner Moses Kipsiro. He competed in his first ever full-length marathon in April, signing up for the London Marathon. His first appearance over the distance was much anticipated following his cross country and track success, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> finish the race, pulling out around the 35km mark.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> even <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{conceal the}} torments of {{unsuccessful}} love. He stirred his tea moodily, and his usual appetite for plum-cake had quite deserted him.|$|R
60|$|Tom {{had picked}} up the {{electric}} pocket light, <b>but</b> found <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> make it work. Again they were in darkness until another match was lit.|$|R
60|$|He did try, poor wretch, <b>but,</b> obviously, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> There was no doubt, however, that he {{knew what}} to expect from the stern man before him.|$|R
5|$|After graduation, Barkley went to Emory College (now part of Emory University) in Oxford, Georgia, the {{alma mater}} of several administrators {{and faculty members}} at Marvin. During the 1897–1898 {{academic}} year, he {{was active in the}} debating society and the Delta Tau Delta fraternity, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford to continue his education and returned to Clinton after the spring semester. He took a job teaching at Marvin College but did not make enough money to meet his basic living expenses. He resigned in December 1898 to move with his parents to Paducah, Kentucky, the county seat of McCracken County, where his father found employment at a cordage mill.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond made an {{alliance}} with Az-Zahir Ghazi, the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo, and Kaykaus I, the Seljuq sultan of Rum, who often invaded Cilicia during the following years, to prevent Leo I from attacking Antioch. Conflicts between Bohemond and the Latin Patriarchs of Antioch enabled Raymond-Roupen to seize Antioch in 1216, but Bohemond regained the principality in 1219. After Leo I's death, Bohemond tried to secure Cilicia to his younger son, Philip, but Constantine of Baberon, who had administered Cilicia during the previous years, imprisoned Philip in 1224. Bohemond allied with Kayqubad I, sultan of Rum, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> prevent Philip's murder in 1225.|$|E
5|$|Even Larsson's {{good friend}} and biographist Georg Nordensvan joined the critics, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> sway Larsson's {{determination}} either, although Larsson probably took his criticism hardest. The archaeologist Bror Schnittger, who was probably identical to the anonymous writer who had initiated the criticism, launched additional criticism in Svenska Dagbladet against the lack of historical authenticity in the painting. The distance in dating between the objects in the painting were given as at least 2000 years and Schnittger thought that the painting was unacceptable in the museum building. Larsson stated that he intentionally included objects that would be from the distant past {{in relation to the}} setting of the painting, and that he did not see these as anachronisms, because he imagined the subjects would be antiquarians who kept ancient items as ritual objects.|$|E
6000|$|Bernard {{said nothing}} for a moment, and Gordon {{presently}} glanced at his face to see why he was silent. Bernard, looking askance, met his companion's eyes, and then, resting his own upon them, he stopped short. His heart was beating; {{it was a question}} of saying to Gordon outright, [...] "I have been occupied in becoming engaged to Angela Vivian." [...] <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> say it, and yet he must say something. He tried to invent something; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> think of nothing, and still Gordon was looking at him.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Gashleigh {{has never}} liked {{him since he}} left off calling her mamma, and kissing her. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> stand it any longer--he was hanged if he would. So he went away to chambers, leaving the field clear to Rosa, mamma, and the two dear girls.|$|R
50|$|Matt Gresham had {{originally}} been put through to Home Visits in the Over 24s category <b>but</b> decided <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> commit to the competition {{and was replaced by}} Dami Im.|$|R
5|$|In 1953, Julian founded his own {{research}} firm, Julian Laboratories, Inc. He brought {{many of his}} best chemists, including African-Americans and women, from Glidden to his own company. Julian won a contract to provide Upjohn with $2 million worth of progesterone (equivalent to $ million today). To compete against Syntex, {{he would have to}} use the same Mexican yam Mexican barbasco trade as his starting material. Julian used his own money and borrowed from friends to build a processing plant in Mexico, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get a permit from the government to harvest the yams. Abraham Zlotnik, a former Jewish University of Vienna classmate whom Julian had helped escape from the Holocaust, led a search to find a new source of the yam in Guatemala for the company.|$|E
5|$|On 12 July 1936, in Madrid, {{a member}} of the Falange named Jorge Bardina murdered Lieutenant José Castillo of the Assault Guards police force. Castillo was {{a member of}} the Socialist party. The next day, members of the Assault Guards arrested José Calvo Sotelo, a leading Spanish monarchist and a {{prominent}} parliamentary conservative; the original target was Gil Robles <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be found. Calvo Sotelo had protested against agricultural reforms, expropriations, and restrictions on the authority of the Catholic Church, which he considered Bolshevist and anarchist. He instead advocated the creation of a corporative state. Calvo Sotelo was shot by the Guards without trial.|$|E
5|$|P. S. Raman, {{who went}} to Chennai in 1963 to join a medical college, was asked to see Sridhar, who was auditioning {{newcomers}} for the film. Raman was renamed Ravichandran and introduced in this film, as the character Ashok. Sivakumar had auditioned for the role before it went to Ravichandran. During a flight, Sridhar met an air-hostess named Vasundhara Devi and approached her to play one of the female leads. Because she shared her name with Vasundhara Devi, the mother of actress Vyjayanthimala, Sridhar renamed her Kanchana to avoid confusion. Telugu actor Krishna has stated that he was offered {{a role in the}} film by Sridhar, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> accept it due to his lack of knowledge in Tamil.|$|E
60|$|However, {{he would}} not {{positively}} promise to go. He said he should like to go very much, <b>but</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> decide the question until he should go home.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> now <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not,</b> in honour, use the Sword of Sharpness; so on he came, {{waving the}} rapier like a claymore, {{and made a}} slice at Prince Charles's head.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of May 30 an {{anonymous}} caller remonstrated Weyerhaeuser for not following instructions; Weyerhaeuser insisted that {{he had wanted to}} cooperate <b>but</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> find the last note.|$|R
5|$|Roupen III of Armenian Cilicia laid siege to Lampron, {{the seat}} of his rival, Hethum III of Lampron. Hethum sent envoys to Bohemond, seeking his assistance. Bohemond invited Roupen to a banquet to Antioch where he had Roupen {{captured}} and imprisoned in 1185. Bohemond invaded Cilicia, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> prevent Roupen's brother, Leo, from seizing Lampron. An Armenian nobleman, Pagouran of Barbaron, medieted a peace treaty. Roupen agreed to pay a ransom and to renounce Sarventikar, Tall Hamdun, Mamistra, and Adana. He also acknowledged Bohemond's suzerainty. After the ransom was paid in 1186, Bohemond released Roupen, who soon reconquered the fortresses and towns that he had ceded to Antioch.|$|E
5|$|The wealthiest landholders {{forced the}} lesser nobles {{to join their}} retinue, which {{increased}} their power. One of the barons, Joachim of the Gutkeled clan, even captured StephenV's heir, the infant Ladislaus, in 1272. StephenV died some months later, causing a new civil war between the Csák, Kőszegi, and other leading families who attempted to control the central government {{in the name of}} the young LadislausIV. He was declared to be of age in 1277 at an assembly of the spiritual and temporal lords and of the noblemen's and Cumans' representatives, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> strengthen royal authority. LadislausIV, whose mother, Elisabeth, was a Cuman chieftain's daughter, preferred his Cuman kin, which made him unpopular. He was even accused of initiating a second Mongol invasion in 1285, although the invaders were routed by the royal troops.|$|E
5|$|To get to Europe, Trotter {{posed as}} a seaman seeking work in New York, {{and got a}} job as a cook on the SS Yarmouth to gain passage to France. He arrived in Paris alone and with little more than his cook's clothing, only to find that the {{principal}} peace negotiations had already taken place. The powers did not include any statement of racial equality. Trotter attracted the French press in his accounts of racial mistreatment in the United States, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> gain access to any of the official delegations to the peace conference. He also missed Du Bois' Pan-African Congress, which was held in February 1919 while he was still seeking passage.|$|E
60|$|And {{then he went}} down, {{not because}} he thought of doing so, <b>but</b> because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> bear the weight. The stream closed over him and he went {{directly}} to the bottom.|$|R
