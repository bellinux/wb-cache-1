40|$|Rolling bearing noise {{has become}} an aspect of {{increasing}} importance {{for the performance of}} rotating machinery, like electric motors and gearboxes. Generally, two aspects are important with regard to bearing noise, i. e. the transmission characteristics and the vibration generation characteristics. A potential source of vibrations are for example manufacturing imperfections of the different bearing components. Damping of bearing vibrations is enhanced by the lubrication film between the rolling elements and the raceway of the bearing. Regarding vibrations of the total application, the reduction of vibration transmission can be increased by applying a constrained viscoelastic layer between the <b>bearing</b> and the <b>housings.</b> To design an effective damping layer a 3 D nonlinear time dependent computational model is developed to simulate the dynamic behaviour of a ball bearing application. The bearing model incorporates the stiffness and damping properties of the lubricant. Flexible components including the viscoelastic layer are modelled with FEM and reduced with a Component Mode Synthesis technique. Viscoelasticity is described both in the time and frequency domain by a generalized Maxwell model. The model is validated experimentally using constrained damping layer samples. Results are shown for a typical ball bearing application, showing that a proper design and material selection of the constrained layer is important for the reduction of the overall vibrations of the application...|$|R

A pillow block refers to any mounted bearing wherein the mounted shaft is in a parallel plane to the mounting surface, and perpendicular to the center line of the mounting holes, as contrasted with various types of flange blocks or flange units. A pillow block may contain a bearing with one of several types of rolling elements, including ball, cylindrical roller, spherical roller, tapered roller, or metallic or synthetic bushing.

Split type housings are usually two-piece housings where the cap and base may be detached, while others may be single-piece housings.

40|$|AbstractThe {{subject of}} {{investigations}} {{presented in this}} article is achieving the optimum attenuation of lateral vibration of rotors by means of two design variants of constraint elements: semiactive magnetorheological squeeze film dampers and actively controlled hydrodynamic bearings. The damping effect of magnetorheological dampers is controlled by the change of magnetic flux generated in electric coils and of the hydrodynamic bearings by the change of magnitude of the proportional gain of a feedback controller exciting movement of the <b>bearing</b> <b>housings.</b> In the developed mathematical models the rotor is considered as absolutely rigid and the controllable constraint elements are represented by force couplings. The rotor turns at constant angular speed, is loaded by its weight and in addition it is excited by a centrifugal force caused by the disc unbalance. In both design cases its lateral vibration is governed by a nonlinear equation of motion. The pressure distribution in the lubricating film in the magnetorheological squeeze film damper is described by a Reynolds equation modified for Bingham fluid whose yield shear stress depends on magnetic induction. The hydraulic forces acting in the hydrodynamic bearings are determined for the case of π-film cavitation and position of the <b>bearing</b> <b>housings</b> is adjusted by actuators activated by a proportional feedback controller. The aim of the analysis is to deal with approaches leading to minimizing amplitude of the rotor steady state vibration and magnitude of the force transmitted into the rotor casing and to compare efficiency of both design variants. The performed computer simulations show that the arrangement with the magnetorheological squeeze film damper gives better results in reducing magnitude of the transmitted force than those when the rotor is supported by hydrodynamic bearings with actively controlled position of the <b>bearing</b> <b>housings...</b>|$|E

The modification of this early 1950 's compressor involved elements of both practical and analytical design. The project included the design of new bearings and seals and the alteration of various support systems to permit operation with non-pressurized <b>bearing</b> <b>housings.</b> The project was undertaken as risk minimization, with all performance and reliability improvements being additional benefits.

The main objectives were to achieve reliable rotor dynamic characteristics and to maintain the integrity of the process labyrinth seals.

The investigation for root cause was conducted along two parallel paths: experimental and theoretical. On the experimental side a series of shop vibration tests and modal analysis was carried out at full operational speed and cold water (SG 1. 0). These tests included: pump as installed and two modifications of the <b>bearing</b> <b>housings.</b> With the theoretical approach several computer codes of hydraulic analysis were used for analytical diagnosis {{in order to identify}} the internal hydraulic phenomena inducing the vibrations. Unsteady hydraulic forces, very likely associated with impeller discharge recirculation, were eventually considered to produce the hydraulic excitation for high vibrations. The strategy for the ultimate solution was based on a new hydraulic design impeller with innovative geometry, i. e., two blade rows with five vanes at inlet and nine vanes at outlet.
