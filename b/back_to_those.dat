Full ODBC was later ported <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> platforms, and became a de facto standard considerably better known than CLI. The CLI remains similar to ODBC, and applications can be ported from one platform to the other with few changes.|$|E

That's why it was a bit tricky to get together in stages.|$|E
25|$|In the 13th lecture, Cyril of Jerusalem {{discusses}} the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are Original sin and Jesus’ sacrificing himself {{to save us}} from our sins. Also, the burial and Resurrection which occurred three days later proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the Father. Cyril was very adamant {{about the fact that}} Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only did he go willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes “who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten”. This line by Cyril shows his belief in the selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final act of Love. The lecture also gives a sort of insight to what Jesus may have been feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example, Cyril writes “I gave my <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who beat me and my cheeks to blows; and my face I did not shield from the shame of spitting”. This clearly reflects the teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheeks and not raising your hands against violence because violence just begets violence begets violence. The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the Bible; Cyril is not trying to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{messages}} sent by the player and the replies <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> messages {{have no effect on}} the game. The messages that the player sends are never explicitly revealed, though their contents can be inferred from replies received from other characters in the game. The player, therefore, is unable to send a [...] "wrong" [...] reply or message, and the game cannot be lost. The player does not have a choice in the direction that the story takes, though the game requires the player to correctly decipher what actions to take before the plot can advance. A single playthrough of the game takes around one hour.|$|E
500|$|For a decade, Johnson's {{constant}} {{work on the}} Dictionary disrupted his and Tetty's living conditions. He had {{to employ}} a number of assistants for the copying and mechanical work, which filled the house with incessant noise and clutter. He was always busy, and kept hundreds of books around. John Hawkins described the scene: [...] "The books he {{used for this purpose}} were what he had in his own collection, a copious but a miserably ragged one, and all such as he could borrow; which latter, if ever they came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> that lent them, were so defaced as to be scarce worth owning." [...] Johnson was also distracted by Tetty's poor health as she began to show signs of a terminal illness. To accommodate both his wife and his work, he moved to 17 Gough Square near his printer, William Strahan.|$|E

This situation gave additional <b>backing</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> Council members who were seeking independence without any ties to other countries. The prime concern at this point was <b>to</b> invite <b>back</b> <b>those</b> members who had left the Council.

500|$|Doom 3 {{received}} a favorable reception from critics, with the PC {{version of the}} game holding an 87 percent score and an 88 percent score at the review compilation sites Metacritic and GameRankings respectively.

IGN's Dan Adams noted that the game's presentation comprised a remarkably high proportion of the game, stating that [...] "without the atmosphere, Doom 3 is a plain shooter that hearkens <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> of the '90s." [...] In addition, several reviewers praised id Software for making the game still look surprisingly good even on lower graphics levels.|$|E

Mark's business partner, Nick, then arrives and acknowledges his wife's work back after firing him.
