40|$|AbstractResearch {{on channel}} <b>bed</b> <b>profiles</b> {{is one of}} the basic topics of river {{dynamics}} and fluvial process studies, since it was closely associated with the problems such as turbulent structure, flow resistance and sediment transportation in alluvial rivers. As a result of motion water flow interacting with sediment, channel <b>bed</b> <b>profiles</b> have irregular plane structures and self-similar microstructures, which were better analyzed by fractal method to reflect the intrinsic rough characteristics. In this study, several existing fractal dimension calculation methods were compared quantitatively, along with the discussion of their non-scale zones, correlation coefficients and computational accuracies. The following methods are included in this paper: Yard Stick Method, Box Counting Method, Variation Method, Structure Function Method, Root Mean Square Method and R/S Analysis Method.

40|$|From {{the past}} many {{numerical}} models which can predict coastal <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> updates have been developed. They are ranged from one dimensional shore line change model to three dimensional <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolution models. Three dimensional <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolution models include both cross shore (due to wave actions) and long shore (due to currents) sediment transports components and widely use to predict <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolutions from days to years. Two dimensional <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolution models include only cross shore (due to wave actions) sediment transport component and widely use to predict <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolution from hrs to days. One dimensional shoreline change models calculate <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolutions {{for months to}} years. All these models are capable of producing <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolutions well. However, to have detailed information on changing bed topography in short times, the effect of changing bed profiles to velocity fields and sediment concentrations in very short time periods can't be obtained using these models. Therefore, the present study aimed to develop a <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> updating model which can use to predict very short term <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolutions and to study {{the effect on the}} developed bed profiles on the velocity fields and sediment concentrations. For the developed model, as it is considering very short time <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolutions, only the cross shore sediment transport component was considered. Cross shore transport mainly governed by the wave actions specially wave breaking. The <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolutions due to wave breaking mainly occur due to the turbulences and complex fluid motions occurred during wave breaking. The turbulences make shear stress on the bottom which cause sediments to pick up and horizontal and obliquely descending eddies cause the picked up sediments to transport. Therefore, a model which can calculate the turbulences and eddy structures well was needed and LES was used for that purpose. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is a method for resolving the time dependent structure of high Reynolds number turbulent flows. LES is an important tool in wave breaking studies where flow mixing, sediment entrainment and sediment transport are all affected by the presence of coherent vortices and their interactions with boundaries and other flow structures. However, due to the simulation costs associated, the developed model can mainly be used for academic perspective where very small-scale <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> changes are analyzed (e. g., erosion around breakwater due to a sudden flow, profile change under each wave, profileevolutions under buried obstacle, flow fields around cobble mines etc.). An existing LES code (Wijayarathne, 2000; Suzuki et al., 2007) was improved further to model <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolution. The developed model consists of LES flow model, sediment pick up and advection model and a <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolution model. The velocity fields, bottom shear stresses and pressure fields are calculated from the LES flow model. Navier stocks equation modified by adding a sub grid scale model to calculate the small scale eddies is used in the LES flow model. The sediment pick up and advection module calculates the sediment pick up from the bottom using Nielsen's formula which is depend on the shields parameter. When the instantaneous shields parameter value is greater than the critical shear stress, pick up occurs. The instantaneous shields parameter is mainly depend on the bottom velocities. The picked up sediments are assumed to be transported with the flow fields. A flux approach was used to calculate the sediment transport. Sediments which achieved the settling velocity, settled to the bottom. The <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> evolution model uses the sediment continuity equation to calculate the profile update. The resultant of pick up and settled amounts caused for the <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> update. Settled sediment amount calculated considering the sediment concentrations in each cells which includes sheet flow and the settling velocity of the sediments. If the change in <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> is greater than 1 grid size, the corresponding grid is changed as a solid grid and if it is reduced more than one grid size, the corresponding grid is changed to water grid. The boundary conditions of the developed grids are changed accordingly. Mainly pressure and velocities are changed at the newly developed boundaries. The newly developed grids are updated to the domain and the next step's calculations are based on the new domain. The developed model was validated with the experimental results. Since several modifications were carried out in the existing flow module, the flow model also verified with the experimental results. Verification of the flow model was done with velocity fields and free surfaces. Particle image velocimetry was used to obtain velocity fields and wave gauge reading was used to obtain free surface distributions. With the results of free surfaces distributions, it was concluded that the numerical results are consistent with the experimental results. The non-linearity of the wave breaking region also well producedwith the model results. Results of velocity fields, both in magnitude and directions were consistent to each other. Small differences occurred due to random movements of seeded materials. The numerical model for the flow field after modifications was validated with the experimental results. The verified model was also used to simulate the flow around a stepped sea wall after wave overtopping. Several phases of a wave were considered. It was observed that the model is capable of simulating the overtopping well. The turbulence generated after wave overtopping caused high bottom shear stress and made some pick up and suspensions of sediments. Therefore, the change in <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> was observed after wave overtopping. Numerical results were compared with the experimental results for the generated bed profiles. It was observed that a considerable erosion occurs at the toe of the structure followed by a small deposition and erosion again afterwards in both experiment and numerical simulation. The <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> model results were validated with the profile evolution occurred due to wave overtopping from a stepped breakwater. The trend of profile evolutions were consistent in numerical and experimental results though numerical simulation results showed some overestimation. Some of the reasons for this discrepancy caused due to not considering the friction from the sediment clouds to the flow. This increases the velocities in the eroded cells and cause more erosion. Further, the large pressure gradient caused during wave overtopping also can cause for large erosion. Since the model can simulate the <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> change after the wave overtopping, model can be used to simulate erosion or depositions around breakwaters or some other structures during a storm surges or tsunamis where waves overtopped from the structure. The verified model was used to study the flow fields and sediment motions under different wave breaking conditions. Particularly, spilling and plunging breaking conditions. Plunging breaking where the turbulences occur mostly in the wave plume and spilling phenomena where the turbulences are concentrated on wave crest were well simulated from the model. Vertical sections of velocity fields of each wave breaking conditions were compared. It was observed that the plunging wave breaking has higher velocities as well as more turbulence than spilling breaking. Since the turbulences are concentrated on the wave plume, generation of bottom shear stresses is higher in plunging wave breaking condition...|$|E

A general analytical solution is obtained which expresses the <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> {{in terms of}} a modified longitudinal coordinate, accounting implicitly for channel convergence and adjacent shoals. For values of the relevant parameters typical of costal lagoons, inertia and friction effects as well as overtides are shown to provide minor corrections to the equilibrium <b>bed</b> <b>profile.</b> The overall shape of the profile is also shown to be slightly affected by the equilibrium condition used in its derivation, consisting in a requirement on either residual erosion/deposition fluxes or maximum velocity. In particular, the asymptotic form of the analytical solution is common to both the equilibrium requirements, thus suggesting the existence of general morphological relationships relating the depth at the channel mouth or, alternatively, the length of the channel to the tidal amplitude, to the degree of channel convergence, to the critical velocity for erosion/deposition and to the extent of intertidal storage areas. The profile shape is affected as well; for instance, nearly constant-depth channels tend to form when convergence is strong. The equilibrium configuration also implies that a power law relationship of the type proposed by O'Brien-Jarret-Marchi for tidal inlets, relating the channel cross section to the tidal prism, holds throughout the entire channel. Finally, the theoretical profile is shown to reasonably reproduce the bed configurations observed in a number of tidal channels surveyed within the Lagoon of Venice (Italy) ...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the morphodynamic equilibrium of tidally dominated alluvial estuaries, extending previous works concerning the purely tidal {{case and the}} combined tidal-fluvial case with a small tidal forcing. We relax the latter assumption and seek the equilibrium <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> of the estuary, for a given planform configuration with various degrees of funneling, solving numerically the 1 -D governing equation. The results show that with steady fluvial and tidal forcings, an equilibrium <b>bed</b> <b>profile</b> of estuaries exists. In the case of constant width estuaries, a concave down equilibrium profile develops {{through most of the}} estuary. Increasing the amplitude of the tidal oscillation, progressively higher bed slopes are experienced at the mouth while the river-dominated portion of the estuary experiences an increasing bed degradation. The fluvial-marine transition is identified by a “tidal length” that increases monotonically as the river discharge and the corresponding sediment supply are increased while the river attains a new morphological equilibrium configuration. Tidal length also increases if, for a fixed river discharge and tidal amplitude, the sediment flux is progressively reduced with respect to the transport capacity. In the case of funnel-shaped estuaries the tidal length strongly decreases, aggradation is triggered by channel widening, and tidal effects are such to enhance the slope at the inlet and the net degradation of the river bed. Finally, results suggest that alluvial estuaries in morphological equilibrium cannot experience any amplification of the tidal wave propagating landward. Hence, hypersynchronous alluvial estuaries cannot be in equilibrium...|$|E
