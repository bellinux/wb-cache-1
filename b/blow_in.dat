5|$|Despite {{being more}} popular than some men's {{football}} events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd), women's football in England suffered a <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, {{on the grounds that}} the game (as played by women) was distasteful. Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted. This led to the formation of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.|$|E

5|$|As {{the winner}} of 2015–16 I-League, Bengaluru FC were paired against 8th ranked team Aizawl F.C. for the quarter-final round. On 30 April 2016, in {{the first leg of}} quarter finals, Bengaluru FC took an early lead in 15th minute with a goal from Eugeneson Lyngdoh, however Alfred Jaryan {{equalized}} for the home team in 38th minute. Aizawl struck the final <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> the dying minutes when Joel Sunday scored the winner for the home team, leaving Bengaluru FC trailing after the first leg. Bengaluru FC suffered a shock defeat in the home leg as well, as the team went down 2–3 to Aizawl. C.K. Vineeth's first half equalizer and Sunil Chhetri's successful penalty proved insufficient as Bengaluru FC were ousted from the Federation cup on 3–5 aggregate loss.|$|E

At one time the factory employed around 3,000 people, although at the time of closure this had been reduced to just 250.

Wavell {{intended to}} create advantageous conditions {{from which to}} launch Operation Battleaxe, the main offensive that he was planning for June. Operation Brevity's primary objectives were to recapture the Halfaya Pass, to drive the enemy from the Sollum and Capuzzo areas, and to deplete Rommel's forces. A secondary objective was to advance toward Tobruk, although {{only as far as}} supplies would allow, and without risking the force committed to the operation.|$|E
5|$|In {{a special}} congressional {{election}} held June 20, Unionist candidates won nine of Kentucky's ten congressional seats. Confederate sympathizers won only the Jackson Purchase region, which was economically linked to Tennessee by the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers. Believing defeat {{at the polls}} was certain, many Southern Rightists had boycotted the election; of the 125,000 votes cast, Unionists captured close to 90,000. Confederate sympathizers were dealt a further <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> the August 5 election for state legislators. This election resulted in veto-proof Unionist majorities of 76–24 in the House and 27–11 in the Senate. From then on, most of Magoffin's vetoes to protect southern interests were overridden in the General Assembly.|$|E

The new Byzantine emperor, Basil I the Macedonian (r. 867–886), sent an embassy for negotiations to Tephrike. After the talks failed, Basil led a campaign against the Paulician state in the spring of 871, but was defeated and only narrowly managed to escape himself.|$|E

5|$|After the Holland fight, Dyer {{made several}} {{attempts}} at a rematch with Darcy, reportedly {{to the exclusion}} of other fights, in the belief that the encounter would draw a big crowd and a large purse. The postponed fight with Delmen was again mooted, but this too never occurred. In the meantime Dyer continued to busy himself with charity work, setting up a boxing fund for injured soldiers in Sydney, and continued to tour the vaudeville circuit in New South Wales. Dyer's persistence eventually paid off, and an encounter with Darcy was arranged for 9 October at Rushcutters Bay Stadium, with the Middleweight Championship title at stake. The fight was a one-sided affair, with Dyer outclassed throughout. Although Darcy was warned for a low <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> the fourth round, Dyer was never in the fight and his corner threw in the towel after one minute of the sixth round.|$|E
5|$|In Kentucky, the Americans {{went on the}} {{defensive}} while Caldwell and his Indian allies prepared a major offensive. In July 1782, more than 1,000 Indians gathered at Wapatomica, but the expedition {{came to a halt}} after scouts reported that George Rogers Clark was preparing to invade the Ohio Country from Kentucky. Most of the Indians dispersed after learning that the reports of imminent invasion were false, but Caldwell led 300 Indians into Kentucky and delivered a devastating blow at the Battle of Blue Licks in August. After his victory at Blue Licks, Caldwell was ordered to cease operations because the United States and Great Britain were about to make peace. Although General Irvine had finally gotten permission to lead his own expedition into the Ohio Country, rumors of the peace treaty killed enthusiasm for the undertaking, which never took place. In November, George Rogers Clark delivered the final <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> the Ohio Country, destroying several Shawnee towns, but inflicting little damage on the inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Pope's {{reputation}} {{suffered a}} serious <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> 1879 when a late-convened Board of Inquiry called by President Rutherford B. Hayes {{and led by}} Maj. Gen. John Schofield (Pope's immediate predecessor in the Department of the Missouri and then head of the Department of the Pacific) concluded that Major General Fitz John Porter had been unfairly convicted of cowardice and disobedience at the Second Battle of Bull Run. The Schofield report used evidence of former Confederate commanders and concluded that Pope himself bore most {{of the responsibility for}} the Union loss. The report characterized Pope as reckless and dangerously uninformed about events during the battle, also criticized General Irvin McDowell (whom Pope detested), and credited Porter's perceived disobedience with saving the Union army from complete ruin. Soon, Schofield himself was criticized for his actions as superintendent of the U.S. Military at West Point following the hazing of an African American cadet.|$|E

5|$|The sea {{plays a part}} in {{the water}} cycle, in which water evaporates from the ocean, travels through the {{atmosphere}} as vapor, condenses, falls (usually as rain or snow) again, and then largely returns to the sea. Even in the Atacama Desert, where little rain ever falls, dense clouds of fog known as the camanchaca <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> from the sea and support plant life. In large land masses, geologic features can block the access of some regions to the main sea. These endorheic basins, particularly in central Asia, sometimes build up permanent salt lakes as inflowing waters evaporate and their dissolved minerals accumulate over time. The largest of these is the Caspian Sea, although it is sometimes counted as a proper sea owing to its basin of (now-landlocked) oceanic crust. Other notable examples include the Aral Sea in central Asia and the Great Salt Lake in the western United States. The waters of these basins still eventually return to the sea through evaporation, the flow of ground water, and (over geologic time) the opening up of the basins by continental drift.|$|E
5|$|The {{circulation}} in Venus's troposphere follows the so-called cyclostrophic approximation. Its windspeeds are roughly {{determined by the}} balance of the pressure gradient and centrifugal forces in almost purely zonal flow. In contrast, the {{circulation in}} the Earth's atmosphere is governed by the geostrophic balance. Venus's windspeeds can be directly measured only in the upper troposphere (tropopause), between 60–70km, altitude, which corresponds to the upper cloud deck. The cloud motion is usually observed in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, where the contrast between clouds is the highest. The linear wind speeds at this level are about 100±10m/s at lower than 50° latitude. They are retrograde {{in the sense that they}} <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> the direction of the retrograde rotation of the planet. The winds quickly decrease towards the higher latitudes, eventually reaching zero at the poles. Such strong cloud-top winds cause a phenomenon known as the super-rotation of the atmosphere. In other words, these high-speed winds circle the whole planet faster than the planet itself rotates. The super-rotation on Venus is differential, which means that the equatorial troposphere super-rotates more slowly than the troposphere at the midlatitudes. The winds also have a strong vertical gradient. They decline deep in the troposphere with the rate of 3m/sperkm. The winds near the surface of Venus are much slower than that on Earth. They actually move at only a few kilometres per hour (generally less than 2m/s and with an average of 0.3 to 1.0m/s), but due to the high density of the atmosphere at the surface, this is still enough to transport dust and small stones across the surface, much like a slow-moving current of water.|$|E
