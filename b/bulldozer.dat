5|$|After the accident, {{souvenir}} hunters {{proved to}} be such a problem that the owners of Berry Brow kept all gates locked. Geoff Inkpen stated that after completion of an Inquiry a <b>bulldozer</b> would be used to dig a ditch at the crash site and what remained of the Amana would be buried.|$|E
5|$|Eglin steel uses a {{combination}} of over a dozen different elements in varying amounts to create a relatively low-cost steel for use in bunker buster weapons. Hadfield steel (after Sir Robert Hadfield) or manganese steel contains 12–14% manganese which when abraded strain-hardens to form an incredibly hard skin which resists wearing. Examples include tank tracks, <b>bulldozer</b> blade edges and cutting blades on the jaws of life.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the parish}} was {{in desperate need}} of a new rectory and the new project was begun in 1944. An engineer, Frank H. Recco, was the {{technical}} advisor of the project. Parishioners borrowed a <b>bulldozer</b> from the John F. Casey Company in Aspinwall, and a steam shovel from the Burrell Construction and Supply Company of New Kensington; and they dug the foundation for a two-level building.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, the {{original}} earthmoving <b>bulldozers</b> are still irreplaceable as their tasks {{are concentrated in}} deforestation, earthmoving, ground levelling, and road carving. Heavy <b>bulldozers</b> are mainly employed to level the terrain to prepare it for construction. The construction, however, is mainly done by small <b>bulldozers</b> and loader tractors.|$|R
50|$|Between the wars, D9 <b>bulldozers</b> were {{employed}} in earthworks, fortifications buildings, opening routes and clearing explosive charges. During the late 1980s Israeli-made armor was installed on the D9L <b>bulldozers</b> that were in IDF service. Improved armor kits were designed and installed on the D9N <b>bulldozers</b> during the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|The Islamic State {{has used}} {{armoured}} <b>bulldozers,</b> including civilian <b>bulldozers</b> up-armoured with steel plate and slat armour, capable of withstanding small arms fire and even rocket propelled grenades, as SVBIED's or suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices. The tonnes of explosives packed into these armoured <b>bulldozers</b> {{are capable of}} destroying entire buildings.|$|R
5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve the Australian line of {{communications}} in the sector, engineers from the 16th Field Company later constructed a road using a <b>bulldozer</b> that had to haul itself up the ridge via a steel cable that was manhandled {{up to a point}} just below the ridge over the course of eight days. A light rail system was also established between Barges' Hill and Pearl Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Marge asks Belle {{to close}} down the burlesque house, but Belle refuses, saying that {{the house is a}} part of Springfield. At a town meeting, Marge brings up the matter and shows {{pictures}} of several prominent citizens leaving. They form a mob so they can go destroy the burlesque house. The mob arrives at the house and immediately starts destroying things. Bart and Homer arrive and Homer decides to try to convince the mob to stop. He does so by singing a musical number accompanied by Belle and some of her dancers. The town soon joins in and are convinced to let the house stay. However, Marge arrives with a <b>bulldozer,</b> having missed the song. The town announces their intentions to let the house stay, but Marge tries to sing her own song about her views. During the opening lines, she accidentally puts the <b>bulldozer</b> into drive and destroys a wing of the burlesque house. She apologizes profusely and, to pay for the damage, she starts a ventriloquist act at the house.|$|E
5|$|The 2/28th Battalion probed {{into the}} Pocket on 16 June. The {{previous}} day a 2/11th Commando Squadron patrol had {{reported that the}} track along Lyon Ridge would be passable by tanks if a bomb crater was filled, and {{on the morning of}} the 16th A Company from the 2/28th Battalion accompanied by a troop of three tanks and a <b>bulldozer</b> began to move south along it. After the <b>bulldozer</b> filled the crater, the force continued along Lyon Ridge but became pinned down by heavy fire from Japanese troops on Eastman Spur to the south-east of the ridge. One of the Australian tanks was damaged. A subsequent attempt by a section from the 2/11th Commando Squadron to advance towards Eastman Spur to the east of A Company was also beaten back, with two Australians killed and another wounded. A Company resumed its advance during the afternoon, supported by a new troop of tanks. The three tanks moved ahead of the infantry, and killed eight or ten Japanese personnel, but one was damaged by a bomb and another became bogged. By the end of the day, A Company had suffered five men killed and 23 wounded. Overall, 150 patients were admitted by the 24th Brigade's attached medical units during 16 June, which stretched their capacity.|$|E
50|$|The US Army used D9 <b>bulldozers</b> {{to clear}} {{forest in the}} Vietnam War but after the war, they were {{replaced}} with smaller and cheaper Caterpillar D7G <b>bulldozers.</b> D7G <b>bulldozers</b> are still very common in US combat engineering battalions, {{but there is a}} series of oft-recurrent suggestions to replace the lighter D7Gs with the newer and more heavily armored D9s.|$|R
50|$|On September 3, 2016, during Labor Day weekend, the Dakota Access Pipeline {{brought in}} a private {{security}} firm when the company used <b>bulldozers</b> to dig up part of the pipeline route that contained possible Native graves and burial artifacts; it was subject to a pending injunction motion. The <b>bulldozers</b> arrived within {{a day after the}} tribe filed legal action. Energy Transfer <b>bulldozers</b> cut a two-mile (3200 m) long, 150-foot (45 m) wide path through the contested area.|$|R
50|$|Most often <b>bulldozers</b> {{are large}} and {{powerful}} tracked heavy equipment. The tracks give them excellent ground holding capability and mobility through very rough terrain. Wide tracks help distribute the <b>bulldozer's</b> weight over a large area (decreasing ground pressure), thus preventing it from sinking in sandy or muddy ground. Extra wide tracks are known as swamp tracks or LGP (low ground pressure) tracks. <b>Bulldozers</b> have transmission systems designed {{to take advantage of}} the track system and provide excellent tractive force.|$|R
5|$|Blast Corps is a single-player action video game. The player {{controls}} {{vehicles to}} destroy buildings, farms, and other {{structures in the}} path of a runaway nuclear missile carrier. The player fails if the carrier collides with an object. The eight demolition vehicles vary in the way they clear structures: the <b>bulldozer</b> rams, the dump truck drifts, the lightweight buggy crashes from higher ground, the tricycle shoots missiles, another truck presses outwards from its sides, and robot mechs tumble and stomp from the land and the air. The player must transfer between vehicles and other machinery to solve puzzles. Objectives include transporting timed explosive crates and bridging gaps. The game's puzzles increase in difficulty as the player progresses through its 57 levels.|$|E
5|$|At about 18:00, {{the prisoners}} were divided into groups. Each group of 10 to 20 was loaded onto a truck and transported several hundred metres (yards) from the {{building}} towards a wooded ravine. When the prisoners reached the previously prepared execution site, they were shot and buried in a mass grave using a <b>bulldozer.</b> After 15–20 minutes, the truck would return empty {{to pick up the}} next group. The final group of prisoners was executed just outside the farm building itself. By 22:00 that evening, all of the prisoners had been killed. Most sources place the number of victims at around 260. This figure has been used by ICTY prosecutors. Some estimates of the death toll go as high as 264. The Croatian authorities believe that the total figure stands at 261. The massacre was the most severe individual war crime committed in Europe since World War II until that point.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, The Guinness Book of World Records {{recognized}} Vulović as {{the world}} record holder for surviving the highest fall without a parachute. She was fired from JAT in 1990 after taking part in anti-government protests, but avoided arrest because the government {{was concerned about the}} negative publicity that her imprisonment would bring. She continued her work as a pro-democracy activist until the Socialist Party of Serbia was ousted from power during the <b>Bulldozer</b> Revolution of October 2000. Vulović later campaigned on behalf of the Democratic Party of Serbia, advocating Serbia's entry into the European Union. The final years of her life were spent in seclusion and she continued to struggle with survivor's guilt. Having divorced, she lived alone in her Belgrade apartment on a small pension until her death in 2016.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bulldozers</b> {{employed}} for combat engineering roles are often fitted with armor {{to protect the}} driver from firearms and debris, enabling <b>bulldozers</b> to operate in combat zones. The most widely documented use is the Israeli Defence Forces' (IDF) militarized Caterpillar D9, for earth moving, clearing terrain obstacles, opening routes, detonating explosive charges. The extensive use of armored <b>bulldozers</b> during the Second Intifada drew controversy and criticism from human rights organizations while military experts {{saw it as a}} key factor in reducing IDF casualties.|$|R

5|$|Milošević's term {{in office}} in Yugoslavia {{was coming to an}} end, and the {{elections}} that came on September 24, 2000, were protested due to allegations of fraud and rigged elections. This all came to a head on October 5 in the so-called <b>Bulldozer</b> Revolution. Milošević resigned on October 7. The Democratic Opposition of Serbia won a majority in parliamentary elections that December. Milošević was taken into custody on April 1, 2001, and transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on June 28 to face charges of war crimes and genocide. Clark was called to testify in a closed session of Milošević's trial in December 2003. He testified on issues ranging from the Srebrenica massacre to conversations Clark had had with Milošević during his career. Some anti-war activist groups also label Clark and Bill Clinton (along with several others) as war criminals for NATO's entire bombing campaign, saying the entire operation was in violation of the NATO charter.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the bones}} {{collected}} were encased in siltstone nodules surrounded by fine sand and silt, with the rest lying in clay. The bones were disarticulated and scattered over a 5 x 2m (17 x 8ft) area, but most were not far from their natural positions. The position of some bones was disturbed by a <b>bulldozer,</b> and some were broken by mechanical equipment before they were collected. Preparing the specimen was difficult, due to the hardness of the siltstone matrix {{and the presence of}} siderite; acid preparation was attempted, but most of the matrix was removed mechanically. The skeleton consisted of partial skull bones; teeth; cervical, dorsal and caudal vertebrae; ribs; a sternum; coracoids; arm and hand bones; claws; hip bones, and leg bones. The original specimen number was BMNH R9951, but it was later re-catalogued as NHMUK VP R9951.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the site was first {{brought to the attention}} of Professor Richard Daugherty in 1952 by a rancher named John McGregor. Excavations at the site were started by Daugherty and Roald Fryxell, a geologist, under the auspices of Washington State University (WSU)and the National Park Service in 1962, and continued until 1964. In 1965, Fryxell returned to the site along with Professor Carl Gustafson and students from WSU, and had Roland Marmes dig a trench in front of the rockshelter with his <b>bulldozer,</b> which turned up human and elk bones. Radiocarbon dating indicated that the human remains were about 10,000 years old. In 1968, Fryxell returned, this time with several WSU professors (including a visiting professor from Poland) and members of the United States Geological Survey, and found more human and animal remains, along with bone tools. April 29 of that year, Washington Senator Warren Magnuson made a public announcement of the finds.|$|E

5|$|At {{first light}} a {{clearing}} patrol from D Company, 3 RAR swept {{the area with}} tanks and APCs in support, killing and capturing a number of attackers that had been pinned down in old B-52 bomb craters {{to the north of}} Balmoral. The daylight revealed that the North Vietnamese had once again been soundly defeated leaving 42 dead and seven prisoners, while Australian losses were one killed and eight wounded. Quantities of weapons, clothing, ammunition and equipment were also recovered by the Australians. Phillips was subsequently awarded the Military Cross for his leadership during the battle. Many of the North Vietnamese dead were teenagers of 16 or 17 years, evidence that the PAVN had begun drafting 15-year-old boys into its combat units; as had happened after the earlier fighting, their bodies were collected by a <b>bulldozer</b> and buried in a mass grave. Later, a large number of shell scrapes were discovered to the north-east of Balmoral during an aerial reconnaissance by a Sioux light observation helicopter, and they were thought likely to have been used by the North Vietnamese as an assembly area before being engaged by artillery firing defensive fire tasks early in the battle. The successful defence of Balmoral and the high ratio of North Vietnamese killed had confirmed the judgement of MacDonald and Dunstan and validated the decision to adopt an aggressive defence with strong static positions and forceful patrolling. The failed assault proved to be the final attempt to remove 1 ATF from AO Surfers, and there were no further attacks by the North Vietnamese against either Coral or Balmoral.|$|E

25|$|<b>Bulldozer</b> is AMD's {{microarchitecture}} codename {{for server}} and desktop AMD FX processors first released on October 12, 2011. This family 15h microarchitecture is {{the successor to}} the family 10h (K10) microarchitecture design. <b>Bulldozer</b> is designed from scratch, not a development of earlier processors. The core is specifically aimed at 10–125W TDP computing products. AMD claims dramatic performance-per-watt efficiency improvements in high-performance computing (HPC) applications with <b>Bulldozer</b> cores. While hopes were very high that <b>Bulldozer</b> would bring AMD to be performance competitive with archrival Intel once more, most benchmarks were disappointing. In some cases the new <b>Bulldozer</b> products were slower than the K10 model they were built to replace.|$|E
