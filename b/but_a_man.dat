5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the Son of God was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E
5|$|His public enemies, {{even the}} men who {{directed}} the fatal shot, ne'er spoke or wrote of him without expressions of marked respect; those whom he commanded loved him even to idolatry; and I, his associate and commander, fail in words adequate to express my opinion of his great worth.

5|$|There {{are several}} local {{traditional}} {{stories about the}} megalithic complex. The best known tells how a wedding party was turned to stone: the party was held throughout Saturday, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> clothed in black (the Devil in disguise) came and started to play his violin for the merrymakers after midnight, continuing into holy Sunday morning. When dawn broke, everybody had been turned to stone by the Demon: so the stone circles are the dancers, the avenues are the fiddlers and The Cove is the bride and the groom with the drunken churchman at their feet. They are still awaiting the Devil who promised to come back someday and play again for them.|$|E

Although rough in style, partisan in character and sometimes incorrect in detail, the books are the work {{of a man who had}} an intimate knowledge of the events which he relates, who possessed a clear and virile mind, and who above all was not a recluse <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of action.

25|$|With {{his novels}} {{providing}} scant income, Thompson turned to {{other forms of}} writing to pay the bills. Beginning in 1959, and continuing through the mid-1960s, Thompson also began writing television programs, including episodes of the action/adventure shows Mackenzie's Raiders (1959), Cain's Hundred (1961) and Convoy (1965). TV work seemingly dried up for Thompson after this point, so he turned to writing tie-in novels based on produced TV shows and screenplays: this work paid a flat fee, and could be completed quickly. Thompson's tie-ins include an original novel based on the TV series Ironside (1967), as well as screenplay novelizations of the films The Undefeated (1969) and Nothing <b>But</b> <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> (1970).|$|E
25|$|The {{reign of}} King Sigismund III of Poland is often spoken {{of as the}} {{beginning}} of the end of the Polish Golden Age. In terms of worldly success he certainly met with many defeats and setbacks. Yet, he was also one of the great Catholic leaders of Europe and his reign can also be seen as one of many opportunities for an even greater Poland. He was stubborn, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of principle who would follow the hard but upright path rather than compromise his values for a more sure chance at success. As a monarch who reigned during the Counter-Reformation he constantly worked to see the restoration of all of his subjects to the true faith embodied in the Church of Rome headed by the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E

The New York Times reported that he was arrested many times as an accomplice in homicide, robbery and less important charges, but had never been convicted. According to the Italian newspaper La Stampa, Alfano did spent {{six or seven years}} in prison, where he earned his initiation as a camorrista, which gave him the [...] "right" [...] to demand a tangente, protection money, from the merchants in the neighbourhood he controlled.|$|E
500|$|This {{sequence}} {{plays an}} important part in the gospel's literary narrative. The author of Mark's gospel has been described as operating here [...] "at the peak of his rhetorical and theological powers". One suggestion is that the darkness is a deliberate inversion of the transfiguration; alternately, Jesus's earlier discourse about a future tribulation mentions the sun being darkened, and can be seen as foreshadowing this scene. Striking details such as the darkening of the sky and the tearing of the temple veil may be a way of focusing the reader away from the shame and humiliation [...] of the crucifixion; one professor of biblical theology concluded, [...] "it is clear that Jesus is not a humiliated criminal <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of great significance. His death is therefore not a sign of his weakness but of his power." ...|$|E

They liked him for his cheerfulness and desire to entertain, an attitude not shared by all of his team-mates. He had many friends in the game at {{a time when}} Yorkshire were not always welcome in other counties due to their on-field attitude. When he was chosen as a Bowler of the Year in 1924, Wisden remarked that he was devoted to the game, possessed a cheery temperament and stood out among players for his personality, while his obituary described him as modest and generous. His Times obituary described him as [...] "not only a notable exponent of the game, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of rare charm.

500|$|During the French and Indian Wars, the British {{military}} {{improved the}} road significantly {{for use by}} its forces. After the war it was used by numerous settlers moving west into the Mohawk Valley. During the late-18th century, taverns and the occasional homesteader began to dot the Pine Bush along the King's Highway, while development began to encroach on the Pine Bush at the Albany and Schenectady edges as those settlements began to grow. The highway and the Pine Bush was a frontier wilderness and extremely dangerous even {{after the end of}} the war. Starting in 1765, militiamen took turns escorting travelers through the area to protect them from outlaws, bandits, smugglers, and other dangers. During the American Revolutionary War, the Bush was home to Loyalists of the British Crown. Among the taverns established in the 1760s catering to Pine Bush travelers was the Truax Tavern owned by Isaac Truax, a descendant of French Huguenots and a Tory sympathizer; he said that he was [...] "not a Tory, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> for the King". Rumors circulated of several murders/robberies being carried out at the tavern.|$|E
500|$|Eastern Tamils are an agrarian-based society. They {{follow a}} caste system {{similar to the}} South Indian or Dravidian kinship system. The Eastern Tamil caste {{hierarchy}} {{is dominated by the}} Mukkuvar, Paravar and Karaiyar [...] The main feature of their society is the kuti system. Although the Tamil word kuti means a house or settlement, in eastern Sri Lanka it is related to matrimonial alliances. It refers to the exogamous matrilineal clans and is found amongst most caste groups. Men or women remain members of the kuti of their birth and be brother or sister by relation. No man can marry in the same kuti because woman is always become sister to him. <b>But,</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> can only marry in one of his sampantha kutis not in the sakothara kutis. By custom, children born in a family belong to mother's kuti. Kuti also collectively own places of worship such as Hindu temples. [...] Each caste contains a number of kutis, with varying names. Aside from castes with an internal kuti system, there are seventeen caste groups, called Ciraikutis, or imprisoned kutis, whose members were considered to be in captivity, confined to specific services such as washing, weaving, and toddy tapping. However, such restrictions no longer apply.|$|E
500|$|In a daylong trip, {{the party}} reached the next station located [...] north {{by the second}} watch of the night. Heavy rains and wind made further advance impossible, but despite rain on the next day, Zhai Yong urged Choe and the Koreans to push on regardless, {{explaining}} that the regulations for prompt arrival times in China's courier system were very stringent. The party covered another [...] on March 11, completely soaked by the rain {{when they reached the}} next station. The station master provided the party with a small fire to keep warm, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who thought the Koreans were captured pirates barged in and kicked their fire out in a rage. Zhai Yong dutifully wrote an account of this assault and passed it on to the county magistrate's office before having the party continue en route to their destination on the following day, March 12. They reached the Beidu River on that day, boarding ships that would lead them to the Grand Canal, the central courier and trade artery of China that would carry them all the way to Beijing. At this point, water transport was the preferable means of travel for the courier agents; Choe wrote [...] "all envoys, tribute, and commerce come and go by water. If either the water in the locks and rivers is too shallow because of drought to let boats pass or there is a very urgent matter, the overland route is taken." [...] When the party reached Ningbo on that day, Choe Bu remarked on the beautiful scenery; when they reached Cixi City, he noted the city's many markets and cluttering of warships; upon entering Ningbo and reaching the Supreme Piracy-Defense Office, Choe wrote that the gates and crowds there were three times as great as at Cixi.|$|E

500|$|In October 1562 the Queen {{fell ill}} with {{smallpox}} and, believing {{her life to}} be in danger, she asked the Privy Council to make Robert Dudley Protector of the Realm and {{to give him a}} suitable title together with twenty thousand pounds a year. There was universal relief when she recovered her health; Dudley was made a privy councillor. He was already deeply involved in foreign politics, including Scotland. In 1563 Elizabeth suggested Dudley as a consort to the widowed Mary, Queen of Scots, the idea being to achieve firm amity between England and Scotland and diminish the influence of foreign powers. Elizabeth's preferred solution was that they should all live together at the English court, so that she would not have to forgo her favourite's company. Mary of Scotland at first enquired if Elizabeth was serious, wanting above all to know her chances of inheriting the English crown. Elizabeth repeatedly declared that she was only prepared to acknowledge Mary as her heir on condition that she marry Robert Dudley. Mary's Protestant advisors warmed to the prospect of having Dudley as their prince, and in September 1564 he was created Earl of Leicester, a move designed to make him more acceptable to Mary. In January 1565 Thomas Randolph, the English ambassador to Scotland, was told by the Scottish queen that she would accept the proposal. To his amazement, Dudley was not to be moved to comply: <b>But</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of that nature I never found any ... he whom I go about to make as happy as ever was any, to put him in possession of a kingdom, to lay in his naked arms a most fair ... lady ... nothing regardeth the good that shall ensue unto him thereby ... but so uncertainly dealeth that I know not where to find him. Dudley indeed had made it clear to the Scots at the beginning that he was not a candidate for Mary's hand and forthwith had behaved with passive resistance. He also worked in the interest of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, Mary's eventual choice of husband. Elizabeth herself wavered as to declaring Mary her heir, until in March 1565 she decided she could not bring herself to it. Still, she finally told the Spanish ambassador that the proposal fell through because the Earl of Leicester refused to cooperate.|$|E
