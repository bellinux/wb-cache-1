In 2009, however, the all-amateur Smart Gilas team became the country's official representative in international competitions.

Aside from improving the physical environment and setup, Tamano also revolutionized some of the existing policies and instituted reforms at the PLM, such as the implementing of stricter admission and retention policies, providing of tenures of office for deans of each school, upgrading of the wage and non-wage benefits of employees, and enforcing of zero tolerance on corruption, such as placing measures that would keep bidding and contract-awarding transparent and open to scrutiny.|$|E
25|$|By 6 February 1972, {{the militia}} {{garrison}} at Bouamlong had been organized as a regiment—Groupement Mobile 27 (GM 27). Once again, Bouamlong {{served as a}} launch site for a Royalist offensive as they once again tried to interdict Communist logistics. They were {{a key part of}} the diversion that drew 11 Communist battalions from attacking Long Tieng. After withdrawing from the pursuing Communists, GM 27 was scheduled to again take the offensive in Operation Strength II on 6 March. However, reinforcements being flown in to <b>beef</b> <b>up</b> the attack mutinied. Such reinforcements as did arrive struck south towards toward the Routes 7/71 road junction. By 30 March, GM 27 joined them in their overlook of the highways.|$|E
25|$|On 4 October, an {{approaching}} crowd of refugees was mistaken for PAVN by BC 203; the Royalist irregulars fled to Moung Phalan. Nearby Yellow Battalion followed suit, abandoning its hilltop stronghold. Early on 6 October, not knowing Moung Phine had been abandoned, a company from Red Battalion was airlifted into an ambush on the airstrip. Two 20th SOS helicopters were downed on the runway, stranding eight USAF fliers and 44 Lao troops. Scavenging four M60 machine guns from the crashed helicopters to <b>beef</b> <b>up</b> their defense, the fliers and the Red Battalion soldiers held off the PAVN all day.

25|$|Although the Soviet Union did not {{contribute}} directly {{to the development of}} the RLAF, its actions in 1960-1961 had a great influence on RLAF development. In response to an appeal for help from Kong Le, the Soviet Union dedicated 44 transport aircraft to support of the Neutralist forces. Beginning in December 1960, the Soviets flew in military supplies, beginning with a battery of 105mm howitzers. The Russians flew about 1,000 sorties by March 1961 in support of the Neutralists even as they withdrew northward onto the Plaine des Jarres. The Soviet effort included some drops of Kong Le's paratroopers, as well as the provision of three Lisunov Li-2s to his air force. During the same time frame, the Vietnam People's Air Force's 919th Transport Regiment flew 184 resupply sorties from northern Vietnam into Sam Neua. The communist efforts sparked American efforts to <b>beef</b> <b>up</b> the RLAF.|$|E
25|$|Fane's Anglo-Spanish naval {{expedition}} struck {{first on}} 10 September. An amphibious force rowed ashore at Begur and captured 50 {{men and a}} coastal artillery emplacement. Alerted by this raid, General of Brigade François Xavier de Schwarz ordered his coastal units to <b>beef</b> <b>up</b> their defenses. His brigade comprised two battalions each of the 5th Confederation of the Rhine (Anhalt-Lippe) and 6th Confederation of the Rhine (Schwarzburg-Waldeck-Reuss) Regiments. The brigade numbered 1,700 men with 18 artillery pieces. Schwarz posted 800 men and his headquarters at La Bisbal d'Empordà while {{the remainder of the}} brigade was spread out to defend Begur, Calonge, Palamós, and Sant Feliu de Guíxols. Still undetected, O'Donnell arrived at the village of Vidreres with 6,000 foot soldiers and 400 cavalrymen on 13 September 1810. Another authority counted 6,600 men in the Spanish force, including the Kayser Swiss Regiment, Numancia Dragoons, and miquelets.|$|E
25|$|To {{complete}} its assignments, the 82nd Airborne Division {{was divided into}} three forces. Gavin commanded Force A (parachute): the three parachute infantry regiments and support detachments. The drops were scattered by bad weather and German antiaircraft fire over an area {{three to four times}} larger than planned; ironically, this gave the Germans the impression of a much larger force. Two regiments of the division were given the mission of blocking approaches west of the Merderet River, but most of their troops missed their drop zones entirely. The 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment jumped accurately and captured its objective, the town of Sainte-Mère-Église, which proved essential {{to the success of the}} division.The 1st Battalion captured bridges over the Merderet at Manoir de la Fière and Chef-du-Pont. Gavin returned from Chef-du-Pont and withdrew all but a platoon to <b>beef</b> <b>up</b> the defense at Manoir de la Fière. About 2.2 miles west of Sainte-Mère-Église and 175 yards east of La Fière Bridge, on Route D15, a historical marker indicates the supposed location of Gavin's foxhole.|$|E

25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in Europe, the SSRNVR increased the recruitment of mainly indigenous personnel into the force, to <b>beef</b> <b>up</b> local defences as Royal Navy resources were required in Europe. Members of the SSRNVR were called up to active duty, and the force was augmented by members of the Royal Navy Malay Section. This formed the basis of the navy in Malaya, called the Malay Navy, manned by indigenous Malay personnel. (Similarly, the Malays were recruited into the fledgling Malay Regiment formed in 1936). The Malay Navy had a strength of 400 men who received their training at , the Royal Navy training establishment in Malaya. Recruitment was increased and in 1941 at {{the outbreak}} of the war in Asia, the Malay Navy had a strength of 1,450 men. Throughout the Second World War, the Malay Navy served with the Allied Forces in the Indian and Pacific theatre of operations. When the war ended with the Japanese Surrender in 1945, only 600 personnel of the Malay Navy reported for muster. Post war economic constraints saw the disbandment of the Malay Navy in 1947.|$|E

500|$|Several {{days before}} the summit, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer {{described}} Afghanistan as [...] "priority number one". During the summit, NATO members officially agreed that the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) would take on command of four additional Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) (one in Mazar-e-Sharif, Meymana, Feyzabad and Baghlan), falling short of the initial target of five. Until then ISAF only provided security in around the capital city Kabul and commanded one PRT in Kunduz. The 26 members agreed to contribute between them an additional 600 troops (23.08 per country) and three helicopters to the Afghan mission. The three helicopters came from Turkey, and had gone back within three months. NATO also vowed to <b>beef</b> <b>up</b> its Afghanistan peace force from 6,500 to 10,000 {{to help make the}} Afghan presidential election, 2004 secure, but no actual agreement for that many additional troops was made.|$|E
500|$|IGN gave a more mixed {{review of}} Dignity, giving it 6.9 out of 10. They praised {{what they felt}} was Duff's more mature image, but {{ultimately}} claimed, [...] "Duff is still Duff and her music is still running the standard pop line." [...] PopMatters noted that the synthesizers used on the album's tracks failed to disguise Duff's speak-singing. The website believed her vocals {{were not on the}} level of her pop music peers such as Kelly Clarkson and Mandy Moore. [...] "Nevertheless," [...] they added, [...] "thanks to the miracle of processing, reverb effects, and multi-tracking tricks to <b>beef</b> <b>up</b> her vocals, Duff's voice is still sweetly candy-coated enough to make the medicine go down." [...] Slant Magazine said, [...] "Duff is mostly just an anonymous voice for an assemblage of producers and songwriters. Which is perfectly acceptable for a self-proclaimed dance album, but Duff's voice is nondescript and her delivery is blank; the impish, quirky, or coolly disaffected vocal characteristics and sex appeal that make other dance-pop divas viable performers is nonexistent." [...] The website's review claimed that the album was not very adventurous, and noted that the pop rock [...] "Outside of You", which they felt was the catchiest song on Dignity, was not a dance song like the others.|$|E
