30|$|In Fig.  4 {{we could}} not {{estimate}} the absolute intensity of 630 -nm airglow. To calculate the absolute intensity, we need to subtract the <b>background</b> continuum <b>emission</b> which is measured at a wavelength of 572.5  nm. This procedure contains an assumption that the intensity of <b>background</b> continuum <b>emission</b> including city lights is the same at 572.5 and at 630.0  nm. However, at Chiang Mai, the subtraction of <b>background</b> continuum <b>emission</b> resulted in negative value of 630.0 -nm airglow intensity. This fact suggests that the assumption of the same intensity of <b>background</b> continuum <b>emission</b> at 572.5 and 630.0  nm may be not correct. If contamination of scattered city lights contributes to the <b>background</b> continuum <b>emission,</b> this spectral dependence would occur above Chiang Mai. Since we do not measure the intensity of <b>background</b> continuum <b>emission</b> at wavelengths near 630.0  nm, {{we could not}} estimate the absolute intensity of the 630.0 -nm airglow emission. Because the output count of CCD {{is proportional to the}} 630.0 -nm airglow intensity, and because the read-out noise of the CCD is less than 10 counts (rms), which corresponds to the 630.0 -nm intensity of less than 0.3 R, we can identify variations of 630 -nm airglow intensity of more than 0.3 R in the imager in Chiang Mai from these raw count images in Fig.  4. Thus, we conclude that there are no discernible wave structures at Chiang Mai in the plotted interval.|$|R
50|$|The {{seeker head}} of 9M31, however, {{utilizes}} the PbS elements differently from usual.

The method is called optical photocontrast homing (Rus.: фотоконтрастное наведение). The advantage of photocontrast homing method over traditional heat-seeking homing heads using PbS elements is that it negates the most serious drawback of early-generation IR-homing missiles: complete lack of front-aspect engagement capability against approaching jets. Even early cooled seeker heads had usually only limited forward hemisphere engagement abilities, often reducing to zero in case of jets approaching exactly towards the shooter.|$|E

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{aviation}} {{is critical to the}} world and US economy, and it faces several important challenges among which lie the environmental impacts of aviation on noise, climate and air quality. The first objective of this thesis addresses the requirements of section 753 of the US Energy Policy Act, and entails the quantification of present and future-year regional air quality impacts of US Landing and Take-Off (LTO) aviation emissions. In addition, this thesis characterizes the sensitivity of these impacts to variations in the projection of non-aviation anthropogenic emissions (referred to as <b>background</b> <b>emissions).</b> Finally, the implication of a future-year <b>background</b> <b>emissions</b> scenario on the current policy analysis tool, the response surface model (RSMv 2), is discussed. Aviation emissions for 2006 are generated using the Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT), while future-year aviation emissions are developed for 2020 and 2030 using the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Terminal Area Forecast (TAF) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP/ 8) NOx Stringency scenario # 6. <b>Background</b> <b>emissions</b> for the year 2005 and 2025 are generated from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Emissions Inventory (NEI), and two additional sensitivity scenarios are derived from the emissions forecasts. Uncertainties in present and forecast aviation and <b>background</b> <b>emissions</b> are also characterized. The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model is evaluated to quantify its performance in predicting ambient PM 2. 5 and ozone concentrations, and it is used to estimate aviation air quality impacts of aviation. Future-year aviation particulate matter (PM 2. 5) concentrations are found to increase by a factor of 2 and 2. 4 by 2020 and 2030, and are dominated by nitrate and ammonium PM. Aviation 8 -hour daily maximum ozone is seen to grow by a factor of 1. 9 and 2. 2 by 2020 and 2030, with non-homogeneous spatial impacts. Aviation PM 2. 5 varies by +/- 25 % with a +/- 50 % variation of the forecast change in <b>background</b> <b>emissions,</b> while changes in ozone impacts are less symmetric at + 34 %/- 21 %. The RSMv 2 is shown to under-predict future-year aviation nitrate and ammonium PM 2. 5. Finally, the implications of these results on the aviation industry and on aviation policy are discussed. by Akshay Ashok. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|A {{method to}} {{estimate}} background continuum emission in inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) is proposed. The method {{assumes that the}} ICP background continuum emission is mainly due to recombinative radiation in the plasma. The emission intensity at an arbitrary wavelength {{is related to the}} temperature and electron number density of the plasma. Furthermore, the ratio of background continuum emission intensity at two arbitrary plasma excitation conditions is a constant for all wavelengths. Therefore, if there is a change in plasma excitation conditions, the new background continuum emission intensity at an arbitrary wavelength can be calculated from the initial <b>background</b> <b>emission</b> intensity and the emission intensity ratio that can be measured accurately at another convenient wavelength. In this paper, rather than the emission intensity ratio, the ratio of the differences in intensities is used to remove the contribution of dark current in the measured intensity, if any. The ratio is termed 'f-factor'. Firstly, the <b>background</b> <b>emission</b> intensities at two reference plasma excitation conditions are measured. The f-factors of these two <b>background</b> <b>emission</b> intensities are assigned values 0 and 1, respectively. When the plasma excitation condition changes, the f-factor relative to the reference conditions at an arbitrary wavelength can be calculated from the new emission intensity. The <b>background</b> <b>emission</b> intensity at other wavelengths can then be determined from their corresponding emission intensities at the reference conditions and the new f-factor. <b>Background</b> <b>emission</b> intensity of the ICP (λ= 200 - 460 nm) is measured using an ICP spectrometer with a segmented-array imaging detector. The ICP forward power was varied from 800 to 1500 W. In agreement of the model, the f-factors at any wavelengths remain constant at all forward power used. The proposed method was compared to off-peak background correction method. Analyte concentrations were selected to give signal-to-background ratio of ∼ 1. The corrected analyte emission intensities using both background correction methods agree, except for Ca 396. 847 nm, which suffers from spectral overlap from a nearby hydrogen emission line. The ability of the proposed method for background correction of fast changing <b>background</b> <b>emission</b> was demonstrated using direct sample insertion and a direct reading multi-channel spectrometer. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

We employed our hyperspectral microarray scanner coupled with multivariate data analysis algorithms that independently identify and quantitate emissions from all sources to investigate three artifacts that reduce the {{accuracy and reliability}} of microarray data: skew toward the green channel, dye separation, and variable <b>background</b> <b>emissions.</b> Results Here we demonstrate that several common microarray artifacts resulted from the presence of emission sources other than the labeled cDNA that can dramatically alter the accuracy and reliability of the array data. The microarrays utilized {{in this study were}} representative of a wide cross-section of the microarrays currently employed in genomic research. These findings reinforce the need for careful attention to detail to recognize and subsequently eliminate or quantify the presence of extraneous emissions in microarray images. Conclusion Hyperspectral scanning together with multivariate analysis offers a unique and detailed understanding of the sources of microarray emissions after hybridization. This opportunity to simultaneously identify and quantitate contaminant and <b>background</b> <b>emissions</b> in microarrays markedly improves the reliability and accuracy of the data and permits a level of quality control of microarray emissions previously unachievable. Using these tools, we can not only quantify the extent and contribution of extraneous emission sources to the signal, but also determine the consequences of failing to account for them and gain the insight necessary to adjust preparation protocols to prevent such problems from occurring. </p...|$|R
