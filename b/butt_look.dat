60|$|In the meantime, Osborn and Thorn, {{who shared}} his <b>butt,</b> <b>looked</b> about {{while they waited}} for the beaters. The row of turf banks, {{regularly}} spaced, ran back to the Force Crags {{at the head of the}} dale. The red bloom of the ling was fading from the moor, which had begun to get brown. Sunshine and shadow swept across it, and the blue sky was dotted by flying, white-edged clouds. A keen wind swept the high tableland, and the grouse, flying before it, would come over the butts very fast.|$|R
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 School {{had been over}} {{for more than an}} hour, but Annabelle Stevens {{did not want to go}} home. The fact was she had a crush on her AP English teacher, and she wanted to give him a lesson of his own. His <b>butt</b> <b>looked</b> so cute in those new Dockers khakis he wore that day, and she was {{wondering}} if it was just as cute out of the khakis. She knew he wanted her too; he was always staring at her chest during class. 2 ̆...|$|R
60|$|Once again I undid all my work by {{lowering}} the mast into the water. But I miscalculated the point of balance, so that when I heaved {{the top of the}} mast came up instead of the <b>butt.</b> Maud <b>looked</b> despair, but I laughed and said it would do just as well.|$|R
5000|$|Later on, Fez {{develops}} metrosexual habits, appreciating stylish {{clothes and}} at times appearing vain and narcissistic about his looks. He shares an antagonistic relationship with his landlord Fenton (played by Jim Rash) because of a previous dispute over what Fez described as [...] "a pair of pants that made my <b>butt</b> <b>look</b> like an oil painting." [...] Fez shows off his superior dancing skills in numerous episodes.|$|E
6000|$|The {{serenity}} of his self-confidence {{appeared at}} last to make an impression on his antagonist, who lowered his head a little, like some <b>butting</b> animal, and <b>looked</b> at the young man from beneath bushy eyebrows. [...] "Well, I have heard a good deal, since I've been in Boston." ...|$|R
5000|$|Emma Watson's {{performance}} as Nicki received critical acclaim. Richard Roeper called her [...] "comedic gold", while Gleiberman wrote that Watson [...] "proves that {{her willingness to}} take chances is only growing, and that she's an actress serious enough to turn a line like 'Your <b>butt</b> <b>looks</b> awesome!' into something that reveals character." [...] Cath Clarke of Time Out commented positively on Watson, saying, [...] "The real story here isn't the good-girl-goes-bad stunt casting; it's that Watson can act. Against the odds, the Harry Potter star gives a sharp, knowing smart {{performance as}} Nicki." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Emma Watson is sensational as Nicki, an underage club girl and actress wanna-be, {{who lives in a}} universe of Valley Girl narcissism eons away from Hogwarts." [...] Even critics who gave the film overall negative reviews singled Watson out for praise, with Peter Howell from the Toronto Star saying, [...] "The undistinguished young cast of The Bling Ring has just one standout, and that's Emma Watson, who plays one of the most vacuous of the juvenile thieves. We know her best as the brainy Hermione from the Harry Potter movies, and she can obviously do brainless equally well." [...] Joe Neumaier of New York Daily News wrote, [...] "Watson, though, does a great imitation of hollow-eyed gaze; her character is the one who tries to parlay notoriety into success (everyone else can, she figures). The one-time Harry Potter star captures the slack-jawed fan only too well." [...] While not having seen the film then, Alexis Neiers, who inspired Watson's character, stated it looked [...] "inaccurate and trashy" [...] after she saw its first trailer.|$|R
5000|$|The {{documentary}} takes a {{look into}} the trend of black women {{all over the world}} investing in the multibillion dollar business of skin bleaching creams. Duke and Berry also examine how black women are trying to look more Caucasian while white women are trying to look more ethnic. “White women are risking skin cancer and tanning booths twice a week, Botoxing their lips, getting <b>butt</b> lifts to <b>look</b> more ethnic and crinkling up their hair.” ...|$|R
5000|$|DVD {{reviewer}} and Rolling Stone contributor Doug Pratt {{called it}} [...] "an enjoyable action romp". He adds, [...] "the girls kick some serious <b>butt</b> and they <b>look</b> terrific in their hot black jumpsuits. Who can resist?" [...] Film critic Michael Adams said {{the film is}} [...] "so slow in parts I {{think it should be}} called The Dull Squad", but [...] "it picks up at the end". He rated it a solid 37/100. Nonetheless, it {{has become something of a}} cult film for fans of actress Francine York.|$|R
