5|$|I went to New York {{and we were}} in {{the studio}} and came to a break. I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, it was a little <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had a}} goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And I think we showed too much. I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> far.|$|E
5|$|Before Crisis began {{development}} in 2002. The Compilation was first unveiled in 2003 with {{the announcement of}} Advent Children. None of the titles in the series {{up to that point}} were traditional role-playing games like the original. The explanation for this was that traditional RPGs took long production periods and a large staff, which would have made the project stand out a <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> much. One of the other considerations for the team was not to make the titles lightweight as X-2 had been, due to backlash from parts of the fanbase. Conversely, making Final Fantasy X-2 reminded the team that they did not need to stick to completely serious traditional RPGs, enabling the original creation of the Compilation. While Advent Children was the first Compilation title to begin production, it ran into problems during post-production, resulting in the first released title being Before Crisis, despite it being the second title to begin development. Before Crisis was also originally planned for release in North America, but the mobile phones available in North America at the time were not able to handle the game. In addition, the producer Kosei Ito left Square Enix in 2008 and Tabata moved on to other projects, leaving its localization unlikely. Japanese animation studio Madhouse created a commercial to promote Before Crisis. Due to its success and staff feelings that important scenes from VII represented in Advent Children had been needlessly disjointed, the studio was chosen to produce an animated film: this eventually became Last Order. Crisis Core was originally going to be an action game, but became an action RPG, staying within the staff's design strengths while incorporating action elements.|$|E

50|$|In fact, {{because the}} program counter is always word-aligned the lowest two bits are always zero which allowed the {{designers}} to reuse these two bits {{to hold the}} processor's mode <b>bits</b> <b>too.</b> The four modes allowed were USR26, SVC26, IRQ26, FIQ26; contrast this with the 32 possible modes available when the program status was separated from the program counter in more recent ARM architectures.|$|R

25|$|One of {{his initial}} {{projects}} {{was to make}} a song for a twelve-year-old mayor's daughter named Sharon Cuneta. It was a daunting challenge, as Rey initially could not figure out what kind song would be fitting for her; she was too young to be taken seriously to be given a love song, and a <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> old to be given a nursery rhyme.|$|E
25|$|In 1967 a {{significant}} advance was made when Raj Bisaria decided {{to produce and}} direct Jean-Paul Sartre's existential In Camera, Edna St. Vincent Millay’s Aria Da Capo and Ronald Duncan’s translation of 12th century classic Abelard and Heloise in a three-bill presentation, in November, 1967. These were crucial productions as TAW’s audience wavered between shocked admiration and shocked disgust. Four hours of continuous drama was considereda <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> much.|$|E

He proved his expertise on military and foreign affairs during his campaigns against the Persians, Avars and Slavs, and also during peace negotiations with Khosrau II. His administrative reforms reveal him as a farsighted statesman, all the more since they outlasted his death by far and were the basis for the introduction of such themes as military districts.|$|E

25|$|Interestingly, all {{the buzz}} about the Packer affair, which looked such a menace in 78, died down {{within a year}} or so, as the richest man in Australia and the ICC managed to reach an agreement. Yet, the changes {{introduced}} by Packer have not only lasted for a considerable time, in fact, these have continued to produce more changes to the game. Cricket is now fully internationalized, {{and at the same time}} fully commercialized. International stars are now richly paid (and so are the commentators), thanks mainly to the backings and blessings of satellite TV channels. In a sense, Packer was a <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> ahead of his time.|$|E
25|$|The {{maximum age}} of the Unkar Group is also {{established}} by uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating of zircons from an ash bed from the Bass Formation in the basal Unkar Group of 1254 Ma near river Mile 78 (List of Colorado River rapids and features). The dating of detrital zircons from the Bass Formation have yielded dates of about 1200 Ma. These dates suggest that the 1254 Ma age may be a <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> old. However, these zircons likely underwent some lead loss, and, as a result these apparent dates are younger than their actual ages. As a result, the 1254 Ma dates remain the best estimate for the age of initial deposition of the Unkar Group.|$|E
25|$|In a mixed {{review of}} the book in the Wall Street Journal, William Easterly was {{generally}} supportive of the plausibility of the book's thesis but critiqued the book's failure to cite extant statistics-based {{evidence to support the}} validity of the historical case studies. For example, in the book's example about Congo, the stated reason Congo is impoverished is that Congo is close to slave trade shipping points. The approach of this historical case study only offers one data point. Moreover, Easterly also points out the danger of ex-post rationalization that the book only attributes different levels of development to institutions in a way a <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> neat. For example, to explain the fall of Venice, it could be the extractive regime during the time or it could also be the shift from Mediterranean trade to Atlantic trade. The historical case studies approach might be biased.|$|E
50|$|The public {{developments}} of the 1970s broke the near monopoly on high quality cryptography held by government organizations (see S Levy's Crypto for a journalistic account {{of some of the}} policy controversy of the time in the US). For the first time ever, those outside government organizations had access to cryptography not readily breakable by anyone (including governments). Considerable controversy, and conflict, both public and private, began more or less immediately, sometimes called the crypto wars. They have not yet subsided. In many countries, for example, export of cryptography is subject to restrictions. Until 1996 export from the U.S. of cryptography using keys longer than 40 <b>bits</b> (<b>too</b> small to be very secure against a knowledgeable attacker) was sharply limited. As recently as 2004, former FBI Director Louis Freeh, testifying before the 9/11 Commission, called for new laws against public use of encryption.|$|R

"Turn It On Again" [...] {{was built}} out of various {{left-over}} song sections from different projects by each member: The second set of verses was originally conceived by Tony Banks for A Curious Feeling, [...] "We kind of put riff - the bit he didn't use on Smallcreep's Day, curiously enough - with the bit I didn't use on A Curious Feeling, and put these two together. We made it much more rocky, both bits became much more rocky, my bit was a bit more epic, and Mike's bit was a bit slower and a bit more heavy-metal. And then Phil gave it a much more straightforward drum part perhaps neither of us would ever thought that we would want that on that bit ... We put {{on one or two}} other <b>bits,</b> <b>too,</b> that ended up from there".|$|R
50|$|When fitting {{a bit to}} a horse, {{along with}} a bridle, the {{normally}} metal bar of the bit lies in the interdental space between the incisors (or canines, where present) and premolars.

25|$|Dan Byrd as Travis Cobb – Jules' and Bobby's son, who is {{a senior}} in high school at the start of the series, then later attends a local college. He loves both of his parents {{although}} he is frequently embarrassed by both of them. In high school, he dealt with humiliation from his friends and classmates but has made friends at college. He is generally supportive of his mother, but finds her parenting style a <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> smothering. After dealing with his mom's real estate ads around town and his dad's new job as his former high school's grass cutter, his father helps him realize not to worry about what other people think. Spending a lot of time with his parents and their friends, he often flirts with Laurie and is shown to have a crush on her. At the end of season 4 he gets together with Laurie. During season 5 their relationship is shown to be in constant competition with Jules and Grayson's, and he and Laurie have a son named Bobby at the beginning of Season 6. He has a passion for photography and attends art college. Finding few career prospects after graduating college, he starts a mobile wine delivery business.|$|E

30|$|RS(u,ω,k,c)≈ 2 − 27. Yet, {{even though}} {{significantly}} improving upon the iterated Lagrange decoding strategy, an effort of 27 <b>bits</b> is still <b>too</b> costly for a practical implementation.|$|R
50|$|Gamma {{encoding}} {{of images}} {{is used to}} optimize the usage of bits when encoding an image, or bandwidth used to transport an image, {{by taking advantage of}} the non-linear manner in which humans perceive light and color. The human perception of brightness, under common illumination conditions (not pitch black nor blindingly bright), follows an approximate power function (note: no relation to the Gamma function), with greater sensitivity to relative differences between darker tones than between lighter ones, consistent with the Stevens' power law for brightness perception. If images are not gamma-encoded, they allocate <b>too</b> many <b>bits</b> or <b>too</b> much bandwidth to highlights that humans cannot differentiate, and <b>too</b> few <b>bits</b> or <b>too</b> little bandwidth to shadow values that humans are sensitive to and would require more bits/bandwidth to maintain the same visual quality. Gamma encoding of floating-point images is not required (and may be counterproductive), because the floating-point format already provides a piecewise linear approximation of a logarithmic curve.|$|R

A. E. Sparrow from IGN praised how the introduction of Mello, [...] "a man of action", [...] "spiced things up a bit" [...] as he brought [...] "actually" [...] action to the series. Manga News said Mello is [...] "an interesting character" [...] as he is [...] "unpredictable" [...] and also praised the action scenes he brings. As such, they criticized his almost total absence in volume 10 as he is [...] "one of the few to bring some new blood to the series". After Mello's death, Pepirium wrote [...] "Mello deserved more." [...] On the other hand, Mello is [...] "an unhinged character that only offers unpredictability", according to Chris Beveridge of Mania.com. AnimeLand and Manga News presented opposite opinions if whether or not Mello is charismatic character, with the former declaring he does not replace L as he lacks charisma.|$|E
