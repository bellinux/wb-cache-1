5|$|Millar ordered William Strahan {{to print}} {{the work on}} two of his {{printing}} presses to produce a total of 5,000copies for the first run of the work (in comparison, only 3,500copies of The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling were printed {{for the first and}} second edition). This amount proved to <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Millar to sell, although he had to back down from a second printing of 3,000copies immediately after the first edition to ensure that the originals were completely sold. The work had two German translations published in 1752, a Dutch translation in 1756, and a French edition in 1762.|$|E
5|$|Most {{newspaper}} mentions of West Corum do {{not report}} {{what sorts of}} cargo she carried, but a January 1922 Associated Press story in The Christian Science Monitor reveals her cargo for one voyage from Argentina. In what the news item said was the first full load of cargo leaving Buenos Aires in nearly a year, West Corum carried 107,000 animal hides, estimated to <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> 1,000,000 pairs of shoes, along with consignments of wool and linseed. The ship continued calling at Buenos Aires and Santa Fe, Argentina, as late as 1927, but by 1939, West Corum had been laid up in a reserve fleet at New Orleans.|$|E

50|$|The relegation battle {{ended in}} {{disappointment}} for Wolves and Peterborough. The late goal for Crystal Palace against Peterborough meant that a 1-1 draw <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Blackburn, a 2-0 win for Sheffield Wednesday over Middlesbrough <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> {{to secure their}} safety, a 1-0 defeat for Millwall against Derby County <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> them and a 2-2 draw between Huddersfield and Barnsley <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> both teams.

5|$|With the CSBS the {{sighting}} system and calculator {{were the same}} device, which required the bombsight to be fairly large. With this restriction removed, the sight head was much smaller and lighter than the older versions. The resulting sight head was easy to mount on a stabilizer system, adapted from the same Sperry gyroscope as earlier experiments. With the sight head stabilized, the bomb aimer could continue to measure drift even as he indicated turns to the pilot, eliminating the need to correct, re-measure and correct again. The remote console and second operator eliminated {{the need for the}} bomb aimer to look away from the sights, to make adjustments while on the bomb run. As a result of these changes, short aiming periods of a few seconds would <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> an accurate drop.|$|E
5|$|The reader {{progressively}} learns their history. Dobroselova originally {{lived in}} the country, but moved to St. Petersburg (which she hates) when her father lost his job. Her father becomes very violent and her mother severely depressed. Her father dies and they move in with Anna Fyodorovna, a landlady who was previously cruel to them but at least pretends to feel sympathy for their situation. Dobroselova is tutored by a poor student named Pokrovsky, whose drunken father occasionally visits. She eventually {{falls in love with}} Pokrovsky. She struggles to save a measly amount of money to purchase the complete works of Pushkin at the market for his birthday present, then allows his father to give the books to him instead, claiming that just knowing he received the books will <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> her happiness. Pokrovsky falls ill soon after, and his dying wish is to see the sun and the world outside. Dobroselova obliges by opening the blinds to reveal grey clouds and dirty rain. In response Pokrovsky only shakes his head and then passes away. Dobroselova's mother dies shortly afterwards, and Dobroselova is left in the care of Anna for a time, but the abuse becomes too much and she goes to live with Fedora across the street.|$|E

25|$|One classic {{approach}} is to deliver several short balls into the batsman's chest, forcing the batsman onto the back foot to defend with a high bat, and then fire in a fast yorker, aimed {{at the base of}} the stumps. If the batsman is expecting to play a high back foot defensive, the time it takes to shift their weight to play the ball at their feet may just <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the delivery to surprise the batsman and cause him or her to panic, and thus cause the loss of their wicket.|$|E
25|$|Politicians court mafiosi {{to obtain}} votes during elections.

A particularly influential mafioso can bring in thousands of votes for a candidate; such is the respect that a mafioso can command. The Italian Parliament has {{a huge number of}} seats (945, roughly 1 per 64,000 citizens) and a large number of political parties competing for them, meaning that a candidate can win with only a few thousand votes. A mafia clan's support can thus be decisive for their success.|$|E
25|$|Both Michigan and Ohio State {{scored on}} their first {{offensive}} possessions, while the Buckeyes would eventually go up 21–7 midway through the second quarter. The Buckeyes' took a 28–14 lead into halftime, with the Wolverines closing {{the gap in the}} third quarter, scoring on a Mike Hart touchdown run and a Garrett Rivas field goal. Ohio State would extend their lead again following an Antonio Pittman touchdown run, though Michigan would bring the game within four points on another Hart touchdown run. A Troy Smith pass to Brian Robiskie would extend the Buckeyes' lead to 42–31. A late touchdown and two-point conversion would not <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Michigan, as the Buckeyes' would go on to win the game 42–39.|$|E

25|$|Steel, {{carbon fiber}} and glass among others are usually {{considered}} linear materials, while other {{materials such as}} rubber and soils are non-linear. However, {{this is not an}} absolute classification: if very small stresses or strains are applied to a non-linear material, the response will be linear, but if very high stress or strain is applied to a linear material, the linear theory will not <b>be</b> <b>enough.</b> <b>For</b> example, as the linear theory implies reversibility, it would be absurd to use the linear theory to describe the failure of a steel bridge under a high load; although steel is a linear material for most applications, it is not in such a case of catastrophic failure.|$|E

25|$|The Australian, New Zealand, and European Union {{national}} nutrition bodies note {{there have}} been no reports of choline deficiency in the general population. The USA joins these three in not publishing a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), due to lack of consensus evidence. They have, however, published Adequate Intake (AI) values. The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) notes that these figures are based on just one study and that there was little data and the choline made by the body (assuming a dietary intake of zero) may <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> some groups. Australia, New Zealand and Canada use the figures published by the US IOM. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published its own Adequate Intake values, most recently in 2016. For U.S. dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV) based on the AI. For choline, as shown in Reference Daily Intake, 100% of the Daily Value is 550mg.|$|E
25|$|Moving {{into the}} brand new American Airlines Center for the 2001–02 season, the Stars {{got off to a}} slow start to the season, as goaltender Ed Belfour {{struggled}} through one of his worst seasons. Coach Ken Hitchcock was eventually fired, being replaced by Rick Wilson. Despite the coaching change, the Stars continued to play poor hockey. With the prospect of missing the playoffs, the Stars traded 1999 Conn Smythe winner Joe Nieuwendyk and Jamie Langenbrunner to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for Randy McKay and Jason Arnott, who scored the game-winning goal in the 2000 Finals against Dallas. The Stars would eventually go on to post a respectable record of 35–28–13–5. However, it would not <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the playoffs, as they fell four points short of the final eighth spot in the Western Conference. Following the season, coach Rick Wilson would return to assistant coaching duties, as the Stars brought in Dave Tippett as his replacement.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{publicly}} funded health care programs help {{to provide for}} the elderly, disabled, military service families and veterans, children, and the poor, and federal law ensures public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay; however, a system of universal health care has not been implemented nationwide. However, as the OECD has pointed out, the total U.S. public expenditure for this limited population would, in most other OECD countries, <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the government to provide primary health insurance for the entire population. Although the federal Medicare program and the federal-state Medicaid programs possess some monopsonistic purchasing power, the highly fragmented buy side of the U.S. health system is relatively weak by international standards, and in some areas, some suppliers such as large hospital groups have a virtual monopoly on the supply side. In most OECD countries, there is a high degree of public ownership and public finance. The resulting economy of scale in providing health care services appears to enable a much tighter grip on costs. The U.S., as a matter of oft-stated public policy, largely does not regulate prices of services from private providers, assuming the private sector to do it better.|$|E
