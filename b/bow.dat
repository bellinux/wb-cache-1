5|$|<b>Bow</b> Street has {{a strong}} {{connection}} with the law; the <b>Bow</b> Street Runners, an early voluntary police force, was established here by Henry Fielding in 1750, and the Metropolitan Police Service operated a station house from 1832, {{which led to the}} construction of the <b>Bow</b> Street Magistrates' Court.|$|E
5|$|When {{stars are}} moving at {{sufficiently}} high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres can generate <b>bow</b> shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades {{it was assumed}} that the Sun had a <b>bow</b> shock. In 2012, data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA's Voyager probes showed that the Sun's <b>bow</b> shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a subsonic <b>bow</b> wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium. A <b>bow</b> shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).|$|E

50|$|<b>Bows</b> {{are usually}} very simple. Most {{do not have}} sights, and aiming is by {{line-of-sight}} judgment down the arrow. There {{are a couple of}} types of rests including the hook and roller rest. Most <b>bows</b> have little to no let-off and not much draw weight. This differs with what one has available and personal preference. There are two main types of <b>bows.</b> Traditional <b>bows</b> include long <b>bows</b> and recurve <b>bows.</b> In more modern times, compound <b>bows</b> came into use. They use a system of pulleys to help the archer. Modern <b>bows</b> can have as much as 120 pounds (50 kg) draw weight.|$|R
5000|$|Another major {{practice}} of Korean Buddhism is <b>bowing.</b> This practice consists of 3 <b>bows,</b> 108 <b>bows,</b> 1,080 <b>bows</b> or 3,000 <b>bows</b> and aims at ridding the practitioner of greed and attachment. The 108 <b>bows</b> {{is an act}} of atonement for one’s recognized ignorance and cravings, and the 108 kinds of afflictions that arise within them. In this respect, the 108 <b>bows</b> symbolize a fresh start as well and so one empties the illusions one has come to believe to make up one’s “self” and earnestly fills the void with new good intentions.|$|R

5|$|After {{additional}} weather-related delays, on February 26 salvors {{managed to}} float the 440foot(132m) <b>bow</b> section {{and began the}} process of towing it out to sea for disposal. By March 1, the tugboat Sea Victory had towed the <b>bow</b> from the beach and out to sea, initially followed by an oil skimmer vessel, OSRV Oregon Responder. However, another severe storm forced the skimmer back to port, and when the tug was 50miles(65km) off the coast, the tow line broke. The <b>bow</b> section floated for fourteen hours until it ran aground near Waldport, Oregon on March 3, approximately 80miles (130km) {{to the north of}} the original grounding site. On March 8, the <b>bow</b> was again refloated, and by March 11 it was successfully towed 280miles(450km) off the coast by Sea Victory and a second tug, Natoma. At this location, the Pacific Ocean is approximately 10,000feet (3,000m) deep. The <b>bow</b> was sunk by two US Navy ships, the destroyer USS David R. Ray and the submarine USS Bremerton. Four hundred pounds (180kg) of high explosives were attached to the <b>bow</b> and detonated. Sixty-nine rounds of gunfire from David R. Rays 5-inch (127mm) deck guns then punctured the hull. After 40 minutes, the ship was still afloat with darkness and a storm approaching. To expedite the sinking, Bremerton fired a Mark 48 torpedo at the underside of the ship. Within ten minutes, the <b>bow</b> section flooded and sank stern-first, trapping the remaining oil within.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated in the <b>bow</b> and {{exploded}} the forward ammunition magazines. The <b>bow</b> was badly mangled; {{in about half}} an hour, the ship had taken on enough water to sink. As it struck the sea floor, the <b>bow</b> was torn {{from the rest of}} the ship, which rolled over to starboard. As the rest of the hull settled below the waves, a second scuttling charge exploded in the ship's engine rooms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bows</b> can be {{generally}} {{divided into three}} main types: informal, formal, and very formal. Informal <b>bows</b> are made at about a fifteen degree angle or just tilt over one's head to the front, and more formal <b>bows</b> at about thirty degrees. Very formal <b>bows</b> are deeper.|$|R

The woodcarver Grinling Gibbons had premises on <b>Bow</b> Street between 1678 and 1721, while the physician John Radcliffe stayed on the street in the 1680s.

Constellation sailed over to gain L'Insurgentes starboard side, and the two ships settled into exchanging broadsides.

Constellation again sailed ahead of L'Insurgente, reversing course to cross her <b>bow</b> and rake her a second time. Attempts by Barreaut's crew to repair L'Insurgentes rigging were fruitless. Once more Constellation maneuvered to reach L'Insurgentes leeward side. As Constellation crossed the frigate's <b>bow</b> again to rake her a third time, the French ship struck, having sustained too much damage. The engagement had lasted 74 minutes.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Differences in the {{magnitude}} of <b>bowing</b> between races are well-known characteristics of the femur. Asian races have an increased magnitude of femoral <b>bowing</b> {{but most of the}} orthopedic implants designed for the femur do not match this exaggerated <b>bowing.</b> We calculated the sagittal and coronal femoral <b>bowing</b> in the Japanese population at different levels of the femur and addressed its surgical significance. 				 					Material and methods: We calculated the sagittal and coronal <b>bowing</b> of 132 Japanese femora using CT scan of the femur. A mathematical calculation of the radius of curvature at proximal, middle, and distal regions of the femur was used to determine the degree of femoral <b>bowing.</b> 				 					Results: Mean sagittal <b>bowing</b> of the femur was 581, 188, and 161  mm for the proximal, middle, and distal thirds of the femur and mean lateral <b>bowing</b> was 528, 5092, and 876  mm, respectively. Mean sagittal and coronal <b>bowing</b> for the whole femur was 175 and 2640  mm, respectively. No correlation was found between age, gender, length of femur, and the degree of <b>bowing.</b> 				 					Conclusion: Our study reveals that femoral <b>bowing</b> in the Japanese population is 175  mm in the sagittal plane and 2640  mm in the coronal plane; these values are greater than the femoral <b>bowing</b> in other ethnic groups studied in the literature. 				This may result in varying degrees of mismatch between the western-manufactured femoral intramedullary implants and the Japanese femur. We recommend that orthopedic surgeons to accurately perform preoperative evaluation of the femoral <b>bowing</b> to avoid potential malalignment, rotation, and abnormal stresses between the femur and implant...|$|R

In July 1902 four trains an hour ran from <b>Bow</b> Road (2 to 3 from East Ham) to Ealing or Wimbledon and two trains an hour from New Cross served Hammersmith or Richmond.
