5|$|A few {{thousand}} {{of the first}} circulation strikes, {{as well as a}} handful of proof coins, came from a prototype die with smaller letters in the motto than all other 1864 pieces.

5|$|The Battle of Bardia {{brought to}} the fore the {{simmering}} hostility between regular officers and reservists. Frank Berryman, the 6th Division's General Staff Officer (Grade 1), and Alan Vasey, the Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General (DA), were eager for Robertson to do well and show that Staff Corps officers could make good commanders, and if that could <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> expense of an old-style reservist like Stanley Savige, so much the better. They pushed for Robertson's 19th Infantry Brigade, then in reserve, to be committed when the attack by Savige's 17th Infantry Brigade slowed down. The abrupt manner in which this was done generated antipathy between Robertson and Savige.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated at the competition's outcome, Leech on June 11, 1891 {{instructed}} Barber {{to prepare}} {{designs for the}} half dollar, quarter, and dime. As the Morgan dollar was then being heavily struck, the Mint director decided to leave that design unaltered for the time being. For the obverse of the new coins, Leech suggested a depiction of Liberty similar to that on the French coins of the period; he was content that the current reverses be continued. Leech had previously suggested to Barber that he engage outside help if the work was to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Mint; the chief engraver replied that {{he was aware of}} no one who could be of help in the preparation of new designs. Leech had spoken with Saint-Gaudens on the same subject; the sculptor stated that only four men in the world were capable of executing high-quality coin designs; three lived in France and he was the fourth.|$|E

The tutor should also allow for discussions and debates to be had. Through this dialogue, it was meant to create an environment in which students would teach themselves. They would be able to realize their mistakes and make corrections to them as necessary.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of a {{subdural}} hematoma {{depends on}} its size and rate of growth. Some small subdural hematomas can be managed by careful monitoring until the body heals itself. Other small subdural hematomas can be managed by inserting a temporary small catheter through a hole drilled through the skull and sucking out the hematoma; this procedure can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bedside. Large or symptomatic hematomas require a craniotomy, the surgical opening of the skull. A surgeon then opens the dura, removes the blood clot with suction or irrigation, and identifies and controls sites of bleeding. Postoperative complications include increased intracranial pressure, brain edema, new or recurrent bleeding, infection, and seizure. The injured vessels must be repaired.|$|E

25|$|Biosafety-level-4 {{laboratories}} {{are used}} for diagnostic work and research on easily transmitted pathogens which can cause fatal disease. These include a number of viruses known to cause viral hemorrhagic fever such as Marburg virus, Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Other pathogens handled at BSL-4 include Hendra virus, Nipah virus, and some Flaviviruses. Additionally, poorly characterized pathogens which appear closely related to dangerous pathogens are often handled at this level until sufficient data are obtained either to confirm continued work at this level, or {{to work with them}} at a lower level. This level is also used for work with Variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, though this work can only <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> World Health Organization approved facilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, U.S.A., as well as the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology in Koltsovo, Russia.|$|E

500|$|The {{size of the}} {{pneumothorax}} (i.e. {{the volume}} of air in the pleural space) can be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy by measuring {{the distance between the}} chest wall and the lung. This is relevant to treatment, as smaller pneumothoraces may be managed differently. An air rim of 2cm means that the pneumothorax occupies about 50% of the hemithorax. British professional guidelines have traditionally stated that the measurement should be performed {{at the level of the}} hilum (where blood vessels and airways enter the lung) with 2cm as the cutoff, while American guidelines state that the measurement should <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> apex (top) of the lung with 3cm differentiating between a [...] "small" [...] and a [...] "large" [...] pneumothorax. The latter method may overestimate the size of a pneumothorax if it is located mainly at the apex, which is a common occurrence. The various methods correlate poorly, but are the best easily available ways of estimating pneumothorax size. CT scanning (see below) can provide a more accurate determination of the size of the pneumothorax, but its routine use in this setting is not recommended.|$|E

500|$|On 29 May 1900, Tiger was reactivated, {{and she was}} {{assigned}} as the flagship of the II Division the following day. She served in this role for three months during the summer training period, {{before returning to the}} reserve fleet. In 1901, the navy decided to add bilge keels to the ship to reduce her tendency to roll in heavy seas. In addition, a [...] dynamo, a steam control system, and electric lights were also installed. She participated in the summer training exercises in 1902 and 1903, before returning to reserve status on 15 September 1903. In late 1903, the navy began to consider what would be done with Tiger, now 15 years old, for the remainder of her career. The navy considered four options in a meeting on 19 February 1904: to keep the ship armed with her original gun batter, to disarm her, to replace them with new 40-cal. versions, or replace them with 7cm 45-cal. guns. Ultimately, the Marinesektion rejected all four proposals, since the ship's boilers were in poor condition by that point. Instead, they decided to convert the ship into an admiralty yacht, since she had little combat value by that time anyway. Additionally, the current yacht, Pelikan, was to be converted into a depot ship for the torpedo training school. The plan was prepared in June, and the work was to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Pola Naval Arsenal. The conversion work was done in 19051906 and she was renamed Lacroma on 29 January 1906. Her armament reduced to six 47mm QF guns and the sponsons for her main battery were removed.|$|E
