5|$|Extreme {{weather is}} rare <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> {{has been known}} to {{experience}} tornados – the most recent being in July 2005 in the south of the city, damaging homes and businesses in the area.|$|E
5|$|Skopje {{has several}} minor railway {{stations}} <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> {{does not have}} its own railway network and they are only serviced by intercity or international lines. On the railway linking the main station to Belgrade and Thessaloniki are Dračevo and Dolno Lisiče stations, and on the railway to Kičevo are Skopje-North, Gjorče Petrov and Saraj stations. Several other stations are freight-only.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Skopje was in ruins. Most of the {{official}} buildings were restored or rebuilt, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> experienced new plague and cholera epidemics and many inhabitants emigrated. The Ottoman Turkish Empire as a whole entered in recession and political decline. Many rebellions and pillages occurred in Macedonia during the 18th century, either led by Turkish outlaws, Janissaries or Hajduks. An estimation conducted by French officers around 1836 revealed that at that time Skopje only had around 10,000 inhabitants. It was largely overwhelmed by two towns of the present-day Republic of Macedonia: Bitola (40,000) and Štip (15–20,000).|$|E
50|$|The {{town was}} {{returned}} to Poland soon afterwards, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> growth lost its momentum.|$|R
50|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that the Nagpur police was established during the 1861 police re-organization, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> policing history goes back far before that.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Paris" [...] {{is derived}} from its early inhabitants, the Celtic Parisii tribe <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> name {{is not related to}} the Paris of Greek mythology.|$|R
5|$|After the war, {{increased}} wartime {{manufacturing and}} industrial growth {{ushered in a}} new era of economic prosperity, and Indianapolis's population increased from 8,000 in 1850 to 45,000 at the end of 1864. A real-estate boom led to the establishment of new residential suburbs, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> retained its slums. Indianapolis also experienced improvements to its public services, such as health care, utilities, street railways, and public schools. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. Construction for the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument began in 1888, in the center of downtown Indianapolis, after decades of discussion. The city's iconic monument was dedicated on May 15, 1902.|$|E
5|$|Angered {{with the}} {{passivity}} of Buenos Aires during the Luso-Brazilian {{invasion of the}} Banda Oriental, Francisco Ramírez from Entre Ríos and Estanislao López from Santa Fe joined forces against the city. Saavedra fled to Montevideo, fearing that Buenos Aires would be obliterated if defeated. Ramírez and López won the battle of Cepeda, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was not destroyed, so Saavedra returned. He retired in 1822, and lived {{with his family in}} the countryside. He offered his services {{at the beginning of the}} War of Brazil, despite being 65 years old, but Balcarce declined the offer. He wrote his memoirs, Memoria autógrafa, in 1828.|$|E
5|$|Around 1830, Providence had {{manufacturing}} {{industries in}} metals, machinery, textiles, jewelry, and silverware. Manufacturing has declined since, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> {{is still one}} of the largest centers for jewelry and silverware design and manufacturing. Services also make up a large portion of the city's economy, in particular education, healthcare, and finance. Providence also is the site of a sectional center facility (SCF), a regional hub for the U.S. Postal Service. It is the capital of Rhode Island, so the city's economy additionally consists of government services.|$|E
50|$|The land Vogt {{office of}} the Alsace, {{consisting}} of <b>the</b> ten imperial <b>cities</b> of <b>the</b> Décapole, was ceded to the king of France in 1648, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> remained part of the Holy Roman Empire. However, <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> were soon thereafter annexed by France.|$|R
5000|$|Gilbert had {{apparently}} added [...] "Quid Aere Perennius", the Horace quote on his own, {{perhaps as a}} joke. It now serves as <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> motto. Gilbert had also designed a flag for Waterbury, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> aldermen rejected it {{in favor of a}} design featuring <b>the</b> <b>city</b> seal.|$|R
50|$|Oakdale lies entirely {{within the}} North St. Paul-Maplewood-Oakdale school district, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> {{students}} are {{split into two}} high schools. Tartan High School is located within <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> boundaries, and serves the southern half of Oakdale. <b>The</b> <b>city's</b> northern residents are served by North High School in North St. Paul.|$|R
5|$|Besides {{their main}} campus in Broadmoor, the {{congregation}} also operates Beth Israel Cemetery, {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Located at 19th Street and 5th Avenue, it was originally outside of Meridian's city limits and {{was intended to be}} a rural cemetery, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> has since expanded and annexed the area containing the cemetery. The cemetery contains generations of German and Alsatian immigrants, as well as many big names of the largely mercantile Jewish community of {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries. Beth Israel Cemetery is the only remaining built memorial for many of Meridian's early Jews since the era of the 1879 and 1906 temple buildings, neither of which still stands.|$|E
5|$|Bristol sent three {{ships to}} the Royal Navy fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and also {{supplied}} two levies {{of men to}} the defending land forces. Despite appeals to the Privy Council no reimbursement was made for these supplies. The corporation also had to repair the walls and gates of the city. The castle had fallen into disuse in the late Tudor era, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> authorities {{had no control over}} royal property and the precincts became a refuge for lawbreakers.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 18th century BC, Ebla had become a vassal of Yamhad, an Amorite kingdom centered in Aleppo. Written records are not available for this period, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was still a vassal during Yarim-Lim III of Yamhad's reign. One of the known rulers of Ebla during this period was Immeya, who received gifts from the Egyptian Pharaoh Hotepibre, indicating the continuing wide connections and importance of Ebla. The city was mentioned in tablets from the Yamhadite vassal city of Alalakh in modern-day Turkey; an Eblaite princess married a son of King Ammitaqum of Alalakh, who belonged to a branch of the royal Yamhadite dynasty.|$|E
50|$|The 1906 San Francisco {{earthquake}} essentially destroyed <b>the</b> entire downtown, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> population did not greatly suffer. However, {{after that}} period the population growth of Santa Rosa, {{as with most}} of the area, was very slow.|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea for}} a winter festival to {{celebrate}} Manitoba's Francophonie was first proposed by Georges Forest. He became the first official Voyageur. Voyageurs are people who promote the festival [...] in 1967. The proposal was put forth to <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of St. Boniface, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> offer was insufficient.|$|R
50|$|The {{project was}} planned for 2008 through to 2010, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> {{problems}} with <b>the</b> {{construction of the}} new Maria Skłodowska-Curie Bridge caused investment delays {{because of the lack}} of alternative routes during the reconstruction of the bridge.|$|R
5|$|During the Middle Ages, {{settlements}} {{had been}} established predominantly {{along the lines of}} the existing roads, and the principal villages were Stepney, Whitechapel and Bow. Settlements along the river began at this time to service the needs of shipping on the Thames, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> of London retained its right to actually land the goods. The riverside became more active in Tudor times, as the Royal Navy was expanded and international trading developed and downstream, a major fishing port developed at Barking to provide fish to the City. These and other factors meant that industries relating to construction, repair, and victualling of naval and merchant ships flourished in the area.|$|E
5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5|$|In 1066 William the Conqueror {{defeated}} the English army {{at the battle}} of Hastings and Norman forces advanced west into Worcestershire. To reinforce their occupation, the Normans built a motte and bailey castle {{on the south side of}} the city, taking advantage of the shape of the existing burh walls. The remaining burh walls continued to be used into the Norman period, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> had already spread beyond them, reducing their effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|Abashiri {{is known}} as the site of the Abashiri Prison, a Meiji-era {{facility}} used for the incarceration of political prisoners. The old prison {{has been turned into a}} museum, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> new maximum-security prison is still in use.|$|R
50|$|A {{citizen of}} Lausanne with a {{bachelor}} in law, Jean Bagnyon began his law career as a conscindic (syndic) in Lausanne, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> fiscal difficulties forced him to move to Geneva. In 1481, he was chosen by Lausanne to represent <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> proposal to unite with its lower city.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the later}} 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> {{like most other}} {{industrial}} inner-ring suburbs, has fallen into economic decline. In December 1986, the Wayne County Circuit Court issued a court order appointing a receiver for <b>the</b> bankrupt <b>city.</b> <b>The</b> receivership would last until August 1990, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> finances were monitored by the state for another ten years.|$|R
5|$|In 1968, {{the vast}} Prudhoe Bay Oil Field was {{discovered}} in Alaska's North Slope. Fairbanks became a supply point for exploitation of the oil field and for construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which caused a boom unseen since {{the first years of}} Fairbanks' founding and helped the town recover from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood. Fairbanks became a government center in the late 1960s with the establishment of the Fairbanks North Star Borough, which took Fairbanks as its borough seat. A drop in oil prices during the 1980s caused a recession in the Fairbanks area, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> gradually recovered as oil prices climbed during the 1990s. Tourism also became an important factor in Fairbanks' economy, and the growth of the tourism industry and the city continues even as oil production declines.|$|E
5|$|In March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces {{won their}} first major victory at Taierzhuang {{but then the}} city of Xuzhou was taken by Japanese in May. In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by {{flooding}} the Yellow River; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at Wuhan, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was taken by October. Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve; instead the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing and continued the war.|$|E
5|$|Many Croatian {{cities were}} {{attacked}} by artillery, missiles, and aircraft bombs by RSK or JNA forces from RSK or Serb-controlled areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Montenegro and Serbia. The most shelled cities were Vukovar, Slavonski Brod (from the mountain of Vučjak), and Županja (for more than 1,000 days), Vinkovci, Osijek, Nova Gradiška, Novska, Daruvar, Pakrac, Šibenik, Sisak, Dubrovnik, Zadar, Gospić, Karlovac, Biograd na moru, Slavonski Šamac, Ogulin, Duga Resa, Otočac, Ilok, Beli Manastir, Lučko, Zagreb, and others Slavonski Brod was never directly attacked by tanks or infantry, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> and its surrounding villages were hit by more than 11,600 artillery shells and 130 aircraft bombs in 1991 and 1992.|$|E
5000|$|In circa 1300, Arab {{geographer}} al-Dimashqi {{noted that}} Latakia had {{no running water}} and that trees were scarce, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> port was [...] "a wonderful harbor... full of large ships". In 1332, the Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta visited Latakia in his journeys.|$|R
50|$|Japanese Americans did {{not live}} in Chinatown, <b>but</b> {{throughout}} <b>the</b> <b>city.</b>|$|R
50|$|Flanders {{had some}} of <b>the</b> richest <b>cities</b> of that time, like Bruges, Ghent, Ypres, Lille and Douai. These cities tried to keep their {{independence}} from the Count of Flanders and from <b>the</b> rural aristocracy. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> were themselves divided between the rich patricians and the urban tradesmen, united in guilds.|$|R
5|$|Oslo had unsuccessfully bid to {{host the}} 1936 Winter Olympics, losing to Germany, which had hosted the 1936 Summer Olympics. At that time, the nation that hosted the Summer Olympics also hosted the Winter Olympics. After the 1936 Games, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to award the Winter and Summer Games to {{different}} countries, but the Games were suspended during World War II. London hosted the first post-war Games, the 1948 Summer Olympics, and recommended Oslo as the host city for the 1948 Winter Games, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> council declined. Instead, the 1948 Winter Olympics were held in St. Moritz, Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Peterborough City Council is {{the local}} {{authority}} for Peterborough in the East of England. It is a unitary authority, having the powers of a non-metropolitan county and district council combined. The City was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1874; from 1888, it fell within {{the jurisdiction of the}} Soke of Peterborough county council and from 1965, Huntingdon and Peterborough county council. In 1974, it was replaced by a wholly new non-metropolitan district, broadly corresponding to the Soke, in the new enlarged Cambridgeshire. In 1998, Peterborough became independent of Cambridgeshire as a unitary authority, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> continues to form part of that county for ceremonial purposes as defined by the Lieutenancies Act 1997.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the first}} {{settlers}} lived in caves dug {{out of the river}} bank, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> grew with construction of homes, churches, and wharves. The new landowners did not share Penn's vision of a non-congested city. Most people bought land along the Delaware River instead of spreading westward towards the Schuylkill. The lots they bought were subdivided and resold with smaller streets constructed between them. Before 1704, few people lived west of Fourth Street.|$|E
50|$|Saint-Gaudens {{served as}} head of the Chicago exposition's {{sculpture}} committee. His initial plan had been to place Diana atop <b>the</b> Women's Pavilion, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> Women's Christian Temperance Union protested and insisted that the controversial nude figure be clothed. Instead, it was placed atop the Agricultural Building.|$|R
5000|$|Compton's crime had by {{no means}} ended. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>City’s</b> murder rate had {{been cut in half}} and other statistics, had leveled off. “Compton's {{reputation}} is worse than actual experience,” contended Cocheé, “although there’s still enough crime in this city that citizens are justified in their feelings.” ...|$|R
50|$|California Assemblyman Chris Holden, D-Pasadena had in February of 2017 {{sponsored}} {{a bill to}} block the closing and completion of the nb/sb I-710 to the eb/wb I-210 gap, in which <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> of Monterey Park and Alhambra had for many years bore {{the brunt of the}} I-710 detoured street traffic, and hoped for <b>the</b> completed extension, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> of South Pasadena and Pasadena remained staunchly opposed.|$|R
