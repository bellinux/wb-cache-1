5|$|Since Koht {{lived in}} Lysaker, Bærum Municipality wanted to honor him <b>by</b> <b>naming</b> a street after him. When {{the street was}} named in 1967, Koht was still controversial. The street was {{therefore}} named Professor Kohts vei ("Professor Koht's Road") to emphasise his academic, rather than his political career.|$|E

5|$|Because of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike cut {{the season}} short and {{cancelled}} the post-season, the BBWAA writers effectively created {{a de facto}} mythical national championship (similar to college football) <b>by</b> <b>naming</b> managers of the unofficial league champions (lead the leagues in winning percentage) (Buck Showalter and Felipe Alou) as Managers of the Year. Two franchises, the New York Mets and the Milwaukee Brewers, {{have not had a}} manager win the award.|$|E

The city of Norwich recognised Gunn's charity work and his long association with the city's football club <b>by</b> <b>naming</b> him Sheriff for 2002.

5|$|Since {{the first}} {{installment}} was released in 1995, the Tales series has grown to include the main entries and multiple spin-offs that derive multiple gameplay and narrative elements from the main entries. Except when indicated <b>by</b> <b>naming,</b> the main Tales entries are separate from each other apart from gameplay mechanics and themes. While Tales titles are often ported to new consoles after their original release, these remakes are rarely localized. The 2006 Nintendo DS game Tales of the Tempest was originally seen as a main entry in the series, but in 2007 was classified as a spin-off, possibly due to poor reception of that particular title.|$|E
5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity of viruses <b>by</b> <b>naming</b> and grouping them {{on the basis of}} similarities. In 1962, André Lwoff, Robert Horne, and Paul Tournier were the first to develop a means of virus classification, based on the Linnaean hierarchical system. This system bases classification on phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Viruses were grouped according to their shared properties (not those of their hosts) and the type of nucleic acid forming their genomes. Later the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses was formed. However, viruses are not classified on the basis of phylum or class, as their small genome size and high rate of mutation makes it difficult to determine their ancestry beyond order. As such, the Baltimore classification is used to supplement the more traditional hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|From 1945 to 1947, {{eighteen}} human {{test subjects}} were injected with plutonium without informed consent. The tests {{were used to}} create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of plutonium in the body {{in order to develop}} safety standards for working with plutonium. Ebb Cade was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of Plutonium on 10 April 1945 at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This experiment was under the supervision of Harold Hodge. Other experiments directed by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the Manhattan Project continued into the 1970s. The Plutonium Files chronicles the lives of the subjects of the secret program <b>by</b> <b>naming</b> each person involved and discussing the ethical and medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors. The episode is now considered to be a serious breach of medical ethics and of the Hippocratic Oath.|$|E

5|$|In 1092 {{and again}} in 1093 the dispute with Canterbury resurfaced, when Thomas complained about what he felt were {{infringements}} of York's rights. The first of these occasions was over the dedication of Remigius de Fécamp's new cathedral at Lincoln and the second concerned the consecration of Anselm as Archbishop of Canterbury. Thomas refused to consecrate Anselm if the latter {{was referred to as}} Primate of England. The impasse was finally resolved <b>by</b> <b>naming</b> Anselm the Metropolitan of Canterbury. The medieval chronicler Eadmer, Anselm's biographer and a Canterbury partisan, says that Anselm was consecrated as the primate. Hugh the Chanter, {{who was a member of}} the York community, stated that the metropolitan title was used. Modern historical opinion is divided, with Frank Barlow, author of The English Church 1066–1154 inclined towards the primatial title, but with Richard Southern, in his biography of Anselm, leaning towards the metropolitan title. The whole affair is probably subject to much duplicity and dishonesty, with both sides presenting biased accounts.|$|E
5|$|In late 1950, USAF Chief Scientist Louis Ridenour {{initiated}} Project Charles at MIT {{to study}} problems of air defense. The study determined that Valley's methods {{were the best}} option. In May 1951, the project was reformed as Project Lincoln to investigate unusual reconnaissance methods; this group met at Beacon Hill, Boston, and {{became known as the}} Beacon Hill Study Group. Saville expanded the group <b>by</b> <b>naming</b> 15 men to the project, all experts in their fields, including Edwin H. Land, James Gilbert Baker, Edward Mills Purcell, Richard Scott Perkin and USAF Colonel Richard S. Leghorn. The project led to the establishment of Lincoln Laboratory, a research and development project of the Defense Department.|$|E
5|$|In the November 1980 general elections, Governor Romero Barceló was re-elected by {{a margin}} of 3,503 votes (one of the closest in Puerto Rico history), though his party lost control of the state {{legislature}} to the main opposition party, the PPD. This loss was attributed by The New York Times to the surrounding controversy regarding the investigations at the time. Other news organizations, such as Time, attributed the loss to Gov. Romero Barcelo's stance on the island's political status. The Legislature quickly started new inquiries and hearings into the Cerro Maravilla incident. The Senate, then presided by Miguel Hernández Agosto, spearheaded the investigations <b>by</b> <b>naming</b> former Assistant District Attorney Hector Rivera Cruz to investigate.|$|E
