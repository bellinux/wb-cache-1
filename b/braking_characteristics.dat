50|$|Cab {{signalling}} is {{a system}} that communicates signalling information into the train cab (driving position).

In modern systems, a train protection system is usually overlaid on top of the cab signalling system and will automatically apply the brakes and bring the train to a stand if the driver fails to control the speed of the train in accordance with the system demands.

30|$|The EN 14531 (first draft 2003) {{describes}} the fundamental algorithms and calculations {{for the design}} of brake equipment for railway vehicles. The procedure provides the calculation of various aspects related to the performance: stopping or slowing distances, dissipated energy, force calculations, and immobilization braking. For the purposes of this work, the Part 6 of the regulation: “Application to high-speed trains” is of interest. The general algorithm to calculate braking distances is described in the regulation: the input data consist of train and <b>brake</b> <b>characteristics,</b> and the method to estimate the deceleration as a combination of different braking forces acting on the train is suggested {{as a function of the}} initial speed [1]. Moreover, the criteria for the technical and operational compatibility between the infrastructures and the rolling stock are defined in L. 245 / 402 technical specification for interoperability (TSI) published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in 2002. The essential requirements for trans-European high-speed rail systems are related to safety, reliability, availability, health, environmental protection, and technical compatibility. Notably, the brake system requirements for high-speed rail systems are established; i.e., the minimum braking performance is defined as the minimum deceleration and evaluated as a function of speed [2]. On the other hand, the European norm UIC 544 - 1 (4 th edition, October 2004) defines the method for computation of the braking power through the braked mass and determination of the deceleration [3].|$|R

In this work, the arising need for an innovative control system for small scale wind turbines particularly suited to a low wind speed urban environment has been addressed. This work focuses on the stand-alone application of a vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) cross-flow prototype with the prospect of being able to grid-tie the system without any major modification to the control system. This constraint has led to the inclusion of a magnetic brake with various advantages over conventional braking methods which are addressed in the literature review of this thesis. Furthermore, the latter revealed lack of computerized models for the setup described, therefore it has been decided in this work to focus on software-based controller development utilizing models which have been validated by various experiments. In the first development stage, a novel test bench prototype has been developed for prior evaluation of the <b>brake</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The prototype has been utilized for deriving a model dedicated to the low-speed region and for developing an efficient design strategy to be able to customize control systems for future small scale wind turbines.
