Original sin is present among most of the developing economies, especially in periods with high inflation rate and currency depreciation.

5000|$|The heavy <b>borrowing</b> <b>abroad</b> by Irish banks {{reflected}} the enormous {{increase in their}} lending into the Irish property market, a lending area which since 1996 seemed {{to be able to}} provide an endless flow of profitable lending opportunities as the Irish public relentlessly bought and sold property. [...] The total stock of mortgage loans in Ireland exploded from €16 billion {{in the first quarter of}} 2003 to a peak of €106 billion by the third quarter of 2008, about 60 percent of Ireland's GDP for that year. [...] This, in turn, led to a massive increase in the price of Irish property assets. The freezing-up of the world's interbank market during the financial crisis of 2007-2008 caused two problems for Irish banks. Firstly, with no new money available to borrow, withdrawal of deposits caused a liquidity problem. In other words, there was no cash available to honour withdrawal requests. A liquidity problem on its own is usually manageable through Central Bank funding. However, the second problem was solvency and this was much more serious. The lack of new money meant no new loans which meant no new property deals. No new property purchases both exposed the fragile cash-flows of developers and highlighted the stratospheric valuations of property. With the value of most of their assets (loans) declining in line with the property market, the liabilities (deposits) of the six Irish domestic banks were now considerably greater than their assets. Insolvency loomed and Irish banks would need major cash injections (recapitalisation) to stay open.|$|E

This has implications for current global imbalances in reserves and feasible adjustment paths. ...|$|E

40|$|In a {{standard}} two-sector neoclassical model with distortions, capital mobility can render the steady state indeterminate, {{in the sense}} that there exist infinitely many convergent paths. In the closed economy with no international capital mobility, the utility function must be linear or close to it for indeterminacy to occur, while in the open economy the shape of the utility function makes no difference. The reason is that in the no mobility case changes in aggregate investment must be matched by changes in aggregate consumption, while in the case of full capital mobility they can simply be financed by <b>borrowing</b> <b>abroad.</b> The paper provides some solid theoretical underpinnings to the concerns that de-regulating the capital account may be destabilizing. ...|$|E

The reason is that the absorption into the new DM-zone of an area with initially scant productive assets amounts to a permanent fall in per capita wealth of the new Germany relative to the old one. An alternative interpretation is that the real depreciation is required to compensate a worsened net asset position (as Germany <b>borrows</b> <b>abroad</b> to finance capital accumulation).

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the type of {{production}} technology, specifically whether it exhibits decreasing returns to scale in capital, {{is an important factor in}} evaluating the welfare gain from liberalizing financial markets, and hence the optimal financial structure for a country. As financial markets become completely liberalized, countries gain from a better capital allocation as a result of improved risk sharing, but the less wealthy country can no longer profit from <b>borrowing</b> <b>abroad</b> at a lower rate and reinvesting at home in the technology with a higher expected rate of return. With decreasing (rather than constant) returns to capital, the gain from risk sharing is more likely to dominate the loss of the difference between the borrowing rate abroad and the decreasing (rather than constant) reinvestment rate at home. Our analysis suggests that complete liberalization is likely to be optimal for less wealthy countries unless their labor endowment is large, their mean productivity is large, or initial holdings by foreigners are small, as is currently the case in China. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 on the {{financial}} decisions made by firms. We review the theory and empirical predictions of prior literature for corporate debt policy, for dividend and equity repurchase payouts to shareholders, and for the choice of organizational form. We then compare the predictions to post- 1986 experience. The change in debt/value ratios has been substantially smaller than expected. Dividend payouts increased as predicted, but stock repurchases increased even more rapidly which was unexpected and is difficult to understand. Based on very scant data, it appears that some activities have shuffled among organizational forms; in particular, loss activities may have been moved into corporate form where they are deducted at a higher tax rate, while gain activities may have shifted towards noncorporate form, to be taxed at the lower personal rates. In addition, several interesting new issues are raised. One concerns previously neglected implications for the effective tax on retained earnings that follow from optimal trading strategies when long- and short-term capital gains are taxed at different rates. Also, new interest allocation rules for multinational corporations provide a substantial incentive for many firms to shift their <b>borrowing</b> <b>abroad.</b> ...|$|E

We give a closed-form solution to a linear version of our model. The economy, in that case, follows a two-stage pattern of growth. During the first stage, the debt grows more rapidly than the economy. During the second stage, both the debt and the economy grow at the same rate, and more slowly than in the first stage. During this second stage, the total interest falling due on the debt is never entirely repaid; only an amount proportional to the difference of the rate of interest and the rate of growth of the economy is repaid each period. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the question of}} capital control (inflow) and its varied effect on interest rates and real-side economy. The moral hazard problem causes interest rates to increase {{as a function of}} external debt. Decreased capital inflow (external debt) can reduce moral hazard and outweigh the effect of costly capital transactions, with capital control decreasing interest rates and increasing output. This result runs counter to other theoretical works on capital control. The policy implication is that a government can generate national gains from capital inflow control by prohibiting new external debt (<b>borrowing</b> from <b>abroad).</b> With old debt retired and no new <b>borrowing</b> from <b>abroad,</b> external debt is reduced.
