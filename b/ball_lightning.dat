5|$|The {{formations}} {{under the}} command of V SS Mountain Corps varied during Phlep's command. In July 1944, it consisted of the 118th Jäger Division and 369th (Croatian) Infantry Division in addition to the 7th SS and 13th SS divisions. Throughout Phlep's command, the corps was under the overall control of 2nd Panzer Army and conducted anti-Partisan operations throughout the NDH and Montenegro. These operations included Operations Kugelblitz (<b>ball</b> <b>lightning)</b> and Schneesturm (blizzard), which were part of a major offensive in eastern Bosnia in December 1943, but they were only a limited success. Phleps had met personally with Hitler to discuss the planning for Operation Kugelblitz.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{they learn}} {{that the members of}} the Sanders-Hardiman {{expedition}} are falling into comas, with fragments of a shattered crystal ball found near each victim. Concerned, Tintin, Haddock, and their friend Professor Calculus visit Calculus's old friend Professor Hercules Tarragon, the only expedition member yet to be affected. Professor Tarragon is under police guard, and he shows his visitors the mummified body of Inca king Rascar Capac, which the expedition brought back with them from Peru. A lightning storm strikes the house and sends <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> down the chimney and onto the mummy—which evaporates. Worried, Tarragon states that this reflects the culmination of Capac's prophecy, which declares that punishment will descend upon those who desecrate his tomb. Spending the stormy night at Tarragon's house, Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus are each awoken by a dream involving Capac's mummy. They find Tarragon comatose in his bed, with the accompanying crystal shards nearby; the attacker had bypassed the guards by climbing in via the chimney. The next day, Calculus is walking on the grounds of Tarragon's house when he discovers one of the mummy's bracelets, which he places on himself.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, Tanaka and Yanagida {{point out}} that the people of Edo period shared great {{interests}} in paranormal things such as poltergeists, will-o'-the-wisps, <b>ball</b> <b>lightnings</b> and monsters, so it would not be surprising to find stories of exotic boats like the Utsuro-bune.|$|R
5000|$|Nieminen's {{research}} and theories in physics are unusual. The {{basis of his}} work is the theory of [...] "ether vortices". In principle, the theory claims {{that the universe is}} filled with ether, and as the ends of the ether come close to each other vortices appear. The center of a vortex is an elementary particle. Nieminen claims his theories can explain gravity, quantum phenomena, <b>ball</b> <b>lightnings</b> and the creation of the world.|$|R
25|$|The soliton {{model of}} a <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> was further developed. It was {{suggested}} that a <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> is based on spherically symmetric nonlinear oscillations of charged particles in plasma – the analogue of a spatial Langmuir soliton. These oscillations were described in both classical and quantum approaches. It {{was found that the}} most intense plasma oscillations occur in the central regions of a <b>ball</b> <b>lightning.</b> It is suggested that bound states of radially oscillating charged particles with oppositely oriented spins – the analogue of Cooper pairs – can appear inside a <b>ball</b> <b>lightning.</b> This phenomenon, in its turn, can lead to a superconducting phase in a <b>ball</b> <b>lightning.</b> The idea of the superconductivity in a <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> was considered earlier. The possibility of the existence of a <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> with a composite core was also discussed in this model.|$|E
25|$|The Handel Maser-Soliton {{theory of}} <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> hypothesizes {{that the energy}} source {{generating}} the <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> is a large (several cubic kilometers) atmospheric maser. The <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> appears as a plasma caviton at the antinodal plane of the microwave radiation from the maser.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{have long}} {{attempted}} to produce <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> in laboratory experiments.

5000|$|On 30 April 1877, a <b>ball</b> of <b>lightning</b> {{entered the}} Golden Temple at Amritsar, India, and exited through a side door. Several people {{observed}} the ball, and the incident is {{inscribed on the}} front wall of Darshani Deodhi.|$|R
2500|$|On 6 August 1944, a <b>ball</b> of <b>lightning</b> {{went through}} a closed window in Uppsala, Sweden, leaving a {{circular}} hole about [...] in diameter. The incident was witnessed by residents in the area, and was recorded by a lightning strike tracking system on the Division for Electricity and Lightning Research at Uppsala University.|$|R
25|$|The {{motion of}} such balls {{is far from}} being very rapid– they have even been {{observed}} occasionally to pause in their course, but they are not the less destructive for all that. A <b>ball</b> of <b>lightning</b> which entered the church of Stralsund, on exploding, projected a number of balls which exploded in their turn like shells.|$|R
25|$|Until the 1960s, most {{scientists}} treated reports of <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> skeptically, despite numerous accounts {{from around the}} world. Laboratory experiments can produce effects that are visually similar to reports of <b>ball</b> <b>lightning,</b> but how these relate to the natural phenomenon remains unclear.|$|E
25|$|Oleg Meshcheryakov {{suggests}} that <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> {{is made of}} composite nano or submicrometre particles—each particle constituting a battery. A surface discharge shorts these batteries, causing a current that forms the ball. His model is described as an aerosol model that explains all the observable properties and processes of <b>ball</b> <b>lightning.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In {{his book}} Thunder and Lightning, {{translated}} into English in 1875, French science writer Wilfrid de Fonvielle wrote {{that there had}} been about 150 reports of globular lightning:Globular lightning seems to be particularly attracted to metals; thus it will seek the railings of balconies, or else water or gas pipes etc, It has no peculiar tint of its own but will appear of any colour {{as the case may be}} ... at Coethen in the Duchy of Anhalt it appeared green. M. Colon, Vice-President of the Geological Society of Paris, saw a <b>ball</b> of <b>lightning</b> descend slowly from the sky along the bark of a poplar tree; as soon as it touched the earth it bounced up again, and disappeared without exploding. On 10th of September 1845 a <b>ball</b> of <b>lightning</b> entered the kitchen of a house in the village of Salagnac in the valley of Correze. This ball rolled across without doing any harm to two women and a young man who were here; but on getting into an adjoining stable it exploded and killed a pig which happened to be shut up there, and which, knowing nothing about the wonders of thunder and lightning, dared to smell it in the most rude and unbecoming manner.The motion of such balls is far from being very rapid - they have even been observed occasionally to pause in their course, but they are not the less destructive for all that.

25|$|The <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> has {{the same}} {{rotational}} axis as the rotating cylinder. As the vortex has a much smaller vector of energy compared to the overall energy of the reactant sonic shock wave, its vector is likely fractional to the overall reaction. The vortex, during contraction, gives {{the majority of its}} energy to form the <b>ball</b> <b>lightning,</b> achieving nominal energy loss.|$|E
25|$|In some observations, the <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> {{appeared}} to have an extremely high energy concentration but this phenomenon hasn't been adequately verified. The present theory concerns only the low energy lightning ball form, with centripetal forces and surface tension. The visibility of the <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> {{can be associated with}} electroluminescence, {{a direct result of the}} triboelectric effect from materials within the area of the reaction. Static discharge from the cylindrical stage imply the existence of contact electrification within the object. The direction of the discharges indicate the cylinder's rotation, and resulting rotational axis of the <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> in accordance to the law of laminar flow. If the ball came from the channel, it would have rotated in the opposite direction.|$|E

25|$|Cooray and Cooray (2008) {{stated that}} the {{features}} of hallucinations experienced by patients having epileptic seizures in the occipital lobe {{are similar to the}} observed features of <b>ball</b> <b>lightning.</b> The study also showed that the rapidly changing magnetic field of a close lightning flash is strong enough to excite the neurons in the brain. This strengthens the possibility of lightning-induced seizure in the occipital lobe of a person close to a lightning strike, establishing the connection between epileptic hallucination mimicking <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> and thunderstorms.|$|E

25|$|Physicist Domokos Tar {{suggested}} the following theory for <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> formation {{based on his}} <b>ball</b> <b>lightning</b> observation. Lightning strikes perpendicular to the ground, and thunder follows immediately at supersonic speed {{in the form of}} shock waves that form an invisible aerodynamic turbulence ring horizontal to the ground. Around the ring, over and under pressure systems rotate the vortex around a circular axis in the cross section of the torus. At the same time, the ring expands concentrically parallel to the ground at low speed.|$|E

50|$|A mast {{radiator}} {{may need}} various electrical connections {{other than the}} transmitter feed line. Such connections include static drain chokes (which drain off static charges caused by wind, clouds, etc.), spark-gap <b>balls</b> for <b>lightning</b> protection, power supplies for aircraft warning lamps, and coaxial feeders for ancillary antennas mounted on the mast. A variety of techniques are used to 'isolate' these connections from the high RF voltage on the mast, such as chokes, parallel tuned circuits and coupling loops, on a base-fed mast. On a shunt-fed mast, where the base is grounded, such measures are unnecessary.|$|R
