25|$|According to the USGS, {{there is}} a broad {{consensus}} {{that the possibility of}} major earthquakes in the New Madrid Seismic Zone remains a concern, and that the GPS data do not provide a compelling case for lessening perceived earthquake hazards in the region. One concern is that the small earthquakes that still happen are not diminishing over time, as would <b>be</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were aftershocks of the 1811–1812 events; another is that the 4,500-year archaeological record of large earthquakes in the region is more significant than ten years of direct strain measurement. The USGS issued a fact sheet in 2009 stating the estimate of a 7–10% chance of a New Madrid earthquake of magnitude comparable to one of the 1811–1812 quakes within the next 50 years, and a 25–40% chance of a magnitude 6.0 earthquake in the same time frame.|$|E
25|$|With {{the switch}} to CBS, WTTV became the de facto home station of the Colts, due to CBS' {{contract}} to carry a schedule mainly made up of American Football Conference games and Thursday Night Football, and a deal between Tribune Broadcasting and the team making the station and WXIN exclusive broadcast partners. This means both stations will air Colts preseason games, team programming and coach's show beginning {{in the summer of}} 2015; advertising within Lucas Oil Stadium is also included in the deal. Additionally, both stations will carry the Super Bowl for two out of every three years starting in 2016, with WTTV carrying CBS coverage of Super Bowl 50 in 2016 and WXIN Fox's coverage of Super Bowl LI in 2017. Between CBS' AFC rights and Fox's NFC rights, the only time the Colts would not play on a Tribune station would <b>be</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were scheduled for an NBC Sunday Night Football telecast, which would air on WTHR, or ESPN Monday Night Football, which has traditionally aired on WRTV. The first Colts game to air on WTTV as a CBS affiliate was the team's first-round playoff victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on January 4, and it carried two more games in the 2014 NFL season before the Colts lost to the Patriots in the AFC Championship on January 18, 2015.|$|E

500|$|Jackson's biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli {{promoted}} {{the theory that}} [...] "Billie Jean" [...] was derived from a real life experience the singer faced in 1981. The Magic & The Madness documents how a young woman wrote Jackson a letter, which informed the singer {{that he was the}} father of one of her twins. Jackson, who regularly received letters of this kind, had never met the woman in question and ignored it. The woman, however, continued to send Jackson more letters, which stated that she loved him and wanted to be with him. She wrote of how happy they would <b>be</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> raised the child together. She pondered how Jackson could ignore his own flesh and blood.

500|$|Pausch based {{the lecture}} on the generic [...] "Last Lecture" [...] given by some professors, and {{on the idea of}} imagining what one would say and what one would want their legacy to <b>be</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> could only have one last chance to share their {{knowledge}} with the world. Carnegie Mellon had previously had a lecture series titled the [...] "Last Lecture", but had renamed the series to [...] "Journeys", and had staff talk about their professional experiences. Pausch was offered the lecture around the time when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and had just received the news that he only had a few months left to live after his unsuccessful treatment for the tumors. Pausch nearly cancelled the lecture due to the terminal cancer, but discussed the issue with his wife and decided to take the one final chance to share his thoughts with the world. Pausch compared it to the final scene of The Natural, in which Roy Hobbs (the main character) overcomes injury and old age to hit one final home run.|$|E

Pappus ben Judah found Rabbi Akiva publicly gathering people to study Torah and asked Akiva whether he did not fear the government. Akiva replied with a parable: A fox was once walking alongside of a river, and he saw fish swimming {{from one place to}} another. The fox asked the fish from what they fled. The fish replied that they fled from the nets cast by men. The fox invited the fish to come up onto the dry land, so that they could live together as the fox’s ancestors had lived with the fish’s ancestors. The fish replied that for an animal described as the cleverest of animals, the fox was rather foolish.

Soon afterwards, the Romans arrested and imprisoned Rabbi Akiva, and the Romans arrested Pappus ben Judah and imprisoned him next to Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Akiva asked Pappus who had brought him there. Pappus replied that Rabbi Akiva was happy that he had been seized for occupying himself with the Torah. Pappus regretted that he had been seized for occupying himself with idle things. When the Romans took Rabbi Akiva out for execution, it was the hour for the recital of the Shema, and while they combed his flesh with iron combs, he was accepting upon himself the kingship of Heaven by reciting [...] ("Here, O Israel [...] [...] [...] ," [...] Shema Yisrael [...] [...] [...]). His disciples asked him whether his devotion extended even to that point. He replied that all his days, he had been troubled by [...] "with all your soul," [...] which he interpreted to mean, [...] "even if God takes one's soul." [...] Rabbi Akiva questioned when he would have the opportunity to fulfill this. Now that he had the opportunity, he asked his disciples, should he not fulfill it? He prolonged the word [...] "One" [...] (ehad) in [...] until he expired while saying it. A Heavenly voice went forth and proclaimed: Happy are you, Akiva, that your soul has departed with the word [...] "One"! The ministering angels asked God: Such devotion to Torah, and such a reward? The angels argued that he should have received the reward of [...] "from them that die by Your hand, O Lord."
