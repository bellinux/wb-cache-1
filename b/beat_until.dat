500|$|In August 1967, {{just prior}} to {{recording}} sessions for the WCPAEB's third Reprise album, Shaun Harris took a hiatus from the band. His departure was partly due to his disillusionment with the group, primarily with the WCPAEB's lack of success, and it served as a waiting period while his brother, Danny, was being treated for depression. He formed the California Spectrum with Danny, Lloyd, and Jimmy Greenspoon. The group toured the Midwest with Markley's state-of-the-art light show, and released two singles in its brief recording career, [...] "Sassafras" [...] (the same version featured on Volume One) and a cover of the Left Banke's [...] "She May Call You Up Tonight", none of which were met with much attention. When Harris returned to the WCPAEB in 1968, he touted a completely different line-up, and promoted the California Spectrum with his column in the teen zine Tiger <b>Beat</b> <b>until</b> the group disbanded sometime in early 1969.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a review}} for Down Beat Brad Faberman states [...] "Playing steady {{time can be}} confining, but the {{opposite}} extreme—abandoning rhythm altogether—is just as much a jail... The free-improvising trio has chosen to operate somewhere in between, bending <b>beats</b> <b>until</b> they’re vague and uncountable but still deeply felt." ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Beat</b> <b>Until</b> Stiff is {{the second}} release, and first {{full-length}} album, by Hullabaloo. It was released in 1989 on Toxic Shock. For <b>Beat</b> <b>Until</b> Stiff, TQ had taken over as full-time lead singer for the band (though Sluggo sings on the tune [...] "Taskmaster" [...] and hidden track [...] "Sea of Trash"), and his vocals that range from a growl to a scream begin to characterize the bands sound. The bands punk rock sensibilities {{are still in the}} forefront with fast, thrashy songs like [...] "The Lickyerbutt Song" [...] and [...] "This is My Rifle", and with subjects like [...] "Retardo Porn" [...] and [...] "Suicidal Maniac." [...] But with the songs [...] "Beat Until Stiff" [...] and [...] "Gotta Go" [...] some slower tempos and heavier guitars are introduced, giving the album a proto-grunge feel. The trademark trumpet and saxophone solos are still present throughout. Kris Fell, in the Boston Phoenix said that the [...] "lyrics on <b>Beat</b> <b>Until</b> Stiff are blunt, almost photographic representation of the grotesque..." [...] This album features a guitar solo by Mr. Horribly Charred Infant of the Happy Flowers.|$|E

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the drum duet Thompson and Collins begin drumming either side of two barstools. This idea evolved from when Collins was interviewed during the Way We Walk tour about how the duets are constructed. He said: [...] "A lot of the patterns evolve through the tour, so the duet {{at the end of the}} tour is much longer than the one at {{the beginning}}. But initially me and Chester sit either side of a chair and drum out <b>beats</b> <b>until</b> something sticks." ...|$|R

5000|$|Griffin's second album, Flaming Red, {{released}} in 1998, was {{a departure from}} the acoustic sound of Living with Ghosts, with a mix of mellow songs and high-tempo rock and roll songs.

Another song from the album, [...] "Tony", is also featured on the charity benefit album Live in the X Lounge.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Beat</b> <b>Until</b> Stiffs {{new songs}} were {{recorded}} and mixed at the Fort Apache South studio by Paul Q. Kolderie.
