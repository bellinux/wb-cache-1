5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, choral {{associations}} became common in Maryland, and Baltimore, <b>buoyed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> immigration of numerous Germans. These groups were formed {{for the purpose}} of instruction in choral music, eventually performing oratorios. The popularity of these choral associations helped to garner support among the local population for putting music education in the city's public schools. The Baltimore Oratorio Society, the Liederkranz and the Germania Männerchor were {{the most important of these}} associations, and their traditions were maintained into the 20th century by organizations like the Bach Choir, Choral Arts Society, Concert Artists of Baltimore, Handel Society and the Baltimore Symphony Chorus.|$|E

As Virginia Tech {{recovered}} from the worst school shooting in American history, football served {{as a way to}} help the university community emotionally heal. The opening game of the season, on September 1, 2007, was against East Carolina University and featured numerous remembrance ceremonies and commemorations. <b>Buoyed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> emotion of the day, the Hokies earned a 177 victory. Their next game would not be as easy. One week later, Virginia Tech traveled to Baton Rouge, Louisiana to face the No.2 Louisiana State University Tigers. The Tigers were widely regarded in pre-season polls as favorites to play in the National Championship Game and overwhelmed the Hokies in front of a home crowd, 487.|$|E

5|$|In 1956 {{he started}} his third All-Star Game, but was charged with the loss despite {{allowing}} only one run in three innings. <b>Buoyed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arrival of rookie shortstop Luis Aparicio, who sparked the team in leading the league in stolen bases, the White Sox enjoyed a two-month offensive surge from June 4 to August 3 in which they averaged eight runs in Pierce's 13 starts; he won 11 of the games, losing only those immediately {{before and after the}} All-Star break, the latter being a 2–1 loss to Ford and the Yankees. He became the first White Sox pitcher since 1941 to win 20 games, was second in the AL with a career-high 192 strikeouts (a team record for left-handers until Gary Peters had 205 in 1964), and was named AL Pitcher of the Year by The Sporting News, outpolling Ford (who had edged him in a close 1955 vote) by a margin of 117 to 52; he also finished fifth in voting for the AL Most Valuable Player Award. In 1957 Pierce became the first White Sox pitcher since Red Faber (1920–1922) to earn 20 victories in consecutive seasons; he tied Jim Bunning for the league lead, and bested him in voting for AL Pitcher of the Year. He had six consecutive complete game victories from May 16 to June 8 in which his total ERA was 0.64, with two 1–0 victories in ten innings including his sixth career two-hitter on June 4 against the Red Sox; the White Sox scored just nine total runs over the last five games in that stretch. Despite the presence of such popular players as Miñoso, Aparicio and second baseman Nellie Fox, Pierce was chosen as the player most popular with White Sox fans in a 1957 spring training poll of sportswriters. A separate poll of managers, coaches, writers and broadcasters named him Chicago's best fielding pitcher, best pitcher at holding runners to first base, and best pitcher for crucial games, as well as the team's most nervous player on the field.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{technique}} {{to determine the}} phase velocity of long-wavelength shoaling waves is investigated. Operationally, the technique consists of three steps. First, using the Hilbert transform of a time series, the phase of the analytic signal is determined. Second, the correlations of the phases of analytic signals between two points in space are calculated and an average time of travel of the wave fronts is obtained. Third, if directional spectra are available or can be determined from time series of large array of buoys, the angular information {{can be used to}} determine the true time of travel. The phase velocity is obtained <b>by</b> dividing <b>the</b> distance between <b>buoys</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> correlation time. Using the Hilbert transform approach, there is no explicit assumption of the relation between frequency and wavenumber of waves in the wave field, indicating that it may be applicable to arbitrary wave fields, both linear and nonlinear. Limitations of the approach are discussed. N 00173 - 95 -WR- 00266 NAVenezuelan Navy autho...|$|R
