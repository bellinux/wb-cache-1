50|$|Species are {{selected}} for their acceptance of varying {{climate and soil}} conditions, relative insusceptibility to pests and diseases, ease of propagation and speed of vegetative growth. To combat pests such as brassy and <b>blue</b> <b>willow</b> <b>beetles,</b> {{as well as the}} fungal pathogen Melampsora (a rust), planting a carefully selected mix of varieties is recommended. The management of the plantations highly affects the productivity and its success.|$|R
40|$|Aggregation {{behavior}} of herbivorous insects is mediated {{by a wide}} range of biotic and abiotic factors. It has been suggested that aggregation {{behavior of}} the <b>blue</b> <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> Phratora vulgatissima is mediated by both host plant odor and by odor released by the beetles. Previous studies show that the beetles respond to plant odors according to their prior host plant experiences. Here, we analyzed the effect of the host plant species on odor released and perceived by adult P. Â vulgatissima. The major difference between the odor of beetles feeding on salicin-rich and salicin-poor host plants was the presence of salicylaldehyde in the odor of the former, where both males and females released this compound. Electrophysiological studies showed that the intensity of responses to single components of odor released by beetles was sex specific and dependent on the host plant species with which the beetles were fed. Finally, behavioral studies revealed that males feeding on salicin-rich willows were attracted by salicylaldehyde, whereas females did not respond behaviorally to this compound, despite showin...|$|R
40|$|Gregarious organisms need {{to handle}} the {{trade-off}} between increasing food competition and {{the positive effects of}} group living, and this is particularly important for ovipositing females. We hypothesized that insect females consider how many conspecifics previously visited a host plant. In a no-choice assay, we show that the gregarious <b>blue</b> <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> (Phratora vulgatissima) laid the most eggs and the largest clutches on plants where a sequence of few individual females was released, compared to plants where one or many different females were repeatedly released. Therefore, this species is more sensitive to the indirectly perceived number of conspecifics than the directly perceived number of eggs on a plant. We further hypothesized that females adjust their own intra-plant egg clutch distribution to that of conspecifics and discovered a new behavioral component, i. e., the modulation of distances between clutches. Females adjusted these distances in ways indicating the use of spatial memory, because the largest distance increases were observed on plants with their own clutches, compared to plants with clutches from conspecifics. However, adjustment of aggregation level and distance between clutches occurred only on a suitable, and not on an unsuitable, Salix genotype. We conclude that both behaviors should reduce competition between sibling and non-sibling larvae...|$|R
50|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>willow</b> <b>beetle</b> {{is found}} on aspen and various willow (Salix) species in fens, carrs and on river banks, but also often in willow short {{rotation}} coppice in agricultural landscapes. It often aggregates on host plants. On Salix cinerea, it prefers and is more common on female than male trees despite higher egg predation exerted by Anthocoris nemorum on the former. It is univoltine in Sweden but can produce multiple generations per year {{in other parts of}} its distribution range. Proliferation of larvae and egg production varies with vegetation. It overwinters under lichens on trees and under tree bark. Predators of <b>blue</b> <b>willow</b> <b>beetle</b> eggs are the common flowerbug (Anthocoris nemorum) and Orthotylus marginalis, and the adult is a vessel for larval development for the parasitoid wasp Perilitus brevicollis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>willow</b> <b>beetle</b> (Phratora vulgatissima), {{formerly}} Phyllodecta vulgatissima, is a herbivourous beetle of {{the family}} Chrysomelidae. It is black with metallic shine in nuances individually varying from a more common blue to a rarer bronze. It is distinguished from P. vitellinae by the latter more commonly displaying bronze nuances. The larvae undergo three instar stages from hatching to pupation.|$|E
40|$|Plant sex {{effects on}} herbivores are well studied, but {{little is known}} about these effects on predators and predator-herbivore dynamics. Here we take a {{holistic}} approach to study, simultaneously, plant sex effects on herbivore and predator preference and performance, as well as population densities and predation pressure in the field. For dioecious Salix cinerea (grey willow) we found that male plants represented higher host plant quality than females for an omnivorous predator (Anthocoris nemorum, common flower bug), while host plant quality for its herbivorous prey (Phratora vulgatissima, <b>blue</b> <b>willow</b> <b>beetle)</b> was not sex-biased. The herbivore strongly preferred the host plant sex (female) that was suboptimal for the predator, which in turn followed its prey to female plants, leading to plant-sex-biased predation. These results provide new insight into the far-reaching effects of plant sex on insect communities, and open up novel opportunities for improving biocontrol of the herbivore in Salix short rotation coppice...|$|E

40|$|Group {{formation}} reduces individual predation risk {{when the}} proportion of prey taken per predator encounter declines faster than the increase in group encounter rate (a ack-abatement). Despite a ack-abatement being {{an important component of}} group formation ecology, several key aspects have not been empirically studied, that is, interactions with the hunting mode of the predator and how these relationships are modi ed by local habitat quality. In 79 cage trials, we examined individual egg predation risk in di erent-sized egg clutches from the <b>blue</b> <b>willow</b> <b>beetle</b> Phratora vulgatissima for two predators with di erent hunting modes (consumption of full group [Orthotylus marginalis] vs. part group [Anthocoris nemorum]). Because these predators also take nutrients from plant sap, we could examine how the quality of alternative food sources (high- vs. low-quality host plant sap) in uenced a ack-abatement pa erns in the presence of di erent hunting strategies. For the O. marginalis predator, individual egg predation risk was largely independent of group size. For A. nemorum, egg predation risk clearly declined with increasing group size. However, approximately one-third of the grouping bene t was lost to an increase in group detectability. There were clear di erences in a ack-abatement pa erns between plants with high- vs. low-quality sap. When O. marginalis was the predator, there was no clear change in a ack-abatement in relation to host plant quality. However, for A. nemorum there was a clear reduction in overall predation risk and a stronger a ack-abatement pa ern with increasing group size when plant sap quality increased. This implies that the relative bene ts of prey grouping behavior for any species might show diurnal or seasonal changes as other aspects of resource/habitat quality change for the focal predator. Modulation of a ack-abatement by bo om-up e ects such as plant-based food resources is yet to be incorporated into general theory, despite the ubiquity of omnivorous predators and with omnivory being important for shaping food webs, ecosystem functions, and in biological control. Thus, ongoing re nement of a ack- abatement theory by focusing on bo om-up vs. top-down processes could have signi cant impacts on many important contemporary elds of study...|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} the potential {{effects of climate}} change on the sub-alpine <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle,</b> the cold tolerance strategy and mechanisms involved in cold tolerance were investigated for all life stages. Microhabitat choice and microclimate temperatures within each microhabitat were related to median lethal temperature for each life stage. Summer active and quiescent adults are freeze tolerant, eggs and pupae are freeze avoidant and all larval stages are chill susceptible. Quiescent adults accumulated the highest concentration of glycerol (~ 24 mM) and haemolymph osmolality (875 mOsm). Haemolymph from pupae had angular crystals suggestive of antifreeze agent activity, but this was absent in the haemolymph of other life stages. Quiescent adults must move to a thermally buffered microhabitat in the soil to survive the winter in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. Low temperatures beyond the limits of the cold tolerance of the <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> occur often at the mid-willow, but the quiescent adults are protected from these cold exposures in the soil beneath the willow. Overall, the <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> uses both behavioural avoidance strategies and physiological mechanisms to survive cold exposures in its habitat...|$|R
