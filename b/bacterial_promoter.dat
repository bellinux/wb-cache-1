This difference, not yet widely exploited in bioinformatics, looks promising {{for the development of}} relevant computational tools to search for strong <b>promoters</b> in <b>bacterial</b> genomes. Results We describe a new triad pattern algorithm that predicts strong promoter candidates in annotated bacterial genomes by matching specific patterns for the group I σ 70 factors of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. It detects promoter-specific motifs by consecutively matching three patterns, consisting of an UP-element, required for interaction with the α subunit, and then optimally-separated patterns of - 35 and - 10 boxes, required for interaction with the σ 70 subunit of RNA polymerase. Analysis of 43 bacterial genomes revealed that the frequency of candidate sequences depends on the A+T content of the DNA under examination. The accuracy of in silico prediction was experimentally validated for the genome of a hyperthermophilic bacterium, Thermotoga maritima, by applying a cell-free expression assay using the predicted strong promoters. In this organism, the strong promoters govern genes for translation, energy metabolism, transport, cell movement, and other as-yet unidentified functions. Conclusion The triad pattern algorithm developed for predicting strong <b>bacterial</b> <b>promoters</b> is well suited for analyzing bacterial genomes with an A+T content of less than 62 %.

40|$|Abstract Background Transcription is {{the first}} step in {{cellular}} information processing. It is regulated by cis -acting elements such as promoters and operators in the DNA, and trans -acting elements such as transcription factors and sigma factors. Identification of cis -acting regulatory elements on a genomic scale requires computational analysis. Results We have used oligonucleotide profiling to predict regulatory regions in a bacterial genome. The method has been applied to the Escherichia coli K 12 genome and the results analyzed. The information content of the putative regulatory oligonucleotides so predicted is validated through intra-genomic analyses, correlations with experimental data and inter-genome comparisons. Based on the results we have proposed a model for the <b>bacterial</b> <b>promoter.</b> The results show that the method is capable of identifying, in the E. coli genome, cis -acting elements such as TATAAT (sigma 70 binding site), CCCTAT (1 base relative of sigma 32 binding site), CTATNN (LexA binding site), AGGA-containing hexanucleotides (Shine Dalgarno consensus) and CTAG-containing hexanucleotides (core binding sites for Trp and Met repressors). Conclusion The method adopted is simple yet effective in predicting upstream regulatory elements in bacteria. It does not need any prior experimental data except the sequence itself. This method should be applicable to most known genomes. Profiling, as applied to the E. coli genome, picks up known cis -acting and regulatory elements. Based on the profile results, we propose a model for the <b>bacterial</b> <b>promoter</b> that is extensible even to eukaryotes. The model is that the core promoter lies within a plateau of bent AT-rich DNA. This bent DNA acts as a homing segment for the sigma factor to recognize the promoter. The model thus suggests an important role for local landscapes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene regulation. </p...|$|E

40|$|Upstream A-tracts stimulate {{transcription}} from {{a variety}} of <b>bacterial</b> <b>promoters,</b> and this has been widely attributed to direct effects of the intrinsic curvature of A-tract-containing DNA. In this work we report experiments that suggest a different mechanism for the effects of upstream A-tracts on transcription. The similarity of A-tract-containing sequences to the adenine- and thymine-rich upstream recognition elements (UP elements) found in some <b>bacterial</b> <b>promoters</b> suggested that A-tracts might increase promoter activity by interacting with the α subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP). We found that an A-tract-containing sequence placed upstream of the Escherichia coli lac or rrnB P 1 promoters stimulated transcription both in vivo and in vitro, and that this stimulation required the C-terminal (DNA-binding) domain of the RNAP α subunit. The A-tract sequence was protected by wild-type RNAP but not by α-mutant RNAPs in footprints. The effect of the A-tracts on transcription was not as great as that of the most active UP elements, consistent with the degree of similarity of the A-tract sequence to the UP element consensus. A-tracts functioned best when positioned close to the − 35 hexamer rather than one helical turn farther upstream, similar to the positioning optimal for UP element function. We conclude that A-tracts function as UP elements, stimulating transcription by providing binding site(s) for the RNAP αCTD, and we suggest that these interactions could contribute to the previously described wrapping of promoter DNA around RNAP...|$|R

40|$|We have {{examined}} the influence of negative supercoiling on the DNA structure of a <b>bacterial</b> <b>promoter</b> (tyrT from Escherichia coli), the transcriptional activity of which is strongly enhanced by torsional stress in vitro.

These regions occur with high frequency (1 per 30 - 50 bp) and are normally centered on a TpA doublet. The major positions of cleavage are located in and around the - 10 sequence TATGATG, the unwinding of which is a prerequisite for gene expression. An apparently trivial change in the - 10 sequence from TATGATG to TATGAAG reduces both transcriptional activity and S 1 nuclease sensitivity at least 10 -fold. Thus the nuclease sensitivity of the promoter correlates strongly with its biological function; and both of these phenomena correlate with certain sequence-dependent structural properties of the DNA...|$|E
