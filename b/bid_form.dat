40|$|We {{consider}} a pool type electricity market in which generators bid prices {{in a sealed}} <b>bid</b> <b>form</b> and are dispatched by an independent system operator (ISO). In our model, demand is inelastic and the ISO allocates production to minimize the system costs while considering the transmission constraints. In a departure from received literature, the model incorporates explicit description of the network details. The analysis shows that losses along transmission lines render the market imperfectly competitive. Indeed, competition among generators is qualitatively similar to the interaction among firms in amonopolistic competition setting. Alower bound formarket prices is derived and it is shown that the costumers’ cost of oligopolistic pricing is strictly positive. At a methodological level, we generalize standard oligopoly theory tools. This work was partially supported by ICM Complex Engineering Systems...|$|E

In the last decade, award fee contracts have gained popularity on operations service contracts within the federal government contracting arena. Recently, award fees have been added to fixed-price construction contracts. The objective of award fees in construction contracts is to positively motivate and reward the contractor to perform beyond the standard which is expected and to emphasize areas of management concern. A study of Fixed-Price Award Fee (FPAF) contracts completed by the General Services Administration (GSA) in the Northwest/Arctic Region from 1996 through 2000 was conducted to analyze construction award fee performance and compare them to other fixed-price contracts. The contracts in this study ranged in price from $ 1. 3 million to $ 13. 7 million. Our research found that FPAF cost growth was significantly less than other GSA fixed-price construction and repair contracts during the same period. There were no claims filed on the FPAF contracts over the five-year study period. An analysis was also completed on change order rates, change order types, award fee evaluation procedures and benefits. The results of this study demonstrate that the FPAF contracts have performed well and have enticed Contractors to improve their focus on the owner's core concerns. It also indicates that the use of the evaluated <b>bid</b> <b>form</b> and the performance award fee evaluation provide several advantages to the GSA owner...|$|E

Method A sample of 1288 patients (538 AN and 750 BN) were assessed through a structured diagnostic interview, the Eating Disorders Inventory and Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire. Cognition of body image distortion, weight checking, fear of weight gain and body dissatisfaction were assessed by specific questions during the interview. Results Various aspects of <b>BID</b> <b>formed</b> similar, but not identical, dimensions in AN and BN. In both groups, anticipatory anxiety and interoceptive awareness were significantly and independently associated with body image distortion, whereas ineffectiveness was associated with weight checking. Discussion Body image disturbance is a multidimensional characteristic linked to psychological features, such as anticipatory anxiety, ineffectiveness and interoceptive awareness. These findings have scientific and treatment implications, and should be considered by clinicians in adopting successful treatment strategies...|$|R
