5|$|Armed {{with the}} {{knowledge}} gained from their prisoners, Alvarado sent 40 men to cover the exit from the cave and launched another assault along the ravine from the west, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with soldiers bearing muskets, each with a companion sheltering him from arrows and stones with a shield. This tactic allowed the Spanish {{to break through the}} pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city, and were hunted down by the victorious conquistadors and their allies. Those who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the exit from the cave, the survivors were captured and brought <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> The siege had lasted more than a month and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 10 April, leading {{elements}} of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. Bad roads and freezing rain slowed the Austrian advance in the first week, but the opposing Bavarian forces gradually retreated. The Austrian attack occurred about a week before Napoleon's anticipations, and in his absence Berthier's role became all the more critical. Berthier (whose fortè was staff work) {{proved to be an}} insufficient field commander, a characteristic made worse by the fact that several messages from Paris were being delayed and misinterpreted when they finally arrived at headquarters. Whereas Napoleon had written to Berthier that an Austrian attack before 15 April should be met by a general French concentration around Donauwörth and Augsburg, Berthier focused on a sentence that called for Davout to station his III Corps around Regensburg and ordered the Iron Marshal to move <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> despite massive Austrian pressure.|$|E

Gyrion was fired and Jacz Transportation was one of 13 truck companies suspended from the Hired Truck program. About 35% of the 70 firms in the program were suspended or referred to the city's Inspector General. The program was overhauled in 2004, and phased out in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Nabis drafted 10,000 {{citizens}} {{into his}} army and hired 3,000 additional mercenaries. Nabis' Cretan allies, who profited from the naval bases on his territory, dispatched 1,000 specially selected warriors {{to augment the}} 1,000 they had already sent to Sparta's aid. Nabis, fearing that the Roman approach might encourage his subjects to revolt, decided to terrorize them by ordering the execution of eighty prominent citizens. Flamininus left his base and descended upon Sellasia; while the Romans were making camp, Nabis' auxiliaries attacked them. The sudden surprise attack briefly threw the allies {{into a state of}} confusion, but the Spartans retreated <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> when the main body of legionary cohorts arrived. As the Romans marched past Sparta on their way to Mount Menelaus, Nabis' mercenaries attacked the allies' rear. Appius Claudius, commander of the rearguard, rallied his troops and forced the mercenaries to retreat behind the city's walls, inflicting heavy casualties on them in the process.|$|E
5|$|The public {{remained}} mostly {{unaware of}} mass burials {{on the site}} until the 1990s, until the Sankofa Society conducted a well-publicized blessing ceremony in 1991. Kolkana refused to sell or donate the land <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of West Palm Beach, but halted any plans for construction on the property. In 1992, city work crews located human remains on the property using a backhoe. The bones were reburied, but their locations were marked. Resident Robert Hazard established the Storm of '28 Memorial Park Coalition in 1999 as a non-profit organization used to reacquire the land and solicit donations for a memorial complex. The complex was originally intended to include an educational center and a museum about African American pioneers and migrant farm workers, {{at a cost of}} approximately $6.1million. Organizations such as the Sankofa Society proposed a less sophisticated plan of erecting an information wall and a large marble headstone, at a far less expensive cost of about $43,000.|$|E

5|$|By contrast, {{a massive}} crowd of {{thousands}} of Chinese soldiers and civilians from {{the south side of}} Nanking, who were fleeing in panic and disarray from the advance of Japan's 10th Army on the same night, were prevented from reaching the harbor at Xiaguan by Chinese barrier troops who fired on the crowd for retreating without permission and managed to hold it back. At 9:00 pm a fleeing Chinese tank unit, which had also not received Tang's parting message, charged the barrier troops and burst through their blockade, only for the crowd to then find that there were hardly any boats remaining in the harbor. The crowd fought to clamber aboard what few craft were available, but these soon became so overloaded that they sank midway. The rest of the Chinese soldiers took to the Yangtze's rough and frigid waters en masse while clinging to logs and pieces of scrap lumber, though most were quickly swallowed up by the river. Furthermore, by this point the Japanese encirclement of Nanking was virtually complete and many who were attempting to brave the Yangtze soon found themselves being fired upon {{from both sides of the}} river. Others who saw this turned <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> in despair.|$|E
5|$|However, Sparta {{was then}} thrown into disarray by {{internal}} machinations. The citizens of Aegina had {{submitted to the}} Persian ambassadors, and the Athenians, troubled {{by the possibility of}} Persia using Aegina as a naval base, asked Sparta to intervene. Cleomenes travelled to Aegina to confront the Aeginetans personally, but they appealed to Cleomenes's fellow king Demaratus, who supported their stance. Cleomenes responded by having Demaratus declared illegitimate, {{with the help of the}} priests at Delphi (whom he bribed); Demaratus was replaced by his cousin Leotychides. Now faced with two Spartan kings, the Aeginetans capitulated, and handed over hostages to the Athenians as a guarantee of their good behaviour. However, in Sparta news emerged of the bribes Cleomenes had given at Delphi, and he was expelled from the city. He then sought to rally the northern Peloponnesus to his cause, at which the Spartans relented, and invited him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> By 491 BC though, Cleomenes was widely considered insane and was sentenced to prison where he was found dead the following day.

After forging the date of birth on his birth certificate, he joined the Red Cross in September 1918 as an ambulance driver. He was shipped to France but arrived in November, after the armistice.

5|$|Monroe's early {{childhood}} was stable and happy. While Gladys was mentally and financially unprepared for a child, {{she was able}} to place Monroe with foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the rural town of Hawthorne soon after the birth. They raised their foster children according to the principles of evangelical Christianity. At first, Gladys lived with the Bolenders and commuted to work in Los Angeles, until longer work shifts forced her to move <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> in early 1927. She then began visiting her daughter on weekends, often taking her to the cinema and to sightsee in Los Angeles. Although the Bolenders wanted to adopt Monroe, by the summer of 1933, Gladys felt stable enough for Monroe to move in with her and bought a small house in Hollywood. They shared it with lodgers, actors George and Maude Atkinson and their daughter, Nellie. Some months later, in January 1934, Gladys had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After several months in a rest home, she was committed to the Metropolitan State Hospital. She spent {{the rest of her life}} in and out of hospitals, and was rarely in contact with Monroe.|$|E

The franchise were purchased by Philadelphian Irv Kosloff and Ike Richma in the spring of 1963; the NBA approved their franchise shift on May 22 and name change to the Philadelphia 76ers on August 6.
