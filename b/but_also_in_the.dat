5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} {{for the treatment of}} anxiety disorders, especially of panic disorder, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder. It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E

5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} other animals can be transmitted by ticks, the species of tick involved tending to be those with a wide host range. Spread of disease {{in this way is}} enhanced by the extended time during which a tick remains attached, during which time the mobile host can be carried long distances, {{or in the case of}} bird hosts, across the sea. The infective agents can be present not only in the adult tick <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eggs produced plentifully by the females. Many tick species have extended their ranges as a result of the movements of people, their pets and livestock. With increasing participation in outdoor activities such as wilderness hikes, more people and their dogs may find themselves exposed to attack.|$|E
5|$|Deities {{were present}} {{not only in}} the heavens, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human body itself. They were {{responsible}} for maintaining the body's five viscera, guarding the registers of life, and regulating the souls. There were five internal deities that were particularly important in Lingbao Daoism. The Great Unity lived in the head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the liver and lungs. The Director of Destinies lived in the heart and sexual organs, and finally, the Peach Child lived in the lower dantian. Normally these deities resided in the heavens, but they could be activated by scriptural recitations to descend into the body.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{receiving}} praise in pre-release showings, Sonic the Hedgehog {{was released}} to notably negative reception. Criticism {{was directed at}} the game's perceived lack of polish, with reviewers citing long loading times, a poor camera system, gameplay glitches, a complicated plot, and imprecise control. It has been considered among the worst games {{not only in the}} Sonic series <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> video game medium. Sega delisted the game from retailers in 2010 following its decision to remove all Sonic games with below-average Metacritic scores to increase the value of the brand.|$|E
5|$|From {{the moment}} Thriller was released, it set the {{standard}} for the music industry: artists, record labels, producers, marketers and even choreographers. The music video was ahead of its time and it is considered a monumental one—not only in Jackson's career, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of pop music. Epic Records' approach to creating a song and video that would appeal to the mass market ended up influencing the way that professionals now market and release their songs. John Landis's production of a mini-movie, rather than the usual short music video, would raise the bar for other directors and producers.|$|E
5|$|Historically, insects {{have been}} the most {{significant}} herbivores, and the evolution of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects. While most plant defenses are directed against insects, other defenses have evolved that are aimed at vertebrate herbivores, such as birds and mammals. The study of plant defenses against herbivory is important, not only from an evolutionary view point, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direct impact that these defenses have on agriculture, including human and livestock food sources; as beneficial 'biological control agents' in biological pest control programs; {{as well as in the}} search for plants of medical importance.|$|E

5|$|Kumi-daiko performance, {{characterized}} by an ensemble playing on different drums, was developed in 1951 through the work of Daihachi Oguchi and has continued with groups such as Kodo. Other performance styles, such as hachijō-daiko, have also emerged from specific communities in Japan. Kumi-daiko performance groups are active not only in Japan, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, Australia, Canada, and Brazil. Taiko performance consists of many components in technical rhythm, form, stick grip, clothing, and the particular instrumentation. Ensembles typically use different types of barrel-shaped nagadō-daiko as well as smaller shime-daiko. Many groups accompany the drums with vocals, strings, and woodwind instruments.|$|E
5|$|Maribor's Academy is {{responsible}} for youth development at the club, {{with the goal of}} developing young players for the future. The academy is composed of eleven youth selections, ranging from U7 to U19. Totally, there are over 210 youth players in the system who are trained by professional staff within the club. The vision of the club and its youth system is not only to produce new players but also to prepare young children for the future and life without football. Therefore, each child {{who wants to be a}} member of the academy must also be successful not only on the football field, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of education. The club has also spread the football school activities to primary schools in the city of Maribor and the surrounding area, where around 500 of the youngest footballers train as part of the Children's Football School.|$|E

5|$|The largest {{chemical}} {{diversity among}} actinides is observed in americium, which can have valence between 2 and 6. Divalent americium is obtained only in dry compounds and non-aqueous solutions (acetonitrile). Oxidation states +3, +5 and +6 are typical for aqueous solutions, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> solid state. Tetravalent americium forms stable solid compounds (dioxide, fluoride and hydroxide) {{as well as}} complexes in aqueous solutions. It was reported that in alkaline solution americium can be oxidized to the heptavalent state, but these data proved erroneous. The most stable valence of americium is 3 in the aqueous solutions and 3 or 4 in solid compounds.|$|E
5|$|The sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus) is a predatory blenny, an {{aggressive}} mimic which accurately resembles the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, {{not only in}} colour and pattern, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ritualised dance the cleaner wrasse makes when potential client fish swim nearby. However, instead of providing the cleaning service that it signals, it bites off pieces of healthy skin, scales and mucus from the host and then swims rapidly away to safety.|$|E
