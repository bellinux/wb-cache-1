50|$|Roosevelt {{gave birth}} to the couple's {{daughter}} at 8:30 pm on February 12, 1884; the child was named Alice Lee Roosevelt. Her husband, then a member of the New York State Assembly, was in Albany attending to business <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Assembly floor. He had been convinced their child would be <b>born</b> <b>on</b> Valentine's Day, <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> anniversary of their engagement. After Assemblyman Roosevelt received a telegram the morning of the 13th notifying him of the birth, he made arrangements to leave that afternoon and be with his wife. Another telegram was sent and received regarding her ill health, and she was in a semi-comatose state by the time he arrived home, around midnight.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is the {{evaluation}} of performance of basic herd in breeding of ZVPP Doublovičky of Agricultural Company Kosova Hora a. s. The age structure of the herd {{and the results of}} rearing piglets were evaluated. The results of rearing piglets were compared with PIC breeding aims. Basic herd was consisted of 480 - 530 sows. The herd was divided into 4 groups for assessing the age structure of herd - gilts, sows on 1 st and 2 nd litters, 3 rd to 5 th litters, 6 th and higher litters. Sows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 6 th and higher litters had the majority (35, 9 %). It was also evaluated the decommissioning of sows. The most common reason was the age or musculoskeletal disorders for exclusion. Indicators of fertility were evaluated too - the total number of born, the number of live born and weaned piglets. For this monitoring the basic herd was divided into reproductive and productive herd. Comparing with the objectives of PIC, the results of monitored sows were about 0. 8 - 1 piglet smaller than the PIC breeding aims. Fertility was also monitored according to parity number. The highest number of live <b>born</b> piglets was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> litter. Losses of live born piglets to weaning were 11. 2 %. Most gilts were embedded first in the age of 216 - 225 days. In the pursued breeding piglets were weaned mostly around the 20 th day. In 2014 the intensity of fertility was 2. 44 litter per sow per year, while the PIC breeding aims are 2. 4 litter per sow per year...|$|R
