5|$|Kill 'Em All was {{released}} on July 25, 1983 by Megaforce with an initial pressing of 15,000 copies. Because of the label's financial restrictions, the album was pressed in <b>batches</b> of 500 <b>copies.</b> Kill 'Em All had sold 17,000 copies in the U.S. {{by the end of}} the year. Similarly to punk rock acts, Metallica promoted its material through the tape trading network and independent music magazines such as Metal Forces in the UK and Metal Mania in the U.S. The album did not enter the Billboard 200 chart until 1986, when it peaked at number 155 following Metallica's commercial success with its third studio album Master of Puppets. The 1988 re-issue on Elektra Records also charted on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 120. It was certified 3× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1999 for shipping three million copies in the United States. Despite being the lowest selling Metallica studio album, it helped the band establish its image and build a fanbase in its inaugural years.|$|R
40|$|Declining {{usage of}} print {{materials}} along with increasing usage of electronic resources makes {{it necessary for}} libraries to reallocate personnel from print management to electronic resources management. Electronic resources management should be {{the primary focus of}} technical services units in the early twenty-first century. Print should no longer be treated as the default format, and the work of library staff must be reorganized and reintegrated with librarians and other professionals to reflect the growing importance of electronic resources in contemporary information services. Staff workflows in technical services can be organized to emphasize functional areas of electronic resources management including troubleshooting, collection analysis support, and content management that best fulfill the contemporary library’s mission. More established workflows, such as <b>batch</b> processing and <b>copy</b> cataloging, can also be improved through better coordination with other personnel who manage electronic resources. Fitting the work of a new technical services system into the library’s wider mission requires good communication and coordination with other units, as well. Workflows for technical services functions must be carefully integrated horizontally or vertically into the workflows of other units in a systematic way that fosters cooperation and accountability while avoiding confusion regarding roles and responsibilities...|$|R
40|$|Machine {{virtualization}} {{has become}} a cornerstone of modern datacenters. It enables server consolidation {{as a means to}} reduce costs and increase efficiencies. The communication endpoints within the datacenter are now virtual machines (VMs), not physical servers. Consequently, the datacenter network now extends into the server and last hop switching occurs inside the server. Today, thanks to increasing core counts on processors, server VM densities are on the rise. This trend is placing enormous pressure on the network I/O subsystem and the last hop virtual switch to support efficient communication, both internal and external to the server. But the current state-of-the-art solutions fall short of these requirements. This thesis presents new architectures and mechanisms for the network subsystem in virtualized servers to build efficient virtualization platforms. Specifically, there are three primary contributions in this thesis. First, it presents a new mechanism to reduce memory sharing overheads in driver domain-based I/O architectures. The key idea is to enable a guest operating system to reuse its I/O buffers that are shared with a driver domain. Second, it describes Hyper-Switch, a highly streamlined, efficient, and scalable software-based virtual switching architecture, specifically for hypervisors that support driver domains. The Hyper-Switch combines the best of the existing architectures by hosting the device drivers in a driver domain to isolate any faults and placing the virtual switch in the hypervisor to perform efficient packet switching. Further, the Hyper-Switch implements several optimizations, such as virtual machine state-aware <b>batching,</b> preemptive <b>copying,</b> and dynamic offloading of packet processing to idle CPU cores, to enable efficient packet processing, better utilization of the available CPU resources, and higher concurrency. This architecture eliminates the memory sharing overheads associated with driver domains. Third, this thesis proposes an alternate virtual switching architecture, called sNICh, which explores the idea of server/switch integration. The sNICh is a combined network interface card (NIC) and datacenter switching accelerator. This takes the Hyper-Switch architecture one step further. It offloads the data plane of the switch to the network device, eliminating driver domains entirely...|$|R

5000|$|Kill Em All has {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Bernard Doe of Metal Forces described Kill Em All {{as one of}} the fastest and heaviest albums ever recorded, and remarked that the album is not for the faint-hearted. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune acknowledged it as the [...] "speed metal prototype", but felt the lyrical replication of Judas Priest and the Misfits kept the album short from becoming a classic. In a retrospective review, Billboard praised Kill Em All for changing the face of popular music with its unique combination of punk and metal. AllMusics Steve Huey called it [...] "the true birth of thrash". He praised Hetfields highly technical rhythm guitar style and said that the band was [...] "playing with tightly controlled fury even at the most ridiculously fast tempos". Rob Kemp, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide, credited the album for consolidating the punk rock and heavy metal scenes, but felt that apart from [...] "Seek & Destroy" [...] and [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth", most of the album had the band [...] "trying to look tough" [...] over enthusiastic but unfinished riff-based songs. Journalist Martin Popoff said Kill Em All differentiated from the debuts by Metallicas Bay Area contemporaries because the fans could identify with Hetfields lyrics and the bands appearance. Spins Chuck Eddy considered Kill Em All the inception of the [...] "extreme metal mania" [...] of the early 1980s. He noted the album did not receive much critical praise {{at the time of its}} release, but said it aged well and opened the doors for the less commercially successful bands. Although McIver credits Venoms Welcome to Hell (1981) as the first thrash metal album, he acknowledged Kill Em All as a major influence on the flourishing American heavy metal scene. Despite its [...] "less-than-perfect" [...] production, Loudwires Jon Wiederhorn said that Kill Em All sounds like an [...] "influential slice of history" [...] and stands on the same level as classic albums by Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, and Judas Priest. Kill Em All was released on July 25, 1983 by Megaforce with an initial pressing of 15,000 copies. Because of the labels financial restrictions, the album was pressed in <b>batches</b> of 500 <b>copies.</b> Kill Em All had sold 17,000 copies in the U.S. by the end of the year.

Despite being the lowest selling Metallica studio album, it helped the band establish its image and build a fanbase in its inaugural years. Kill Em All, as the first thrash metal album released in the U.S., had substantial impact on the emerging scene and inspired numerous bands with its aggression and austere seriousness. Guitarist Kerry King acknowledged Slayer was still finding its sound while Metallica had already determined its image and musical identity. Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian was impressed by the albums heaviness and songwriting, and said it influenced him as much as the albums by Iron Maiden. Dream Theaters drummer Mike Portnoy observed that Kill Em All surpassed the NWOBHM bands in terms of sheer velocity and cited Burtons bass solo as the albums peak. Guitarist Ulf Cederlund of Swedish black metal band Morbid cited [...] "Motorbreath" [...] and [...] "Metal Militia" [...] as songs that influenced him as a young musician. Kill Em All was ranked at number 35 on Rolling Stones list of The 100 Greatest Albums of the 80s. Additionally, the album placed at number 54 on [...] "The 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time" [...] and again at number 35 on [...] "100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time", two lists compiled by the same magazine.
