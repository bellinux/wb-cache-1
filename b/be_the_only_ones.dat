5|$|At dawn on {{the third}} day, ukukus grouped by {{moieties}} climb the glaciers on Qullqipunku to retrieve crosses set on top. Some ukukus traditionally spent the night on the glacier to combat spirits. They also cut and bring back blocks of the ice, which {{is believed to have}} sacred medicinal qualities. The ukukus are considered to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> capable of dealing with condenados, the cursed souls said to inhabit the snowfields. According to oral traditions, ukukus from different moieties used to engage in ritual battles on the glaciers, but this practice was banned by the Catholic Church. After a mass celebrated later this day, most pilgrims leave the sanctuary. One group carries the Lord of Quyllurit'i in procession to Tayankani before taking it back to Mawallani.|$|E

25|$|The Modigliani {{estate is}} one of the most {{problematic}} in the art world. There are at least five catalogues raisonnés of the artist’s work including a volume by Ambrogio Ceroni, last updated in 1972. Arthur Pfannstiel (1929 and 1956) and Joseph Lanthemann's (1970) books are widely dismissed today. Milanese scholar Osvaldo Patani produced three volumes: paintings (1991), drawings (1992) and one on the Paul Alexandre period (1994), while Christian Parisot has published Volumes I, II and IV (in 1970, 1971 and 1996) of a catalogue raisonné. In 2006, about 6,000 documents from the estate—believed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> existing—were moved permanently from France to Italy. Parisot, as president of the Modigliani Institut Archives Legales in Rome, had the legal right to authenticate Modigliani’s work. In 2013, Parisot was arrested by the Italian art forgery unit after a two-year investigation; the police seized works attributed to the artist, along with suspect authenticity certificates.|$|E

It was released on 4 June 2012, by the Greco-Roman label, its remix EP, which features a re-cut of [...] "Control" [...] by Hot Chip's Joe Goddard, distributed in September 2012. The four-track record, which contains musical styles of balearic beat, UK garage, dubstep and techno, features vocal contributions from Sinéad Harnett and Ria Ritchie. It was described by one reviewer as more a [...] "youthful" [...] release of a dubstep and techno scene consisting of artists like James Blake and Little Dragon. The EP is a big departure from their previous works in terms of musical style, its few post-dubstep elements to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> that were also present on their past releases. Promoted one single, [...] "Boiling", and one music video for [...] "Control", The Face garnered critical acclaim, major praises being towards {{the quality of the}} EP's musical style and song structures.|$|E

PopSugar gave a positive {{review of the}} episode, writing: [...] "Derek and Mark seem to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> who are keeping their cool." [...] However, they also felt that Meredith was [...] "out of chararacter", commenting: [...] "Though Meredith also kept it together, her optimism is so out of character that {{it can only be}} chalked up to the crisis, and even she recognizes it." [...] While Yang was on pediatric service, she impersonated a bear, and PopSugar called her voice [...] "priceless". They were also positive about Stevens' storyline, saying: [...] "At first it seemed super annoying but was pretty sweet {{by the end of the}} episode." [...] PopSugar also enjoyed Lexie's storyline, commenting that [...] "she proves her worth in the end".|$|E
500|$|P.exclamans {{lives in}} a {{hierarchical}} society with one queen that lays the eggs. However, all of the females have the same morphology {{and they all have}} the physiological capability of taking over the egg laying if necessary (queen death, queen migration). Since the queen has the same morphology {{as the rest of the}} workers in the colony, this raises the question as to how the queen role is assigned and what makes her special. Studies have found that queens and males have higher levels of glucose, fructose and trehalose than workers, leading to higher cryoprotectant levels. P.exclamans use these sugars as cryoprotectant, which work by increasing the solute concentration in cells. This results in a greater survivability in colder weather. It was found that queens have a 76% survival rate in [...] weather compared to 17% survival of the workers over a 15-day test period. The queens also have a 0.5mm layer of fat surrounding their bodies. This allows them to live longer into the winter and possibly extend their mating season. The queens seem to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> capable of diapause.|$|E
