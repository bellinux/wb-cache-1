A biofilm is any group {{of microorganisms}} in which cells stick to each other and often also to a surface. These adherent cells become embedded within a slimy extracellular matrix that is composed of extracellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substances</b> (EPS). The EPS components are produced by the cells within the biofilm and are typically a polymeric conglomeration of extracellular DNA, proteins, and polysaccharides.

40|$|The {{biological}} community in activated sludge wastewater plants is organized within this ecosystem as bioaggregates or flocs, {{in which the}} biotic component is embedded in a complex matrix comprised of extracellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substances</b> mainly of microbial origin. The aim of this work is to study the role of different floc-associated ciliates commonly reported in wastewater treatment plants-crawling Euplotes and sessile Vorticella- {{in the formation of}} aggregates. Flocs, in experiments with ciliates and latex beads, showed more compactation and cohesion among particles than those in the absence of ciliates. Ciliates have been shown to contribute to floc formation through different mechanisms such as the active secretion of <b>polymeric</b> <b>substances</b> (extrusomes), their biological activities (movement and feeding strategies), or the cysts formation capacity of some species. Staining with lectins coupled to fluorescein showed that carbohydrate of the matrix contained glucose, manose, N-acetyl-glucosamine and galactose.

In {{order to}} study the {{relationship}} between extracellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substances</b> (EPS) and membrane fouling, the effect of extracellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substances</b> (EPS) on the operation of membrane bioreactor (MBR) was investigated in this paper. The operation of membrane was analyzed by evaluating sludge volume index (SVI), modified fouling index (MFI), and membrane resistance (Rt), respectively. The results showed that SVI, MFI, and Rt increased with the accumulation of EPS, and membrane fouling aggravated {{with the increase of}} EPS, this illustrated that the content of EPS had a direct influence on SVI, MFI, Rt and membrane fouling.

40|$|This study {{elucidates}} {{the enhancement}} of aerobic granulation by zero-valent iron (ZVI). A reactor augmented with ZVI had a start-up time of aerobic granulation (43 days) that was notably less than that for a reactor without augmentation (64 days). The former reactor also had better removal efficiencies for chemical oxygen demand and ammonium. Moreover, the mature granules augmented with ZVI had better physical characteristics and produced more extracellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substances</b> (especially of protein). Three-dimensional-excitation emission matrix fluorescence showed that ZVI enhanced organic material diversity. Additionally, ZVI enhanced {{the diversity of the}} microbial community.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{application of}} membrane bioreactors (MBRs) for municipal wastewater treatment is hampered by membrane fouling. Fouling increases energy demand, reduces process performance and creates {{the need for}} more frequent (chemical) membrane cleaning or replacement. Membrane fouling in MBRs is known to be caused by several membrane fouling mechanisms. Extracellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substances</b> (EPS) play a major role during fouling development. However, EPS concentration in the bulk solution can not be generally used as an indicator for fouling propensity.

40|$|The {{extremely}} halophilic archaebacterium Haloferax mediterranei {{produces an}} exocellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substance</b> {{that gives the}} colonies a typical mucous character and {{is responsible for the}} appearance of a superficial layer in unshaken liquid medium. This exocellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substance</b> can be obtained from the supernatant of shaken liquid cultures by cold ethanol precipitation, and yields as high as 3 mg/ml have been detected. The substance was produced under all the conditions tested and with all substrates assayed, although higher yields were obtained with sugars, particularly glucose, as carbon and energy source. The total exocellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substance</b> produced was proportional to the total biomass. The polymer is a heteropolysaccharide containing mannose as the major component. Glucose, galactose, and another unidentified sugar were also present, as well as amino sugars, uronic acids, and a considerable amount of sulfate, which accounts for the acidic nature of the polymer. The infrared spectrum and specific assays showed the absence of acyl groups. The rheological properties of polymer solutions were studied, showing a pseudoplastic behavior and a high apparent viscosity at relatively low concentrations. Viscosity was remarkably resistant to extremes of pH, temperature, or salinity. These characteristics make this polymer interesting for enhanced oil recovery and other applications for which a very resistant thickening agent is required...|$|R

However, the binding mechanism of aluminum ion (Al 3 +) and extracellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substances</b> (EPS) in activated sludge is unclear due {{to the complexity of}} EPS. In this work, three-dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (3 DEEM), fluorescence quenching titration and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were used to explore the binding behavior and mechanism between Al 3 + and EPS. The results showed that two fluorescence peaks of tyrosine- and tryptophan-like substances were identified in the loosely bound-extracellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substances</b> (LB-EPS), and three peaks of tyrosine-, tryptophan- and humic-like substances were identified in the tightly bound-extracellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substances</b> (TB-EPS). It was found that these fluorescence peaks could be quenched with Al 3 + at the dosage of 3. 0 mg/L, which demonstrated that strong interactions took place between the EPS and Al 3 +. The conditional stability constants for Al 3 + and EPS were determined by the Stern-Volmer equation. As to the binding mechanism, the -OH, N-H, C=O, C-N groups and the sulfur- and phosphorus-containing groups showed complexation action, although the groups in the LB-EPS and TB-EPS showed different behavior. The TB-EPS have stronger binding ability to Al 3 + than the LB-EPS, and TB-EPS {{play an important role in}} the interaction with Al 3 +...|$|R

Although protein contents in extracellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substances</b> increased along with granulation in both reactors, protein content in EPS of Ce 3 +-fed granules was higher than that without Ce 3 + addition. Polysaccharide contents in extracellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substances</b> decreased slightly through the experiment in the two reactors.
