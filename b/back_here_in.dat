500|$|In {{the first}} Democratic primary debate, the presidential {{candidates}} were asked whether black lives matter or all lives matter. In reply, Bernie Sanders stated, [...] "Black lives matter." [...] Martin O'Malley said, [...] "Black lives matter," [...] and that the [...] "movement is making is a very, very legitimate and serious point, {{and that is that}} as a nation we have undervalued the lives of black lives, people of color." [...] In response, Hillary Clinton pushed for criminal justice reform, and said, [...] "We need a new New Deal for communities of color." [...] Jim Webb, on the other hand, replied: [...] "As the president of the United States, every life in this country matters." [...] Hillary Clinton was not directly asked the same question, but was instead asked: [...] "What would you do for African Americans in this country that President Obama couldn't?" [...] Clinton had already met with Black Lives Matter representatives, and emphasized what she described as a more pragmatic approach to enacting change, stating [...] "Look, I don't believe you change hearts. I believe you change laws". Without policy change, she felt [...] "we'll be <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> 10 years having the same conversation." [...] In June 2015, Clinton used the phrase [...] "all lives matter" [...] in a speech about the opportunities of young people of color, prompting backlash that she may misunderstand the message of [...] "Black Lives Matter" ...|$|E

[...] "I {{think it}} is {{definitely}} good for when we come <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> September but past success doesn't guarantee future success," [...] he said. [...] "We have to keep working and plugging away. I am {{sure a lot of}} guys will be stronger and hopefully we will be too." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 'The sky {{is a deep}} blue, rejoicing the eye and the soul; a few {{thin white}} clouds glide serenely over that {{celestial}} sea, like the swans of legends. And there am I, walking alone and deeply sad, thinking {{of those who were}} going home and of those who would in their turn be coming <b>back</b> <b>here.</b> <b>In</b> the distance a solemn bell begins to toll, softly; it seems to speak to people of the misery of all those who could neither go home nor come back.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{go and do}} your wooing, man, {{and come}} <b>back</b> <b>here</b> to me <b>in</b> three months, for I doubt not by then the flames of war will have been kindled against me again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, all {{you have}} to do now, Pedro, is to hire a pilot. Get the best man that you can find. I want one who knows every foot of the Virgin Islands. We are going there first. It does not matter so much about his knowing San Domingo, for as we shall {{probably}} come <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> we can put him ashore and get another pilot specially for San Domingo. Be sure you get the best man that you can find, whatever his terms are. We will be <b>back</b> again <b>here</b> <b>in</b> half an hour.|$|R

2500|$|....the {{current system}} {{to secure the}} return of these {{abducted}} American children does not work and will not work unless it is changed profoundly. [...] I don't doubt the sincerity or {{the dedication of the}} professionals in the State Department who have lead responsibility for this problem, but {{they do not have the}} tools and powers to do their job effectively. [...] And unless Congress gives them the power and the tools we will be <b>back</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> five years or 10 years with another set of hearings, another group of parents with broken hearts and devastated dreams, and we will be making the same statements we are making today." ...|$|E

I may have wasted time in {{wondering}} where my duty lay, but I think I was waiting for a sign.

[...] "The little thing would get along a good deal better with a woman, an' we can sneak <b>back</b> <b>here</b> once <b>in</b> awhile to make certain she's all right.

6000|$|FANNY. Because I didn't know. Do you think--[she rises]--that if I had I {{would ever}} have married him--to be brought <b>back</b> <b>here</b> and put <b>in</b> this ridiculous position? Do you think that I am so fond of you all that I couldn't keep away from you, at any price? ...|$|R

We've {{heard it before}} in 'I Need Your Love' and it's <b>back</b> <b>here</b> again <b>in</b> full force for yet another magical combination." [...] Heather Phares of AllMusic felt that the track [...] "doesn't quite recapture the magic of and Goulding's previous work but does {{make the most of}} her deceptively powerful soprano, this time in a more upbeat setting." [...] Slant Magazine's James Rainis opined that [...] "the most notable characteristic of 'Outside' ... is that the hook's cadence is exactly the same as the Carly Rae Jepsen/Owl City song 'Good Time,' but it lacks that song's cutesy charm." [...] Chase Hunt of AXS viewed the song as [...] "a decent pairing but an expected outcome." ...|$|R

I made so sure that you would wish to go with your husband, in case... in case he insisted on running his head into the noose, which I feel sure Chauvelin has {{prepared}} for him.... I myself start for France shortly. Citizen Chauvelin has provided me with the necessary passport for myself and my maid, who was to have accompanied me.... Then, just now, when I was all alone... and thought over all the mischief which that fiend had forced me to do for him, {{it seemed to me that}} perhaps..." ...|$|R

You will get them on shore by tonight, and then tomorrow I will sail with you to Leyden and the Hague, and aid you in getting your cargo into the right hands there. Now that my mother and the girls are here my father {{will be able to}} spare me. We can be <b>back</b> <b>here</b> again <b>in</b> four or five days, and by that time I hope he will be so far recovered as to be able to think matters over, and come to some decision as to the future management of the brig. Of course if he wishes me to stay on board her I shall obey his orders, whether you or another are the captain." ...|$|R
