After a number of days pass (marked by the cliché device of {{fluttering}} calendar pages), he receives a reply in the form of a package. Inside is a tablet, which he throws into the pool. The water starts to churn and the dark-haired Danny Di Cioccio emerges to Donovan's delight. The two couple <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Di Cioccio in a variety of positions. Di Cioccio turns the tables and tops Donovan until Donovan's climax. The scene closes with the two engaged in horseplay in the pool and then walking off together down a boardwalk.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s, The Beverly Hills Hotel became {{increasingly}} popular with Hollywood film stars. Fred Astaire took a shine to the hotel, and enjoyed reading the Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> Cesar Romero and Carole Lombard were pictured {{together at the}} hotel in 1937. In 1938, the Sand and Pool Club was established at the hotel. It proved extremely popular, with white sand imported from Arizona, which made the pool area look like a beach. The following year, it began hosting fashion shows sponsored by local department stores such as Bullock's Wilshire. In 1940, one of the hotel's long-time patrons, Marlene Dietrich, was instrumental in bringing about a change in policy in the Polo Lounge, which had made it compulsory for women to don skirts which she refused to wear.|$|E

At first Jacqui is furious at Mercedes for this and yells at her causing them both to start crying. After insulting Mercedes Jacqui forgives her and tells her that she love her.

[...] The party, held on 5 September 1987, has been {{described}} as [...] "the most incredible example of excess the Mediterranean island had ever seen", and was attended by some 700 people. A cake in the shape of Gaudi's Sagrada Família was provided for the party, although the original cake collapsed and was replaced with a 2-metre-long sponge with the notes from Mercury's song [...] "Barcelona". The bill, which included 232 broken glasses, was presented to Queen's manager, Jim Beach.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} pilot filmed was darker in tone {{than the}} one aired. Thomas intended to take the script to FX, HBO or Showtime, but gave UPN [...] "credit" [...] as they only wanted it a bit lighter to match their standards and practices. There was also a lengthy debate as to whether Veronica could be a rape victim; UPN eventually consented. In the aired version of the pilot, Lilly Kane was found <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> {{in the same spot}} where she was murdered. However, Thomas stated that Lilly's body was originally going {{to be found in the}} ocean, and he had a plan for events which led to Lilly's body being dumped. When Thomas pitched the idea to UPN, the network felt that it was [...] "too dark and creepy" [...] for Jake Kane to dispose of his daughter's body to protect his son, and the idea was changed.|$|E

After the autopsy, it is determined that Irving suffered from a prion disease called kuru, which has not been found in the United States before. Mulder believes that kuru was given to him by a hex that caused him to go mad. The Wieders then find a family photo missing from their bedroom, and a [...] "hoodoo man", later revealed to be named Orell Peattie (Billy Drago), is seen placing the faces cut from the picture into various poppet dolls.

She later leaves the room, and the video then shows the Sugababes sitting on a bench near the pool. Range is shown on the stage in a nightclub disco as a stripper. Like Mutya Buena, she acts up the courage and leaves her profession, then she throws the microphone into the water in the nightclub [...] Meanwhile, all three Sugababes appear under the running water of a shower tap, and are shown dancing with the group of women from the previous scenes. The final scenes of the video show three children swimming underwater in the pool, resembling the members of the Sugababes.|$|E
500|$|Like in The Kampung Boy, {{the scenes}} in Yesterday and Today are {{presented}} in great detail. [...] Lat shows the children playing with items constructed from simple items found in the household and nature. [...] He also illustrates the toys' schematics. [...] He compares the games with their modern counterparts, lamenting the loss of creativity in modern youths. [...] Other comments on societal changes are in the book. [...] A child is taking a swimming lesson in a pool, intently watched by his parents who have a maid in tow with various items in her hands. [...] While the parents gesticulate wildly at their son, the lifeguard and instructor calmly sit <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> watching the boy's smooth progress. [...] This scene is contrasted with Lat's own experience {{at the hands of}} his father, who casually tosses the terrified boy into a river, letting him either swim or flounder.

500|$|Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) is {{established}} in the first portion of the film as a [...] "vaguely arrogant", but apparently successful, director who endures one humiliation after another. Theroux said of his role, [...] "He's sort of the one character in the film who doesn't know what the [...] going on. I think he's the one guy the audience says, 'I'm kind of like you right now. I don't know why you're being subjected to all this pain. After being stripped of creative control of his film, he is cuckolded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> cleaner (played by Billy Ray Cyrus), and thrown {{out of his own}} opulent house above Hollywood. After he checks into a seedy motel and pays with cash, the manager arrives to tell him that his credit is no good. Witnessed by Diane, Adam is pompous and self-important. He is the only character whose personality does not seem to change completely from {{the first part of the}} film to the second. One analysis of Adam's character contends that because he capitulated and chose Camilla Rhodes for his film, that is the end of Betty's cheerfulness and ability to help Rita, placing the blame for her tragedy on the representatives of studio power.|$|E
500|$|The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer {{office was}} located in the same building, and Bakshi spoke to then-president Dan Melnick.

Bakshi then contacted Saul Zaentz (who had helped finance Fritz the Cat) to ask him to produce The Lord of the Rings, and Zaentz agreed. Before the production started, the original three-part adaptation was negotiated down to two parts at United Artists, and Bakshi met with Tolkien's daughter Priscilla to discuss how the film would be made. She showed him the room where her father did his writing and drawing. Bakshi says, [...] "My promise to Tolkien's daughter was to be pure to the book. I wasn't going to say, 'Hey, throw out Gollum and change these two characters.' My job was to say, 'This is what the genius said.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} for [...] "Lemme See" [...] {{was released on}} June 14, 2012, and was directed by Philip Andelman. The video opens with a close-up of Usher's estate, and a woman bound by ropes. Usher is stood by a swimming pool singing the first verse, with the pool reflecting on him. During the pre-chorus, Usher is leaning against a wall while pulling up his top to reveal his chest. Entering the chorus, the video intercuts to Usher preparing drinks for himself and the tied up woman– his love interest. With the second verse, Usher is admiring his still tied up love interest. In the second pre-chorus, leaned against a wall Usher removes his shirt, while the video intercuts to him approaching his love interest to make love. Entering Rick Ross' verse, Ross is sat down shirtless, accompanied by two women sat by him left and right. Touching Ross' back, their tattoos transfer on to Ross and bloom. Him and Usher are both by a pool with Ross performing his rap, while in an intercut scene Usher's love interest is being released from her tied up predicament. In the final chorus, Usher and his love interest make love in a risqué scene, with both their tattoos moving and blooming on {{to each other in}} a similar way to Ross' scene. This alternates with the latter scene, Usher leaned against the wall and him and Ross <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> with Usher singing the verse.
