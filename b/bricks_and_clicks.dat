Executive Summary Recent dot-com failures have raised a cloud of suspicion over the viability of new ventures known as pure plays, which characteristically enter new markets exclusively via the Internet. Many of these firms have met with unfavorable reaction from the financial markets due to lack of profits and weak capital infrastructure. The strategic efficacy of the pure play model is critical in light of forecasts projecting total Internet electronic commerce ranging between $ 1 and $ 1. 3 trillion by 2003, while the business to consumer sales portion is expected to reach $ 18...|$|R

Additionally, many will also offer telephone ordering and mobile phone apps, or at least provide telephone sales support.

50|$|The <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> {{model has}} {{typically}} {{been used by}} traditional retailers who have extensive logistics and supply chains, but are well known and often respected for their traditional physical presence. Part {{of the reason for}} its success is that it is far easier for a traditional retailer to establish an online presence than it is for a start-up company to employ a successful purely online one, or for an online only retailer to establish a traditional presence, including a strong and well recognised brand, without having a large marketing budget. It can also be said that adoption of a <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> model where a customer can return items to a brick and mortar store can reduce wasted costs to a business such as shipping for undelivered and returned items that would traditionally be incurred.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> {{business}} model can benefit {{various members of}} a customer base. For example, supermarkets often have different customer types requiring alternative shopping options; one group may wish to see the goods directly before purchase and like the convenience of quickly shopping on-the-fly, while another group may require a different convenience of shopping online and getting the order delivered when it suits them, having a <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> model means both customer groups are satisfied. Other previously online-only retailers have stated that they have found benefit in adding a brick-and-mortar presence to their online-only business, as customers can physically see and test products before purchase as well as get advice and support on any purchases they have made. Additionally, consumers are likely to feel safer and have more confidence using a bricks-and-clicks business if they already know the brand from a brick-and-mortar store.|$|E
50|$|An {{advantage}} to the consumer and a potential dis{{advantage to}} businesses is that by adopting a <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> business model and allowing customers to purchase goods or services remotely, it is legislated in many jurisdictions that consumers are granted more rights to protect them. In the UK, for example, any goods purchased from a <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> business over a 'click and collect' service would allow the buyer protection under the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000, namely the right to return a product or cancel a service within 14 days of purchase for a full refund. Similar rights are afforded to EU Residents, who gain protection under European Directive 97/7/EC. In the USA, the Federal Trade Commission legislate specifically over how a distance sale should be conducted and the rights that a consumer has, namely a '3 day' rule allowing items ordered over the web to be returned within three days.|$|E

40|$|For {{the past}} two decades people have been {{responding}} to profound societal changes brought about by the increasing digitization of information and the ubiquity of the internet. Such change has affected libraries dramatically. Librarians have been so successful at extending information resources and services into the cyber-community that some administrators and policy-makers have begun questioning the need for maintaining the physical library. In response to this challenge a body of literature called the “library as place” has emerged in which the integrity of the library proper is examined and redefined. Mirroring this phenomenon, the traditional onsite reference desk is also being re-evaluated. Some believe that, in light of the recent growth of online reference service, the century-old reference desk is now redundant. Many librarians are redefining traditional reference spaces. For some, this has been a gradual process, in which the reference desk has mutated over time; for others, change has come swiftly and has meant a bold redesign of service. This presenation examines onsite reference service at two public, mid-western universities. At Indiana State University (ISU) the library adopted the “Borders bookstore” philosophy several years ago. Community programs such as lectures, meetings, and film series are conducted within the reference desk area. In the midst of such atypical surroundings the desk, {{and the role of the}} reference librarians, has developed —— retaining some traditional traits while adopting new characteristics. In contrast, at Indiana University – Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW), the change was more dramatic. The general reference desk was dismantled and librarians provide reference assistance on a scheduled appointment basis where uninterrupted one-on-one consultation takes place. But as in the ISU example, this reshaping of the physical environment heralded an alteration in the librarians’ role. <b>Brick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Click</b> 2007 Academic library SymposiumFrey, S., & Codispoti, M.

40|$|In Sweden today, the {{consumers}} {{have the opportunity}} to use the different sales channels; physical store, online store <b>and</b> <b>brick</b> <b>and</b> <b>click,</b> a combination of both. For the past decade, the use of ecommerce has spread tremendously and the fashion industry {{is one of the top}} three industries in this category. This, together with the growth of technology, have created new opportunities for consumers during their online shopping. The purpose of this study is to examine the differences between consumers who use physical store, online store or both. This study aims to look into consumers' shopping habits within these sales channels and factors that are affecting them. This study uses a quantitative method with 150 respondents participating in a survey of 16 questions. The respondents consist of women in Stockholm in the age group 15 - 35. The survey is based on theories of sales channels and consumer buying process. The results show that respondents shop more frequently in a physical store than an electronic store. The three most important factors, for respondents that are using both channels, are the price, the fit and the quality. The latter two factors are perceived to be more easily evaluated and detailed in a physical store with physical contact. The traditional retailers, who only shop in a physical store, value service and experience the highest. This is one of the main reasons that they do not shop online because the service and experience are different in each sales channels. However, the price, the fit and the quality share the second place. Also, the brand and the width of the supply are of significance since the availability is greater in e-commerce. These two factors, can along with the price, be prime reasons for onlineshopping. Respondents who never shop online consider safety and shipping/delivery process the main reason for it. This study has therefore come to the conclusion that the ideal marketing strategy for consumers is the <b>brick</b> <b>and</b> <b>click</b> strategy. These two combined channels can compensate for each other's shortcomings and thereby enhance the consumer satisfaction. With a combined sales channel, consumers have also the possibility to use both channels in the buying process and adapt their approaches in the different stages according to their needs, which may differ depending on different circumstances...|$|R

From advertising subject guides to promoting mobile resources, QR Codes are a fun and easy way to provide research assistance to students on the go. Aside from face-to-face sessions, {{it can be hard}} for today's librarians to reach preoccupied students with the tools they need to become information literate. Students are often running from one class to the next or too busy checking Facebook updates on their smart phones to stop by the library for assistance. This is especially true at a commuter college, where students are often on campus for {{a short amount of time}} during the day. That's where QR Codes come in. QR Codes (short for "Quick Response") are a common sight in many Asian countries, but they've only recently begun appearing on advertisements and street signs in the United States. This presentation will examine what exactly QR Codes are and how they are being used in academic libraries to strengthen and enhance the research experience. In addition to highlighting uses at other libraries, the presenter will describe how she has used QR Codes to provide research assistance to students who are often too busy to stop in the library for help. Strategic placement of QR Codes on library instruction handouts, in buildings across campus, and in the library's stacks has allowed students to take control of their own learning and access important research tools (such as mobile databases and online subject guides) as they walk to class or head home for the day.

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to examine}} the current {{strategic}} landscape of UK "bricks and clicks" retailers. The main focus of this work is to consider how e-commerce may provide competitive advantage via an insight into the current strategies employed by UK retailers. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses both secondary and primary data analysis to explore its research questions. The paper begins with {{an overview of the}} e-strategy literature and then goes on to examine the key areas of e-value creation for <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> companies. Next an analysis of the results of a survey of the UK's top 500 retailers tests the existing literature and provides new evidence of emerging e-strategies. Findings - The data analysis in this research reveals significant gaps between theory and practice and leads {{to the development of a}} new model of business "e-value-added". Research limitations/implications - It is difficult to generalise the findings from this survey, given the small number of respondents. Further in-depth qualitative research is needed to enable us to understand better the organisational issues around e-commerce development and implementation. Practical implications - It is suggested that, in order to exploit the internet to its full potential, legacy retailers need to analyse a variety of situational antecedents in order to identify e-value creation opportunities. In addition, they must consider whether integration or separation with <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> operations will deliver the best solution in each value-adding interface. Originality/value - This research offers a new insight into current e-tail strategies for <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> businesses, and as such is likely to be of interest to academics and practitioners alike. ??
