40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new dual circularly polarized antenna for {{ground penetrating radar}} applications. The new antenna design uses four crossed Resistive-Vee Dipoles (RVD) operating in bistatic mode to measure multiple polarizations. The antenna system is able to distinguish radially symmetric and linear targets with its ability to transmit right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) fields and receive both left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP) and RHCP scattered fields. The type of target can be identified by comparing the relative amplitudes of the received LHCP fields and RHCP fields. For example, linear targets such as wires may be identified by equal amounts of scattered LHCP and RHCP fields. Numerical modeling was used to optimize {{the arrangement of the}} four RVDs in the RVD-based CP antenna to have low coupling and good circular polarization at close range. The resulting antenna design is shown to be very effective at finding <b>buried</b> <b>wire</b> targets without being costly. Additional modeling was performed to improve the circular polarization by changing the arm shape and resistive profile of the RVDs. Three methods are developed for estimating the spatial orientation angle of a detected wire target. The first method involves synthesizing transmission and reception of linear polarization at many angles to find the angle that matches the angle of the wire target. The second and third methods involve directly computing the angle of the wire target from the phase difference in the co-polarization and cross-polarization responses. All three methods provide accurate estimates. The RVD-based CP antenna enables strong detection of subsurface targets along with geometry-based classification of targets. The RVD-based CP antenna is well suited for finding <b>buried</b> <b>wires</b> and rejecting miscellaneous clutter that may be present in the ground. Ph. D...|$|R
50|$|Electronic {{training}} {{involves the}} use of an electric shock as an aversive. Common forms are collars which can be triggered remotely, or that are triggered by barking, fencing that delivers a shock when a dog wearing a special collar crosses a <b>buried</b> <b>wire,</b> and mats that can be placed on furniture to deliver a shock. Some aids deliver an aversive such as a spray of citronella when triggered. The use of electric shock aversives for training dogs is the subject of considerable controversy. Supporters claim that the use of electronic devices allows training at a distance and the potential to eliminate self-rewarding behaviour, and point out that properly used, they have less risk of stress and injury than mechanical devices, such as choke chains. Opponents cite the risks of physical and psychological trauma associated with incorrect or abusive use.|$|R

40|$|Special {{methods were}} {{developed}} to arrange 'Buried Wire Gage' inserts flush to the contoured flow surfaces of instrument plugs of a boundary-layer flow apparatus. The fabrication process was aimed at producing proper bonding of the sensor wire to the substrate surface, without causing excessive surface waviness.

The gages were then installed in a flow calibration apparatus and operated from a constant temperature anemometer system {{for a series of}} flow settings to derive the calibration constants of each of the gages.

40|$|The use of two {{identical}} straight thin-wire antennas for {{the detection}} of a <b>buried</b> <b>wire</b> is analyzed with the aid of numerical calculations. The <b>buried</b> <b>wire</b> is located below an interface between two homogeneous half-spaces. The detection setup, which is formed by a transmitting and a receiving wire, is located above the interface. The transmitter is excited by a pulsed voltage in a small gap. A resistance profile according to Wu and King [1965] has been used to suppress the reflections {{at the end of the}} wires. This enhances the visibility of properties of the lower half-space directly from the time response of the current along the receiving antenna. The problem is solved in several steps. First, the electric field integral equation for the total current along a single thin-wire antenna in a homogeneous space is formulated. The result is then used to construct a set of coupled integral equations to describe the currents along all three wires without the resistive load. The integral equations contain the transmitted and reflected fields due to the interface. Next, the set of integral equations is adapted for the resistance profile along the wires of the detection setup. The reflected and transmitted fields in both half-spaces are treated as secondary incident fields in the integral equation for the currents along the wires. In these equations, the response from a pulsed dipole source in the same configuration occurs as a Green's function. The inverse spatial Fourier transformation that occurs in the transmitted and reflected fields is carried out with the aid of a frequency independent, composite Gaussian quadrature rule. The set of coupled integral equations is solved by using the continuous-time discretized-space approach, where the space discretization is kept fixed for all frequencies. This results in a linear system of equations with a fixed dimension which is solved by the conjugate gradient-fast Fourier transform (CG-FFT) method. With the aid of a marching-on-in-frequency scheme, the system is solved for a number of frequencies. Time domain results are obtained by applying an inverse Fourier transformation. Representative numerical results are presented and discussed...|$|R
