40|$|Overwintering larvae of Colletes kincaidii Cockerell were {{obtained}} by removing soil blocks from a large nesting site established in a hardened, vertical sandstone cliff at Bonny Doon, Calif. One sandstone block {{was placed in a}} greenhouse at Logan, Utah, where two emerging females established nests within glass tubes inserted into observation boxes and one female excavated a nest in soil beneath the sandstone block from which she emerged. Observations of nesting biology in glass tube nests showed {{for the first time that}} polyester cell linings are composed of a mixture of salivary and Dufour 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>gland</b> materials. Salivary secretion is first brushed onto nest walls with the glossa; Dufour 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>gland</b> liquid is deposited on top of the salivary layer and brushed into a thin cover layer with the bifid glossa. The careful sequence of glandular deposition, combined with physical evidence obtained during observations, suggests that salivary gland material may carry an enzyme that links lactones derived from the Dufour 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>gland</b> into polyester chains that are incorporated into cell linings. Cell platform construction and how this platform is used to position the female during the act of egg deposition are described. The physical restructuring of the platform into a cell cap immediately after the egg is deposited is also described. Cell provisioning and methods used to deposit the egg are described in detail. Late embryogenesis and immature development were observed in the laboratory using in vivo and in vitro methods. These observations confirm the 1800 rotation of the embryo, eclosion from the egg chorion as a second instar, anus-to-mouth feeding habits of the larva, and the migration pattern of the larva from its position within the egg to the cup-shaped central position on the surface of the cell provisions. Supportive studies in the field confirmed that some females in a nesting population excavate their entire burrow system while others use abandoned nests and extend lateral burrows before constructing cell series in these new excavations; some females use abandoned nests to construct cell series only within the residue cell linings produced by previous generations. These studies also confirmed that anyone cell of C. kincaidii is provisioned with only one pollen host species, but any number of pollen host species can be used by the same individual, different individuals, or populations that are distributed across North America; and that Epeolus compactus Cresson and Paravilla fumosa Hall were found parasitizing C. kincaidii.

40|$|The Dufour's gland of Bombus terrestris workers, of {{different}} ages and {{with varying degrees of}} ovary development, was studied with the aim to verify its involvement in reproduction. Measurements of the diameter and the length of the gland were made using an ocular micrometer adapted to a microscope. Transmission electron microscopy was used to study the morphology of the secretory cells and to analyze the secretory cycle. The glandular cells were considered to be near type II cells of NOIROT and QUENNEDEY (1974), a type that has not been described before in Hymenopterans. The results show that there is a correlation between the degree of ovary development and Dufour's gland activity of workers. The diameter of the gland and the secretory cell activity increased with increasing oocyte size in the ovary.

40|$|Most mammals exhibit {{seasonal}} {{variation in the}} reproductive capacity of one or both sexes. While the female southern hairy-nosed wombat Lasiorhinus latifrons is a known seasonal breeder, the extent of seasonality in the male has not been documented. To examine this, gross body measurements including scrotal diameter and {{the dimensions of the}} accessory gland bulge were recorded and male reproductive tracts were examined between 1993 and 2000. Testes, epididymides and accessory glands from all males were dissected free of connective tissue and weighed. In addition, matched semen samples were collected over four time points in 2000 corresponding to the breeding season (September), immediately post-breeding season (November), during the non-breeding season (January), and immediately before the onset of the next breeding season (June) as determined from female reproductive status. Semen was collected by electro-ejaculation and analysed for volume, sperm number and motility characteristics. Ejaculate volume, total ejaculate sperm number, percentage motile sperm, and the sperm motility rating and index were all significantly elevated in September and significantly lower in November and January. This correlated with a significant increase in body weight, peri-cloacal gland width, and the weights of the prostate, Cowper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>glands,</b> urethral bulb and crus penis.

40|$|The ultrastructural {{characteristics}} of five morphologically distinct regions of sustentacular {{cells in the}} salamander olfactory mucosa are described. 1) The apical region was characterized by a microvillar surface that lay {{below the level of}} the olfactory knob of olfactory receptor neurons and contained endosome-like vesicles and a filamentous array {{at the level of the}} zonula adherens. 2) The supranuclear region contained rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, a Golgi complex, and secretory vesicles. Few sustentacular cells showed morphological signs of secretion, suggesting a low rate of baseline secretory activity. 3) The nuclear region contained the cylindrical nucleus surrounded by a thin band of cytoplasm containing bundles of filaments. 4) The central stalk contained filamentous arrays, Golgi-like cisternae, multivesicular bodies, and peroxisomes. Cytoplasmic veils that extended from the central stalk contained filamentous aggregates. 5) The basilar expansion had a complex series of lateral and basal folds. The lateral folds enveloped extracellular material and nonmyelinated axons of the receptor neurons. The basal folds formed complex interdigitations with the basal lamina, particularly in regions occupied by blood vessels and the acini of Bowman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>glands</b> in the subjacent lamina propria.

Development 105, 787 - 794). To test this hypothesis directly, the mouse homolog, pdx- 1, was cloned and gene targeting was used to produce two separate null alleles. In one, the second pdx- 1 exon, including homeobox sequences, was replaced by a neomycin resistance cassette. In the second, a lacZ reporter was fused in-frame with the N-terminus of PDX- 1, replacing most of the homeodomain. Neonatal pdx- 1 -/- mice for both mutations are apancreatic, in confirmation of the report by Jonsson et al. (Jonsson. J., Carlsson, L., Edlund, T. and Edlund, H. 1994. Nature 371, 606 - 609.). However, the data presented in this dissertation show that the pancreatic buds form in homozygous mutants, with the dorsal bud undergoing limited proliferation and outgrowth to form a small, irregularly branched, ductular tree. No insulin or amylase-positive cells are found in these outgrowths, but glucagon-expressing GLUT 2 -positive cells are found.

40|$|Summary 1. Topical {{application}} of the odorants guaiacol (10 − 3 mol/l, 1 – 30 min) and 2 -isobutyl- 3 -methoxypyrazine (IBMP, 10 − 5 – 10 − 3 mol/l, 15 min) caused time- and concentration-dependent reductions in the secretory granule content of acinar cells of the superficial Bowman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>glands</b> (sBG) and moderate to extensive vacuolation in acinar cells of sBG and deep olfactory glands (dG). 2. Topical {{application of}} 9. 8 mg/ml scopolamine 10 min before 10 − 4 mol/l IBMP significantly reduced the amount of secretory granule depletion from sBG compared to that seen with IBMP alone and resulted in less extensive vacuolation in sBG and dG acinar cells. The i. p. injection of 42 mg/kg propranolol 10 min before topical application of 10 − 4 mol/l IBMP {{had no effect on}} the action of IBMP. 3. Guaiacol and IBMP also had time- and concentration-dependent effects on the secretory activity of sustentacular cells in the olfactory epithelium. The protrusion of secretory material into the mucociliary matrix that covers the epithelial surface and vacuolation within the secretory material resulted from odorant application. Scopolamine and propranolol had no effects on the action of IBMP on sustentacular cell secretory activity. 4. When applied in the vapor phase, guaiacol elicited action potentials recorded from individual olfactory receptor neurons; the impulse frequency was concentration-dependent and showed tonic and phasic components when the duration of stimulation was varied. Low to moderate concentrations of IBMP delivered in the vapor phase evoked monophasic negative slow voltage transients recorded {{from the surface of the}} olfactory mucosa. The amplitudes of these transients increased with increasing stimulus concentrations. Higher concentrations or longer stimulus durations evoked longer-latency positive-voltage generating processes and negative afterpotentials.

40|$|In {{this study}} we describe, {{for the first time}} in spiny lobsters, the {{androgenic}} gland and its putative hormone. The androgenic gland in crustaceans is the key regulator of crustacean masculinity. The transcript encoding the insulin-like androgenic gland specific factor has recently been identified and characterized in a number of decapod crustacean species including commercially important crabs, crayfish, prawns and shrimps. This insulin-like factor has proven to be the androgenic gland masculinizing hormone, and is absent in females. While the androgenic gland and its putative hormone have been identified in all other commercially valuable groups, none had been identified in lobsters.

40|$|Abstract [...] Scentless plant bugs (Heteroptera: Rhopalidae) are {{so named}} because adults of the Serinethinae have vestigial metathoracic <b>s</b> ent <b>glands.</b> Serinethines are seed predators of Sapindales, {{especially}} Sapindaceae that produce toxic cyanolipids. In two serinethine species whose ranges extend into the southern United States, Jadera haematoloma and J. sanguinoIenta, sequestration f host cyanolipids as glucosides renders these gregarious, apo-sematic insects unpalatable {{to a variety of}} predators. The blood glucoside profile and cyanogenesis ofJadera varies depending on the cyanolipid chem-istry of hosts, and adults and larvae fed golden rain tree seeds (Koelreuteria paniculata) excrete the volatile lactone, 4 -methyl- 2 (5 H) -furanone, to which they are attracted. Jadera fed balloon vine seeds (Cardiospermum spp.) do not excrete the attractive lactone. Loss of the usual heteropteran defensive glands in serinethines may have coevolved with host specificity on toxic plants, and the orientation of Jadera to a volatile excretory product could be an adaptive response to save time.

40|$|Lactococcus lactis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} microorganisms in the dairy industry and has "generally recognized as safe" (GRAS) status. L. lactis belongs to the group of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and is encountered in a wide range of environments. Recently, the use of the intramammary infusion of a live culture of LAB has been investigated as a new antibiotic alternative for treating mastitis in dairy ruminants. Controversial results are described in literature regarding its efficacy and safety. In this study we conducted in-depth investigation of the mammary gland immune response induced by intramammary inoculum of a live culture of L. lactis LMG 7930 using the mouse mastitis model. Overnight cultures either of L. lactis (≈ 107 CFU) or of the mastitis pathogens Staphylococcus chromogenes (≈ 105 CFU) or S. aureus (≈ 102 CFU/ml) were injected into the mouse inguinal glands. A double injection, consisting of S. chromogenes first and then L. lactis, was also investigated. Bacterial recovery from the gland and inflammatory cell infiltration were assessed. L. lactis-treated and control glands were analysed for proinflammatory cytokine production. Microbiological results showed that L. lactis was able to survive in the mammary gland 24 h post infection, as were the mastitis pathogens S. chromogenes and S. aureus. L. lactis reduced S. chromogenes survival in the glands and increased its own survival ability by coexisting with the pathogen. Histology showed that L. lactis-treated glands presented variable histological features, ranging from undamaged tissue with no inflammatory cell infiltrate to severe PMN infiltrate with focal areas of tissue damage. <b>S.</b> aureus-treated <b>glands</b> showed the most severe histological grade of inflammation despite the fact that the inoculum size was the smallest. In contrast, most <b>S.</b> chromogenes-treated <b>glands</b> showed normal structures with no infiltration or lesions. Significant increases in IL- 1 β and TNF-α levels were also found in L. lactis-inoculated glands. The above findings seem to suggest that food-grade L. lactis at a high-inoculum dose such as an overnight culture may elicit a suppurative inflammatory response in the mammary gland, thus becoming a potential mastitis-causing pathogen. Because of the unpredictable potential of L. lactis in acting as a potential mastitis pathogen, this organism cannot be considered a safe treatment for bovine mastitis...|$|R

Neurones which innervate the sublingual <b>gland</b> (<b>s.</b> l. neurones) {{are located in the}} thin sheet of tissue which lies between the salivary ducts and the lingual nerve. The existence and characteristics of intrinsic synaptic connexions were studied electrophysiologically in these two divisions of the submandibular ganglion. Three days or more after denervating the ganglion two types of excitatory intrinsic synaptic potentials [...] chemical and electrical [...] were recorded in ganglion cells. Chemical synaptic responses were reversibly blocked by nicotinic antagonists such as hexamethonium (10 microM) and D-tubocurarine (100 microM). Intrinsic chemical synapses were common among s. m. neurones (present in 72 % of neurones) but only 12 % of s. l. neurones were coupled with chemical synapses. Electrical coupling was found among 31 % of s. m. neurones but was not observed between s. l. neurones. Electrotonic coupling in s. m. neurones in denervated and intact ganglia was directly demonstrated by impaling adjacent neurones with separate micro-electrodes. The average coupling ratio for current pulses injected into one cell and recorded in the adjacent cell was 0. 06. During the first 30 days after birth, the number of synaptic inputs from preganglionic (chorda tympani) axons was markedly reduced in both s. m. and s. l. neurones, whereas the incidence of electrical synaptic connexions remained unchanged. The effect of long-term denervation (up to 4 months) on intrinsic synapses was examined. The membrane properties of the parasympathetic neurones and the intrinsic synaptic connexions were maintained without marked changes. It is concluded that the submandibular ganglion in the rat consists of two distinct populations of parasympathetic neurones. The two classes of neurones differ in (1) their location within the ganglion, (2) their target organs and (3) the incidence of intrinsic synapses.

The ultrastructural features of the HPG secretory cycle in workers of S. postica and A. mellifera are alike: granular endoplasmic reticulum well developed, large secretion masses around the intracellular canaliculus in nurse workers and extensive degenerative structures in forager workers. Then {{it is suggested that}} the HPG secrete similar substances in both species. A second secretory cycle seems to occur in early foragers, may be with production of enzymes. The role of the HPGs in queens and males remains unknown but one possibility is enzyme production...|$|R
40|$|Salivary glands from adult blowflies (Calliphora erythrocephala Meigen) {{were studied}} in vitro. The time course {{of changes in}} cyclic AMP content of the glands was {{followed}} at different concentration of 5 -hydroxytryptamine. There was an immediate biphasic rise and fall in cyclic AMP content, following by a slower rise and subsequent gradual decline. The initial rise preceded the onset of fluid secretion by the glands. Rises in cyclic AMP content were inhibited by compound RMI 12330 A (an adenylate cyclase inhibitor) and were halted after about 15 - 20 <b>s</b> if the <b>glands</b> were deprived of Ca 2 +. Theophylline (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) abolished the decline phase of the fast response, Losses of cyclic AMP from the glands either to the bathing medium or to the saliva were small and could {{not account for the}} rapid fall found. Evidence is presented that cyclic GMP is not involved in the process of initiating secretion in the blowfly salivary gland...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Solar-powered sea slugs are {{famed for}} their ability to survive {{starvation}} due to incorporated algal chloroplasts. It is well established that algal-derived carbon can be traced in numerous slug-derived compounds, showing that slugs utilize the photosynthates produced by incorporated plastids. Recently, a new hypothesis suggests that the photosynthates produced are not continuously made available to the slug. Instead, {{at least some of the}} plastid 2 ̆ 019 s photosynthetic products are stored in the plastid itself and only later become available to the slug. The long-term plastid-retaining slug, Elysia timida and its sole food source, Acetabularia acetabulum were examined to determine whether or not starch, a combination of amylose and amylopectin and the main photosynthate produced by A. acetabulum, is produced by the stolen plastids and whether it accumulates within individual kleptoplasts, providing an energy larder, made available to the slug at a later time. Results Histological sections of Elysia timida throughout a starvation period were stained with Lugol 2 ̆ 019 s Iodine solution, a well-known stain for starch granules in plants. We present here for the first time, an increase in amylose concentration, within the slug 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> digestive <b>gland</b> cells during a starvation period, followed by a sharp decrease. Chemically blocking photosynthesis in these tissues resulted in no observable starch, indicating that the starch in untreated animals is a product of photosynthetic activity. Conclusion This suggests that kleptoplasts function as both, a nutritive producer and storage device, holding onto the polysaccharides they produce for a certain time until they are finally available and used by the starving slug to withstand extended starvation periods...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Sebaceous gland tumor of the eyelids {{may arise}} from the meibomian glands, glands of Zeis or glands {{associated}} with the caruncle. They {{are included in the}} list of tumors of the epidermal appendages, so - called adnexal skin structures. Sebaceous gland carcinoma 1 (SGC) might be the second most common lid malignancy after basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Its multifocal origin and pagetoid spread give it a unique place among eyelid malignancies. Sebaceous <b>gland</b> <b>s</b> are located in the periocular skin, caruncle, and eyebrow skin follicles. The tumor is a very rare, slow growing, and commonly found in elderly population with female predisposition. Mean age at diagnosis is mid - sixties; however, the tumor has been repor ted in children as young as 3. 5 years old. It is rare in Caucasians and common in oriental Asiatics. SGC most commonly arises from the meibomian glands 2 anterior to the gray line, occasionally from the glands of Zeis or Moll, and from sebaceous glands in c aruncle 3; however, the cell of origin may not be certain in 50 – 60...|$|R
40|$|The {{respiratory}} epithelium of 8, 12. 5, and 17. 5 -month-old Syrian golden hamsters {{was investigated}} by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) and routine light microscopy (LM) of paraplast sections. In selected cases, SEM-specimens were embedded in Epon after SEM evaluation. The samples were cut in semithin sections and examined by light microscopy. The density of ciliated cells in the respiratory ephithelium differs from hamster to hamster. Care must, therefore, be taken when diagnosing simple metaplasia by SEM alone unless {{a sufficient number of}} damaged cilia are present. Only one animal (8 months old) exhibited squamous metaplasia of the tracheal mucosa. However, surface polymorphism resembling squamous metaplasia was seen in almost every specimen. The polymorphism was caused by either submucosal calcifications or by cystic changes of hyperthropic submucosal glands. In addition, variously formed aggregations of mucus were seen protruding from duct openings of hypertrophic submucosal <b>gland</b> <b>s.</b> To avoid false positive or negative diagnosis which can occur when screening is done by SEM alone, light-microscopical examination of sections cut from SEM identified lesions appears necessary...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{is the first}} to examine a possible link between bacteria and the production of a scent used by birds during mating displays. The arctic seabird, the Crest Auklet, is known for a tangerine-like scent that it produces during breeding season. Birds that produce and use social odors are a new area of study. This project {{is one of the first}} to enumerate bacteria found associated with feathers from sea birds. Other organisms, including humans, produce skin secretions and scents that are modified by commensal bacteria - ones that normally inhabit the body 2 ̆ 7 s surfaces. Some species of bacteria found on the Crested Auklet may have the capacity to convert oils, such as those secreted from the bird 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> preen <b>gland,</b> to compounds resembling those that smell similar to (but are chemically distinct from) tangerines. In contrast, bacteria found on the feathers of a closely related, unscented relative (the Least Auklet) do not have the same metabolic capacities. Domestic chickens also lacked bacteria capable of producing such scent compounds. The method used to identify bacteria involved isolating and identifying signature DNA on bird feathers. Another contribution of the study is the modification and improvement of methods that optimize bacterial DNA extraction from feathers. Extensions of this study in the future will include laboratory cultures that attempt to reconstruct the tangerine scent production from feathers, oil and the associated bacterial species. In addition, studies comparing bacterial profiles from male and female Crested Auklet feather collected at different times of year are planned. Since commensal bacteria have the capacity to chemically modify the components of perfumes and oils, they can be responsible for producing distinct smells on different individuals. Studies that identify the source and social function of feather odors promise to reveal and entirely new mode of bird communication...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of minute blood-vessels in cat 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> adrenal <b>gland</b> has been examined by Ogawa 2 ̆ 7 s method of pigment infusion into blood-vessels. Altogether 26 cats {{were used in}} the experiments. Following are the results obtained : 1) The minute blood-vessels in the internal medulla and external cortex are drained by different circulatory systems : after being drained by the arterioles branching from the arterial network in the capsule, some of the minute blood-vessels in the cortex empty into the venules at its base and, after piercing through the cortex, end in the venous network in the capsule, but majority of them connect with the minute venous network in the medulla and end in the central vein there. Those in the medulla are drained in like manner by the arterioles branching from the arterial network in the capsule and end in the central vein in the medulla. 2) The capillaries in the cortex; which consist of extremely fine vessels, encircle each cellular layer forming a network that has different shapes of meshes: in zona glomerulosa they are dice-shaped, in zona fasciculata rectangular and in zona reticularis irregular polygonal. 3) The specific features observed in the cortex are: a) the transudation of injected mixtures of Chinese ink and Ringer 2 ̆ 7 s solution from the capillaries in zona glomerulosa depends upon the change in the ability of vessel walls to let pass fluid, and b) pronounced contraction of the capillaries is seen in zone fasciculata. 4) It was observed that, in several parts of the medulla which seemed to consist of groups of chromophile cells or ganglionic cells, a capillary network consisted of sinusoid blood-vessels forming diceshaped or rectangular meshes...|$|R

40|$|For {{more than}} a hundred million years, male plethodontid {{salamanders}} have utilized non-volatile, proteinaceous courtship pheromones to regulate female mating receptivity and promote mating success. These pheromones - which are delivered after courtship has commenced and do not act as chemical attractants - are delivered from a male 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> submandibular (mental) <b>gland</b> to the female salamander either by an olfactory mode or transdermally. For approximately 20 years, research on plethodontid courtship pheromones has focused on those involved in olfaction, using the red-legged salamander (Plethodon shermani) as a model. However, the olfactory system is a relatively recent adaptation (20 million years ago) employed only by a single clade of large eastern Plethodon species. In contrast, for the majority of plethodontids (350 / 380 species) the male scratches the back of the female with hypertrophied premaxillary teeth and rubs his gland over the abraded site to transdermally deliver pheromones. Desmognathus ocoee has served as the model for transdermal delivery, however less is known about this species. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the hypothesis that sexual selection has favored unique pheromone composition and structural motifs in different modes of pheromone delivery...|$|R
40|$|Twenty eight {{patients}} of sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism seen {{over a period}} of 10 years were studied. There were 18 females and 10 males {{with a mean age of}} 35. 9 years. Bone involvement was the commonest clinical presentation (90 &#x 0025;) followed by renal involvement (65 &#x 0025;) and more than half the patients (54 &#x 0025;) had involvement of both the skeletal and renal systems. The tumor was clinically palapable in six patients. Thalliumtechnetium subtraction scan had a sensitivity of 87 &#x 0025; followed by computerised tomography (70 &#x 0025;), and ultrasound (65 &#x 0025;) in diagnosing parathyroid pathology.
