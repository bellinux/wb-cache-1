5|$|The company sold $750 {{million in}} assets, {{including}} Fluor's headquarters in Irvine, {{in order to}} pay $1 <b>billion</b> <b>in</b> <b>debt.</b> Staff were reduced from 32,000 to 14,000. In 1986 Fluor sold all of its oil assets and some of its gold mining operations. Fluor Engineers, Inc. and Daniel International were merged, forming Fluor Daniel. By 1987, Fluor had returned to profitability with $26.6 million in profits and $108.5 million by 1989. By the end of the restructuring, Fluor had three major divisions: Fluor Daniel, Fluor Construction International and St. Joe Minerals Corp. Each division had its own smaller subsidiaries. Fluor started being named by Engineering News as the largest construction and engineering company in the United States. Fluor's international revenues rebounded. Having postponed his retirement to help Fluor, Tappan stepped {{down at the end of}} 1989 and was replaced by Leslie McCraw.|$|E

25|$|Like many South Korean {{companies}} with construction interests, Tongyang Group companies were often highly leveraged; Tongyang Inc., for instance, had a debt-to-equity ratio of 12-to-1 in June 2013. The group faced a cash shortage in September 2013, leading to doubts about {{its ability to}} repay debts maturing {{at the end of}} the month; NICE Investors Service estimated that it needed to raise ‚Ç©800 billion to survive. It was reported that the group would issue securities backed by the assets of key subsidiaries, and then liquidate them. On 30 September 2013, Tongyang Group failed to pay back more than ‚Ç©100 <b>billion</b> <b>in</b> <b>debt,</b> and officially filed for court receivership for three of its subsidiaries: Tongyang Corp., Tongyang International, and Tongyang Leisure.

25|$|On May 8, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group‚Äîowner of MyNetworkTV {{affiliate}} WTVZ-TV (channel 33)‚Äîentered into {{an agreement}} to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 <b>billion</b> <b>in</b> <b>debt</b> held by Tribune, pending regulatory approval by the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division. While WTKR is not in conflict with existing FCC in-market ownership rules and would be acquired by Sinclair in any event, the group is precluded from acquiring WGNT directly as broadcasters are not currently allowed to legally own more than two full-power television stations in a single market (both WGNT and WTVZ-TV rank below the ratings threshold that forbids common ownership {{of two of the}} four highest-rated stations by total day viewership in a single market). As such, the companies may be required to sell either WGNT or WTVZ to another broadcasting group in order to comply with FCC ownership rules and alleviate potential antitrust issues preceding approval of the acquisition; however, a sale of either of the two lower-rated stations to an independent buyer is dependent on later decisions by the FCC regarding local ownership of broadcast television stations and future acts by Congress. Alternatively, Sinclair may opt to either take over the operations of WTKR/WGNT or transfer ownership of and retain operational responsibilities for WTVZ-TV through a local marketing agreement with one of its partner companies.|$|E

500|$|Although their {{financial}} position {{was far more}} stable {{by the end of}} 1991, BSkyB accumulated ¬£2 <b>billion</b> <b>in</b> <b>debt</b> and stood to lose ¬£1.5 million per week. To counteract this, the company considered purchasing Thames Television, but Murdoch decided against it because the price was too high. BSkyB therefore was left with three options: offer its subscribers pornography, major films or exclusive sporting events. The first presented itself with [...] "too many problems" [...] and BSkyB for the second were not prepared to renegotiate with the film industry. Sport was seen as the best choice; BSkyB already held rights to cricket and rugby league and assembled talent to present its growing football coverage. Chisholm identified the Premier League as a target, aware that smaller clubs did not favour ITV's coverage. Live rights to top-flight football was moreover unaffordable for the BBC, whose priority was restoring Match of the Day to its traditional spot on Saturday evenings.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the mortal}} {{blow to the}} company derived from Interco's {{response}} to a hostile takeover bid. [...] In 1988, Steven and Mitchell Rales, of the Cardinal Acquisition Corporation, offered $2.5 billion for the company. [...] In response to the offer, Interco's board authorized $1.95 billion in additional debt to buyback stock. [...] Senior management hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to restructure the company, including a plan to sell 16 of Interco's 20 companies. [...] While this restructuring plan successfully avoided the hostile takeover, the company was unable to support its debt payments in the subsequent years. [...] From 1989 to 1991, Interco was forced to divest the totality of its shoe and apparel divisions {{in an attempt to}} remain solvent. [...] While the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation, the full value of these assets was never realized by Interco, as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds. [...] The combination of selling the majority of its companies, while being saddled by over $2 <b>billion</b> <b>in</b> <b>debt,</b> created unsustainable negative cash flow, resulting in Inteco's bankruptcy in 1991. [...] Thus in spite of being a profitable subsidiary, International Hat was liquidated in 1989 in a fire sale to Paramount Cap Company.|$|E
