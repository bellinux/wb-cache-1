5|$|From 1929 to 1974, the Scarborough Engine Company of the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department had {{its first}} firehouse in the church's garage {{building}} or barn, which {{is older than}} the church <b>building</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Batman Begins, the Board of Trade Building {{represents}} {{the headquarters of}} Wayne Enterprises, but in the 2008 sequel, The Dark Knight, Wayne Enterprises was represented by the Richard J. Daley Center. The <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> appears in The Dark Knight.|$|E
5|$|Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport {{was closed}} {{before the storm}} but {{reported}} no flooding in airplane movement areas or inside of the <b>building</b> <b>itself.</b> By August 30, it was reopened to humanitarian and rescue operations. Commercial cargo flights resumed on September 10, and commercial passenger service resumed on September 13.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, there were {{relatively}} few accidents and {{deaths in the}} <b>building</b> programme <b>itself,</b> but many slave labourers died of starvation.|$|R
5000|$|On 24 November 2006, Michael Stone (loyalist {{paramilitary}} {{member from}} the Braniel estate in Belfast, Northern Ireland)was arrested for breaking into Stormont with an imitation handgun and a knife, and scrawling graffiti on Parliament <b>Buildings</b> <b>itself.</b> Initial news reports {{indicated that he}} may have been carrying a [...] "suspect device". Later, between six and eight pipe bombs were defused by the Army. The resumption of talks about power sharing and electing a First Minister between the parties at Stormont, which had only just resumed, had to be abandoned.|$|R
50|$|A fire on July 23, 1973, killed 4 {{people and}} injured 63, {{destroying}} {{the contents of}} several floors inside the building. There was no major damage to the <b>building</b> structure <b>itself.</b>|$|R
5|$|Structure 5 (or Structure V) {{is a large}} {{building}} {{located on}} the plaza {{to the north of}} Structure 2. It was surrounded by 10 stelae, many dated to the 7th century AD although the <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> was first erected in the Preclassic period.|$|E
5|$|The Cunard Building's {{architectural}} style can be generally {{described as a}} mix of Italian Renaissance and Greek Revival, {{with a degree of}} Beaux-Arts influence on the building's structural form. Willink and Caldwell's designs were heavily influenced by the work of Italian architect Baldassare Peruzzi and more broadly Italian Renaissance palace design in general, with the Farnese Palace in Rome believed to have been particularly influential. Despite the strong Italian influence, the architects chose to introduce Greek style for the details around the <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> and, as the <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> is larger than the Italian palaces that provided its inspiration, its structural form was prominently based upon American Beaux-Arts buildings such as those in New York.|$|E
5|$|The <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> {{is based}} around a {{striking}} honeycomb frontage, modelled on close-up images of an insect's eye, and is illuminated {{at night in}} a variety of colours that reflect the mood of whichever show is playing at the time.|$|E
50|$|Wilmslow Methodist Church {{occupies}} a modern building {{close to the}} town centre, replacing an 1886 <b>building</b> which <b>itself</b> replaced the original 1798 church, built just 7 years after John Wesley's death.|$|R
50|$|Option B {{included}} Roosevelt {{moving to}} a larger <b>building</b> by <b>itself</b> while keeping Nokomis at its current location or moving it separately. In this plan, the new building would be 10000 sq ft.|$|R
50|$|The present Romanesque church {{stands on}} the site of several older cathedral <b>buildings,</b> but <b>itself</b> dates from the 12th-13th centuries. Construction started in 1176 and the cathedral was consecrated on 22 October 1246.|$|R
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Terminal 4, all stations in the airport are freestanding structures, connected to their respective terminal buildings by an aerial walkway. Terminal 4 opened in 2013 with the station inside the terminal <b>building</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 16–17 April 1941, {{in one of the}} last major air raids on London, bombs {{repeatedly}} fell on the Waterloo area, and the LNC's good fortune in avoiding damage to their facilities finally ran out. In {{the early stages of the}} air raid the rolling stock stored in the Necropolis siding was burned, and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was damaged, although the terminal <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> remained unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the pattern}} of Hawaiian volcano formation, Kīlauea started as a {{submarine}} volcano, gradually <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> up through underwater eruptions of alkali basalt lava before emerging from the sea {{with a series of}} explosive eruptions about 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. Since then, the volcano's activity has likely been as it is now, a continual stream of effusive and explosive eruptions of roughly the same pattern as its activity in the last 200 or 300 years.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a church}} in the village {{dedicated}} to St Margaret built in 1897. This had replaced a 1732 <b>building</b> that <b>itself</b> had replaced the earlier medieval church. The church is Grade II listed building.|$|R
50|$|The {{separate}} {{name for}} the archive is no longer given prominence in RCAHMS corporate publications. The NMRS was created when the Scottish National <b>Buildings</b> Record (<b>itself</b> founded in 1942) {{was transferred to the}} RCAHMS in 1966.|$|R
5000|$|Nanshi Cuisine Street {{is located}} in Nanshi, the busiest section of the city's {{downtown}} area of Tianjin, China. It is a national, classic and palatial architectural complex. Nanshi Cuisine Street looks like an ancient walled city enclosed by a circle of neat three-story buildings. There is a crossroad in the [...] "city," [...] and at {{the centre of the}} crossroad is a musical fountain. The entire structure is covered with a glass roof. Even not tasting anything, one could be attracted by the <b>buildings</b> <b>itself,</b> which carry a kind of classical ethnic beauty. The green glazed roof tile, colored vivid pattern compel the admiration.|$|R
5|$|The {{sandstone}} <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> {{dates back}} to the 1720s. It was purchased by Reid and Long in 1962 who initially operated the premises as a tea room. The restaurant gained two Michelin stars in 1977; that year's list was the first with two star restaurants in the UK (the others were The Waterside Inn, Le Gavroche and The Connaught).|$|E
5|$|Union Station is an Amtrak {{railroad}} station and mixed-use commercial building in downtown Erie, in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The Lake Shore Limited provides passenger service between Chicago, New York City, and Boston; Erie is the train's only stop in Pennsylvania. The station's ground floor has been redeveloped into commercial spaces, including The Brewerie at Union Station, a brewpub. The <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> is privately {{owned by the}} global logistics and freight management company Logistics Plus and serves as its headquarters.|$|E
5|$|After being decommissioned, Coalhouse Fort was leased {{and used}} as a storage {{facility}} by Bata Shoes, which operated the nearby Bata shoe factory in East Tilbury. It was also used for a while for emergency housing for demobilised servicemen and their families. In 1959, the parade ground {{was used as a}} coal store during a miners' strike. Thurrock Urban District Council (now Thurrock Council) purchased the fort in 1962 and still own it. The council turned the area around the fort into a riverside park but the <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> decayed badly through neglect and vandalism.|$|E
50|$|The factory has {{occupied}} {{its present}} site, {{not far from}} Atocha station, since the nineteenth century. The nineteenth century <b>building</b> is <b>itself</b> is of historical interest. It was given a heritage listing Bien de Interés Cultural in 2006.|$|R
5000|$|The six-storey north wing of {{the hotel}} facing the {{waterfront}} opened in 1893. It replaced the Melcher's <b>Building,</b> which <b>itself</b> was formerly owned by Dent & Co., where the west wing of its [...] "princely hong" [...] headquarters was located.|$|R

5|$|During the Second World War Waterloo {{station and}} the nearby Thames bridges were a {{significant}} target for Axis bombing, and there were several near-misses on the station during the London Blitz of 1940–41. Although there were several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line, the Necropolis station was undamaged {{during the early stages}} of the bombing campaign. During the night of 16–17 April 1941, in one of the last major air raids on London, bombs repeatedly fell on the Waterloo area. The rolling stock berthed in the Necropolis siding was burned, and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was damaged, but the terminal <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> remained unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the pattern}} of Hawaiian volcano formation, Mauna Loa would have started as a {{submarine}} volcano, gradually <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> up through underwater eruptions of alkali basalt before emerging from the sea {{through a series of}} surtseyan eruptions about 400,000 years ago. Since then, the volcano has remained active, with a history of effusive and explosive eruptions, including 33 eruptions since the first well-documented eruption in 1843. Although Mauna Loa's activity has been overshadowed in recent years by that of its neighbor Kīlauea, it remains active.|$|E
5|$|In the African American {{section of}} the city, where most {{dwellings}} were built of discarded material, many homes were damaged. On one street, only two houses did not lose either their walls or roof. Walls and cars were cartwheeling down the streets. During the storm, about 100people ran to a trash incinerator, a concrete-reinforced building. A few of the local Black churches suffered significant damage. Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church lost many bricks on its front facade {{and much of the}} metal grillwork around the entrances, while the <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> was deroofed. Payne Chapel AME Church, then located at Banyan Boulevard and Tamarind Avenue, was destroyed by the storm. St. Patrick's Catholic Church received about $40,000 in damage.|$|E
50|$|All of the <b>buildings</b> in Avongrove <b>itself</b> are {{privately owned}} houses, with the {{exception}} of a petrol station.|$|R
50|$|Today the {{community}} of Mömlingen, which since the Second World War has undergone great growth through <b>building,</b> presents <b>itself</b> as a lower centre that has at its disposal a colourful pallet of not-for-profit institutions, and whose scenically charming location is treasured by many visitors.|$|R
50|$|The <b>building</b> {{stands by}} <b>itself</b> {{in the middle}} of the {{vineyards}} along the river Neckar making it visible from afar.|$|R
5|$|The Cunard War Memorial {{is located}} {{on the west side of}} the Cunard Building and was erected in memory of the Cunard {{employees}} who were killed during the First World War, and later the Second World War. A Grade II listed monument, it was designed by Arthur Davis, who acted as consultant during the construction of the Cunard <b>Building</b> <b>itself.</b> It was erected around 1920, although it wasn't officially unveiled until 1921, by the Earl of Derby, Edward Stanley. Prior to being located at the Pier Head, the monument had been exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in London.|$|E
5|$|The Fakahani Mosque exemplifies this process. It {{was built}} in the Fatimid period, either as a {{suspended}} mosque (one with shops underneath it) or with a high basement. After the earthquake of 1302 it was rebuilt. In 1440 an ablution basin was added, and early in the Ottoman period a minaret was built. The amir Ahmad Katkhuda Mustahfazan al-Kharbutli in 1735 ordered a major reconstruction, almost all of the original building being replaced apart from two doors. These finely carved doors were registered as a historical monument in 1908 by the committee of conservation, and the <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> was registered in 1937.|$|E
5|$|The incongruous make-up {{between the}} Western lower half and Thai roof has been {{compared}} with a Farang (Western) lady clothed in Victorian costume while wearing a Thai crown. The symbolism of this juxtaposition is the emphasis of the superiority of Thai architecture (as a crown upon the head) over those of the West (the {{lower half of the}} body). This stylistic innovation was more than an artistic coincidence, as it was supposed to convey a significant political message of Siamese resistance over Western imperialism, both of sovereignty and style. From another perspective, the <b>building</b> <b>itself</b> epitomizes the internal political struggle between the ideas of Westernization and modernity (led by King Rama V) against those of the traditional ruling elites (as led by some of his early ministers).|$|E
50|$|CKON-FM {{went on the}} air on October 1, 1984. The station's {{studios are}} located in the Akwesasne Communication Society Building; that <b>building</b> is <b>itself</b> {{on both sides of the}} {{international}} border, with part of it being in Hogansburg, New York, and part of it in Saint Regis, Quebec.|$|R
50|$|Until their {{abolition}} in 1312, the Templar Knights {{were linked}} to the castle. The Templars owned the Monastery of San Bevignate. The rumors and {{the proximity of the}} church to the castle make us think that catholic pilgrims received hospitality in that <b>building,</b> being <b>itself</b> submitted to the Order.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, LVN Pictures {{also decided}} to close its {{post-production}} facilities at the old studio lot, which was now almost decrepit due to forty years of non-film production. The reason for LVN Pictures final closure was the lessening number of Filipino films that availed of their post-production services. Indeed, the Philippine film industry was already slumping to 53 films a year. The costs of maintaining the equipment at the LVN Studios exceeded the revenue that it received from post-production, so on June 30, 2005, LVN's post-production equipment went up for sale and was bought by an unnamed group of businessmen. Nevertheless, the LVN Museum, the lot and the studio <b>buildings</b> <b>itself</b> {{were not part of}} the buy-out. At the time of the purchase, the whole LVN Pictures was valued at P45 million.|$|R
