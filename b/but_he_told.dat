5|$|After Roosevelt's {{death and}} Truman's {{succession}} to the Presidency, Minton continued offering {{advice to the}} new administration {{on a range of}} topics, including patronage and political maneuvering. Truman appointed Minton as head of the War Department Clemency Board, a panel of judges charged with overseeing reviews of decisions made by the courts-martial. The panel met every two weeks which, along with his responsibilities on the circuit court, kept Minton very busy and afforded him little rest, leading to a deterioration in his health. While yachting with President Truman on Memorial Day in 1945, Truman asked Minton to accept an appointment to the position of Solicitor General of the United States. Minton declined because of his health, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Truman he would be interested in a seat on the Supreme Court.|$|E

[...] The {{first thing he did}} was join the Territorial Army for six months. Although he enjoyed his time in the TA, Dickinson {{realised}} {{that it was not a}} career choice, and so he applied for a place to read history at Queen Mary College, London.

To commence filming, Tracy had to be insured for the high premium of $71,000; Hepburn and Kramer both put their salaries in escrow until Tracy completed his scenes.

500|$|The “biggest” of {{the four}} soldiers, Sam {{is known for his}} child-like personality. He befriends a young Italian boy, Angelo Torancelli, and becomes a father figure to the child. Sam is first to {{discover}} a finely carved statue head, the Head of the Primavera, which he believes to carry magical powers. Miller was a fan of McBride's novel prior to learning of the film adaptation by Lee. He fought hard to win the role of Sam, which resulted in him physically preparing for the part: “My physical prep was a little different than everybody else’s, because Spike wanted me for the movie, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> me I had to lose weight to do it. I had nine weeks to lose 60 pounds. We got it done.” ...|$|E

A former Suffolk county councillor, {{she worked as}} an administrator at the Marie Curie Hospital in London and was well known in senior Labour circles; she had met Driberg in 1949, at a weekend party given by the government minister George Strauss. According to her son, she was fully aware of Driberg's sexual preferences, but looked forward to some political excitement, and [...] "thought they could do a useful job as Mr. and Mrs." [...] Driberg's motives are less clear, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> his friend John Freeman that he needed someone to run Bradwell Lodge, {{to which he had}} returned in 1946 after its release by the RAF.|$|E
500|$|Yarborough, Boucherett's patron, was an {{opponent}} of the administration of William Pitt the Younger and supported the Duke of Portland during the 1790s. Boucherett was an infrequent voter, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> the diarist Joseph Farington that, when he did vote, he tended to do so with Charles James Fox, rather than Pitt the Younger, although, he later became [...] "disgusted" [...] at Fox's style of opposition; he is also known to have voted against the Ferrol Expedition in 1801. The seat did allow for him to further {{the interests of the}} Haven Company, with him proposing a bill to grant more funds in 1799. He found, though, that his funds and the financial success of the company were both in decline by 1801. Although re-elected in 1802, the following year he resigned in favour of Lord Yarborough's eldest son and heir, the Hon. Charles Anderson Pelham, later 1st Earl and 2nd Baron Yarborough.).|$|E
500|$|The High Court was {{convened in}} the Supreme Court Building on 25March 1983.

[...] Knight continued to build his case on the evidence gathered by detective work. [...] Photographs of the crime scenes, together with witness testimonies, would help the court to visualise the events that led to the crimes. Other evidencethe blood samples, religious objects, drugs, and the notes with Ng and Ghazali's namesconclusively proved the defendants' involvement. [...] Knight had no eyewitnesses to the murders; his evidence was circumstantial, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> the court in his opening statement, [...] "What matters is that [...] did intentionally suffocate and drown these two innocent children, causing their deaths in circumstances which amount to murder.

500|$|For {{the first}} three years of his life, Bundy lived in the Philadelphia home of his {{maternal}} grandparents, Samuel and Eleanor Cowell, who raised him as their son to avoid the social stigma that accompanied birth outside wedlock at the time. Family, friends, and even young Ted were told that his grandparents were his parents and that his mother was his older sister. Eventually he discovered the truth, though his recollection of the circumstances varied. He told a girlfriend that a cousin showed him a copy of his birth certificate after calling him a [...] "bastard", <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> biographers Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth that he found the certificate himself. Biographer and true crime writer Ann Rule, who knew Bundy personally, believes that he did not find out until 1969, when he located his original birth record in Vermont. Bundy expressed a lifelong resentment toward his mother for never talking to him about his real father, and for leaving him to discover his true parentage for himself.|$|E
500|$|The huge {{crowds that}} Harrison's {{campaign}} events attracted were unprecedented, though Jackson's campaigns {{for the presidency}} had seen rallies on a smaller scale. These gatherings both promoted the Whig ticket and were themselves entertainment for the participants, thus attracting even more attendees; as New York Governor William H. Seward, a Whig, put it, [...] "nothing attracts a crowd so rapidly as the knowledge {{that there is a}} crowd already." [...] The Democrats were shocked by the outpouring of support, with Pennsylvania Senator James Buchanan noting that the people had [...] "abandoned their ordinary business for the purpose of electioneering". As the log cabin theme took hold, alternative nicknames for Harrison such as [...] "Old Buckeye" [...] were dropped, and Whigs, heretofore more associated with the wealthier classes, sought to appeal to the humbly-born. Senator Webster, in his speeches, regretted that he was not born in a log cabin (though his older siblings were), <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> of annual pilgrimages to the old cabin with his children to instill its values in them.|$|E
500|$|After the {{publication}} of this letter, Bernard Becker, special correspondent of the Daily News, traveled to Ireland to cover Boycott's situation. On 24October, he wrote a dispatch from Westport that contained an interview with Boycott. He reported that Boycott had £500 worth of crops that would rot if help {{could not be found}} to harvest them. According to Becker, [...] "Personally he is protected, but no woman in Ballinrobe would dream of washing him a cravat or making him a loaf. All the people have to say is that they are sorry, but that they 'dare not. Boycott had been advised to leave, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Becker that [...] "I can hardly desert Lord Erne, and, moreover, my own property is sunk in this place." [...] Becker's report was reprinted in the Belfast News-Letter and the Dublin Daily Express. On 29October, the Dublin Daily Express published a letter proposing a fund to finance a party of men to go to County Mayo to save Boycott's crops. Between them, the Daily Express, Daily Telegraph, Daily News, and News Letter raised £2,000 to fund the relief expedition.|$|E

500|$|Mrs. Puff's {{development}} {{originated with}} {{a request by}} Nickelodeon that SpongeBob attend a school. Nickelodeon initially wanted to make SpongeBob a child since their most successful cartoons at the time focused on young, school-age characters. Hillenburg stated that the network wanted SpongeBob to be like [...] "Arnold [...] under the sea," [...] <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> them, [...] "No, that's not the show." [...] As a compromise, Hillenburg decided to [...] "put him in school - {{but it would be}} a [...] driving school"; this allowed him to keep writing SpongeBob as an adult while also using the school as a main plot element. Showrunner Vincent Waller suggested that if the network had creative control over the show, almost every episode would take place at Mrs. Puff's school, not at a variety of locations. The choice to make Mrs. Puff a blowfish, who inflates into a ball when SpongeBob crashes, was made to evoke the appearance of car airbags. Because she was created late in production, her design incorporates elements of the earlier characters' appearances, such as the same type of skirt as Pearl and the same rounded teeth as Squidward.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 15 November, Pedro II was in Petrópolis when he {{received}} the first telegram from Ouro Preto informing him of the rebellion. However, he did not assign much import to the news. At 11a.m. as he left a mass {{in honor of the}} 45th anniversary of his sister Maria II's death, the monarch received a second telegram and decided to return to Rio de Janeiro. His wife expressed concern, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> her, [...] "On what ma'am? When I arrive there it will be over!" [...] He travelled by train, reading periodicals and scientific magazines. Not imagining the gravity of the situation, he arrived at the city palace at 3p.m. André Rebouças suggested that he go to the countryside to organize resistance. The Marquis of Tamandaré asked for his permission to lead the Armada (navy) and suppress the rebellion. He dismissed all the ideas put forward and said, [...] "This is nothing. I know my countrymen." [...] The Emperor asked the Conservative senator Manuel Francisco Correia what he thought of the situation. Correia answered that he believed that {{it was the end of}} the monarchy. Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the possibility.|$|E
500|$|Jill begins {{an affair}} with wealthy Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) and was {{convinced}} he would ask her to marry him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> her {{it was just a}} fling. Mortified, she quickly remarried John, much to the dismay of his children. Jill wanted another child, but John felt he was too old. She quickly got pregnant before he had a secret vasectomy. He wanted her to have an abortion but she didn't, and gave birth to Billy Abbott (Billy Miller). John and Jill continuously had arguments and she had {{an affair with}} Jed Sanders. Mamie found out and told John, ending the marriage. They had a bitter custody battle, but John suffered another stroke. Mamie confessed her love to John; Jill then paid her millions to leave town. John gained custody of Billy and left for New York. Later, Jill found a letter from Phillip Chancellor II which named her the sole owner of the Chancellor Estate; she evicted Katherine. Katherine found a legal loophole, allowing her to stay on the estate. Billy Abbott and Brock Reynold's teenage daughter MacKenzie Browning began a romance. [...] Jill had a brief romance with a young web designer, Sean Bridges (David Lee Russek). Katherine allowed ex-con Larry Warton (Shark Fralick) to move in for housework, and Jill had an affair with him but kept it secret because of his social class. Katherine found out and confronted Jill, who denied it. Jill even insulted Larry, causing him to show up at a Jabot board meeting and expose the affair.|$|E

500|$|Authorities in the Atlanta area {{discovered}} Cox's activities, {{and eventually}} his identity. On August 6, 2004, the United States Secret Service issued arrest warrants for Cox, alleging conspiracy, identity theft, mail and wire fraud, money laundering, {{and social security}} number fraud. News broadcasts showed photos of Cox and Hauck and requested that viewers provide any information pertaining to their whereabouts. By spring 2005, the couple had eluded authorities for eighteen months, using dozens of identities, including ones stolen from former co-workers and acquaintances. Cox also stole identities from the homeless by posing as a survey–taking Red Cross worker to acquire their social security numbers. At this point, due to remorse and anxiety, Arnold called the FBI and confessed. She was sentenced {{to two years in}} prison for numerous offenses, including conspiracy to commit bank fraud and identity theft. Arnold was also ordered to pay $300,000 dollars in restitution to her victims. Shortly thereafter, Cox filed multiple mortgages on two houses for $886,318 in Columbia, South Carolina in less than a week. An abstractor noticed this, and a fraud alert was issued on one of Cox's money-laundering bank accounts. He was arrested {{when he returned to the}} bank to make a transaction, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> authorities his name was [...] "Gary Lee Sullivan", one of about thirty aliases Cox had at the time; because [...] "Sullivan" [...] had no open warrants, the police released him. Shortly afterwards, Cox and Hauck moved to Houston, but they separated and she remained there in hiding under an assumed name. A year later the Secret Service found Hauck and arrested her. Convicted on numerous counts, Hauck was sentenced to six years in prison, and five years of supervised release. In May 2006, after being on the run from authorities for two and a half years, Cox was placed on the Secret Service's Most Wanted Fugitives List.|$|E
