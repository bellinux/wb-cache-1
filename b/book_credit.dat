50|$|Colonists {{relied on}} {{international}} funds, primarily from England, for their early development. Majority of this overseas credit {{was in the}} form of a mercantile credit. The English merchants, for example, would ship goods to the American Colonies and demand payments only after six months or a year. These overseas loans where available to colonists who developed close ties to English merchants. The overseas credit allowed colonists to develop a system of domestic credit. The domestic credit was administered in two forms: <b>book</b> <b>credit</b> and promissory notes. Promissory notes are very similar to bonds, because they detailed the amount of debt, date of issue, date of redemption, form or repayment and an interest rate. Because of these characteristics, promissory notes could be traded and they were considered a less risky for of a loan to issuers.|$|E

Her husband credits her with the original idea for Arak, Son of Thunder, noting, [...] "Danette Couto (soon to be Dann Thomas) had this idea: What if a Native American had discovered Europe?" [...] She began co-writing the Arak title with issue #12 (Aug. 1982) and would work with Thomas on most of his projects afterwards. Roy Thomas explained in 2011 that [...] "Dann and I co-wrote Infinity from the beginning, coplotting it, with Dann usually, if not always, doing the first draft on the script, which I then rewrote. Not that she was openly credited as co-writer right away; I had to take it slow in that area." [...] Dann Thomas co-wrote Wonder Woman #300 (Feb. 1983) and, as Roy Thomas noted in 1999 [...] "became the first woman ever to receive scripting credit on the world's foremost super-heroine." [...] A rare example of Dann Thomas' solo writing appeared in the Wally Wood's T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents series published by Deluxe Comics.|$|E
40|$|Account books {{show that}} merchants {{frequently}} used <b>book</b> <b>credit</b> in exchanges with consumers. The ability {{of credit to}} act as a substitute for currency in payments depends on the terms attached to the credit, such as its duration.

Given the expected duration, <b>book</b> <b>credit</b> seems a good substitute for other forms of payment.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the eighteenth}} century, {{merchant}} financial accounting, especially double-entry accounting, {{should be of}} interest, and not only to accounting historians. The many account books left by traders the world over show how credit structured the early modern economy and society.
