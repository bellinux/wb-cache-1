5|$|UNITA's {{ability to}} mine {{diamonds}} {{and sell them}} abroad provided funding for the war to continue even as the movement's support in the Western world and among the local populace withered away. De Beers and Endiama, a state-owned diamond-mining monopoly, signed a contract allowing De Beers to handle Angola's diamond exports in 1990. According to the United Nation's Fowler Report, Joe De Deker, a former stockholder in De Beers, worked {{with the government of}} Zaire to supply military equipment to UNITA from 1993 to 1997. De Deker's brother, Ronnie, allegedly flew from South Africa to Angola, directing weapons originating in Eastern Europe. In return, UNITA gave Ronnie bushels of diamonds worth $6million. De Deker sent the diamonds to De Beer's <b>buying</b> <b>office</b> in Antwerp, Belgium. De Beers openly acknowledges spending $500million on legal and illegal Angolan diamonds in 1992 alone. The United Nations estimates Angolans made between three and four billion dollars through the diamond trade between 1992 and 1998. The UN also estimates that out of that sum, UNITA made at least $3.72billion, or 93% of all diamond sales, despite international sanctions.|$|E

40|$|One {{answer to}} the {{question}} of why government organizations don't perform better-common in academic “public choice” literature but also in folk wisdom-is that resources come too easily, independent of performance. Some businessmanagement literature suggests that a crisis in resource flows can force successful change-”necessity is the mother of invention. ” However, the literature also presents an alternative view: that crisis promotes rigid preprogrammed responses, not new ways of behaving. This paper examines the impact of crisis on organizational change in government by examining an organizational change effort in the U. S. federal government (procurement reform during the 1990 s) that occurred simultaneously with an organizational crisis involving workforce downsizing and introduction of competition for some <b>buying</b> <b>offices.</b> Using a dataset consisting of a survey of approximately 1, 600 frontline government contracting officials, the impact of variation in crisis at different <b>buying</b> <b>offices</b> on variation in behavior change is examined. Necessity was found to be the mother of invention, not rigidity. However, these effects were counteracted by two negative effects of crisis on organizational change: 1) employee resentment over violation of a “social contract at work” reduced behavior change, 2) employee association of the change effort with downsizing reduced attitudinal support for the change, which translated into reduced behavior change. On balance, crisis inhibited organizational change, rather than promoting it. Â© 2006 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management...|$|R
