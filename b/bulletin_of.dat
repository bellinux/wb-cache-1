5|$|After the war {{he became}} a {{champion}} of nuclear nonproliferation.

He published papers on cosmic rays, and a 1958 paper of his is considered to mark the birth of gamma ray astronomy. He was also known for writing popular science books and articles, and appearing in television programs.|$|E

5|$|The mouse {{was first}} {{described}} by Frank Chapman in 1889 {{in a paper}} in the <b>Bulletin</b> <b>of</b> the American Museum of Natural History, from a specimen collected at Gainesville, Florida.

5|$|The names at {{that point}} {{remained}} unofficial, but in 2016 the IAU organised a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardise proper names for stars.
