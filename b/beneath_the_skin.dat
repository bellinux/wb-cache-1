5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) takes a {{pregnant}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{to the hospital}} when she doubles over in pain. There, Reyes phones him {{to ask about the}} case, but Mulder cedes to the authority of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), who is formally running the X-Files. However, Reyes says she can't call Doggett since it is about him. Meanwhile, Jeb is in a hotel room in Georgia trying to shoot himself in the head. Suddenly, he notices something wrong with his face; he claws at his face, peeling away the skin to reveal burning embers <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
60|$|We hid our {{new weapons}} <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> which formed our beds, and then Perry {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} making bows and arrows--weapons apparently unknown within Pellucidar. Next came shields; but these I found it easier to steal from the walls of the outer guardroom of the building.|$|R

50|$|Urushiol is {{primarily}} {{found in the}} spaces between cells <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>skin</b> of <b>the</b> plant, so the effects are less severe if the plant tissue remains undamaged on contact. Once the oil and resin are thoroughly washed from <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> <b>the</b> rash is not contagious. Urushiol does not always spread once it has bonded with <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> and cannot be transferred once the urushiol has been washed away.|$|R
5|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce analgesia. First, the leads are implanted, guided by fluoroscopy and feedback from the patient, and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> of the upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they {{are attached to the}} snugly fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of cancer pain.|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is when gas or air is in {{the layer}} under the skin. Subcutaneous refers to the tissue <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> and emphysema refers to trapped air. It is sometimes abbreviated SCE or SE and also called tissue emphysema, or Sub Q air. Since the air generally comes from the chest cavity, subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where {{it is able to}} travel from the chest cavity along the fascia. Subcutaneous emphysema has a characteristic crackling feel to the touch, a sensation that has been described as similar to touching Rice Krispies; this sensation of air under the skin is known as subcutaneous crepitation.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the finless sleeper ray is oval in shape; it is slightly wider than long in adults, and circular or longer than wide in juveniles. The small and bulging eyes are immediately followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles of roughly equal size. A pair of kidney-shaped electric organs are visible <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> {{on either side}} of the head. A curtain of skin, reaching the mouth, is present between the small, circular nostrils. The nostrils are connected to the corners of the mouth by a pair of grooves. The small mouth is gently arched and protrusible. The flattened teeth have hexagonal bases and are arranged into narrow bands. There are five pairs of short gill slits.|$|E

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the onefin electric ray is wider than long and almost circular in shape. The two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> {{on either side}} of the head. The eyes are small and protruding; the larger spiracles lie closely behind and have three small finger-like projections on their rims. The nostrils are placed rather close together, and between them is a long skirt-like flap of skin that reaches the mouth. The small and protrusible mouth is nearly straight and surrounded by prominent furrows. The teeth are tiny and pointed. There are five pairs of small gill slits on the underside of the disc.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{are very}} large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook {{at the end}} of the upper mandible, and the {{attachment}} of a huge gular pouch to the lower. The slender rami of the lower bill and the flexible tongue muscles form the pouch into a basket for catching fish and, sometimes, rainwater, though in order not to hinder the swallowing of large fish, the tongue itself is tiny. They have a long neck and short stout legs with large, fully webbed feet. Although they are among the heaviest of flying birds, they are relatively light for their apparent bulk because of air pockets in the skeleton and <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> enabling them to float high in the water. The tail is short and square. The wings are long and broad, suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight, and have the unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary flight feathers.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray has a soft, flabby body devoid of dermal denticles. It has an oval pectoral fin disc about 1.2 times {{as wide as}} long, with a nearly straight front margin {{and a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs visible <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> The eyes are small and followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles; the space from the spiracles to the snout tip is about 1.8 times the distance between the spiracles. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils that almost reaches the mouth, which is arched with deep furrows at the corners. The distance between the mouth and the snout tip is about equal to the mouth width, and three times that of the distance between the nostrils. There are 25–28 upper tooth rows and 19–26 lower tooth rows; each tooth is tiny and smooth, with a single sharp cusp.|$|E

25|$|Occasionally, when a {{blood vessel}} is {{punctured}} during the tattooing procedure a hematoma (bruise) may appear. Bruises generally heal within one week. Bruises can appear as halos around a tattoo, or, if blood pools, as one larger bruise. This bluish or dark blurry halo that surrounds a tattoo {{can also be}} attributed to ink diffusion or 'blow-out'. Commonly mistaken for a hematoma, this discolouration occurs when tattoo pigments spread out into <b>the</b> subcutaneous tissue <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> dermal <b>skin</b> layer, and {{may be caused by}} ink being deposited too deep in <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|R
40|$|The inverted-T skin-reducing mastectomy with implant {{reconstruction}} {{represents a}} very effective reconstructive and cosmetic option in patients with macromastia. However, in this subset of patients, <b>the</b> risk of <b>skin</b> flap necrosis, especially at the T-junction, is significant. In this setting, complete implant coverage with viable tissue <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> mastectomy <b>skin</b> flaps is essential to reduce morbidity. In this article, the authors retrospectively review their series of 16 skin-reducing mastectomy and immediate one-stage implant reconstructions using the submuscular-subfascial pocket, analyzing the reconstructive issues and cosmetic outcomes...|$|R
25|$|In many catfish, the humeral {{process is}} a bony process {{extending}} backward from the pectoral girdle immediately above {{the base of the}} pectoral fin. It lies <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> where its outline may be determined by dissecting the skin or probing with a needle.|$|E
25|$|Photosensitivity is an {{abnormal}} skin reaction to direct sunlight exposure. It is unrelated to a sunburn. These reactions {{are due to}} photosensitization, the accumulation of photosensitive compounds <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> In some cases, the photodynamic substances come from ingested plants or drugs, after being metabolized or not. In other cases, the photodynamic substances may be produced in the body itself due to inborn errors in pigment metabolism, especially those involving the heme synthesis. Photosensitivity reactions are usually seen in herbivorous or omnivorous animals, though such reactions are not uncommon among carnivores.|$|E
25|$|Building on Aston Martin's {{established}} {{road car}} and sports racer template, the chassis of the DBR4 was a conventional spaceframe structure, skinned with aluminium bodywork. <b>Beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> the DBR4's basic design was {{closely related to}} the DB3S sports car of 1956, but with its ancillary components more tightly packaged to enclose them in the smaller, single-seater body. Although some manufacturers had started to use wind-tunnel testing for racing cars, such as the Bristol 450, aerodynamics as a science was still in its infancy where road vehicles were concerned. As a result of this, although the DBR4's bodywork appeared svelte and streamlined, the effect was ruined by the decision to mount a large air intake {{on the side of the}} bonnet, and to install a relatively tall, near-vertical windscreen.|$|E
50|$|Many fresh chilies such as poblano {{have a tough}} {{outer skin}} that does not break down on cooking. Chilies are {{sometimes}} used whole or in large slices, by roasting, or other means of blistering or charring <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> {{so as not to}} entirely cook <b>the</b> flesh <b>beneath.</b> When cooled, <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> will usually slip off easily.|$|R
40|$|A case {{of large}} diverticular stone of {{anterior}} urethra is reported. A 70 -year-old man was admitted for dysuria, miction pain and hard mass <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> scrotal <b>skin.</b> Retrograde urethrogram revealed a large stone in anterior urethral diverticulum and extravasation of contrast medium through the fistula from diverticulum. Open resection of diverticulum was performed {{and the stone}} was removed. Three months after the operation, the urethrogram showed no abnormal findings. The stone was 40 x 19 x 17 mm in size, weighed 16 g and was mainly composed of calcium phosphate...|$|R
5000|$|The Butler's frogfish has unusually {{long and}} [...] "arm-like" [...] {{pectoral}} fin lobes, which unlike other frogfish are largely {{detached from the}} sides of the body. Its genus name Tathicarpus, meaning [...] "extending wrist", refers to this trait. The fish uses these pectoral fins to clamber along the sea bottom. The number of pectoral fin rays is reduced (6-7 as opposed to 8 or more in other frogfish), and the Butler's frogfish can move each ray individually like [...] "fingers" [...] to steady itself or to hold on to objects. The pelvic fins contain 5 rays each and are placed <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> body. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> is densely covered with bifurcate spinules; there are also varying numbers of large, fringed filaments over the head and body. The coloration ranges from pale gray to greenish to brown, with darker markings. The fin membranes are thin and translucent.|$|R
25|$|According to George Orwell, {{coal miners}} could develop {{characteristic}} tattoos owing to coal dust getting into wounds. This can also occur with substances like gunpowder. Similarly, a traumatic tattoo {{occurs when a}} substance such as asphalt is rubbed into a wound {{as the result of}} some kind of accident or trauma. These are particularly difficult to remove as they tend to be spread across several layers of skin, and scarring or permanent discoloration is almost unavoidable depending on the location. An amalgam tattoo is when amalgam particles are implanted in to the soft tissues of the mouth, usually the gums, during dental filling placement or removal; another example of such accidental tattoos {{is the result of a}} deliberate or accidental stabbing with a pencil or pen, leaving graphite or ink <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
25|$|BMW {{said the}} flexible, {{stretchable}} water resistant translucent man-made fabric skin– polyurethane-coated Spandex, is resilient and durable. It resists {{high or low}} temperatures, does not swell or shrink and the movement does not slacken or damage the fabric. The body changes its shape according to exterior conditions and speeds, and it also allows the driver to change its shape at will. The fabric is stretched over a moveable frame; essential shapes are formed <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> by an aluminium wire structure, though at points where movement is needed (ducts, door openings, spoiler) flexible carbon struts are used. The shape of the frame is controlled by many electric and hydraulic actuators; for example, the headlights are revealed when small motors pull the fabric back in an eyelid like fashion. As the fabric is translucent the taillights shine through it.|$|E
25|$|The {{operating}} room (OR) {{time required to}} harvest, refine, and emplace fat to the breasts {{is greater than the}} usual 2-hour OR time; the usual infiltration time was approximately 2-hours for the first 100cm3 volume, and approximately 45 minutes for injecting each additional 100cm3 volume of breast-filler fat. The technique for injecting fat grafts for breast augmentation allows the plastic surgeon great control in sculpting the breasts to the required contour, especially in the correction of tuberous breast deformity. In which case, no fat-graft is emplaced beneath the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and the skin envelope of the breast is selectively expanded (contoured) with subcutaneously emplaced body-fat, immediately <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> Such controlled contouring selectively increased the proportional volume of the breast in relation {{to the size of the}} nipple-areola complex, and thus created a breast of natural form and appearance; greater verisimilitude than is achieved solely with breast implants. The fat-corrected, breast-implant deformities, were inadequate soft-tissue coverage of the implant(s) and capsular contracture, achieved with subcutaneous fat-grafts that hid the implant-device edges and wrinkles, and decreased the palpability of the underlying breast implant. Furthermore, grafting autologous fat around the breast implant can result in softening the breast capsule.|$|E
60|$|They {{formed a}} curious {{physical}} contrast, {{these two women}} in this moment.
