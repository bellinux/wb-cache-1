25|$|In One Day International cricket he has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the side, impressing {{more with}} the bat than the ball. He hit the fastest century by a Bangladeshi batsmen (86 deliveries) in a match against India during the 2008 Asia cup., a record bettered by Shakib Al Hasan two years later. He also holds the Bangladeshi record 7th wicket {{partnership}} of 89 with Khaled Mashud, made against Kenya in 2006.|$|E
25|$|He {{was never}} cut {{out to be}} an ODI player, never {{crossing}} 150 runs in a calendar year. He played his last ODI against the West Indies in 2006. His test career however, is a different story. Since he made his debut in 2001, he played every year until 2010 with 2006 being the most fruitful in terms of runs scored. He made over 300 runs in 12 innings, but the team failed to win more than 2 matches(4 innings). Since then he has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the side, playing the odd match or two. He played his last game in 2010 in a losing effort against the Australians.|$|E

25|$|Sami is {{regarded}} as one of the fastest bowlers in cricket and has the ability to swing the cricket ball at high pace. He has unofficially bowled the fastest delivery in cricket when he clocked at 164km/ph (101.9mph) during a One Day International match. However, it was revoked by cricket officials after it found faulty speed measurements on the speed meter. He also once bowled a ball that clocked in at 162.3km/ph (100.8mph) against India, which would be the 'fastest ball' in the history of cricket. But despite his speed, he has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the national side for several times. However he has received support from former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram & Waqar Younis, who sees Sami's speed and wicket taking ability as an important skill for the Pakistan team.|$|E
25|$|From the touring side, Tom Graveney, Alan Moss, Fred Trueman and Willie Watson all {{returned}} to the England Test team. Graveney had already played more than 15 Tests for England, {{though he had been}} left out of the side for the final three Tests of the 1956 Ashes, but {{returned to}} make 472 runs at a batting average over 100 in the 3–0 win over West Indies in 1957. Trueman established himself as a player in that 1957 series, taking 23 wickets after having <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the team since he was first called up to play Indian cricket team in England in 1952. Both played major parts in England Test history well into the 1960s, with Trueman becoming the first player ever to take 300 Test wickets. Moss and Watson featured in a few Tests during the final years of the 1950s, but did not make major contributions.|$|E
25|$|When Ray Illingworth left Yorkshire in 1968 it {{appeared}} that the Test career of the 36-year-old off-spinner was over, but he transferred to Leicestershire and was made captain. Although he had never been captain before his experience and knowledge of the game were widely believed to have helped Yorkshire to their County Championship victories in 1966, 1967 and 1968. The selectors had long regarded Colin Cowdrey as England's natural cricket captain, but he broke an Achilles tendon early in the season and Illingworth was his surprise replacement after only a month as county captain. Illingworth had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the national side for years, but had taken 20 wickets (13.30) against India in 1967 and 13 more (22.39) against Australia in 1968. He was originally chosen over his rivals like Brian Close as he was not a threat to Cowdrey's long-term captaincy due to his age and inability to establish a regular spot in the Test team. In the Second Test against the West Indies at Lord's in 1969, England collapsed to 61–5, but the new skipper made a forceful 113 out of the last 155 runs and became a hero. He beat both the West Indies and New Zealand 2–0 and was confirmed as captain even when Cowdrey recovered.|$|E

[...] In 1952, Regina got Bobby a scholarship (based on his chess talent and [...] "astronomically high IQ") to Brooklyn Community Woodward. Fischer later attended Erasmus Hall High School {{at the same time as}} Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond. In 1959, its student council awarded him a gold medal for his chess achievements.

500|$|On {{the night}} of December 12–13, 1994, McGovern's {{daughter}} Teresa fell into a snowbank in Madison, Wisconsin, while heavily intoxicated and died of hypothermia. Heavy press attention followed, and McGovern revealed his daughter had battled her alcoholism for years and had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> many treatment programs while having had one extended period of sobriety. He authored an account of her life, Terry: My Daughter's Life-and-Death Struggle with Alcoholism; published in 1996, it presented a harrowing, unsparing view of the depths to which she had descended, the torment {{that he and the}} rest of his family had experienced in trying unsuccessfully to help her, and his ongoing thoughts and guilt about whether the demands of his political career and the time he had spent away from the family had made things worse for her. The book was a modest best-seller, and with the proceeds, he founded the Teresa McGovern Center in Madison to help others suffering from the combination of alcoholism and mental health problems. He would later say that Terry's death was by far the most painful event in his life: [...] "You never get over it, I'm sure of that. You get so you can live with it, that's all." ...|$|E
500|$|Former {{television}} {{columnist for}} The Star-Ledger Alan Sepinwall expressed his boredom on the focus given on Grey's relationships storylines while reviewing the second season's finale: [...] "On those occasions when Meredith's {{not involved in}} a plot about her love life, I do kind of like her, but those moments are so infrequent compared to her constant angsting over McDreamy -- not to mention all those seemingly unrelated storylines that always turn into a metaphor for that relationship -- that I really, really can't stand her." [...] During the show's third season, {{the development of the}} character received negative reviews, with Cristopher Monfette of IGN stating that her storyline has become [...] "some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do." [...] Also during the third season, Robert Rorke of the New York Post noted the decline in Meredith's role in the show, expressing disappointment: [...] "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas, but lately, she's been a little dopey, what with the endless McDreamy soliloquies." [...] Similarly, Macleans.ca found their storyline in the fourth season overused, [...] "This whole 'Oh I need more time,' but 'Oh, I'm jealous if you look at someone else' angst was tired in the second season, frustrating in the third and now a total channel changer. The will-they-or-won't-they plot doesn't work because they've already <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that relationship too many times. Meredith is a nag and McDreamy is henpecked." [...] On a more positive note, her relationship with Shepherd was included in AOL TV's [...] list of the [...] "Best TV Couples of All Time" [...] and in the same list by TV Guide.|$|E
500|$|Vocalist David Draiman states that, lyrically, {{the album}} was {{inspired}} by various occurrences of bad luck that happened to him. [...] "I had a motorcycle accident, and I had my garage burn down with most of my vehicles," [...] Draiman commented. [...] "...I've had really bad relationships that I've <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of.</b> They've left their mark", he concluded. The song [...] "Indestructible" [...] is [...] "an anthem for soldiers", Draiman comments. [...] "It's meant {{to be something that}} would make them feel invincible, take away their fear, make them strong and that's what this whole body of work on this record does. It's music to help you feel strong," [...] he concludes. Cuts such as [...] "Deceiver" [...] and [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] are about [...] "really bad relationships". [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] is about [...] "standing over the body of my girlfriend, who just killed herself, and the Devil is standing over me, whispering in my ear to kill myself," [...] says Draiman. The song [...] "The Night" [...] is, [...] "just kind of meant to portray the night almost as like a living entity that sets you free. You're enveloped by it, enmasked by it," [...] Draiman comments. The band's vocalist also says the song [...] "Perfect Insanity" [...] is about [...] "toying with the idea of insanity. Coming at you from the perspective from the individual who is [...] and warning people around him, particularly his love interests, about his psychotic tendencies." [...] Draiman says the track [...] "Divide" [...] "is meant to detract from the idea 'oh, let's all be one, let's all be united!' Fuck that, be yourself, be an individual, stand out, make your mark, make an impact." [...] Commenting on the meaning of the song [...] "Façade", Draiman says it is, [...] "...a song {{from the perspective of a}} girl in a relationship where she's abused... she's thinking about killing him, like you see on the news." ...|$|E
