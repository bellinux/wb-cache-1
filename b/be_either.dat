5000|$|We {{approach}} {{the proof of}} Theorem 2 by successively restricting the class of all formulas φ for which we need to prove [...] "&phi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable". At the beginning we need to prove this for all possible formulas φ in our language. However, suppose that for every formula φ there is some formula ψ taken from a more restricted class of formulas C, such that [...] "&psi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable" [...] → [...] "&phi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable". Then, once this claim (expressed in the previous sentence) is proved, it will suffice to prove [...] "&phi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable" [...] only for φ's belonging to the class C. Note also that if φ is provably equivalent to ψ (i.e., (φ≡ψ) is provable), then it is indeed the case that [...] "&psi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable" [...] → [...] "&phi; <b>is</b> <b>either</b> refutable or satisfiable" [...] (the soundness theorem is needed to show this).|$|R

Respiratory complications tend to develop {{on about the}} eighth day of the illness and can <b>be</b> <b>either</b> viral or bacterial in origin. Secondary bacterial infection of the skin is a relatively uncommon complication {{of smallpox}}. When this occurs, the fever usually remains elevated.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors are {{molecules}} that reduce or abolish enzyme activity, while enzyme activators are {{molecules that}} increase the catalytic rate of enzymes.

Six forms of internal tapas are—atonement, reverence, rendering {{of service to}} worthy ones, spiritual study, avoiding selfish feelings and meditation.|$|E

5|$|Powers of a {{positive}} real number are always positive real numbers. The solution of x2=4, however, can <b>be</b> <b>either</b> 2 or −2. The principal value of 41/2 is 2, but −2 is also a valid square root. If the definition of exponentiation of real numbers is extended to allow negative results then the result is no longer well-behaved.|$|E
5|$|Some enzymes do {{not need}} {{additional}} components to show full activity. Others require non-protein molecules called cofactors to be bound for activity. Cofactors can <b>be</b> <b>either</b> inorganic (e.g., metal ions and iron-sulfur clusters) or organic compounds (e.g., flavin and heme). These cofactors serve many purposes; for instance, metal ions can help in stabilizing nucleophilic species within the active site. Organic cofactors can <b>be</b> <b>either</b> coenzymes, which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction, or prosthetic groups, which are tightly bound to an enzyme. Organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (e.g., biotin in enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase).|$|E
