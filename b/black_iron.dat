25|$|The {{entrance}} facade is on {{the north}} side with an unadorned high gable and subtly patterned brickwork. There are three low wide arches with the center being the largest. The front façade contains three arched windows made of Tiffany glass above the entrance doors, taller in proportion than the entrance arches.

Stone steps lead to the large arched wood double doors painted red with large elaborate <b>black</b> <b>iron</b> hinges.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, it {{was home}} to many {{prominent}} British politicians, ambassadors and civil servants. Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma (1900–1979) lived at 2 Wilton Crescent for many years, marked today by an attributive blue plaque. Akin to nearby developments, Wilton Crescent is characterised by grand terraces with lavish white houses which are built in a crescent shape, many of them with stuccoed balconies, particularly on {{the southern part of}} the crescent. The Portland stone-clad, five-storey houses toward the north are high and were refaced between 1908 and 1912 via architects Balfour and Turner. Most of the houses had originally been built in the stucco style, but such houses became stone-clad during this renovation period. Other houses today have <b>black</b> <b>iron</b> balconies.|$|E

[...] That same year, he wrote an article on the idea of a red/green coalition for a book at Olle & Wolter, Berlin; this appeared later in [...] "Die Zeit".

40|$|Carbon <b>black</b> and <b>iron</b> <b>black</b> (FeaO 4) {{are black}} {{pigments}} {{commonly used in}} the cosmetic industry. Due to its hydrophobic character, carbon black has poor dispersibility in water, and <b>iron</b> <b>black,</b> due to its ferro-mag-netic character, is not readily dispersible in any liquid. In order to solve these problems the authors investi-gated the possibility of synthesizing LOWER TITANIUM OXIDES and using them as a black pigment IN COSMETICS. The general formula of the lower titanium oxide is TinO•n- • in which n can be any positive in-teger. When n is small, the resultant compound is bluish-black. As n increases, the compound becomes gray. The lower titanium oxide most suitable for cosmetics was obtained by calcining a mixture of a titanium dioxide pigment and a metallic titanium powder in a vacuum electric furnace. While it has a tinting strength corresponding to that of carbon <b>black</b> and <b>iron</b> oxide <b>black,</b> it is superior in many other respects when used in cosmetics...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Black</b> <b>Iron</b> Prison was {{an effort}} to create an updated, modern book that would {{function}} as Principia Discordia did when released. The collaborators stated that [...] "while the original Principia Discordia holds important messages and philosophies, we wondered if some of the humor and language might be dated and lost on a younger generation of Discordians. We wanted to crystalize some of our favorite themes from the Principia, those of radical free will and self-emancipation." [...] The goal was to encourage [...] "critical thinking and self awareness" [...] in the reader.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1965, {{an article}} was {{published}} involving an antique oak rocking chair {{said to have}} been previously owned by attorney Charlie Willett, a Bell descendant. The rocking chair was recently sold in an estate sale to Mrs. J. C. Adams, owner of an antique store on U.S. 41. A customer sat down in the chair, after learning it was not for sale, and while rocking in the chair asked Mrs. Adams if she believed in the supernatural. Two weeks later, the customer's daughter visited the home of Mrs. Adams and said after her mother had left and visited the Bell cemetery a voice told her to [...] "stand up and look around, you will find something of much value." [...] After some car trouble, the woman walked out into a field and found a <b>black</b> <b>iron</b> kettle turned over. She turned the kettle over and found a pearl buckle in the grass. The woman's daughter reported a jeweler estimated the buckle to be 160 to 200 years old.|$|E

2500|$|Number 10's door is {{the product}} of the renovations Townsend ordered in 1766; it was {{probably}} not completed until 1772. Executed in the Georgian style by the architect Kenton Couse, it is unassuming and narrow, consisting of a single white stone step leading to a modest brick front. The small, six-panelled door, originally made of black oak, is surrounded by cream-coloured casing and adorned with a semicircular fanlight window. Painted in white, between the top and middle sets of panels, is the number [...] "10". The zero of the number [...] "10" [...] is painted in a very eccentric style, in a 37° angle anticlockwise. One theory is that this is in fact a capital 'O' as found in the Roman's Trajan alphabet that was used by the Ministry of Works at the time. A <b>black</b> <b>iron</b> knocker {{in the shape of a}} lion's head is between the two middle panels; below the knocker is a brass letter box with the inscription [...] "First Lord of the Treasury".

A black ironwork fence with spiked newel posts runs along the front of the house and up each side of the step to the door.

Razumov made an instinctive movement to help, which startled her so much that she nearly dropped her hissing burden. She managed, however, to land it on the table, and looked so frightened that Razumov hastened to sit down. She produced then, from an adjacent room, four glass tumblers, a teapot, and a sugar-basin, on a <b>black</b> <b>iron</b> tray.|$|E
