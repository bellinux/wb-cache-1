5|$|If the {{resulting}} short-circuit current is {{high enough to}} trip the circuit breaker then disruption of service will occur. Ash-induced flashover across transformer insulation (<b>bushings)</b> can burn, etch or crack the insulation irreparably and will likely result in the disruption of power supply.|$|E
25|$|Drill <b>bushings</b> can {{generally}} be classified as: press fit <b>bushings</b> or renewable <b>bushings.</b> Other classification methods include by head type, by use, and by liner type (or lack thereof).|$|E
25|$|In the USA, Customary sized <b>bushings</b> are {{standardized}} via ASME B94.33 and metric <b>bushings</b> are standardized via ASME B94.33.1. There {{are over}} 50,000 standard configurations of customary sized <b>bushings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Press fit are {{available}} in two types with liners or without (wearing <b>bushings).</b> Liner <b>bushings,</b> sometimes called master <b>bushings,</b> are permanently installed into the jig and accept liners that can easily be replaced. Press-fit wearing <b>bushings</b> are used in short run applications or in applications where the tolerance on a hole location is so tight that it cannot facilitate {{the use of a}} liner bushing.|$|E
25|$|Renewable <b>bushings</b> are {{installed}} in liner <b>bushings.</b> This type of bushing {{is used in}} large production runs where a bushing will wear out over time or when multiple renewable <b>bushings</b> are used in one liner to provide various sized holes. There {{are two types of}} renewable bushings: fixed and slip.|$|E
25|$|Fixed {{renewable}} <b>bushings</b> {{are used}} in applications where the liner {{is meant to be}} used until it wears out. Slip renewable <b>bushings</b> are designed to be interchangeable with a given sized liner so that two different sized slip renewable <b>bushings</b> can be used in one liner bushing. This facilitates the ability to do multiple machining operations that require different inner diameter (ID) <b>bushings,</b> such as drilling and reaming. They usually have knurled heads so they can be easily removed.|$|E
25|$|Adjusting <b>bushings</b> or {{universal}} charge bar {{settings to}} account for small differences in densities due to lot-to-lot variations in both powder and shot.|$|E
25|$|An entirely fresh {{approach}} was also taken by AMC engineers with the Pacer's front suspension and engine mounting. It {{was the first}} U.S. small car to isolate the engine and suspension system noises from the passenger compartment. The entire front suspension was mounted on a crossmember isolated from the frame extensions by heavy rubber <b>bushings.</b> It is also different from all other AMC cars with the coil spring between the two control arms, seated on the lower wishbone arm {{at the bottom and}} in the suspension/engine mount crossmember at the top. The rear suspension was also isolated, requiring a special tool to press the one-piece <b>bushings</b> {{in and out of the}} mounting brackets.|$|E
25|$|Porcelain {{and other}} ceramic {{materials}} have many applications in engineering, especially ceramic engineering. Porcelain {{is an excellent}} insulator for use at high voltage, especially in outdoor applications, see Insulator (electricity)#Material. Examples include: terminals for high-voltage cables, <b>bushings</b> of power transformers, insulation of high frequency antennas and many other components.|$|E
25|$|Like the O-ring chain it has {{sealing rings}} which keep the {{contaminant}} (dirt) out, and lubricant {{in between the}} pins and <b>bushings.</b> However, unlike O-ring chain, it has X shaped seal which does not increase surface area (which is {{in contact with the}} chain plates) when under pressure. Therefore the friction in X-ring chain does not increase much when pressure is applied by the chain plates.|$|E
25|$|The {{assembly}} is encased {{to prevent}} moisture entering the dielectricearly radio equipment used a cardboard tube sealed with wax. Modern paper or film dielectric capacitors are dipped {{in a hard}} thermoplastic. Large capacitors for high-voltage use may have the roll form compressed {{to fit into a}} rectangular metal case, with bolted terminals and <b>bushings</b> for connections. The dielectric in larger capacitors is often impregnated with a liquid to improve its properties.|$|E
25|$|Renewable <b>bushings</b> must {{be secured}} in their liner bushing, {{otherwise}} the tool can cause it to spin, which rapidly wears out the liner, or chips can force the bushing out of the liner. There are {{many different types of}} locking systems for renewable <b>bushings.</b> One system is a dog, which is a collar that is pressed over the head of the bushing and has a long tail. The tail may be bent at the end so it can lock {{around the edge of the}} jig plate or it may be left straight if it can butt up against another object. Another option to keep the renewable bushing from rotating is to pin it, either by putting a pin in the renewable bushing and a hole in the liner or vice versa. A more complicated version uses a hole in the bushing collar and a pin with a head; the head on the pin holds the edge of the collar down, but for removal the bushing can be rotated so that the hole lines up with the pin.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{commercial use}} of Bakelite in the electrical industry was the molding of tiny insulating <b>bushings</b> {{the size of}} mustard seeds, made in 1908 for the Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation by Richard W. Seabury of the Boonton Rubber Company. Bakelite was soon used for non-conducting parts of telephones, radios and other electrical devices, including bases and sockets for light bulbs and electron tubes, supports for any type of electrical components, automobile distributor caps and other insulators.|$|E
25|$|The rudder is a spade type made of {{fiberglass}} with a brass rudder stock. The {{rudder port}} is a bronze tube with <b>bushings</b> top and bottom. Steering is by tiller. The tiller head is cast bronze and is held {{on with a}} pin. This pin passes horizontally through the head and stock. An allen screw locks into a key in the rudder stock. The tiller is straight grained ash. The rudder can be rotated a full 360 degrees if needed.|$|E
25|$|Suspension was a MacPherson strut {{arrangement}} at the front, {{anchored by}} lower alloy L-arms. The wide spacing of the mounting points, compliant <b>bushings</b> and a perimeter subframe gave the model a cushioned yet precise ride with relaxed handling {{that could be}} tuned for different markets or model derivatives such as the later MG ZT. The rear suspension, {{after a period of}} uncertainty during development, was eventually a version of BMW's Z-Axle arrangement first featured on the 1988 Z1 sports car.|$|E
25|$|A {{common problem}} {{encountered}} is when {{two or more}} holes are too close for independent standard <b>bushings.</b> In this case one large renewable bushing {{can be made with}} two (or more) holes in the proper location (the first example in the image). Another possibility is to make a custom bushing with an eccentric hole and then notches {{on the outside of the}} head are used to locate the proper position of the bushing for each location (the middle example in the image). Another common need for a custom bushing is when the hole needed is perpendicular jig plate; in this case a bracket bushing is used. It is a hardened piece of right angle steel that bolts to the jig plate and is located with dowel pins.|$|E
25|$|A few {{suspension}} refinements {{were made}} for 1964. The front coil springs were changed from constant-rate to progressive or variable-rate and were more tightly wound at the top, while leaf thickness of the rear transverse spring was also altered thus providing a more comfortable ride with no sacrifice in handling. Shock absorbers were reworked toward the same end. The 1964 Corvette arrived with a new standard shock containing within its fluid reservoir a small bag of Freon gas that absorbed heat. Chevy added more sound insulation and revised body and transmission mounts for the 1964 Corvette. It also fitted additional <b>bushings</b> to quiet the shift linkage and placed a new boot around the lever. The result was a more livable car for everyday transportation.|$|E
25|$|Penske {{picked up}} the team cars and {{equipment}} from the El Segundo offices and shipped everything back to his shop in Pennsylvania. Through the fall of 1969 and into the winter, Penske used the no. 3 Jerry Grant car for developmental purposes. When he acquired the 1969 cars, Penske found that Ron Kaplan had already done considerable work with suspension, but {{he felt that the}} front suspension could still be further developed. With Mark Donohue doing the testing, Penske’s team lowered {{the front of the car}} and replaced the rubber <b>bushings</b> in the radius rods with heim joints. New roll bars were also developed. After several months of development, Donohue felt that the team now had car that drove like it was on rails.|$|E
25|$|The chassis {{design was}} as new as the bodies - with an all-new, {{sturdier}} perimeter frame, new chassis/body mounts, larger 8½inch rear axle, wider 6-inch wheel rim width, refined rear control arm <b>bushings,</b> increased {{front and rear}} suspension travel, new shock absorber location, and improved front suspension geometry - The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive camber than the right {{which resulted in a}} more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front disc brakes were now standard on all '73 Chevelles. John Z. DeLorean, Chevrolet's dynamic general manager during the design phase of the new Chevelles, left just as they were being announced. He departed in late September 1972 to start a brief stint as vice president of General Motors's Car and Truck Group. DeLorean left the new Chevelle an important legacy, though. He and Alex Mair, then Chevrolet's chief engineer, championed great handling. Critics compared the GM Colonnade line favorably to Ford and Chrysler intermediates which had unattractive styling and less interior room.|$|E
500|$|Rhodium {{is used as}} an {{alloying}} agent for hardening and improving the corrosion resistance of platinum and palladium. These alloys are used in furnace windings, <b>bushings</b> for glass fiber production, thermocouple elements, electrodes for aircraft spark plugs, and laboratory crucibles. Other uses include: ...|$|E
500|$|The bushing {{plate is}} the most {{important}} part of the machinery for making the fiber. [...] This is a small metal furnace containing nozzles for the fiber to be formed through. [...] It is almost always made of platinum alloyed with rhodium for durability. [...] Platinum is used because the glass melt has a natural affinity for wetting it. [...] When <b>bushings</b> were first used they were 100% platinum, and the glass wetted the bushing so easily that it ran under the plate after exiting the nozzle and accumulated on the underside. [...] Also, due to its cost and the tendency to wear, the platinum was alloyed with rhodium. [...] In the direct melt process, the bushing serves as a collector for the molten glass. [...] It is heated slightly to keep the glass at the correct temperature for fiber formation. [...] In the marble melt process, the bushing acts more like a furnace as it melts more of the material.|$|E
500|$|<b>Bushings</b> are {{the major}} expense in fiber glass production. [...] The nozzle design is also critical. [...] The number of nozzles ranges from 200 to 4000 in {{multiples}} of 200. [...] The {{important part of the}} nozzle in continuous filament manufacture is the thickness of its walls in the exit region. [...] It was found that inserting a counterbore here reduced wetting. [...] Today, the nozzles are designed to have a minimum thickness at the exit. [...] As glass flows through the nozzle, it forms a drop which is suspended from the end. [...] As it falls, it leaves a thread attached by the meniscus to the nozzle as long as the viscosity is in the correct range for fiber formation. [...] The smaller the annular ring of the nozzle and the thinner the wall at exit, the faster the drop will form and fall away, and the lower its tendency to wet the vertical part of the nozzle. [...] The surface tension of the glass is what influences the formation of the meniscus. [...] For E-glass it should be around 400mN/m.|$|E

[...] Tungsten {{can be found in}} printing inks, x-ray screens, photographic chemicals, in the processing of petroleum products, and flame proofing of textiles.|$|E
2500|$|The lot {{remained}} vacant {{for some}} time, until in 1941 Ford began {{construction of a}} factory on the old mill site. The plant opened in 1942, with up to 40 people making drill <b>bushings,</b> straps and seat covers. [...] However, it had a short run and closed in 1947.|$|E
2500|$|Polyurethanes {{are used}} in the {{manufacture}} of high-resilience foam seating, rigid foam insulation panels, microcellular foam seals and gaskets, durable elastomeric wheels and tires (such as roller coaster, escalator, shopping cart, elevator, and skateboard wheels), automotive suspension <b>bushings,</b> electrical potting compounds, high performance adhesives, surface coatings and surface sealants, [...] synthetic fibers (e.g., Spandex), carpet underlay, hard-plastic parts (e.g., for electronic instruments), condoms, and hoses.|$|E
2500|$|The last main {{production}} {{variant of}} the AM-34. Built during 1938–39. The crankcase was modified and bronze <b>bushings</b> {{were used for the}} main supports. It had a longer crankshaft nose, four K-4 carburetors, and a modified lubrication system. The valve castings were made of magnesium alloy. The power remained the same, but the weight increased to [...] Variants with fuel injection and two TK-1 turbochargers were tested, but not put into production.|$|E

[...] The handle {{is composed of}} a fire anodized titanium frame, oil impregnated bronze <b>bushings,</b> an oversized pivot screw [...] in diameter, and a textured G10 glass-reinforced plastic scale with an incorporated backspacer. [...] The NATO Stock Number (NSN) for the SMF knife is 1095-01-531-5015.|$|E
2500|$|The 400 was {{replaced}} for 1970 with the [...] Buick V8, {{used in the}} GS 455. The base model V8 was rated 350hp (260kW) and [...] at 2800 rpm. In the optional Stage1 trim it was rated** 360hp (268kW) and 510lb·ft (691Nm) at a low 2800 rpm. As with all American engines produced prior to the 1972 model year, these were SAE gross ratings, which are generally significantly higher than SAE net ratings and are not indicative of what actual production engines produce in their [...] "as installed" [...] condition (with all engine accessories and full exhaust system in place). [...] The fastest magazine test results from this period were obtained by MOTOR TREND Magazine, which managed to extract a 13.38 ET @ 105.5 MPH from their 3,810 pound GS Stage 1 coupe test car. Using Hale's Trap Speed formula, this result indicated actual [...] "as installed" [...] peak HP of approximately 360 SAE Net (ironically the same as its advertised Gross Figure, meaning this engine was very conservatively rated for that time period). [...] The use of the larger sized 455 block created a maintenance problem by the exhaust manifolds being in too {{close proximity to the}} upper and lower A-arm <b>bushings.</b> [...] Heat would literally melt the A-arm <b>bushings</b> after {{a relatively short period of}} time; rapid tire wear and front end alignment difficulties were the first sign of this common problem, which was common to all makes and models of this GM body style with the 455 engine. [...] It was not uncommon for front ends to be rebuilt with grease fittings added, to [...] "lube" [...] the <b>bushings</b> at the A-arms, to help against the heat.|$|E
2500|$|The new styling {{increased}} the trunk capacity of both coupes and sedans to [...] This increase was also partially achieved with a now-standard compact spare tire on a [...] wheel. A new frame lift jack replaced the bumper mounted model. A larger [...] fuel tank was standard equipment in sedans and coupes. Easy-roll radial tires, improved anti-corrosion measures, low friction ball joints and larger front suspension <b>bushings</b> were also new for 1980. Puncture-sealant tires and cornering lights were new options.|$|E
2500|$|The Boss 302 {{takes the}} Mustang GT’s {{suspension}} and adds higher-rate coil springs, stiffer <b>bushings,</b> {{and a larger}} diameter rear stabilizer bar. The body is lowered [...] up front and just [...] in the rear {{to give it a}} more raked stance designed to recall the original. The shocks are adjustable at the shock tower by using a flat head screwdriver. The standard Mustang traction and stability control programs have been altered with a new intermediate sport mode designed to allow for more flexibility on the track.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Ford {{purchased}} {{the property in}} 1921, but did not use it for some time. [...] Eventually, he constructed a new building constructed on the site, and the plant opened in 1939. [...] It employed up to 130 people making workers horn buttons and starter switches. During World War II, production shifted to brass spark plug <b>bushings</b> for B-24 bombers. [...] After the war, the line returned to making horn buttons and starter switches until 1954, when production shifted to armrests and lamp lenses.|$|E
