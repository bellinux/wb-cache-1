50|$|During the {{construction}} of the extension tunnel Oktyabrskoe Pole - Shchukinskaya a new engineering method was developed. Because the Moscow soil was sandy, the metro tunnels had traditionally been built using the open pit method (i.e. digging from the surface) or by restricting building work from passing under inhabited areas as cave-ins would have been very likely. For the Shchukinskaya tunnel however circular concrete blocks were pressed rather than mounted into the soil, and as this was done rapidly the elements did not have time to develop into heavy pressure and sap into the tunnel. This removed the need for festering a sand-cement mixture into the finish, thereby dramatically increasing the potential speed of construction, and saving on building materials. Another achievement was that no metal was used for the mounting of the tunnel blocks, instead a <b>bitumen</b> <b>mixture</b> formed from the pressure of the boring complex was used to join the blocks. As this was denser than the soil, {{there was no need for}} festering of the cement.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Water {{damage of}} asphalt {{concrete}} pavements {{has been one}} of the major distresses in highway engineering. Engineering experiences and research results indicate that this damage is due to the extortionate air voids of <b>bitumen</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Paranormal porosity of asphalt mixture is largely the result of the poor controlling of compact degree during paving process. The quality of asphalt pavement is subjected to the controlling methods of compacting of <b>bitumen</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Ultrasonic is an excellent method for non-destructive testing used in various engineering fields. It is also a potentially effective tool to be applied in the control and evaluation of the compaction quality of <b>bitumen</b> <b>mixtures.</b> This paper presents the results of a study aimed at the applicability of ultrasonic technology for evaluation of porosity and compaction quality of <b>bitumen</b> <b>mixtures.</b> It is shown that this technology, which has been successfully used for many years for evaluation of Portland concrete structures, might be used in asphalt pavement engineering to provide a simple, quick, and objective methodology for control and evaluation of the compact quality of <b>bitumen</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The results of laboratory testing demonstrate the potential of this technology...|$|R

It is compared with a traditional approach for conventional flexible pavements, which is based on pavement life as a function of computed tensile strain in the material and interpretation of fatigue data in a conventional way. The results show that the traditional design approach yields conservative outcomes for pavements with foamed <b>bitumen</b> <b>mixtures</b> if the same transfer function or shift factor used for hot mix asphalt is applied.

However, a number of previous studies found inconsistent correlation. Therefore, a study on developing new chemical-rheological models and chemical-durability indices was carried out. Two bitumen fractionation method, Rostler and Corbett methods were used to extract each chemical fraction of bitumen. A number of experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of each chemical fraction on bitumen rheology such as the effect of asphaltenes, polar aromatics, naphthene aromatics, nitrogen bases, first acidaffins, second acidaffins and paraffins on elastic modulus (G’), viscous modulus (G”) or fatigue factor (G*sin[δ]), and rutting fator (G*/sin[δ]). Two bitumen from different sources, namely Petronas petroleum bitumen and Buton rock asphalt (BRA) bitumen, were used. New chemicalrheological models were formulated to estimate the bitumen rheology in corporating parameters which are G’, G” or (G*sin[δ]), and (G*/sin[δ]) based on the chemical properties. Furthermore, new chemical durability indices that may indicate the ageing rate of bitumen during short-term and long-term ageing were also formulated. Based on statistical analyses, the models and the indices, which were developed by using chemical properties according to Rostler method were found to be invalid because the real and the predicted rheology were significantly different. While according to Corbett method the models and the indices were valid because the differences is not significant since t-score of the models and the indices were maximum 2. 679 and 2. 119 or less than t-critical 2. 797 and 2. 861 respectively).

The use of foamed bitumen for production of recycled asphalt mixtures is one of those techniques, which also allows the reduction of the mixing temperatures (warm mix technology).

The mix design parameters that were adopted in the study are mixing and compaction water content (MWC), compaction effort using a gyratory compactor and aggregate temperature. This parametric study was initially carried out on FBMs with virgin limestone aggregate without reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) material and a mix design procedure was proposed. This proposed methodology was also found to apply to FBMs with RAP. A detailed consideration was also given to characterising the RAP material so as to understand its contribution to the mechanical properties of FBMs. Optimum MWC was achieved by optimising mechanical properties such as indirect tensile stiffness modulus and indirect tensile strength (ITS-dry and ITS-wet). A rational range of 75 – 85 % of optimum water content obtained by the modified Proctor test was found to be the optimum range of MWC that gives optimum mechanical properties for FBMs. It was also found that the presence of RAP influenced the design foamed bitumen content, which means that treating RAP as black rock in FBM mix design is not appropriate. To study the influence of bitumen and water during compaction, modified Proctor compaction and gyratory compaction were employed on mixes with varying amounts of water and bitumen.

In particular, the spatial composition of the aggregate {{plays an important role in}} determining the behaviour of a foamed mix. To this end,procedures are provided that enable the interaction of moist filler and foamed bitumen to be modelled in terms mastic stiffness as well as optimal blending of aggregate fractions for most suitable foamed mix properties.

40|$|Performances {{in service}} and {{expected}} life of flexible road pavements are strongly affected by characteristics and durability of bituminous binder. It is chiefly important {{the sensitivity of}} bitumen to ageing, namely its capacity of changing chemical, physical and rheological properties in different service stages (heating extraction, <b>bitumen</b> storage, <b>mixture</b> with aggregates at high temperature, transportation and placement of mixture, air and solar exposure during service life). During these stages, ageing, which can generally be detected by the increase of consistency of bitumen, {{can be attributed to}} the loss of volatilous fractions, to the oxidation process accelerated by high temperatures and to moleculare aggregation. In the present paper the results of a study on laboratory ageing processes in bitumen, trought different laboratory methods (Rolling Thin Film Oven Test, Pressure Ageing Vessel, UV-Ageing), are presented. The experimental investigation is based on Thin-Layer Chromatographic analysis of both natural bitumen and artificially aged in order to observe changes of chemical group characteristics of bitumen. The variation of rheological properties with respect to ageing has been studied through a complete rheological analysis with the Dynamic Shear Rheometer...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{quantities}} of coconut shell (CS), {{a by-product of}} agriculture, {{can be used as}} an artificial source of coarse aggregates. In this study, four CSs were used as coarse aggregates replacement in asphalt concrete with 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, and 40 % weight volumes. The particle sizes of the CSs used as main coarse aggregates range from 5 mm to 20 mm. The Marshall Stability test shows that the optimum bitumen content for asphalt mixtures is 5. 1 %. The engineering properties investigated include the volumetric, dynamic creep, indirect tensile strength, and resilient modulus. Test results show that stability decreases with increasing CS content because of high water absorption. Considering that CSs absorb bitumen, a further detailed investigation is needed to assess the performance of modified <b>bitumen</b> on <b>mixture.</b> Furthermore, the use of CSs as coarse aggregates in asphalt concrete help increase the resilient modulus, stiffness, and indirect tensile strength up to 30 %. Generally, a 10 % replacement of coarse aggregates with CSs is the optimal limit...|$|R
