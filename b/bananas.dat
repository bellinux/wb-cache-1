Saccharified <b>banana</b> gruel with different ratios of <b>banana</b> was prepared and proximate composition, sweetness (°brix%), pH, total acidity, Hunter's color value, viscosity, free sugar, sensory evaluation, and physiological activities of the sample were measured. With increasing <b>banana</b> content, proximate composition, sweetness, and acidity of <b>banana</b> gruel increased, and pH showed a significant decrease (P< 0. 05). Saccharified <b>banana</b> gruel prepared with 15 ～ 45 % <b>banana</b> showed significantly lower viscosity. As the level of <b>banana</b> increased, L-value decreased, whereas the a-value, b-value increased.
