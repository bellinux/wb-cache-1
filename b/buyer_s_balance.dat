40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{coordination}} of order and production policy between buyers and suppliers in supply chains. When a buyer and a supplier of an item work independently, the buyer will place orders based on his economic order quantity (EOQ). However, the <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> EOQ may not lead to an optimal policy for the supplier. It can be shown that a cooperative batching policy can reduce total cost significantly. Should the buyer have the more powerful position to enforce his EOQ on the supplier, then no incentive exists for him to deviate from his EOQ in order to choose a cooperative batching policy. To provide an incentive to order in quantities suitable to the supplier, the supplier could offer a side payment. One critical assumption made throughout in the literature dealing with incentive schemes to influence <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> ordering policy is that the supplier has complete information regarding <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> cost structure. However, this assumption is far from realistic. As a consequence, the buyer has no incentive to report truthfully on his cost structure. Moreover there is an incentive to overstate the total relevant cost in order to obtain as high a side payment as possible. This paper provides a bargaining model with asymmetric information about the <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> cost structure assuming that the buyer has the bargaining power to enforce his EOQ on the supplier in case of a break-down in negotiations. An algorithm for the determination of an optimal set of contracts which are specifically designed for different cost structures of the buyer, assumed by the supplier, will be presented. This algorithm was implemented in a software application, that supports the supplier in determining the optimal set of contracts...|$|R

The model stylizes a buyer-seller relationship but the results apply quite naturally to many contractual situations including regulation and optimal income-taxation. I. rst show, through a simple example, that distortions need not vanish over time and need not be monotonic in the shock to the <b>buyer.</b> <b>s</b> valuation. These results are in contrast to those obtained in the literature that assumes a Markov process with a binary state space. e. g. Battaglini, 2005. I then show that when the sets of possible types in any two adja-cent periods satisfy a certain overlapping condition (which is always satis. ed with a continuum of types), then the dynamics of the optimal mechanism can be signi. cantly simpli. ed by as-suming the shocks are independent over time. Under certain regularity conditions, the optimal mechanism is then the same irrespective of whether the shocks are the <b>buyer.</b> <b>s</b> private informa-tion or are observed also by the seller. These conditions are satis. ed, for example, {{in the case of an}} AR(1) process, a Brownian motion, but also when shocks have a multiplicative e as it is often the case in. nancial applications. Furthermore, the distortions in the optimal quantities are independent of the distributions of the shocks and, when the <b>buyer.</b> <b>s</b> valuation is additively separable, they are also independent of whether the shocks are transitory or permanent. Finally, I show that assuming the shocks are independent not only greatly simpli. es the analysis but is actually without loss of generality with a continuum of types...|$|R

40|$|According to Godley, the {{significance}} of the deficit in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>balance</b> of payments has been underestimated in both public policy and academic discussions despite the fact that U. S. markets are increasingly dominated by foreign manufacturers and the main cause of the 20 -year deterioration in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>balance</b> of trade is that domination. Godley analyzes the problem posed by the U. <b>S.</b> <b>balance</b> of payments deficit. Breaking down the current account into its component parts, he traces the cause of the deficit. He refutes the arguments of other economists that the balance of payments deficit is self-correcting, unimportant, or the result of other domestic forces (namely, too low a level of national saving) and outlines policy approaches to solving the problem. Godley notes that although the strategic problems posed are specific to this country and the United States may have to take unilateral action to solve them, the problems have arisen because there is no significant international regulation of the system as a whole. Inherent flaws have developed in the system of international production, trade, and payments as that system has expanded and become increasingly deregulated.

40|$|Sulphate {{leaching}} losses {{may reduce}} the long-term possibility of maintaining the S supply of crops in low input farming systems. Sulphate leaching and <b>S</b> <b>balances</b> were investigated in an organic dairy/crop rotation (barley [Hordeum vulgare]  grass-clover [Lolium perenne/Trifolium repens]  grass-clover  barley/pea [Pisum arvénse]  winter wheat [Tritucum aestivum]  fodder beet [Beta vulgaris]) from 1994 until 1998. The importance of climatic conditions and use of different organic manure types at different application rates for sulphate leaching were investigated and related to the concurrent nitrate leaching. As an average of years, sulphate leaching from the crop rotation was 20 kg S ha- 1, which was equivalent to 60 % of the total input to the rotation. Sulphate leaching was very variable over the years (4 - 45 kg S ha- 1 for the same crop) and {{closely related to the}} annual drainage volume (r 2 = 0. 99; P< 0. 01). The same relationship between drainage and nitrate leaching was not significant. No differences were observed in sulphate leaching between the organic manure types or the application rates, but significant differences were found in sulphate leaching between the different crops in the rotation. In the year with the largest drainage volume, there was a significant correlation between the S input in irrigation and sulphate leaching (r 2 = 0. 69; P< 0. 05). The <b>S</b> <b>balance</b> was slightly positive when averaged over the four years, as more S was imported than removed. Thus, immediate S deficiency may not occur, but in the longer term a negative <b>S</b> <b>balance</b> must be expected in this crop rotation. However, even with a positive overall <b>S</b> <b>balance,</b> the <b>S</b> input is not necessarily synchronised with plant needs. In order to maintain a sufficient S supply in the future when further reductions in the atmospheric deposition are expected, it is important to reduce leaching losses of sulphate...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} an {{open economy}} portfolio balance model with endogenous asset supply. Domestic producers choose an optimal capital structure and finance capital goods through credit, bonds and equity assets.

Within this general equilibrium model, it will be shown that central bank interventions may promote an inefficient international allocation of real capital.

Most model projections of the future path of U. <b>S.</b> external <b>balance</b> show the recent improvement petering out by the end 1989 or so. Key structural factors leading to the expected future worsening of U. <b>S.</b> external <b>balance</b> are two asymmetries [...] the "income asymmetry" and the "pass-through asymmetry". That is, asymmetries in the pricing behavior of U. S. exporters and foreign suppliers and asymmetries in the elasticities of U. S. demand for imports and foreign demand for U. S. exports with respect to economic activity.; However, could projections based on historical relationships be misleading? Have these models ignored important changes in the international environment? Changes in trading partners and composition of trade, in income responsiveness, exchange rate movements and price competitiveness, the net debt position, trade protection, long-term supply response, and model uncertainty are considered.; Plausible (or sometimes implausible) changes in the historical relationships do not materially change the medium-term outlook for a future deterioration in U. <b>S.</b> external <b>balance.</b> However, model uncertainty suggests that confidence intervals around the point estimates of key parameters are sufficiently large that periods of improvement in U. <b>S.</b> external <b>balance</b> are {{within the realm of}} statistical probability; nevertheless, the outlook for sustained improvement remains problematical.; This suggests that outcomes for growth and the exchange rate different from those assumed in the projections, and which would probably stem from a different configuration of fiscal and monetary policies here and abroad, are likely necessary to put U. <b>S.</b> external <b>balance</b> on a sustainable path.
