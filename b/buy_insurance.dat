5|$|President Bill Clinton {{proposed}} a healthcare reform bill in 1993 {{that included a}} mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees through a regulated marketplace of health maintenance organizations. Republican Senators {{proposed a}}n alternative that would have required individuals, but not employers, to <b>buy</b> <b>insurance.</b> Ultimately the Clinton plan failed amid an unprecedented barrage of negative advertising funded by politically conservative groups and the health insurance industry and due to concerns that it was overly complex. Clinton negotiated a compromise with the 105th Congress to instead enact the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in 1997.|$|E
5|$|States that {{rejected}} the Medicaid expansion could maintain their Medicaid eligibility thresholds, which {{in many states}} were significantly below 133% of the poverty line. Many states did not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level. Because subsidies on exchange insurance plans were not available to those below the poverty line, such individuals had no new options. For example, in Kansas, where only able-bodied adults with children and with an income below 32% of the poverty line were eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% of the poverty level ($6,250 to $19,530 {{for a family of}} three) were ineligible for both Medicaid and federal subsidies to <b>buy</b> <b>insurance.</b> Absent children, able-bodied adults were not eligible for Medicaid in Kansas.|$|E

25|$|The party opposes a government-run single-payer {{health care}} system, {{claiming}} {{such a system}} constitutes socialized medicine. While opposed to the Affordable Care Act and its requirement to <b>buy</b> <b>insurance,</b> some Republicans support some of its provisions, such as laws promoting coverage of pre-existing medical conditions. The Republican Party has a mixed record of supporting the historically popular Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid programs.|$|E
25|$|The Associated Press {{reported}} in September 2008 that Senator Obama was proposing a National Health Insurance Exchange {{that would include}} both private insurance plans and a Medicare-like government run option. Coverage would be guaranteed regardless of health status, and premiums would not vary based on health status either. The campaign estimates {{the cost of the}} program at $60 billion annually. The plan requires that parents cover their children, but does not require adults to <b>buy</b> <b>insurance.</b>|$|E
50|$|In normal {{insurance}} markets, insurers price high-risk {{individuals at}} a higher premium to discourage them from <b>buying</b> <b>insurance</b> and offer lower-risk individuals lower premiums. That can make insurance phenomenally expensive {{for the elderly and}} those in poor health at a time that they can least afford to pay for insurance because they are not earning an income. Young people, on the other hand, for whom ill health is not a major concern, often do not <b>buy</b> health <b>insurance</b> even though it is relatively cheap for them to do so.|$|R
50|$|Foreign-invested {{enterprises}} {{are required}} to provide health insurance benefits, but {{are not required to}} participate in the basic plan. For example, for employees of foreign enterprises in Beijing hired through Foreign Enterprises Service Corp. (FESCO), foreign enterprises pay FESCO, and FESCO then <b>buys</b> <b>insurance</b> policies for these employees. The government also allows commercial health insurers to operate in China.|$|R

25|$|The {{exemption}} of employer-sponsored {{health benefits}} from federal income and payroll taxes distorts {{the health care}} market. The U.S. government, unlike some other countries, does not treat employer funded health care benefits as a taxable benefit in kind to the employee. The value of the lost tax revenue from a benefits in kind tax is an estimated $150billion a year. Some regard this as being disadvantageous {{to people who have}} to <b>buy</b> <b>insurance</b> in the individual market which must be paid from income received after tax.|$|E
25|$|Much {{consolidation}} {{occurred in}} the financial services industry since, {{but not at the}} scale some had expected. Retail banks, for example, do not tend to <b>buy</b> <b>insurance</b> underwriters, as they seek to engage in a more profitable business of insurance brokerage by selling products of other insurance companies. Other retail banks were slow to market investments and insurance products and package those products in a convincing way. Brokerage companies had a hard time getting into banking, because {{they do not have a}} large branch and backshop footprint. Banks have recently tended to buy other banks, such as the 2004 Bank of America and Fleet Boston merger, yet they have had less success integrating with investment and insurance companies. Many banks have expanded into investment banking, but have found it hard to package it with their banking services, without resorting to questionable tie-ins which caused scandals at Smith Barney.|$|E
25|$|The {{particular}} synthetic CDO {{that the}} SEC's 2010 fraud suit charged Goldman with misleading investors with was called Abacus 2007-AC1. Unlike {{many of the}} Abacus securities, 2007-AC1 did not have Goldman Sachs as a short seller, in fact, Goldman Sachs lost money on the deal. That position {{was taken by the}} customer (John Paulson) who hired Goldman to issue the security (according to the SEC's complaint). Paulson and his employees selected 90 BBB-rated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to <b>buy</b> <b>insurance</b> for. Paulson and the manager of the CDO, ACA Management, worked on the portfolio of 90 bonds to be insured (ACA allegedly unaware of Paulson's short position), coming to an agreement in late February 2007. Paulson paid Goldman approximately US$15 million for its work in the deal. Paulson ultimately made a US$1 billion profit from the short investments, the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers. These were primarily IKB Deutsche Industriebank (US$150 million loss), and the investors and insurers of another US$900 million—ACA Financial Guaranty Corp, ABN AMRO, and the Royal Bank of Scotland.|$|E

500|$|The act largely {{retains the}} {{existing}} structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market, but individual markets were radically overhauled around a three-legged scheme.

To combat resultant adverse selection, the act mandates that individuals <b>buy</b> <b>insurance</b> and insurers cover a list of [...] "essential health benefits". To help households between 100–400% of the Federal Poverty Line afford these compulsory policies, the law provides insurance premium subsidies.

2500|$|In 2006, Massachusetts {{adopted a}} plan that vastly {{reduced the number of}} uninsured making it the state with the lowest {{percentage}} of non-insured residents in the union.

Some have claimed that the state's program is unaffordable, which the state itself says is [...] "a commonly repeated myth". In 2009, in a minor amendment, the plan did eliminate dental, hospice and skilled nursing care for certain categories of noncitizens covering 30,000 people (victims of human trafficking and domestic violence, applicants for asylum and refugees) who do pay taxes.|$|E
30|$|Notably, {{compensation}} is only triggered once a specified threshold mortality (15 % in current contracts) has been surpassed, and only compensates for losses {{in excess of}} the threshold.

These may not be limited, waived or contracted out of, but companies may <b>buy</b> <b>insurance</b> to cover directors for costs {{in the event of}} breach. The remedies for breaches of duty were not codified, but follow common law and equity, and include compensation for losses, restitution of illegitimate gains and specific performance or injunctions.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{legislative}} proposals under {{serious consideration}} propose fining larger employers {{who do not}} provide a minimum standard of healthcare insurance and mandating that people purchase private healthcare insurance. This {{is the first time}} that the Federal government has mandated people to <b>buy</b> <b>insurance,</b> although nearly all states in the union currently mandate the purchase of auto insurance. The legislation also taxes certain very high payout insurance policies (so-called [...] "Cadillac policies") to help finance subsidies for poorer citizens. These will be offered on a sliding scale to people earning less than four times the federal poverty level to enable them to buy health insurance if they are not otherwise covered by their employer.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{institutional}} insurance purchasers <b>buy</b> <b>insurance</b> {{through an}} insurance broker. While {{on the surface}} it appears the broker represents the buyer (not the insurance company), and typically counsels the buyer on appropriate coverage and policy limitations, {{in the vast majority}} of cases a broker's compensation comes in the form of a commission as a percentage of the insurance premium, creating a conflict of interest in that the broker's financial interest is tilted towards encouraging an insured to purchase more insurance than might be necessary at a higher price. A broker generally holds contracts with many insurers, thereby allowing the broker to [...] "shop" [...] the market for the best rates and coverage possible.|$|E
