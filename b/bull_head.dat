5|$|Around 5:30a.m. on December 15, 39 police {{officers}} and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Lt. <b>Bull</b> <b>Head</b> told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside. Sitting Bull and his wife noisily stalled for time, the camp awakened and men converged at the house. As Lt. Bullhead ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he said the Indian Affairs agent needed to see the chief, and then he could return to his house. When Sitting Bull refused to comply, the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. Catch-the-Bear, a Lakota, shouldered his rifle and shot Lt. Bullhead, who reacted by firing his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull. Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and he dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.|$|E
5|$|In 1840 the <b>Bull</b> <b>Head</b> Turnpike Company built {{a private}} toll road {{known today as}} the Sag Harbor Turnpike, which {{operated}} successfully until a competing railroad line opened in the 1880s. In 1906 the town of Southampton {{took control of the}} now dilapidated road and removed the toll gates. NY114 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and is known in part as the Sag Harbor Turnpike. The bridge carrying NY114 between Sag Harbor and North Haven is an arched bridge that serves as a village landmark. In 1999, residents successfully fought state proposals to replace it with a girder bridge. Instead, the bridge was replaced with a new, wider bridge with ornamental lamps that closely resembles the original and is in the same location.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, {{feared that}} the Lakota leader was about to flee the {{reservation}} with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him. On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry Bullhead (noted as <b>Bull</b> <b>Head</b> in lead), an Indian agency policeman, that included instructions and a plan to capture Sitting Bull. The plan called for the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised {{the use of a}} light spring wagon to facilitate removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.|$|E

Elsewhere T rails {{were replaced by}} <b>bull</b> <b>head</b> rails of a rounded 'I' or 'figure-8' appearance which still required a supporting chair. Eventually the flanged T rail became commonplace on all the world's railways, though differences in the fixing system still exist.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{bullhead}} shark {{was originally}} described as Cestracion japonicus by ichthyologists Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay and William John Macleay, in an 1884 volume of Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. The type specimen is a female caught off Tokyo. Other common names {{used for this}} species include <b>bull</b> <b>head,</b> cat shark, Japanese horn shark, Cestracion shark, and Port Jackson shark (which usually refers to Heterodontus portusjacksoni).|$|E
25|$|The small, {{possibly}} improvised temple on the eastside of {{the pyramid}} was constructed in the first building phase of the mortuary temple. The limestone temple has a north-south orientation. A step ramp enables entry from the southeast. This temple had a mandatory offering hall {{as well as a}} room for the ritual purgation on the entry. Imprints of an altar were at that time verifiable. A false door was located on the west wall, which contained gold-plated inscriptions. Offerings such as a <b>bull</b> <b>head</b> and sacrificial vessels were found below the paving of the temple. There might have been two boat pits at the temple for worship boats. No evidence was found in the remains for the builder, thus the direct successor of Raneferef is unknown. It is believed that short-ruling Shepseskare was the successor, as seal impressions of him were found {{in the area of the}} mortuary temple.|$|E
5000|$|The {{community}} {{received its}} name from an 18th-century tavern located {{at the intersection of}} Victory Boulevard and Richmond Avenue (the neighborhood's central point), from which a sign bearing a <b>bull's</b> <b>head</b> was displayed. (The <b>Bulls</b> <b>Head</b> area was also known as Phoenixville.) During the American Revolution, this tavern became the local headquarters of the faction loyal to the British crown, or Tories, as they were colloquially known. As recently as the early 1960s, <b>Bulls</b> <b>Head</b> and the surrounding neighborhoods, such as Willowbrook to the east and Graniteville to the north, were dominated by farmland. Dramatic change came soon after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened in 1964, opening up the area to residential development. Soon many Jewish families, mostly from the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, settled in <b>Bulls</b> <b>Head</b> and other west mid-island neighborhoods. A smaller number of Asian immigrants live in <b>Bulls</b> <b>Head.</b> Many of the residents are Italian Catholics served by Our Lady of Pity R.C. Church.|$|R

500|$|After {{working as}} a {{performer}} with Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency in South Dakota. Because of fears that he would use his influence to support the Ghost Dance movement, Indian Service agent James McLaughlin at Fort Yates ordered his arrest. During an ensuing struggle between Sitting Bull's followers and the agency police, Sitting Bull {{was shot in the}} side and head by Standing Rock policemen Lieutenant <b>Bull</b> <b>Head</b> (Tatankapah, [...] ) and Red Tomahawk (Marcelus Chankpidutah, [...] ) after the police were fired upon by Sitting Bull's supporters. His body was taken to nearby Fort Yates for burial. In 1953, his Lakota family exhumed what were believed to be his remains, reburying them near Mobridge, South Dakota, near his birthplace.|$|E

Local fishing tournaments also occur at Gardner Lake. As a result of the improvements to the boat launch area, boating and kayaking have increased greatly and police had to up the patrols at the lake. The area is patrolled by the Montville police and it costs the majority of annual budget, but the service was seen as beneficial {{to ensure the safety of}} boaters and enforcing the rules.|$|E

60|$|And {{right here}} {{something}} happened to me, the gravity of which I never dreamed for many a long year to come. I had {{had no intention of}} stopping at Benicia. The tide favoured, the wind was fair and howling--glorious sailing for a sailor. <b>Bull</b> <b>Head</b> and Army Points showed ahead, marking the entrance to Suisun Bay which I knew was smoking. And yet, when I laid eyes on those fishing arks lying in the water-front tules, without debate, on the instant, I put down my tiller, came in on the sheet, and headed for the shore. On the instant, out of the profound of my brain-fag, I knew what I wanted. I wanted to drink. I wanted to get drunk.|$|E
60|$|She {{fell asleep}} at last, and dreamed {{that she was}} in a boat alone on the river near her country cottage, {{drifting}} along among spiky flowers like asphodels, with birds singing and flying round her. She could move neither face nor limbs, but that helpless feeling was not unpleasant, till she became conscious that she was drawing nearer and nearer to what was neither water nor land, light nor darkness, but simply some unutterable feeling. And then she saw, gazing at her out of the rushes on the banks, a great <b>bull</b> <b>head.</b> It moved as she moved--it was on both sides of her, yet all the time only one head. She tried to raise her hands and cover her eyes, but could not--and woke with a sob.... It was light.|$|E
60|$|And {{here the}} point is drawn to its sharpest. Granted my prodigious brain-fag, nevertheless, had I never drunk in the past, the thought would never have entered my mind to get drunk now. Beginning with {{physical}} intolerance for alcohol, for years drinking only {{for the sake of}} comradeship and because alcohol was everywhere on the adventure-path, I had now reached the stage where my brain cried out, not merely for a drink, but for a drunk. And had I not been so long used to alcohol, my brain would not have so cried out. I should have sailed on past <b>Bull</b> <b>Head,</b> and in the smoking white of Suisun Bay, and in the wine of wind that filled my sail and poured through me, I should have forgotten my weary brain and rested and refreshed it.|$|E

60|$|Without {{more words}} on either side, there ensued the most awful fight between Theseus and the Minotaur that ever {{happened}} beneath the sun or moon. I really know not how it might have turned out, if the monster, in his first headlong rush against Theseus, had not missed him, by a hair's breadth, and broken one of his horns short off against the stone wall. On this mishap, he bellowed so intolerably that {{a part of the}} labyrinth tumbled down, and all the inhabitants of Crete mistook the noise for an uncommonly heavy thunder storm. Smarting with the pain, he galloped around the open space in so ridiculous a way that Theseus laughed at it, long afterwards, though not precisely at the moment. After this, the two antagonists stood valiantly up to one another, and fought, sword to horn, for a long while. At last, the Minotaur made a run at Theseus, grazed his left side with his horn, and flung him down; and thinking that he had stabbed him to the heart, he cut a great caper in the air, opened his bull mouth from ear to ear, and prepared to snap his head off. But Theseus by this time had leaped up, and caught the monster off his guard. Fetching a sword stroke at him with all his force, he hit him fair upon the neck, and made his <b>bull</b> <b>head</b> skip six yards from his human body, which fell down flat upon the ground.|$|E
60|$|It is {{a darkened}} chamber in the College of Alcala, {{in the year}} 1562, where lies, {{probably}} in a huge four-post bed, shrouded in stifling hangings, the heir-apparent of the greatest empire in the then world, Don Carlos, only son of Philip II. and heir-apparent of Spain, the Netherlands, and all the Indies. A short sickly boy of sixteen, with a <b>bull</b> <b>head,</b> a crooked shoulder, a short leg, and a brutal temper, {{he will not be}} missed by the world if he should die. His profligate career seems to have brought its own punishment. To the scandal of his father, who tolerated no one's vices save his own, {{as well as to the}} scandal of the university authorities of Alcala, he has been scouring the streets at the head of the most profligate students, insulting women, even ladies of rank, and amenable only to his lovely young stepmother, Elizabeth of Valois, Isabel de la Paz, as the Spaniards call her, the daughter of Catherine do Medicis, and sister of the King of France. Don Carlos should have married her, had not his worthy father found it more advantageous for the crown of Spain, as well as more pleasant for him, Philip, to marry her himself. Whence came heart-burnings, rage, jealousies, romances, calumnies, of which two last--in as far at least as they concern poor Elizabeth--no wise man now believes a word.|$|E
6000|$|A certain {{citizen who}} had lived safe and {{untouched}} till the month of September, when {{the weight of the}} distemper lay more in the city than it had done before, was mighty cheerful, and something too bold, as I think it was, in his talk of how secure he was, how cautious he had been, and how he had never come near any sick body. Says another citizen, a neighbor of his, to him one day, [...] "Do not be too confident, Mr. ----: it is hard to say who is sick and who is well; for we see men alive and well to outward appearance one hour, and dead the next."--"That is true," [...] says the first man (for he was not a man presumptuously secure, but had escaped a long while; and men, as I have said above, especially in the city, began to be overeasy on that score),--"that is true," [...] says he. [...] "I do not think myself secure; but I hope I have not been in company with any person that there has been any danger in."--"No!" [...] says his neighbor. [...] "Was not you at the <b>Bull</b> <b>Head</b> Tavern in Gracechurch Street, with Mr. ----, the night before last?"--"Yes," [...] says the first, [...] "I was; but there was nobody there that we had any reason to think dangerous." [...] Upon which his neighbor said no more, being unwilling to surprise him. But this made him more inquisitive, and, as his neighbor appeared backward, he was the more impatient; and in a kind of warmth says he aloud, [...] "Why, he is not dead, is he?" [...] Upon which his neighbor still was silent, but cast up his eyes, and said something to himself; at which the first citizen turned pale, and said no more but this, [...] "Then I am a dead man too!" [...] and went home immediately, and sent for a neighboring apothecary to give him something preventive, for he had not yet found himself ill. But the apothecary, opening his breast, fetched a sigh, and said no more but this, [...] "Look up to God." [...] And the man died in a few hours.|$|E
