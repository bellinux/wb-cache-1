5|$|Like Compton, many U.S. {{officials}} and scientists {{argued that a}} demonstration would sacrifice the shock value of the atomic attack, and the Japanese could deny the atomic bomb was lethal, making the mission less likely to produce surrender. Allied prisoners of war might be moved to the demonstration site and be killed by the bomb. They also worried that the bomb might be a dud since the Trinity test was of a stationary device, not an air-dropped bomb. In addition, only two bombs would <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>at</b> the start of August, although more were in production, and they cost billions of dollars, so using one for a demonstration would be expensive.|$|E
