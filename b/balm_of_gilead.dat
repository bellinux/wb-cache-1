Yet, inside the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Gilead,</b> she gets many negative views from the society for being a handmaiden. She thinks {{that the best way}} to be afar from death is pressing her own desire to run away from the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Gilead</b> and behaving as what the society requires her to behave. Here, the writer has found that Offred is using some strategies of survival to survive inside the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Gilead.</b> Therefore, the writer wants to know what strategies of survival are used by Offred in order to survive in the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Gilead.</b> To analyze this, the writer uses some sources on feminism that she gets from internet and library research. Considering the feminist issue, the writer uses the cultural approach, especially the concept of patriarchy and the feminine traits. The writer finds out that the {{main character}}, Offred, succeeds in surviving from the society?s pressure by using her feminine traits. The use of her feminine traits has brought her freedom the other women in the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Gilead</b> would never get. Yet, Offred will never be successful in achieving her freedom without the helps of other characters. By opening chances for other people to help her and encouraging herself to keep patient and strong, Offred has fulfilled her desire in escaping from the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Gilead.</b> Furthermore, Offred?s self-control, awareness, and rational thinking have brought her away from the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Gilead...</b>|$|R

The scenery, the perpetual stone fences, (some venerable old fellows, dark-spotted with lichens)--the many fine locust-trees--the runs of brawling water, often over descents of rock--these, and lots else. It is lucky the roads are first-rate here, (as they are,) for it is up or down hill everywhere, and sometimes steep enough. B. has a tip-top horse, strong, young, and both gentle and fast.

6000|$|ONE of {{the reasons}} why Tom's mind had drifted away from its secret {{troubles}} was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to [...] "whistle her down the wind," [...] but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father's house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat; there was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to try all manner of remedies on him. She {{was one of those people}} who are infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of producing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in these things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing, but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the [...] "Health" [...] periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the [...] "rot" [...] they contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up, and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and what frame of mind to keep one's self in, and what sort of clothing to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they had recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest as the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed with death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with [...] "hell following after." [...] But she never suspected that she was not an angel of healing and the <b>balm</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gilead</b> in disguise, to the suffering neighbors.|$|E
6000|$|Although they thus {{disagreed}} on {{the principal}} object of Thome Reid's visits, Bessie Dunlop affirmed {{he continued to}} come to her frequently, and assist her with his counsel; and that if any one consulted her about the ailments of human beings or of cattle, or the recovery of things lost and stolen, she was, by the advice of Thome Reid, always able to answer the querists. She was also taught by her (literally ghostly) adviser how to watch the operation of the ointments he gave her, and to presage from them the recovery or death of the patient. She said Thome gave her herbs with his own hand, with which she cured John Jack's bairn and Wilson's of the Townhead. She also was helpful to a waiting-woman of the young Lady Stanlie, daughter of the Lady Johnstone, whose disease, according to the opinion of the infallible Thome Reid, was [...] "a cauld blood that came about her heart," [...] and frequently caused her to swoon away. For this Thome mixed a remedy as generous as the <b>balm</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gilead</b> itself. It was composed of the most potent ale, concocted with spices and a little white sugar, to be drunk every morning before taking food. For these prescriptions Bessie Dunlop's fee was a peck of meal and some cheese. The young woman recovered. But the poor old Lady Kilbowie could get no help for her leg, which had been crooked for years; for Thome Reid said the marrow of the limb was perished and the blood benumbed, so that she would never recover, and if she sought further assistance, it would be the worse for her. These opinions indicate common sense and prudence at least, whether we consider them as originating with the umquhile Thome Reid, or with the culprit whom he patronized. The judgments given in the case of stolen goods were also well chosen; for though they seldom led to recovering the property, they generally alleged such satisfactory reasons for its not being found as effectually to cover the credit of the prophetess. Thus Hugh Scott's cloak could not be returned, because the thieves had gained time to make it into a kirtle. James Jamieson and James Baird would, by her advice, have recovered their plough-irons, which had been stolen, had it not been the will of fate that William Dougal, sheriff's officer, one of the parties searching for them, should accept a bribe of three pounds not to find them. In short, although she lost a lace which Thome Reid gave her out of his own hand, which, tied round women in childbirth, had the power of helping their delivery, Bessy Dunlop's profession of a wise woman seems to have flourished indifferently well till it drew the evil eye of the law upon her.|$|E
60|$|But {{with what}} fitness, {{let it be}} asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the {{concession}} of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire {{of which he is}} a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate. He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy's scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe's hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic. It ill becomes him to preach that gospel. Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare? A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life. If he must dispense his <b>balm</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gilead</b> in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him. His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.|$|E
