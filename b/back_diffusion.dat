40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} established to estimate the radon emanation rates and <b>back</b> <b>diffusion</b> rates of different building materials in small chamber tests. The two parameters, emanation rate and <b>back</b> <b>diffusion</b> rate, {{can be obtained from}} the growth curve of the chamber radon activity. Small impervious containers with a volume of 14900 c. c. were used in the measurement and solid-state radon detectors were used to monitor the chamber radon levels continuously. In the study, the building materials were left inside the chamber for more than 400 hours in order to reach equilibrium radon concentrations. The emanation rates and the <b>back</b> <b>diffusion</b> rates of the samples were found to be fairly constant under the experimental conditions. The emanation rate was determined by the initial slope of the growth curve and the <b>back</b> <b>diffusion</b> rate was determined by the equilibrium value of the activity curve. Leakage of the chamber was estimated by checking the radon free decay rate inside the chamber before each experiment and a correction was included in the calculation. Two kinds of granite and one bare concrete were selected as test samples. The first granite sample had a mean emanation rate of 13. 44 Bq · m - 2 · hr - 1 and a <b>back</b> <b>diffusion</b> rate of 6. 89 × 10 4 hr - 1.

Two different methods are adapted for measuring both the leakage rate and the <b>back</b> <b>diffusion</b> rate. The leakage rate can be determined from the initial slope of the radon decay curve or from the exponential fitting of the whole decay curve.

In this study, <b>back</b> <b>diffusion</b> of {{manganese}} {{in solid}} between secondary {{arms in the}} ternary Fe – 1. 6 wt % Mn – 0. 1, 0. 21, 0. 4 and 0. 75 wt % C alloys was investigated in unidirectionally solidified quenched specimens which solidified {{in the range of}} 0. 25 K/s to 4. 15 K/s cooling rates. Manganese <b>back</b> <b>diffusion</b> in the solid phase during the growth has a large influence on microsegregation when the first solid formed is delta-ferrite.

In this study, a rotating disk module (RDM) equipped with four micro- and ultra-filtration membranes {{was used to}} treat raw chicory root extract, and the permeate flux behavior at high-shear conditions was investigated. Increasing disk rotating speed can reduce concentration polarization and cake fouling, and thus improve permeate flux. However, a moderate rotating speed of 1000 rpm was a good compromise between energy saving and polarization/cake layers control, while a higher disk rotating speed can be used at regular intervals for on-line membrane cleaning. Threshold and limiting fluxes were determined in chicory juice clarification at 1000 rpm and 50 degrees C by pressure stepping experiments, and they were almost independent of pore size, permeability and fouling extent, with ranges of 130 - 140 L m(- 2) h(- 1) for threshold and 155 - 168 L m(- 2) h(- 1) for limiting flux. Below threshold flux, filtration resistance is independent of flux, while above it, membrane fouling increases with increasing permeate flux. This work confirmed that threshold flux criterion was also applicable to high-shear microfiltration and ultrafiltration, and size-dependent shear-induced and Brownian <b>back</b> <b>diffusions</b> {{played an important role}} in such filtration resistance transition.

This model permitted simultaneous evaluation of two segments of mucosa, one control and the other test, supplied by the same vascular pedicle.

Topical application of 25 microgram dmPGE 2 in 20 ml 0. 3 M HC 1 to the test chamber for 30 minutes prevented acid secretion from the test mucosa during a second histamine infusion. Since the control chamber showed no evidence of inhibition this indicates that dmPGE 2 acted directly on the secretory cells, rather than after absorption from the bloodstream.

Low permeability layers store contaminants by molecular diffusion when plume of contaminant gets in touch with them, creating a concentration gradient between low and high permeability zones. After removal of {{the primary source of}} contamination, concentration gradient became inverse bringing a slow re-distribution of contaminant in groundwater (<b>Back</b> <b>Diffusion).</b> Therefore low permeability zones became a secondary source of contamination.

A Representation of the process was carried out using a Plexiglas tank and Sodium Fluorescein as fluorescent tracer.

The lenses were saturated with a solution containing dissolved Fluorescein and inside the aquifer was flushed clean water at different velocities to investigate the effects of pumping water on the low permeability lenses rate of release.
