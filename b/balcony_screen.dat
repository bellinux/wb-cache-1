50|$|The theater's focus {{went back}} to first run films by the mid-1980s due to an {{increase}} in video VHS releases and cable. In the mid-1980s the theater owners did a $400,000 renovation. They removed a group of seats from the downstairs auditorium so a projector could be installed. The seating capacity was changed to 546 seats. The owners changed the balcony into two 125-seat each mini-theaters. The 1939-era carbon-arc projectors were replaced with platter-system projectors. The <b>balcony</b> <b>screens</b> received an ultrastereo sound system, while Dolby was used for the downstairs screens. The theater owners installed a café in the upstairs area and elevators. New paint in gray and blue was applied to the interior. On May 15, 1986, the renovated theater re-opened.|$|R

50|$|At {{the time}} of construction, {{it was the largest}} theatre in the south of England, a title it still holds. In the early days, many shows were transported by train. The theatre's {{proximity}} to Southampton Central railway station made its location ideal, but meant that many shows were not as spectacular as their London counterparts. The theatre suffered in early days, to the arrival of cinema, with sound or 'talkies'. This led to the 1933 installation of a projection box in the <b>balcony</b> and a <b>screen,</b> which could be raised and lowered {{at the front of the}} stage. By 1942, the theatre was mainly used as a cinema and was taken over by The Gaumont British Picture Corporation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{architect}} leveraged {{high ceilings}} {{and rows of}} numerous large windows to harness sunlight and increase ventilation, thus avoiding the cost of more expensive decorative adornments. [...] The raised placement of the building atop an above-ground basement, paired with the buildings location on a high ridge, enhanced the flow of cross-through breezes. [...] The tall stature of the building emphasized ventilation, which was considered {{as a method of}} combating airborne illnesses and increase the spirits of the critically ill and dying who inhabited the facilities.

40|$|Heritage {{buildings}} {{serve their}} function as city landmarks {{and as a}} tangible witness of particular city history. The architecture of a city grow simultaneously and show their adaptation to their surroundings to meet people’s needs. Balcony and jalousie represent form of adaptation of Dutch Colonial style to tropical climates. Balcony is considered as one solution to reduce heat gain and yet it maximizes occupants’ living quality. Balcony provides access to outdoor view and relaxing function. Due to its functions, it is potential to adapt and re-use this architectural element in today’s façade design, in respect to energy efficiency and preserving the local design effort. But in some cases, balcony {{may not be able}} to hinder sunlight and heat it brings in higher angle position as in tropical sun position. To overcome this problem, movable screen device usage can be considered. This paper will look into the potential of <b>balcony</b> and <b>screen</b> device, in form of jalousie, effectiveness in buildings as passive design strategy to meet the balance of heat gain and daylight performance.

50|$|Arthur Higgins {{was born}} in Glebe, Hobart, Tasmania in 1891. He was the {{youngest}} of three brothers, Ernest and Tasman. From a young age, Arthur was introduced to photography and projection by his eldest brother, Ernest. In 1900, Ernest rigged up a projector from his father’s shop's <b>balcony</b> with a <b>screen</b> on a building across the street. Eventually Ernest’s fascination with photography and cinema took him to Sydney where he found work at Cosens Spencer filming newsreels and travelogues. Although Arthur had begun a career in architecture, he chose to join Ernest in Sydney in 1908 to pursue a career in cinematography. From 1911, the brothers would work closely with director Raymond Longford. In 1912, Tasman also moved to Sydney to join his brothers.|$|R

The largest theater features a stage, and has been used for performances. Three of the screens are named after former Bridgton Theaters: The Meserve, The Mayfair, and The Brookside. The Brookside has nautical theming, the Meserve has 1920's theming, and the Mayfair has general Victorian theming. The pub, called the Tannery, is named after the Gibb's Tannery that used to be located on the site. It has a Medieval European theme, with dishes being named after the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail.|$|R
40|$|Several {{significant}} {{studies have}} been made in recent decades toward understanding road traffic noise and its effects on residential balconies. These previous studies have used a variety of techniques such as theoretical models, scale models and measurements on real balconies. The studies have considered either road traffic noise levels within the balcony space or inside an adjacent habitable room or both. Previous theoretical models have used, for example, simplified specular reflection calculations, boundary element methods (BEM), adaptations of CoRTN or the use of Sabine Theory. This paper presents an alternative theoretical model to predict the effects of road traffic noise spatially within the balcony space. The model includes a specular reflection component by calculating up to 10 orders of source images. To account for diffusion effects, a two compartment radiosity component is utilised. The first radiosity compartment is the urban street, represented as a street with building facades on either side. The second radiosity compartment is the balcony space. The model is designed to calculate the predicted road traffic noise levels within the balcony space and is capable of establishing the effect of changing street and <b>balcony</b> geometries. <b>Screening</b> attenuation algorithms are included {{to determine the effects of}} solid balcony parapets and balcony ceiling shields...|$|R

40|$|The {{insertion}} loss and its spectrum {{due to a}} rectangular balcony on a building facade {{in the presence of}} sound reflection and scattering from adjacent balconies were examined using a scale model. The front panel of the <b>balcony</b> dictates the <b>screening</b> performance, while the side walls of the balcony are found to be insignificant. Balconies without a front panel do not provide acoustic protection in the presence of upper balcony reflection, especially for a distant noise source. Sound amplifications are also observed in many cases. In addition, the shapes of the {{insertion loss}} spectra are found to depend on the elevation angle of the balcony. Significant correlations between the A-weighted balcony insertion losses with this angle are found in the absence of upper balcony reflections. With such reflection, an angle defined using the balcony configuration and source position correlates within engineering tolerance to the insertion losses.

50|$|As {{the church}} {{continued}} to grow in use, a series of extensions and alterations {{were added to the}} original building. The most significant extension was that of St Andrew's Chambers, a two story, Gothic Revival building built in a roughly 8.5 meter gap between the original church and the Launceston Mechanics Institute fronting onto St John Street. St Andrew's Chambers housed a number of church utilities including a kitchen, care-takers flat, a Sunday School Hall and commercial chambers. During the construction of Civic Square and subsequent demolition of the mechanics institute building (at the time serving as the Launceston Library) in 1973, the Launceston City Council decided that the then-exposed side walls of St Andrew's Chambers were unsightly and {{the decision was made to}} remove the chambers. City Architect William Clennett was appointed by the council to redesign a new, more 'sympathetic' extension to replace the old chambers. The new chambers, continuing but dividing the original profile of the church into 3 levels contained office space, a kindergarten, choir room, church lounge and a Sunday School Hall on the uppermost level. Construction costs escalated to $111,138 but the new chambers were debt free upon opening in October 1974. Later alterations in 1986 included the addition of a new vestibule, additional seating on the internal <b>balcony</b> and glass <b>screens</b> in the foyer. Addition of sound and lighting equipment was installed in 1996.|$|R
