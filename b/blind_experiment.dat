40|$|Abstract Ð A {{survey of}} recent papers {{published}} {{in a range of}} scientific jour-nals showed that the use of blind methodologies is very rare in the so-called hard sciences. In the physical sciences, no <b>blind</b> <b>experiments</b> were found among the 237 papers reviewed. In the biological sciences, there were 7 <b>blind</b> <b>experiments</b> out of 914 (0. 8 %). There was a higher proportion in the medical sciences, 6 out of 102 (5. 9 %), and in psychology and animal behav-ior, 7 out of 143 (4. 9 %). By far the highest proportion (85. 2 %) was in para-psychology. A survey of science departments in 11 British Universities showed that blind methodologies are neither used nor taught in 22 out of 23 physics and chemistry departments, or in 14 out of 16 biochemistry and mol-ecular biology departments. By contrast, blind methodologies are sometime...|$|R

50|$|Astrologers often {{avoid making}} verifiable predictions, and instead rely on vague {{statements}} that {{let them try}} to avoid falsification. Across several centuries of testing, the predictions of astrology have never been more accurate than that expected by chance alone.

50|$|CAFASP, or the Critical Assessment of Fully Automated Structure Prediction, is a {{large-scale}} <b>blind</b> <b>experiment</b> in protein structure prediction that studies {{the performance of}} automated structure prediction webservers in homology modeling, fold recognition, and ab initio prediction of protein tertiary structures based only on amino acid sequence. The experiment runs once every two years in parallel with CASP, which focuses on predictions that incorporate human intervention and expertise. Compared to related benchmarking techniques LiveBench and EVA, which run weekly against newly solved protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank, CAFASP generates much less data, but {{has the advantage of}} producing predictions that are directly comparable to those produced by human prediction experts.

The 42-entry sample included science articles and biographies of scientists, which were compared for accuracy by anonymous academic reviewers; they found that the average Wikipedia entry contained four errors and omissions, while the average Encyclopædia Britannica entry contained three errors and omissions. The study concluded that Wikipedia and Britannica were comparable in terms of the accuracy of its science entries". Nevertheless, the reviewers had two principal criticisms of the Wikipedia science entries: (i) thematically confused content, without an intelligible structure (order, presentation, interpretation); and (ii) that undue weight is given to controversial, fringe theories about the subject matter.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "blind" [...] (adjective and verb) {{is often}} used to signify a lack of {{knowledge}} of something. For example, a blind date is a date in which the people involved have not previously met; a <b>blind</b> <b>experiment</b> is one in which information is kept from either the experimenter or the participant to mitigate the placebo effect or observer bias. The expression [...] "blind leading the blind" [...] refers to incapable people leading other incapable people. Being blind to something means not understanding or being aware of it. A [...] "blind spot" [...] is an area where someone cannot see: for example, where a car driver cannot see because parts of his car's bodywork are in the way; metaphorically, a topic on which an individual is unaware of their own biases, and therefore of the resulting distortions of their own judgements (see Bias blind spot).|$|E

In a peer-reviewed paper, Gottman shows that for a randomly controlled (but not <b>blinded)</b> <b>experiment,</b> couples attending the workshop were tremendously better off later, as follows:Without the workshop, 70% of couples had lower marital satisfaction relative to before birth (a common finding); 58% of mothers had some symptoms of depression after giving birth.Participation in the workshop resulted in no reduction in marital satisfaction,but only 22% of mothers had depressive symptoms.|$|R
50|$|In <b>blind</b> <b>experiments,</b> {{at least}} some {{information}} is withheld from participants in the experiments (but not the experimenter).

If the expert's conclusions as to which samples represent the best outcome correlates with the patients who received the treatment, this allows the experimenter to have much higher confidence that the treatment is effective.|$|R

5000|$|A {{randomized}} experiment {{would violate}} ethical standards. Suppose {{one wanted to}} investigate the abortion - breast cancer hypothesis, which postulates a causal link between induced abortion and the incidence of breast cancer. In a hypothetical controlled experiment, one would start with a large subject pool of pregnant women and divide them randomly into a treatment group (receiving induced abortions) and a control group (not receiving abortions), and then conduct regular cancer screenings for women from both groups. Needless to say, such an experiment would run counter to common ethical principles. (It would also suffer from various confounds and sources of bias, e.g. {{it would be impossible}} to conduct it as a <b>blind</b> <b>experiment.)</b> The published studies investigating the abortion-breast cancer hypothesis generally start with a group of women who already have received abortions.

40|$|In {{a period}} where {{multiple}} studies focused in questioning the consumer about the best packaging profiles in order to optimize sales in the marketplace, this paper proposes to investigate the effect of texture in a packaging {{in the perception of}} the product taste. Mc Neal and Ji (2003) highlighted the influence of packaging in persuading the consumer, both in the store and during consumption. In fact, the first contact between the consumer and a product in a purchase situation is the visual and the tactile contact. The present work is focused on the consumer’s perceptions of taste when confronted with a textured packaging congruent with the product nature. <b>Blind</b> <b>experiments</b> were performed, where the participants tasted a tutti-frutti juice while they touched a citrus-textured bottle or a non-textured (smooth) bottle.

50|$|This {{experiment}} {{intended to}} show that memory could be transferred chemically. The experiment was repeated with mice, fish, and rats, but it always failed to produce the same results. The perceived explanation was that rather than memory being transferred to the other animals, it was the hormones in the ingested ground animals that changed the behavior. McConnell believed that this was evidence of a chemical basis for memory, which he identified as memory RNA. McConnell's results are now attributed to observer bias. No <b>blinded</b> <b>experiment</b> has ever reproduced his results of 'maze-running'. Subsequent explanations of maze-running enhancements associated with cannibalism of trained planarian worms were that the untrained flatworms were only following tracks left on the dirty glassware rather than absorbing the memory of their fodder.|$|R
5000|$|Human {{observations}} are biased toward confirming the observer's conscious and unconscious expectations and {{view of the}} world; we [...] "see what we expect to see". In psychology, this is called confirmation bias. [...] Since the object of scientific research is the discovery of new phenomena, this bias can and has caused new discoveries to be overlooked. One example is the discovery of x-rays. It can also result in erroneous scientific support for widely held cultural myths, for example the scientific racism that supported ideas of racial superiority in the early 20th century. Correct scientific technique emphasizes careful recording of observations, separating experimental observations from the conclusions drawn from them, and techniques such as blind or double <b>blind</b> <b>experiments,</b> to minimize observational bias.|$|R
30|$|An {{important}} distinction between social experiments and randomized controlled trials that are frequently {{used in the}} fields of medicine and public health is that social experiments rarely make use of double blind or even single blind approaches. In the field of medicine, {{it is well known that}} there can often be a “placebo effect” where subjects benefit from the perception of such a treatment. Although social experiments can also be subject to similar problems, it is often difficult or impossible to keep the subjects and researchers unaware of their treatment status. A related phenomenon, known as the “Hawthorne effect,” refers to the possibility that subjects respond differently to stimuli because they are being observed. 4 The important point is that the inability to conduct double <b>blind</b> <b>experiments,</b> and even the knowledge that a subject is in an experiment can potentially lead to biased estimates of intervention impacts.|$|R
