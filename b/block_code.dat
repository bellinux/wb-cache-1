40|$|Multiple antennas help {{in combating}} the {{destructive}} effects of fading {{as well as}} improve the spectral efficiency of a communication system. Receive diversity techniques like maximal ratio receive combining have been popular means of introducing multiple antennas into communication systems. Space-time <b>block</b> <b>codes</b> present a way of introducing transmit diversity into the communication system with similar complexity and performance as maximal ratio receive combining. In this thesis we study the performance of space-time <b>block</b> <b>codes</b> in Rayleigh fading channel. In particular, the quasi-static assumption on the fading channel is removed to study how the space-time <b>block</b> <b>coded</b> system behaves in fast fading. In this context, the complexity versus performance trade-off for a space-time <b>block</b> <b>coded</b> receiver is studied. As a means to improve the performance of space-time <b>block</b> <b>coded</b> systems concatenation by convolutional codes is introduced. The improvement in the diversity order {{by the introduction of}} convolutional codes into the space-time <b>block</b> <b>coded</b> system is discussed. A general analytic expression for the error performance of a space-time <b>block</b> <b>coded</b> system is derived.
