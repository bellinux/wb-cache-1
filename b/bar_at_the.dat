5|$|A {{spiral galaxy}} is {{organized}} into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward.

Both the Milky Way {{and one of our}} nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.|$|E

Tyler was erroneously {{admitted to the}} Virginia <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> premature age of 19—the admitting judge neglected to ask his age. By this time his father was serving as Governor of Virginia (1808–1811), and the young Tyler started a practice in Richmond, the state capital. In 1813 he purchased Woodburn plantation, and resided there until 1821.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little {{had been changed}} since the 17th century in terms of legal {{education}} or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call to the Bar was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had been called to the <b>Bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Inn transferred to others.|$|E
5|$|Hogg {{was called}} to the <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Michaelmas term in 1817, and often practised law in Northumberland and Durham. He {{frequently}} visited his family, with whom he was then on good terms. His reserved personality {{proved to be a}} hindrance to his career, and he remained dependent on financial assistance from his father. He continued studying Greek, and an article that he wrote on Apuleius was published in the third issue of The Liberal in 1822. A paper that he submitted for the fourth issue was rejected, causing him to resent the editors.|$|E
5|$|Kid Icarus is {{an action}} {{platformer}} with role-playing elements. The player controls the protagonist Pit through two-dimensional levels, which contain monsters, obstacles and items. Pit's primary weapon is a bow with an unlimited supply of arrows {{that can be}} upgraded with three collectable power items: the guard crystal shields Pit from enemies, the flaming arrows hit multiple targets, and the holy bow increases {{the range of the}} arrows. These upgrades will work only if Pit's health is high enough. The game keeps track of the player's score, and increases Pit's health <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of a level if enough points were collected.|$|E

Unloading activities on the coral-fringed Kiriwina dragged on for a fortnight.|$|E

Zoe finds a script belonging to Mike {{which he wrote}} 20 years ago about his decision to give Sarah up for adoption. Zoe uses the script and films it, and Adrian screens it in the SU <b>Bar.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> screening, Sarah discovers the planned adoption and is in turmoil. Mike goes to see Adrian to tell him of the plagiarism. Adrian says that if she sleeps with him, he will not tell the university. Zoe considers Adrian's offer but later claims she would rather be a failure than sleep with him, leading to him failing her project. Zoe then has a brief relationship with Natty (Danny Tennant).|$|E
5|$|After an {{examination}} in May 1723, Murray was accepted into Christ Church, Oxford, having scored {{higher in the}} examination than any other King's Scholar that year. He was admitted as a commoner on 15 June 1723, and matriculated on 18 June; the records say that he came from Bath rather than Perth, because the person recording {{the names of the}} new students was unable to understand his Scottish accent. His older brother James was a barrister in Scotland, and his family decided that a career as a barrister was best for Murray. The Scottish <b>Bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time was overcrowded, which made it difficult for a young barrister to build a reputation, yet qualifying for the English Bar was extremely expensive. Thanks to the patronage of Thomas Foley, 1st Baron Foley, who gave Murray £200 a year to live on, Murray could afford to study at the bar, and became a member of Lincoln's Inn on 23 April 1724.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, British {{warships}} bombarded Dar es Salaam {{and destroyed}} the German wireless station there. By this time, Königsbergs engines required a thorough overhaul, and Looff {{needed to find}} a secluded area where the work could be completed. He settled on the Rufiji Delta, which had recently been surveyed by the survey ship Möwe. On 3 September 1914 at high tide, Königsberg passed over the <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the Rufiji and slowly made her way up the river. Coast watchers were stationed {{at the mouth of}} the river and telegraph lines were run to ensure the Germans would not be surprised by British ships searching for them. Zimmer, who was sending small coastal steamers to resupply Königsberg, observed a British cruiser—Pegasus—patrolling the coast for two weeks. He deduced that the ship would likely have to coal at Zanzibar on Sundays, and so Looff decided to attack the ship in port before he began his overhaul. He considered the action justified, since Britain had rejected a German proposal to keep central Africa neutral according to the Congo Act of 1885.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the crash}} Ana Lucia Cortez is {{an officer in the}} Los Angeles Police Department who becomes pregnant, but loses the baby after being shot by a suspect at a {{burglary}} scene. She spends several months in physical and psychological therapy, and when the suspect is arrested, she refuses to identify him. After his release, she kills him outside a bar. Ana Lucia decides to leave the force and eventually finds work as an airport security guard. She meets Christian Shephard (John Terry) at the airport bar, who asks her to accompany him to Sydney as a bodyguard, however in Sydney the two part ways. Ana Lucia buys a ticket on Oceanic Flight 815 to return to Los Angeles. In a brief flashback in the first season finale, she flirts with Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) at a <b>bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> airport, unaware he is Christian's son. The pair arrange to continue their conversation during the flight. During the flight the plane splits in half, with the two parts crashing on different sides of an island; Ana Lucia is one of the tail section survivors.|$|E
5|$|At their farmlet, {{situated}} {{on the banks of}} the Heathcote River to the south of the town, they had two tennis courts; one asphalt court for use in the winter and one grass court for summer play. Wilding started playing tennis in 1889, at age six, after receiving a racquet from manufacturer Ralph Slazenger. He was first educated at William Wilson's private school for boys in Cranmer Square, where he was captain of the school football team at age 12. Wilding passed his matriculation in 1901 after failing at his first attempt in 1900. He attended a term at the Canterbury University College for six months prior to departing on his seven-week sea voyage to England in July 1902 where he first stayed at a cramming school at Hunstanton before passing his entrance examination for Trinity College, Cambridge University to study law. There he developed his tennis game as a member of the Cambridge University Lawn Tennis Club. In March 1904, during his second year, he became honorary secretary of the club and managed to popularize the game. He visited the 1903 Wimbledon Championships to see former champion Harold Mahony play. Although Wilding did not excel academically he passed the law examination and graduated B.A. in June 1905 after which he returned to New Zealand to join his father's law practice. Finishing his education, he was called to the English <b>Bar</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Inner Temple in June 1906.|$|E
30|$|In {{common design}} practice, the beam {{reinforcement}} ratio A_s,bot /A_s,top usually ranges between 0.5 and 1.0. If the top reinforcement area (A_s,top) exceeds the bottom reinforcement area (A_s,bot) at a beam-column joint, relatively larger flexural compression would be developed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom beam ends {{in order to}} balance the greater flexural tension developed from <b>the</b> top beam <b>bars</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same section. Thus, the compressive stress of <b>the</b> bottom beam <b>bars</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> joint face would be {{greater than that of}} <b>the</b> top beam <b>bars</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> opposite face. In other words, the stress gradient along the bottom bars is larger than that along the top bars in the joint, indicating a relatively severe bond demand for the bottom bars.|$|R
