5|$|Mrs. Puff is SpongeBob's {{paranoid}} driving {{teacher and}} the owner of the town boating school, which is similar to a driver's education facility. She would like nothing more than to pass SpongeBob, as he is her most dedicated and hard-working student, but he routinely panics when he tries to drive a boat and fails every driving test he takes. His failures often result in crashes that lead to mass destruction and endanger Mrs. Puff. While she tries her <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> friendly and patient with her students, Mrs. Puff finds SpongeBob's unintentional recklessness exasperating. She is the long-standing love interest and girlfriend of Mr. Krabs.|$|E
5|$|By September, {{the game}} was still unfinished, and almost every Williams {{programmer}} assisted in meeting the deadline for the AMOA trade show. The evening before the trade show, the arcade cabinets were delivered for display. The developers, however, forgot to create an attract mode—an automated sequence designed to entice an audience to play—for the game, and began working on it that night. Early the next morning, the team created the final EPROM chips for the mode and installed them in cabinets. The chips, however, did not work and the designers made additional attempts to correct the problem. Once the attract mode was operational, Jarvis and the team returned to their homes {{to prepare for the}} show. After the show, the developers expanded the game to allow users to play indefinitely. The display model featured five levels, which the team felt was more than enough because of the game's difficulty. Most Williams employees could not progress past the third level and Jarvis's score of 60,000points seemed unbeatable to them. The developers decided it was <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prepared for players that might exceed their expectations and added more levels that repeated.|$|E

25|$|Machiavelli {{felt that}} his early {{schooling}} {{along the lines}} of a traditional classical education was essentially useless for the purpose of understanding politics. Nevertheless, he advocated intensive study of the past, particularly regarding the founding of a city, which he felt was a key to understanding its later development. Moreover, he studied the way people lived and aimed to inform leaders how they should rule and even how they themselves should live. For example, Machiavelli denies that living virtuously necessarily leads to happiness. And Machiavelli viewed misery as one of the vices that enables a prince to rule. Machiavelli stated that it would be <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> both loved and feared. But since the two rarely come together, anyone compelled to choose will find greater security in being feared than in being loved. In much of Machiavelli's work, it seems that the ruler must adopt unsavory policies {{for the sake of the}} continuance of his regime.|$|E

500|$|Belldandy is {{exceptionally}} kind-hearted, {{even for}} a goddess. She can easily sense other people's emotions and tries her <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> empathetic to all those around her, displaying a combination of [...] "serene beauty and acceptance". She rarely holds a grudge and is always willing to forgive anyone who does injury to her...unless Keiichi is involved of course. Even though Belldandy tries her <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as kind as possible, it is revealed that at times she can become very insecure and sad, especially when she is confronted with an implication that involves Keiichi {{in one way or}} another. This aspect of her character provides one of the biggest plot points in the Ah! My Goddess movie: Belldandy's possessiveness of Keiichi could make her an easy target for manipulation or even brainwashing, if the right buttons were pressed; her jealousy of Morgan Le Fay was what allowed Celestin, her teacher, to lure Belldandy into his plans.|$|E

500|$|Although Brian Epstein's {{publicly}} stated {{reluctance to}} fire Best {{quickly became a}} matter of record in the early biographies, he had found Mona <b>Best</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the cause of mounting aggravation. Epstein's distaste for her interference in the Beatles' management, including her [...] "aggressive opinions about his handling of her son's career", was obvious to everyone, and he also reportedly considered Mona Best a loose cannon who must {{not be allowed to}} interfere in his operations. Moreover, the very recent birth of Roag further complicated matters. Although Best himself was not personally responsible for this development, it would still have caused a grave scandal had it become generally known, and Epstein may have been horrified at the prospect.|$|E

500|$|Of the film's humor, Wilmington {{wrote that}} Leprechaun [...] "isn't {{dumb enough to}} be fun". [...] Hicks {{described}} the film's humor as [...] "ill-advised slapstick", and Canby wrote that it is [...] "neither scary nor funny". [...] Berardinelli called the leprechaun's one-liners [...] "more idiotic than pithy". [...] Writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, critic Jeff Makos unfavorably compared the film's tone to that of Tremors, which he posited as an influence. [...] Makos said Davis does his <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> funny, but the film has no funny jokes, making audience feedback probably more entertaining than the film itself. [...] The use of Lucky Charms as humor also received commentary. [...] Harrington wrote that Jones is [...] "so bereft of inventive ideas that he refers to Lucky Charms cereal not once but three times", and Bourjaily criticized the Lucky Charms jokes as unfunny.|$|E
500|$|However, Burton {{dropped out}} of Mary Reilly over Columbia's {{decision}} to fast track the film and their interest with Julia Roberts {{in the title role}} instead of Ryder. This prompted Burton to becoming interested in directing Ed Wood himself, on the understanding it could be done quickly. Lehmann said, [...] "Tim wanted to do this movie immediately and direct, but I was already committed to Airheads." [...] Lehmann was given executive producer credit. Alexander and Karaszewski delivered a 147-page screenplay in six weeks. Burton read the first draft and immediately agreed to direct the film as it stood, without any changes or rewrites. Ed Wood gave Burton the opportunity to make a film that was more character-driven as opposed to style-driven. He said in an interview, [...] "On a picture like this I find you don't need to storyboard. You're working mainly with actors, and there's no effects going on, so it's <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more spontaneous." ...|$|E

In 1975, at a televised game versus the University of Arkansas, the Aggie Band was repeatedly asked to play music during lulls in the game. By the fourth quarter, the Aggie Band had played on TV during every break and Colonel Haney, trying his <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fair, told the cameraman that they really should let the Razorback Band play a little too.
