5|$|Upon being {{confirmed}} in the Catholic Church in 1966, she adopted Veronica as a confirmation name. She {{was raised in}} the Detroit suburbs of Pontiac and Avon Township (now Rochester Hills). Months before her mother died of breast cancer at age 30 on December 1, 1963, Madonna noticed changes in her behavior and personality, although she did not understand the reason. Her mother was at a loss to explain her medical condition, and often <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> when Madonna questioned her about it. Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying.|$|E
5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, you <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> {{because you could}} not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

25|$|Hājar soon {{ran out of}} water, and Ismā'īl, {{an infant}} by that time, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> from hunger/thirst. Hājar panicked and ran between two nearby hills, Al-Safa and Al-Marwah, {{repeatedly}} in search for water. After her seventh run, an angel appeared over {{the location of the}} Zamzam and then hit the ground with his heel (or his wing) and caused a miraculous well to spring out of the ground. This is called the Zamzam Well and is located a few metres from the Kaaba in Mecca.|$|E
25|$|Beck and Fernandez {{traveled}} to Byron Center Road in Wyoming Township, Michigan, {{a suburb of}} Grand Rapids, where they met and stayed with Delphine Downing, a young widow with a two-year-old daughter. On February 28, Downing became agitated, and Fernandez gave her sleeping pills to calm her. The daughter witnessed Downing's resulting stupor and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> which enraged Beck. Panicked, Beck choked the child but didn't kill her. Fernandez thought Downing would become suspicious if she saw her bruised daughter, so he shot the unconscious woman. The couple then stayed for several days in Downing's house. Again enraged by the daughter's crying, Beck drowned her in a basin of water. They buried the bodies in the basement, but suspicious neighbors reported the Downings' disappearances, leading the police {{to arrive at the}} door on March 1, 1949 and arrest Beck and Fernandez.|$|E

25|$|According to some sources, on {{the morning}} of her death, she took a bath, put on new clothes and lay down in bed. She asked for Ali and {{informed}} him that her time to die was very close. Upon hearing this news, Ali <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> but was consoled by Fatimah who asked him to look after her two sons and for him to bury her without ceremony. It is further stated that her two sons were the first family members to learn of her death and immediately proceeded to the mosque to inform their father. Upon hearing the news, Ali fell unconscious. After recovering he followed Fatima's wishes and performed the janazah. He buried her during the night on 13 Jumada al-awwal 11AH (632 AD), also making three false graves to ensure her real grave could not be identified. With him were his family and a few of his close companions. After her death, Ali followed her wishes and buried her without informing the Medinan people.|$|E

Kennedy's attention was drawn to a 20 month-old boy who was playing with rice grains on the floor. The child was covered in sores and bloated from hunger. Kennedy knelt down and stroked his cheek. He said, [...] "My God, I didn't know {{this kind of thing}} existed. How can a country like this allow it? Maybe they just don't know." [...] Clark labeled what lay before them a [...] "national disgrace." [...] Kennedy caressed the child and talked to him, but elicited no response. The senator <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b>|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller {{received}} a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton. British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, [...] "I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and {{talking to me about}} the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things". He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.|$|E
500|$|The {{author was}} further {{prompted}} {{to write about}} grace when a friend told him about encountering a homeless prostitute in Chicago who <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> as {{she told him that}} she had raised money for drugs by prostituting her two-year-old child. When Yancey's friend asked the woman if she had sought help at a local church, she answered, [...] "Church? Why would I ever go there? I was already feeling terrible about myself. They'd just make me feel worse." [...] This story convinced Yancey that Christians are doing a poor job of communicating the message that God is willing to accept people, regardless of what they have done; the story haunted him, he said, because the woman was [...] "the type of person who would have gone to Jesus. The more unrighteous a person was, the more comfortable they felt around Jesus".|$|E
500|$|During {{production}} of the first anime adaptation, the author often visited the TMS Entertainment studio, where the voice actors requested advice about their characters. Although Hoshino was nervous about talking with them, she was surprised by their dedication in practising their characters—particularly Sanae Kobayashi (Allen), Takahiro Sakurai (Kanda), Katsuyuki Konishi (Komui), and Hiroki Tōchi (Cross Marian)—and joked that Lenalee seemed more beautiful after she saw Shizuka Itō's work. Early in production, Hoshino was shown {{an early version of}} the first opening theme: [...] "Innocent Sorrow" [...] by the Japanese rock band Abingdon Boys School. When she saw the video, Hoshino <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> in delight while the staff laughed to her. Tyki Mikk's voice actor, Toshiyuki Morikawa, remembered the recording sessions for the series as [...] "lively" [...] {{because of the presence of}} many popular actors. After the anime finished, the actors (who became friends during production) kept in touch.|$|E

500|$|News of Arthur's death reached Henry VII's court late on 4 April. The King was awoken {{from his}} sleep by his confessor, who quoted Job by asking Henry [...] "If we receive good {{things at the}} hands of God, why may we not endure evil things?" [...] He then told the king that [...] " [...] dearest son hath {{departed}} to God," [...] and Henry burst into tears. [...] "Grief-stricken and emotional," [...] he then had his wife brought into his chambers, so that they might [...] "take the painful news together"; Elizabeth reminded Henry that God had helped him become king and [...] "had ever preserved him," [...] adding that they had been left with [...] "yet a fair Prince and two fair princesses and that God is where he was, and [...] both young enough."

500|$|Hamza was {{captured}} in the battle {{as well as his}} staff. Francesco Sansovino, in Historia universale dell'origine et imperio de'Turchi, states that Hamza, [...] fearing punitive measures, begged for mercy, arguing that he had only fought against Skanderbeg since he had been ordered to. According to Demetrio Franco, one of Skanderbeg's earliest biographers, Skanderbeg responded {{in such a way that}} the Ottoman officers <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> and he offered to have dinner with them. After this, he ordered for his prisoners to be put under guard and to be treated properly. The men were freed in the end, but Hamza and his staff were ransomed for 13,000 ducats. Franco reports that Skanderbeg's magnanimity became known throughout Albania and the Ottoman Empire to the point where many of his men gained much more respect for him as a warrior. Skanderbeg's intention in doing so was to show that he would not take advantage of the unfortunate and that he had enough confidence in his ability to let his enemies fight him again another day.|$|E

[...] Parsons had spoken with friends and was apparently worried that Kent had been busy with his own investigations. [...] Instead, he allowed Elizabeth to be moved that night to St Bartholomew's Hospital, where another séance was held. [...] Nothing was reported until about 6am, when three scratches were heard, apparently while the girl was asleep. [...] The approximately 20-strong audience complained that the affair was a deception. [...] Once Elizabeth woke she <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry,</b> and once reassured that she was safe admitted that she was afraid for her father, [...] "who must needs be ruined and undone, if their matter should be {{supposed to be an}} imposture." [...] She also admitted that although she had appeared to be asleep, she was in fact fully aware of the conversation going on around her.|$|E

500|$|Tatiana and {{her older}} sister, Olga, were {{known in the}} {{household}} as [...] "The Big Pair." [...] According to a 29 May 1897 diary entry written by her father's distant cousin, Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia, she was given the name [...] "Tatiana" [...] as an homage to the heroine in Alexander Pushkin's novel in verse Eugene Onegin. Her father {{liked the idea of}} having daughters named Olga and Tatiana, like the sisters in the famous poem. Like their two younger sisters, the two older girls shared a bedroom and were very close to one another from early childhood. In the spring of 1901, Olga had typhoid fever and was confined to the nursery for several weeks away from her younger sisters. When she began to recover, Tatiana was permitted to see her older sister for five minutes but didn't recognize her. When her governess, Margaretta Eagar, told her after the visit that the sickly child she had been conversing so gently with was Olga, four-year-old Tatiana <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> bitterly and protested that the pale, thin child couldn't be her adored older sister. Eagar had difficulty persuading Tatiana that Olga would recover. French tutor Pierre Gilliard wrote that the two sisters were [...] "passionately devoted to one another." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, video games, {{and other}} related media have commented on Shikamaru's character. IGN stated that Shikamaru {{was one of their}} favorite characters in the series, and referred to him as [...] "the poster child for any card-carrying member of Generation X" [...] due to his general lack of enthusiasm and his unwillingness to utilize his potential. In a review of episode 110, IGN praised how Shikamaru managed to transcend his lazy nature in order to take on the mantle of a leader when assigned to lead a team in order to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha and agreed that the decision to make him Chunin was fair. Anime News Network also commented on this development, calling Shikamaru's emergence as [...] "an unlikely hero" [...] {{one of the highlights of}} the arc. In a subsequent review of episode 135, in which the mission to retrieve Sasuke has failed and the members of Shikamaru's team were critically injured, IGN lauded the [...] "great moment" [...] in the episode in which Shikamaru <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> after learning his friends will recover, and declared that he will be a better leader for the sake of his friends. Mania Entertainment's Justin Rich celebrated his [...] "sheer intellect", calling him [...] "one of the most fascinating characters in the series" [...] and [...] "one of the few truly brilliant fighters in shōnen anime". Dani Moure, another reviewer from the same site, noted about his battle with Temari during the Chunin Exams that it was [...] "one of the better fights involving the supporting players".|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{was born}} in war-time England, on 9 October 1940, at Liverpool Maternity Hospital, to Julia (née Stanley) and Alfred Lennon. His father was a {{merchant}} seaman of Irish descent who was away {{at the time of}} his son's birth. His parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal grandfather, John [...] "Jack" [...] Lennon, and Prime Minister Winston Churchill. His father was often away from home but sent regular pay cheques to 9Newcastle Road, Liverpool, where Lennon lived with his mother; the cheques stopped when he went absent without leave in February 1944. When he eventually came home six months later, he offered to look after the family, but Julia—by then pregnant with another man's child—rejected the idea. After her sister Mimi complained to Liverpool's Social Services twice, Julia gave her custody of Lennon. In July 1946, Lennon's father visited her and took his son to Blackpool, secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia followed them—with her partner at the time, 'Bobby' Dykins—and after a heated argument his father forced the five-year-old to choose between them. Lennon twice chose his father, but as his mother walked away, he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry</b> and followed her, although this has been disputed. According to author Mark Lewisohn, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home as Alf left again. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said the dramatic scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon having to make a decision between his parents never happened. It would be 20 years before he had contact with his father again.|$|E
