50|$|The liquid {{ventilator}} removes Carbon dioxide (CO2) {{from the}} PFC by saturating it with oxygen (O2) and medical air. This procedure {{can be performed}} with either a membrane oxygenator (a technology used in extracorporeal oxygenators) or a <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenator.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenator</b> is {{an early}} {{implementation}} of the oxygenator used for cardiopulmonary bypass.

5000|$|The {{oxygenator}} {{is designed}} to add oxygen to infused blood and {{remove some of the}} carbon dioxide from the venous blood. Cardiac surgery was made possible by CPB using <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenators,</b> but membrane <b>oxygenators</b> have supplanted <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenators</b> since the 1980s. The main reasons for this are that membrane oxygenators tend to generate much fewer micro bubbles, referred to as gaseous microemboli, which is generally considered harmful to the patient [...] and reduce damage to blood cells, compared to <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenators.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, {{microporous}} membrane oxygenators were developed, {{and replaced}} <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenators</b> in most applications.|$|R
50|$|The {{oxygenator}} {{was first}} conceptualized in the 17th century by Robert Hooke and developed into practical extracorporeal oxygenators by French and German experimental physiologists in the 19th century. <b>Bubble</b> <b>oxygenators</b> have no intervening barrier between blood and oxygen, these are called 'direct contact' oxygenators. Membrane oxygenators introduce a gas-permeable membrane between blood and oxygen that decreases the blood trauma of direct-contact oxygenators. Much work since the 1960s focused on overcoming the gas exchange handicap of the membrane barrier, {{leading to the}} development of high-performance microporous hollow-fibre oxygenators that eventually replaced direct-contact oxygenators in cardiac theatres.|$|R
50|$|The device faced {{competition}} from membrane oxygenators, which arrived {{within the same}} decade and were found to provide better oxygenation for periods over eight hours, and other advantages beyond six hours. However, most open-heart operations were substantially shorter, and by 1976 the <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenator</b> was predominant.|$|E
50|$|Leland Clark (Professor of Chemistry, Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio, and Fels Research Institute, Yellow Springs, Ohio) had {{developed}} the first <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenator</b> {{for use in}} cardiac surgery.

40|$|The {{oxygenator}} membrane for {{oxygen and}} carbon dioxide exchange has a very low diffusion resistance, whereby the direct contact between gas and blood as in <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenators</b> or in pore membrane oxygenators is avoided.

In the <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenator</b> group, significant leukocyte and platelet right to left atrium gradients were found 15 minutes after lung reperfusion (p < 0. 05, p < 0. 01) accompanied by a sharp increase in plasma malondialdehyde concentration 5 minutes after lung reperfusion, whereas no significant right to left atrium gradient of leukocytes or platelets nor significant increase in plasma malondialdehyde concentration was observed in the membrane oxygenator group. In both the <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenator</b> and membrane oxygenator group, similar mild to moderate lung histological changes were found before lung reperfusion. After lung reperfusion, however, more endothelial cell swelling (p < 0. 05), leukocyte (p < 0. 01) and platelet (p < 0. 01) accumulation in lung capillaries, leakage of erythrocytes into the alveolar space (p < 0. 05), and type I cell damage (p < 0. 05) were found only in the <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenator</b> group. Eventually, a significantly higher lung water content was found in the <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenator</b> group than in the membrane oxygenator group (p < 0. 01) after cardiopulmonary bypass.

40|$|To compare new flat-sheet and hollow-fiber {{membrane}} oxygenators {{for use in}} cardiopulmonary bypass, we randomly divided 40 {{coronary artery}} surgery patients into 2 groups of 20 patients each.

Both oxygenators allowed for adequate transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide. At the end of perfusion, the platelet counts were significantly lower and the arterial pH significantly higher in the Shiley group than in the Bentley group. The other hematologic parameters, as well as postoperative blood losses, were similar in the 2 groups, but were also similar to those reported earlier with respect to <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenators.</b> On the basis of these results, we conclude that, for routine short-term perfusion, these new membrane oxygenator models, while marginally different from one another, offer no real advantage over bubble models.

However, there is little information available evaluating the MO for routine, short-term cardiopulmonary bypass. In this study the 5 MO 314 Modulung-Teflo (MO) was compared to 5 M 30314 Miniprime Variflo (BO). The data of 91 patients (46 MO and 45 BO) were analyzed according to the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (Group I less than 60 min., Group II 60 - 90 min. and Group III greater than 90 min.). Hemodynamic parameters, fluid and blood balance, as well as hematologic and blood gas studies were used for comparing the two oxygentors. The hemodynamic parameters were better, and the arterial blood gases were more physilogic with the MO. The postoperative blood loss was significantly less when using the MO.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: Recent {{studies suggest}} that {{myocardial}} reperfusion injury is exacerbated by free radicals when pure oxygen is used during cardiopulmonary bypass. Partial replacement of the oxygenator gas mixture with nitrogen, however, such as has already been adopted clinically in many centers, could {{increase the risk of}} gaseous nitrogen microembolus formation and therefore of brain damage because of the low solubility of nitrogen, particularly under conditions of hypothermia. Methods: Ten 7 - to 10 -kg piglets were cooled for 30 minutes to 15 Â°C on cardiopulmonary bypass and then rewarmed for 40 minutes to 37 Â°C. In 5 piglets cardiopulmonary bypass was normoxic and in 5 it was hyperoxic. In each group 3 bubble oxygenators without arterial filters and 2 membrane oxygenators with filters were used. Cerebral microemboli were monitored continuously by carotid Doppler ultrasonography (8 MHz) and intermittently by fluorescence retinography. Results: Embolus count was greater with lower rectal temperature (P <. 001), use of a <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenator</b> (P <. 001), and lower oxygen concentration (P =. 021) but was not affected by the temperature gradient between blood and body during cooling or rewarming. Conclusions: Gaseous microemboli are increased with normoxic perfusion, but this is only important if a <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenator</b> without a filter is used.

30|$|We {{recognize}} that intermittent hemodialysis conditions are {{not designed for}} treatment longer {{than a few hours}} and a single-pass dialysate may lead to loss of essential minerals, micro-nutrients, hormones, and drugs from the plasma. To prevent this, a less permeable dialyzer could be used or the dialysate could be recycled in a closed loop. The closed loop approach would use a secondary CO 2 removal device, such as a <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenator</b> or membrane lung, to remove CO 2 from the dialysate post-dialyzer and drive the bicarbonate concentration back down towards zero. This approach would be attractive because it would recycle the dialysate and reduce cost. Work on dialysate recirculation by Zanella, previously described, demonstrates therapeutic CO 2 removal rates and demonstrates that dialysate recirculation for respiratory hemodialysis is possible.|$|E
40|$|Typically, {{blood loss}} after {{operations}} requiring cardiopulmonary bypass is estimated from {{the sum of}} blood on sponges and drapes, in the suction system reservoir, and in chest drainage bottles. Prime of the extracorporeal circuit is usually returned to the patient, but no accounting is made of blood remaining in the circuit. In 50 patients, we examined 25 bubble and 25 membrane oxygenator circuits after completion of cardiopulmonary bypass and after return of all prime to the patients. Saline solution was added to each circuit and recirculated for 3 minutes, after which the volume and hematocrit of the recirculated saline were determined. From these values, we estimated that 92. 0 +/- 18. 1 mL of red blood cells remained in the <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenators</b> and 100 +/- 11. 6 mL in the membrane oxygenators. This volume of red cells is equivalent to 250 mL of whole blood with 35 % hematocrit or 30 grams of hemoglobin at 12 gm% concentration. We conclude that blood loss after operations requiring cardiopulmonary bypass is systematically underestimated by the approximately 250 mL left as red cells {{on the walls and}} filters of the extracorporeal circuit after return of all prime to the patient...|$|R

Haemocompatibility was evaluated by measurement of platelet numbers and function, betathromboglobulin (BTG), plasma haemoglobin, complement (C 3 a des Arg) and white blood cell (WBC) count pre- and post-CPB. Platelet and WBC numbers were also measured every five minutes throughout CPB. All oxygenators allowed the perfusionist to control blood gases adequately to prescribed levels. There were only minor differences in the degree and pattern of platelet depletion, reduction in platelet aggregation, elevation of BTG and C 3 a des Arg observed between oxygenator groups, which {{did not appear to}} be influenced by membrane type (flat plate versus hollow fibre).

40|$|An {{essential}} {{feature of}} cardio-pulmonary by-pass is {{the provision of}} adequate cerebral perfusion during open heart surgery. Although various methods exist for measuring cerebral blood flow, they involve the exposure and possible transection of major cerebral vascular channels and are therefore limited to the experimental field.

Furthermore, this form of C 3 was found to be susceptible to cleavage by factor I.

30|$|Oxygenator: {{there are}} two types of oxygenator; <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenators,</b> which are used for {{perioperative}} extracorporeal circulation during heart surgery, and membrane oxygenators, which avoid hemolysis associated with bubbling [25, 26]. Only membrane oxygenators are used for peripheral ECMO. There are two types of membrane: flat and tubular [28]. The former have flat silicone membranes or membranes assembled in layers. Oxygenators with tubular membranes comprising nonporous hollow fibers generally made of polymethylpentene avoid loss of plasma components. The oxygenator should be located downstream of the pump and permit gas exchange by artificially reproducing the function of the alveolar capillary membrane. It also ensures heat exchange and warms the blood of the extracorporeal circuit [25]. It has an inlet and an outlet and is connected to a gas mixer, which is used to adjust the oxygen fraction delivered by the extracorporeal circuit (FECO 2) and the gas flow (sweep gas rate). Oxygenators are tested for measurement of pressure as a function of flow rates. The pressure gradient generated by the passage of the blood through the oxygenator should be lower than 50 Â mmHg/L/minute. The pressure drop corresponds to the transmembrane pressure gradient. Treatment goals distinguish oxygenation and decarboxylation. Membrane performance is evaluated by the rated flow of the oxygenator which corresponds to the amount of desaturated (75 %) venous blood that can be nearly fully saturated (95 %) in a given time. The flow rate is adjusted to that of the assist system. Most oxygenators support sweep flow rates of 10 Â mL/minute to 100 Â L/minute [25]. The oxygenator should be placed below the level of the patient. The gas outlet port should be directed downwards to limit the risk of obstruction [25].|$|R

30|$|During {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass (CPB) procedures, it {{is necessary}} to maintain physiological levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. To do this, the patient is connected to a blood-gas exchange device (commonly known as a blood oxygenator) which replaces the respiratory function of the natural lungs. Such devices have a relatively long history, {{and by the end of}} the nineteenth century two different methods of organ perfusion had been developed: von SchrÃ¶der [1] designed a <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenator</b> in 1882 while in 1885 von Frey and Grubber [2] developed a rotating disc oxygenator. However, probably the first successful device was created by Gibbon [3] who in 1939 produced a vertical screen oxygenator, a variant of which was eventually employed in the first successful clinical cardiopulmonary bypass procedure in 1953 [4]. However, there was general agreement that direct contact between the gas and blood phases, which occurred in these devices, was not conducive to prolonged use surgically. Thus with the advent of polydimethysiloxane (silicon rubber), membrane oxygenators were constructed, initially using a parallel plate configuration, with alternating layers of blood and oxygen, separated by a semi-permeable membrane.|$|E

The capacity for fentanyl uptake by membrane oxygenators from these three categories was studied in vitro. Representative membrane samples were incubated in solutions containing tritiated fentanyl in Normosol-R (Abbott, North Chicago, IL) with pH adjusted to 7. 4 at 37 [deg]C. Fentanyl analysis was performed using liquid scintillation and radioimmunoassay techniques. The uptake of fentanyl at various concentrations (340 to 10 ng/mL) was studied.

40|$|The {{membrane}} oxygenator {{is known}} to be superior to the <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenator,</b> but little information is available about the difference between the hollow fiber and flat sheet membrane oxygenators with regard to pressure drop, shear stress, and leukocyte activation. In this study, we compared these 2 types of membrane oxygenators in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery with special focus on leukocyte activation and pressure drop across the oxygenators. Plasma concentration of elastase, a marker indicating leukocyte activation, increased to 593 +/- 68 % in the flat sheet oxygenator group versus 197 +/- 42 % in the hollow fiber oxygenator group (p < 0. 01) at the end of CPB compared to their respective baseline concentrations before CPB. Pressure drop across the oxygenator was significantly higher in the flat sheet group than in the hollow fiber group throughout the entire period of CPB (p < 0. 01). High pressure drop across the oxygenator as well as the calculated shear stress was positively correlated with the release of elastase at the end of CPB (r = 0. 760, p < 0. 01, r = 0. 692, p < 0. 01). However, this positive correlation existed in the flat sheet oxygenator but not in the hollow fiber oxygenator.

Hypothermia was induced by incorporating a heat-exchange mechanism in pump-oxygenator system and total circulatory arrest was maintained for from 3 to 50 minutes after esophageal temperaure {{had been reduced to}} the range of 5 â„ƒ to 17 â„ƒ. Rewarming followed by circulatory arrest was discontinued at about 36 â„ƒ of esophageal temperature. Two types of pump-oxygenator, bubble and Kay-Anderson, were used and their advantages were compared. Poor recovery of electroencephalogram and brain damage were found even in many cases where perfusion time for cooling and rewarming is relatively short, ranging from 45 to 55 minutes, in bubble type group. These changes were found more frequently and much more exaggerated in proportion to increase of total perfusion time. Brain damage considered referable to perfusion per se was found only where duration of perfusion extended over 89 minutes in Kay-Anderson group. Perfusion less than 80 minutes is cnosidered safe in this type of oxygenator. Changes of temperature in the jugular vein and brain surface were very closed and the difference between those and esophageal temperature was around 8 â„ƒ at the maximum when the latter was aronnd 10 â„ƒ and it decreased slightly at the end of cooling. The three closely approximated at around 20 â„ƒ on rewarming and the gradient between the former two and the latter became maximum at around 30 â„ƒ (esophageal) and it decreased at the end of rewarming. There was found gradient in temperature between brain core and brain surface and the former was closed to esphageal temperature and the latter colosed to temperature in the jugular vein. No marked difference in electric brain activity was noted between the cases with and without additional perfusion during circulatory arrest. It is anticipated that circulatory arrest of 30 minutes duration cause no harmful effect on brain when brain temperature was below 20 â„ƒ. Esophageal temperature rose regularly compared to temperatue in the jugular vein or brain surface during circulatory arrest. The rapidity of temperature drift was in order of esophagus, brain and jugular vein. At first, decrease in amplitude was noted on cooling, though decrease in frequency was minumum, in electroephalographic changes. Occasionally, reactivation of electroencephalogram was found in spite of general tendency toward flattening, in the coures of cooling. The same phenomenon was observed occasionally after circulatory arrest, though electroencephalogram disappeared compleltely ten minutes after arrest. On rewarming, electroencephalogram reappared at 20 â„ƒ, which is about 3 â„ƒ higher in average temperature when it disappeared on cooling. Changes in electroencephalogram on rewarming was not consistent. Burst at first and then increase in frequency were noted in some cases. and wave of low voltage at first, secondly rapid increase of frequency and then gradual increase of amplitude were noted in another cases. Occasionally, suppression of electroencephalogram recurred after esophageal temperature reached to over 30 â„ƒ, Decrease in both frequency and amplitude of brain waves were generally noted in most caces at the end of rewarming and return of amplitude to the initial level usually lagged behind that of frequency. Brain damage was found in cases where recovery of brain was poor when examination was performed 20 minutes or more later after completion of the experiment, though it was sometimes unsuccessful to detect brain damage where examination was done earlier than 20 minutes. Brain damage was found mostly in the cortical area of the brain and occasionally in nucleus and brain stem. There were few cases where brain damage was found despite of good recovery in brain acivity. No changes were noted usually in cortical area in those cases and minimum when existed, too. It is remarkable that good recovery of brain activity in electroencephalogram does not always guarantee absense of brain damage. Estimation of the activity of succinic dehydrogenase is considered an excellent method for detection of brain damage, because it makes passible to disclose changes in brain tissue in early period after their occurrence. <b>Bubble</b> type <b>oxygenator</b> is considered disadvantageous to profound hypothermia with rapid blood cooling...|$|R
40|$|THE NOW {{fairly common}} use of extra-corporeal cireulation has {{resulted}} in a large group of patients who have been sub-jected to the hazards of multiple blood trans-fusions. It is somewhat surprising that a greater incidence of viral diseases has not been noted in the patients who survive those procedures. Kreel et al. 1 studied 20 patients after successful open-heart surgery utilizing a <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenator,</b> and described a post-perfusion syndrome which included anemia, leukocytosis, hematuria, albuminuria, and fever. In six of their patients, atypical lym-phocytes, similar to those seen in infectious mononucleosis, appeared in the peripheral blood smears, and in one patient splenomegaly and elevation of the heterophile antibody titer subsequently developed. Wheeler et al. 2 re-ported an unusual syndrome characterized by fever, splenomegaly, and atypical lymphocytes occurring in patients after an open-heart operation in which a rotating disk-type oxy-genator was used. This syndrome was seen in 6 of 54 patients who survived open-heart operations during one year, an incidence of 11 per cent. An elevation of the heterophile antibody titer was not found in these patients. The syndrome appeared three to seven weeks after operation, followed a benign course lasting one to three weeks, and required no specific therapy. An infectious viral etiology was suggested. In the first 170 consecutive patients who survived open-heart operation at The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, a syn-drome similar to that described by Kreel et al. and Wheeler et al. was seen in 14 patients (table 1), an incidence of 8 per cent. In all eases, a rotating disk-type oxygenator wa...|$|E
40|$|Ventricular {{fibrillation}} wns {{induced by}} electric shock in both closed- and open-chest animals. Total body perfusion {{was provided by}} extracorporeal circulation with a <b>bubble</b> <b>oxygenator.</b> The failure of left heart pressure to increase during prolonged observations indicates the probable competency of the aortic valve and retrograde flow of bronchial arterial blood to the right heart. Evidence for left-to-right flow is shown by reciprocal pressures in parallel chambers, by recovery of isotope in the pulmonary artery following left heart and aortic injection and by a cardiopneumonogram. The existence of a. com-mon mean pressure in the left heart, lungs and right heart during ventricular fibrillation confirms {{the hypothesis that the}} central circulation is in essence a system of tubes per-mitting the passive transfer of blood with the prevailing gradient. SINCE ventricular fibrillation occurringspontaneously or experimentally is gen-erally an acute phenomenon, few deliberate studies of the central circulation had beeu made prior to the availability of pump oxy-genators. Tinder the circumstance of total body perfusion and induced ventricular fibrillation, systematic investigation of the hemodynamic adjustment of the cardiac and pulmonary circulation is possible. t"s This investigation M'as undertaken to de-termine the blood flow pattern existing in the cardiopulmonai"} ' circuit when the pro-pulsive action of both ventricles had ceased and extracorporeal function substituted. Be-cause of the great change in pressure gradi-ents at the onset of ventricular fibrillation, a complete reversal of normal antegrade flow is possible. During studies with deliberate prolonged ventricular fibrillation supported with the pump oxygenator, it was noted that left heart dynamics closely paralleled induced changes in the right heart. 4 Thus with a steady mean pressure in the right atrium the left atria...|$|E
