The inverse relationship between the past 30 -min interval order imbalance and current stock return in both pre- and post-devaluation of baht indicates that aggregate investors are contrarians. During the currency crisis, aggregate investors are less contrarian compared to the pre-devaluation period. Moreover, excess sell orders have a stronger impact to future return than to the excess <b>buy</b> <b>orders.</b> During the financial crisis, future stock returns are sensitive {{to an increase in}} current excess sell orders, but are insensitive to the current excess <b>buy</b> <b>orders.</b> In addition to the positive volume-volatility relation, the influence of order imbalance to volatility is much weaker after controlling for the level of stock returns. ...|$|R

40|$|In 1964, G. J. Stigler {{introduced}} a stochastic {{model for the}} evolution of an order book on a stock market. This model was independently rediscovered and generalized by H. Luckock in 2003. In his formulation, traders place buy and sell limit orders of unit size according to independent Poisson processes with possibly different intensities. Newly arriving <b>buy</b> (sell) <b>orders</b> are either immediately matched to the best available matching sell (<b>buy)</b> <b>order</b> or stay in the order book until a matching order arrives. Assuming stationarity, Luckock showed that the distribution functions of the best <b>buy</b> and sell <b>order</b> in the order book solve a differential equation, from which he was able to calculate the position of two prices J^ c_-<J^ c_+ such that <b>buy</b> <b>orders</b> below J^ c_- and sell orders above J^ c_+ stay in the order book forever while all other orders are eventually matched. We extend Luckock's model by adding market orders, i. e., with a certain rate traders arrive at the market that take the best available buy or sell offer in the order book, if there is one, and do nothing otherwise. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for such an extended model to be positive recurrent and show how these conditions are related to the prices J^ c_- and J^ c_+ of Luckock.

40|$|In {{this comment}} {{we discuss the}} problem of {{reconciling}} the linear efficiency of price returns with the long-memory of supply and demand. We present new evidence that shows that efficiency is maintained by a liquidity imbalance that co-moves with the imbalance of buyer vs. seller initiated transactions. For example, during a period where there is an excess of buyer initiated transactions, there is also more liquidity for <b>buy</b> <b>orders</b> than sell <b>orders,</b> so that <b>buy</b> <b>orders</b> generate smaller and less frequent price responses than sell orders. At the moment a <b>buy</b> <b>order</b> is placed the transaction sign imbalance tends to dominate, generating a price impact. However, the liquidity imbalance rapidly increases with time, so that after {{a small number of}} time steps it cancels all the inefficiency caused by the transaction sign imbalance, bounding the price impact. While the view presented by Bouchaud et al. of a fixed and temporary bare price impact is self-consistent and formally correct, we argue that viewing this in terms of a variable but permanent price impact provides a simpler and more natural view. This is {{in the spirit of the}} original conjecture of Lillo and Farmer, but generalized to allow for finite time lags in the build up of the liquidity imbalance after a transaction. We discuss the possible strategic motivations that give rise to the liquidity imbalance and offer an alternative hypothesis. We also present some results that call into question the statistical significance of large swings in expected price impact at long times. ...|$|R

40|$|We analyse order {{placement}} strategies in a limit order market, using {{data on the}} order flow from the Stockholm Stock Exchange. Traders submitting market or limit orders trade off the order price against both the execution probability and the winner’s curse risk associated with different order choices. The optimal order strategy {{is characterized by a}} monotone function, which maps the liquidity demand of the investors into their order choice. We develop and implement a semiparametric test of this monotonicity property, and find no evidence against the monotonicity property for <b>buy</b> <b>orders</b> or sell orders. We do find evidence against the hypothesis that the trader’s decision to be a buyer or a seller depends only on the trading profits available in the limit order book. We estimate that traders submitting market <b>buy</b> <b>orders</b> have private valuations that exceed the asset value by 2. 3 % on average and receive an average payoff of at least 1. 8 % of the asset value. Traders submitting limit <b>buy</b> <b>orders</b> at the price below the best ask quote have private valuations between 0. 1 % and 2. 3 % above the asset value and earn an average payoff of between 0. 3 % and 1. 8 % of the asset value. Although the distribution of liquidity demand does not depend on conditioning information, conditioning information helps us to predict the composition of the order flow in our data. These findings imply that variation in the composition of the order flow can be explained by empirical variation in the relative profitability of alternative order choices and movements in the common value of the asset.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the interaction between}} liquidity traders and informed traders in a dynamic model of an order-driven market. Agents freely choose between limit and market orders by trading off execution price and waiting costs. In equilibrium, informed patient traders generally submit limit orders, except when their privately observed fun-damental value of the asset is {{far away from the}} current market-inferred value, in which case they become impatient and submit a market order. As a result, a market <b>buy</b> <b>order</b> is interpreted as a strong positive signal; by contrast, a limit <b>buy</b> <b>order</b> is a much weaker signal, and in some cases even negative. The model generates a rich set of relationships among prices, spreads, trading activity, and volatility. In particular, the order flow is autocorrelated if and only if there are informed traders in the market, and the order flow autocorrelation increases with the percentage of informed traders. Higher volatil-ity and smaller trading activity generate larger spreads, while a higher percentage of informed traders, controlling for volatility and trading activity, surprisingly generates smaller spreads...|$|R

We focus on a hitherto unexplored but intuitive measure of trading activity: the aggregate daily <b>order</b> imbalance, <b>buy</b> <b>orders</b> less sell orders, on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Order imbalance increases following market declines and vice versa, which reveals that investors are contrarians on aggregate. Order imbalances in either direction, excess <b>buy</b> or sell <b>orders,</b> reduce liquidity. Marketwide returns are strongly affected by contemporaneous and lagged order imbalances. Market returns reverse themselves after high-negative-imbalance, large-negative-return days. Even after controlling for aggregate volume and liquidity, market returns are affected by order imbalance. 1. ...|$|R
40|$|I {{propose a}} continuous-time model of price {{formation}} {{in a market}} where trading is conducted according to a limit-order book. Strategic liquidity traders arrive randomly {{in the market and}} dynamically choose between limit and market orders, trading off execution price with waiting costs. I prove the existence of a Markov equilibrium in which the bid and ask prices depend only on the numbers of <b>buy</b> and sell <b>orders</b> in the book, and which can be characterized in closed-form in several cases of interest. My model generates empirically verified implications for the shape of the limit-order book and the dynamics of prices and trades. In particular, I show that <b>buy</b> and sell <b>orders</b> can cluster away from the bid-ask spread, thus generating a hump-shaped limit-order book. Also, following a market <b>buy</b> <b>order,</b> both the ask and bid prices increase, with the ask increasing more than the bid—hence the spread widens...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of order flows around large intraday price changes using ultra-high-frequency data from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. We find a significant reversal of price for both intraday price decreases and increases with a permanent price impact. The volatility, the volume {{of different types of}} orders, the bid-ask spread, and the volume imbalance increase before the extreme events and decay slowly as a power law, which forms a well-established peak. The volume of <b>buy</b> market <b>orders</b> increases faster and the corresponding peak appears earlier than for sell market orders around positive events, while the volume peak of sell market <b>orders</b> leads <b>buy</b> market <b>orders</b> in the magnitude and time around negative events. When orders are divided into four groups according to their aggressiveness, we find that the behaviors of order volume and order number are similar, except for <b>buy</b> limit <b>orders</b> and canceled orders that the peak of order number postpones two minutes later after the peak of order volume, implying that investors placing large orders are more informed and {{play a central role in}} large price fluctuations. We also study the relative rates of different types of orders and find differences in {{the dynamics of}} relative rates between <b>buy</b> <b>orders</b> and sell orders and between individual investors and institutional investors. There is evidence showing that institutions behave very differently from individuals and that they have more aggressive strategies. Combing these findings, we conclude that institutional investors are more informed and play a more influential role in driving large price fluctuations. ...|$|R

A way for investors to simplify the search problem is to make the choice from stocks that have caught their attention. Motivated by the theories of human cognitive boundaries affecting investor behaviour, this thesis investigates the impact of attention effects on the behaviour of investors using a social trading platform, Shareville. Using a novel dataset from Shareville, we test the causal relation between the order volume and different attention proxies; comments, comments on a Friday and comments’ effect on <b>buy</b> <b>orders.</b> In addition, a sub sample with only the thirty largest and the thirty smallest Swedish firms is used. Our results indicate that order volume can be predicted by the number of comments on an asset, but that volume also has a positive and significant effect on the number of comments. Second, there is no evidence for that investors are more likely to show attention driven trading behaviour on a Friday. Third, we find that comments increase <b>buy</b> <b>order</b> volume more, compared to sell order volume. Fourth, the regressions containing firm size and profitability do not show an effect on order volume. We conclude that while there is a significant effect of comments on order volume, it is likely that our equations suffer from endogeneity due to reversed causality...|$|R
