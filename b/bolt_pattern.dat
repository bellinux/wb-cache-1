25|$|In 1972, {{the bell}} housing <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern</b> changed {{to match the}} larger version used on the V8 engines.|$|E
2500|$|The 1971 {{and older}} blocks use a [...] "small" [...] bell housing <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern</b> that is {{exclusive}} to AMC and small Nash sixes. In 1972 the bell housing <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern</b> {{was changed to}} match the AMC V8's - its final use was in 2006 when the 4.0 was phased out. Four bolts on the cylinder block are matched to the transmission bellhousing where an adapter plate serves both as a dust cover - two additional bolt holes on the transmission bellhousing used on the AMC V8 are used to secure the dust cover. The 1971 258 uses the [...] "small" [...] pattern, the only year 258 to do so.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1988.5 model, the {{suspension}} was redesigned and the wheels were changed {{again from the}} single bolt knockoff setup to the standard Ferrari five <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern.</b> [...] The wheel design still resembled the ones installed at the Testarossa's debut.|$|E

50|$|For 1975, the PRV {{engine was}} not {{available}} for the American market so the 164 was produced for one more year for America and Japan only. The 164 received new larger 6-panel rear lamps, electronic ignition, new seats, electric windows in the front, a new style of badging, extensive changes to the rear suspension, and the parking brake handle was moved from outboard to inboard of the driving seat. Due {{to much of the}} changes coming from the 200 series, as the 200 series switched to metric <b>bolt</b> <b>patterns,</b> the 164 uses both imperial and metric <b>bolt</b> <b>patterns</b> on the car.|$|R
2500|$|Instead of the {{standard}} AMC bell housing <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern,</b> AMC/Jeep engineers adopted the General Motors small V6 and four-cylinder <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern</b> (commonly used with GM's transverse-mounted powerplants) for their new engine, because the new AMC 2.5 replaced the four-cylinder engines that had been purchased from GM; and because AMC continued to buy the 2.8 L V6 from GM until the 4.0L I6 was introduced in 1987. The four-cylinder and V6 shared the same drivetrain components, whereas stronger transmissions were needed for the new 4.0L. The 2.5L also shared an 18mm threaded oil filter used with the GM 2.8L (ACDelco PF47 or equivalent) to 1986; when the 4.0L was phased into production with the XJ the oil filter was changed over to a 20mm thread size shared with Renaults until 1991.|$|E
2500|$|The {{brakes on}} the new TL have been {{increased}} in size, from the older [...] front disc and [...] rear disc to the now Ridgeline-sized [...] front discs and [...] rear disc, still incorporating an internal rear drum e-brake while maintaining hydraulic discs for the foot applied brakes. The <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern</b> on the car {{is no longer a}} 5 x [...] but a 5 x [...] for this generation.|$|E
2500|$|American Motors {{introduced}} a die-cast aluminum block {{version of the}} OHV [...] engine in 1961. It was produced through 1964. This engine used cast-iron cylinder liners and a cast-iron head. The cylinder heads for {{the two types of}} block (aluminum and cast iron) are of similar design, but are not interchangeable. The cylinder head for the aluminum block is roughly 1/8" [...] wider than that for the cast iron [...] block and uses a slightly different head <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s even lighter {{cast alloy}} wheels became usual—at first with splined hubs and {{knock-off}} caps—and now predominate. New versions of wire wheels are still made but often with standard hub <b>bolt</b> <b>patterns</b> {{covered by a}} center cap to fit without adapters.|$|R
50|$|Both 1963 and 1964 {{versions}} had a five-bolt {{bell housing}} pattern {{that was different}} from later six-bolt units (Mustangs switched <b>bolt</b> <b>patterns</b> around August 3, 1964). The engines switched from a generator to an alternator {{in the latter part}} of the 1964 model year.|$|R
5000|$|Toyota Motor Corporation's R {{family is}} a family of 5-speed RWD/4WD {{transmissions}} built by Aisin. They share much in common (such as the bell housing-to-body <b>bolt</b> <b>patterns)</b> with the Aisin AR transmission (rebadged MA-5 by GM, AX-15 and NV3550 by Jeep, and Isuzu AR5) ...|$|R
2500|$|The Series 3 (1984–1985) {{featured}} {{an updated}} lower front fascia. North American models received a different instrument cluster. GSL package was continued into this series, but Mazda introduced the GSL-SE sub-model. The GSL-SE had a fuel-injected 1.3L 13B RE-EGI engine producing 135hp (101kW) and [...] GSL-SEs had {{much the same}} options as the GSL (clutch-type rear LSD and rear disc brakes), but the brake rotors were larger, allowing Mazda to use the more common lug nuts (versus bolts), and a new <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern</b> of 4x114.3 (4x4.5"). Also, they had upgraded suspension with stiffer springs and shocks. The external oil cooler was reintroduced, after being dropped in the 1983 model-year for the controversial [...] "beehive" [...] water-oil heat exchanger.|$|E
2500|$|The Regal {{was most}} {{commonly}} powered by Buick's 350in³ V8, which was standard equipment on all models in 1973 and 1974 and optional on coupes but remained standard on sedans from 1975 to 1977, {{and the larger}} 455 in³ V8 was optional in 1973 and 1974 only. Starting in 1975, Regal coupes came standard with Buick's resurrected [...] V6 engine previously offered on the Skylark from 1964 to 1967; the engine's tooling had been sold to Kaiser Motors for use in Jeep models (Kaiser was purchased by American Motors in 1970 and Jeep became an AMC division) and sold back to GM by AMC in 1974. In 1975 and 1976, the Century and Regal were the only mid-sized cars in America to offer V6 engines. The <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern</b> for this vehicle is 5x.|$|E
5000|$|GM {{produced}} a 3-liter for Mercury Marine, {{based on the}} 153 (4-inch bore/3.60 stroke), but using the Chevrolet V8 bellhousing <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern.</b> The 3-liter is manufactured in Mexico where 1992-to-present engines have a one-piece rear seal {{similar to the one}} used with the Chevrolet small-block and 90-degree V6 (the flywheel <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern</b> for the later-production 3-liter does not interchange with the earlier 153 or 181 which uses the small-block and inline-six's 3.58" [...] bolt-circle, and does not use the 1986-present one-piece rear-seal flywheels since the <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern</b> is larger).|$|E

50|$|Ricardo’s {{adaptation}} of the existing all-iron gasoline V8 featured the company’s famous Comet cylinder heads and indirect injection using mechanical injectors and a rotary pump; with identical engine mounts and bellhousing <b>bolt</b> <b>patterns</b> to the gasoline version, the diesel was a straight swap and easily integrated on the production line.|$|R
50|$|The {{powertrain}} of the Metro vans {{was typically}} {{based on an}} equivalent series International light- or medium-duty truck. For example, an LM-120 1/2 ton Metro van (5,400 lb weight capacity or GVWR) with a 7 3/4 or 9 1/2 foot body effectively had the IH engine (SD-220), transmission, rearend, wheels (although with varying <b>bolt</b> <b>patterns),</b> and braking system of an L-120 pickup truck. With the introduction of each new series of truck, updated Metro vans were included {{as part of their}} commercial line.|$|R

50|$|The Iron Duke I4 used by AMC in Jeeps from 1980 to 1983 {{used the}} {{standard}} small block Chevrolet <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern</b> bell housing. The later (1984-02) AMC I4 had the GM 60 degree V6/I4 <b>bolt</b> <b>pattern,</b> {{and this was}} retained {{for the life of}} the engine. AMC often used lighter duty transmissions with the four cylinder engines.|$|E
30|$|The working {{hypothesis}} for a retreat measurement system {{was based on}} discriminating the highly reflective rib-wall bolt-plates from the background coal, and using these features as reference waypoints for a localisation solution. <b>Bolting</b> <b>patterns</b> are strictly controlled in underground mines, as they constitute the primary support preventing gate road collapse. The number of bolts installed in a segment of gate road (e.g., between two cut-throughs) is therefore a known environmental mining parameter, and by tracking the number of bolts encountered since the previous cut-through the along-track position of the mining machine can be accurately estimated.|$|R
5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of lettuce}} {{over the centuries}} has resulted in several changes through selective breeding: delayed bolting, larger seeds, larger leaves and heads, better taste and texture, a lower latex content, and different leaf shapes and colors. Work in these areas continues through the present day. Scientific research into the genetic modification of lettuce is ongoing, with over 85 field trials taking place between 1992 and 2005 in the European Union and United States to test modifications allowing greater herbicide tolerance, greater resistance to insects and fungi and slower <b>bolting</b> <b>patterns.</b> However, genetically modified lettuce is not currently used in commercial agriculture.|$|R
50|$|Rock {{mechanics}} forms part of {{the much}} broader subject of geomechanics, which {{is concerned with the}} mechanical responses of all geological materials, including soils. Rock mechanics, as applied in engineering geology, mining, petroleum, and civil engineering practice, is concerned with the application of the principles of engineering mechanics to the design of the rock structures generated by mining, drilling, reservoir production, or civil construction activity such as tunnels, mining shafts, underground excavations, open pit mines, oil and gas wells, road cuts, waste repositories, and other structures built in or of rock. It also includes the design of reinforcement systems, such as rock <b>bolting</b> <b>patterns.</b>|$|R

The visors of company-grade officers (second lieutenant through captain) are plain black leather or polymer material. Field-grade officers' visors have {{two pairs of}} clouds and lightning <b>bolts,</b> <b>patterned</b> after the oak leaf motifs used by the other services. General officers' caps add an extra pair of clouds and bolts on the visor, while the cap of the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force adds clouds and bolts around the entire cap band. The clouds and bolts are jokingly referred to in military slang as [...] "farts and darts", much as the other services' oak leaf motifs are known as [...] "scrambled eggs".|$|R
50|$|The MEL bore some {{mechanical}} similarities {{with the}} Ford FE, utilizing similar components {{such as the}} oiling system, <b>bolt</b> <b>patterns,</b> and valve stems; however, the MEL was a Lincoln-specific engine and was even larger in displacement capacity. The main bearings were 2.9 in (73,66 mm), while the rod bearings were huge at 2.6 in (66,04 mm). The connecting rod beam had a unique triangular shape with the shoulders for the bolts sitting low toward the cap mating surface (1/2 in.). There was one major difference between the MEL and FE engines besides their size and weight. The valves on MEL engines were arranged in alternating fashion (I-E-I-E-I-E-I-E) {{and not in the}} manner of the FE (E-I-E-I-I-E-I-E) where the I indicates an Intake valve and the E indicates an Exhaust valve.|$|R
40|$|The San Juan Mine and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health {{conducted}} a study to measure how development mining affected bolt loads. Twelve fully grouted, instrumented roof bolts were installed at two three-way intersections {{as part of the}} standard <b>bolting</b> <b>pattern.</b> Newly developed miniature data acquisition systems (MIDAS) were used to measure bolt load changes during initial face advance and cross-cut breakthrough. The effects of cut placement and depth on roof bolt loads were studied. This test showed how bolt loads increased at five positions along the bolt length during initial mining. Both entry advance and cross-cut breakthrough produced a similar percentage of increase in bolt loads. Geologic differences between the test sites were probably responsible for the differences in amounts of bolt loading. The test site with more top coal and a higher rock quality designation (RQD) had lower bolt loads...|$|R

5000|$|The Windsor and Romeo have subtle {{difference}}s. Valve cover <b>bolt</b> <b>patterns</b> are one. Romeo {{has fewer}} bolts than the Windsor. Another {{difference is the}} front cover bolts. The Windsor uses 8 mm and the Romeo uses 10 mm bolts. The Romeo uses jack screws on the main caps and the Windsor uses dowels. The new engine produced [...] at 4400 rpm and [...] of torque at 3500 rpm, matching the output of its predecessor. For 1998, the 4.6 L V8 received a small increase in output, resulting in [...] at 4750 rpm and [...] of torque at 3500 rpm. This was achieved through PCM calibration and a modified fuel system. Though capable of matching or exceeding the older 302 V8's output, the 4.6 L V8 was criticized for delivering inadequate performance, particularly against the larger displacement of the OHV V8 used in the Mustang's chief rival, the Chevrolet Camaro.|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines, in a {{cooperative}} project with the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, and Homestake Mining Co., Lead, SD, conducted in situ monitoring and numerical modeling of rock masses supported with cable bolts in two mechanized, cut-and-fill stopes and a shaft pillar at the Homestake Mine. Extensometers {{were used to}} measure rock displacement, while cable bolt strain gauges were installed to measure loads on both conventional and birdcage cable bolt supports. These instruments provided an assessment of rock mass behavior during mining as well as essential data for verifying results from computer analyses. The numerical modeling program FLAC was used to analyze cable <b>bolt</b> <b>patterns</b> and supports. Results from the evaluation study indicated that cable bolt strain gauges and extensometers were effective instruments for monitoring the behavior of rock masses supported with cable bolts. Also, numerical modeling of the 4 S- 48 N stope using the FIAC code provided displacement values comparable with measurements from field extensometers...|$|R
