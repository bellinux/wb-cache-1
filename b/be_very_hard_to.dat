On April 7, he sent completed models to the Mint and photographs to the Fine Arts Commission. Both the Mint and Houston responded with criticism, the former that {{the relief of}} the coin was high and difficult to reduce to coin-sized hubs. On April 19, Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock wrote in a memorandum that the coin would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> produce because the area of greatest relief on each side {{was in the same}} part of the design. Beach agreed to lower any high points that might cause the Mint difficulty.|$|E

However, instead of pushing back the release date as announced, Funk Volume decided to release the album on its initial date of November 26, for digital download and compact disc format through their website. The album was then released in compact disc format in retail stores on December 3, 2013.|$|E

25|$|Once a {{paradigm}} shift has taken place, the textbooks are rewritten. Often {{the history of science}} too is rewritten, being presented as an inevitable process leading up to the current, established framework of thought. There is a prevalent belief that all hitherto-unexplained phenomena will in due course be accounted for in terms of this established framework. Kuhn states that scientists spend most (if not all) of their careers in a process of puzzle-solving. Their puzzle-solving is pursued with great tenacity, because the previous successes of the established paradigm tend to generate great confidence that the approach being taken guarantees that a solution to the puzzle exists, even though it may <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find. Kuhn calls this process normal science.|$|E
25|$|M. drewseni {{typically}} feed on nectar, pulp (paper), {{and other}} insects. Most foraging for food occurs {{close to the}} nest (within 40–50 m). When this species preys on other insects, it typically snatches the prey, chews it into a pulp and then returns to the nest. Foragers also have been seen attacking insects that are stuck on spiders’ webs. ll captured prey tends to be fairly substantial in size (greater than 3mm) but small enough that the wasp could chew the whole insect {{before returning to the}} nest. Because foragers chew their prey so quickly, it can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> determine exactly what their prey is. In fact, M. flavitarsis is the only Mischocyttarus species with published prey information. They reportedly prey on flies and caterpillars and, occasionally, meat and fish. Aside from various prey, nectar {{plays a key role in}} M. drewseni diets. This nectar is typically consumed from the buds and flowers of Althernanthera ficoidae, Hyptis atrorubens, and Clidemia hirta. Once a wasp finds a good source of nectar, it tends to return to it many times, just like workers return to the same nest material supply. This seems to be an individual venture, as there is no communication between foragers when a good nectar supply is located.|$|E

500|$|Response towards Weaves {{from music}} journalists upon release was {{generally}} favorable.

Noisey said that the EP [...] "experiments and dips across genre lines in a balancing act between of laxity and concentration, without all of the pretension and exclusivity that normally accompanies a buzzing indie band". A more mixed review came from Liz Fox of Popmatters, finding most of the aspects of Weaves typical of indie music released in the previous fifteen years but praising Burke's [...] "sultry" [...] vocal performance that [...] "improve the elaborate backdrop, allowing for some simplicity among the chaos". Now called the EP an [...] "excellent introduction for new fans", writing that its only downfall was the track [...] "Do You See Past" [...] due to its [...] "more sophisticated, less interesting electro-pop sound". In a list by another Popmatters journalist of the best indie rock albums of 2014, Weaves ranked number eight.|$|E

It enables a force to eliminate civilian support for resistance by eliminating the civilians—recognizing Mao Zedong's dictum that guerrillas among a civilian population are fish in water, it removes the fish by draining the water. When enforced as part of a political settlement, as happened with the forced resettlement of ethnic Germans to the new Germany after 1945, it can contribute to long-term stability. Some individuals of the large German population in Czechoslovakia and prewar Poland had encouraged Nazi jingoism before the Second World War, but this was forcibly resolved.

In other words, the Riemann hypothesis is in some sense equivalent to saying that μ(x) behaves like a random sequence of coin tosses. When μ(x) is non-zero its sign gives the parity of the number of prime factors of x, so informally the Riemann hypothesis says that the parity of the number of prime factors of an integer behaves randomly. Such probabilistic arguments in number theory often give the right answer, but tend to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> make rigorous, and occasionally give the wrong answer for some results, such as Maier's theorem.|$|E
