40|$|Some {{populations of}} shortnose {{sturgeon}} Acipenser brevirostrum and pallid sturgeon Scaphirhynchus albus have been divided by hydroelectric dams, and migration downstream past the dams likely continues. No protection for downstream migrants is presently available, {{and the behavior}} of sturgeon to guidance structures has not been studied. We conducted experiments in a 5. 4 -m-long × 1. 5 -m-wide flume with a water depth of 37 cm to determine the guidance efficiency and behavior of yearling shortnose and pallid sturgeon to two guidance structures, a <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> and a louver array. We tested one vertical <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> configuration with slats spaced 3. 9 cm apart (clear spacing). The <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> slats were oriented directly into the approach flow, and the row of slats was oriented at a 45 ° angle to the flow. We tested two louver array configurations, one with slats spaced 3. 9 cm apart and one with slats spaced 9. 0 cm apart (clear spacing). Louver slats were oriented at a 90 ° angle to the flow, and the row of slats was oriented at a 20 ° angle to the approach flow. Mean approach velocity to both structures was 31 - 34 cm/s. Eighteen shortnose sturgeon tagged with passive integrated transponders were tested once in each configuration; 24 - 38 pallid sturgeon were tested in each configuration. Shortnose sturgeon showed some behavioral differences due to experience with the <b>bar</b> <b>rack,</b> but experience {{did not affect the}} percent guided. Both sturgeon species were guided efficiently by the louver array (96 - 100 %) but less efficiently by the <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> (58 - 80 %). Shortnose sturgeon were more likely to contact the <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> at night than during the day (P = 0. 01) and at night were more likely to contact the <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> than the louver array (P = 0. 006). Bar racks guided fewer individuals at night than during the day. For pallid sturgeon, the percentages guided by day and night were 80 and 58, respectively; for shortnose sturgeon, the percentages were 80 and 67. Both species used vision to avoid structures because both increased contact with structures at night. Shortnose sturgeon were superior to pallid sturgeon at swimming off the bottom and avoiding structures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: VAW of ETH Zurich conducts {{research}} on louvers and angled bar racks, so-called ‘fish guidance structures’ (FGS) for run-of-river hydropower applications. The {{purpose of the}} system is to improve the sustainable and efficient usage of hydropower by providing safe downstream fish guidance past the hydropower intake, guidance towards a fishbypass collection system, and minimizing negative economic impacts. The FGSs create complex two- and three-dimensional flow structures at different scales in the water column near them and the bypass, which can be sensed and behaviorally avoided by approaching fish. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on bar racks with and without a solid bottom overlay angled at 15 ° and 30 ° to the approach flow in a laboratory flume. The bars or slats were angled 45 ° against the flow direction. The bar spacing, thickness, and length were 0. 05 m, 0. 01 m and 0. 10 m, respectively. The mean approach flow velocity and flow depth were 0. 60 m/s and 0. 9 m/s, respectively. Profiles of longitudinal and transversal flow velocity components and turbulence characteristics in the water column were measured upstream, downstream, and around the structures using 2 D-Laser Doppler Anemometer at 1 kHz. The results of the experiments will be presented and discussed in relation to fish guidance efficiency of the investigated <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> configurations obtained from live-fish experiments. In the companion paper by Peter et al. 2015, the results of live-fish experiments carried out in the same flume for the same and different <b>bar</b> <b>rack,</b> and flow configurations will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Narrow bar spacing’s (less than {{or equal}} to 2 inches) have been {{installed}} at many hydro project intakes to reduce entrainment of fish through turbines and, when combined with angled structures, to guide them to downstream bypasses. The ability of narrow bar spacing’s to prevent entrainment is dependent on fish size and behavior and approach velocities. Even when fish are small enough to pass through a given bar spacing, many fish will actively avoid entrainment through intake racks as long as approach velocities are low enough for them to escape. Additionally, the relatively small size (less than 8 inches in length) of most fish that are entrained at hydro projects (with and without narrow bar spacing) usually results in high turbine survival rates. Therefore, determining appropriate bar spacing’s for any species or life stage should include estimation of physical and behavioral exclusion associated with proposed intake modifications, as well as estimates of turbine passage survival for fish that are entrained. These parameters can be estimated using existing data describing <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> exclusion efficiencies and theoretical models developed for predicting turbine passage survival. When combined with the proportion of fish expected to pass over spillways for the expected river flows during a migration season, the <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> exclusion and turbine survival estimates can be used to calculate total downstream passage survival for several bar spacing’s and a range of fish lengths in order to assess relative effectiveness. A dataset developed for shortnose sturgeon at a hydro project in the Northeast will be presented to demonstrate how such an analysis can be used for determining appropriate bar spacing’s for effectively protecting sturgeon species at any project...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In Switzerland {{hydropower}} production contributes roughly 60 % to {{the electricity}} supply. However {{for the protection}} of fishes almost no downstream migration facilities yet exist. Until 2030 all hydropower facilities have to provide a safe downstream migration corridor for fishes. In Europe some technological solutions exist to enable downstream migration at small hydropower plants, but no analogous solutions exist for larger hydropower facilities. Guidance efficiency of five fish species (barbel, spirling, brown trout, eel and grayling) was tested in a laboratory flume with modified <b>bar</b> <b>racks</b> and louvers angled at 30 and 15 degree to the approaching flow (0. 3 - 0. 9 m/s). The bar spacings were 5 and 11 cm. The test fishes were collected from wild river populations using electrofishing techniques. A total of 34 different configurations were evaluated. For selected experiments we additionally used a bottom overlay in order to increase the guiding efficiency. All the experiments were documented with video recordings. A detailed analysis of the flow is presented by the companion paper by Albayrak et al. (2015). The main angle of the guiding array (15 or 30 degree) did not {{have a significant effect on}} the guidance efficiency. Apart from the spirlin the increase in flow velocity did not affect the successful bypass passage. The guidance efficiency was • higher for <b>bar</b> <b>racks</b> and louvers with clear spacings of 5 cm, compared to 11 cm • higher for <b>bar</b> <b>racks</b> than for louvers (tested with barbel and spirlin) • considerably higher with a bottom overlay, notably for grayling.

The Project is located in Cohoes, New York, on the Mohawk River, approximately 2. 5 river miles upstream from its confluence with the Hudson River. The Project was issued a new FERC License in 2007, which required downstream fish passage for anadromous and catadromous fish, as well as resident/riverine fish species. The construction of the downstream fishway was completed in the summer of 2009 and included; an angled <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> with one inch clear spacing and a concrete eel diversion structure located {{at the base of the}} <b>bar</b> <b>rack,</b> and a fish conveyance system with; two entrance locations, surface and bottom gates, a collection chamber, an overflow weir and a final discharge pipe that descends 90 feet in elevation.

Prior efforts to collect a sufficient number of adult test eels within the Project waters were unsuccessful in 2009 and 2010 due to limited availability. As such, test eels were purchased from a commercial fishery on the Sebasticook River in Newport, ME. A total of 105 eels was injected into the fishway and recaptured in the tailrace using a customized net pen.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{downstream}} migrant silver phase American eels Anguilla rostrata to guide along various configurations of angled bar racks (25 - and 50 -mm clear spacing) and louvers (50 -mm clear spacing) was evaluated {{in a laboratory}} flume. Guidance tests were conducted with bar racks and louvers angled at 45 and 15 degrees to the approach flow at velocities of 0. 3 m/s to 0. 9 m/s. A full-depth bypass was used for all tests. Guidance efficiency was calculated by dividing the number of fish recovered from the bypass {{by the total number}} recovered downstream (bypass and entrainment combined). Mean guidance efficiency (MGE) with the 45 -degree, 25 -mm <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> ranged from a low of 56. 8 % at 0. 6 m/s to a high of 65. 9 % at 0. 9 m/s. MGE of the 45 -clegree, 50 -mm <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> decreased from 72. 7 % at 0. 3 m/s to 54. 5 % at 0. 9 m/s, while MGE of the 45 -clegree louver ranged from a low of 34. 9 % at 0. 3 m/s to a high of 61. 9 % at 0. 6 m/s. Guidance efficiency was considerably higher for tests with the 15 -degree structures, exceeding 88 % at all velocities during tests with a solid bottom overlay placed over the lower 30 cm of each structure. During tests without the overlay in place and at a velocity of 0. 6 m/s, guidance efficiency of both bar racks and louvers decreased to 83. 3 and 60. 7 %, respectively. The estimated guidance efficiencies indicate that angled bar racks and louvers have potential for diverting American eels away from hydro intakes, particularly if a shallow angle is employed (e. g., 15 degrees to the approach flow). However, we believe our estimates of guidance efficiency are higher than would be experienced at an actual intake due to the full depth bypass, the limited depth of the flume, and the short length of each rack configuration that we evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Tests with Connecticut River shortnose {{sturgeon}} (sns), Acipenser brevirostrum, in the Conte AFRC flume (36. 6 m long x 6. 1 m ft wide x 4. 3 m deep) observed sns behavior, impingement, and entrainment as they encountered a vertical <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> (5 cm clear spacing). Cultured juveniles (yearlings and older, larger fish), and wild adults were observed. Three mean approach bottom water velocities (30. 5 cm, 61, and 91 cm/s) {{were used in}} tests with no orifice in the rack; other tests observed sns at 61 cm/s approach velocity to the rack with an orifice (1 m 2 opening) in the rack. Underwater video camera and TIRIS PIT systems monitored sns movement and behavior at the <b>bar</b> <b>rack.</b> Most sns were oriented tail downstream when they were 60 cm upstream from the rack, so fish were backing down the flume. Initial movement at the rack of some fish in all age classes was to swim upward. No adult or older juvenile was impinged or entrained during any approach velocity. No yearling was impinged at 30. 5 cm/s, but 7. 7 â€“ 12. 5 % was impinged at 61 cm/s, and 33. 3 â€“ 40. 0 % was impinged at 91 cm/s. The entrainment of yearlings at the three approach velocities follow: 4. 3 â€“ 9. 1 % at 30. 5 cm/s, 7. 1 â€“ 27. 8 % at 61 cm/s, and 66. 7 â€“ 80. 0 % at 91 cm/s. Number of sns tracked at the rack with the orifice and the number (%) that entered the orifice follows: 21 yearlings tracked and six (28. 6 %) entered the orifice; 17 older juveniles tracked and 7 (41. 2 %) entered the orifice; nine adults tracked and zero entered. All of the 13 fish entering the orifice approached on or just above the bottom. Four swam headfirst downstream through the orifice, the remainder (nine sns) went tailfirst. Six of 13 fish swam in and out (upstream) of the orifice, the remainder swam one-way downstream through the orifice. Some juveniles (even yearlings) will enter an orifice with no attraction flow.

A major component of the population model will be estimated losses of smolts and kelts at each project during their downstream migration. Atlantic salmon smolts and kelts migrating downstream may be subject to mortality due to injuries sustained during passage through turbines and fish bypasses, or over spillways. In addition to direct mortality associated with these passage routes, indirect mortality may result from increased predation rates or reduced fitness associated with the stress of downstream passage and migration delays. Cumulative effects from passage at multiple projects may also lead to increased mortality during the in-river migration and after fish reach the estuary and marine environment. Consequently, we developed estimates of downstream passage survival of smolts and kelts at 15 hydroelectric projects on the Penobscot River and its tributaries. To accomplish this, we estimated entrainment rates of smolts and kelts of various lengths and calculated turbine survival for entrained fish using an established turbine blade strike probability and mortality model. Survival rates for fish passing downstream over spillways or through fish bypass facilities were also estimated for each project based on existing site-specific data or using information from other projects with similar design features. Spillway passage was assumed to be proportional to flow. Bypass efficiencies were based on <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> spacing, available literature, and field studies conducted at two of the projects.

40|$|Recently, {{concern has}} arisen over {{potential}} fish mortality at hydropower facilities operating on water bodies that support resident, warmwater fisheries. At the Harry S. Truman hydropower facility, initial pumpback operations resulted in mortality of fish {{residing in the}} tailrace. This facility has a generating flow capacity of 60, 000 cfs and a pumpback capacity of 27, 500 cfs, and because of these large flows, the Kansas City District Corps of Engineers (COE) expressed concern over long-term impacts of the project to the fisheries resources of the area. Accordingly, COE suspended all pumpback operations and initiated studies of alternative fish protection methods that could be implemented to prevent further fish losses. A number of fish diversion systems and fish barriers were conceptually designed and studied to determine their potential for cost-effective application at the Truman Project. These methods included angled diversion screens and louvers, inclined plane diversion screens, barrier nets, and <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> systems. Laboratory studies with live fish indicated that angled screens, louvers, and bar racks operating at reduced flow rates offered the best potential for preventing mortality.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{effective}} fish passage and protection at water intakes {{is an important}} issue confronting industry and resource agency professionals throughout the world. Project owners often are required to install and evaluate protection devices to meet regulatory requirements that are associated with operating licenses and permits. There is a wide array of technologies that currently are available for use at water intakes. The goal of this report was to present information from a comprehensive review of recent studies that have evaluated the effectiveness of existing and emerging fish protection and passage technologies designed for application at water intakes. A literature search and a survey of industry and resource agency professionals were conducted to identify available literature describing the application and evaluation of passage and protection technologies. All relevant reports and publications were reviewed and a summary of project design, study methods, and effectiveness results was prepared. Available fish passage and protection technologies are diverse and vary widely with respect to biological and engineering criteria. Behavioural guidance technologies (e. g., lights and sound systems) continue to be studied extensively. However, the use of high-frequency sound to repel clupeids (shad and herring) is the only behavioural technology that has been accepted as a proven technology. Strobe lights continue to demonstrate potential for successful application based on results from controlled experiments (i. e., cage tests), but systems that have been evaluated at field sites have not demonstrated consistently high levels of effectiveness. Infrasound is an emerging technology that has been tested in controlled experiments and during some field evaluations. The ability of infrasound to repel salmonids has been demonstrated inseveral small-scale studies, but operational constraints and mixed results to date make the future use of infrasound uncertain. Air bubble curtains were examined during two field studies at Midwestern hydro sites. A new concept involving the use of turbulent surface water and increased flow velocities has been proposed and limited testing with a current inducer device has been evaluated at small New England hydro projects. Further development of the surface turbulence concept and rigorous laboratory and field testing are required before viability of such technologies are determined. Screening systems used as barriers and/or diversion structures have been widely applied. Available screening technologies continue to be evaluated to improve the effectiveness of installed systems. Relatively new screening technologies that are gaining acceptance are the high-velocity Eicher screen and Modular Inclined Screen (MIS). Modifications to traveling water screens also have been made, resulting in greater survival of impinged fish at cooling water intakes. Bar racks (perpendicular and angled to the flow) have been prescribed at a large number of FERC-licensed projects (especially projects with anadromous species), often in conjunction with surface bypasses. The effectiveness of <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> and bypass facilities has been mixed, with studies continuing to be conducted at many projects in attempts to improve bypass efficiency. Barrier nets and louvers both have been successfully applied during the last five years at several projects.

Downstream {{migration}} of European eel at three German hydropower stations. NINA Report 1355 : 53 pages, including appendix. Background and methods The {{aim of this}} study was to examine migration behaviour and losses of European silver eel when passing three run-of-the river hydropower stations in Germany. These were the Unkelmühle power station in the Sieg, the power station in Gengenbach in the Kinzig (both tributaries to the Rhine), and Kuhlemühle power station in the Diemel (tributary to the Weser). The Unkelmühle power station is designed with several bypass routes where fish can pass outside the turbines. At the power station in Gengenbach, the position of a movable turbine can be adjusted to let downstream migrating fish pass above or under the turbine. Narrowly spaced bar racks have been installed in front of the turbine intakes at both Unkelmühle, River Sieg (10 mm), and Gengenbach, River Kinzig (15 mm), to prevent fish from entering the turbines. At the Kuhlemühle power station, River Diemel, an Archimedes screw turbine is installed without a <b>bar</b> <b>rack</b> in front of its entrance. Archimedes screws are regarded as being fish-friendly turbines, but few studies have tested this assumption. The study was performed during 2014 to 2016 by tagging 542 European silver eels with radio transmitters. Their migration in the river and past the power stations was recorded. Results and conclusions Overall, we recorded low mortality for downstream migrating silver eels at these power stations. However, there are uncertainties linked to the survival estimates, particularly at Gengenbach and Kuhlemühle. The mortality of eels when they passed the Unkelmühle power station was 0 - 4 % and 0 - 8 % in the two consecutive study years. This shows that it is possible to obtain low mortalities for downstream migrating eels at run-of-the-river power stations with special protection measures to facilitate migration and reduce mortality. No direct turbine mortality occurred, as no eel slipped through the bar racks in front of the turbines, as expected due to the narrow bar spacing. The reason that we give mortality estimates as a range (0 - 4 % and 0 - 8 %), is that the fate of some tagged eels after passing the Unkelmühle power station is unknown, which makes it difficult to determine if they were alive or dead after passing. Further, three individuals showed movements indicating that they were taken by birds, but it is not known whether they were dead at the power station and taken by bird predators, injured by passing the power station and therefore taken by predators, or whether they were uninjured but taken by predators anyway. The estimates given as ranges take this uncertainty into account, and imply that the mortality at the Unkelmühle power station could have been zero in both study years, but the mortality could also have been up to 4 % in the first study year and up to 8 % in the second year. If there was some mortality linked to passing Unkelmühle power station, this must have been due to injuries occurring in the bypass routes, or increased predation at the power station area. Increased predation may occur if fish are injured and thereby easier prey. It is also possible that presence of injured fish of different species at power stations attracts predators, such that the likelihood of being taken by a predator increases also for uninjured fish. None of the tagged eels became stationary at the power station, indicative of being dead, neither at Gengenbach or Kuhlemühle. However, there are uncertainties for the survival estimates at these power stations, because eels may drift downstream after they are dead. Release of tagged dead eels showed that eels that potentially died when passing Gengenbach or Kuhlemühle could have drifted several kilometers and out of the monitored area below the power stations. Hence, mortality at the power station is in such cases not necessarily detected. The survival estimates at Unkelmühle were more certain, because the fish were tracked over a longer distance below the power station, and implicitly there were fewer individuals with an uncertain fate. Some eels became stationary on river stretches below Gengenbach and Kuhlemühle power stations, and might be dead (14 % and 23 % of the eels that passed the Gengenbach and Kuhlemühle, respectively). However, eels may cease migration and migrate downstream another year, so an eel becoming stationary may not necessarily be dead. Eels mainly used migration routes with a large proportion of the water flow when passing the power stations. At Unkelmühle, most of the downstream migrating eels used the spillway gate, or the bypass route leading fish from the bar racks in front of the turbines into the flushing channel and back to the river via a route outside the turbines. Only two eels used the custom-made side bypasses for eels, and only a small proportion of the eels (< 10 %) used the custom-made bottom bypass at Unkelmühle. At Gengenbach, the largest proportion of eels passed through the section where the moveable turbine was installed, and at Kuhlemühle, the largest proportion passed through the Archimedes screw turbine. A potential negative effect by Archimedes screw turbines may be migration delays. However, most eels migrated fast through the Archimedes screw turbine, and did not hesitate or stop the migration either upstream or downstream of the turbine. In fact, eels migrating through the Archimedes screw turbine or over the dam passed the power station area faster than eels using the other routes. Hence, eels were not markedly delayed in their downstream migration by using the Archimedes screw. However, there was large individual variation, and some individuals spent a long time in passing the power station...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis was to measure the head loss caused by fish-friendly trash racks in an open water channel and to measure the {{turbulent}} flow field around its bars. Angled model trash <b>racks</b> with different <b>bar</b> arrangement and orientation were tested, accompanied by a bypass. As {{a part of the}} master thesis a literature review was done with special focus on the turbulent flow field around bars and on different equations used for head loss prediction. Experiments were carried out at the NTNU hydraulic laboratory in a straight open channel. Head loss measurements were carried out for six racks at six different discharges. The measurements related to the turbulent flow field were carried out by the V 3 V PIV system from TSI Inc. in vicinity of the bars downstream and upstream of the trash racks. The results showed that horizontally <b>barred</b> <b>racks</b> overall performed better than trash racks with vertical streamwise and inclined bars with regards to head loss. The results also provide detailed volumetric velocity distribution plots in vicinity of the bars. Head loss predictions were {{made on the basis of}} several head loss equations. The head loss equations were able to predict the actual head losses to a certain degree, but further studies are needed to fully determine the effects of angled trash racks and bypasses on head losses.

40|$|Partial-depth, {{impermeable}} guidance structures (or guide walls) {{are used}} to enhance downstream passage effectiveness at a hydroelectric facility by actively guiding fish to a safe passage route (i. e. the bypass). Guide walls have been installed {{in a variety of}} ways and, like many fish passage devices, have resulted in variable efficiency rates. Currently, the most common type of installment is a steel panel guide wall attached to a floating boom. While less utilized than other guidance structure options (e. g. louvers and <b>bar</b> <b>racks),</b> guide walls have been gaining popularity, particularly within the Northwest United States. The aim of this dissertation is to perform a literature review on guide walls and to provide a detailed assessment on how the key design parameters of a guide wall impact the flow field. Chapter 1 is broken into two sections. First, a literature review is performed on guide walls, explaining the history of their use and their effectiveness. Second, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed and used to evaluate the effect of several guide wall design parameters (depth, angle, and approach flow velocity). Chapter 2 provides another analysis of the hydraulic conditions upstream of a guide wall, but does so using a lab-scale model. The results of Chapter 1 are compared to that of Chapter 2. Lastly, Chapter 3 performs a sensitivity analysis by evaluating the effect of the bypass flow percentage on the key metric (the ratio of the vertical velocity component to the sweeping velocity magnitude) developed in Chapter 1 2 ̆ 6 2...|$|R
40|$|Downstream fish passage at {{hydroelectric}} {{projects is}} an important aspect to restore diadromous fish populations to river systems. Providing downstream passage at hydro facilities is a common FERC license condition and mandatory prescriptions can be implemented by federal agencies. Passage facilities such as bypasses, <b>bar</b> <b>racks,</b> louvers, and Eicher screens can be expensive to install and operate and bypass effectiveness can be poor if not designed properly. A new technology which has potential to improve downstream passage effectiveness, while increasing generating capacity is the Alden turbine, which was developed through the U. S Department of Energy’s (DOE) former Advance HydroTurbine Systems Program. The Alden turbine is designed to allow the safe passage of downstream migrating fish through an operating turbine rather than using non-generation spill over dams or through bypasses. The development of this turbine has included pilot-scale biological and engineering tests funded by the DOE and, more recently, EPRI-sponsored research to re-design the turbine to increase flow and power and to develop blade leading edge designs that reduce strike-related fish mortality. In 2009 and 2010, with funding from DOE and several industry partners, EPRI contracted Voith Hydro to complete the engineering design of the turbine components and conduct model tests {{in preparation for the}} first installation and wider scale commercialization. Survival predictions for full-scale applications are very high (98 % or greater for fish up to 8 inches in length) and will be verified ·with the first field installation (expected by 2015). We present engineering and biological performance data, cost information, and potential applications where the Alden turbine can be used to safely pass fish downstream...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavioural}} {{response of}} downstream migrating nonsalmonid fish to hydraulic conditions associated with river infrastructure is poorly understood. The response of downstream migrating adult European eels (Anguilla anguilla) to <b>bar</b> <b>racks</b> (12 ?mm <b>bar</b> spacing) angled on the {{vertical and horizontal}} planes under different flow regimes and during periods of darkness was assessed. Eels predominantly moved along the channel floor and wall, tending to follow routes where turbulence intensity was high. Time taken to approach the racks was greater than expected if fish had moved passively with the flow. Eels did not exhibit clear avoidance behaviour prior to encountering the racks, instead marked changes in behaviour occurred only after physical contact was made with the structure. No impingement or passage through the racks occurred, and passes per approach were high (98. 3 %), when vertical racks were angled 15 °, 30 ° or 45 ° relative to the flow. Impingement and passage through the racks only occurred when horizontally inclined racks were placed perpendicular to the flow. The time eels were impinged on the racks was negatively related to discharge when angled at 30 ° relative to the channel floor, and positively related when upright. Frequency of impingement was higher under low discharge (132. 9 ?±? 16. 6 ?l·s? 1). Impinged eels escaped from racks at approach velocities of 0. 90 ?±? 0. 05 ?m·s? 1. Passage through the upright rack was common under high discharge (278. 9 ?±? 36. 2 ?l·s? 1). The information presented will improve current fish passage criteria for European eels that are required to develop more effective fish passage facilities. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Fish passing {{downstream}} through hydro turbines may {{be subject}} to mortality rates between 5 and 30 %, depending on species, fish size, and turbine design and operation. Juvenile and adult sturgeons may encounter multiple hydro projects during seasonal downstream movements and, consequently, some populations can be susceptible to potentially high rates of turbine passage and mortality. Although most downstream fish passage technologies have been evaluated {{with a wide variety of}} freshwater and diadromous fishes, relatively few studies have been conducted with sturgeon species. Turbine passage mortality typically is mitigated through the use of physical screening devices that reduce entrainment and guide fish to alternative downstream passage routes. Several lab and field studies have investigated guidance and exclusion of sturgeon exposed to various configurations of narrow-spaced <b>bar</b> <b>racks</b> and louvers, with effectiveness typically being dependent on bar spacing, structure angle to flow, and approach velocity. Bypass design and location are also important to passing sturgeon safely downstream. Laboratory data suggest bypass entrance velocities should be about 1. 5 m/s or greater to effectively attract and pass sturgeon. For fish that pass through turbines, there is evidence that sturgeon may be less susceptible to injury and mortality than many teleost species. This is likely due to their tough integument, lack of scales, and cartilaginous skeleton, all of which probably contribute to lower rates of blade strike mortality. A review of recent studies examining downstream passage alternatives for sturgeon will be presented, as well as assessments of total project survival that account for passage route selection and associated mortality rates. With this information, the need for and feasibility of downstream passage facilities for sturgeon can be evaluated and used to develop appropriate mitigation measures...|$|R
