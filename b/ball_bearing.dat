5|$|Ruby Loftus Screwing a Breech Ring (1943) – in {{the autumn}} of 1942 the WAAC {{commissioned}} Knight to paint a portrait to bolster female recruitment to the ordnance factories, as the Ministry of Supply were concerned at the level of disaffection and absenteeism among women working in the factories. The resulting painting {{is one of the largest}} oil paintings in the entire WAAC collection, and the largest single figure portrait it acquired throughout the war. The painting was first shown on 30April 1943 at the Royal Academy and the next day was reproduced in eight British newspapers. The painting, along with Knight and Loftus, also featured in a British Paramount News short film shown in cinemas, and was reproduced in a poster version by WAAC. The success of the painting led to further industrial commissions for Knight throughout the 1940s. In 1945 she painted Switch Works at Ellison Switchgear in Birmingham. This was followed by paintings of operations at the Dow Mac concrete railway-sleeper works and at the Skefko <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> factory.|$|E
25|$|Each ship {{contained}} a rotating statue platform. One platform was mounted on caged bronze balls {{and is the}} earliest example of the thrust <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> previously {{believed to have been}} first envisioned by Leonardo da Vinci but only developed much later. Previous Roman <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> finds (used for water wheel axles in thermal baths) had a lenticular shape. The second platform was almost identical in design but used cylindrical bearings. Although consensus is that the platforms were meant for displaying statues, it has also been suggested that they may have been platforms for deck cranes used to load supplies.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the screw}} is {{tightened}} it pushes the Belleville and thrust washers onto the gear/pulley. This creates {{contact between the}} washers and <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> inside of the gear/pulley. The friction created by the contact between the washers and <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> is, aided by grease (commonly silicone grease), designed so that as one washer moves, the <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> rotate.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors influencing <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> service life is its internal radial clearance. However, this parameter is also very complex because it depends on applied radial load and <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> dimensions, surface finish and manufacturing materials. Thermal condition of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> also significantly affects internal radial clearance. Despite many researches performed in order to find out relevant facts about different aspects of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> thermal behaviour, only few of them are dealing with the real working conditions, where high concentration of solid contaminant particles is present. That’s why the main goal of research presented in this paper was to establish statistically significant correlation between <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> temperatures, their working time and concentration of contaminant particles in their grease. Because of especially difficult working conditions, the typical conveyor idlers bearings were selected as representative test samples and appropriate solid particles from open pit coal mines were used as artificial contaminants. Applied experimental methodology included thermographic inspection, as well as usage of custom designed test rig for <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> service life testing. Finally, by obtained experimental data processing in advanced software, statistically significant mathematical correlation between mentioned bearings characteristics was determined and applied in commonly used internal radial clearance equation. That is the most important contribution of performed research - the new equation and methodology for <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> internal clearance determination which could be used for eventual improvement of existing bearings service life equations.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the Swedish <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> industry during the Second World War, including subsidiary operations in Germany and the United Kingdom. It determines that these <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> were {{very important to}} the war effort in both countries, comprising in total about 58 % of German supplies and 31 % of British. Despite favouring Germany with more exports, the Swedish government allowed the British access to Swedish territory to ensure the delivery of the bearings through the German blockade. In relation to price increases for other exports, prices for <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> were time-dependent on the position of the acquiring country. From an overall perspective, the United Kingdom received a discount which Germany did not share. However, with the exception of direct exports, representing respectively about 10 % and 15 % of total German and British supplies, it would have been difficult for the Swedish industry to successfully withhold all supplies of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> to either belligerent. Ultimately, any shortage of Swedish <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> in either belligerent could have been overcome only by long-term industrial changes and import substitution programmes...|$|R
25|$|However, the city's {{location}} {{close to}} London {{and at the}} centre of Essex has helped it grow in importance as an administrative and distribution centre. The one-time largest employer in Chelmsford, RHP, the former Hoffman <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> manufacturing company, closed its New Street/Rectory Lane site in 1989. Some of the factory remains and has been converted into luxury apartments and a health club {{although most of the}} site was demolished {{to make way for the}} Rivermead Campus of the Anglia Ruskin University.|$|E

The ride was dismantled on 17 July 2008. Investigators then confirmed on 19 July 2008 that they had discovered a faulty drive shaft during their inspection. They believed {{that one of the}} axles that is designed to hold the passenger carriage horizontal failed. The drive shaft had been replaced by Huss Maschinefabrik, the ride's manufacturer, in 2003.|$|E
25|$|The R32 Skyline GT-R N1 street car {{marked the}} N1 engine's {{introduction}} to the consumer. R32, 33, and 34 N1 street cars were known for lack of amenities and their light weight. The R33 N1 engine and turbochargers were slightly revised, and the R34 N1 engine saw further improvement. The camshaft timing was altered slightly for more torque. R33 and R34 N1 turbochargers are the same size however R34 N1s use a <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> center section. NISMO states the ball bearings in the R34 N1 allow them to spool 400rpm faster than R33 N1.|$|E

25|$|The BCNR33 GT-R version {{also had}} the same RB26DETT engine that the BNR32 was {{equipped}} with, although torque had been improved, due {{to changes in the}} turbo compressor aerodynamics, turbo dump pipe, and intercooler. The turbo core changed from a sleeve bearing to a <b>ball</b> <b>bearing,</b> but the turbine itself remained ceramic, except on N1 turbos (steel turbine, sleeve bearing). From the R33 onward, all GT-Rs received Brembo brakes. In 1995 the GT-R received an improved version of the RB26DETT, the ATTESA-ETS four-wheel-drive system, and Super HICAS 4-wheel steering.|$|E

25|$|The GT-R reappeared in 1999, with {{a revised}} chassis and other updates. The R34 turbos {{received}} a <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> core. The R34 N1 turbos had a metal exhaust wheel, and <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> center section. The turbo outlet pipes were changed from cast to formed metal outlets. The intercooler outlet side and rear turbo dump pipe had temperature probes fitted in the V-spec models. The biggest feature and most significant feature to the R34 GT-R that wasn't seen {{on any other}} model skyline was the display unit {{at the top of}} the dashboard. This display unit was very significant for the car at its time. This display showed many of the cars engine stats including boost pressure, oil temp, water temp and more. As a 1999 car this kind of technology was very rare and advanced at the time. The display was capable of showing the G-force that the car was under when driving and there was also a lap timer that could be started by a button that was located near the gear lever. There was a computer jack lead hidden underneath the left passenger side skirt that could be used to transfer driving data from the car to a laptop. This could only be done with a Japanese version of Windows and Japanese software, which today is very hard to come by.|$|E
