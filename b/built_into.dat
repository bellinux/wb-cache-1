5|$|The 2-acre (1 ha) walled {{kitchen garden}} {{was built in}} the early 1700s to provide fruit and {{vegetables}} for the estate. The Victorian head gardener's cottage is <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the southern wall. Alongside the west wall is a private path, known as the Colonel's Walk, used by the family to bypass the kitchen garden on their way to church. There are traces of original chimneys <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the wall supporting espaliered fruit trees, located there in order to maintain an optimum temperature for year-round growth. One of these chimneys has been restored. The garden is still in use today and includes traditional and exotic varieties , and fruit bushes, some of which are used to make jams and chutneys for sale in the hall's tearooms.|$|E

5|$|Algocen Realty Holdings Ltd., {{the real}} estate branch on the Algoma Central Railway first {{commissioned}} The Algo Centre Mall project. The project was subsequently approved by the Ontario Municipal Board in 1978, with an estimated cost of $10 million. Construction then began in 1979 with the project being finished the next year. The 80-room Algo Inn, the town's largest hotel and retirement residence, was also <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the mall. In its first year, 1980, the mall featured Woolco, Dominion, and Shoppers Drug Mart, {{and a total of}} 35 units. A distinct architectural feature of the building was rooftop parking.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{has survived}} years of wear and warfare, {{one of the}} palace's wings is now in danger of {{collapsing}} into the Black Sea below. Cracks have begun {{to appear in the}} library, housing almost 10,000 books and manuscripts. Although Edward Blore had a state-of-the-art drainage system <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the palace's foundation, years of neglect and the construction of a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the potential for a landslide. Another potential looming disaster is surrounding the medieval-style gatehouse near the palace's west side.|$|E
5|$|Another company, Houser Vending Co., Inc., {{developed}} a French fry vending machine named Mr. Crispy's, {{which was used}} in various locations such as college campuses and factories since at least September 1990. The fries were cooked in 365°F sunflower oil for around 40 seconds, and 500 orders of fries were prepared before the oil was changed. The machine had a feature that automatically turned it off {{in the event of}} a malfunction, and it also had a fire extinguisher <b>built</b> <b>into</b> it.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major fire}} {{occurred}} on May 11, 1969 in building 776/777 (the Plutonium Processing Facility), again starting due to spontaneous combustion of plutonium shavings in a glove box. Fire fighters again resorted to fighting {{the fire with}} water after dry extinguishers proved ineffective. Despite recommendations after the 1957 fire, suppression systems were not <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the glove boxes.|$|E

5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E
5|$|El Castillo, {{also known}} as Kukulcán's Pyramid, is a Mesoamerican step-pyramid built in the centre of Mayan center of Chichen Itza in Mexico. Several {{architectural}} features have suggested astronomical elements. Each of the stairways <b>built</b> <b>into</b> {{the sides of the}} pyramid has 91 steps. Along with the extra one for the platform at the top, this totals 365 steps, which is possibly one for each day of the year (365.25) or the number of lunar orbits in 10,000 rotations (365.01).|$|E
5|$|GE and SNECMA {{also tested}} the {{effectiveness}} of chevrons on reducing jet noise. After examining configurations in the wind tunnel, CFMI chose to flight-test chevrons <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the core exhaust nozzle. The chevrons reduced jet noise by 1.3 perceived loudness decibels during takeoff conditions, and are now offered as an option with the CFM56 for the Airbus A321.|$|E

5|$|Gate towers, one on {{each side}} of the gate and {{projecting}} out from the gate to allow defenders to shoot into the area in front of the entrance. The gates themselves were normally wooden with metal covering plates to prevent destruction by fire. Some gates had portcullises.

5|$|Holographic weapon sights {{are similar}} in layout to {{reflector}} sights but do not use a projected reticle system. Instead, a representative reticle is recorded in three-dimensional space onto holographic film {{at the time of}} manufacture. This image is part of the optical viewing window. The recorded hologram is illuminated by a collimated laser <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the sight. The sight can be adjusted for range and windage by simply tilting or pivoting the optical window.|$|E
