50|$|Small wind turbines, {{particularly}} self-build designs, {{are widely}} adopting magneto alternators for their generators. These use rotating neodymium rare-earth magnets with a three-phase stator, then a bridge rectifier to produce DC. This is then used either directly for water-pumping, stored in batteries, or {{used to drive}} a mains inverter which can supply the grid system for profit. These designs have been encouraged {{by one of the}} most popular self-build designs, described in Hugh Piggott's series of books and courses. A typical design here is an axial-flux generator recycled from a car <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> and hub bearing. A MacPherson strut provides the azimuth bearing to bring the turbine into the wind. The <b>brake</b> <b>disk,</b> and its attached rare-earth magnets, rotates to form the armature. A plywood disk carrying multiple axial coils is placed alongside this, with a further iron armature ring behind it.|$|E

40|$|Circular air-coupled {{ultrasonic}} testing (ACUT) setup for the inspection of commercial carbon-carbon composite aircraft <b>brake</b> <b>disks</b> {{was developed in}} Intelligent Measurement and Evaluation Laboratory (IMEL) at Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC). The developed test setup utilizes Airstar single channel air-coupled equipment and has only manual A-scan and B-scan capability. The developed ACUT technique is unique compared to the commercial C-scan ultrasonic systems and is proficient, fast, economically feasible, and easy to implement method particularly for the inspection of carbon-carbon (C/C) composites aircraft <b>brake</b> <b>disks.</b> Prior to conducting air-coupled measurements, wobble analysis was carried out. This was important because significant wobbling in the test setup {{can lead to the}} interference of the reflected and the incident beam which would result to inaccurate ultrasonic measurements. The measured deviation due to wobbling, surface profile of the disk, design, and experimental error were relatively small. Therefore, these errors were neglected while performing ACUT measurements. For ACUT measurements, several through-transmitted amplitude signals were recorded within the C/C <b>brake</b> <b>disks</b> manually. The images were then reconstructed using Matlab based on the through-transmitted amplitude signals. Finally, a comparison was drawn between the reconstructed images and the C-scan images of the C/C <b>brake</b> <b>disks</b> obtained from the commercial Airstar C-scan ACUT system. Like commercial C-scan ACUT image results, reconstructed images were also able to detect all defects in the commercial C/C <b>brake</b> <b>disks</b> which served for the system verification and validation. In addition, defect, non-defect, and suspected areas within the C/C <b>brake</b> <b>disks</b> were quantified with air-coupled measurement. For this, light microscopy was conducted for every sample made from each C/C <b>brake</b> <b>disks</b> at lower magnification of 10 X. It was concluded that {{it is very difficult to}} assess the crack or delamination situation based on a 2 D micrograph of one depth. Also, it was concluded that an internal porosity and micro-cracks may not be only factors that can be related to defects. Finally, an intelligent systems approach, specifically, fuzzy logic and artificial neural network (ANN) methodologies were implemented for the automatic defect detection in commercial C/C aircraft <b>brake</b> <b>disks</b> by using air-coupled ultrasonic results. For this, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with two hidden layers and a scaled conjugate gradient back-propagation (BP) learning algorithm was used for the ANN training. The network training process was performed in an off-line mode using the ANN toolbox in Matlab. The network training was repeated until a steady state was reached, where there was no further change in the synaptic weights. The ANN provided plausible results in detecting the defect areas for different C/C <b>brake</b> <b>disks.</b> It was also demonstrated that the system was able to learn the rules without knowing any algorithm for automatic defect detection...|$|R

Since 1988, DLR has developed so called C/C-SiC materials via a three step manufacturing route based on the infiltration of liquid silicon into porous carbon/carbon. Especially for automotive <b>brake</b> <b>disks,</b> the costs of the carbon fabrics and of the common processing techniques for the CFRP preform, like resin transfer moulding or autoclave technique, are too high for a serial production. The most promising way to reduce the costs for the <b>brake</b> <b>disks</b> and to simplify the CFRP manufacture is using a short fibre reinforcement and applying hot pressing techniques. In different tribological test campaigns the performance and the excellent wear resistance of <b>brake</b> <b>disks</b> with short fibre reinforcement were proven. Due to their high thermal stability and their low weight, a great leap in brake technology could be achieved, combining non-fading characteristics with better driving dynamics.

50|$|Electric retarders use {{electromagnetic}} induction {{to provide a}} retardation force. An electric retardation unit can be placed on an axle, transmission, or driveline and consists of a rotor attached to the axle, transmission, or driveline—and a stator securely attached to the vehicle chassis. There are no contact surfaces between the rotor and stator, and no working fluid. When retardation is required, the electrical windings in the stator receive power from the vehicle battery, producing a magnetic field through which the rotor moves. This induces eddy currents in the rotor, which produces an opposing magnetic field to the stator. The opposing magnetic fields slows the rotor, and hence the axle, transmission or driveshaft {{to which it is}} attached. The rotor incorporates internal vanes (like a ventilated <b>brake</b> <b>disk)</b> to provide its own air cooling, so no load is placed on the vehicle's engine cooling system. The operation of the system is extremely quiet.|$|E

40|$|Lamellar {{gray cast}} iron, with a mainly {{pearlitic}} microstructure, {{is widely used}} in the automotive industry, mostly in the manufacturing of <b>brake</b> <b>disks.</b> This work analyzes in depth the effects of small variations of titanium content on the microstructure and mechanical properties of cast iron <b>brake</b> <b>disks.</b> For this purpose, eight different heats of EN-GJL- 250 cast iron were selected, with a similar chemical composition but with different titanium contents, varying from 0. 013 to 0. 031 %. The drops in mechanical strength and hardness values measured on the high-Ti samples were correlated to microstructural variations quantitatively observed by means of optical and scanning electron microscope. It was found that titanium combines to form titanium nitrides, suppressing the beneficial microstructural effects of nitrogen at solidification. Residual nitrogen, if present in sufficient quantity, promotes the nucleation of primary austenite from the liquid {{and the formation of}} a fine microstructure, with small eutectic cells and lower graphite content. Such a microstructure provides <b>brake</b> <b>disks</b> with better mechanical properties. The interpretation of results was further supported by thermal analysis and thermodynamic calculations...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of thermoelastic contact problem of functionally graded (FG) rotating <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> with heat source due to contact friction is presented. Finite element method (FEM) is used. The material properties of disk {{are assumed to}} be represented by power-law distributions in the radial direction. The inner and outer surfaces considered are metal and ceramic, respectively. Pure material is considered for the brake pad. Coulomb contact friction is assumed as the heat source. It is divided into two equal parts between pad and <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> which leads to thermal stresses. Mechanical response of FG disks are compared and verified with the known results from the literatures. The results show that the maximum value of radial displacement in mounted FG <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> is not at outer surface. It is found that the all areas between pad and <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> is in full-contact status when the ratio of pad thickness to <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> thickness is 0. 66. It is observed that the total strain due to thermomechanical load is negative for some parts of the disks, whereas, the thermal strains are always positive. It can be concluded that gradation index of the metal-ceramic has significant effect in the thermomechanical response of FG disks. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{transient}} {{and contact}} analysis of functionally graded (FG) <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> is presented. The analysis {{was carried out}} using ANSYS parametric design language (APDL). The FG <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> is made of metal-ceramic material. The material properties vary in radial direction with the values from full-metal at the inner radius to that of full-ceramic at the outer radius. In the analysis, FG <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> is in contact with one pure pad disk and coulomb contact friction is considered as heat source. The non-dimensional results are obtained for specific value of grading index (n = 1) by considering different material property divisions of 25, 50, 100 and 200. The results presented are for the pressure distribution, total stress, pad penetration, friction stress, heat flux and temperature during contact, for different values of contact stiffness factor, F-kn, which depends on the property gradation of FG <b>brake</b> <b>disk</b> with 200 material property divisions. The {{results show that the}} contact pressure and contact total stress increase with increasing values of F-kn, and hence it can be concluded that gradation of the metal-ceramic has significant effect in the thermomechanical response of FG brake disks.
