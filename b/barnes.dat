5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62. Bradman joined <b>Barnes</b> and the Australian skipper {{played and}} missed {{a few times}} before {{settling}} down. <b>Barnes</b> responded to his captain's difficulties by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the second new ball. Generally however, <b>Barnes</b> also scored sedately after lunch, and after one extended period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, eliciting a round of ironic applause. <b>Barnes</b> responded to the public gallery by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and bowing to the spectators. <b>Barnes</b> had started slowly, but accelerated after reaching his half-century. He reached 96 with Australia at 1/222 half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} run-scoring, <b>Barnes,</b> who {{was well known}} for being eccentric, gained fame {{throughout}} the season for his fielding at short leg—just a few metres from the batsman—where he took 19 catches for the season. <b>Barnes</b> stood much closer than others who fielded in the position, placing {{one foot on the}} edge of the pitch. His extreme proximity prompted questions about the legitimacy of his action and English captain Norman Yardley later admitted that <b>Barnes</b> had intimidated his batsmen.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{came out}} to bat halfway through the middle session on the second day, after England had ended on 363. Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia with only one {{specialist}} opener, Morris. Johnson—a bowler—was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener and fell for one. On the third morning, <b>Barnes</b> {{came out to}} bat upon Keith Miller's dismissal at 4/135, {{even though he had}} collapsed from the aftereffects of his injury while practising in the nets. <b>Barnes</b> had refused to stay in hospital and returned to the ground despite his ribs being discoloured from the bruising. Bradman was not aware of Barnes's collapse in the nets, but had told all rounder Sam Loxton to bat before <b>Barnes</b> to give the bruised opener more rest. Loxton told <b>Barnes</b> of Bradman's wishes, but when Miller was dismissed, <b>Barnes</b> defied team orders and walked out to bat, shaking Pollard's hand at the start of his innings.|$|E
50|$|In 1744 Sotterley manor {{was sold}} to Miles <b>Barne,</b> {{the son of a}} London merchant, who rebuilt Sotterley Hall {{following}} a fire. The parish was enclosed in 1796 leaving his son Miles <b>Barne,</b> with 1085 acre, as the largest landholder. The <b>Barne</b> family still owns the house. Notable members of the <b>Barne</b> family to have lived at Sotterley include Frederick <b>Barne,</b> M.P. for the rotten borough of Dunwich {{at the time of the}} 1832 Reform Act, his son Frederick St John Newdigate <b>Barne,</b> M.P. for East Suffolk from 1876 to 1885 and his son Michael <b>Barne,</b> Royal Navy officer and the last surviving member of the 1901-04 Discovery Expedition to Antarctica.|$|R

5|$|Australia {{had less}} than 15 minutes of batting before the {{scheduled}} close of play. <b>Barnes</b> made an unsuccessful appeal against the light after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Edrich. Morris and <b>Barnes</b> successfully negotiated the new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss. Ideal batting conditions and clear weather greeted {{the players on the}} second day. <b>Barnes</b> and Morris took the score to 73 before Morris was bowled by Laker's off spin. Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 when <b>Barnes</b> cut Laker onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Evans. The ball bounced away and the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss <b>Barnes</b> for 62. Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to Australia's total. He failed to pick Laker's arm ball, which went straight on, clipped the outside edge and was taken at slip by Edrich.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} lineup for the Second Test at Lord's, {{the home of}} cricket. Before the match, <b>Barnes</b> wagered £8 at 15/1 on himself to score a century, and trained especially diligently in the lead-up to the Lord's fixture. He was motivated because the Australian Board of Control had given his wife rare permission to attend the match, and the refusal of the authorities at Lord's {{to allow him to}} practise there when he was in London a year earlier; <b>Barnes</b> saw a strong personal performance as an ideal response to what he regarded as a snub. On the first morning, Bradman won the toss and elected to bat, and <b>Barnes</b> continued his run of low scores since the First Test. The first over bowled by Bedser to <b>Barnes</b> was watchfully played to complete a maiden. The debutant Alec Coxon opened the bowling with Bedser and removed <b>Barnes</b> for a duck in his second over, caught by Len Hutton at short fine leg. <b>Barnes</b> tried to knock the short delivery through square leg but misjudged the pace of the wicket and played his shot too early, mishitting the ball to Hutton, and leaving Australia at 1/3. They eventually reached 350 and bowled England out for 215 early on the third day.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its strongest possible team in {{the tour}} opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. <b>Barnes</b> opened with Morris, while reserve opener Brown batted out of position in the middle order. The hosts won the toss and batted first, and <b>Barnes</b> took the last two catches as Australia dismissed them for 233. He delivered nine overs with his leg spin and was the most economical Australian bowler, conceding ten runs without taking a wicket. When Australia batted, <b>Barnes</b> made 44 from 104 balls in 99 minutes before being the first batsman to fall at 1/79.N- Australia reached 462 and dismissed the hosts for 212 to complete a victory by an innings and 17 runs. During the second innings, <b>Barnes</b> took his first wicket for the tour, having Laddy Outschoorn caught behind by Don Tallon to spark a collapse that saw the home side lose their last five wickets for 47 runs. <b>Barnes</b> ended with 1/25 and took two catches in the second innings; all four of his catches for the match were from spinners.|$|E

50|$|<b>Barne</b> <b>Barne</b> (25 August 1754 - 19 June 1828) was a British {{land-owner}} and a Member of Parliament for the Pocket Borough of Dunwich, in Suffolk, between 1777 and 1791. <b>Barne's</b> {{father had}} {{established himself as}} co-proprietor of the Borough and controlled one seat; on his father's death in 1777, <b>Barne's</b> eldest brother declined to fill the vacancy and so <b>Barne</b> accepted the offer, hoping to obtain, by voting with the administration, a paid office. He was eventually offered a post, as a Commissioner of Taxes, and, on accepting it, resigned his seat in 1791.|$|R
5|$|Australia's openers Morris and <b>Barnes</b> {{successfully}} {{negotiated the}} new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss after 15 minutes. Ideal batting conditions greeted {{the players on}} the second day. <b>Barnes</b> and Morris took the score to 73 before Laker removed Morris. Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 before <b>Barnes</b> was caught by wicket-keeper Evans with a one-handed diving effort for 62. Miller was then dismissed for a duck by Laker.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barnes</b> and Morris shared century opening {{partnerships}} at Lord's and The Oval, {{where their}} 117run stand dwarfed the 52all out {{made by the}} entire England team. In addition to his century at Lord's, <b>Barnes</b> made three other scores over 60 in the series.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barnes</b> and Morris {{took the}} score to 73 before {{the latter was}} out for 31 after two hours of batting. Bradman came in and Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. The hosts’ captain packed the leg side with fielders and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump. <b>Barnes</b> reached his half-century after 135 minutes at the crease with a pull for four from Charlie Barnett. The score progressed to 121 before <b>Barnes</b> cut Jim Laker onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans. The ball bounced away, but the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss <b>Barnes</b> for 62. Umpire Ernest Cooke was unsure of whether <b>Barnes</b> had hit {{the ball into the}} ground before Evans took the catch, and consulted with Chester, who had been standing at point {{on the other side of}} the field, before ruling the batsman out. Keith Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to leave Australia's total at 3/121. Australia went on to reach 509 all out on the third day, yielding a 344-run first innings lead.|$|E

50|$|Dunwich was a Parliamentary {{constituency}} in Suffolk, {{which had}} largely {{fallen into the}} sea and had a dwindling population by the late eighteenth century; it was home to roughly 40 voters. Thus, the voters could be compelled by their land-lords {{to vote for the}} land-lord’s favoured candidate. The <b>Barne</b> family, who had their seat in Sotterley, near Beccles, in Suffolk, had become the leading co-proprietors of Dunwich (along with the Vanneck family) and so controlled the vote. When <b>Barne’s</b> father, Miles, had resigned from the seat in 1777, <b>Barne</b> declined to take it up and his brother, <b>Barne</b> <b>Barne,</b> served instead.|$|R

5|$|<b>Barnes</b> lingered for {{a further}} ten minutes on 96 before {{reaching}} his century with a straight drive from Laker. He had taken 255 minutes and hit ten fours. After registering his century, <b>Barnes</b> became particularly aggressive. <b>Barnes</b> stepped out to attack Laker but missed; luckily for him, Evans failed to collect the ball as it turned down the leg side.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barnes</b> took {{advantage}} of his reprieve to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122, as Yardley made frequent bowling changes {{in an attempt to}} disrupt their progress. Wright came on and bowled a no ball, which Morris lofted into the crowd for six. Morris stopped shuffling, while <b>Barnes</b> decided to adopt a strategy of pre-emptively moving down the pitch to Laker. Earlier in the tour, <b>Barnes</b> had often been bowled or trapped lbw trying to force off breaks into the leg side. He drove Laker into the pavilion and Australia were 73/0 at lunch with Morris on 40 and <b>Barnes</b> 25, an overall lead of 208.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barnes</b> {{was also}} quiet after lunch, and after one {{long period of}} defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, {{eliciting}} a round of ironic applause. The Australian opener responded by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and bowing to the spectators. <b>Barnes</b> had started slowly, but he accelerated after reaching his half-century. Bradman took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty. This left <b>Barnes</b> on 96 and Australia at 222/1, half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E

5|$|<b>Barnes</b> {{was born}} in 1916 in Annandale, an inner suburb of Sydney. However, in his autobiography, {{he claims to have}} been born in 1918 or 1919 in Queensland, and his {{military}} service record has his date of birth as 5 June 1917. He was the third child of Alfred Percival <b>Barnes</b> and Hilda May <b>Barnes</b> (née Jeffery), both from farming families near Tamworth in northern New South Wales. After marrying, the couple left Tamworth to take up a lease on a remote sheep station near Hughenden in North Queensland. Before Sid was born, Alfred died from typhoid fever, caused by drinking contaminated water on the family property. After his death, Hilda, widowed and pregnant with her latest child, moved to Sydney with her children and stayed with her sister, where Sid was born. From her husband's estate, Hilda <b>Barnes</b> mother was able to purchase and renovate real estate in Stanmore and Leichhardt,New South Wales, to let or sell. Later in life, <b>Barnes</b> would recount how, as a child, he used to collect the rents for his mother.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barnes</b> {{was born}} in the Small Heath area of Birmingham, in the shadow of St Andrew's, the home stadium of Birmingham City. Support for Birmingham City ran in the family; his uncle played for the club in the 1920s. In 1943, aged 14, he began work at the Post Office. He played {{football}} for the works team, and quickly received an invitation to play for Moor Green, one of the strongest amateur teams in the area. His performances for Moor Green resulted in interest from Birmingham City, and <b>Barnes</b> became part of their junior team, Birmingham City Colts. <b>Barnes</b> worked at the Post Office during the day, trained with Moor Green in the evening, and played for Birmingham City Colts at the weekend. However, the Colts stopped selecting <b>Barnes</b> after a clash of matches, in which <b>Barnes</b> chose to play for a local team instead of the Colts. <b>Barnes</b> then resumed playing for Moor Green.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barnes</b> was {{selected}} for New South Wales for the opening match of the 1937–38 season against Queensland making 68 in a rain-affected match. Against the touring New Zealanders, <b>Barnes</b> fell just short of his maiden first-class century, scoring 97. He appeared to have reached the landmark when scoring 127not out against Western Australia, but the New South Wales Cricket Association retrospectively deemed the match to be not of first-class status, angering <b>Barnes.</b> He finally scored his maiden first-class century (110) against Victoria in {{the final game of}} the season, completing his hundred while bleeding profusely after being struck on the jaw by a ball delivered by Ernie McCormick. As a result of his performances over the season (scoring over 800 runs, averaging 50.56), <b>Barnes</b> {{was selected}} as the youngest member of the Australian cricket team to tour England in 1938.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{had been}} a regular member of the Australian Test team since his debut in 1934, and {{immediately}} after World War II, he captained Australia in the inaugural Test against New Zealand. However, he was sidelined by injury in 194647 and Sid <b>Barnes</b> and Arthur Morris opened in the Tests, averaging 73.83 and 71.85 respectively. Brown resumed his Test career in the following season, replacing <b>Barnes,</b> but he was dropped after scoring 29 runs in two Tests. <b>Barnes</b> then came in and made 139 runs {{in the next two}} Tests, including a 112 in the Fourth Test. Morris was then rested for the Fifth Test to allow Brown another chance to show his ability and make a case for continued national selection, and he made 99. In the Tests against India during the season, <b>Barnes,</b> Morris and Brown had shared the opening duties; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively. In any case, Brown had done enough to tour England with The Invincibles in 1948, his third trip there, although <b>Barnes</b> and Morris were the first-choice opening combination.|$|E
