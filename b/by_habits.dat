2500|$|In his 1989 posthumous book, The Global Village, McLuhan, {{collaborating with}} Bruce R. Powers, {{provided}} a strong {{conceptual framework for}} understanding the cultural implications of the technological advances associated {{with the rise of}} a worldwide electronic network. This is a major work of McLuhan's because it contains the most extensive elaboration of his concept of Acoustic Space, and it provides a critique of standard 20th century communication models like the Shannon–Weaver model. McLuhan distinguishes between the existing worldview of Visual Space – a linear, quantitative, classically geometric model – and that of Acoustic Space – a holistic, qualitative order with a complex intricate paradoxical topology. [...] "Acoustic Space has the basic character of a sphere whose focus or center is simultaneously everywhere and whose margin is nowhere." [...] The transition from Visual to Acoustic Space was not automatic {{with the advent of the}} global network, but would have to be a conscious project. The [...] "universal environment of simultaneous electronic flow" [...] inherently favors right-brain Acoustic Space, yet we are held back <b>by</b> <b>habits</b> of adhering to a fixed point of view. There are no boundaries to sound. We hear from all directions at once. Yet Acoustic and Visual Space are in fact inseparable. The resonant interval is the invisible borderline between Visual and Acoustic Space. This is like the television camera that the Apollo 8 astronauts focused on the Earth after they had orbited the moon.|$|E

6000|$|Soured {{by his own}} want of success, {{jealous of}} the success of others, his natural {{irritability}} of temper increased <b>by</b> <b>habits</b> of intemperance, he at length abandoned himself to the practice of reviewing, and became one of the Ishmaelites of the press. In this his malignant bitterness soon gave him a notoriety which his talents {{had never been able to}} attain.

6000|$|Some attempts, the Squire informs me, {{have been}} made of late years, by men of both taste and learning, to rally back the popular feeling to these {{standards}} of primitive simplicity; but the time has gone by, the feeling has become chilled <b>by</b> <b>habits</b> of gain and traffic, the country apes the manners and amusements of the town, and little is heard of May-day at present, except from the lamentations of authors, who sigh after it from among the brick walls of the city: ...|$|E

60|$|Spike {{started in}} his bed; then he buried {{his face in}} the coverlet--and he {{actually}} groaned. In bitterness of spirit the woman turned away and wept. Her feelings had been blunted by misfortune and the collisions of a selfish world; but enough of former self remained to make this the hardest of all the blows she had ever received. Her husband, dying as he was, as he must and did know himself to be, shrunk from one of her appearance, unsexed as she had become <b>by</b> <b>habits,</b> and changed by years and suffering.|$|E
60|$|All {{his works}} are very valuable, though disagreeable when they {{touch on the}} worst vulgarities of modern life; and often much spoiled by a curiously mistaken type of face, divided so as to give too much to the mouth and eyes and leave too little for forehead, the eyes being set about two thirds up, instead of at half {{the height of the}} head. But his manner of work is always right; and his tragic power, though rarely developed, and warped <b>by</b> <b>habits</b> of caricature, is, in reality, as great as his {{grotesque}} power.|$|E
60|$|The metamorphosed horse-dealer was silenced of course, and slunk to the rear, {{where he}} consoled himself by {{entering}} into a vehement dispute upon {{the price of}} hay with a farmer who had reluctantly followed his laird to the field rather than give up his farm, whereof the lease had just expired. Waverley was therefore once more consigned to silence, foreseeing that further attempts at conversation {{with any of the}} party would only give Balmawhapple a wished-for opportunity to display the insolence of authority, and the sulky spite of a temper naturally dogged, and rendered more so <b>by</b> <b>habits</b> of low indulgence and the incense of servile adulation.|$|E

60|$|But {{while he}} {{rejected}} pure necessitarianism in its crude form as essentially a REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM of life, he was fully {{conscious of the}} fact that the will is not a mysterious and ultimate unit of force beyond which we cannot go and whose special characteristic is inconsistency, but a certain creative attitude of the mind which is, from the first, continually influenced <b>by</b> <b>habits,</b> education and circumstance; so absolutely modifiable, in a word, that the good and the bad man alike seem to lose the power of free will; for the one is morally unable to sin, the other physically incapacitated for reformation.|$|E
6000|$|Such speeches {{as these}} made a {{powerful}} {{impression on the}} men to whom they were addressed, already hardened, <b>by</b> <b>habits</b> and sentiments, against a sense of danger. The chivalrous Normans swore, on the cross of their swords, they would die to a man ere they would surrender their posts--the blunter Anglo-Saxons cried, [...] "Shame on him who would render up such a lamb as Eveline to a Welsh wolf, while he could make her a bulwark with his body!"-- Even the cold Flemings caught a spark of the enthusiasm with which the others were animated, and muttered to each other praises of the young lady's beauty, and short but honest resolves {{to do the best}} they might in her defence.|$|E
60|$|I am {{clear for}} public schools as the general rule; but for {{particular}} children private education may be proper. For the purpose of moving at ease in the best English society,--mind, I don't call the London exclusive clique the best English society,--the defect of a public education upon the plan of our great schools and Oxford and Cambridge is hardly to be supplied. But the defect is visible positively in some men, and only negatively in others. The first offend you <b>by</b> <b>habits</b> and modes of thinking and acting directly attributable to their private education; in the others you only regret that the freedom and facility of the established and national mode of bringing up is not added to their good qualities.|$|E

60|$|And {{thus for}} a {{fortnight}} matters went on. That any but the weakest and silliest of {{people could have}} seen in one interview that Lord Verisopht, {{though he was a}} lord, and Sir Mulberry Hawk, though he was a baronet, were not persons accustomed to be the best possible companions, and were certainly not calculated <b>by</b> <b>habits,</b> manners, tastes, or conversation, to shine with any very great lustre in the society of ladies, need scarcely be remarked. But with Mrs Wititterly the two titles were all sufficient; coarseness became humour, vulgarity softened itself down into the most charming eccentricity; insolence took the guise of an easy absence of reserve, attainable only by those who had {{had the good fortune to}} mix with high folks.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not feel}} now the logical force of the process that must have {{convinced}} me then that I had made my sacrifice and spent my strength in vain. At no time had I been under any illusion that the Tory party had higher ideals than any other party, yet {{it came to me}} like a thing newly discovered that the men I had to work with had for the most part no such dreams, no sense of any collective purpose, no atom of the faith I held. They were just as immediately intent upon personal ends, just as limited <b>by</b> <b>habits</b> of thought, as the men in any other group or party. Perhaps I had slipped unawares for a time into the delusions of a party man--but I do not think so.|$|E
60|$|By inheritance, by tradition, <b>by</b> <b>habits</b> of thought, Austen Vane was an American,--an American as {{differentiated}} {{from the}} citizen {{of any other}} nation upon the earth. The French have an expressive phrase in speaking of a person as belonging to this or that world, meaning the circle by which {{the life of an}} individual is bounded; the true American recognizes these circles--but with complacency, and with a sure knowledge of his destiny eventually to find himself within the one for which he is best fitted by his talents and his tastes. The mere fact that Victoria had been brought up amongst people with whom he had nothing in common would not have deterred Austen Vane from pressing his suit; considerations of honour had stood in the way, and hope had begun to whisper that these might, in the end, be surmounted. Once they had disappeared, and she loved him, that were excuse and reason enough.|$|E

6000|$|... § 25. III. It is assuredly {{connected}} {{also with}} a diseased state of health. Cheerfulness is just as natural {{to the heart of}} a man in strong health as color to his cheek; and wherever there is habitual gloom, there must be either bad air, unwholesome food, improperly severe labor, or erring habits of life. Among mountains, all these various causes are frequently found in combination. The air is either too bleak, or it is impure; generally the peasants are exposed to alternations of both. Great hardship is sustained in various ways, severe labor undergone during summer, and a sedentary and confined life led during winter. Where the gloom exists in less elevated districts, as in Germany, I do not doubt, though I have not historical knowledge enough to prove this, that it is partly connected with habits of sedentary life, protracted study, and general derangement of the bodily system in consequence; when it exists in the gross form exhibited in the manuscript above examined, I have no doubt it has been fostered <b>by</b> <b>habits</b> of general vice, cruelty, and dissipation.|$|E
60|$|But Gager at {{the present}} moment had {{achieved}} a triumph in the matter which he {{was not at all}} disposed to share with his elder officer. Perhaps, on the whole, more power is lost than gained <b>by</b> <b>habits</b> of secrecy. To be discreet is a fine thing,--especially for a policeman; but when discretion is carried to such a length in the direction of self-confidence as to produce a belief that no aid is wanted for the achievement of great results, it will often militate against all achievement. Had Scotland Yard been less discreet and more confidential, the mystery might, perhaps, have been sooner unravelled. Gager at this very moment had reason to believe that a man whom he knew could,--and would, if operated upon duly,--communicate to him, Gager, the secret of the present whereabouts of Patience Crabstick! That belief was a great possession, and much too important, as Gager thought, to be shared lightly with such an one as Mr. Bunfit,--a thick-headed sort of man, in Gager's opinion, although, no doubt, he had by means of industry been successful in some difficult cases.|$|E
60|$|Rebecca was now {{to expect}} a fate even more dreadful than that of Rowena; for what {{probability}} was there that either softness or ceremony would be used towards one of her oppressed race, whatever shadow of these might be preserved towards a Saxon heiress? Yet had the Jewess this advantage, that she was better prepared <b>by</b> <b>habits</b> of thought, and by natural strength of mind, to encounter the dangers to which she was exposed. Of a strong and observing character, even from her earliest years, the pomp and wealth which her father displayed within his walls, or which she witnessed in the houses of other wealthy Hebrews, {{had not been able}} to blind her to the precarious circumstances under which they were enjoyed. Like Damocles at his celebrated banquet, Rebecca perpetually beheld, amid that gorgeous display, the sword which was suspended over the heads of her people by a single hair. These reflections had tamed and brought down to a pitch of sounder judgment a temper, which, under other circumstances, might have waxed haughty, supercilious, and obstinate.|$|E
