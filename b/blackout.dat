5|$|In Canada, <b>Blackout</b> debuted {{atop the}} Canadian Albums Chart {{with sales of}} 29,000 units, {{becoming}} her first number-one album there since Britney (2001). It was certified platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) for shipments of 100,000 copies. In Australia and New Zealand, <b>Blackout</b> debuted at numbers three and eight on the official charts, respectively. It was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) indicating shipments of 70,000 units. <b>Blackout</b> debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart with sales of 42,000 units, only behind Long Road Out of Eden. It stayed on the chart for twenty-eight weeks. It was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 100,000 copies. In Ireland, the album debuted atop the Irish Albums Chart, replacing Bruce Springsteen's Magic. <b>Blackout</b> also debuted atop the European Top 100 Albums, holding off Long Road Out of Eden and Eros Ramazzotti's e² from reaching {{the top of the}} chart. The album had consistent performance across Europe, reaching the top ten in ten markets, including debuting at number four in Switzerland, number six in Austria, Italy and Denmark, and number ten in Germany and Portugal. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), the album was the thirty-second best-selling album of 2007. By the end of 2008, <b>Blackout</b> had sold 3.1million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Low-altitude {{intercepts}} {{would also}} {{have the advantage of}} reducing the problem with nuclear <b>blackout.</b> The lower edge of an extended fireball used to induce nuclear <b>blackout</b> extended down to about 60km, the same as the altitude at which decluttering became effective. Hence, low-altitude intercepts meant that deliberate attempts to create a <b>blackout</b> would not affect the operation of the Sprint missile. Just as importantly, because the Sprint's own warheads would be going off far below this altitude, their fireballs would be much smaller and only black out {{a small portion of the}} sky. The radar would have to survive the electrical effects of EMP, and significant effort was expended on this. It also meant that the threat tube trajectories would have to be developed rapidly, before or between <b>blackout</b> periods. This demanded a very high-performance computer, one that did not exist at that time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Thousands of {{disturbances}} {{occurred in}} the modern power systems {{every year in the}} world. Some of them led to <b>blackouts.</b> Large scale <b>blackouts</b> rarely happened in power systems, but they caused enormous economical and social damages. In order to prevent future <b>blackouts,</b> {{it is very important to}} review the previous large scale incidents and to draw their common characteristics. This paper analyzes some major <b>blackouts</b> in the world, classifies their features in each phase and summarizes their mechanisms...|$|R

5|$|Upon its release, <b>Blackout</b> {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics; some complimented it as Spears' most progressive and consistent album. The Times named {{it as the}} fifth best pop album of the decade. <b>Blackout</b> was originally scheduled to be released on November 13 in the United States, though it was ultimately rush-released after several unauthorized internet leaks. It was expected to debut at {{number one on the}} US Billboard 200, but debuted at number two with first-week sales of 290,000 copies after a last-minute rule change. Consequently, <b>Blackout</b> is distinguished as Spears' first studio album not to debut at number one in the United States, although it was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for exceeding one million shipments. The album charted in within the top ten of several national charts internationally, and has attained several certifications worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{transmission}} system's reputation and the fact Quebec escaped unscathed from the Northeast <b>Blackout</b> of 2003, the system has experienced damage and service interruptions from severe storms in the past. Examples include the 1982 and 1988 Quebec blackouts prior to the large 1989 and 1998 power interruptions.|$|E
5|$|Much of Quebec's {{population}} {{is served by}} a few 735kV power lines. This contributed to {{the severity of the}} power outage following the North American ice storm of 1998. The extent and duration of this <b>blackout</b> has generated criticism of the transmission system, and there is controversy concerning the use of hydroelectric dams.|$|E
50|$|Rolling <b>blackouts</b> have {{occurred}} unexpectedly in late July 2015 due to extremely hot weather {{which made the}} power stations to reduce their output. There is possibility that rolling <b>blackouts</b> may occur in the following summers for the same reason. However, contrary to 1970/80s outages, in these emergency <b>blackouts</b> the industry is cut off first, the power flow to the houses is usually uninterrupted.|$|R
30|$|The Indian {{power system}} {{underwent}} two separate massive <b>blackouts</b> on 30 th and 31 st of July 2012. These <b>blackouts</b> exposed {{a series of}} inherent problems underlying the power system of India, such as its generation planning, transmission planning, grid infrastructure, management systems, primary energy resources, environmental constraints, electricity market, and information technology, which together aggravate the massive <b>blackouts.</b> These factors which affect the adequacy and security of the power supply {{in a similar manner}} as the transmission congestion of physical grids does, can be called by a generic term as generalized congestion. Competitive manipulations and “game-playing” between various interested parties further intensifies these congestions. Here, from the perspective of generalized congestions, the paper reflects the inevitability of India’s massive <b>blackouts,</b> discusses occasional effects of trigger events, inherent evolution law of <b>blackouts</b> and the enlightenment on power industry in China, and explores risk control measures to defend <b>blackouts</b> in China. The positive role of strong smart grid in insuring energy and environment security is highlighted.|$|R
50|$|The {{frequent}} Ghanaian <b>blackouts</b> {{are caused}} by a power supply shortage. Ghanaian generating capacity is currently 400-600 megawatts less than Ghana needs. Ghanaian electricity distributors regularly shed load with rolling <b>blackouts.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 22 July 1936, Charles Lindbergh {{departed}} Penshurst for Staaken Airfield, Berlin, {{which was}} a Luftwaffe airfield closed to civil aircraft. Lindbergh {{had been invited to}} Berlin by Hermann Göring. A press <b>blackout</b> was imposed on the orders of Adolf Hitler. Lindbergh made a speech to the Aero Club in Berlin which was reported in Der Volkische Beobachter.|$|E
5|$|The flight {{took off}} from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport at 20:18 Eastern Daylight Time (00:18 UTC, September 3). From 20:33 EDT (00:33 UTC) until 20:47 EDT (00:47 UTC), the {{aircraft}} experienced a 14-minute radio <b>blackout,</b> which was later determined {{to be due to}} communication radios tuning errors.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{literature}} data the authors show, that radiological diagnostics of pleura SPE illnesses conducting syndrome {{is based on the}} classical description, the main attribute of which is <b>blackouts</b> and so-called Sokolov-Ellis-Damuazo line. The authors have reported the clinical data of the syndrom PE diagnostics in 397 patients and shown that a "classical" radiological picture occurred only in 31 % of the cases (the 4 -th radiological variant of PE), the 1 -st - in 11 % (parietal <b>blackouts),</b> 2 -nd - in 7 % (above diaphragmatic <b>blackouts</b> of the bottom lung field), 3 -rd - in 44 % (osseous or cardiac diaphragmatic sine <b>blackouts),</b> 5 -th - in 5 % (total or subtotal hemithorax <b>blackouts),</b> 6 -th - in 0, 75 % (paramediastinal <b>blackouts),</b> 7 -th - in 0, 5 % (arch diaphragm deformation). Knowledge of the given phenomena will facilitate the work of experts on beam diagnostics at verification of PE syndrome, and of clinical physicians - at the further verification of a pleura illness.

5|$|As of December 2010, South Australia had {{thirteen}} operational wind farms, with an {{installed capacity}} of 1,018 MW. By August 2014 this has increased to 1,473 MW, accounting for 27 per cent of electricity production. As of late 2015 {{there are a}} large range of new wind farms {{in various stages of}} planning but only one under construction, the Hornsdale Wind Farm. Hornsdale was generating 86 MW immediately prior to the 2016 South Australian <b>blackout</b> in September 2016.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blackout</b> is {{the fifth}} studio album by American singer Britney Spears. It was {{released}} on October 25, 2007 through Jive Records. Opting to re-establish her music career after her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003), she began planning the project in 2006. Work continued into 2007, during which time Spears' much-publicized personal struggles, including several instances of erratic behavior and her divorce from Kevin Federline overshadowed her professional endeavors.|$|E
40|$|Large <b>blackouts</b> are {{typically}} caused by cascading failure propagating through a power system {{by means of}} a variety of processes. Because of the wide range of time scales, multiple interacting processes, and the huge number of possible interactions, the simulation and analysis of cascading <b>blackouts</b> is extremely complicated. This paper defines cascading failure for <b>blackouts</b> and gives an initial review of the current understanding, industrial tools, and the challenges and emerging methods of analysis and simulation.

5000|$|Research {{indicates}} that some users of alcohol, particularly {{those with a}} history of <b>blackouts,</b> are predisposed to experience <b>blackouts</b> more frequently than others. [...] One such study indicated a link between prenatal exposure to alcohol and vulnerability towards <b>blackouts,</b> in addition to the oft-cited link between this type of exposure and alcoholism. [...] Alternatively, another study has indicated that {{there appears to be a}} genetic predisposition towards blacking out, suggesting that some individuals are made to be susceptible to alcohol-related amnesia.|$|R
5|$|<b>Blackout</b> {{represents}} a musical departure from Spears' earlier work featuring a foreboding and atmospheric tone {{in terms of}} musical and lyrical direction. She collaborated with producers including Danja, Bloodshy & Avant, Sean Garrett, and The Neptunes in several recording studios around the United States, including Spears' home in Los Angeles, {{with the intention of}} creating uptempo, high-energy music. Their efforts resulted in a primarily dance-pop and electropop record, which sees additional influences from Euro disco, dubstep and funk. The lyrical themes revolve around love, fame, media scrutiny, sex, and clubbing.|$|E
5|$|In late January 1945 the Imperial General Headquarters belatedly {{adopted a}} civil defense plan {{to counter the}} American air raids. This plan {{assigned}} responsibility for fighting fires to community councils and neighborhood groups as the professional firefighting units were short-handed. Civilians were to observe a <b>blackout</b> from 10:00pm. Japanese positions in the Bonin Islands were normally able to provide an hour's warning of American raids and air raid sirens were sounded in cities threatened by attack.|$|E
5|$|In {{the major}} MRT {{disruption}} of 15 December 2011, one C151 train (trainset 067/068, T139 in the COI) was stalled {{in the tunnel}} and its backup battery failed. The passenger compartments in T139 experienced a <b>blackout</b> and loss of ventilation, leading to one passenger smashing a train door window to avoid suffocation. The battery failure led to criticism by the COI {{on the condition of}} the aging emergency batteries installed on all C151 trains. SMRT has since proposed an upgrading plan to address this issue.|$|E
