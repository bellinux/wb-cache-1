50|$|The Marform process, for example, {{operates}} {{using the}} principle of rubber pad forming techniques. Deep-recessed parts with either vertical or sloped walls can be formed. In this type of forming, the die rig employs a rubber pad as one tool half and a solid tool half, similar to the die in a conventional die set, to form a component into its final shape. Dies are made of cast light alloys and the rubber pad is 1.5-2 times thicker than the component to be formed. For Marforming, single-action presses are equipped with die cushions and blank holders. The blank is held against the rubber pad by a <b>blank</b> <b>holder,</b> through which a punch is acting as in conventional deep drawing. It is a double-acting apparatus: at first the ram slides down, then the <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> moves: this feature allows it to perform deep drawings (30-40% transverse dimension) with no wrinkles.|$|E

5000|$|Deep {{drawing is}} a {{sheet metal forming}} process in which a sheet metal blank is {{radially}} drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch. It is thus a shape transformation process with material retention. The process is considered [...] "deep" [...] drawing when {{the depth of the}} drawn part exceeds its diameter. This is achieved by redrawing the part through a series of dies. The flange region (sheet metal in the die shoulder area) experiences a radial drawing stress and a tangential compressive stress due to the material retention property. These compressive stresses (hoop stresses) result in flange wrinkles (wrinkles of the first order). Wrinkles can be prevented by using a <b>blank</b> <b>holder,</b> the function of which is to facilitate controlled material flow into the die radius.|$|E
50|$|The {{thinnest}} part thickness {{determines the}} maximum stress {{that can be}} transferred to the deformation zone. Due to material volume constancy, the flange thickens and results in <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> contact at the outer boundary rather than on the entire surface. The maximum stress that can be safely transferred from the punch to the blank sets a limit on the maximum blank size (initial blank diameter in the case of rotationally symmetrical blanks). An indicator of material formability is the limiting drawing ratio (LDR), defined as the ratio of the maximum blank diameter that can be safely drawn into a cup without flange to the punch diameter. Determination of the LDR for complex components is difficult and hence the part is inspected for critical areas for which an approximation is possible. During severe deep drawing the material work hardens and {{it may be necessary to}} anneal the parts in controlled atmosphere ovens to restore the original elasticity of the material.|$|E
50|$|The {{bolster plate}} {{is mounted on}} top of the press bed and is a large block of metal upon which the bottom portion of a die is clamped; the bolster plate is stationary. Large presses (like the ones used in the {{automotive}} industry) may be equipped die cushions integrated in the bolster plate to apply <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> or counter draw forces. This is necessary when a single acting press is used for deep drawing. The ram / slide is the moving or reciprocating member that the upper die is mounted to. Ram or Slide guidance is a critical element to assure long die life between die maintenance. Different types of slide guides are available, 4 point V-Gibs or 6 point square gibs on smaller presses and 8 point full length slide guides on larger straight side frame presses. With the dies and material be fed into the die between the bolster and slide, good press designs must account for plastic deformation, other wise known as defection when frame design and loads are considered.|$|E
5000|$|This {{process is}} based on the 1950s patent for hydramolding by Fred Leuthesser, Jr. and John Fox of the Schaible Company of Cincinnati, Ohio in the United States. It was {{originally}} used in producing kitchen spouts. This was done because in addition to the strengthening of the metal, hydromolding also produced less [...] "grainy" [...] parts, allowing for easier metal finishing.In sheet hydroforming (SHF) there are bladder forming (where there is a bladder that contains the liquid; no liquid contacts the sheet) and hydroforming where the fluid contacts the sheet (no bladder). Bladder forming is sometimes called flexforming. Flexforming is mostly used for low volume productions, as in the aerospace field.Forming with the fluid in direct contact with the part can be done either with a male solid punch (this version is sometimes called hydro-mechanical deep drawing) or with a female solid die.In hydro-mechanical deep drawing, a work piece is placed on a draw ring (<b>blank</b> <b>holder)</b> over a male punch then a hydraulic chamber surrounds the work piece and a relatively low initial pressure seats the work piece against the punch. The punch then is raised into the hydraulic chamber and pressure is increased to as high as 100 MPa (15000 psi) which forms the part around the punch. Then the pressure is released and punch retracted, hydraulic chamber lifted, and the process is complete.|$|E
50|$|A {{circular}} sheet (blank) of 118 mm diameter was {{cut from}} the alloy sheet and the cut surfaces polished to remove burrs. The blank {{was placed on the}} die and the top chamber brought in contact. The furnace was switched on to the set temperature. Once the set temperature was reached the top chamber was brought down further to effect the required <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> pressure. About 10 minutes were allowed for thermal equilibration. The argon gas cylinder was opened to the set pressure gradually. Simultaneously, the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT), fitted {{at the bottom of the}} die, was set for recording the sheet bulge. Once the LVDT reached 45 mm (radius of bottom die), gas pressure was stopped and the furnace switched off. The formed components were taken out when the temperature of the die set had dropped to 600 °C. Easy removal of the component was possible at this stage. Superplastic bulge forming of hemispheres were carried out at temperatures of 1098, 1123, 1148, 1173, 1198 and 1223 K (825, 850, 875, 900, 925 and 950 °C) at forming pressures of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.87 MPa. As the bulge forming process progresses, significant thinning in the sheet material becomes obvious. An ultrasonic technique was used to measure the thickness distribution on the profile of the formed component. The components were analyzed in terms of the thickness distribution, thickness strain and thinning factor. Post deformation micro-structural studies were conducted on the formed components in order to analyze the microstructure in terms of grain growth, grain elongation, cavitations, etc.|$|E

In this study, the mechanical properties of the material were chosen since that they equivalent to those of low carbon steel with its thickness of 0. 2 mm, K= 572 N/mm 2, UTS= 391 N/mm 2, yield stress= 309 N/mm 2 and n= 0. 2.

An experimental system was prepared which consisted of a hydraulic press capable of applying different loads on the sheet metal blank and a <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> and the process was controlled by a computer. All simulations were performed by using the ABAQUS/EXPLICIT V 6. 9 software, and the effect of different aluminium alloys, punch and die radius, <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> force, <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> gap, and friction coefficient on the wrinkling phenomenon has been investigated. Moreover, the minimal <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> force was obtained by plotting minor strain with respect to the major strain of produced cups, and obtaining the maximum height of wrinkle in a cup.

40|$|Abstract In {{deep drawing}} process, the <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> {{plays a key}} role in {{adjustment}} of metal flow into the die cavity. Moreover, the quality of drawn parts is extremely affected by this flow. There are two methods of treating the <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> in deep drawing and its simulation. One is <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> force (BHF) and the other is <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> gap (BHG), defined as the fixed distance between the <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> and the die surface. In previous studies, a large number of experimental techniques have been used to study BHF; however, the amount of theoretical and numerical simulation work to study BHG is insufficient. In the present study, the concept of BHG profile, i. e., variation of BHG over punch stroke is introduced and it is shown that a properly selected BHG profile can improve the section thickness of formed part and result in the drawing of deeper parts. Here, two methods for the opti-mization of BHG profile are devised, i. e., the local optimiza-tion and the global optimization methods. In the first ap-proach, the best BHG in each punch step is determined and finally, the local optimized BHG profile is achieved. In the second method, however, the empirical model for the predic-tion of final minimum section thickness in terms of BHG profile is obtained using design of experiments and neural networks. In the next stage, the proposed model is implanted into a simulated annealing optimization procedure to identify a proper BHG profile that can produce the desired blank thickness. Afterward, the BHG profile approach is applied to a variety of initial thicknesses, blank diameters, and materials in order to examine the robustness of method. In this paper, ABAQUS finite element package is used to gather finite element (FE) data and several experiments are performed to verify the FE results.

However, four extra sets of numerical simulation were carried out to compare with the value predicted using Response Surface Method (RSM). The good consistency confirms the effectiveness of this empirical equation within the plasticity field. With the assistance of the empirical model, it is feasible to acquire a fracture free product through regulating a suitable <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> force profile. The space variant <b>blank</b> <b>holder</b> system could be widely used to form a product with complicated shape, especially body panels in the automotive field.
