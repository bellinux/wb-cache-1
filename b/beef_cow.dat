25|$|A Texas Historical Marker {{notes that}} in the 1870s Hardin hid out in the {{vicinity}} of Pilgrim, Texas. After the Bell County shootings, Hardin found refuge with his cousins, the Clements, who were then living in Gonzales in south Texas. They suggested he could make money by driving cattle to Kansas as a cowboy. Thinking he could get out of Texas long enough for his pursuers to lose interest, Hardin worked with his cousins, rustling cattle for Jake Johnson and Columbus Carol. Hardin writes that he was made trail boss for the herd. In February 1871, while the herd was being collected for the drive to Kansas, a freedman, Bob King, attempted to cut a <b>beef</b> <b>cow</b> out of the herd. When he refused to obey Hardin's demand to stop, Hardin hit him over the head with his pistol. That same month, Hardin may have wounded three Mexicans in an argument over a Three-card Monte card game, pistol-whipping one man over the head, shooting one man in the arm, and shooting the third man in the lung.|$|E
2500|$|While driving cattle on the Chisholm Trail to Abilene, Kansas, in {{the summer}} of 1871, Hardin is reputed to have fought Mexican vaqueros and cattle rustlers. Towards the end of the drive, a Mexican herd crowded in behind Hardin's and there was some trouble keeping the two herds apart. Hardin {{exchanged}} words with {{the man in charge of}} the other herd; both men were on horseback. The Mexican fired his gun at Hardin, putting a hole through Hardin's hat. Hardin found that his own weapon, a worn-out cap-and-ball pistol with a loose cylinder, would not fire. He dismounted and managed to discharge the gun by steadying the cylinder with one hand and pulling the trigger with the other. He hit the Mexican in the thigh. A truce was declared and both parties went their separate ways. However, Hardin borrowed a pistol from a friend and went looking for the Mexican, this time fatally shooting him through the head. A firefight between the rival camps ensued. Hardin claimed six vaqueros died in the exchanges (five of them reportedly shot by him) although this claim appears exaggerated—only three Mexican vaqueros were killed. Hardin also claimed to have killed two Indians in separate gunfights on the same cattle drive. The first instance was when an Indian tried to shoot an arrow at him on the South Canadian River. Hardin shot him and then had the body buried to avoid retribution from the man's tribe. The second incident, at Bluff Creek, Kansas, occurred when Indians wanted to collect a [...] "tax" [...] on the cattle. Hardin hit an Indian over the head who he claimed had stolen a silver bridle from him. He then forced a war party to flee after he shot a second Indian who had killed a <b>beef</b> <b>cow.</b>|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryK C OlsonThe {{objective}} of this series of studies was to examine select factors that affect behavior of beef cattle grazing native-tallgrass rangelands. Mineral supplements with divergent palatability characteristics were delivered to <b>beef</b> <b>cows</b> grazing native tallgrass range during various seasons {{of the year in}} order to measure mineral intake, frequency of supplement use, and duration of supplement use. We concluded that molasses-based mineral supplements influenced the activities of grazing cows more strongly than salt-based mineral supplements. These influences extended to the amount of supplement consumed {{as well as to the}} frequency, duration, and timing of use. Diet selection preferences of experienced, multiparous <b>beef</b> <b>cows</b> and naïve, primiparous <b>beef</b> <b>cows</b> grazing dormant, native tallgrass pastures were examined also during a short-term winter grazing bout. Naïve, primiparous cows selected more forbs and fewer grasses than experienced, multiparous cows. Previous research indicated that preference for broadleaf plants generally increased with grazing experience; however, these conclusions were based on research with greater-quality forages than those evaluated in our study. The differences in diet selection patterns between experienced, multiparous cows and naïve, primiparous cows during a short-term winter grazing period could be indicative of differences in long-term foraging strategies. In addition, the botanical composition of diets grazed by lactating <b>beef</b> <b>cows</b> with suckling calves and non-pregnant, non-lactating <b>beef</b> <b>cows</b> grazing either burned or unburned native tallgrass prairie during summer were evaluated. There were no differences in botanical diet composition between lactating cows suckling calves and non-lactating cows. In contrast, total graminoid selection was greater on burned (74. 2 %) than unburned pastures (71. 8 %) and total forb selection was greater on unburned (28. 2 %) than burned pastures (25. 8 %). We interpreted these data to suggest that forage selection preferences of <b>beef</b> <b>cows</b> can be altered with spring burning of native tallgrass pastures. Effects of large, round hay bale feeding method on intake of smooth bromegrass hay and eating behavior by <b>beef</b> <b>cows</b> were examined on dormant tallgrass prairie pastures during winter. Three large, round hay bale-feeding systems were evaluated: bales fed in a ring feeder, bales unrolled on the ground, and bales chopped with a flail-type hay processor (20 -cm particle length) and deposited on the ground. Hay intake, hay refusal, frequency of use, and duration of use were not influenced by hay-feeding method. Foraging behaviors of <b>beef</b> <b>cows</b> in our studies were influenced by supplement type, cow age, and prescribed burning of rangeland. Conversely, foraging behaviors of <b>beef</b> <b>cows</b> were not influenced by lactation or by hay-feeding method...|$|R

In mountain, the herds with grazing land, produced a mean of 0. 78 calves/cow/year and net income averaged 289 %/cow/year.

40|$|Reproductive {{management}} of two-year-old <b>beef</b> <b>cows</b> presents a unique challenge in managing a beef herd, since {{this age group}} of females typically experiences the highest incidence of reproductive failure. Strategic {{management of}} replacement beef heifers and primiparous cows is necessary to ensure their continued long-term reproductive success, which provides the opportunity for beef producers to increase retention rates, reduce input costs, and ultimately enhance production efficiency. Estrus synchronization and artificial insemination (AI) are important management tools available to producers that facilitate genetic improvement and enhance reproductive efficiency. A list of recommended protocols {{may be used to}} facilitate fixed-time AI (FTAI) in <b>beef</b> <b>cows</b> and heifers, and we now know that specific protocols perform better among various age classes of females. Short-term controlled internal drug release (CIDR) -based protocols are currently the preferred method to synchronize estrus prior to FTAI in postpartum <b>beef</b> <b>cows.</b> Alternatively, long-term CIDR-based protocols have been used with greater success in beef heifers. Two experiments were designed to evaluate long-term CIDR-based estrus synchronization protocols specifically in two-year-old <b>beef</b> <b>cows.</b> Experiment 1 compared the 14 -d CIDR-PG and 7 -d CO-Synch + CIDR protocols. Although estrous response following treatment with the 14 -d CIDR-PG protocol was low, high pregnancy rates following AI were achieved after treatment with each protocol. Pregnancy rates {{at the end of the}} breeding season were similar between treatment groups, and a high percentage of cows in each group conceived within the first 30 days of the breeding season. The results from this experiment suggested that split-time AI (STAI), or delayed insemination of non-estrous females 24 h after the standard FTAI, could be used to improve estrous response and AI pregnancy rate in two-year-old <b>beef</b> <b>cows</b> following synchronization of estrus with the 14 -d CIDR-PG protocol. This hypothesis was tested in Experiment 2. The results from Experiment 2 indicated that total estrous response was improved with STAI; however, pregnancy rates were not improved. These experiments demonstrated that the 14 -d CIDR-PG and 7 -d CO-Synch + CIDR protocols can be used successfully to synchronize estrus prior to FTAI in primiparous two-year-old <b>beef</b> <b>cows.</b> These protocols provide the opportunity to expedite genetic improvement with FTAI, in addition to the opportunity they provide in facilitating enhanced reproductive management within a herd...|$|R

50|$|The term 'topline' {{refers to}} the back of the cow being judged in the showring. On a cow, it should be straight, however, the cow is not a board, and should {{therefore}} have a slight bend in the back, as well as having a relaxed back.As a bull gets older, he develops a hump on his neck. This is a normal characteristic of bulls from all breeds, and it is only worrying to the judge if the hump, or crest, is not there. When the bull is young, the crest will not be as noticeable, but as he gets older, it will become a lot more obvious.With some breeds, such as the Brahman, the hump will be above the shoulder. Once again, breed characteristics are important aspects of judging, and the judge hired for the event will have a lot of knowledge on the breed characteristics of that breed he or she is judging, and usually the judges specialize in only a few breeds because of this reason.The shoulder blades on a cow should be neat- they should be the same on either side of the back, and they shouldn't stick out too much- on a <b>beef</b> <b>cow,</b> this area should have some muscle. The shoulder blades should also be set in line with the spine- if they are not, the cow could be structurally incorrect. As with the shoulder blades, all joints in the back should be level with the spine, from the shoulder blades to the hip and the pins of the cow. However, some cows' pins do sit slightly lower than the spine. This is acceptable, but it is undesirable for any of the joints to drop off from the spine too much. If joints are set too low from the spine, this will affect the angle of the spine, as well as the angle of the ribs and pelvis, and may cause the animal to walk with a slight waddle. This is not desirable in a <b>beef</b> <b>cow.</b> This can also cause problems with the legs, which means that the hooves do not wear evenly on the ground.
