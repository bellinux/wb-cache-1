He did not mark the yells of his tribesmen, nor feel the spears that rained down on himself, nor see the hideous face of the chief medicine-man peering at his own. Verva ceased to breathe. There was a convulsion, and her limbs were still. Then Why-Why rose. In his right hand was his famous club, [...] "the watcher of the fords;" [...] in his left his shield.

They continued on their way, and, within a few hours, brought back the dead body to Prossedi. Their suspicions of me being already awakened, I was arrested and thrown into prison.

This fellow had a trick of reminding him, he supposed, too unpleasantly of that young abbe done to death in the garden behind the Breton arme at Gavrillac. Not that the death of Philippe de Vilmorin lay heavily upon M. de La Tour d'Azyr's conscience. He had accounted himself fully justified of his action.

In the years 1950 and 1952, his tomb was opened and his body still had {{the appearance of a}} living one. The official site mentions: In this century his grave has been opened four times, the last time being in 1955, and each time [...] "it has been noticed that his <b>bleeding</b> <b>body</b> still has its flexibility as if it were alive"; no mentioning of later openings. The Catholic Tradition website says: Father Joseph Mahfouz, the postulator of the cause, certified that in 1965 the body of Saint Charbel was still preserved intact with no alteration. In 1976 he again witnessed the opening of the grave; this time the body was completely decomposed. Only the skeleton remained.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 73 - 82). This paper {{explores the}} silenced narratives around menstruation amongst female collegiate athletes. Techniques utilized include a literature review, an in-depth survey and focus group interviews of competitive female athletes at a southern California university, and {{detailed analysis of}} the research results. The literature review, through the historical examination of women's sports and menstrual policies and attitudes in the United States, displays the untold history of the menstruating female athlete. Detailing the precarious balance between the exclusive ideals of appropriate femininity, the literature review demonstrates the paradox of femininity in an athletically active and <b>bleeding</b> <b>body.</b> While research on female athletes has increased, inquest into current female athletes' experiences, feelings, and communication about menstruation remains a taboo subject. Modern day research uses a scientific and quantitative lens and focuses solely on the female athlete triad, which incorporates the loss of menstruation (amenorrhea) ignoring the lived experiences of active menstruating athletes. This thesis analyzes the interweaving themes of physical negotiation, communication, and emotions about and around menstruation. The results from the surveys and focus groups demonstrate the necessity for further research on the lived experiences of menstruating athletes. Constantly, female athletes are in a physical negotiation with their <b>bleeding</b> <b>body.</b> Made for a non-menstruating body, uniforms are the first negation of the female athlete. The tightness of the uniforms makes bloating even more uncomfortable, a visible tampon string or the outline of a pad undermines the " invisible protection" touted by these products, and lastly, the whiteness of the uniform speaks to a virginal fragility ruined by a menstrual leak. Another theme present is the silenced voice around menstruation. Afraid to talk to a coach for fear of decreased playing time, female athletes speak to trusted teammates and often ignore serious menstrual issues or potentially positive language around menstruation. Lastly, and most understudied, are the various attitudes towards menstruation by competitive female athletes. The answers provided by the respondents of the survey and focus group participants collectively distinguish this paper from previous studies. Results from this research indicate the necessity of further research on this subject to provide athletes with safe places for them to think, feel, and talk about their menstrual experiences...|$|R

40|$|Immediately after ovulation, in the {{follicular}} cavity, by multiplying and metaplasia of granulosa {{and internal}} sheath cells, a transient endocrine gland is formed, {{known as the}} corpus luteum (corpus luteum). Although in adult mice, ovulation occurs every 4 - 5 days throughout the year and important individual variations were noticed in terms of the normal estrous cycle, formation, progression and regression of corpus luteum are somewhat synchronized. This paper proposes a cytohistological study of the ovary of adult mice to capture the main morphological changes which occur {{in the process of}} organization, evolution and involution of the corpus luteum in this species. The investigations were performed on adult mouse ovaries of NMRI line, in various stages of the estrous cycle. They were fixed in 10 % formalin, then were sectioned 5 μ in size and were stained with Mallory trichrome method. Luteal morphology emphasizes that, after the loss of oocyte, follicular cavity shrinks due to the wrinkling of sheaths, then is filled with blood and lymph resulting initially the <b>bleeding</b> <b>body</b> (corpus hemorrhagicum). Cell differentiation takes thus place on a blood-cytolitic support, which is reabsorbed, and in the parenchyma of corpus luteum two types of luteal cells can be identified (large and small) ...|$|R

Almost immediately, he gets a reaction from a veritable Greek chorus of fellow social media users that quickly turns his inquiry into a witch-hunt against Shirono.

5000|$|The {{crowning}} {{merit of}} Javakhishvili's work - the novel Arsena of Marabda (არსენა მარაბდელი) - was composed between 1933 and 1936. The writer spent years {{on research and}} rewriting a Russian {{as well as a}} Georgian version of the novel. The plot is based on the life of a real historical figure, the brigand Arsena Odzelashvili, who is also a favorite hero of Georgian folklore. Javakhishvili focuses on the tragic necessity that makes the chivalrous peasant Arsena to degenerate into the typical 19th-century bandit. Although the story of an outlaw fighting against the gentry was considered [...] "ideologically correct", the [...] "left" [...] critics were suspicious of Javakhishvili's recognizable parallels between Imperial Russia and the Soviet state. Javakhishvili put many of his thoughts into Arsena's mouth. One example is his famous phrase: [...] "Russia is galloping after Europe and the <b>bleeding</b> <b>body</b> it is dragging after it on a rope is Georgia". The work won great popularity from the common reader and bitter attacks from the Communist critics and proletarian writers who accused him of corruption, misrepresentation, slander, and subversion; even the fact that his nephew worked as a tram conductor in Greece was used against him.|$|R
