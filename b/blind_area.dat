With the model, it is guaranteed that target areas can remain in the public vision field of the double cameras all the time during the double cameras platform moving. This feature is very important for the moving double cameras system, since 3 D reconstruction needs the double cameras to have an overlapping field of vision. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, some experiments on the model were conducted.

40|$|With the {{exception}} of primates, most vertebrates have laterally placed eyes. Binocular vision in vertebrates has been implicated in several functions, including depth perception, contrast discrimination, etc. However, the <b>blind</b> <b>area</b> {{in front of the}} head that is proximal to the binocular visual field is often neglected. This anterior <b>blind</b> <b>area</b> is important when discussing the evolution of binocular vision because its relative length is inversely correlated with the width of the binocular field. Therefore, species with wider binocular fields also have shorter anterior blind areas and objects along the mid-sagittal plane can be imaged at closer distances. Additionally, the anterior <b>blind</b> <b>area</b> is of functional significance for birds because the beak falls within this <b>blind</b> <b>area.</b> We tested for the first time some specific predictions about the functional role of the anterior <b>blind</b> <b>area</b> in birds controlling for phylogenetic effects. We used published data on visual field configuration in 40 species of birds and measured beak and skull parameters from museum specimens. We found that birds with proportionally longer beaks have longer anterior blind areas and thus narrower binocular fields. This result suggests that the anterior <b>blind</b> <b>area</b> and beak visibility do play a role in shaping binocular fields, and that binocular field width is not solely determined by the need for stereoscopic vision. In visually guided foragers, the ability to see the beak-and how much of the beak can be seen-varies predictably with foraging habits. For example, fish- and insect-eating specialists can see more of their own beak than birds eating immobile food can. But in non-visually guided foragers, there is no consistent relationship between the beak and anterior <b>blind</b> <b>area.</b> We discuss different strategies-wide binocular fields, large eye movements, and long beaks-that minimize the potential negative effects of the anterior <b>blind</b> <b>area.</b> Overall, we argue that there is more to avian binocularity than meets the eye...|$|E

30|$|The main {{disadvantage}} {{of our system}} is a <b>blind</b> <b>area</b> {{in the field of}} view, which does not exist in conventional systems. The <b>blind</b> <b>area</b> is an overlapping area of the unobservable areas of both cameras. This is illustrated as an acute triangle beside the two cameras in Figures 1 and 3, and its geometry is determined by the length of the camera unit and the parameters of image combination. Although discontinuous image is acquired when an object passes this area, it can provide a visual sign to the operator when the object is close to the camera unit. In addition, an object larger than a sphere with a diameter of the length of the camera unit can be observed even if part of it is hidden in the <b>blind</b> <b>area.</b> Since the length of the camera unit limits the size of the <b>blind</b> <b>area.</b> Of course, small objects hidden completely inside the <b>blind</b> <b>area</b> cannot be observed in the image, but this property can be used to hide small attachments to support the vision system without interfering with the acquired image.

In addition, a special phenomenon, namely Information <b>Blind</b> <b>Areas</b> where the network is separated by several information-unreachable clusters, will emerge from the spreading process. Furthermore, we also find that the size distribution of such information <b>blind</b> <b>areas</b> obeys power-law-like distribution, which has very similar exponent with that of site percolation.

40|$|The {{problem of}} lorries turning right : an {{analysis}} based on crashes in 2003 {{and the new}} European guidelines beginning in 2007. In spite of the mandatory introduction of <b>blind</b> <b>area</b> mirrors and <b>blind</b> <b>area</b> cameras per 1 January 2003, there are relatively many casualties in crashes involving lorries turning right. Requested by the Ministry of Transport, SWOV has analyzed the crashes of this type {{that took place in}} 2003. Results of a crash analysis of the 1998 - 2000 period were used as the before measurement. Summonses were used in both analyses. It is strongly suspected from numbers of casualties in 2004 and 2005 that the mandatory introduction of <b>blind</b> <b>area</b> facilities in 2003 have only had a temporary effect. The fact that in the Netherlands in 2002 and 2003 there was a large {{reduction in the number of}} deaths among cyclists from crashes in which a lorry turned right, can be attributed to the large scale publicity given and attention paid to the <b>blind</b> <b>area</b> problem. This led to lorry drivers and cyclists being more alert. The most important results of the crash analyses are: - The general pattern of crashes is that a lorry turning right does not give right of way to a cyclist continuing straight ahead; the cyclist takes right of way, whether conscious of there being a lorry present or not; - It mainly concerns lorries turning right after having stopped (e. g. for traffic lights); - The most common point of contact in a lorry-bicycle crash is on the front corner on the right-hand side of the lorry. The visibility of this most common point of contact is not included in the current EU requirements for the field of vision, nor in the requirements in the Netherlands per 1 January 2003. New EU requirements as of 1 January 2007 will indeed lead to a wider field of vision, but this is no guarantee that this field of vision can be used properly when turning right. That is why SWOV supports the conducting of a demonstration project that the Ministry of Transport has announced in its letter to parliament. This project involves a large scale testing in practice of the obligatory front mirrors and cameras. SWOV also advocates registering all data and findings objectively during this project, in the situation before as well as afterwards. Such a study provides knowledge about the mirror configuration (whether of not in combination with cameras) for new lorries after January 2007 as well as for existing ones. Besides these recommendations that refer to the field of vision, other measures can also reduce the danger of lorries turning right, such as: - preventing lorries and cyclists entering the junction area simultaneously by installing a separate green light; - installing traffic mirrors at junctions; - electronic detection of cyclists; - information for vulnerable road users; - larger front and side windscreens for lorries; - forbidding heavy traffic in city centres...|$|E
