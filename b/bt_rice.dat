50|$|Agricultural Biotechnology {{regulation}} {{falls under}} three main government agencies: The Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The USDA must approve {{the release of}} any new GMOs, EPA controls the regulation of insecticide, and the FDA evaluates {{the safety of a}} particular crop sent to market. On average, it takes nearly 13 years and $130 million of research and development for a genetically modified organism to come to market. The regulation process takes up to 8 years in the United States. The safety of GMOs has become a topic of debate worldwide, but scientific articles are being conducted to test the safety of consuming GMOs in addition to the FDA’s work. In one such article, it was concluded that <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> did not adversely affect digestion and did not induce horizontal gene transfer.|$|E

There has still been no commercial release of these lines yet due to public concerns about {{human health and}} environmental risks. Some studies confirmed that <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> was as safe as conventional rice to non-target organisms when pesticides were not applied, however, pesticides are still required in <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> to control non-lepidopteran pests. In this study, we assessed the environmental effects of two <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> lines expressing either the cry 1 Ab/ 1 Ac or cry 2 A genes, respectively, by using zooplanktons as indicator species under normal field management practices using pesticides when required. In the whole rice growing season, non-Bt rice was sprayed 5 times while <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> was sprayed 2 times, which ensured both rice achieved a normal yield. Field investigations showed that rice type (Bt and non-Bt) significantly influenced zooplankton abundance and diversity, which were up to 95 % and 80 % lower in non-Bt rice fields than <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> fields. Laboratory rearing showed that water from non-Bt rice fields was significantly less suitable for the survival and reproduction of Daphnia magna and Paramecium caudatum in comparison with water from <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> fields.

40|$|The {{advent of}} genetically {{modified}} (GM) <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> creates the possibility of interactions among Bt crops, crop pathogens and non-target herbivores. In particular, information on how pathogen-infected Bt-expressing plants will influence non-target herbivores is necessary to predict the sustainability of GM cropping systems. Laboratory bioassays were conducted to evaluate the potential combined impacts of rice dwarf virus (RDV) and two <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> lines, T 1 C- 19 (Cry 1 C) and T 2 A- 1 (Cry 2 A), on non-target green rice leafhopper (GRLH), Nephotettix cincticeps (Uhler) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae). In the first experiment, GRLHs feeding preference tests on <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> lines compared to a parental control rice line, MH 63, were conducted. As rice plants were uninfected with RDV, GRLHs generally preferred the control MH 63 line over the two Bt lines during the initial 8 h, with no significant preference during the following 64 h. As rice plants were infected with RDV, there were no clear preferences between the <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> lines and the control MH 63 line. In the second experiment, we assessed the combined influence of RDV-infection status and <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> lines on GRLH biological parameters.

40|$|Limitations of <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> in the entomological rice {{cropping}} {{context in}} sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. A review. In sub-Saharan African countries and Madagascar, rice crops host many insect species, {{which have been}} inventoried and studied for almost 40 years. Management of these rice pests using synthetic chemical pesticides is not common practice. In Asia, genetically modified rice varieties (<b>Bt</b> <b>rice)</b> resistant to some insects were engineered in the 1990 s. In 2009, two <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> varieties were authorized to be marketed in China. <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> is not grown in African countries. We therefore decided to analyze the published literature on <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> and to compare the findings with the current insect pest situation in African rice fields. The activity spectrum and the efficacy of Bt toxins represent the first limitation encountered {{in the use of}} currently available <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> varieties. For instance, the effect of Bt toxins against Diptera (Diopsidae) species is unknown, since these species only occur in Africa. On the African continent and in Madagascar, it would be essential to enhance or promote taxonomic, biological and ecological knowledge concerning rice pests and to more accurately measure the impact of various insect species on crop yields. The broad range of rice insect pests, including insect vectors of disease, the risk of target insects developing resistance to Bt toxins and the lack of economic assessments suggest that, with the current state of knowledge in Africa, it would be inappropriate to introduce currently available <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> varieties there...|$|E

Laboratory results showed relatively longer larval, pupal development and preoviposition durations of S. biformis. Although {{it had a}} shorter oviposition period, female adult longevity and less total laid eggs were found when fed on some tested <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> in comparison to non-Bt controls. S. biformis population dynamics in Bt and non-Bt plots were monitored using the plastic bag and beat plate methods. In the field, the temporal patterns of S. biformis population changes were similar between tested <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> lines and their respective control; however, {{the total number of}} S. biformis individuals collected from the Bt plots were significantly less or the same, varying from variety to variety, compared with those from the non-Bt plots.

40|$|Choline Chloride 60 % (CC) is a feed {{additive}} that is imported in significant quantities from China. In {{a number of}} cases GM rice, harbouring the event Bt 63, has been found in imported CC batches but not in derived pre-mixes. The Member States were asked to provide positive CC samples and derived pre-mixes to the EU-RL GMFF in order to allow the EU-RL GMFF establishing practical approaches to DNA extraction and the subsequent testing for presence of (a) rice and (b) the <b>Bt</b> 63 <b>rice</b> event. This technical note has been derived based on data provided from National Control Laboratories and experience made by the EU-RL GMFF when re-testing nine {{feed additive}} samples and ten pre-mixes samples. The EU-RL GMFF found that the extraction of DNA from the feed additive Choline Chloride (CC) does not normally pose specific problems. It can be carried out following the available protocols or using available standard DNA extraction kits. The extraction of DNA from derived pre-mixes (PMCC) is, however, posing problems because of observed strong inhibition and the presence of DNA from additional sources than those present in the CC. The EU-RL GMFF has tried a number of protocols and extraction kits on PMCC samples. On this basis it is concluded that it is advisable to carefully purify the DNA, to verify the possible presence of inhibition effects and eventually to try to reduce any inhibition observed. Concerning testing the extracted DNA for <b>rice</b> and <b>Bt</b> 63 <b>rice</b> event presence, this does not pose a problem in case of the CC while for PMCC rice was not anymore detectable or was detected in trace amounts. In any case testing for Bt 63 presence was impossible. A possible explanation could be that much of the extracted DNA is from other plants than rice and hence the concentration of rice DNA is below the LOD of the rice-taxon specific method. In order to verify this, the EU-RL GMFF has analysed the available rice (taxon-) specific methods by means of bio-informatics and (partly) in the laboratory and concludes that they all should be suitable for specifically and reliably detecting rice from the Oryza sativa species. The re-testing by the EU-RL GMFF of CC and PMCC samples has confirmed the results of the initial tests. JRC. I. 3 -Molecular Biology and Genomic...|$|R

Time-course metabolic changes of wild and Bacillus thuringiensis (<b>Bt)</b> transgenic <b>rice</b> (Oryza sativa L.) plants after insecticide treatment were investigated by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A combined statistical strategy of 2 -way ANOVA and multivariate analyses (principal component analysis and hierarchal cluster analysis) was performed to find the stress-associated effects. The results reveal that {{a wide range of}} metabolites were dynamically varied in both varieties as a response to insecticide, in multiple metabolic pathways, such as biosynthesis and metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, fatty acids, TCA cycle, and the shikimate/phenylpropanoid pathway, and most of the changes were correlated with the exposure time and dependent on the variety. A set of stress defenses were activated, including phytohormone signaling pathway, antioxidant defense system, shilcimate-mediated secondary metabolism, and so on. In particular, insecticide led to much stronger regulations of signaling molecules (salicylate and the precursor of jasmonate) and antioxidants (alpha-tocopherol and dehydroascorbate/ascorbate) in Bt-transgenic variety at the early stage.

Results: The results of electronic nose analysis showed that the Radar map of <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> cultivars was analogous to the non- <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> cultivars at each growing stage. PCA analysis was able to partly discriminate between some of the Bt vs. non-Bt rice sensors, but could not to separate Bt cultivars from non-Bt cultivars.

In BT-type CMS rice, the mitochondrial gene orf 79 is associated with male sterility. A complete sequence of the Boro-type mitochondrial genome responsible for BT-type CMS has not been determined to date. Here, we used pyrosequencing to construct the Boro-type mitochondrial genome.

We previously observed longer nymphal developmental duration and lower fecundity in brown planthopper (BPH) fed on <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> line KMD 2, although Bt insecticidal protein Cry 1 Ab could rarely concentrate in this non-target rice pest. In the present study, we performed microarray analysis in an effort to detect Bt-independent variation, which might render <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> more defensive and/or less nutritious to BPH. We detected 3, 834 and 3, 273 differentially expressed probe-sets in response to BPH infestation in non-Bt parent Xiushui 11 and <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> KMD 2, respectively, only 439 of which showed significant differences in expression between rice lines. Our analysis revealed a shift from growth to defense responses in response to BPH infestation, which was also detected in many other studies of plants suffering biotic and abiotic stresses. Chlorophyll biosynthesis and basic metabolism pathways were inhibited in response to infestation. IAA and GA levels decreased {{as a result of the}} repression of biosynthesis-related genes or the induction of inactivation-related genes. In accordance with these observations, a number of IAA-, GA-, BR-signaling genes were downregulated in response to BPH. Thus, the growth of rice plants under BPH attack was reduced and defense related hormone signaling like JA, SA and ET were activated. In addition, growth-related hormone signaling pathways, such as GA, BR and auxin signaling pathways, as well as ABA, were also found to be involved in BPH-induced defense. On the other side, 51 probe-sets (represented 50 genes) that most likely contribute to the impact of <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> on BPH were identified, including three early nodulin genes, four lipid metabolic genes, 14 stress response genes, three TF genes and genes with other functions.

Laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the potential effects of Cry 1 C- or Cry 2 A-producing transgenic rice (T 1 C- 19, T 2 A- 1) pollen on B. mori fitness. In a short-term assay, B. mori larvae were fed mulberry leaves covered with different densities of pollen from <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> lines or their corresponding near isoline (control) for the first 3 d and then were fed mulberry leaves without pollen. No effect was detected on any life table parameter, even at 1800 pollen grains/cm(2) leaf, which {{is much higher than}} the mean natural density of rice pollen on leaves of mulberry trees near paddy fields. In a long-term assay, the larvae were fed Bt and control pollen in the same way but for their entire larval stage (approximately 27 d).

Both systems correctly recognized their respective targets in control samples of Bt 63, Kefeng 6 and KMD 1 insect-resistant and LLRice 62 and LLRice 601 herbicide resistant rice. Due to its high discriminating power and broad GMO coverage capacity, the SYBR®Green PCR approach was further tested in more detail. Melting curve, capillary and agarose-gel electrophoresis analyses indicated that the P- 35 S, T-nos and CryIAb/Ac targets in the GM rice events are similar to the corresponding targets present in many known genetically modified organisms (GMO). High Resolution Melting analysis showed that the CryIAb/Ac targets of the GM <b>rice</b> events <b>Bt</b> 63 and Kefeng 6 matched best the corresponding Bt 11 CryIAb sequence. Digital PCR analysis on genomic DNA from the GM <b>rice</b> <b>Bt</b> 63 and Kefeng 6 events indicated that both GMO contained multiple inserts.

Using ELISA, we evaluated the transfer of Cry 1 Ab toxin in a food chain of <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> (KMD 1 and KMD 2), the target insect, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, and its predator, Pirata subpiraticus. Cry 1 Ab was detected in C. medinalis and P. subpiraticus. However, the concentration of Cry 1 Ab detected from C. medinalis and P. subpiraticus did not increase as feeding or preying time increased. A binding study of Cry 1 Ab to the brush border membrane vesicle of C. medinalis and P. subpi-raticus indicated that P. subpiraticus does not have binding receptors in its midgut to Cry 1 Ab, while C. medinalis does. Survivorship and fecundity of P. subpiraticus preying on Bt rice-fed C. medinalis were not significantly different from those preying on non-Bt rice-fed C. medinalis. Developmental time of P. subpiraticus was significantly longer when it preyed on Bt rice-fed C. medinalis than on non-Bt rice-fed prey. However, a 3 -year field trial indicated that <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> did not significantly affect the density of P. subpiraticus...|$|E
40|$|Rice and maize are {{important}} cereal crops {{that serve as}} staple foods, feed, and industrial material in China. Multiple factors constrain the production of both crops, among which insect pests are an important one. Lepidopteran pests cause enormous yield losses for the crops annually. In order to control these pests, China plays {{an active role in}} development and application of genetic engineering (GE) to crops, and dozens of GE rice and GE maize lines expressing insecticidal proteins from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been developed. Many lines have entered environmental release, field testing, and preproduction testing, and laboratory and field experiments have shown that most of the <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> and Bt maize lines developed in China exhibited effective control of major target lepidopteran pests on rice (Chilo suppressalis, Scirpophaga incertulas, and Cnaphalocrocis medinalis) and maize (Ostrinia furnacalis), demonstrating bright prospects for application. However, none of these Bt lines has yet been commercially planted through this writing in 2016. Challenges and perspectives for development and application of <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> and maize in China are discussed.

40|$|In this study, {{assessment}} of the safety of transgenic rice T 1 C- 1 expressing Cry 1 C was carried out by: (1) studying horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in Sprague Dawley rats fed transgenic rice for 90 d; (2) examining the effect of Cry 1 C protein in vitro on digestibility and allergenicity; and (3) studying the changes of intestinal microbiota in rats fed with transgenic rice T 1 C- 1 in acute and subchronic toxicity tests. Sprague Dawley rats were fed a diet containing either 60 % GM Bacillus thuringiensis (<b>Bt)</b> <b>rice</b> T 1 C- 1 expressing Cry 1 C protein, the parental rice Minghui 63, or a basic diet for 90 d. The GM <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> T 1 C- 1 showed no evidence of HGT between rats and transgenic rice. Sequence searching of the Cry 1 C protein showed no homology with known allergens or toxins. Cry 1 C protein was rapidly degraded in vitro with simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. The expressed Cry 1 C protein did not induce high levels of specific IgG and IgE antibodies in rats. The intestinal microbiota of rats fed T 1 C- 1 was also analyzed in acute and subchronic toxicity tests by DGGE. Cluster analysis of DGGE profiles revealed significant individual differences in the rats' intestinal microbiota...|$|E
40|$|In 2003 and 2004, {{field studies}} were {{conducted}} at three sites in Zhejiang Province in China {{to assess the}} impacts of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Berliner rice expressing a fused gene of cry 1 Ab and cry 1 Ac on nontarget planthoppers and leafhoppers. Populations in Bt plots were sampled with yellow sticky card traps, Malaise traps, and a vacuum-suction machine, and compared with samples from non-Bt control (IR 72) plots. The results from yellow sticky card trap samplings indicated {{no significant differences between}} Bt and non-Bt plots in the species composition or densities of each species of planthopper and leafhopper. Three species of planthoppers, Sogatella furcifera (Horvath), Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), and Laodelphax striatellus (Fallén), were collected at all sites, and three species of leafhoppers, Nephotettix cincticeps (Uhler), Thaia subrufa (Motschulsky), and Recilia dorsalis (Motschulsky), were collected at Hangzhou. Another species of leafhopper, N. virescens (Distant), was collected at Anji and Jiande instead of T. subrufa. The results from the Malaise trap and vacuum-suction samples revealed no significant differences between Bt and non-Bt plots in species structure of planthoppers and leafhoppers or in population changes of the predominant planthopper species, S. furcifera, the predominant leafhopper species, N. cincticeps, or N. virescens throughout most sampling dates. Densities of planthoppers and leafhoppers were significantly affected by year and site but not by <b>Bt</b> <b>rice.</b> In general, our results suggest that the <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> line tested did not adversely affect nontarget planthopper and leafhopper populations and will not lead to higher populations or damage by planthoppers and leafhopper...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} risks {{of genetically modified}} (GM) plants to environmental and human health have become a public concern in recent years, due {{to the release of}} transgenic crop plants worldwide and their replacement of traditional crops (Nap et al. 2003). The introduction of GM plants into agricultural ecosystems raised a number of ques-tions, including the ecological impact on soil eco-systems. Soil-borne communities are dominated by microorganisms, which account for> 80 % of the total biomass in soil (Kowalchuk et al. 2003). They are involved in numerous important processes, including decomposition of organic matter, nutri-ent mineralization, regulation of plant pathogens and improvement of soil structure (Bruinsma et al. 2003). Changes in the structure or function of microbial communities {{have a major impact on}} soil ecosystems and biogeochemical processes. Microbial community structure and function in rhizosphere soil, which is directly influenced by root exudates of GM plants, are often proposed as an early and dynamic indicator of GM risk as-sessment on soil ecology, and used increasingly for sensitive responses (Nannipieri et al. 2003). Rice is the staple diet for nearly two billion peo-ple worldwide and the major food for over half of those living in Asia. The introduction of <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> will not only greatly increase rice production, but also reduce the use of insecticides. Many rice vari-eties have been transformed with genes encoding various Bt crystal proteins and have been shown to be resistant to one or more lepidopteran pests of rice.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the coming}} years, the {{frequency}} of unauthorised genetically modified organisms (GMOs) being present in the European food and feed chain will increase significantly. Therefore, we have developed a strategy to identify unauthorised GMOs containing a pCAMBIA family vector, frequently present in transgenic plants. This integrated approach is performed in two successive steps on <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> grains. First, the potential presence of unauthorised GMOs is assessed by the qPCR SYBR®Green technology targeting the terminator 35 S pCAMBIA element. Second, its presence is confirmed via the characterisation of the junction between the transgenic cassette and the rice genome. To this end, a DNA walking strategy is applied using a first reverse primer followed by two semi-nested PCR rounds using primers that are each time nested to the previous reverse primer. This approach allows to rapidly identify the transgene flanking region and can easily be implemented by the enforcement laboratories...|$|E
40|$|Endotoxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) {{produced}} in transgenic pest-resistant Bt crops {{are generally not}} toxic to predatory and parasitic arthropods. However, elimination of Bt-susceptible prey and hosts in Bt crops could reduce predator and parasitoid abundance and thereby disrupt biological control of other herbivorous pests. Here we report results of a field study evaluating the effects of Bt sprays on non-target terrestrial herbivore and natural enemy assemblages from three rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields on Luzon Island, Philippines. Because of restrictions on field-testing of transgenic rice, Bt sprays were used to remove foliage-feeding lepidopteran larvae that would be targeted by <b>Bt</b> <b>rice.</b> Data from a 546 -taxa Philippines-wide food web, matched abundance plots, species accumulation curves, time-series analysis, and ecostatistical tests for species richness and ranked abundance were used to compare different subsets of non-target herbivores, predators, and parasitoids in Bt sprayed and water-sprayed (control) plots.

40|$|Abstract: Genetically {{modified}} (GM) rice KMD 1, TT 51 - 1, and KF 6 {{are three}} of the most well known transgenic <b>Bt</b> <b>rice</b> lines in China. A rapid and sensitive molecular assay for risk assessment of GM rice is needed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), currently the most common method for detecting genetically modified organisms, requires temperature cycling and relatively complex procedures. Here we developed a visual and rapid loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to amplify three GM rice event-specific junction sequences. Target DNA was amplified and visualized by two indicators (SYBR green or hydroxy naphthol blue [HNB]) within 60 min at an isothermal temperature of 63 °C. Different kinds of plants were selected to ensure the specificity of detection and the results of the non-target samples were negative, indicating that the primer sets for the three GM rice varieties had good levels of specificity. The sensitivity of LAMP, with detection limits at low concentration levels (0. 01 %– 0. 005 % GM), was 10 - to 100 -fold greater than that of conventional PCR. Additionally, the LAMP assay coupled with an indicator (SYBR greenInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13 1442...|$|E
40|$|Biotechnologies {{potentially}} {{have significant}} benefits {{for developing countries}} but many countries lack complete regulatory processes to allow their release. In evaluating {{the potential benefits of}} genetically modified crops, one must be able to measure the true cost of regulations in addition to the other costs associated with bringing the crop to market. The objectives of this paper are to (1) identify the direct costs of the regulation of Bt eggplant, <b>Bt</b> <b>rice,</b> ringspot virus resistant (PRSV) papaya and virus resistant tomatoes in the Philippines, and (2) estimate the opportunity cost of time lost in the regulatory process. The study compares the cost of regulations as they differ by factors such as the existence of previous studies on the product or the intention for export or domestic use. It is hypothesized that the costs are greater for products that are intended for export or human consumption or are produced by the private sector. It is also hypothesized that these factors increase the time to complete the regulatory process, therefore increasing the opportunity cost of time.

40|$|In {{the present}} study the effect of {{processing}} on starch fractions (rapidly digestible starch (RDS), slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch) were measured, using controlled enzymic hydrolysis with pancreatin and amyloglucidase, in six rice varieties; namely, <b>BT</b> <b>rice,</b> Gauri rice, Sona masoori, parboiled rice, Salem parboiled rice, and steamed rice. The processes studied were pressure cooking, boiling, steaming and straining. Rapidly available glucose (RAG) was also measured to derive a Starch Digestion Index (SDI). Cooking of rice by different methods decreased the amylose content. The degree of gelatinization ranged from 56 to 95, with pressure cooking resulting in the maximum degree. The starch fractions varied depending on the cooking method. Significant inverse correlations were seen between RDS and SDS (r = 0. 40, P < 0. 05), and between amylose and SDI (r = 0. 60, P < 0. 01). RAG and RDS related positively (r = 0. 90, P < 0. 01). The SDI of rice varieties cooked by the boiling and straining method were significantly higher (P < 0. 05). The results emphasize that cooking methods influence the nutritionally important starch fractions in rice varieties...|$|E
