50|$|Belarus has an {{embassy in}} Kiev and an honorary {{consulate}} in Lviv. Ukraine has an embassy in Minsk {{and a general}} consulate in Brest. Both countries are full members of the <b>Baku</b> <b>Initiative</b> and Central European Initiative.|$|E
50|$|Some experts, e.g. Frank Umbach of Centre for European Security Strategies, have criticised the <b>Baku</b> <b>Initiative</b> {{and other}} {{policies}} towards the Caspian region for concentrating {{too much on}} the technical cooperation instead of seeking a more strategic long-term cooperation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Baku</b> <b>Initiative</b> is {{originating}} from the European Neighbourhood Policy launched in 2004. On 13 November 2004, the First Ministerial Conference on Energy Cooperation between the EU and the littoral {{states of the}} Black Sea, Caspian Sea and their neighbours was held in Baku. Conclusions of this conference {{became known as the}} <b>Baku</b> <b>Initiative.</b> At the same time, a Transport Ministeral conference was held, resulting in a formal announcement on 14 November, supporting the framework of the EU TRACECA programme. A second Ministerial Conference following up the Energy Initiative was held in Astana, Kazakhstan on 30 November 2006. A second Transport Ministerial Conference was held in Sofia, Bulgaria on 2-3 May 2006.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Baku</b> <b>Initiative</b> is an {{international}} initiative of the European Union. It is a policy dialogue on energy and transport cooperation between the European Union and the littoral states of the Black Sea, Caspian Sea and their neighbours, undertaken {{as part of the}} INOGATE energy and TRACECA transport programmes.|$|E
50|$|There {{are between}} 895,000 and 2,400,000 ethnic Ukrainians living in Kazakhstan. Both {{countries}} are full members of TRACECA, of the <b>Baku</b> <b>Initiative,</b> of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, Partnership for Peace {{and of the}} Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. They are only 468 km apart at their closest points.|$|E
50|$|Beyond {{the bounds}} of the European Union, EU energy policy has {{included}} negotiating and developing wider international agreements, such as the Energy Charter Treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, the post-Kyoto regime and a framework agreement on energy efficiency; extension of the EC energy regulatory framework or principles to neighbours (Energy Community, <b>Baku</b> <b>Initiative,</b> Euro-Med energy cooperation) and the emission trading scheme to global partners; the promotion of research {{and the use of}} renewable energy.|$|E
50|$|The Baku port {{was built}} in 1902 and has since been the largest and busiest port of the Caspian Sea. It has played an {{important}} role in the Caspian trade for over one hundred years and is the main marine gateway to Azerbaijan. The port operates non-stop and is an important transit point in Europe-Asia trade promoted within TRACECA - RESTORATION OF THE HISTORIC SILK ROUTE project incepted by the <b>Baku</b> <b>Initiative.</b>|$|E
50|$|The European Union {{follows the}} {{progress}} of the <b>Baku</b> <b>Initiative</b> through the European Commission (Directorate General for Transport & Energy; Directorate General for External Relations, and EuropeAid Cooperation Office). The INOGATE Technical Secretariat (which is located in Kiev, with a regional office in Tbilisi covering the Caucasus) co-ordinates the energy aspects on behalf of the Commission and the TRACECA Secretariat, (which is located in Baku with a regional office in Odessa) performs the same function for the transport aspects.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Baku</b> <b>Initiative</b> {{resulted}} from a policy dialogue on energy cooperation between the European Union and the INOGATE partner countries. The initiative was announced on 13 November 2004 at the Energy Ministerial Conference in Baku. A second Ministerial Conference was held in Astana on 30 November 2006 which confirmed the broader remit of the INOGATE programme to cover a range of energy issues in the Partner Countries and their cooperation in these issues with the EU.|$|E
50|$|According to the EU Transport Directorate, 'The <b>Baku</b> <b>Initiative</b> aims to give {{an impulse}} to Trans-European {{transport}} cooperation {{on the basis of}} the mutual interest for the progressive integration of their respective transport networks and markets in accordance with EU and international legal and regulatory frameworks. It provides a supportive framework for TRACECA to foster the reflection on the cooperation between the EU-Black Sea/Caspian littoral States and their Neighbours, and to ensure the consistency with the EU priorities in the context of its Neighbourhood Policy.|$|E
50|$|TRACECA was {{established}} in May 1993, upon the signing of Multilateral Agreement on International Transport {{for the development of}} transport initiatives (including the establishment and development of a road corridor) between the EU member states, the Caucasus and Central Asia countries. The programme supports the political and economic independence of the former Soviet Union republics through enhancing their access to European and global markets through road, rail and sea.The objectives of TRACECA were underlined by the <b>Baku</b> <b>Initiative</b> of 2004, followed by a further ministerial conference in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 2006.|$|E
50|$|One {{objective}} of the <b>Baku</b> <b>Initiative</b> is to enhance integration of the energy markets of participating countries with the EU energy market, so as to create transparent energy markets, capable of attracting investment and enhancing security of energy supply. (Other aspects of the Initiative were concerned with transport issues: see main article). The partner countries agreed objectives to harmonise legal and technical standards so as to create a functioning integrated energy market in accordance with EU and international legal and regulatory frameworks; to increase the safety and security of energy supplies by extending and modernising existing infrastructure, substituting outdated power generation infrastructures with environmentally friendly systems; {{the development of new}} infrastructures and implementation of modern monitoring systems; improvement of energy supply and demand management through the integration of efficient and sustainable energy systems; and promotion of the financing of commercially and environmentally viable energy projects of common interest. A 'road-map' towards achievement of these and allied objectives was adopted at the Astana Ministerial Conference.|$|E

40|$|Sometimes {{considered}} an asset, other times a liability, the Black Sea started recently {{to be regarded}} as a region. However, the Black Sea Region lacks a common vision, often due to the complicated and often inefficient nexus of regional cooperation initiatives. Following the logic of finding regional solutions for regional problems, this paper aims to assess existing institutional and regional initiatives, reflecting on the implications for the success of Black Sea regionalism in creating patterns of sustained and sustainable development and a high degree of actors' involvement. This paper concentrates on two complementary research questions: What is the regional order in the BSR and what does it imply for its future? What is the current contribution of the most significant cooperation initiatives and what are the consequences for regional institutionalism? For the purpose of this paper, I draw on best-practices from other two regions: the Northern Dimension and South- East Asia. Through a comparative perspective, I suggest an analysis of the most important initiatives: BSEC, CDC, Black Sea Synergy, Eastern Partnership, <b>Baku</b> <b>Initiative</b> and the BSF. This paper argues that a possible strategic solution for successful policy development lies in the creation of an integrated regional cooperation package, functioning on the principles of multi-speed and multi-dimensional cooperation in several policy fields, in a context in which the BSR seems to be caught between two paradigms: a European and a Russian-oriented one...|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, the {{consideration}} of the South Caucasus within the EU has considerably evolved. This region, defined as a "neighbor of Europe" in the past, {{is now seen as}} a "European neighbor". This proposal intends to highlight how the energy factor, i. e. the transportation of Caspian oil and gas to Europe, has reshaped the interactions and the borders between the EU and the South Caucasus. Until 2003, the relationship between the EU and the South Caucasus was one-sided: Brussels wanted to develop cooperation within this region. However, some European actors were aware that the implementation of the BTC oil pipeline would redefine the borders between Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey and challenging those between the South Caucasus and the EU. In the aftermath of the ENP, the EU became increasingly active in the South Caucasus, developing several regional initiatives between these two regions (the <b>Baku</b> <b>Initiative,</b> the Black Sea Synergy, the Eastern Partnership). They led to a redefinition of the borders between the EU and the South Caucasus. The establishment of biregional platforms is supposed to help reinforcing European energy security. The EU is now struggling to implement a Southern gas Corridor and some are strongly advocating for an energy solidarity platform between Eastern Europe and the South Caucasian states. Establishing transregional links, the main issue would not be anymore what is the energy frontier between the South Caucasus and the EU but rather what binds them at the energy level...|$|E
