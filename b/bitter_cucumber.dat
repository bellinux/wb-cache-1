40|$|The {{inheritance}} of sex expression in cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and other cucurbits is well documented; however, the genetics of female sex (gynoecism) expression in bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) {{has not been}} described. Inheri-tance of gynoecism in bitter gourd was studied in a 100 % gynoecious line (Gy 263 B). The F 2 and testcross segregation data revealed that gynoecism in Gy 263 B is {{under the control of}} a single, recessive gene. Following the gene nomenclature of cucurbits, it is proposed that the gene symbol, gy- 1, be assigned for the expression of gynoecism in bitter gourd. Bitter gourd, balsam pear, bitter melon, or <b>bitter</b> <b>cucumber</b> (Momordica charantia) is an important cucurbitaceous vegeta-ble. Fruits of bitter gourd are widely consumed as a vegetable and are well known for its antidiabetic and other medicinal properties (Robinson and Decker-Walters 1997). Bitter gour...|$|E
40|$|Cucurbitacins are bitter triterpenoid {{compounds}} that are toxic to most organisms and occur widely in wild and cultivated Cucurbitaceae. The only cucurbitacin identified in Cucumis sativus is cucurbitacin C. The <b>bitter</b> taste of <b>cucumber</b> has been correlated with {{resistance to the}} spider mite Tetranychus urticae, but a quantitative relationship has not been established. We determined the spider mite resistance and cucurbitacin C content in the dihaploid progeny derived from the F 1 generation of {{a cross between a}} <b>bitter,</b> spider-mite-resistant <b>cucumber</b> line and a bitter-free, spider-mite-susceptible line. The ratio of the number of bitter to bitter-free dihaploids conformed to the expected 1 : 1 ratio, based on a monogenic segregation pattern. Genetic analysis ascribed 69 % of the variance of the difference in spider mite survival rate to the bitterness locus. Within the group of bitter dihaploids, cucurbitacin C content was significantly correlated with spider mite resistance. Thus, a quantitative relationship between cucurbitacin C content and spider mite resistance could be establishe...|$|R

50|$|The {{cylindrical}} stipe of Agrocybe putaminum measures 5 - 8 cm long by 1 - 1.5 cm thick, and {{is thicker}} {{at both the}} apex and the club-shaped base. Initially stuffed with a cottony pith, the stipe eventually becomes hollow. It is {{the same color as}} the cap, and has a surface marked by thin raised ridges (particularly near the top); these ridges originate from mycelial cords. The flesh of the mushroom is white, up to 1.5 cm thick, and does not change color when cut or otherwise injured. Its odor is both farinaceous (like freshly ground flour) and fungal, while its taste is <b>bitter,</b> with a <b>cucumber</b> aftertaste. The mushrooms are not edible.Agrocybe putaminum produces a dark brown spore print. Spores are roughly elliptical, smooth, thick-walled with a germ pore, and measure 10-12 by 5-9 μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25-30 by 10-15 μm. The stipe is covered in caulocystidia, which gives it a velvety texture.|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Citrullus colocynthis (L.) Schrab (cucurbitaceae family) (Handal) is a fruit {{commonly}} known as bitter apple or <b>bitter</b> <b>cucumber.</b> Traditionally, Citrullus colocynthis {{has been used for}} the treatment of diabetes. In particular, the acute effect and rout of administration of ethanol extract of the seedless pulp in vivo remains untested. We investigated the effect of different routs of administration and their hypoglycemic and insulinotropic effects of ethanol/water (20 / 80 V/V) extract of the dried seedless pulp of Citrullus colocynthis (L.) Schrab on normal and alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Approach: Rats were divided into two groups, normal and diabetic rats. Non-diabetic rats were fasted for 18 h before the beginning of the experimental procedure. About 250 &# 956;L of normal saline (i. e., vehicle) was administered to control groups either i. p. (Group I) or orally (Group III) using modified feeding canula. As 250 &# 956;L pulp extract was administered i. p. (Group II) or orally (Group IV). Five min, after the administration of the extract or vehicle, an Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test (IPGTT) was conducted (1. 5 g glucose/kg) on groups I, II, III and IV, but not Groups V or VI. Alloxan-induced diabetic rats were fasted for 6 h before the beginning of the experimental procedure. They were divided into control (Group V) and treated groups (Group VI), each of 6 rats. As 250 &# 956;L of the extract (equivalent to 300 mg kg - 1) was administered orally to alloxan treated-group, while 250 &# 956;L of the vehicle was administrated orally to the animals of control group. Serum samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 h following the treatment and were used for glucose and insulin determination. Results: Oral, but not intraperitonial (i. p.) administration of ethanol extract (300 mg kg - 1) resulted in acute, significant (p> 0. 05) and time-dependent changes in rat serum glucose and insulin levels in both normal and alloxan-induced diabetic rats. In extract-treated alloxan-free rats, a maximum of 32. 9 % reduction in serum glucose levels was observed following Intraperitonial Glucose Tolerance Test (IPGTT) using glucose-oxidase assay. A maximum reciprocal increase of 59. 5 % in serum insulin levels following IPGTT was determined by ELISA. Further, in alloxan/ethanol extract-treated group, a maximum of 31 % reduction in serum glucose levels as well as 370. 2 % increase in serum insulin levels following IPGTT were observed. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that oral administration of the ethanol extract of the dried seedless pulp of Citrullus colocynthis had normo-hypoglycemic (i. e., in normal rats), antihyperglycemic as well as insulinotropic actions in alloxan-induced diabetic rats...|$|E
60|$|Bitter {{things in}} nature at large, on the contrary, are almost {{invariably}} poisonous. Strychnia, for example, is intensely bitter, {{and it is}} well known that life cannot be supported on strychnia alone for more than a few hours. Again, colocynth and aloes are far from being wholesome food stuffs, for a continuance; and the <b>bitter</b> end of <b>cucumber</b> does not conduce to the highest standard of good living. The bitter matter in decaying apples is highly injurious when swallowed, which it isn't likely to be by anybody who ever tastes it. Wormwood and walnut-shells contain other bitter and poisonous principles; absinthe, which is made from one of them, is a favourite slow poison with the fashionable young men of Paris, who wish to escape prematurely from 'Le monde où l'on s'ennuie.' But prussic acid is the commonest component in all natural bitters, being found in bitter almonds, apple pips, the kernels of mangosteens, and many other seeds and fruits. Indeed, one may say roughly that the object of nature generally is to prevent the actual seeds of edible fruits from being eaten and digested; and for this purpose, while she stores the pulp with sweet juices, she encloses the seed itself in hard stony coverings, and makes it nasty with bitter essences. Eat an orange-pip, and you will promptly observe how effectual is this arrangement. As a rule, the outer rind of nuts is bitter, and the inner kernel of edible fruits. The tongue thus warns us immediately against bitter things, as being poisonous, and prevents us automatically from swallowing them.|$|R
60|$|The {{sense of}} taste, {{which in the}} lowest animals is {{diffused}} equally over the whole frame, is in ourselves and other higher creatures concentrated in a special part of the body, namely the mouth, where the food about to be swallowed is chewed and otherwise prepared beforehand {{for the work of}} digestion. Now it is, of course, quite clear that some sort of supervision must be exercised by the body over the kind of food {{that is going to be}} put into it. Common experience teaches us that prussic acid and pure opium are undesirable food-stuffs in large quantities; that raw spirits, petroleum, and red lead should be sparingly partaken of by the judicious feeder; and that even green fruit, the <b>bitter</b> end of <b>cucumber,</b> and the berries of deadly nightshade are unsatisfactory articles of diet when continuously persisted in. If, at the very outset of our digestive apparatus, we hadn't a sort of automatic premonitory adviser upon the kinds of food we ought or ought not to indulge in, we should naturally commit considerable imprudences in the way of eating and drinking--even more than we do at present. Natural selection has therefore provided us with a fairly efficient guide in this respect in the sense of taste, which is placed at the very threshold, as it were, of our digestive mechanism. It is the duty of taste to warn us against uneatable things, and to recommend to our favourable attention eatable and wholesome ones; and, on the whole, in spite of small occasional remissness, it performs this duty with creditable success.|$|R
