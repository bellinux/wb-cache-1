The genus has a sack-like body with faint radiating lines originally interpreted as tentacles, but {{discovery of a}} frond-like structure seemingly attached to some Heimalora has added weight to a competing interpretation: that it represents the holdfast of a larger organism. [...] This interpretation would stand against its original classification in the medusoid Cnidaria; it would also consign a once-popular hypothesis placing Hiemalora in the chondrophores, {{on the basis of}} its tentacle structure, to the dustbin.

Mud-gas monitoring indicated that δC 13 of methane below 600 mbsf shows very light values, - 60 to - 80 ‰, suggesting continuous biogenic methane production up to temperatures reaching 60 °C. Initial data for microbial cell abundance show extremely low counts below 1500 mbsf but higher counts are detected within coal beds [20]. This indicates that 2000 mbsf {{is close to the}} limit of the biosphere in normal clastic sediments, but the rather rich biosphere survived within coal beds.

These beds {{are part of an}} Upper Triassic to Lower Jurassic carbonate succession, which crops out {{in the eastern part of}} the Gran Sasso range. This succession includes euxinic deposits (bituminous dolostone) and other pelagic sediments (mudstone and calcarenites) which developed in a basin rimmed by a carbonate platform. In the same time interval, the well-known formations of Dolomia Principale and Calcare Massiccio were forming on this platform. In this paper we examine the radiolarian assemblages collected in three levels of the ammonite <b>bearing</b> <b>beds,</b> and we define two new genera (Squinabolia and Turritus) and eight new radiolarian species (Anaticapitula parvireticulata, Anaticapitula triangularis, Farcus aquilensis, Farcus leonseveroi, Parahsuum vraddense, Squinabolia multispinata, Turritus venturii, Zhamoidellum sphaericus), and we define twenty four other species, for a total of thirty eight identified species. The ammonites in the lowest level indicate a middle Hettangian age, those from the two upper levels a late Hettangian.

40|$|Here is {{presented}} a high resolution vegetation model and ecological analysis of an extinct floodplain ecosystem {{based on the}} palynology of deposits of the Sagwon Bluffs, northeast Alaska.   This fluvio – lacustrine succession of coal – <b>bearing</b> <b>beds</b> is of Late Palaeocene age and dominated by fine-grained sediment interspersed by coarse sandstones and conglomerates.   Deposition occurred at a latitude of ~ 85 ° N, but owing to the Palaeocene greenhouse climate, mean annual temperatures as high as 6 - 7 °C allowed temperate plant ecosystems to exist.   The palynological dataset has been analysed here using ‘Correspondence Analysis’ (CA) and ‘Fuzzy c -Means Cluster analysis’ (FCM), allowing assessment of proposed ecological groups.   Geochemical analysis has been incorporated using ‘Canonical Correspondence Analysis’ (CCA), demonstrating affiliations of certain taxa to chemical signatures of associated sediments.   These techniques collectively reveal a gymnosperm – dominated floodplain forest with a substantial angiosperm, fern and bryophyte component analogous to modern wooded bogs and riparian swamp forests.   Principal taxa of late seral development include Metasequoia, Taxodium, Sequoia and Nyssa, representing the dominant component of such a forest.   Mid seral floras were characterised by coniferous gymnosperm and broad-leaved angiosperm co-dominance, incorporating Corylus, Alnus, Castanea, Ginkgo and a diversity of Pteridaceous, Polypodiaceous, Osmundaceous and Schizaceaen ferns.   Variably high abundances of Sphagnum- type bryophyte spores suggest extensive peat-forming mires.   The inconsistencies of the ecological structure displayed in the palynological assemblage suggest a dynamic floodplain, however, affected by a changing hydrological and climatic regime.   Climate cooling is considered to have affected the floras concurrent with an increasingly wet floodplain prior to a hypothesised period of mountain building to the south.

This study was therefore predicated on these problems to assess the underground water and pollution vulnerability of the study area. The method of study involves literature survey of previous work done in Imo River sedimentary basin and other works considered necessary for the study. A total of ten (10) vertical electricity soundings (VES) was conducted for data generation using terrameter 300 SAS employing Schlumberger configuration. Aquifer (sands) from boreholes within three (3) communities and ten (10) water samples were collected and used for statistical and geochemical analysis. The result shows that the lithology is made of sand, silt sand, clay and shale. Three (3) aquifer systems exits in the area confined, semi confined and unconfined aquifers, these occur as upper (33. 5 m), middle (82 m) and lower (102 to 115 m) aquifers. The lithology comprises 4 to 6 layers with water <b>bearing</b> <b>bed</b> occurring at the fifth layer. Average aquifer thickness measured 38 metres. Multiaquifer system exists in some localities. Hydraulic conductivity values range from 25. 6 m/day to 28. 9 m/day, transmissivity ranges from 450. 842 /day to 111. 7 m 2 /day while the storativity values ranges from 0. 468 x 10 - 5 to 1. 13 x 10 - 5, all indicate aquifer of good yield.

40|$|AbstractThe {{internal}} {{orientation of}} fossil mass occurrences can be exploited as useful {{source of information}} about their primary depositional conditions. A series of studies, using different kinds of fossils, especially those with elongated shape (e. g., elongated gastropods), deal with their orientation and the subsequent reconstruction of the depositional conditions (e. g., paleocurrents and transport mechanisms). However, disk-shaped fossils like planispiral cephalopods or gastropods were used, up to now, with caution for interpreting paleocurrents. Moreover, most studies just deal with the topmost surface of such mass occurrences, due to the easier accessibility. Within this study, a new method for three-dimensional reconstruction of the internal structure of a fossil mass occurrence and the subsequent calculation of its spatial shell orientation is established. A 234 million-years-old (Carnian, Triassic) monospecific mass occurrence of the ammonoid Kasimlarceltites krystyni from the Taurus Mountains in Turkey, embedded in limestone, is used for this pilot study. Therefore, a 150 × 45 × 140 mm 3 block of the ammonoid <b>bearing</b> limestone <b>bed</b> has been grinded to 70 slices, with a distance of 2 mm between each slice. By using a semi-automatic region growing algorithm of the 3 D-visualization software Amira, ammonoids of a part of this mass occurrence were segmented and a 3 D-model reconstructed. Landmarks, trigonometric and vector-based calculations were used to compute the diameters and the spatial orientation of each ammonoid. The spatial shell orientation was characterized by dip and dip-direction and aperture direction of the longitudinal axis, as well as by dip and azimuth of an imaginary sagittal-plane through each ammonoid. The exact spatial shell orientation was determined for a sample of 675 ammonoids, and their statistical orientation analyzed (i. e., NW/SE).

40|$|The {{object of}} this project {{is to develop a}} new {{methodology}} to improve bearing condition monitoring and diagnosis, based on embedded sensing approach. The presented study involves work in four areas. ^ First is investigation of the embedded sensing approach. Studies of the bearing structure dynamics and defect-related vibrations reveal the important characteristics of defect signals. The sensor placement strategy of embedded sensing is verified through theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experiment test. The embedded sensing enables the acquisition of bearing signals with a high signal-to-noise ratio, which is critical to the reliable defect detection. ^ Second is the feasibility investigation of the embedded sensing approach through a wireless sensing module design. The miniaturized sensing module, configured as an accelerometer or dynamic load sensor, have an on-board signal conditioner and a wireless transmitter. It has been designed, prototyped, bench-scale tested, and structurally integrated into a customized <b>bearing</b> test <b>bed</b> for on-line <b>bearing</b> monitoring. A combination of surface mount (SMT) and thick-film hybrid technologies has been used {{to reduce the size of}} the sensing module. ^ Third is the defect signal extraction for the embedded sensing approach. A new signal processing technique has been developed in order to improve the effectiveness of the defect feature extraction. It combines the wavelet analysis on the time-scale domain and the analysis on the frequency domain. Experimental studies have shown that it is more effective in detecting the existence of a small bearing defect of 0. 25 mm in diameter, as compared to the frequency-domain analysis or the wavelet analysis alone. ^ Fourth is the defect evaluation. To enable automated bearing defect evaluation, a bearing health index is introduced from the quantization of defect severity. Under different bearing operation conditions (e. g. speed, radial and axial loads), bearing defects are evaluated through a backpropagation neural network. Its input features are constructed based on the defect signatures, which are extracted by the combined wavelet and frequency-domain analysis. ^ In addition to on-line bearing condition monitoring, the techniques developed for the embedded sensing can be also adapted to the condition monitoring of many other types of manufacturing equipment. ...|$|R

One {{of the ways to}} increase the bearing capacity of {{piled foundations}} is the necessity to take into account resistance of foundation bed soil located under raft bottom. The raft as well as a shallow foundation is capable to transfer a significant part of building load into the soil. Such approach makes it possible to reduce a number of piles in the foundation or shorten their length. Then it results in shortening of the construction period and significant reduction in zero cycle. However up to the present moment reliable calculation methods that permit to take into account soil resistance in the raft base. An analysis of previous investigations on the matter executed by various researchers and a number of field investigations have been carried out with the purpose to develop the proposed methods. The paper presents results of field investigations on foundations consisting of short stamped tapered piles which are joined together {{with the help of the}} raft fragment. Strength and deformation characteristics of the bases are increasing while making such foundations in the fill-up soil. In this case the filled-up ground layer becomes a bearing layer both for piles and rafts as well. Improvement of high-plastic clay-bearing soil properties is ensured by ramming dry concrete mix under pile foot. The paper describes an experience on application of the piled-raft foundation in complicated engineering and geological conditions while constructing the Orthodox Church in Minsk. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{research}} the vibration characteristics of the bearing plate on roadheader test bed to bear the roadheaders with different parameters, this paper establishes a multi-body dynamic model for the bearing plate to bear the roadheaders by using the theory of multi-body dynamics, and analyzes and determines a mathematical model of loads between the track and the bearing plate. By modal analysis of multi-body dynamic model of the roadheader, this paper extracts the modal shape of the system, and draws a frequency response diagram for system vibration, and obtains a larger vibration frequency range. To further explore the vibration characteristics, this paper researches the damping of different hydraulic systems, different mass, stiffness parameters {{and the impact of}} the roadheader on the vibration of the bearing plate on the test bed by using the computer numerical simulation, and obtains the longitudinal vibration characteristics of three test points in the geometric center, namely, cutting head, cantilever and engine body. The research results show that the mass of the road-header on the test bed is increased by 6 %, and the longitudinal amplitudes of the cutting head and cantilever are respectively reduced by 37 % and 19 %; the damping of the hydraulic system of the roadheader is increased by 19 %, and the longitudinal amplitudes of the cutting head, cantilever and engine body are respectively reduced by 33 %, 23 % and 16 %; the stiffness of the engine body doubles, and the longitudinal amplitudes of the cutting head and cantilever are respectively reduced by 35. 8 % and 27 %. The results are consistent with the underground industrial test so as to provide a regularity basis for load analysis of the test <b>bed</b> <b>bearing</b> the roadheaders with different parameters...|$|R
