2500|$|Film critic Jonathan Romney {{writes that}} the film has been {{interpreted}} in many different ways; as being about the crisis in masculinity, sexism, corporate America, and racism: [...] "It's tempting to read The Shining as an Oedipal struggle not just between generations but between Jack's culture of the written word and Danny's culture of images...." [...] Romney writes, [...] "Jack also uses the written word to more mundane purpose – to sign his 'contract' with the Overlook. 'I gave my word,' [...] which we take to mean 'gave his soul' in the [...] Faustian sense. <b>But</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> means it more literally – by the end [...] he has renounced language entirely, pursuing Danny through the maze with an inarticulate animal roar. What he has entered into is a conventional business deal that places commercial obligation [...] over the unspoken contract of compassion and empathy {{that he seems to}} have neglected to sign with his family." [...] These varied interpretations spawned the 2012 documentary Room 237, directed by Rodney Ascher, which provides an in-depth exploration of various interpretations of, and myths surrounding, the film.|$|E

Besides, he always has the door-key in his pocket, when he doesn't forget it, which is pretty often. Perhaps he had your door-key in his pocket, but after all, even if he had, that wouldn't alter the fact that he's been out all night. <b>But</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> in bed--did you look?" ...|$|R

Well, we can't have everything, even in a man of God; <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> isn't really a man of God. That would account for a good many things.

50|$|Born in La Font de la Figuera, {{he is said}} to {{have studied}} his art for some time in Italy due to Sebastiano del Piombo's influence, with which school his affinities are closest, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> never went to Italy, and he {{received}} this influence by the Italian peintures arriving to Valencia. Furthermore, two Italian painters Paolo da San Leocadio and Francesco Pagano, were engaged by cardinal Rodrigo Borgia for painting in Valencia Cathedral. Otherwise, the greater part of his professional life was spent in the city of Valencia, where most of the extant examples of his work are now found. All relate to religious subjects, and are characterized by dignity of conception, accuracy of drawing, beauty of color, and minuteness of finish. He died at Bocairent (near Xàtiva) while working on an altarpiece in the church there.|$|E

5000|$|Since Wendt {{was cast}} as George (who evolved into Norm Peterson), Ratzenberger {{suggested}} to the producers that a know-it-all character should be added; {{this led to}} the creation of Cliff Clavin. Ratzenberger based his role on a police officer in his hometown of Bridgeport, Connecticut. Cliff was originally a security guard, but two days before the pilot's filming he was changed to a postman; the producers thought a postman would be more knowledgeable than a guard. Ratzenberger agreed to seven episodes of the first season, but his role expanded. Cliff is the kind of guy who wishes he'd been a combat Marine, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> was nearsighted or had flat feet and became a mailman. He loves the respect he gets. ...As for women, Cliff is like the construction workers who whistle at women but turn to a quivering mass when they're face-to-face with a woman.

5000|$|Zarkandar {{began the}} new season by {{returning}} to France for the Grade 1 Grand Prix d'Automne over 4800 metres at Auteuil on 1 November. Ridden by the French jockey Vincent Cheminaud he started the 16/5 second favourite behind Gemix, with the other runners including Reve de Sivola, winner of the race in 2013. He won the race by five lengths from Gemix, with Dulce Leo three lengths back in third. On his return to England, Zarkandar started odds-on favourite for the Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot. He tracked the pace-setting Reve de Sivola before taking the lead at the second last and going into a two length lead. On the run-in, however, he faltered when challenged by the resurgent Reve de Sivola and was beaten a head. After the race owner Chris Giles commented [...] "I don't blame the jockey, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> would do it differently {{if he did it}} again and wait a bit longer".|$|E
