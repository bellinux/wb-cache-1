5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are manufactured}} with domed (convex) and dished (concave) <b>bottoms.</b> The dished profile {{allows them to}} stand upright on a horizontal surface, and is the standard shape for industrial cylinders. The cylinders used for emergency gas supply on diving bells are often this shape, and commonly have a water capacity of about 50 litres ("J"). Domed <b>bottoms</b> give a larger volume for the same cylinder mass, and are the standard for scuba cylinders up to 18 litres water capacity, though some concave bottomed cylinders have been marketed for scuba.|$|E

50|$|The {{transport}} of Weddell Sea <b>Bottom</b> Water {{out of the}} Weddell Sea represents the outflow of newly formed <b>bottom</b> water plus entrained <b>bottom</b> water that enters the Weddell Sea from the southeast. Carmack and Foster estimated the production rate of <b>bottom</b> water from the mixing ratio of newly formed <b>bottom</b> water to entrained <b>bottom</b> water. <b>Bottom</b> water formation models based on hydrographic observations suggested that the <b>bottom</b> water formed {{at the edge of}} the continental shelf has an initial temperature of -1.4 to -1.2 °C. This range also represents the coldest <b>bottom</b> water observed at the base of the continental slope in the northwestern corner of the Weddell Sea. The fraction of newly formed <b>bottom</b> water in the outflowing WSBW ranges from about 12 to 31%, so the flow of newly formed <b>bottom</b> water out of the Weddell Sea is about 2 to 5 Sv. On the other hand, the much larger production rates sometimes proposed are probably estimates of the total {{transport of}} <b>bottom</b> water out of the Weddell Sea that include a large fraction of Antarctic <b>Bottom</b> Water entering the Weddell Sea from the southeast.|$|R

In terms of philosophy, Coleridge brings together ideas in George Berkeley's An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision and David Hartley's Observations on Man.|$|E
5|$|Dyspanopeus sayi lives {{predominantly}} on muddy <b>bottoms,</b> {{where it}} is a predator of bivalve molluscs. In its native environment, it hides among colonies of polychaetes to avoid being preyed on by the Atlantic blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. It is an important predator of the quahog, Mercenaria mercenaria, in Narragansett Bay, and of the barnacle Balanus improvisus in Delaware Bay. In the Adriatic Sea, {{it has been observed}} to feed on the striped venus clam, Chamelea gallina, and the introduced Asian date mussel, Musculista senhousia.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{resident}} {{rainbow trout}} usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, well oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel <b>bottoms.</b> They are {{native to the}} alluvial or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the Pacific basin, but introduced rainbow trout have established wild, self-sustaining populations in other river types such as bedrock and spring creeks. Lake resident rainbow trout are usually found in moderately deep, cool lakes with adequate shallows and vegetation to support production of sufficient food sources. Lake populations generally require access to gravelly bottomed streams to be self-sustaining.|$|E

5|$|In Missouri, at the Lisbon <b>Bottoms</b> {{section of}} the Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, wild pallid {{sturgeon}} larvae were collected in 1998. These nonhatchery-raised larvae were the first recovered on the lower Missouri River in the previous 50years. The recovery was made along a side channel of the Missouri River that had been developed to provide suitable habitat for pallid sturgeon and other fish spawning. The side channel was apparently {{being used by the}} larva pallid sturgeon for protection from the swifter currents of the Missouri River.|$|E

5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} {{lives on}} muddy and sandy <b>bottoms,</b> grazing on algae and detritus.

Predators of this snail include carnivorous gastropods such as cone snails and volutes. It is also a prey species for vertebrates including macaques, and also humans, who consume the soft parts {{in a wide variety}} of dishes.|$|E

Natives hunted game, gathered plants and fruits, and fished in local bodies of water around the Metacomet Ridge. Tracts of woodland in the river <b>bottoms</b> surrounding the ridges were sometimes burned to facilitate the cultivation of crops such as corn, squash, tobacco, and beans.|$|E
