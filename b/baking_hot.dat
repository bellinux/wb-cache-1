50|$|Eggs {{can also}} be used in baking to produce savoury or sweet dishes. In {{combination}} with dairy products especially cheese, they are often prepared as a dessert. For example, although a baked custard can be made using starch (in the form of flour, cornflour, arrowroot, or potato flour), the flavour of the dish is much more delicate if eggs are used as the thickening agent. Baked custards, such as crème caramel, are among the items that need protection from an oven's direct heat, and the bain-marie method serves this purpose. The cooking container is half submerged in water in another, larger one, so that the heat in the oven is more gently applied during the baking process. Baking a successful soufflé requires that the baking process be carefully controlled. The oven temperature must be absolutely even and the oven space not shared with another dish. These factors, along with the theatrical effect of an air-filled dessert, have given this baked food a reputation for being a culinary achievement. Similarly, a good baking technique (and a good oven) are also needed to create a baked Alaska because of the difficulty of <b>baking</b> <b>hot</b> meringue and cold ice cream at the same time.|$|E

Then he turned all his pockets inside out, and examined them as carefully as if diamonds lurked in the seams. No, not a speck of tobacco was to be found! He smelt them. The odour was undoubtedly strong--very strong. On the strength of it he shut his eyes, and endeavoured to think that he was smoking; but it was a weak substitute for the pipe, and not at all satisfying.

40|$|Solid-state lasers, and in {{particular}} fiber lasers, are becoming {{the most commonly used}} lasers in science and industry, next only to diode lasers. This work has targeted the development of two novel types of laser active and passive media, an active medium based on Cr:ZnSe ceramic glass fibers, and a graphene based silver saturable absorber mirror. These are the two most important constituent parts of a novel type of broadband femtosecond fiber laser operating in the very interesting wavelength range between 2. 2 and 2. 6 microns. The main challenge in developing a broadband glass fiber active medium {{lies in the fact that}} fiber lasers are usually doped with rare-earth ions. These ions preserve their preferred valency also in the amorphous structure of the fiber laser, but yield narrowband lasers operating only at specific wavelengths. To develop a broadband, tunable laser, transition-metal ions must be used. However, the aliovalent nature of these ions means that direct incorporation into a glass matrix leads to a range of valencies of the ions, inhibiting laser action. To overcome this problem, in this work a new methodological approach was applied to solving this problem incorporation of ZnSe crystal micro-particles doped with Cr 2 + into a phosphate glass matrix, retaining the valency of Cr 2 + in the fixed local ZnSe crystalline environment of the ion. To develop this new ceramic glass fiber, a number of technological steps have been undertaken. - A standard melting technique was employed to fabricate phosphate glasses with low melting temperatures, and for incorporation of Cr:ZnSe into the glass matrix. This yielded the first reported successful incorporation of Cr:ZnSe particles in phosphate glasses, where the glasses were shown to retain the spectroscopic and luminescent properties of Cr:ZnSe. - As the Cr:ZnSe micro-particles initially showed signs of dissociation at the high temperature, reducing the time of the Cr:ZnSe spent in the melted glass was identified to be a critical issue. To further characterise the developed material, a number of characterisation steps have been undertaken: - Absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy was performed. The fluorescence spectra showed spectra characteristic of Cr 2 + ions, and an emission cross-section of the order of 10 e- 18 cm^ 2 was obtained at 2000 nm. - A cut-back loss measurement technique showed that the losses in the glass were non-uniform across the samples, originating from the non-uniform distribution of Cr:ZnSe particles in the glass matrix. Large agglomerations of Cr:ZnSe particles led to large scattering losses, while regions of finely incorporated particles (< 1 micron) showed low losses. - The gain was calculated and compared with the losses. The average losses over the sample, of about 6 cm- 1 at 2000 nm, were slightly higher than the measured gain of about 4 cm- 1, showing loss reduction as the critical parameter to focus on in order to achieve an efficient gain material. Areas of finely incorporated particles showed losses below 1 cm- 1, showing that with homogeneous distribution of particles, the material will become even better as a laser material. - Differential scanning calorimetry measurements were performed to identify the glass transition temperature at about 300 C, and Raman spectroscopy of the glasses were used to identify the Cr:ZnSe Raman peaks in the phosphate glass matrix. The spectroscopic study shows the good prospects of this material as a laser material. For creation of ultra-short pulses in the broadband fiber laser, a passive laser element - a saturable absorber - should be developed and incorporated into the laser. Graphene saturable absorbers on silver mirrors were created, and used to successfully mode-lock a Cr:ZnS laser. In particular, the following technological and characterisation steps were undertaken: - The graphene mirrors were fabricated by transferring CVD grown graphene from a Cu foil onto the silver mirror substrate by a standard transfer process. The process showed to be highly dependent on the handling of the materials, making it prone to human error. Difficulties with the adhesion of graphene to the underlying substrate were due to variations in the heat treatment, where soft <b>baking</b> on a <b>hot</b> plate made the process dependent on thickness and thermal conductivity of the substrate. - The graphene saturable absorber on a silver mirror was used to successfully mode-lock a Cr:ZnS laser, yielding pulses of 100 fs with an input laser power of 3 W. The saturation energy fluence of the graphene saturable absorber mirror was calculated at 4. 8 uJ/cm 2, significantly lower than commonly reported values, but agreeing with the observed trend that the saturation energy fluence decreases with increasing wavelength. Summarising, the undertaken approach towards development of a novel ceramic glass fiber laser proved to be successful, and allowed to make two main conclusions: - The developed ceramic glass fiber, preserving the valency of the active ions, showed promising spectral-luminescent properties as a laser active medium. - The developed passive saturable absorber based on graphene mirrors demonstrated very good laser performance and could be used in the future ceramic glass fiber laser...|$|R
6000|$|From Albano you {{may take}} {{your way through}} several ancient little cities to Frascati, a rival centre of villeggiatura, the road {{following}} the hillside for a long morning's walk and passing through alternations of denser and clearer shade--the dark vaulted alleys of ilex and the brilliant corridors of fresh- sprouting oak. The Campagna is beneath you continually, with the sea beyond Ostia receiving the silver arrows of the sun upon its chased and burnished shield, and mighty Rome, to the north, lying at no great length in the idle immensity around it. The highway passes below Castel Gandolfo, which stands perched on an eminence behind a couple of gateways surmounted with the Papal tiara and twisted cordon; and I have more than once chosen the roundabout road {{for the sake of}} passing beneath these pompous insignia. Castel Gandolfo is indeed an ecclesiastical village and under the peculiar protection of the Popes, whose huge summer-palace rises in the midst of it like a rural Vatican. In speaking of the road to Frascati I necessarily revert to my first impressions, gathered {{on the occasion of the}} feast of the Annunziata, which falls on the 25th of March and is celebrated by a peasants' fair. As Murray strongly recommends you to visit this spectacle, at which you are promised a brilliant exhibition of all the costumes of modern Latium, I took an early train to Frascati and measured, in company with a prodigious stream of humble pedestrians, the half-hour's interval to Grotta Ferrata, where the fair is held. The road winds along the hillside, among the silver-sprinkled olives and through a charming wood where the ivy seemed tacked upon the oaks by women's fingers and the birds were singing to the late anemones. It was covered with a very jolly crowd of vulgar pleasure-takers, and the only creatures not in a state of manifest hilarity were the pitiful little overladen, overbeaten donkeys (who surely deserve a chapter to themselves in any description of these neighbourhoods) and the horrible beggars who were thrusting their sores and stumps at you from under every tree. Every one was shouting, singing, scrambling, making light of dust and distance and filling the air with that childlike jollity which the blessed Italian temperament never goes roundabout to conceal. There is no crowd surely at once so jovial and so gentle as an Italian crowd, and I doubt if in any other country the tightly packed third-class car in which I went out from Rome would have introduced me to so much smiling and so little swearing. Grotta Ferrata is a very dirty little village, with a number of raw new houses <b>baking</b> on the <b>hot</b> hillside and nothing to charm the fond gazer but its situation and its old fortified abbey. After pushing about among the shabby little booths and declining a number of fabulous bargains in tinware, shoes and pork, I was glad to retire to a comparatively uninvaded corner of the abbey and divert myself with the view. This grey ecclesiastical stronghold is a thoroughly scenic affair, hanging over the hillside on plunging foundations which bury themselves among the dense olives. It has massive round towers at the corners and a grass-grown moat, enclosing a church and a monastery. The fore-court, within the abbatial gateway, now serves as the public square of the village and in fair-time of course witnesses the best of the fun. The best of the fun was to be found in certain great vaults and cellars of the abbey, where wine was in free flow from gigantic hogsheads. At the exit of these trickling grottos shady trellises of bamboo and gathered twigs had been improvised, and under them a grand guzzling proceeded. All of which was so in the fine old style that I was roughly reminded of the wedding-feast of Gamacho. The banquet was far less substantial of course, but it had a note as of immemorial manners that couldn't fail to suggest romantic analogies to a pilgrim from the land of no cooks. There was a feast of reason close at hand, however, and I was careful to visit the famous frescoes of Domenichino in the adjoining church. It sounds rather brutal perhaps to say that, when I came back into the clamorous little piazza, the sight of the peasants swilling down their sour wine appealed to me more than the masterpieces--Murray calls them so--of the famous Bolognese. It amounts after all to saying that I prefer Teniers to Domenichino; which I am willing to let pass for the truth. The scene under the rickety trellises was the more suggestive of Teniers that there were no costumes to make it too Italian. Murray's attractive statement on this point was, like many of his statements, much truer twenty years ago than to-day. Costume is gone or fast going; I saw among the women not a single crimson bodice and not a couple of classic head-cloths. The poorer sort, dressed in vulgar rags of no fashion and colour, and the smarter ones in calico gowns and printed shawls of the vilest modern fabric, had honoured their dusky tresses but with rich applications of grease. The men are still in jackets and breeches, and, with their slouched and pointed hats and open-breasted shirts and rattling leather leggings, may remind one sufficiently of the Italian peasant as he figured in the woodcuts familiar to our infancy. After coming out of the church I found a delightful nook--a queer little terrace before a more retired and tranquil drinking-shop--where I called for a bottle of wine to help me to guess why I [...] "drew the line" [...] at Domenichino.|$|R
