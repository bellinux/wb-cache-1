5|$|National {{consistency}} of governance. In 1978 the Northern Territory achieved self-government. The ACT {{was the only}} other mainland territory, with a population greater than that of the Northern Territory that was growing faster, so it was suggested that if self-government was appropriate for the Northern Territory, then it must also <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> the ACT.|$|E

Each unit is sponsored by a community organization as part of their youth program and is involved in the neighborhood and community.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E
5|$|The AFL–CIO's {{autonomous}} {{support of}} Solidarity {{was so successful}} that by 1984 both Democrats and Republicans agreed that it deserved public support. The AFL–CIO's example of open support was deemed to <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> a democracy, and much more suitable than the clandestine funding through the CIA that had occurred before 1970. Both parties and President Ronald Reagan supported a non-governmental organization, National Endowment for Democracy (NED), through which Congress would openly fund Solidarity through an allocation in the State Department's budget, beginning in 1984. The NED was designed with four core institutions, associated with {{the two major parties}} and with the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (representing business). The NED's first president was Carl Gershman, a former Director of Social Democrats, USA and former U.S. Representative to the United Nations committee on human rights. From 1984 until 1990, the NED and the AFL–CIO channeled equipment and support worth $4million to Solidarity.|$|E
