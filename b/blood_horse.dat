2500|$|After his {{retirement}} from racing, Sunday Silence attracted little support by breeders in the United States and was exported to Japan. He was Leading Sire in Japan on thirteen occasions, surpassing {{the previous record}} of ten titles by Northern Taste. Although the relatively insular nature of Japanese racing at the time meant that Sunday Silence's success was initially restricted to his home territory, his descendants have in recent years won major races in Australia, France, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, the United States and Dubai. <b>Blood</b> <b>Horse</b> pedigree expert Anne Peters said, [...] "Had Sunday Silence retired in Kentucky, it's almost certain he would have tanked commercially and been exported in disgrace, but he found his perfect gene pool and thrived instead." ...|$|E

60|$|To {{this bridge}} our friends now repaired, by {{a path that}} led through another of those groves which keep the village back from {{the shores of the}} river on the American side, and greatly help the sight-seer's {{pleasure}} in the place. The exquisite structure, which sways so tremulously from its towers, and seems to lay so slight a hold on earth where its cables sink into the ground, is to other bridges what the <b>blood</b> <b>horse</b> is to the common breed of roadsters; ant now they felt its sensitive nerves quiver under them and sympathetically through them as they advanced farther and farther toward the centre.

6000|$|Such was the housewifery in George Square. It {{was better}} at Hermiston, where Kirstie Elliott, {{the sister of}} a {{neighbouring}} bonnet-laird, and an eighteenth cousin of the lady's, bore the charge of all, and kept a trim house and a good country table. Kirstie was {{a woman in a}} thousand, clean, capable, notable; once a moorland Helen, and still comely as a <b>blood</b> <b>horse</b> and healthy as the hill wind. High in flesh and voice and colour, she ran the house with her whole intemperate soul, in a bustle, not without buffets. Scarce more pious than decency in those days required, she was the cause of many an anxious thought and many a tearful prayer to Mrs. Weir. Housekeeper and mistress renewed the parts of Martha and Mary; and though with a pricking conscience, Mary reposed on Martha's strength as on a rock. Even Lord Hermiston held Kirstie in a particular regard. There were few with whom he unbent so gladly, few whom he favoured with so many pleasantries. [...] "Kirstie and me maun have our joke," [...] he would declare, in high good-humour, as he buttered Kirstie's scones, and she waited at table. A man who had no need either of love or of popularity, a keen reader of men and of events, there was perhaps only one truth for which he was quite unprepared: he would have been quite unprepared to learn that Kirstie hated him. He thought maid and master were well matched; hard, handy, healthy, broad Scots folk, without a hair of nonsense to the pair of them. And the fact was that she made a goddess and an only child of the effete and tearful lady; and even as she waited at table her hands would sometimes itch for my lord's ears.|$|E

60|$|The art of art, {{the glory}} of {{expression}} and the sunshine of the light of letters, is simplicity. Nothing is better than simplicity--nothing can make up for excess, or {{for the lack of}} definiteness. To carry on the heave of impulse and pierce intellectual depths and give all subjects their articulations, are powers neither common nor very uncommon. But to speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insouciance of the movements of animals, and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods and grass by the roadside, is the flawless triumph of art. If you have look'd on him who has achiev'd it you have look'd on one of the masters of the artists of all nations and times. You shall not contemplate the flight of the gray gull over the bay, or the mettlesome action of the <b>blood</b> <b>horse,</b> or the tall leaning of sunflowers on their stalk, or the appearance of the sun journeying through heaven, or the appearance of the moon afterward, with any more satisfaction than you shall contemplate him. The great poet has less a mark'd style, and is more the channel of thoughts and things without increase or diminution, and is the free channel of himself. He swears to his art, I will not be meddlesome, I will not have in my writing any elegance, or effect, or originality, to hang in the way between me and the rest like curtains. I will have nothing hang in the way, not the richest curtains. What I tell I tell for precisely what it is. Let who may exalt or startle or fascinate or soothe, I will have purposes as health or heat or snow has, and be as regardless of observation. What I experience or portray shall go from my composition without a shred of my composition. You shall stand by my side and look in the mirror with me.|$|E

40|$|Acanthamoeba is a genus of ubiquitous, {{free-living}} amebae {{that can}} be difficult to isolate by standard microbiologic techniques. We retrospectively reviewed the laboratory records of patients with ocular acanthamoebic infection for the period from January 1973 to June 1996 and found that Acanthamoeba isolates were recovered from 73, 71, and 70 % of clinical specimens inoculated onto buffered charcoal-yeast extract agar (BCYE), nonnutrient agar with live or dead Escherichia coli, and tryptic soy agar (TSA) with <b>horse</b> or sheep <b>blood,</b> respectively. We then prospectively compared the recovery of a corneal isolate of Acanthamoeba on commercial media from Remel and BBL (TSA with 5 % sheep blood, TSA with 5 % <b>horse</b> <b>blood,</b> TSA with 5 % rabbit blood, V agar, chocolate agar, BCYE, and selective BCYE with polymyxin B, anisomycin, and vancomycin) and on axenic and monoxenic media prepared with live or dead bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia). Good recovery of trophozoites was obtained on BCYE, TSA with rabbit <b>blood,</b> TSA with <b>horse</b> <b>blood,</b> and Remel TSA with sheep blood.

The results showed that it is not a creation of rounded back, which is the most important for a selection of warm <b>blood</b> <b>horses</b> for their jumping abilities (V= 4. 23 to 6. 59 %) but a level of a flexion of the limbs in particular joints (V = 7. 24 to 36. 55 %) and, in the first place, a lift of the forelimbs above the hurdle (V = 37. 90 %). A highly significant influence of horse’s individuality (F = 3. 73 +++ to 28. 40 +++) and of a stage of the training (F = 2. 16 + to 32. 81 +++) on particular data was discovered, the influence of sex being insignificant and an influence of the height of the jump was statistically important only at the place of a maximal flexion of the forelimbs above a hurdle (F= 4. 41 +++).
