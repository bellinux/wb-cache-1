5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ice age {{removed the}} top {{sediment}} {{layer of the}} soil, the Kola Peninsula is on the surface extremely rich in various ores and minerals, including apatites and nephelines; copper, nickel, and iron ores; mica; kyanites; ceramic materials, as well as rare-earth elements and non-ferrous ores. Deposits of construction materials such as granite, quartzite, and limestone are also abundant. Diatomaceous earth deposits are common near lakes and are used to produce insulation.|$|E

5|$|The dodos on this islet may not {{necessarily}} {{have been the last}} members of the species. The last claimed sighting of a dodo was reported in the hunting records of Isaac Johannes Lamotius in 1688. Statistical analysis of these records by Roberts and Solow gives a new estimated extinction date of 1693, with a 95% confidence interval of 1688–1715. The authors also pointed out that <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> sighting before 1662 was in 1638, the dodo was probably already quite rare by the 1660s, and thus a disputed report from 1674 by an escaped slave cannot be dismissed out of hand.|$|E

5|$|Analyses since 2001 have {{concluded}} that Eumetazoa (more complex than sponges) are {{more closely related to}} particular groups of sponges than {{to the rest of the}} sponges. Such conclusions imply that sponges are not monophyletic, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> common ancestor of all sponges would also be a direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not sponges. A study in 2001 based on comparisons of ribosome DNA concluded that the most fundamental division within sponges was between glass sponges and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are more closely related to calcareous sponges, those with calcium carbonate spicules, than to other types of sponge. In 2007 one analysis based on comparisons of RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass sponges are more closely related to each other than either is to calcareous sponges, which in turn are more closely related to Eumetazoa.|$|E
5|$|Customers' {{reactions}} to the merger varied. Most of the public understood {{the need for the}} merger of two small companies, which were both operating in a very limited market and trying to challenge the mass producers. Some loyal Vanaja customers were astounded at the decision to discontinue the make. Some customers were upset <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> long-nosed Vanajas were equipped with cabins from Jyry-Sisu; they said they would never buy Sisu and moved to imported vehicles. Many proven technical solutions used in Vanajas were soon implemented on Sisus. The drop in the truck market was short-lived and sales soon returned to the levels experienced by Vanaja and Sisu combined in the mid-1960s. The last Vanaja vehicles were mobile cranes produced at the end of 1971; subsequently all vehicles made in the SAT Hämeenlinna works were badged as Sisus.|$|E

5|$|There {{are seven}} main plot lines that the player {{will have the}} chance to experience. Throughout gameplay, the player is given {{multiple}} options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. When first playing the game, the scenarios for all six heroines are available. Once a scenario for any one heroine is completed, that scenario will be unavailable in the next play through <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> choice that will ultimately lead to that heroine's scenario becomes unavailable for players to choose. After the completion of these six routes, the final scenario called Refrain is made available, which serves to bring everything to a definite conclusion and answers questions brought up throughout the normal gameplay. Completing Refrain makes available all the heroine's scenarios that were previously made inaccessible during gameplay so that the player can revisit the scenarios again, along with some extra decision points that were previously unavailable.|$|E

The last stanza Pie Iesu abandons rhyme for assonance, and, moreover, its lines are catalectic.|$|E
25|$|The {{first season}} of the League in 1992 was an exception, as it lasted only half a year. This was <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> Soviet league season ended {{in the autumn of}} 1991, and the Football Federation of Ukraine decided to shift the {{calendar}} from “spring-fall” to “fall-spring” football seasons. In the inaugural season, 20 clubs were divided into two 10-team groups. In both groups, each club played each other twice, and the championship was decided by a play-off match between the group winners, in which Tavriya Simferopol surprised the pre-season favorite Dynamo Kyiv.|$|E
500|$|The Illuminated Chronicle {{says that}} Árpád's father Álmos [...] "could not enter Pannonia, {{for he was}} killed in Erdelw" [...] or Transylvania. Engel, Kristó and Molnár, who accept the {{reliability}} of this report, wrote that Álmos's death was a ritual murder, similar to the sacrifice of the Khazar khagans in case of a disaster affecting their people. In contrast with them, Róna-Tas states that even if the report on Álmos's murder [...] "reflects true event, the only possible explanation would be that Árpád or someone in his entourage" [...] killed the aged prince. Spinei rejects the Illuminated Chronicles report on Álmos's murder in Transylvania, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> mention of Álmos in the contrasting narration of the Gesta Hungarorum is connected to a siege of Ungvár (Uzhhorod, Ukraine) by the Hungarians. The latter chronicle says that Álmos appointed Árpád [...] "as leader and master" [...] of the Hungarians on this occasion.|$|E

500|$|When {{reflecting}} on the casting of James Pickens, Jr., Spotnitz called him [...] "another great find", adding that [...] "so {{many times over the}} course of the series we just got so lucky with the actors that we cast in these guest parts and just kept bringing them back because they were so wonderful. That's what happened with William B. Davis as the Cigarette-Smoking Man and with Nick Lea as Krycek, and with Mitch Pileggi as Walter Skinner, and that's what happened here with James Pickens. Just a fantastic actor, not at all like this person, really transformed himself to play this part". Spotnitz thought that, for a viewer who had weekly been watching The X-Files sixth season, there was a great sense of gratification when—in the final moments of [...] "One Son"—Spender essentially withdraws and tells Kersh that Mulder has been right, all along, precisely <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> thing that Kersh wanted was for Spender to behave in this way.|$|E
500|$|Greenfield became Premier {{at a time}} of {{agricultural}} depression, especially in the province's south. [...] The region, which was responsible for approximately 75% of Alberta's wheat production, {{was in the midst of}} its fifth consecutive year of drought, and the farmers who had been responsible for putting the UFA into office were now demanding action. [...] Initially, the government offered direct financial assistance, with $5 million provided in seed and grain relief by the end of 1922. [...] However, this effort was driving the province close to bankruptcy, and in 1923 Greenfield announced an end to the handouts (the bill authorizing the last of these was a source of chagrin for MLAs from all parties, both because it marked the end of direct assistance for farmers and <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> of the assistance was itself so expensive). [...] Farmers and political representatives from the affected areas criticized the government bitterly, referencing Greenfield's earlier pledge that [...] "if the south country should fall, then we are prepared to fall with it".|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} women and death is evident in stories as early as [...] "Indian Camp". The theme of death {{permeates}} Hemingway's work. Young believes the emphasis in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] {{was not so much}} on the woman who gives birth or the father who commits suicide, but on Nick Adams who witnesses these events as a child, and becomes a [...] "badly scarred and nervous young man". Hemingway sets the events in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] that shape the Adams persona. Young believes [...] "Indian Camp" [...] holds the [...] "master key" [...] to [...] "what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career". Stoltzfus considers Hemingway's work to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in existentialism: if [...] "nothingness" [...] is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death. Those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life. Francis Macomber dies happy <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> hours of his life are authentic; the bullfighter in the corrida represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity. In his paper The Uses of Authenticity: Hemingway and the Literary Field, Timo Müller writes that Hemingway's fiction is successful because the characters live an [...] "authentic life", and the [...] "soldiers, fishers, boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature".|$|E

2500|$|State visits {{are only}} paid by invitation. Robinson's visit was a [...] "private" [...] visit. Robinson was {{not invited to}} pay a state visit during her term <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> state visit by an Irish {{president}} had occurred in April 1989, one year before her term started; the next invitation to an Irish president to pay a state visit was not due for a decade, meaning that whoever was elected in the 1990 presidential election would not be receiving an invitation to pay a state visit to the Holy See.|$|E

2500|$|The album {{from the}} outset was {{described}} {{to be different from}} any previous work the band has done.

He describes the time period with their former label as one filled with personnel turnover, which eventually led to their departure from Sony because [...] "we wanted to create an environment where {{we were going to be}} with the same people for a long time and trust is established." ...|$|E
