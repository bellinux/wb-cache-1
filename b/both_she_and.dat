5|$|Besides {{the final}} scene, other aspects were discussed: Garcia noted the acting of Richard Madden {{and how the}} Freys had been introduced. Ryan praised {{the wide range of}} {{emotions}} used by Emilia Clarke while playing Daenerys, and how Peter Dinklage played Tyrion's frustration and confusion during the episode. <b>Both</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> McNutt were glad that Tyrion's exposition scene in the tent with Bronn and Shae did not use sex to keep viewers, as was done in past episodes.|$|E

5|$|Helena was {{closest to}} her brother, Prince Alfred, who {{considered}} her his favourite sister. Though described by contemporaries as fearfully {{devoted to the}} Queen, {{to the point that}} she did not have a mind of her own, she actively campaigned for women's rights, a field the Queen abhorred. Nevertheless, <b>both</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Beatrice remained closest to the Queen, and Helena remained close to her mother's side until the latter's death. Her name was the last to be written in the Queen's seventy-year-old journal.|$|E
5|$|Helena, as promised, lived {{close to}} the Queen, and <b>both</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Beatrice {{performed}} duties for her. Beatrice, whom Victoria had groomed for the main role at her side, carried out the more important duties, and Helena took on the more minor matters that Beatrice {{did not have time}} to do. In later years, Helena was assisted by her unmarried daughter, Helena Victoria, to whom the Queen dictated her journal in the last months of her life.|$|E

5|$|A {{native of}} Pitești, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești {{was the son}} of a {{landowner}} from Olt, and, on his father's side, the descendant of immigrants from the Epirote area of Ioannina, whose ethnicity was either Aromanian or Albanian. His father became a local leader of the Conservative Party. His mother was a boyaress, and, as art collector and memoirist Krikor Zambaccian recounted, may have been a descendant of the Balotescu boyar clan. Bogdan-Pitești also had a sister, Elena Constanța Bogdan; <b>both</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> her mother reportedly survived his death. As one of his eccentricities, Bogdan-Pitești encouraged the—unsustainable—rumor that he was a direct descendant of an ancient Wallachian ruling house, the Basarab Princes.|$|E
5|$|Anita and {{the player}} get drunk {{on a table}} {{while the rest of}} the {{characters}} start dancing and flying across the room. Then the player is taken again to the room where Anita was peeling oranges, and then back to the room where <b>both</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Borges were lying shot. The player is then shown leaving the airport carrying Borges on a luggage cart.

In this area, there are several plaques showing the game's name and credits. The player leaves the area and goes into a new one where Bernoulli's principle about low and high air pressures is explained. Then, the player is again moved to the motorcycle sequence, where the game ends.|$|E

After horrifying the priest (Zak Orth) with his admissions, Elisa becomes furious with Jack and breaks up with him. Later, however, she laments her fight with Jack. After finding a McFlurry coupon in the collection plate, she believes it is a sign from God because <b>both</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Jack love the McDonald's dessert.

While searching the home of an earlier victim, the agents realize that <b>both</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Newirth had recently traveled by train. Meanwhile, Banton sits in a train station, cautiously looking at the floor; because the room is lit by soft light, his shadow cannot be seen.

5|$|Charlotte Johnson taught {{part-time}} at the Nottingham School of Art, {{and managed}} to have Knight enrolled as an 'artisan student' there, paying no fees, aged just 13. At the age of fifteen, and still a student herself, Knight took over her mother's teaching duties when Charlotte {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and became seriously ill. Later Knight won a scholarship and the gold medal in the national student competition held by the then South Kensington Museum. She continued to give private lessons after she left the School of Art, as <b>both</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> her sister Evangeline Agnes, known as Sissie, had been left to live alone on very little money, after the deaths of their mother, their sister Nellie and both their grandmothers. At the School of Art, Laura met {{one of the most promising}} students, Harold Knight, then aged 17, and determined that the best method of learning was to copy Harold's technique. They became friends, and married in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Hikari Konohana, a shy {{and quiet}} girl, {{is the main}} focus among the main {{characters}} who attend Spica. The next Spica character is Yaya Nanto, a rebellious girl who is Hikari's best friend and roommate in the dormitory. In the anime, she is very much enamored with Hikari, but Hikari sees her as a friend; in the manga, Yaya is not a prominent character. <b>Both</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Hikari {{are members of the}} St. Spica Choir. Hikari meets an older girl named Amane Ohtori early on in the story who is seen much like a prince from a fairy tale by other Spica students due to often riding a white horse named Star Bright. Amane is admired by many of the students from Spica as well as students from the other two schools, although she does not enjoy the attention. In the anime, Hikari admires her deeply, and she and Amane have mutual interest in each other. The final girl from Spica is Tsubomi Okuwaka, a young first year student who acts maturely for her age and gets on Yaya's nerves. She too is in the St. Spica Choir, although Hikari was her main motivation for joining. In the anime, her interest in Hikari seems to purely be one of friendship; in the manga, she, like Yaya, is not a prominent character. Tsubomi once remarked that Yaya was more skilled than Hikari at singing in the choir.|$|E

5|$|In 1409, Jelena {{decided to}} travel to Venice to {{negotiate}} peace in person. At the end of May, she arrived in Dubrovnik but {{had to wait for}} almost two months because her hosts warned her that there were Napolitan galleys in the Adriatic Sea. On 9 July 1409, while she was still waiting in Dubrovnik, Venice purchased the entire Dalmatian coast from Ladislaus of Naples for 100,000 ducats. The Kingdom of Naples was not a threat to Venetians anymore. By gaining the Dalmatian coast, Venetians further increased their influence and power in the region of the Adriatic Sea, which made Jelena's negotiating position difficult. When she finally arrived in Venice at the end of July, she was financially broken because of her long voyage. The Venetians had to support her with three ducats a day during negotiations which lasted for the next three months. On 26 October 1409, a year-long peace agreement with the Venetian doge, Michele Steno, was signed without territorial changes for any of the parties. Jelena traveled back to Zeta through Dubrovnik where she received 100 ducats worth of presents. Although <b>both</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> the Venetian representative swore on the Gospel to respect the truce, in reality there was no peace.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Goito was {{withdrawn}} from front-line service and converted in a minelayer, with {{a capacity for}} 60 naval mines in place of her torpedo tubes. Montebello remained on active duty until 1898, when she was converted into a training ship for engine room personnel, and was re-boilered with coal- and oil-fired equipment from several manufacturers in 1903. Confienza and Monzambano were the last {{members of the class}} to leave active service, being stricken from the naval register on the same day, 26 August 1901 and sold for scrapping. Goito continued to take part in fleet maneuvers as late as 1907 in her minelayer configuration, and <b>both</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> Manzambano remained in the Regia Marinas inventory during the Italo-Turkish War of 191112 and World War I. Neither ship saw action in either conflict, though Goito laid defensive minefields in the Adriatic Sea after Italy entered World War I in 1915. Montebello was eventually stricken on 26 January 1920, and Goito followed her to the breakers' yard on 15 March.|$|E
5|$|Across the ocean, Alex, Nall, and Ramus enter Meribia, {{where they}} meet {{one of the}} legendary Four Heroes, Mel. Attempting to sell his diamond, Ramus is swindled by a jewel dealer who flees into the sewers. After {{reclaiming}} it, Ramus slyly bargains the owner's life for his entire shop, and leaves the group to pursue his dream of becoming rich. Alex and Nash depart {{for the city of}} Vane where they meet Mia, daughter of the city's ruler and Nash's love interest, who informs them of Ghaleon, head of the guild and former great hero who fought with Dyne years ago. Seemingly intrigued by Alex's quest, Ghaleon sends Alex on a mission to investigate the appearance of a false Dragonmaster in a faraway town. Upon arrival, Alex meets Jessica, daughter of Mel and aspiring priestess, who helps him locate the imposter before returning to Vane. Pleased with his success, Ghaleon accompanies Alex back to his hometown to meet Quark and discuss Alex's future, when he suddenly attacks, revealing himself as the Magic Emperor and seemingly kills Quark in a fit of rage. Citing the loss of his friend Dyne, who died protecting the Goddess, Ghaleon swears revenge on <b>both</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> her dragons and departs after kidnapping Luna. Distraught, Alex and Nall return to Meribia to find it under attack by a band of monsters under Ghaleon's command. Regrouping with Jessica, the group fights back a wave of invaders before witnessing Mel turn to stone from a dark spell of Xenobia, Ghaleon's top general. Wanting revenge, Jessica accompanies Alex to Vane, also under siege, and assists Nash and Mia with a similar invasion before they too join the group.|$|E
