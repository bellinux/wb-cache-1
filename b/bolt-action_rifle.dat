The FRELIMO guerrillas were {{armed with a}} variety of weapons, many provided by the Soviet Union and China. Common weapons included the Mosin–Nagant <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifle,</b> SKS and AK-47 automatic rifles and the Soviet PPSh-41. Machine guns such as the Degtyarev light machine gun were widely used, along with the DShK and the SG-43 Gorunov. FRELIMO were supported by mortars, recoilless rifles, RPG-2s and RPG-7s, Anti-aircraft weapons such as the ZPU-4 and from 1974 the Strela 2.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet AVS-36, SVT-38 and SVT-40, {{as well as}} the German Gewehr 43, were {{semi-automatic}} gas-operated rifles issued during World War II {{in relatively}} small numbers. In practice, they did not replace the <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifle</b> as a standard infantry weapon.|$|E
50|$|European armies {{continued}} to develop <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifles</b> through {{the latter half}} of the nineteenth century, first adopting tubular magazines as on the Kropatschek rifle and the Lebel rifle, a magazine system pioneered by the Winchester rifle of 1866. The first <b>bolt-action</b> repeating <b>rifle</b> was the Vetterli rifle of 1867 and the first <b>bolt-action</b> repeating <b>rifle</b> to use centerfire cartridges was the weapon designed by the Viennese gunsmith Ferdinand Fruwirth in 1871. Ultimately the military turned to <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifles</b> using a box magazine; the first of its kind was the M1885 Remington-Lee, but the first to be generally adopted was the British 1888 Lee-Metford. World War I marked the height of the <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifle's</b> use, with all of the nations in that war fielding troops armed with various bolt-action designs.|$|R

25|$|The first {{successful}} {{design for a}} semi-automatic rifle is attributed to German-born gunsmith Ferdinand Ritter von Mannlicher, who unveiled the design in 1885. The Model 85 {{was followed by the}} equally innovative Mannlicher Models 91, 93 and 95 semi-automatic rifles. Although Mannlicher earned his reputation with his <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifle</b> designs, he also produced a few semi-automatic pistols, including the Steyr Mannlicher M1894, which employed an unusual blow-forward action and held five rounds of 6.5mm ammunition that were fed into the M1894 by a stripper clip.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, the American M1 Garand was {{the first}} {{semi-automatic}} rifle to replace its nation's <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifle</b> as the standard-issue infantry weapon. The gas-operated M1 Garand was developed by Canadian-born John Garand for the U.S. government at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts. After years of research and testing, the first production model of the M1 Garand was unveiled in 1937. During World War II, the M1 Garand gave American infantrymen an advantage over their opponents, {{most of whom were}} issued slower firing bolt-action rifles.|$|E
25|$|Bosse {{purchased}} the percussion rifle from an online weapons dealer. The dealer confirmed that Bosse {{had participated in}} three online auctions during the two {{months prior to the}} attack; all three auctions sold weapons. However, the auctions only sold weapons to people aged over 18 years. Attorney Wolfgang Schweer confirmed to the WDR that no investigation was launched against the auctions. The <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifle</b> that Bosse was armed with during the attack had been purchased by him from a 24-year-old male relative in exchange for an airsoft gun; the man was not aware of Bosse's true intent.|$|E

5000|$|During the conflict, {{many new}} models of <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifles</b> were {{produced}} {{as a result}} of lessons learned from the First World War with the designs of a number of <b>bolt-action</b> infantry <b>rifles</b> being modified in order to speed up production as well as to make the rifles more compact and easier to handle. Examples of <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifles</b> that were used during World War II include the German Mauser Kar98k, the British [...] Lee-Enfield No.4, and the Springfield M1903A3. During the course of World War II, <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifles</b> and carbines were modified even further to meet new forms of warfare the armies of certain nations faced e.g. urban warfare and jungle warfare. Examples include the Soviet [...] Mosin-Nagant M1944 carbine, which were developed by the Soviets {{as a result of}} the Red Army's experiences with urban warfare e.g. the Battle of Stalingrad, and the British [...] Lee-Enfield No.5 carbine, that were developed for British and Commonwealth forces fighting the Japanese in South-East Asia and the Pacific.|$|R
25|$|The first {{semi-automatic}} rifle adopted and widely issued {{by a major}} military power (France) was the Fusil Automatique Modele 1917. This is a locked breech, gas-operated action which is very similar in its mechanical principles to the future M1 Garand in the United States. The M1917 was fielded during the latter stages of World War I {{but it did not}} receive a favorable reception. However its shortened and improved version, the Model 1918, was much more favourably received during the Moroccan Rif War from 1920 to 1926. The Lebel <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifle</b> remained the standard French infantry rifle until replaced in 1936 by the MAS-36 despite the various {{semi-automatic rifle}}s designed between 1918 and 1935.|$|E
25|$|Between 1915 and 1917 {{approximately}} 300,000 M1895's were manufactured for {{the army}} of the Russian Empire, accounting for about 70% of total production of the rifles prior to 1936 when the M1895 was discontinued. Chambered in 7.62×54mmR, these versions were unusual for a lever-action rifle in that they also had a charger guide, allowing the M1895 rifle to be reloaded by the same charger clips used in the Mosin–Nagant <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifle.</b> Rifles made for the Russian contract had a longer than standard barrel fitted with an extended forestock and bayonet lug. Initial delivery of the rifles was delayed because adaptation to Russian standards, particularly the charger guide, proved more difficult than expected. Additional delays resulted from incompetent and obstructive Russian inspectors, who refused to use Winchester-made test gauges despite no Russian gauges existing, insisted that test ammunition be shipped from Russia (instead of using readily available Winchester ammunition made on Russian contract), and often rejected rifles for irrelevant flaws such as wood grain in the stock being insufficiently straight. Winchester later sold these rejected rifles on the US commercial market. Russia issued many of their Winchester Model 1895 rifles to troops from Finland and the Baltic states, especially the Latvian Riflemen. At least 9,000 Model 1895 rifles are known to have been provided by the Soviet Union in 1936 to the Spanish Republicans for use in the Spanish Civil War.|$|E

5000|$|The rimmed {{design is}} well suited for various single-shot actions, so it is {{commonly}} found there, as well. Rimmed cartridges are chambered in <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifles,</b> but [...]30-30 bolt actions are uncommon today. [...] "At one time Winchester turned out the Model 54 bolt-action repeater in this caliber WCF, {{but it was a}} decided failure, chiefly because the man desiring a bolt action preferred to take one of the better and more powerful cartridges. However, in this particular caliber, the [...]30 WCF cartridge proved to be decidedly accurate." [...] In addition, rimmed cartridges typically do not feed well with the box magazines normally found on <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifles.</b> Other examples of <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifles</b> offered in [...]30-30 Winchester are the Stevens Model 325, the Savage Model 340, the Springfield/Savage 840, and the Remington 788.|$|R

500|$|Gartrell {{was driving}} to buy {{cigarettes}} {{when he was}} arrested at about 1:30 a.m. on August 24. Police in Aurora, Colorado, a suburb east of Denver, pulled over his rented 2008 blue Dodge Ram truck, which was swerving erratically. Police found a Ruger Model M77 Mark II 22-250 <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifle</b> with an attached scope and bipod, and a Remington Remington Model 721 270 <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifle</b> with an attached hunting scope. One of the rifles was fitted with a silencer. Police also found two wigs, three fake IDs, camouflage clothing, a bulletproof vest, two walkie-talkies and 4.4grams of what appeared to be methamphetamine in the truck. The truck contained enough drug-making equipment for the vehicle to be considered [...] "a mobile lab". At least one of the rifles had been reported stolen. Gartrell was under the influence of methamphetamine when arrested. He was found to be driving on a suspended license, and was carrying a false Colorado identification card with a Centennial, Colorado address. Gartrell was using crutches {{at the time of his}} arrest.|$|E
500|$|The police {{burst through}} the door at {{approximately}} 3:45 p.m. and encountered Morrison and the hostages behind a barricade of desks at a far wall.

Morrison shot and critically wounded himself soon thereafter, simultaneously being shot by police, and died at the scene at 3:57 p.m. Keyes was taken by helicopter to a hospital in Denver, where she was pronounced dead at 4:32 p.m. The other hostage survived with no physical injuries. Investigators found no sign of explosives in the man's backpack, but three additional firearms were recovered outside the school campus: a Colt AR-15 assault rifle found in a clearing adjacent to a river about a mile north of the school, a Browning <b>bolt-action</b> <b>rifle</b> found north of the campus near U.S. Route 285, and a Smith & Wesson [...]44-caliber revolver found south of the school near a hiking trail.|$|E
