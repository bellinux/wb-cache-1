In the early 1970s, Bunker ran a profitable drug racket in San Francisco; he was arrested again when the police, who had put a tracking device on his car, followed him to a bank heist. (The police expected Bunker to lead them to a drug deal and were rather shocked by their stroke of luck.)

25|$|The Pompeians then {{attempted}} to flee over land, constantly pursued and harassed by Caesarian forces. In {{course of the}} flight, Pompeius the Younger was once more wounded, {{this time in the}} shoulder and left leg, so that his men had to carry him on a litter. The Pompeians eventually took refuge at a well defendable wooded hill near the town of Lauro, but they were discovered by a local, who reported them to the Caesarians. As result, Pompeius and his men were surrounded. The Caesarians, under command of Lucius Caesennius Lento, began to attack the Pompeian positions, <b>but</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> natural conditions, the defenders were able to repulse multiple assaults. Thus thwarted, Lento's forces settled down to besiege and starve out the Pompeians. Recognizing this, the defenders resolved to try to break through the siege.|$|E

Only the Régiment de Piedmont was in that place to confront the Spaniards. These formed in squadron at the riverside and became involved in a stubborn fight that lasted for three hours.

25|$|Equatorial Guinea is {{considered}} wealthy by African standards, with a GDP that routinely outperforms neighboring African nations, {{in most instances}} by over 300 percent, and that has grown steadily in recent years. Indeed, its per capital GDP now exceeds those of Italy, Israel, and South Korea. <b>But</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> massive diversion of funds from the national treasury into the Nguema/Mongomo group's bank accounts, the people of Equatorial Guinea live in desperate poverty, with over 60% earning less than $1 a day. Life expectancy is below 50, 57% of the people lack clean drinking water, 47% lack safe plumbing, {{and the level of}} medical care is primitive. The country has the world's fourth-highest infant mortality rate. Many of these kinds of indicators have gone from bad to worse in recent years. A 2009 UNDP report found that the difference between Equatorial Guinea's per capita GDP rank and its HDI (Human Development Index) rank was the world's highest, implying that Equatorial Guinea is the worst governed country on the planet.|$|E
25|$|New Kingdom Egypt {{reached the}} zenith {{of its power}} under Seti I and Ramesses II ("The Great"), who campaigned vigorously against the Libyans and the Hittites. The city of Kadesh was first {{captured}} by Seti I, who decided to concede it to Muwatalli of Hatti in an informal peace treaty between Egypt and Hatti. Ramesses II later attempted unsuccessfully to alter this situation in his fifth regnal year by launching an attack on Kadesh in his Second Syrian campaign in 1274 BC; he was caught in history's first recorded military ambush, <b>but</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arrival of the Ne'arin, Ramesses was able to rally his troops and turn the tide of battle against the Hittites. Ramesses II later profited from the Hittites' internal difficulties, during his eighth and ninth regnal years, when he campaigned against their Syrian possessions, capturing Kadesh and portions of Southern Syria, and advancing {{as far north as}} Tunip, where no Egyptian soldier had been seen for 120 years. He ultimately accepted that a campaign against the Hittites was an unsupportable drain on Egypt's treasury and military. In his 21st regnal year, Ramesses signed the first recorded peace treaty with Urhi-Teshub's successor, Hattusili III, and with that act Egypt-Hittite relations improved significantly. Ramesses II even married two Hittite princesses, the first after his second Sed Festival.|$|E

25|$|Aachen {{was a free}} {{imperial}} city {{of importance}} from the times of Charlemagne to the 16th century. It was the place of coronation of the King of the Germans until Maximilian II was crowned in Frankfurt in 1562. Since then, Aachen went into a slow decline. A mainly Catholic city {{at the time of}} the Peace of Augsburg, it became religiously divided in the 1560s through the immigration of Protestant refugees from the Netherlands as a consequence of the Spanish persecution during the Dutch revolt. By the 1570s Aachen's population numbered 12,000 Catholics and 8,000 Protestants. The city council and the Emperor tried to exclude the Protestants from political participation in 1581, <b>but</b> <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> economic influence of many of the Protestant citizens, Catholics were forced to allow them access to the city council. As jurisdiction over Aachen was claimed by the Duke of Jülich and the Bishop of Liege, both of them Catholics, the Catholic population appealed to the first, who complained to Emperor Rudolf II, claiming that his ecclesiastic rights over Aachen had been violated. In 1593 the Reichshofrat declared that the city council could not change the religious status of Aachen, and therefore the Calvinists had to be expelled from the council. When they tried to resist, Rudolf outlawed the city and gave the Archduke Albert, governor of the Spanish Netherlands, the task of enforcing his decision. The subsequent re-Catholicization of the city was conducted by the Archbishop of Cologne.|$|E

Mandi Bierly for Entertainment Weekly similarly noted that: [...] "So much happened in this hour that the musical numbers, though enjoyable, were almost an afterthought."

Kimberly Morales of Animation Insider commented on Lenalee's tragic backstory noting she was forced to join the Black Order organization, but her reunion with her brother Komui became [...] "paramount to her character".

Luci Christian's work as Lenalee's English voice actress was also complimented by Morales. Lenalee's new type of Innocence was well received by Chris Zimmerman of the Comic Book Bin who liked how how she accepted the powers she previously hated in order to assist Allen Walker in his fight against the 4th Level Akuma who was attacking the Black Order. This led to an appealing fight sequence which Zimmerman felt was a satisfactory end to the story arc. Manga News was more critical stating that the reason the Level 4 Akuma was defeated {{was the result of a}} power up in Lenalee.|$|E

Barbara Gordon’s Batgirl exceeded the earlier Bat-Girl and Batwoman characters in popularity, and readers requested for her to appear in other titles. Although some readers requested that Batwoman also continue to appear in publication, DC responded to the fan-based acclaim and criticism of the new character in an open letter in Detective Comics #417 (1971), stating: [...] "I'd like {{to say a few words}} about the reaction some readers have to Batgirl.
