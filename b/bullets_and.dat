50|$|Every firearm leaves unique, {{reproducible}} {{markings on}} expended <b>bullet</b> <b>and</b> cartridge cases that it fired. The barrel, firing pin, firing chamber, extractor, ejector {{and other parts}} of the gun leave these marks, called toolmarks, on the <b>bullet</b> <b>and</b> cartridge case faces. Individually and collectively, these markings function as the “ballistic signature” of the firearm.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} demonstration {{was recorded}} at 05:30 in the mainly Shia village of Nuwaidrat, where 300 people {{are said to}} have participated. The rally was led by Shia political activist Abdulwahhab Hussain. Police dispersed this rally, resulting in some injuries, and the hospitalization of one demonstrator. Police continued to disperse rallies throughout the day with tear gas, rubber <b>bullets,</b> <b>and</b> shotguns, causing additional injuries, and hospitalizing three more demonstrators.|$|E
5|$|As with {{internment}} in 1971 and Bloody Sunday in 1972, IRA recruitment was boosted, {{resulting in}} a new surge of paramilitary activity. There was an upsurge of violence after the comparatively quiet years of the late 1970s, with widespread civil disorder in Northern Ireland and rioting outside the British Embassy in Dublin. Security forces fired 29,695 plastic bullets in 1981, causing seven deaths, compared {{to a total of}} around 16,000 <b>bullets</b> <b>and</b> four deaths in the eight years following the hunger strikes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bullets</b> <b>and</b> casings {{found at}} a scene require a known example to compare {{to in order to}} match them to a weapon. Without a weapon, the {{striation}} pattern can be uploaded to a database such as the National Integrated Ballistic Identification Network (NIBIN) maintained by the ATF or the United Kingdom's National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS). Information uploaded to these databases can be used to track gun crimes and to link crimes together. Maintainers of these databases recommend that every recovered firearm be test fired and the resulting known exemplar be uploaded into the database.|$|E

5|$|Forensic firearm {{examination}} is {{the forensic}} process of examining {{the characteristics of}} firearms {{as well as any}} cartridges or bullets left behind at a crime scene. Specialists in this field are tasked with linking <b>bullets</b> <b>and</b> cartridges to weapons and weapons to individuals. Obliterated serial numbers can be raised and recorded in an attempt to find the registered owner of the weapon. Examiners can also look for fingerprints on the weapon and cartridges, and then viable prints can be processed through fingerprint databases for a potential match.|$|E

Although, he still feels {{the effects of the}} elements, sweating under the heat of the sun and freezing during winter. Danner's only vulnerability is lightning, which ultimately kills him.|$|E
5|$|Most of Clarke's time in England {{was during}} the Interregnum, when rule {{of the country was}} under Parliament and Oliver Cromwell as the Lord Protector. Clarke's primary purpose there was to secure a {{strengthened}} charter for the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations ensuring the religious liberties on which the colony had been founded, and Cromwell confirmed the validity of Rhode Island's 1643 patent. Clarke also assisted the colony in 1656 by sending home four barrels of powder and eight barrels of shot and <b>bullets,</b> <b>and</b> in 1657 he handled a letter from the colony requesting assistance with legal proceedings against William Harris.|$|E

5|$|Signs of {{the battle}} are still widely {{apparent}} in Vukovar, where many buildings remain visibly scarred by <b>bullets</b> <b>and</b> shrapnel. The riverside water tower has been preserved in its badly damaged state as a memorial. The town hospital presents an exhibition and reconstruction of the conditions in the building during the battle. At Ovčara, {{the site of the}} massacre is marked by a mass grave and exhibition about the atrocity. Local guides, some of whom lived through the battle, offer tourists the opportunity to visit these and other sites on walking and bicycle tours.|$|E
5|$|The Somali Civil War {{spread through}} the country during 1990 and {{late in the year}} there was an {{increasing}} level of criminal violence in Mogadishu. By December, the security situation began to deteriorate significantly and on December 5, Ambassador Bishop told an audience at a standing-room only meeting that he was recommending the voluntary evacuation of all dependents (i.e. children and spouses of diplomatic staff) and non-essential personnel. By December 19, the number of official US personnel in the city was reduced from 147 to 37 and of the 90 private Americans in the city, half were estimated to have left. Small-arms fire became a daily occurrence and stray <b>bullets</b> <b>and</b> shells were landing in the embassy complex.|$|E
5|$|Winning 52 games, the Pistons comfortably {{entered the}} 1987 NBA Playoffs. They swept the Washington <b>Bullets</b> <b>and</b> soundly beat the Atlanta Hawks in five games, but bowed out in seven matches against the archrival Boston Celtics {{in what was}} {{called one of the}} {{physically}} and mentally toughest series ever. Rodman feuded with Celtics guard Dennis Johnson and taunted Johnson in the closing seconds when he waved his right hand over his own head. When the Celtics took Game Seven, Johnson went back at Rodman in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture.|$|E

5|$|Acting on {{information}} from Black, Mulder concentrates {{on trying to}} find Johnson, when Scully is attacked in the morgue by the dead deputy; Johnson saves her by shooting the deputy, before disappearing. The two agents put all their effort in to finding Johnson {{before it is too}} late. Mulder breaks into Johnson's house but is locked by Johnson in his basement, where he is attacked by the four corpses of the FBI agents; he manages to shoot and kill one of them. Frank shows up; after tying up Johnson, Frank shoots two of the zombies in the head. As his gun runs out of <b>bullets</b> <b>and</b> death seems imminent for Mulder and Frank, Scully arrives and shoots the final zombie.|$|E
5|$|After a 10-day forced march north, {{and having}} {{received}} only basic medical attention, Large {{arrived at a}} prison camp outside Chongsung, about 50 miles north east of Sinuiju. He {{spent two years in}} the camp and celebrated his 21st birthday there. Throughout his incarceration he had two <b>bullets</b> <b>and</b> at least 18 pieces of shrapnel embedded in his body. To help Large cope with the chronic pain of his untreated injuries, an American POW introduced him to marijuana, which grew wild in the area. Although he found it to be a highly effective– and enjoyable– painkiller, he was somewhat alarmed by its psychoactive effects and subsequently tried to limit his use of the drug. Like many of his fellow prisoners, Large also suffered from beri-beri and dysentery.|$|E
5|$|For {{slow motion}} scenes like with <b>bullets</b> <b>and</b> drops of water, twin Phantom {{high-speed}} cameras were used which filmed 200 frames per second. A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the Resident Evil 5 game was recreated shot-by-shot {{for the film}} and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took about two days to film. The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers {{were not able to}} use existing equipment such as Steadicam rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a Segway to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot. Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a green screen. A 1983 Yak-52 was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin Mattes was dressed like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.|$|E

5|$|In January 1917, Crawford {{successfully}} {{applied to}} join the RFC as an observer with the 23rd Squadron, which flew over enemy lines to make observations and draw maps. On his maiden flight, the German Army opened fire on his aircraft, and his right foot was pierced by <b>bullets</b> <b>and</b> badly injured. To recuperate, he spent time at various hospitals in France and England before {{being sent to the}} RFC Auxiliary Hospital at the Heligan estate in Cornwall. During this time in England he spent a weekend at Wells's home in Dunmow, Essex, embracing the latter's desire for a united world government and the idea that writing about global history was a contribution to that cause. While at Heligan, Crawford began work on a book, Man and his Past, in which he examined a broad sweep of human history from an archaeological and geographical perspective.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both {{members of}} the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted {{to blow up the}} al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Etzion {{believed}} that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque. On 15 January1988, during the First Intifada, Israeli troops fired rubber <b>bullets</b> <b>and</b> tear gas at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers. On 8October1990, 22 Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police during protests that were triggered by the announcement of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group of religious Jews, {{that they were going to}} lay the cornerstone of the Third Temple.|$|E
5|$|It was {{alleged that}} the police helped the mob against the Muslim {{community}} {{on the day of}} massacre. Evidence included complaints filed by victims' family members which state that police officials fired <b>bullets</b> <b>and</b> helped the mob, resulting in the killings. It was also alleged that police guided the mob of rioters to residents' hiding places. According to Human Rights Watch, the police did nothing as houses and people were burnt and, {{on the day of the}} violence, did not respond to telephone calls until the massacre ended. Numerous eyewitnesses saw police aiming tear gas shells at, and firing upon, Muslim youths who tried to defend themselves or others. There also have been allegations that police themselves burnt houses and looted. In the violence, the extensive use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was reported, which was cited as evidence of the involvement of officials because of easy access to it.|$|E
