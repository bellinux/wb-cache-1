5|$|A notable recent {{development}} in Philosophy of Psychology is Functional Contextualism or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism {{is a modern}} philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism. It is most actively developed in <b>behavioral</b> <b>science</b> in general, the field of behavior analysis, and contextual <b>behavioral</b> <b>science</b> in particular (see the entry for the Association for Contextual <b>Behavioral</b> <b>Science).</b> Functional contextualism serves {{as the basis of}} a theory of language known as relational frame theory and its most prominent application, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism first delineated by Steven C. Hayes which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.|$|E

25|$|Androphilia and gynephilia (or gynecophilia) are terms used in <b>behavioral</b> <b>science</b> to {{describe}} sexual attraction, {{as an alternative}} to a homosexual and heterosexual conceptualization. They are used for identifying a subject's object of attraction without attributing a sex assignment or gender identity to the subject. Related terms such as pansexual and polysexual do not make any such assignations to the subject. People may also use terms such as queer, pansensual, polyfidelitous, ambisexual, or personalized identities such as byke or biphilic.|$|E

25|$|DBT draws its {{principles}} from <b>behavioral</b> <b>science</b> (including cognitive-behavioral techniques), dialectical {{philosophy and}} Zen practice. The treatment emphasizes balancing acceptance and change (hence dialectic), {{with the overall}} goal of helping patients not just survive but build a life worth living. Treatment is delivered in four stages, with self-harm and other life-threatening issues taking priority. In the second stage, patients are encouraged to experience the painful emotions {{that they have been}} avoiding. Stage three addresses problems of living such as career and marital problems. Finally, stage four focuses on helping clients feel complete and reducing feelings of emptiness and boredom.|$|E

He then graduated with honors from the Quantico FBI Training Academy in 1984. Mulder joined the FBI on October 24, 1984.

25|$|Red Dragon is Thomas Harris's second novel, after Black Sunday. As {{part of his}} {{research}} for the book he attended classes and talked to agents at the FBI <b>Behavioral</b> <b>Science</b> Unit in Quantico, Virginia, during the late 1970s. He learned about serial killers, offender profiling {{and the role of}} the FBI in serial killer investigations. After his father became terminally ill, Harris stayed for eighteen months at an isolated shotgun-style house where he worked on the book. The rural setting helped him visualize both the character of Hannibal Lecter and the Leeds murder house depicted in the story. The book is dedicated to his father.|$|E
25|$|The Association for Behavior Analysis International {{was founded}} in 1974 and by 2003 had members from 42 countries. The field has been {{especially}} influential in Latin America, where it has a regional organization known as ALAMOC: La Asociación Latinoamericana de Análisis y Modificación del Comportamiento. Behaviorism also gained a strong foothold in Japan, where it {{gave rise to the}} Japanese Society of Animal Psychology (1933), the Japanese Association of Special Education (1963), the Japanese Society of Biofeedback Research (1973), the Japanese Association for Behavior Therapy (1976), the Japanese Association for Behavior Analysis (1979), and the Japanese Association for <b>Behavioral</b> <b>Science</b> Research (1994). Today the field of behaviorism is also commonly referred to as behavior modification or behavior analysis.|$|E
25|$|Mind in the ToK system {{refers to}} the set of mental {{behaviors}}. Mental behaviors are behaviors of animals mediated by the nervous system that produce a functional effect on the animal-environment relationship. As such, Mind is essentially synonymous with what behavioral psychologists have meant when they use the term behavior. Thus, a fly avoiding a fly swatter, a rat pushing a bar or a human getting {{a drink of water}} are all mental behaviors. Mind is not synonymous with sentience or the capacity for mental experience, although such processes are presumed to emerge in the mental dimension. Cognition, in the broad sense of the term (i.e., as meaning neuro-information processing) is seen as covert mental behavior, whereas change between the animal and the environment is defined as overt mental behavior. Thus, by defining mind as mental behavior, Henriques argues that the ToK System provides a way to bridge the epistemological differences between cognitive and <b>behavioral</b> <b>science.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1990 in Caledonia, Wisconsin, a {{man named}} Edward Skur is shot by a police officer during an {{eviction}} and the last word he speaks is [...] "Mulder". Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), at this point working with the FBI's <b>Behavioral</b> <b>Science</b> Unit, believes that the man may have had some connection to his father, Bill. Mulder discovers that Skur {{was reported to have}} died in 1952. He seeks out Arthur Dales (Darren McGavin), a retired FBI agent who investigated Skur in the 1950s. At first, Dales is reluctant to discuss the case and warns Mulder away. However, Mulder's threat of a subpoena persuades Dales to tell his story.|$|E
500|$|William Petersen {{worked with}} the Chicago Police Department Violent Crimes Unit and the FBI Violent Crimes Unit in {{preparation}} for the role of Will Graham, talking to the officers and reading some of their crime files. He spoke to the investigators on the Richard Ramirez case about how they coped with the effects these disturbing cases had on them and how they learned to [...] "compartmentalize" [...] their working and personal lives. [...] "Of course you don’t really turn it off", he recalled. [...] "At the end of the day, even if you’re just a regular policeman, it takes a toll". [...] During the three years he spent working on the script, Michael Mann also spent time with the FBI's <b>Behavioral</b> <b>Science</b> Unit, where he claimed to have met people very like the character of Will Graham. This level of research led Brent E. Turvey to describe the film as [...] "one of the most competent blends of cutting-edge forensic science and criminal profiling at the time". Mann also spent several years corresponding with imprisoned murderer Dennis Wayne Wallace. Wallace had been motivated by his obsession for a woman he barely knew, and believed that Iron Butterfly's [...] "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" [...] was [...] "their song". This connection inspired Mann to include the song in the film.|$|E

500|$|As a {{freshman}} at Wisconsin in 1997, Echols was redshirted, but in 1998, he entered week one of the season as a starting cornerback opposite fellow redshirt freshman Jamar Fletcher. Against Purdue on October 11, he intercepted quarterback Drew Brees in the end zone, ending their first drive of the game. Wisconsin won 31–24. He finished the season with three interceptions. In 1999, he started the season off poorly, being beat for touchdowns often; however, as the season progressed, his performances improved. During the season, he intercepted just one pass. Before his junior season in 2000, Echols and 25 of his teammates were suspended {{for the start of}} the season by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for receiving unadvertised discounts at a shoe store. He served his one-game suspension during week two of the season, in which Wisconsin won 27–23 against Oregon. On November 4, against Minnesota, he intercepted a pass and returned it 56yards for a touchdown. He finished the season with five total interceptions, as well as a fumble recovery. Echols also set a school record with 25 pass deflections. He was named second–team All–Big Ten Conference for his performances that season. Entering 2001, Echols became the only returning member of Wisconsin's secondary after the other players either graduated or declared for the 2001 NFL Draft. In an interview about the team, secondary coach Todd Bradford said that Echols, [...] "is probably as good a tackling defensive back as there is in the country." [...] On September 27, after Wisconsin lost to Oregon early in the month, Oregon's quarterback Joey Harrington, in a diary for ESPN.com, stated that Echols, [...] "is one of the best corners I have ever played against. He was very impressive." [...] He finished his senior season at Wisconsin with three interceptions. He graduated in 2002 with a degree in <b>behavioral</b> <b>science</b> and law.|$|E
