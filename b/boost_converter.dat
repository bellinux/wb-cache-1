25|$|In {{the case}} of a {{switched-mode}} power supply, a <b>boost</b> <b>converter</b> is inserted between the bridge rectifier and the main input capacitors. The <b>boost</b> <b>converter</b> attempts to maintain a constant DC bus voltage on its output while drawing a current that is always in phase with and at the same frequency as the line voltage. Another switched-mode converter inside the power supply produces the desired output voltage from the DC bus. This approach requires additional semiconductor switches and control electronics, but permits cheaper and smaller passive components. It is frequently used in practice.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{main issue}} of {{parallel}} three-phase <b>boost</b> <b>converters</b> is {{reduction of the}} low- and high frequency circulating currents. Most present technologies concentrate on low frequency circulating current because the circulating current controller cannot mitigate the high frequency circulating current. In this paper, analytical approach of three-phase coupled inductor applied to parallel system becomes an important objective to effectively reduce the low- and high frequency circulating currents. The characteristics of three-phase coupled inductor based on a structure and voltage equations are mathematically derived. The modified voltage equations are then applied to parallel three-phase <b>boost</b> <b>converters</b> to develop averaged models in stationary coordinates and rotating coordinates. Based on the averaged modeling approach, design of the circulating current controller is presented.

40|$|Power {{efficiency}} {{is critical for}} electrical stimulators. Battery life of wearable stimulators and wireless power transmission in implanted systems are common limiting factors. <b>Boost</b> DC/DC <b>converters</b> are typically needed to increase the supply voltage of the output stage. Traditionally, <b>boost</b> DC/DC <b>converters</b> are used with fast control to regulate the supply voltage of the output. However, since stimulators are acting as current sources, such voltage regulation is not needed. Banking on this, this paper presents a DC/DC conversion strategy aiming to increase power efficiency.
