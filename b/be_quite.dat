5|$|Also defined herewith: orbital ring. A visible ring of {{feathers}} around a bird's eye; the eye-ring is often paler than the surrounding feathers. By contrast, an orbital ring is bare skin ringing the eye. In some species, such as little ringed plover, the orbital ring may <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|Banksia grossa is {{cultivated}} for its attractive needle-like {{leaves and}} rusty-brown flower spikes, {{both of which}} can <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> variable in colour. This species favours well-drained sandy or loamy acidic soils with a pH of 5.5 to 7, and a sunny aspect. Once established, it tolerates dry spells. It can be pruned heavily as it resprouts from its lignotuber.|$|E

5|$|Navarro, for his part, {{pressured}} by Madero, {{tried to keep}} the ceasefire {{for as long as he}} could. This proved to <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> costly to the defenders. The rebel forces captured the outer defenses of the city unopposed, as no federal officer was willing to countermand the orders to hold fire. Instead, the troops withdrew deeper into the city.|$|E
5|$|As well as plant based poisons, {{there are}} others that are made {{that are based on}} animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that can <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E

5|$|Between the {{extremes}} of bicycles with classical front-wheel steering and those with strictly rear-wheel steering is a class of bikes with a pivot point somewhere between the two, referred to as center-steering, and similar to articulated steering. An early implementation of the concept was the Phantom bicycle in the early 1870s promoted as a safer alternative to the penny-farthing. This design allows for simple front-wheel drive and current implementations appear to <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> stable, even rideable no-hands, as many photographs illustrate.|$|E
5|$|Differentiating between {{infectious}} and non-infectious illness, {{and identifying}} the underlying etiology of infection, can <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> challenging. For example, {{more than half}} of cases of encephalitis remain undiagnosed, despite extensive testing using state-of-the-art clinical laboratory methods. Metagenomic sequencing shows promise as a sensitive and rapid method to diagnose infection by comparing genetic material found in a patient's sample to a database of thousands of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Like many ink caps, {{it grows}} in tufts. It is {{commonly}} associated with buried wood and is found in grassland, meadows, disturbed ground, and open terrain from late spring to autumn. Fruiting bodies {{have been known to}} push their way up through asphalt and even tennis courts. It is also common in urban areas and appears in vacant lots, and tufts of fungi can <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> large and fruit several times a year. If dug up, the mycelium can often be found originating on buried dead wood.|$|E

5|$|Pork steaks are {{generally}} {{cut from the}} shoulder of the pig, but can also be cut from the loin or leg of the pig. Shoulder steaks are cut from the same primal cut of meat most commonly used for pulled pork, and can <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> tough without long cooking times due to the high amount of collagen in the meat; therefore, pork shoulder steaks are often cooked slower than a typical beef steak, and may be stewed or simmered in barbecue sauce during cooking.|$|E
5|$|Secondary School {{is a big}} {{waste of}} time. What are French {{teachers}} doing? None of us can speak French. How much maths can you do? Do you know any history? What is the point in training people {{to do things that}} none of us can do? The system seems designed to qualify you for the Indian Civil Service in 1911. We all leave school unable to drive! Now that would <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> handy.|$|E
5|$|The Boletus pinophilus is edible, {{and may be}} used fresh, preserved, {{dried and}} cooked {{in a manner similar}} to that of other edible boletes. It is highly {{regarded}} and can <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> expensive in central Mexico, and is often sold dried there. The flesh is white, soft in mature specimens and does not change colour upon bruising. The taste and smell is pleasant. People of La Malinche have likened the flavour to pork and pork crackling. It is easily misidentified as the porcini Boletus edulis, due to the similar habitat and appearance.|$|E

5|$|The Danube crested newt's {{back and}} sides are dark brown with black spots and white stippling. The belly is orange to red (in other crested newts, {{it is usually}} yellow or orange–yellow), with small or {{medium-sized}} black blotches that have sharp edges. Like all crested newts, T.dobrogicus males develop a crest on their back and tail during breeding phase, which can <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> high and jagged and usually starts between the eyes and nostrils. Another feature of males at breeding season is a bluish-white stripe along the tail.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of time until an eventual reward also affects participants' choice of immediate or delayed gratification. A 2001 study demonstrated {{that if a}} reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, {{the bulk of the}} participants choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward would <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> large. Delayed gratification has its limits, and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be not worth the effort it takes to wait.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact through electromagnetic waves would probably <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> small, especially at first. However, if the message contains {{a large amount of}} information, deciphering it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the human species itself, which may greatly advance our technology and science. A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists as they come to know that what they are researching may already be known to another civilization.|$|E

5|$|The western rock {{nuthatch}} builds an elaborate flask-shaped nest from mud, dung and hair or feathers, and decorates the nest's exterior and nearby crevices with feathers and insect wings. The nests are located in rock crevices, in caves, under cliff overhangs or on buildings. The eastern {{rock nuthatch}} builds a similar but less complex structure across {{the entrance to a}} cavity. Its nest can <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> small but may weigh up to 32kg (70lb). This species will also nest in river banks or tree holes and will enlarge its nest hole if it the cavity is too small.|$|E
5|$|Upon heating, α-berkelium {{transforms}} {{into another}} phase with an fcc lattice (but slightly different from β-berkelium), space group Fmm and {{the lattice constant}} of 500pm; this fcc structure {{is equivalent to the}} closest packing with the sequence ABC. This phase is metastable and will gradually revert to the original α-berkelium phase at room temperature. The temperature of the phase transition is believed to <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> close to the melting point.|$|E
5|$|A Great Eruption event {{similar to}} Eta Carinae A's {{has only been}} {{observed}} in one other star in the Milky Way—P Cygni—and {{in a handful of}} other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None of them seem to <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> as violent as Eta Carinae's. It is unclear if this is something that only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.|$|E
