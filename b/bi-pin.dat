25|$|Non-integrated CFLs {{have the}} ballast {{permanently}} {{installed in the}} luminaire, and usually only the fluorescent tube is changed at its end of life. Since the ballasts are placed in the light fixture, they are larger and last longer compared to the integrated ones, and they don't {{need to be replaced}} when the tube reaches its end-of-life. Non-integrated CFL housings can be both more expensive and sophisticated. They have two types of tubes: a <b>bi-pin</b> tube designed for conventional ballast, and a quad-pin tube designed for an electronic ballast or a conventional ballast with an external starter. A <b>bi-pin</b> tube contains an integrated starter, which obviates the need for external heating pins but causes incompatibility with electronic ballasts.|$|E
50|$|T5 lamps are {{approximately}} 40% smaller than T8 Lamps. T5 lamps have a miniature <b>bi-pin</b> base while T8 lamps use a medium <b>bi-pin</b> base.|$|E
50|$|A GU24 {{lamp fitting}} is a <b>bi-pin</b> {{connector}} for {{compact fluorescent lamps}} (CFL) or LED lamps that uses a bayonet mount-like twist-lock <b>bi-pin</b> connector instead of the Edison screw fitting used on many incandescent light bulbs.|$|E
5000|$|Wedge bases are {{designated}} {{with the letter}} W and possibly a second letter indicating the exact type (often keyed to prevent the wrong colors from being used in automobiles), the thickness in millimetres, a lowercase x, the width in millimeters, and a lowercase d to indicate a double-contact (single-filament) bulb or q for a quad-contact (dual-filament) one. Like small <b>bi-pins,</b> the measurement may be expressed as a decimal, such as 2.5, instead of a whole number.|$|R

50|$|The <b>bi-pin</b> {{base was}} invented by Reginald Fessenden for the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago. After Westinghouse won the {{contract}} to wire and illuminate the first electrified fair with AC instead of archrival Thomas Edison's DC, Edison and his General Electric company refused to allow his patented Edison screw-base bulbs to be used. Westinghouse overcame this by inventing the <b>bi-pin</b> base for use at the fair.|$|E

50|$|While G {{actually}} indicates <b>bi-pin,</b> those {{listed above}} have a twist-lock, but with parallel pins {{from the end}} instead of opposing pins on the side.|$|E
50|$|Although {{several types}} of fixture-ballasted compact {{fluorescent}} bulbs (such as the common PL-13) use a large wedge-like base, they are designated as <b>bi-pin</b> or quad-pin bases.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to Edison's patent, Reginald Fessenden invented the <b>bi-pin</b> connector for the 1893 World's Fair. Other lamp bases include the bayonet mount and wedge base.|$|E
50|$|T5 lamps are {{approximately}} 40% smaller than T8 lamps and almost 60% smaller than T12 lamps. T5 lamps have a G5 base (<b>bi-pin</b> with 5 mm spacing).|$|E
50|$|LED lamps {{are made}} of arrays of SMD modules that replace {{incandescent}} or compact fluorescent lamps, mostly replacing incandescent lamps rated from 5 to 60 watts. Such lamps are made with standard lamp connections and shapes, such as an Edison screw base, an MR16 shape with a <b>bi-pin</b> base, or a GU5.3 (<b>bi-pin</b> cap) or GU10 (bayonet fitting) and are made compatible with the voltage supplied to the sockets. They include driver circuitry to rectify the AC power and convert the voltage to an appropriate value, usually a switched-mode power supply.|$|E

5000|$|A {{lowercase}} [...] "q" [...] {{at the end}} of {{the designation}} indicates that it is a quad-pin base, with two <b>bi-pin</b> pairs. These are used with compact fluorescent tubes that plug into a light fixture that has a permanent ballast.|$|E
50|$|A bipin or <b>bi-pin,</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as two-pin, bipin cap or bipin socket), is a standard from the IEC for lamp fittings. These are used on many small incandescent light bulbs (especially halogen lamps), and for starters on some types of fluorescent lights as well.|$|E
50|$|Most MR lamps {{consist of}} a halogen capsule (or, bulb) {{integrated}} with a pressed glass reflector with a base conforming to <b>bi-pin</b> GU5.3 standard. The compact size of the MR base allows for much smaller, more discreet fixtures than the incandescent reflector bulbs that pre-dated MRs.|$|E
50|$|Non-integrated CFLs {{have the}} ballast {{permanently}} {{installed in the}} luminaire, and usually only the fluorescent tube is changed at its end of life. Since the ballasts are placed in the light fixture, they are larger and last longer compared to the integrated ones, and they don't {{need to be replaced}} when the tube reaches its end-of-life. Non-integrated CFL housings can be both more expensive and sophisticated. They have two types of tubes: a <b>bi-pin</b> tube designed for conventional ballast, and a quad-pin tube designed for an electronic ballast or a conventional ballast with an external starter. A <b>bi-pin</b> tube contains an integrated starter, which obviates the need for external heating pins but causes incompatibility with electronic ballasts.Non-integrated CFLs can also be installed to a conventional light fixture using an adapter containing a built-in magnetic ballast. The adapter consists of a regular bulb screw, the ballast itself and a clip for the lamp's connector.|$|E
5000|$|GU10 is a <b>bi-pin</b> {{connector}} designation. A common {{derivative of}} the MR housing is GU10 (G for glass) {{which is a}} lamp cap fitting format created by Havells Sylvania in 1997. [...] GU10 is distinguished from the MR lamps by the U-shaped ceramic base mount with a 10 mm (pin center-to-center distance) 2-pin bayonet mount and operating under mains voltage rather than lower voltage.|$|E
50|$|Halogen {{multifaceted}} reflector bulbs {{are widely}} available. The most common format is MR16, {{which is available}} in 10-50 W power ratings (150-800 lumens).Low voltage lamps use the MR16 and similar <b>bi-pin</b> bases, whereas mains voltage lamps use the same caps as normal mains tungsten filament lamps, or a special GU10/GZ10 base. The GU10/GZ10 bases are shaped to prevent dichroic reflector lamps being used in luminaires intended for aluminised reflector lamps, which could cause overheating of the fitting. Higher efficiency LED versions {{of all of these}} lamps are now available, but these have widely varying light output and quality.|$|E
5000|$|The bulb is {{inserted}} and removed with straight {{in or out}} force, without turning as with a bayonet mount or Edison screw, on certain <b>bi-pin</b> light sockets. For true wedges, compression is the force that holds the bulb in, while others use simple friction, or snap into a socket with spring-loaded electrical contacts that [...] "grab" [...] the corners or other protrusions on the base to prevent loosening from vibration. In contrast, a [...] "slide base" [...] (sometimes [...] "telephone slide base") lamp also {{is inserted}} in a socket without rotation, but has two long contacts {{on either side of}} the lamp envelope connected to the lead wires.|$|E
5000|$|A wedge base {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} connector used as a fitting for small light bulbs. It is similar to the <b>bi-pin</b> connector, except that the two [...] "pins" [...] are the same wires that extend into the bulb (rather than being rigid), and the wires are bent up onto the sides of the base, where they make contact with the socket. The wires are usually inserted into a plastic base that the bulb is mounted in, and which is often narrower at the tip than at the bulb, giving it a wedge shape and usually ensuring a tight connection, depending on manufacturing tolerances. Some bulbs have no plastic base, and the wires are simply bent up to the sides of the bulb's glass base.|$|E
