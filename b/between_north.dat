5|$|During {{the nearby}} Second Battle of Naktong Bulge, the North Korean People's Army {{broke through the}} US Army's 2nd Infantry Division lines along the Naktong River.

What followed was a fight <b>between</b> <b>North</b> Korean and US forces for Yongsan.|$|E

5|$|Gaza's {{history of}} {{habitation}} dates back 5,000 years, {{making it one}} of the oldest cities in the world.

5|$|Grown on agar plates, the mycelia of A.serialiformis and A.serialis have {{identical}} chemical reactivity, and {{are rather}} similar in appearance, although the authors {{note that the}} former's was more cottony than the latter's.

Similar pairings performed <b>between</b> <b>North</b> American and European collections showed the species to be incompatible, and therefore distinct.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the extent}} of its {{contribution}} to the actual temperature differential <b>between</b> <b>North</b> America and Europe {{is a matter of}} dispute, as there is a recent minority opinion within the science community that this temperature difference (beyond that caused by contrasting maritime and continental climates) is mainly due to atmospheric waves created by the Rocky Mountains.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, {{the road}} between Leonardtown and Mechanicsville and from south of Camp Springs to the Washington, D.C. border was {{completed}} {{as a state}} highway while the sections between south of Beantown and the border between Charles and Prince George's counties and between TB and Camp Springs were under contract. At this time, the road between Point Lookout and Leonardtown, Mechanicsville and Beantown, and the Charles-Prince George's county border and TB were proposed as state highways. By 1915, {{the entire length of}} the state highway <b>between</b> <b>north</b> of Point Lookout and the Washington, D.C. border was completed. This state highway was paved to the northwest of Leonardtown, <b>between</b> <b>north</b> of Morganza and Hughesville, between the Charles-Prince George's county border and north of TB, and from south of Camp Springs to the Washington, D.C. border while the remainder was an unpaved state road.|$|E
5|$|Later, the counter-coup of 1966, {{supported}} {{primarily by}} Northern military officers, facilitated {{the rise of}} Lt. Colonel Yakubu Gowon to head of state.

The Aleutian Islands hold a population of mallards that appear to be evolving towards a subspecies, as gene flow with other populations is very limited.|$|E

5|$|North Vietnam's {{victory over}} the South led to a {{considerable}} shift in the political winds in Asia, and Ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of U.S. influence there. The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its {{interests in the region}} on two occasions, once when Khmer Rouge forces seized an American ship in international waters and again when American military officers were killed in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) <b>between</b> <b>North</b> and South Korea.|$|E

5|$|The world's {{production}} of molybdenum was 250,000 tonnes in 2011, the largest producers being China (94,000t), United States (64,000t), Chile (38,000t), Peru (18,000t) and Mexico (12,000t). The total reserves are estimated at 10 million tonnes, and are mostly concentrated in China (4.3Mt), US (2.7Mt) and Chile (1.2Mt). By continent, 93% of world molybdenum production is about evenly shared <b>between</b> <b>North</b> America, South America (mainly in Chile), and China.

5|$|After leaving Sag Harbor, NY114 {{encounters}} a modern roundabout {{at the intersection}} of Short Beach Road (County Route60 or CR60) and Tyndall Road. NY114 makes a turn through the roundabout and then travels one more mile through North Haven before reaching the first of two ferries along its route. Shelter Island's two ferries, both of which technically carry NY114, are operated by two different companies. The South Ferry (<b>between</b> <b>North</b> Haven and Shelter Island) is operated by the South Ferry Company and the North Ferry (between Shelter Island Heights and Greenport) is operated by the North Ferry Company. Since the two entities are separate, there is no incentive to use both ferries, although both companies offer discounts for round trip fares and for Shelter Island residents.|$|E
5|$|Although Cooper {{voted in}} favor of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, he opposed {{escalating}} U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. As early as April 1964, Cooper was urging President Johnson to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the tensions in Southeast Asia. He questioned Southeast Asia's strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a global scale. On March 25, 1965, he joined New York Senator Jacob Javits in a call for President Johnson to begin negotiations for a settlement <b>between</b> <b>North</b> Vietnam and South Vietnam without imposing preconditions on the negotiations. Later in the day, he introduced resolutions calling for Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to brief the full Senate on recent developments in Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Christian {{missions}} established Western {{educational institutions}} in the Protectorates. Under Britain's policy of indirect rule and validation of Islamic tradition, the Crown did not encourage the operation of Christian missions in the northern, Islamic part of the country. Some children of the southern elite went to Great Britain to pursue higher education. By independence in 1960, regional differences in modern educational access were marked. The legacy, though less pronounced, continues to the present day. Imbalances <b>between</b> <b>North</b> and South were expressed in Nigeria's political life as well. For instance, northern Nigeria did not outlaw slavery until 1936 whilst {{in other parts of}} Nigeria slavery was abolished soon after colonialism.|$|E

In August 1950, Kouma, who was then a Sergeant First Class, sailed for Korea along {{with much of the}} 2nd Infantry Division. It arrived there in late August and was moved into line at the Pusan Perimeter, where US troops were fighting a tight defensive line around the port city of Pusan.|$|E
