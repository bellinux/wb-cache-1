2500|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} can {{be performed}} as a batch process or a continuous process. In a <b>batch</b> <b>system,</b> biomass {{is added to the}} reactor {{at the start of the}} process. The reactor is then sealed for the duration of the process. In its simplest form batch processing needs inoculation with already processed material to start the anaerobic digestion. In a typical scenario, biogas production will be formed with a normal distribution pattern over time. Operators can use this fact to determine when they believe the process of digestion of the organic matter has completed. There can be severe odour issues if a batch reactor is opened and emptied before the process is well completed. A more advanced type of batch approach has limited the odour issues by integrating anaerobic digestion with in-vessel composting. In this approach inoculation takes place through the use of recirculated degasified percolate. After anaerobic digestion has completed, the biomass is kept in the reactor which is then used for in-vessel composting before it is opened [...] As the batch digestion is simple and requires less equipment and lower levels of design work, it is typically a cheaper form of digestion. Using more than one batch reactor at a plant can ensure constant production of biogas.|$|E

These <b>systems</b> are frequently used by chemical of food industry. <b>Batch</b> <b>systems</b> deal with concurrent activities and resource allocation mechanism. As a consequence a natural model for these systems are Petri nets. However they are not well suited for modelling continuous behaviour. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present an extension of Petri nets in order to model <b>batch</b> <b>systems.</b> Based on a toy example of a billiard table [14], the paper shows the limits of Petri nets. Hybrid Petri nets are not satisfactory because, although they are well suited for modelling vessels, they do not cover the range of <b>batch</b> <b>systems.</b> High-level nets, as coloured Petri nets [12], are a common model for <b>batch</b> <b>systems.</b> However, based on the toy example, the limits of coloured Petri net is illustrated. An extension of high-level Petri nets is presented through the billiard example: differential-predicate-transition nets [3]. The new concept introduced by this model is that it is a Petri net with continuous variables whose evolution is dynamic and represented through sets of differential algebraic equations. Key-Words: Petri nets, high-level nets, hybrid systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} types of {{anaerobic}} digesters for solid wastes were compared based on biological and technical performance and reliability. A first distinction was made among one-stage, two-stage, and <b>batch</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Batch</b> <b>systems</b> are the lowest-tech of all systems {{and also the}} cheapest. Their major drawbacks are a large footprint and a lower biogas yield due to the impairment of the percolation process via channeling and clogging. <b>Batch</b> <b>systems</b> have a high potential for application in developping countries. Two-stage systems are the most complex, and most expensive, of all systems. Their greatest advantage lies in the buffering of the organic loading rate {{taking place in the}} first stage, allowing a more constant feeding rate of the methanogenic second stage. This is a substantial advantage in the case of substrates whose degradation is limited by 2 Biomethanization of OFMSW the methanogenesis rather than by the hydrolysis, e. g. cellulose-poor kitchen wastes.
