500|$|In 1989, Joe Crandall, {{an inmate}} at a federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania, hears {{screaming}} from the infirmary. Inside, he discovers the prison's doctor, Joe Ridley, amputating {{the hand of}} fellow inmate John Barnett. Ridley tells Crandall that Barnett is dead, threatening him with a scalpel. However, as Crandall leaves the room, he sees Barnett <b>blinking</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{priorities}} for Goldwyn was to shorten {{the length of the}} show to at least three hours or less. In view of his goal, he told reporters regarding winner's acceptance speeches, [...] "We are actually going to give them 45 seconds. The light (next to the camera) will start <b>blinking</b> <b>at</b> 45 seconds and go red at 55 seconds. After one minute we will either cut to a commercial or go to something else. We've also asked multiple winners to flip a coin and pick a spokesman." [...] Furthermore, instead of each Best Original Song nominee being performed separately, all five songs were performed as part of a musical number featuring actress Bernadette Peters singing brief introductions to each one. Although Goldwyn attempted to move the Documentary and Short Film Categories to a separate ceremony from the broadcast, the AMPAS Board of Governors refused to do so.|$|E

60|$|He sank softly {{into the}} chair towards which I had pointed. For a moment he sat and <b>blinked</b> <b>at</b> me behind his gold-rimmed spectacles.|$|R
