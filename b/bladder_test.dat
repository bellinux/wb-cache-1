MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe experimental studies of the bladder cooling response, and more recent clinical retrospective and prospective studies of the <b>bladder</b> cooling <b>test</b> in adults and children. RESULTS: Studies indicate {{the existence of a}} segmental spinal bladder cooling reflex that originates from specific cold receptors in the bladder and urethral walls supplied by unmyelinated C-afferents. The reflex is positive in neurologically normal infants and children until about age 4 years. It becomes negative with further maturation of the nervous system but may be unmasked by pathological processes that disturb the descending neuronal control of normal voiding. A positive test in a patient with an overactive bladder requires further neurourological evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The bladder cooling response originates from cold receptors within the walls of the lower urinary tract. The cooling response represents a neonatal reflex that may be unmasked by central neuropathology, analogous to the appearance of the Basbinki sign in pyramidal tract lesions. The <b>bladder</b> cooling <b>test</b> is a simple and valuable tool to support the diagnosis of neurourological disorders...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cystoscopy with urinary {{cytology}} is {{the gold}} standard for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with tumors of the urinary bladder. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the performance of the nuclear matrix protein 22 (NMP 22) tumor marker test, BladderChekr point-of-care test and voided urinary cytology for the detection and follow-up of bladder tumors. METHODS: NMP 22 was measured using an ELISA assay in stabilized voided urine and using the BladderChekr test. Voided urinary cytology was performed on urine samples. Results were compared to cystoscopic findings and histopathological examination results after transurethral resection of the bladder lesion. RESULTS: For the prediction of malignant histopathological result, sensitivity and specificity were 45. 2 % and 75. 0 %, respectively, for NMP 22 at a cut-off of 7. 5 kU/L, 17. 7 % and 100 % for the BladderChekr test and 37. 0 % and 100 % for voided urine cytology. For the prediction of suspicious or positive cystoscopic finding, sensitivity and specificity were 40. 4 % and 72. 1 %, respectively, for NMP 22 at a cut-off of 7. 5 kU/L, 14. 8 % and 93. 8 % for the <b>Bladder</b> Chekr <b>test</b> and 26. 8 % and 98. 1 % for voided urine cytology. CONCLUSIONS: The NMP 22 quantitative test showed higher sensitivity and lower specificity compared with voided urine cytology, whereas the sensitivity of the <b>Bladder</b> Chekr <b>test</b> was low.

Intravenous injection of E. coli endotoxin in dogs resulted in necrosis and thrombosis of vessels that were especially severe in the serosa and muscularis of the gallbladder but also present in vessels of many other organs.

30|$|In {{accordance}} with all formerly published surveys, IAP measurement via the bladder {{is the most}} frequently used technique also in Germany (Table 1). Of the respondents, 70 % stated that a simpler, more standardized technique would be used more often to assess IAP. This impression is supported by the finding that some respondents refuse bladder pressure measurement because the technique may 'not be established' or appears 'too complex in technical regards'. Both points of criticism appear unjustified. Several studies in humans as well as in animals proved replicability and reliability of the method [24, 25]. Further, the measurement techniques have become increasingly simple and user-friendly over the last years, making it no longer possible to speak of an overly complicated IAP measurement technique. For example, the manometer technique, published by Harrahill in 1998 [26] and perfected by Lee [27], offers a maximum simplification of the <b>bladder</b> pressure <b>test</b> and requires no additional instruments other than a ruler and trans-urethral catheter. Using this principle, even commercially available measurement systems have been developed (for example Foleymanometer, Holtech® medical, Charlottenlund, Denmark). Nevertheless, a minimum amount of training for personnel is required to avoid certain pitfalls. This includes, for example, ruling out a neurogenic or organic bladder dysfunction, ensuring sufficient relaxation of the local abdominal muscles, and the correct steady positioning of the patient with a continuous transparent reference point for the measurement of pressure equivalents.|$|R

Female rats received a contusion injury at T 8 / 9. The AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist NBQX was directly administered into the lesion site immediately after injury. Nine days post-injury, NRP/GRP were delivered into the lesion site. Controls received NRP/GRP grafts only or no treatment (OP-Controls). Animals underwent <b>bladder</b> function <b>testing</b> {{during the course of the}} experiment and at the endpoint. Motor function was evaluated as well. After sacrifice, histological analysis of lesion site and lumbosacral spinal cord regions was performed. Rats receiving the combined treatment (NBQX&NRP/GRP) had voided volumes/micturition resembling that of normal animals and showed greater improvement of urodynamic parameters, compared to NRP/GRP alone or OP-Controls. Similarly, NBQX&NRP/GRP induced more spouting, regeneration or sparing of descending projections to the lumbosacral cord. The density of primary afferent projections at the lumbosacral spinal cord in rats with combined treatments was similar to that of NRP/GRP alone with decreased sprouting of primary afferents in lumbosacral cord, compared to OP-Control. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed that the combined treatment reduced the size of the lesion to a greater extent than NRP/GRP alone or OP-Controls. NRP/GRP with and without NBQX produced a significant recovery of hindlimb compared to OP-Controls. In conclusion, transplants of NRP/GRP combined with NBQX promote recovery of micturition function following {{spinal cord injury}}, likely through increased neuroprotection...|$|R

Mean gastric clearance of radioopaque markers ingested with a meal averaged 29. 5 (2. 3) markers per six hours in subjects without cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy compared with 17. 8 (2. 3) markers per six hours in {{patients with}} cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (p < 0. 02). Gall bladder emptying in response to graded CCK 8 stimulation was impaired in five of 11 patients with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, whereas it was normal in the patients without cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (p < 0. 01).

The antibody was used as an immunogen to generate two mouse monoclonal antibodies, 21 D 9 and 43 A 10, which bind to idiotopes on antibody 6. 10 associated with the binding site for the 175 -kDa antigen. The antiidiotypic antibodies induced bladder tumor-specific, cell-mediated immunity when injected into syngeneic mice, as shown by delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions in vivo and leukocyte adherence inhibition reactions in vitro. Tumor specificity was demonstrated by employing as controls a chemically induced BALB/c fibrosarcoma, MCA- 1511 (MCA, 3 -methylcholanthrene), and its corresponding antiidiotypic antibody, 5. 96. Lymphocytes from mice sensitized with antibody 21 D 9 or 5. 96 specifically recognized antigens in extracts of BALB/c bladder carcinoma BTCC- 1660 (BTCC, bladder transitional cell carcinoma) and sarcoma MCA- 1511, respectively, as shown by leukocyte adherence inhibition reactivity. This reactivity was selectively abrogated by prior treatment of the sensitized cells with the appropriate antiidiotypic antibodies and complement. An antigen recognized in vitro by antibody 21 D 9 -sensitized lymphocytes could be separated from BTCC- 1660 extract by immunoabsorption with antibody 6. 10 and elution with acidic buffer. Our findings indicate that the oncofetal antigen defined by antibody 6. 10 is recognized by the immune system of syngeneic mice and suggest that antiidiotypic antibodies related to certain oncofetal antigens can be used to immunize against syngeneic tumors...|$|R

Experimentally, we have previously demonstrated that OAB is associated with the generation of free radicals and oxidative damage to the <b>bladder.</b> We <b>tested</b> the hypothesis that the combination of solifenacin + coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10)  + α-lipoic acid (α-LA) is more effective in treating OAB than the individual compounds. Materials and MethodsIn total, 48 male New Zealand White rabbits were separated into 8 groups of 6 rabbits each. The following oral treatments were given to each group: groups 1 and 5 received vehicle (saline); groups 2 and 6 received solifenacin; groups 3 and 7 received CoQ 10  + α-LA; and groups 4 and 8 received solifenacin + CoQ 10  + α-LA. After 3 weeks of treatment (by oral gavage), rabbits in groups 1 to 4 received partial outlet obstruction. The rabbits continued their treatments for 4 weeks following surgery. At the end of this 4 -week period, each rabbit received cystometry and then underwent an in situ study for OAB.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to describe and demonstrate a new model of developing patient reported outcomes (PROs) that are patient-centered, and to test the hypothesis that following this model would result in a qualitatively different PRO than if the typical PRO development model were followed. The typical process of developing PROs begins with an initial list of signs or symptoms originating from clinicians or PRO developers; patient validation of this list ensures that the list (i. e., the new PRO) is interpretable by patients, but not that patient perspectives are central or even represented. The new model begins with elicitation from clinicians and patients independently and separately. These perspectives are formally analyzed qualitatively, and the results are iteratively integrated by researchers, supporting clinical relevance and patient centeredness. We describe the application of this new model {{to the development of a}} PRO for urinary signs and symptoms in individuals with neuropathic <b>bladder,</b> and <b>test</b> the hypothesis that the two processes generate qualitatively different instruments using a national validation sample of 300 respondents.

The three most-endorsed items came from the patients, and the three least-endorsed items came from clinical guidelines. Thematic qualitative analysis of the elicitation process, as well as the results from our national sample, support the conclusion that the new model yields an instrument that is clinically interpretable, but more patient-centered, than the typical model would have done in this context...|$|R
40|$|Recurrent {{inhibition}} of the bladder C fibre reflex was studied in adult female cats anaesthetized with α-chloralose. Test reflexes were evoked by electrical stimulation of bladder Aδ and C afferents {{in the right}} pelvic nerve and were recorded from the proximal end of a small ipsilateral pelvic nerve branch, transected close to the <b>bladder.</b> Such <b>test</b> reflexes were consistently depressed by repetitive electrical stimulation of the contralateral bladder pelvic nerve (20 Hz, 20 s) at intensities sufficient to recruit axons of bladder preganglionic neurones. The inhibition could be evoked after transection of the left dorsal roots S 1 –S 4 and the sympathetic supply to the bladder but was abolished by transection of the pelvic nerve central {{to the site of}} stimulation. Hence, it most likely involved central recurrent collaterals of antidromically activated bladder preganglionic neurones. The reflex suppression was quite considerable – maximal C fibre reflexes were reduced to a group mean of 25 % (± 9 % confidence interval) of their control size. The effect had a slow onset, requiring a few seconds of conditioning stimulation to be revealed, and was very long lasting (minutes). Naloxone (0. 01 – 0. 5 mg kg− 1 i. v.) abolished the recurrent {{inhibition of}} both the C fibre and Aδ bladder reflexes, while inhibition from afferents in the dorsal clitoris nerve remained unchanged. It is concluded that the segmental bladder C fibre reflex and the spino-ponto-spinal Aδ micturition reflex are both targets of recurrent inhibition from bladder parasympathetic preganglionic neurones and that the effect involves an enkephalinergic mechanism...|$|R

Results Each of the VAPs inhibited cell growth, but the extent of this inhibition differed with the preparation and with the cell line. The concentrations of VAP-Qu, VAP-M and VAP-A which led to a 50 % reduction of cell growth (IC 50) varied between 0. 6 and 0. 03 mg/ml. Higher concentrations of VAP-P were required to obtain a comparable effect. Purified mistletoe lectin I (MLI) led to an inhibition of breast carcinoma cell growth at concentrations lower than those of VAPs, but the sensitivity towards purified MLI did not parallel that towards VAPs. Bladder carcinoma cells were in most cases more sensitive to VAPs treatment than breast carcinoma cells. The total mistletoe lectin content was very high in VAP-Qu (54 ng/mg extract), intermediate in VAP-M (25 ng/mg extract), and very low in VAP-P (1. 3 ng/mg extract) and in VAP-A (1 ng/mg extract). As to be expected from the low content of mistletoe lectin, VAP-P led to relatively weak cytotoxic effects. Most remarkably, however, the lectin-poor VAP-A revealed a cytotoxic effect comparable to, or even stronger than, that of the lectin-rich VAP-Qu, on all <b>tested</b> <b>bladder</b> and breast carcinoma cell lines. Conclusion The results suggest the existence of cytotoxic components other than mistletoe lectin in VAP-A and reveal an unexpected potential of this preparation for the treatment of breast and bladder cancer. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Urinary continence is an {{important}} outcome parameter after robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). We evaluated the continence outcomes following RARP using a double-layered urethrovesical reconstruction. Materials and Methods: One hundred fifty consecutive patients undergoing RARP and double-layered urethrovesical reconstruction were prospectively studied for preoperative, intraoperative and post operative parameters. Key points followed during surgery were: Minimal dissection of sphincteric complex, preservation of puboprostatic ligament, selective ligation of deep venous complex and both posterior and anterior reconstruction using the Von Velthoven stitch. Intraoperative <b>bladder</b> fill <b>test</b> was done {{at the end of}} anastomosis to rule out urine leak. Check cystogram was done prior to catheter removal in the outpatient department. Patients were subsequently followed at regular intervals regarding the status of urinary continence. All patients irrespective of adjuvant therapy were included in the analysis. Results: The mean age was 64 years (standard deviation ± 6. 88), and mean serum PSA was 20. 2 ng/ml. The mean BMI was 25. 6 (SD: ± 3. 84). The mean prostate weight was 44. 09 gm (range 18 - 103 gm, SD: ± 15. 59). Median days to catheter removal after surgery was 7 (range 4 - 14 days) days. Cystographically determined urinary leaks were seen in two patients. Urine leak was managed by delaying catheter removal for 1 week. Minimum 6 month follow up was available in 126 patients. ′No pad′ status at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year was 15. 1 %, 54. 9 %, 78 %, 90. 5 % and 94. 1 %, respectively. Conclusion: Excellent continence outcomes are observed in patients undergoing double-layered urethrovesical reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Bladder cancer can {{be viewed}} as a {{prototype}} for carcinogen-induced neoplasia. This has been demon-strated experimentally in a variety of systems and in man through epidemiological studies of occupational exposure to putative carcinogens. The natural history of this neoplasm demonstrates recurrence in time and space, i. e., multifocal disease. This clinical scenario is precisely what would be expected if a target tissue, e. g., urothelium, was continuously exposed to a weak carcinogen. The detection of gross disease is clinically easy. However, the ability to intervene at early stages and monitor the success of this treatment requires the definition of early markers for bladder cancer. lntegrins are a family of cell surface proteins, many of which function as receptors for extracellular matrix components. Normal epithelial cells express the integrin a 6 P 4 in association with an anchoring structure known as the hemidesmosome. Urothelium expresses a 6 P 4 on the basal layer of cells similar to the distribution seen on other epithelial surfaces. Even early stages of bladder cancer demonstrate an alteration in the expression of this integrin. Low-stage bladdertumors express asp 4 diffusely throughout the tumor as well as at the invading margin. Altered expression of a 6 P 4 may be an early marker for bladder cancer which may contribute to an invasive phenotype. A second potential marker is detected by DD 23, an lgGl murine monoclonal antibody triggered by the immunization of a BALBk mousewith afresh human bladdertumor specimen. The antigen detected by DD 23 is not present on normal urothelial specimens. It is expressed on 81 %of <b>bladder</b> tumors <b>tested</b> and is present on both low-grade, non-invasive and high-grade...|$|R
