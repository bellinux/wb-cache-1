50|$|Propene is {{the second}} most {{important}} starting product in the petrochemical industry after ethylene. It is the raw material {{for a wide variety of}} products. Manufacturers of the plastic polypropylene account for nearly two thirds of all demand. Polypropylene end uses include films, fibers, containers, packaging, and caps and closures. Propene is also used for the production of important chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, cumene, <b>butyraldehyde,</b> and acrylic acid. In the year 2013 about 85 million tonnes of propene were processed worldwide.|$|E
50|$|The Union Carbide (UCC) process, {{also known}} as {{low-pressure}} oxo process (LPO), relies on a rhodium catalyst dissolved in high-boiling thick oil, a higher molecular weight condensation product of the primary aldehydes, for the hydroformylation of propene. The reaction mixture is separated in a falling film evaporator from volatile components. The liquid phase is distilled and <b>butyraldehyde</b> is removed as head product while the catalyst containing bottom product is recycled to the process. The process is carried out at about 1.8 MPa and 95-100 °C.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1950s, most butanol in the United States is {{produced}} commercially from fossil fuels. The most common process starts with propene (propylene), which is put through a hydroformylation reaction to form <b>butyraldehyde,</b> {{which is then}} reduced with hydrogen to 1-butanol and/or 2-butanol. Tert-butanol is derived from isobutane as a co-product of propylene oxide production. Butanol can also be produced by fermentation of biomass by bacteria. Prior to the 1950s, Clostridium acetobutylicum was used in industrial fermentation to produce butanol.

50|$|The {{process is}} carried out in a stirred tank reactor where the olefin and the syngas are bubbled {{from the bottom of}} the reactor through the {{catalyst}} phase under intensive stirring. The resulting crude aldehyde phase is separated at the top from the aqueous phase. The aqueous catalyst-containing solution is re-heated via a heat exchanger and pumped back into the reactor. The excess olefin and syngas is separated from the aldehyde phase in a stripper and fed back to the reactor. The generated heat is used for the generation of process steam, which is used for subsequent distillation of the organic phase to separate into <b>butyraldehyde</b> and isobutyraldehyde. Potential catalyst poisons coming from the synthesis gas migrate into the organic phase and removed from the reaction with the aldehyde. Thus there is no accumulation of catalyst poisons, and the elaborate fine purification of the syngas can be omitted.|$|E
50|$|The Ruhrchemie/Rhone-Poulenc process (RCRPP) {{relies on}} a rhodium {{catalyst}} with water-soluble TPPTS as ligand (Kuntz Cornils catalyst) for the hydroformylation of propene. The tri-sulfonation of triphenylphosphane ligand provides hydrophilic properties to the organometallic complex. The catalyst complex carries nine sulfonate-groups and is highly soluble in water (about 1 kg L−1), {{but not in the}} emerging product phase. The water-soluble TPPTS is used in about 50-fold excess, whereby the leaching of the catalyst is effectively suppressed. Reactants are propene and syngas consisting of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in a ratio of 1.1:1. A mixture of <b>butyraldehyde</b> and isobutyraldehyde in the ratio 96:4 is generated with few by-products such as alcohols, esters and higher boiling fractions. The Ruhrchemie/Rhone-Poulenc-process is the first commercially available two-phase system in which the catalyst is present in the aqueous phase. In the progress of the reaction an organic product phase is formed which is separated continuously by means of phase separation, wherein the aqueous catalyst phase remains in the reactor.|$|E

50|$|When {{considering}} the emissions from fossil fuel and biofuel use, research typically focuses on major pollutants such as hydrocarbons. It is generally recognized that using biodiesel {{in place of}} diesel results in a substantial reduction in regulated gas emissions, {{but there has been}} a lack of information in research literature about the non-regulated compounds which also play a role in air pollution. One study focused on the emissions of non-criteria carbonyl compounds from the burning of pure diesel and biodiesel blends in heavy-duty diesel engines. The results found that carbonyl emissions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, acetone, propionaldehyde and <b>butyraldehyde,</b> were higher in biodiesel mixtures than emissions from pure diesel. Biodiesel use results in higher carbonyl emissions but lower total hydrocarbon emissions, which may be better as an alternative fuel source. Other studies have been done which conflict with these results, but comparisons are difficult to make due to various factors that differ between studies (such as types of fuel and engines used). In a paper which compared 12 research articles on carbonyl emissions from biodiesel fuel use, it found that 8 of the papers reported increased carbonyl compound emissions while 4 showed the opposite. This is evidence that there is still much research required on these compounds.|$|E
50|$|The {{research}} group then identified enzymes that utilize NADPH or both NADPH and NADH by bioprospecting. Acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB) {{was found to}} be a suitable replacement for hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase (Hbd). To replace AdhE2, the researchers found that NADP-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (YqhD) from E. coli to be effective for the pathway. Furthermore, the researchers needed a dehydrogenase to replace the aldehyde dehydrogenase capacity of AdhE2. CoA-acylating <b>butyraldehyde</b> dehydrogenase (Bldh) from C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum {{was found to be}} a good suit. Together, PhaB, Bldh, YqhD can replace Hbd and AdhE2, respectively, to change the cofactor preference of 3-ketobutyryl-CoA reduction from using NADH to using NADPH. The authors then constructed various combinations of the different enzymes (of those found in the reverse oxidation pathway and the NADPH utilizing enzymes) by overexpressing different genes in cultures of S. elongatus PCC 7942. In order to do so, they constructed plasmids containing the genes corresponding to the enzymes and combined them into the genome of S. elongates. After enzyme assays, the strain of cyanobacteria expressing the NADPH utilizing enzymes produced the greatest amount of 1-butanol (29.9 mg/L), exceeding that of strains that did not consist of the NADPH utilizing enzymes by four times. Overall, 1-butanol was produced in S. elongatus using a pathway from another organism. This pathway was modified in order to match the preferred reducing cofactor for the cyanobacteria.|$|E
40|$|The hydroformylation of {{propylene}} to <b>butyraldehyde</b> is {{an important}} industrial process. In this reaction system, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and propylene are converted to n-butyraldehyde in an aqueous phase containing a water-soluble rhodium catalyst. This reaction system consists therefore of three different phases: the aqueous catalyst phase, the organic <b>butyraldehyde</b> phase, and the gas phase. A modeling study indicated that an optimum value of the production rate is reached at a certain power input. It was shown that mass transfer {{plays an important role}} in this reaction system and that accurate knowledge of the mass-transfer parameters in the gas-liquid-liquid system is necessary to predict and to optimize the production rate. Mass-transfer experiments with CO, H 2, and propylene in water and in solutions consisting of water with different amounts of n-butyraldehyde were carried out in a stirred autoclave. The results indicated that the addition of small amounts of <b>butyraldehyde</b> caused a relatively small increase in kLa, which was probably caused by a larger increase of the gas-liquid interfacial area, a, accompanied by a decrease in the mass-transfer coefficient, kL. Near the point of maximum solubility of <b>butyraldehyde,</b> a strong (factor of 3) increase in kLa was observed. The most logical explanation for this is an increase in kL, because measurement of the interfacial area did not show such an increase. This increase in kL, i. e., the disappearance of the initial decrease, might be due to the disappearance of the rigid layer of <b>butyraldehyde</b> molecules at the gas-liquid interface by formation and spreading of a <b>butyraldehyde</b> layer around the bubble. ...|$|E

Coke deposits on the spent catalyst samples were characterized using temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) and CHNS+O elemental analysis. Catalyst performance, i. e., conversion, product distribution and short term stability, as well as coke deposit characterization, were utilized to develop reaction networks for 1 -butene, <b>butyraldehyde</b> and butanol. At 500 °C the individual reforming rates of the three components decrease in the order butyraldehyde>butanol> 1 -butene and the initial reaction rates of butanol decrease in the order dehydration>dehydrogenation>direct reforming. The three main pathways, i. e., direct reforming of butanol and reforming via butane and <b>butyraldehyde</b> respectively, contributed roughly equally to the butanol reforming activity of the catalyst at 500 °C. At 700 °C, complete conversion was observed for all components, with hydrogen yields 70 % of theoretical maximum for butanol and 1 -butene and 60 % for <b>butyraldehyde.</b> Deactivation of the catalyst for reforming is caused by carbon deposition on and near the Rh particles.
