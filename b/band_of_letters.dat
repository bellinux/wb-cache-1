The Netherlands also showed a great liking for hammered work, and produced {{a large number of}} lecterns, altar candlesticks and the like in that method. The large dishes embossed with Adam and Eve and similar subjects are probably of Dutch origin, and found in neighbouring countries. These differ considerably from the brass dishes in which the central subject —- the Annunciation, St George, St Christopher, the Agnus Dei, a mermaid or flowers — is surrounded by a <b>band</b> <b>of</b> <b>letters,</b> which frequently have no significance beyond that of ornamentation; the rims are stamped with a repeating pattern of small designs. This latter type of dish was probably the work of Nuremberg or Augsburg craftsmen, and it should be noticed that the whole of the ornament is produced by hammering into dies or by use of stamps; they are purely mechanical pieces.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} known for some time that both foveal and {{peripheral}} visual acuity is higher for single letters than for letters in a row. Early work showed that this was due to the destructive interaction of adjacent contours (termed ‘crowding’ or contour interaction). It has been assumed to have a neural basis and a number of competing explanations have been advanced which implicate either high-level or low-level stages of visual processing. Our results suggest a much simpler explanation, one primarily determined by the physics of the stimulus rather than the physiology of the visual system. We show that, under conditions of contour interaction or ‘crowding’, the most relevant physical spatial frequency <b>band</b> <b>of</b> the <b>letter</b> is displaced to higher spatial frequencies and that foveal vision tracks this change in spatial scale...|$|R

It was a small, self-funded and self-selecting learned society, which met on a bi-monthly basis to present and discuss medical and scientific papers on new and improving subjects. This article examines the society and its connection to an Enlightenment and a cosmopolitan Republic <b>of</b> <b>Letters.</b> It investigates the society?s inauguration, membership, ideology and aims and considers how information was collected, produced and disseminated by its members.

40|$|The issue {{addressed}} {{in this study is}} whether there are differential effects <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> on word and nonword naming latency. Experiment 1 examined the effect <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> on latency for naming high-frequency words, low-frequency words, and nonwords. Number <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> affected latency for low-frequency words and nonwords but did not affect latency for high-frequency words. Number <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> was also negatively correlated with number of orthographic neighbours, number of friends, and average grapheme frequency. Number <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> continued to affect nonword naming latency, but not low-frequency word naming latency, after the effects of orthographic neighbourhood size, number of friends, and average grapheme frequency had been accounted for. Experiment 2 found that number <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> had no effect on the latency of delayed naming of the same words and nonwords. It is concluded that the effect <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> on nonword naming reflects a sequential, non-lexical reading mechanism. © 1997 The Experimental Psychology Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|According to Gibson (1962) {{fixation}} on key features <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> {{has a major}} role in the development of emergent literacy. But it was still unknown which role key features <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> had on children who can’t read or write conventional. The following hypotheses where tested in this research: ‘Do 4 -year old children fixate more on key features <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> than 3 -year old children?’, ‘Do 4 -year old children fixate longer on key features <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> than 3 -year old children?’, ‘Mediates letter knowledge the relation number of fixations on key features <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> and emergent writing?’ and ‘Mediates letter knowledge the relation fixation time on key features <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> and emergent writing?’ In this research 75 4 -year old and 104 3 -year old children participated. The Tobii eye tracker x 2 - 60 recorded the fixation count and duration on key features <b>of</b> <b>letters.</b> Besides using the eye tracker device, a letter knowledge task has been taken. At the same time a test was taken to determine the stage of emergent writing. The first task <b>of</b> the <b>letter</b> perception test was not significant (P >. 05). But there was a significant difference between the 3 - and 4 -year old and the second task fixation count on key features <b>of</b> <b>letters,</b> t (171) = - 2. 05, p =. 042. A significant difference between the 3 - and 4 -year old was shown on the second task fixation duration on key features <b>of</b> <b>letters,</b> t (171) = - 2. 83, p =. 005. Additionally can be concluded that letter knowledge (p <. 01) mediates significant between the first and second task fixation duration and the first and second task fixation count on key features <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> and emergent writing. Concluding, from the early childhood letter {{fixation on}} key features <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> has influence on the further development of emergent literacy...|$|R
