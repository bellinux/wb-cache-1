50|$|Work on flue {{installation}} by Fraser Shipyards began November 17, 2015, and {{was completed}} on December 26, 2015. The 28's wheels were given clearance by the FRA {{a few months}} later. In March 2016, the brass and cab water-level meters were reinstalled, the super-heater tubes were being reassembled for installation, and the blow-down valves were sent to Colorado for rebuilding. The hydro-test was scheduled for July 13, 2016. The FRA report was filed on July 20, 2016, stating the locomotive passed the test. The cab was painted black with red windows in June. The smoke box front was being installed in early August. Insulation and lagging and a new <b>boiler</b> <b>jacket</b> were supplied to the museum to finish locomotive assembly at no charge. Insulation was installed on the boiler beginning August 12, according to the North Shore Scenic Railroad's Facebook page.|$|E

50|$|Paper demand {{declined}} {{through the}} Great Depression until pulpwood transfer ceased in 1933 after the railroad had carried {{nearly a million}} cords of pulpwood. The Plymouth switchers found work elsewhere while the steam locomotives waited in the engine house for improved economic conditions. Great Northern found trucks more cost effective than restoring the railroad when business returned following World War II. The trestle gradually collapsed into Chamberlain Lake, but Maine Forest Service employees continued using a motor vehicle over the two miles of track between Eagle Lake and Chamberlain Lake. The engine house became a popular snowmobile destination in the 1960s; and fittings like gauges, bells, headlights, and number plates began to disappear from the locomotives before the wooden cab of engine #1 was destroyed when the engine house burned in 1969. The locomotive <b>boiler</b> <b>jackets</b> and asbestos lagging were removed in 1995 but the stripped locomotive shells remain a unique reminder of the industrial revolution in the Maine North Woods.|$|R
5000|$|In 1877, the new Chief Mechanical Engineer of the NZR, Allison D. Smith {{required}} {{some new}} motive {{power for the}} fledgling Government system. It had been intended to order more J Class locomotives which were of an English design. However, Mr Smith was adamant American locomotives {{would be much more}} suitable for New Zealand's conditions. His argument won, and an order was placed with the Rogers Locomotive Works of New Jersey, for two tender locomotives with a wheel arrangement of 2-4-2. Upon their arrival to New Zealand, the locomotives created quite a stir with their bar frames, 'Gothic' style wooden cabs, locomotive bell, ornate embellishments and, rakish appearances which were at odds with the traditional English locomotive appearance in New Zealand at the time and were described by one commentator as [...] "a watch with all its works outside". [...] In addition this first pair, K 87 [...] "Lincoln" [...] and K 88 [...] "Washington", reputedly wore a 'kaleidoscope' of colours - green, blue, yellow, red, purple, and gold in addition to their Russian Iron <b>boiler</b> <b>jackets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Number 119 is {{the less}} {{powerful}} of the zoo's two locomotives and regularly hauls a train of five open-air coaches. This engine {{is known for}} its colorful paint scheme, polished brass, and sweet-sounding Nathan six chime whistle. No. 119 was the original locomotive on the Omaha Zoo Railroad and was custom built for the zoo in 1968. It was built by Crown Metal Products of Wyano, Pennsylvania, a company that built replica steam trains for amusement parks and zoos all over the country. In honor of zoo railroad benefactor Union Pacific, the engine was decorated to resemble the Union Pacific's ceremonial engine used at the 1869 completion of the first transcontinental railroad. It is a 4-4-0 type locomotive, meaning that it has four pilot wheels to help guide it through curves, 4 large driving wheels, and no trailing wheels. This type of locomotive was prevalent on American railroads from 1850 to about 1880, thus earning it the nickname [...] "American standard". During the 119's first years at the zoo, it was underpowered and had difficulty pulling the train up the steep hills. Subsequent modifications by the Union Pacific and the zoo railroad's own shop have improved it greatly, and after a major rebuild in 1996-1999, it was deemed to be in better-than-new condition. During the rebuild, the engine also received a cosmetic makeover. Originally painted black, white, and red, it emerged resplendent in a beautiful and historically accurate scheme of crimson, maroon, and olive green with a <b>boiler</b> <b>jacket</b> of simulated Russia iron. A new stained wood cab replicating the one on the original UP locomotive was also fitted. This engine returned to service in May 2013 after an overhaul.|$|E
40|$|If {{all goes}} well we will have another chance to welcome the "Royal Hudson " from Vancou ver, B. C. during May. Its history goes back to 1937 when Canadian Pacific decided to start {{replacing}} their older locomo tives, most {{of which had been}} built from the 19 10 's through the ' 20 's. All orders during the Depression were set aside due to lack of funds. The favorite model was the stream lined 4 - 6 - 4 Hudson built by the Montreal Locomotive Works. They were just the right size and weight to be used over the whole system, coast to coast. Though intended for passenger trains, they were used ex tensively during World War II for pulling high-priority freight trains as well. With 75 -inch drivers they could easily travel at over 100 miles per hour. One hit an unofficial 112 mph on its wide open notch 8 throttle test. In the spring of 1939 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth ac cepted the offer of an elaborate rail way tour over both the Canadian Pacific and the Canadian National. A special Royal Train was made up, repainted in blue and silver. To head this showpiece H Id 4 - 6 - 4 # 2850 was selected, repainted to match the train, and fitted with a stainless steel <b>boiler</b> <b>jacket.</b> Royal crests adorned the smokebox front and the sides of th...|$|E

5000|$|The firm {{exhibited}} their Patent Agricultural Locomotive Engine for Threshing, Ploughing and General Traction Purposes at Battersea in 1862. Aveling {{moved the}} cylinder forward from over the firebox {{to the front}} of the <b>boiler.</b> The steam <b>jacket</b> that surrounds the cylinders did away with the need for a separate dome (the patent stated that the cylinders were placed within the dome). [...] The jacket reduced condensation, and hence priming, in the cylinders, valve gear and now non-existent supply piping. Ports between the <b>jacket</b> and <b>boiler</b> communicated live steam. The crankshaft was now close to the wheels and the long chain could be first shortened, then disposed of in favour of gears. In 1863 Aveling patented two-speed gearing. [...] Exports at this period were to Prussia and Australia.|$|R
40|$|Biomass boiler application, {{despite its}} many advantages, is {{dependent}} upon many technical aspects, which require tests and optimization. Because of practical constraints, {{one of the most}} problematic areas of research is the analysis of phenomena occurring inside the water <b>jacket</b> of the <b>boiler</b> during the combustion process. The issue referred to above is significant due to its direct impact on the heating up of the operating medium for current power of the device and the total efficiency. The paper presents the analytical possibilities of the operating medium in a biomass <b>boiler</b> water <b>jacket.</b> The experimental works conducted {{as a part of the}} study were performed using an actual device – EKOPAL RM 40 straw boiler. They were aimed at defining the values of significant boundary conditions. Resistance thermometers and K-type thermocouples connected to a data acquisition system were placed in selected points of the water jacket and the combustion chambers to allow the monitoring of the conditions of the water heating process during biomass combustion. A measurement of inlet water mass flow rate was performed. To develop a numerical model of heat transfer into the water jacket, ANSYS CFX software was applied. The results of the experiments and simulations were compared and discussed. The paper describes the methodology and instruments used to perform the experimental studies, as well as some optimization solutions developed based on the results of the numeric alanalysis...|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s a new {{generation}} of menswear boutiques sprang up, aiming to change the decor, rituals, and customer base of a traditionally 'difficult' trade. To sell fashionable clothes to a young man {{at the end of the}} 1960s was still, in many circles, tantamount to questioning his masculinity. Men's appearance changed more in the 1970s than it had done in a whole century. Many of the fashion designers who revolutionized the male look owed a lot of their innovations to Pierre Cardin: narrow shoulders, tight-fitting lines, no tie, no interfacing, zip-up <b>boiler</b> suits, waisted <b>jackets</b> or tunics, sometimes no shirt. Work clothes supplied inspiration for a less formal style, encouraging designers to look beyond the traditional suit and, for example, adopt a unisex look or investigate the massive supply of second-hand clothes. Sometimes this kind of male dressing-down, often denounced as 'hippie', gained formal recognition as a deliberate look. At certain other times, as part of a retro movement, designers introduced a revival of 1930s elegance. The unearthing of old military clothing, preferably khaki and from the United States; English-style shoes; Oxford shirts; immaculate T-shirts; tweed jackets with padded shoulders; brightly colored V-neck sweaters; cashmere-printed scarves draped around the neck all imposed a certain uniformity on the casual beatnik look of the male wardrobe at the end of the 1970s.|$|R
40|$|European Union has {{recently}} {{made a new}} directive to impose a classification system based on boilers efficiency. This new regulation generates the necessity of create new boilers more energy efficient like the one developed throughout this thesis. An innovative {{combined heat and power}} boiler (CHP boiler) called Boiler Booster is studied in this thesis. The main focus will therefore be to design the Boiler Booster taking the advantage of using the patented absorption technology developed by ClimateWell AS. Natural Gas is burned in the <b>jacket</b> <b>boiler</b> in order to use exhaust gases to heat up the water circuit from the heating system. The heat exchanger design integrates two identical tubes with eight small ClimateWell tubes in each, which transfer heat with exhaust gases. The purpose of the thesis is to design the Boiler Booster, an enhancement of current CHP boilers, which are able to deliver more power to the heating system. This is possible by extracting the maximum power from the exhaust gases and hence, lowering their final temperature as well as generating condensation of the water inside them. The optimal Boiler Booster size, the tubes shape and the use of fins along them to enhance the convective heat transfer are studied with the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) program. Finally, results of different designs are studied to end up with the best Boiler Booster design...|$|R
