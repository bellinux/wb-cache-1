Yet, in spite of this importance, reliable methods to measure interfacial properties between dissimilar materials remain elusive. Here we present an experimental approach to quantify the interfacial fracture energy Œì[subscript i] that also provides unique mechanistic insight into the interfacial debonding mechanism at the nanoscale. This approach involves deposition of an additional chromium layer (superlayer) onto a <b>bonded</b> <b>system,</b> where interface debonding is initiated by the residual tensile stress in the superlayer, and where the interface can be separated in a controlled manner and captured in situ. Contrary to earlier methods, our approach allows the entire <b>bonded</b> <b>system</b> to remain in an elastic range during the debonding process, such that Œì[subscript i] can be measured accurately. We validate the method by showing that moisture has a degrading effect on the bonding between epoxy and silica, a technologically important interface. Combining in situ through scanning electron microscope images with molecular simulation, we find that the interfacial debonding mechanism is hierarchical in nature, which is initiated by the detachment of polymer chains, and that the three-dimensional covalent network of the epoxy-based polymer may directly influence water accumulation, leading to the reduction of Œì[subscript i] under presence of moisture.

40|$|Fibre-reinforced-polymer (FRP) {{composites}} {{have been}} widely used for the flexural strengthening of reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Flexural strengthening methods with FRP include external bonding of FRP composites (EB system) and insertion of FRP strips or bars into grooves cut into the concrete (near-surface-mounted or NSM system). Recently, a prestressed FRP strengthening system has been developed and investigated, whereby the FRP reinforcement is pretensioned prior to attachment to the concrete to maximize the use of the high tensile strength of the FRP reinforcement. Existing {{studies have shown that the}} ultimate load carrying capacity and serviceability were greatly improved in FRP flexural strengthened beams. However, the only disadvantage of the FRP strengthening system is the reduction of deformability compared to that of unstrengthened structures due to the limited strain capacity of the FRP reinforcement and premature debonding failure. Structures with low deformability may fail suddenly without warning to evacuate, resulting in catastrophic failure. Therefore, a study on the improvement of deformability is critical for the effective use of FRP strengthening systems. In this study, a partially bonded concept is introduced and applied to various FRP strengthening methods, with the specific objective of increasing deformability in FRP strengthened beams. The FRP reinforcement is usually completely bonded to the concrete tensile surface, while a portion of the FRP length is intentionally unbonded in the partially <b>bonded</b> <b>system</b> in order to improve deformability while sustaining high load carrying capacity. To investigate the general behaviour of the partially <b>bonded</b> <b>system,</b> a new analytical model has been developed because conventional section analysis used for analysis of the fully <b>bonded</b> <b>system</b> is not applicable due to strain incompatibility at the FRP reinforcement level within the unbonded length. The analysis shows that a partially <b>bonded</b> <b>system</b> has a high potential to improve deformability without the loss of strength capacity. An extensive experimental program was conducted to verify the analytical model and to investigate the actual behaviour of the partially bonded beams. A total of seventeen, 3. 5 m long, RC T-beams were constructed and tested. One of them is an unstrengthened control beam, while the other 16 beams consist of four test groups that were strengthened by different strengthening methods: non-prestressed EB, non-prestressed NSM, 40 % prestressed NSM, and 60 % prestressed NSM. To allow investigation of the effect of partially unbonding, each group has different unbonded lengths and includes a fully bonded beam. For the non-prestressed EB strengthened beams, the failure mode of all beams was premature FRP debonding failure without regard to the bond condition. The ultimate strength and the ultimate deformability of the partially bonded beams were improved compared to the fully bonded beam. This was because the typical intermediate debonding failure that occurred in the fully bonded beam was avoided due to intentional unbonding in the partially bonded beams. The analytical model predicted the general behaviour of the EB strengthened beams well except at the ultimate response due to the premature debonding failure. A three-dimensional nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis was performed utilizing interfacial elements and contact modeling to investigate the debonding failure of this system. The FE analysis represented the behaviour of the debonding failure and bond stress distributions at FRP-concrete interface of both the fully bonded and partially bonded beams well. For the non-prestressed NSM strengthened beams, the premature debonding failure that occurred in the EB strengthened beams was not observed, and almost the full capacity of FRP was exhibited. Prominent stiffness reduction was observed in terms of load-deflection diagrams at the post-yielding stage with the increase of the unbonded length. This stiffness reduction increased the deformability of the partially bonded beams for a given applied load after steel yielding in comparison to the fully bonded beam. The FRP started to slip at high load levels and the concrete crushed gradually with a gradual loss of the beam‚Äôs cross-section, inducing nonlinear behaviour near the ultimate state of the beams. To address this behaviour, an advanced analytical model utilizing idealized section model and slip model is proposed to consider the FRP slip and concrete gradual failure. Prestressed NSM strengthened beams were very effective to improve the cracking load, to decrease the deflection at service load, and to increase the ultimate load compared to non-prestressed NSM strengthened beams. This improvement was greater as the prestressing level increased. The partially bonded prestressed beams showed an improvement in deformability compared to the fully bonded prestressed beams while minimizing the reduction of the ultimate load carrying capacity and serviceability. The partially <b>bonded</b> <b>system</b> was more effective to improve the deformability at higher levels of prestressing force. Based on the model developed, a parametric study was performed varying the main parameters. This showed that the FRP strengthened beam that has an FRP area (Af) less than the balanced FRP area (Af,b) of the beam has a high potential to improve the deformability as the unbonded length increases. The balanced FRP area is increased as the concrete strength and the FRP prestressing force are increased, or as the area of the steel reinforcement decreases. Finally, design recommendations and procedures are proposed for the effective use of the partially <b>bonded</b> <b>system</b> to improve the deformability of FRP strengthened concrete beams...|$|E

40|$|Bi-layer {{material}} {{systems are}} found in various engineering applications ranging from nano-scale components, such as thin films in circuit boards, to macro-scale structures such as adhesive bonding in aerospace and civil infrastructure applications. They are also found in many natural and biological materials such as nacre or bone. One of the most human-related applications of bi-layer material systems is the artificial tooth involving the bonding between the natural tooth and the metal cap glued with a polymer based material. The structural integrity of a bi-layer system depends on properties of both the interface and the constitutive materials. In particular, interfacial delamination has been observed as a major integrity issue. In this research, a comprehensive investigation on the interfacial debonding mechanism has been conducted both computationally and experimentally using an epoxy-silica system. In the computational approach, a multiscale model which can predict the intrinsic strength between organic and inorganic materials, based on a molecular dynamics simulation approach, is presented. The intrinsic strength between epoxy and silica derived from the molecular level {{can be used to}} predict the structural behavior of epoxy-silica interface at the macroscopic length-scale by invoking a finite element approach using a cohesive zone model developed in this research. In order to understand the moisture effect in a more comprehensive way, the free energy profile of the epoxy-silica <b>bonded</b> <b>system</b> describing the debonding process has been reconstructed for both dry and wet conditions and it is found that the adhesion between epoxy and silica, which is dominated by the van der Waals force and Coulombic interaction, can be weakened significantly (more than 68 % reduction) in the presence of water. Experimental work involving two different approaches, namely "nanoindentation" and "superlayer" approaches, in characterizing the interfacial fracture toughness are presented and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these two approaches are discussed. The morphology of material in the vicinity of the interface has also been captured using the scanning electronic microscope (SEM). Experimental results show that the interface fracture energy decreases significantly after 4 weeks of moisture conditioning. Both the experimental and computational results show that water plays a main role in the interfacial deterioration. The mechanism of interfacial deterioration is explained using molecular dynamics simulation and a multiscale model of the epoxy-silica <b>bonded</b> <b>system</b> which is capable of predicting the macro-scale structural behavior based on the reconstructed free energy profile of the <b>bonded</b> <b>system</b> at the nano-scale. The multiscale modeling used in this research provides a powerful new approach to link nano-level to macro-level for complex material behavior. by Tak Bun Denvid Lau. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|A {{combined}} experimental-analytical {{investigation to}} characterize the cyclic failure mechanism of a simple composite-to-composite bonded joint is conducted. The cracked lap shear (CLS) specimens of graphite/epoxy adherend bonded with EC- 3445 adhesive are tested under combined mode 1 and 2 loading. In all specimens tested, fatigue failure occurs {{in the form of}} cyclic debonding. The cyclic debond growth rates are measured. The finite element analysis is employed to compute the mode 1, mode 2, and total strain energy release rates (i. e., GI, GII, and GT). A wide range of mixed-mode loading, i. e., GI/GII ranging from 0. 03 to 0. 38, is obtained. The total strain energy release rate, G sub T, appeared to be the driving parameter for cyclic debonding in the tested composite <b>bonded</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{comparisons}} in {{this paper}} show that the United States has a more mature and unified reclamation <b>bonding</b> <b>system</b> than the other three countries. Although controversies and problems still exist where companies do not secure enough bonds, do not update their liabilities during mining process, the system in the United States has been highly successful in helping companies be responsible for reclamation liabilities. More than 80 % of the land disturbed since 1977 has been reclaimed. As a country that implemented mine reclamation <b>bonding</b> <b>system</b> only recently, China can adopt laws and regulations that clearly work well {{from the experience of}} other countries and improve many aspects of the reclamation <b>bonding</b> <b>system</b> including the passage of a national law and regulations, creating a national administrative authority, expanding bond types, unifying bond calculation methods to determine the size of bonds, establishing bond release criteria, and allowing for full public participation in the reclamation system.
