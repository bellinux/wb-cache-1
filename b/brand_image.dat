25|$|The fast-fashion brands are not {{the only}} one who involve with sweat factories. The German {{sportswear}} giant, Adidas, was blamed for Indonesian sweatshops in 2000 (Osborn, 2000). Adidas was subjected to the issues of underpayment, overtime working, physical abuse and child labour. Another sportswear giant, Nike, is recently facing a heavy wave of anti-sweatshops protests in the US. They are organised by the United Student Against Sweatshops (USAS) and were held in Boston, Washington D.C., Bangalore and San Pedro Sula. They claimed that workers in Nike’s contract factory in Vietnam are suffering from wage theft, verbal abuse and harsh working conditions with ‘temperatures over the legal limit of 90 degrees’(Bain, 2017). Since the 1990s, Nike was reported of employing sweat factories and child labour. Regardless of its effort to turn things around, Nike’s image has been affected by the issue during the past two decades. Nike established an independent department which aimed to improve workers’ life in 1996. It was renamed as Fair Labor Association in 1999 and is a non-profit organisation which includes representatives from companies, human right and labour unions to work on monitoring and management of labour rights (Nisen, 2013). To improve its <b>brand</b> <b>image</b> of being immoral, Nike has been publishing annual sustainable business reports since 2001(Project Just, 2016) and annual corporate social responsibility report continuously since 2005, mentioning its commitments, standards and audit (Nisen, 2013).Yet, the issue of sweatshops continues to bother Nike. Similar stories are still heard in the fashion industry in the past decades.|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} for islands to discover their genuine competencies and capabilities {{in order to find}} their place in an evolving global economy. Economic self‐discovery, however, is difficult because exploitative mechanisms (investing in old ideas) tend to naturally dominate economic behaviour when compared to exploration mechanisms (investing in new ideas). In this paper, a brand diagnostic tool is used to distinguish islands with unique <b>brand</b> <b>images</b> from islands with relatively common <b>brand</b> <b>images.</b> Through a simulation of the mutual learning processes within the social networks of these islands, this paper shows that economic self‐discovery is facilitated in islands with strong and unique branding strategy, as a strong holistic brand frame exploration activities by reducing ambiguity and confusion. Islands with common <b>brand</b> <b>images</b> fail to strengthen their brands because of the predominance of exploitative mechanisms in their economies and as a result enter a vicious circle where increasing brand dilution and confusion blocks the exploration and discovery of new ideas...|$|R
