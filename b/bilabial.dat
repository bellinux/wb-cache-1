Vovels following the stops influence the tri more in careful than in spontaneous speech, which can also be explained by the experimentally confirmed phenomenon of the ehanging quality of the present-dav Hungarian vowels into the neutral vowel.

40|$|Abstract In speaker {{identification}} by listening, {{the identification}} rates {{vary depending on}} the speech contents presented to the subjects. It is reported that the nasals are more effective than the oral sounds for identifying speakers. The present study investigates the availability of the nasal sounds in terms of syllable structures.

As to the place of articulation, alveolar consonants in onset positions were more effective than <b>bilabials,</b> and the nasals were better than their oral counterparts were...|$|R

25|$|Different {{whistling}} styles {{may be used}} in {{a single}} language. Sochiapam Chinantec has three different words for whistle-speech: sie3 for whistling with the tongue against the alveolar ridge, jui̵32 for <b>bilabial</b> whistling, and juo2 for finger-in-the-mouth whistling. These are used for communication over varying distances. There is also a kind of loud falsetto (hóh32) which functions in some ways like whistled speech.|$|E
25|$|Warndarang has a {{consonant}} inventory {{similar to}} that of many Australian languages. There are five main places of articulation – <b>bilabial,</b> apico-alveolar, retroflex, lamino-alveolar, and velar – with a stop and a nasal in each, {{with the addition of a}} rarely used interdental stop. There are also two laterals, two rhotics, and two semi-vowels. The presence of a glottal stop is debatable; the glottal stops that Heath heard were unstable and appeared to be optional.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the lack}} of fricatives, the most {{striking}} feature of Australian speech sounds is {{the large number of}} places of articulation. Nearly every language has four places in the coronal region, either phonemically or allophonically. This is accomplished through two variables: the position of the tongue (front or back), and its shape (pointed or flat). There are also <b>bilabial,</b> velar and often palatal consonants, but a complete absence of uvular or glottal consonants. Both stops and nasals occur at all six places, and in some languages laterals occur at all four coronal places.|$|E
50|$|Labial consonants are consonants {{in which}} one or both lips are the active articulator. The two common labial articulations are <b>bilabials,</b> {{articulated}} using both lips, and labiodentals, articulated with the lower lip against the upper teeth, {{both of which are}} present in English. A third labial articulation is dentolabials, articulated with the upper lip against the lower teeth (the reverse of labiodental), normally only found in pathological speech. Generally precluded are linguolabials, in which the tip of the tongue contacts the posterior side of the upper lip, making them coronals, though sometimes, they behave as labial consonants.|$|R
5000|$|The fricatives f and w {{are both}} labiodentals, {{according}} to Pilhofer (1933), but <b>bilabials,</b> according to Flierl and Strauss (1977).

Both Pilhofer (1933: 15) and Flierl and Strauss (1977) describe the labiovelars q and ɋ as coarticulated and simultaneously released kp and gb, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. This article gives a {{detailed}} quantitative account of Samoan root phonotactics. In particular, count data {{is given in}} eleven tables of segment frequencies (i. e., consonants, short and long vowels, diphthongs) and frequencies of combinations of segments (i. e., syllable types, consonant-vowel combinations, V-V and C-C combinations across syllables). Systematic patterns of over- and under-representation of these structures in the lexicon are documented and related to prior research. Beyond the detailed frequency facts presented here, new empirical patterns documented include positional preferences for <b>bilabials</b> and non-labial sonorants, extensions of a known pattern of gradient vowel assimilation, and identification of a role for manner and segment order in consonant co-occurrence restrictions...|$|R
25|$|From 1814, missionaries {{tried to}} define {{the sounds of the}} language. Thomas Kendall {{published}} a book in 1815 entitled A korao no New Zealand, which in modern orthography and usage would be He Kōrero nō Aotearoa. Professor Samuel Lee, working with chief Hongi Hika and Hongi's junior relative Waikato at Cambridge University, established a definitive orthography based on Northern usage in 1820. Professor Lee's orthography continues in use, with only two major changes: the addition of wh to distinguish the voiceless <b>bilabial</b> fricative phoneme from the labio-velar phoneme /w/; and the consistent marking of long vowels. The macron has become the generally accepted device for marking long vowels (hāngi), but double vowel letters have also been used (haangi).|$|E
25|$|Like young {{children}} most of Genie's first words were monosyllabic consonant-vowel-(consonant) sequences, usually consisting of an unaspirated <b>Bilabial</b> stop or dental stop and a monophthong. But while most children's first disyllabic words also follow this pattern, hers had both consonant-vowel and vowel-consonant sequences. Unusually, {{from the very}} first disyllabic words Genie more fully articulated, except when referring to herself by her (real) name she immediately demonstrated proper stress patterns. For approximately two years the length of time she held out a vowel was her only stress indicator, and during that time was very exaggerated. People unfamiliar with her speech said she sounded either like a deaf child or someone with cerebral palsy, although trained speech pathologists only said the latter.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{different}} {{techniques of}} how to produce whistle speech, the choice of which is dependent on practical concerns. <b>Bilabial</b> and labiodental techniques are common for short and medium distance discussions (in a market, in the noise of a room, or for hunting); whereas the tongue retroflexed, one or two fingers introduced in the mouth, a blow concentrated at the junction between two fingers or the lower lip pulled while breathing in air are techniques used to reach high levels of power for long distance speaking. Each place has its favorite trend {{that depends on the}} most common use of the village and on the personal preferences of each whistler. Whistling with a leaf or a flute is often related to courtship or poetic expression (reported in the Kickapoo language in Mexico and in the Hmong and Akha cultures in Asia).|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{categories}} that are basic in linguistic representation {{is an important issue}} in speech perception. How listeners extract messages from physical signals may depend on what the fundamental units of those messages are. In this dissertation, I present two experiments, designed to test how listeners use certain acoustic cues to classify English stop consonants with regard to two phonological dimensions, place of articulation and voicing. Statistical models of listener classification suggest that the categorization observed here is best described using the phonological category of distinctive feature. Features are argued {{to play a role in}} classification and are fundamental to speech perception. ^ In Experiment 1, 12 different VOT continua, using four types of F 1 transitions combined with the higher formant transitions appropriate for <b>bilabials,</b> alveolars, and velars, were used to evaluate the effects of F 1 transition and place of articulation on voice classification. A logistic regression analysis suggests that F 1 transition and place of articulation both affect (voice) classification, largely independently. <b>Bilabials</b> were more likely than velars to be judged (-voice), independent of F 1 transition and VOT. At the same time, increasing F 1 transition onset frequency and shortening the transition duration led to more (-voice) judgments, independent of place of articulation and VOT. ^ A two-dimensional stimulus continuum in which both VOT and F 2 onset transition were varied in Experiment 2 in order to evaluate the interaction between (place) and (voice) classification. Loglinear techniques, are used to measure the effects of the perception of (place) and (voice) on each other as well as the effects of VOT and F 2 onset on the perception of hath phonological categories. Statistical models of the data in suggest that the perception of (place) and (voice) affect each other, independent of the primary acoustic cues that give rise to the perception of (place) and (voice). ...|$|R
40|$|A set {{of three}} perceptual {{experiments}} is described. These experiments were designed to provide identification scores on CV sequences for French. Original stimuli were augmented with acoustic "monsters" where burst were excised or replaced. The first identification task shows that information carried by vocalic transitions can be overwritten by burst information. The importance of this phenomenon is inversely proportional to vowel aperture. The second experiment shows that these results are almost insensitive to relative amplitudes between the burst and the vowel. In the third experiment we manipulated the voice onset time (VOT) of the monsters using high quality analysis-resynthesis. Stimuli with a very short VOT were perceived as <b>bilabials</b> but VOT manipulation {{did not affect the}} /t/-/k/ confusions. These experiments claim for a dynamic model of stop identification where burst and vocalic transitions both contribute and compete to the phonetic decision. 1.

500|$|Representations of {{consonant}} sounds {{outside of}} the core set are created by adding diacritics to letters with similar sound values.

5000|$|These {{terms are}} built up from speech sounds that are easiest to produce (<b>bilabials</b> like m, p, and b {{and the open}} vowel a).

Very few languages lack labial consonants (this mostly being attested on a family basis, in the Iroquoian {{and some of the}} Athabaskan languages), and only Arapaho is known to lack an open vowel a.

2500|$|The nasalisation of vowels and consonants in Mixtec is an {{interesting}} phenomenon that has had various analyses. All of the analyses agree that nasalization is contrastive {{and that it is}} somewhat restricted. In most varieties, it is clear that nasalization is limited to the right edge of a morpheme (such as a noun or verb root), and spreads leftward until it is blocked by an obstruent (plosive, affricate or fricative in the list of Mixtec consonants). A somewhat more abstract analysis of the Mixtec facts claims that the spreading of nasalization is responsible for the surface [...] "contrast" [...] between two kinds of <b>bilabials</b> ( [...] and , with and without the influence of nasalization, respectively), between two kinds of palatals ( [...] and nasalized —often less accurately (but more easily) transcribed as —with and without nasalization, respectively), and even two kinds of coronals ( [...] and , with and without nasalization, respectively). Nasalized vowels which are contiguous to the nasalized variants are less strongly nasalized than in other contexts. This situation is known to have been characteristic of Mixtec for at least the last 500 years since the earliest colonial documentation of the language shows the same distribution of consonants.|$|R
