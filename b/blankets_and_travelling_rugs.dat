60|$|There was no {{stopping}} our cussedness. We rigged up a mast, piled {{on the canvas}} (<b>blankets),</b> <b>and</b> <b>travelled</b> short hours while the Army worked over-time to keep us in sight. Then General Kelly had recourse to diplomacy. No boat could touch us in the straight-away. Without discussion, we were the hottest bunch that ever came down the Des Moines. The ban of the police-boats was lifted. Colonel Speed was put aboard, and with this distinguished officer we had the honor of arriving first at Keokuk on the Mississippi. And right here I {{want to say to}} General Kelly and Colonel Speed that here's my hand. You were heroes, both of you, and you were men. And I'm sorry for at least ten per cent of the trouble that was given you by the head-boat of Company M.|$|R

40|$|In {{the early}} 1970 s a failed effort at {{creating}} Osborne Reef, an artificial fishery, {{resulted in the}} release of two million tires into the Atlantic Ocean outside Fort Lauderdale, Florida, further endangering already threatened coral reef habitat. The tires <b>blanket</b> habitat areas <b>and</b> <b>travel</b> with ocean <b>and</b> storm currents, impacting delicate coral structures along the way. Efforts to remove the tires have proven inadequate at addressing this ecological threat. Through interviews and academic research we have studied the history and practice of artificial reef construction in general, and the Osborne Reef in particular. Proposed {{are a series of}} interventions created using parametric modelling techniques designed for three roles. First, they will neutralize the threat caused by the tires either by encapulating them under or accreting them along its structure. Second, they will mitigate tire-associated damage and loss and serving as a medium for coral and marine organism growth. Third, it will serve as a laboratory for novel marine ecological restoration techniques as a jointly managed public- private partnership...|$|R
60|$|We rebuilt our fire, {{after many}} {{repeated}} demands for kindling, which had apparently to be sawed and split {{in a distant}} wood-yard before we could get it, and then the long, arctic night set in, unrelieved by the noisy gayeties of the cafe across the way. These burst {{from time to time}} the thin film of sleep which formed like a coating of ice over the consciousness, and then one could only get up and put more wood into the despairing stove and more clothes on the beds. Well for us that we had thought to bring all our <b>travelling</b> <b>rugs</b> with us in straps, instead of abandoning them with our other baggage in the station till next day! But, even with these heaping the hotel <b>blankets</b> <b>and</b> com-forters, we shivered, and a superannuated odor that had lurked in the recesses of those rooms, to which the sun or wind had never pierced, grew with the growing cold, and haunted the night like something palpable as well as sensible--the materialization of smells dead and buried there long ago. It was wonderful how little way the electric bulb shed its beams in that naughty air; it would not even light the page which at one time was opened in the vain hope that the author would help the benumbing cold to bring torpor if not slumber to the weary brain.|$|R

50|$|Sheep {{and goats}} were most valued for their milk, meat, and wool. The wool of sheep in {{particular}} was very valuable. The shearing was usually done in the spring before the herds were moved to mountain pastures. Most importantly, it was used for making felt to insulate Mongolian homes, called gers, however it was also used for rugs, saddle <b>blankets,</b> <b>and</b> clothing. Ideal herd numbers were usually about 1000. To reach this quota, groups of people would combine their herds <b>and</b> <b>travel</b> together with their sheep and goats.|$|R
