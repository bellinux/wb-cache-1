2500|$|There is, however, a {{complication}} {{that increases}} the volume of air {{that needs to be}} inhaled per minute (respiratory minute volume) to provide the same amount of oxygen to the lungs at altitude as at sea level. During inhalation the air is warmed and saturated with water vapor during its passage through the nose passages and pharynx. Saturated water vapor pressure is dependent only on temperature. At a <b>body</b> <b>core</b> <b>temperature</b> of 37°C [...] it is 6.3kPa (47.0mmHg), irrespective of any other influences, including altitude. Thus at sea level, where the ambient atmospheric pressure is about 100kPa, the moistened air that flows into the lungs from the trachea consists of water vapor (6.3kPa), nitrogen (74.0kPa), oxygen (19.7kPa) and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases (a total of 100kPa). In dry air the partial pressure of O2 at sea level is 21.0kPa (i.e. 21% of 100kPa), compared to the 19.7kPa of oxygen entering the alveolar air. (The tracheal partial pressure of oxygen is 21% of [...] = 19.7kPa). [...] At the summit of Mt. Everest (at an altitude of 8,848m or 29,029ft) the total atmospheric pressure is 33.7kPa, of which 7.1kPa (or 21%) is oxygen. The air entering the lungs also has a total pressure of 33.7kPa, of which 6.3kPa is, unavoidably, water vapor (as it is at sea level). This reduces the partial pressure of oxygen entering the alveoli to 5.8kPa (or 21% of [...] = 5.8kPa). The reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air is therefore substantially greater than the reduction of the total atmospheric pressure at altitude would suggest (on Mt Everest: 5.8kPa vs. 7.1kPa).|$|E

30|$|The <b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> of a {{human is}} one of the vital {{statistics}} used to determine individual health. Normal human body temperature (normothermia) is approximately 37 °C, with variations depending on factors such as age and geological factor [13]. When the body fails to regulate itself by dissipating heat, it increases the <b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> above the normal condition. This condition is called hyperthermia. The highest recorded surviving <b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> is 45 °C [14]. Generally, there are four locations [15] {{that can be used to}} measure human <b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature,</b> rectal (anus), oral (mouth), tympanic (ear) and axillary (armpit), with the rectal measurement considered to be the most accurate in measuring the <b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature.</b> Rectal measurement of body temperature is the preferred method to perform a <b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> measurement.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Current {{knowledge}} about the incidence and risk factors for exertional hyperthermia (<b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> >/= 40 degrees C) is predominantly based on military populations or small-sized studies in athletes. We assessed the incidence of exertional hyperthermia in 227 participants of a 15 -km running race, and identified predictors for exertional hyperthermia. DESIGN: Observational study. METHODS: We measured intestinal <b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> before and immediately after the race. To identify predictive factors of maximum <b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature,</b> we entered sex, age, BMI, post-finish dehydration, number of training weeks, fluid intake {{before and during the}} race, finish time, and <b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> change during warming-up into a backward linear regression analysis. Additionally, two subgroups of hyperthermic and non-hyperthermic participants were compared. RESULTS: In a WBGT of 11 degrees C, <b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> increased from 37. 6 +/- 0. 4 degrees C at baseline to 37. 8 +/- 0. 4 degrees C after warming-up, and 39. 2 +/- 0. 7 degrees C at the finish. A total of 15 % of all participants had exertional hyperthermia at the finish. Age, BMI, fluid intake before the race and the <b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> change during warming-up significantly predicted maximal <b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> (p< 0. 001).

40|$|A rodent {{model was}} used to {{evaluate}} the association between hypothermia and basal vacuolization in renal tubular epithelial cells. 28 Sprague Dawley rats were anaesthetized in non-stressful conditions and placed two at a time into a cooling chamber. <b>Body</b> <b>core</b> <b>temperatures</b> dropped to a minimum of 7 - 10  °C, causing death under anaesthesia at times varying from 120 to 240  min.

Examination of haematoxylin and eosin-stained renal sections failed to reveal basal vacuolization of renal tubular epithelial cells in any of the 28 animals. In this model, no evidence of subnuclear lipid vacuolization of renal tubular cells could be demonstrated despite significant and eventually lethal hypothermia.

50|$|Human {{expenditure}} of energy results in the generation of heat. The body heat generated by normal activities, and particularly by exercise, triggers homeostatic regulatory mechanisms {{with the goal of}} maintaining <b>body</b> <b>core</b> <b>temperature</b> within its relatively narrow, safe physiologic range by means of vasoregulation and diaphoresis. The weightlessness environment of spaceflight may impair heat dissipation by reducing evaporative and conductive heat exchange. Microgravity and spaceflight may perturb the body’s thermoregulatory mechanisms by altering the work efficiency, metabolic rate, or circadian rhythms of heat production. Additionally, human space travelers are often not well hydrated, have a 10-15% decrease in intravascular fluid (plasma) volume, and may lose both their preflight muscular and cardiovascular fitness levels as well as their thermoregulatory capabilities. As a result, they may become less heat-acclimated or may acquire an altered thermal sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|Human beings {{produce an}} {{obligatory}} ~100 watts of heat energy as a by-product from basic processes like pumping blood, digesting, breathing, biochemical synthesis and catabolism etc. This {{is comparable to}} a common incandescent light-bulb. Hence, if the body were perfectly insulated, core temperature would continue to increase until lethal core temperatures were achieved. Conversely, we are normally in surroundings that are considerably colder than <b>body</b> <b>core</b> <b>temperature</b> (37 degrees Celsius or 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and hence {{there is a large}} gradient for thermal energy flow from the core to the surroundings. Therefore, the body must ensure it can also minimize the loss of heat to around 100 watts, if it is to maintain core temperature. In short, the skin must be able to get rid of 100 watts of heat in relatively warm environments, but also ensure that it does not lose too much more than this in relatively cold environments.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2015, L. guttatus {{was shown}} to {{maintain}} its entire body core above ambient temperature, becoming the first known fish with this trait ('whole-body endothermy'). [...] The fish generates heat as well as propulsion with continuous movements of its pectoral fins (the musculature of which is insulated by a one-cm-thick layer of fat), and the vasculature of its gill tissue is arranged to conserve heat by a process of countercurrent heat exchange, a structure known as a rete mirabile (plural, retia). [...] It can consistently keep its body core approximately 5 °C warmer than its environment. Elevated <b>body</b> <b>core</b> <b>temperature</b> should improve aerobic performance and physiologic function.

40|$|International audienceIn thermal neutral condition, rats display cyclic {{variations}} of the vasomotion of the tail and paws, synchronized with fluctuations of blood pressure, heart rate, and <b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature.</b> ``On-'' and ``off-'' cells located in the rostral ventromedial medulla, a cerebral structure implicated in somatic sympathetic drive, 1) exhibit similar spontaneous cyclic activities in antiphase and 2) are activated and inhibited by thermal nociceptive stimuli, respectively. We aimed at evaluating the implication of such neurons in autonomic regulation by establishing correlations between their firing and blood pressure, heart rate, and skin and <b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> variations. When, during a cycle, a relative high <b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> was reached, the on-cells were activated and within half a minute, the off-cells and blood pressure were depressed, followed by heart rate depression within a further minute; vasodilatation of the tail followed invariably within similar to 3 min, often completed with vasodilatation of hind paws. The outcome was an increased heat loss that lessened the <b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature.</b> When the decrease of <b>core</b> <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> achieved a few tenths of degrees, sympathetic activation switches off and converse variations occurred, providing cycles of three to seven periods/h.
