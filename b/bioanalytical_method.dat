Even if several guidelines exist to help perform <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>method</b> validations, {{there is still the}} need to clarify the meaning and interpretation of <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>method</b> validation criteria and methodology. Yet, different interpretations can be made of the validation guidelines {{as well as for the}} definitions of the validation criteria. This will lead to diverse experimental designs implemented to try fulfilling these criteria. Finally, different decision methodologies can also be interpreted from these guidelines. Therefore, the risk that a validated <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>method</b> may be unfit for its future purpose will depend on analysts personal interpretation of these guidelines. The objective of this review is thus to discuss and highlight several essential aspects of methods validation, not only restricted to chromatographic ones but also to ligand binding assays owing to their increasing role in biopharmaceutical industries. The points that will be reviewed are the common validation criteria, which are selectivity, standard curve, trueness, precision, accuracy, limits of quantification and range, dilutional integrity and analyte stability. Definitions, methodology, experimental design and decision criteria are reviewed.

40|$|For {{quantitative}} <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>method</b> {{validation procedure}} and requirements, {{there was a}} relatively good agreement between chromatographic assays and ligand-binding assays. It was realized that the quantitative and qualitative aspects of <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>method</b> validation should be reviewed and applied appropriately. Some of the major concerns between the 2 methodologies related to the acceptable total error for precision and accuracy determination and acceptance criteria for an analytical run. The acceptable total error for precision and accuracy for both the methodologies is less than 30. The 4 – 6 – 15 rule for accepting an analytical run by a chromatographic method remained acceptable while a 4 – 6 – 20 rule was recommended for ligand-binding methodology. The 3 rd AAPS/FDA Bioanalytical Workshop clarified the issues related to placement of QC samples, determination of matrix effect, stability considerations, use of internal standards, and system suitability tests. There was a major concern and issues raised with respect to stability and reproducibility of incurred samples. This should be addressed for all analytical methods employed.

However, {{there are a variety of}} circumstances in which the performance of a <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>method</b> when using standards and QCs may not adequately approximate that when using incurred samples. The objective of incurred sample reproducibility (ISR) testing is to demonstrate that a <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>method</b> will produce consistent results from study samples when re-analyzed on a separate occasion. The Third American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS) /Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Bioanalytical Workshop and subsequent workshops have led to widespread industry adoption of the so-called “ 4 – 6 – 20 ” rule for assessing incurred sample reproducibility (i. e. at least 66. 7 % of the re-analyzed incurred samples must agree within ± 20 % of the original result), though the performance of this rule in the context of ISR testing has not yet been evaluated.

Numerous <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>methods</b> exist to characterize the primary structure of proteins, post translational modifications; protein-substrate/protein/protein interactions and functional bioassays are available for most proteins that are developed as products.

For example, x-ray crystallography and NMR are impractical for routine use and do not capture the heterogeneity of the product. Conformation-sensitive antibodies {{can be used to}} map proteins. However the development of antibodies to represent sufficient epitopes can be challenging. Other limitations of antibodies include limited supply, high costs, heterogeneity and batch to batch variations in titer.
