500|$|In August 2006, Carson joined Charlton Athletic on {{loan for}} the 2006–07 season, after Charlton failed {{in a bid}} for Norwich City goalkeeper Robert Green. Carson {{explained}} that [...] "Liverpool {{want me to get}} some experience and then hopefully I can go back next season and be challenging Pepe [...] for the number one spot. There were a couple of Championship clubs interested <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to be playing Premiership football because Robert Green, Ben Foster and Chris Kirkland are going to be playing week in, week out so I need to be performing." [...] He played in 36 of 38 Premier League matches, missing only the two matches against Liverpool due to the terms of his loan deal. Although he was unable to prevent Charlton from being relegated at the end of 2006–07, his outstanding form led him to be named as the Charlton Athletic Player of the Year, the first loan player ever to receive the award.|$|E
500|$|Mendelson {{called the}} trailer [...] "a {{textbook}} case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there anyone {{out there who}} watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> more evidence'?" [...] He added that he was [...] "a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal," [...] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the [...] "courage" [...] to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the [...] "Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz". Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving [...] "us more explanation [...] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man", and by including Spider-Man since [...] "there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven {{to go out to}} the movies that day. There are any number of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [...] because it’s the sort of value-added element that can make [...] difference". Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal [...] "alone makes the trailer", describing it as feeling [...] "like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be." ...|$|E

Her marathon time of 3:01:53 was beaten by only two men. Only twenty days later, she attempted her first World Cup race, the Tongyeong BG Triathlon in Korea, but could only finish in 22nd place.

2500|$|The {{episode was}} criticized for {{dialogue}} referencing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Food Stamps benefit). In {{a scene from the}} episode, Patrick Star tries to show SpongeBob [...] "the benefits of being unemployed", to which SpongeBob replies, [...] "Unemployment may be fun for you, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to get a job." [...] The scene was meant to demonstrate the title character's [...] "eternal optimism and willingness to get back to work...in a way that's still funny and relatable". However, some political activists claimed the [...] "notorious line" [...] was a [...] "slam" [...] to the Food Stamps benefit. A report by The Hollywood Reporter alleged that the episode may have had a political agenda about the social safety net. It added that [...] "It's not the first time SpongeBob has waded into social commentary, though usually when it does, it bugs the right and supports the left." [...] The Hollywood Reporter cited the previous episodes [...] "SpongeBob's Last Stand" [...] and [...] "Selling Out" [...] for where [...] "environmentalism is glorified" [...] and [...] "large businesses are demonized".|$|E

He was seen standing on the field during the Patriots' post-game celebration; he later commented: [...] "I wanted {{to catch up to}} the moment of {{what it feels like to}} be on the other side, to be on this side, the losing side.

2500|$|The {{title track}} and opening song, [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again", was {{compared}} to her debut single, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), featuring a slap-and-pop bassline, synthesizer chord stabs and a mechanized beat. Lyrically, the song sees Spears warning to an overeager prospective lover: [...] "Oops, you think I'm in love/That I'm sent from above — I'm not that innocent." [...] The song also breaks down for a spoken-word interlude, involving {{a line from the}} film Titanic (1997). The second track [...] "Stronger" [...] is a synthpop and R track, which is lyrically a declaration of independence, where Spears leaves a partner who treats her like property. The line [...] "my loneliness ain't killing me no more" [...] makes reference to the verse [...] "my loneliness is killing me" [...] from her song [...] "...Baby One More Time". Another R track, which also adds a bit more funk to the mix, [...] "Don't Go Knocking on My Door" [...] finds Spears confidently forging ahead after a breakup. The fourth track, a cover of the Rolling Stones' [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", begins with mushy guitar plucking and breathy coos, until a dry, crackling lockstep is thrown down, turning the song into an urban stomp. The dance-pop version also jettisons the song's final verse and adds some new lyrics ("how white my shirts could be" [...] becomes [...] "how tight my skirt should be"). [...] " [...] was my idea [...] ", Spears said. [...] "I was just like, 'I like this song,' and I {{think it will be a}} really cool combination working with [...] Rodney [...] and doing a really funky song like that." [...] The fifth track, [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", was co-written by country-pop singer-songwriter Shania Twain and her then-husband, producer Robert [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, who also produced the track. The ballad, which boasts a slinky keyboard riff and Lange's characteristically lavish production, finds Spears allowing a bit of country twang into her vocals as she begs a lover to reveal his feelings: [...] "My friends say you're into me ... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to hear it straight from you", she sings. The sixth track [...] "What U See (Is What U Get)" [...] demands respect by rebuking a jealous partner, while the seventh track, [...] "Lucky", is a heart-rending tale of a Hollywood starlet's loneliness, proving that fame can be empty. [...] "If there's nothing missing in my life/Then why do these tears come at night?", she asks. [...] "School crush" [...] is the theme of [...] "One Kiss from You", a track that has a reggae-style beat and lyrics about the feelings of falling in love, and the quickness of it, with Spears cooing that after only one kiss she sees her entire future with her lover. The ballad [...] "Where Are You Now" [...] talks about wanting to know where a previous love is, and what that person is up to, so that she can finally let them go and find closure. Lines on [...] "Can't Make You Love Me", an Europop song, state that fancy cars and money pale in comparison to true love, with Spears singing: [...] "I'm just a girl with a crush on you." [...] The mid-tempo, synth-backed [...] "When Your Eyes Say It", written by songwriter Diane Warren, combines a string section with a loping hip hop beat, while Spears makes her own songwriting debut on the modest, keyboard-driven ballad [...] "Dear Diary", which she said is autobiographical. On the track, she sings of wanting to become [...] "so much more than friends" [...] with a boy.|$|E
