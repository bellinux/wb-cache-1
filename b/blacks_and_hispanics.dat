The case involved a habeas corpus petition submitted by Hector Ayala, who was arrested and tried in the late 1980s for the alleged murder of three individuals during an attempted robbery of an automobile body shop in San Diego, California in April 1985. At trial, the prosecution used peremptory challenges to strike all Black and Hispanic jurors who were available for jury service. The trial court judge allowed the prosecution to explain the basis for the peremptory challenges outside the presence of Ayala's counsel, [...] "so as not to disclose trial strategy". Ayala was ultimately sentenced to death, but he filed several appeals challenging the constitutionality of the trial court's decision to exclude his counsel from the hearings.|$|E

2500|$|According to Park (1998) the {{violence}} against Korean Americans in 1992 stimulated {{a new wave}} of political activism among Korean Americans, but it also split them into two main camps.

2500|$|All populations {{experience}} hip fractures but numbers {{vary with}} race, gender, and age. Women suffer {{three times as}} many hip fractures as men. In a lifetime, men have an estimated 6% risk whereas postmenopausal women have an estimated 14% risk of suffering a hip fracture. [...] These statistics provide insight over a lifespan and conclude that women {{are twice as likely to}} suffer a hip fracture. The overwhelming majority of hip fractures occur in white individuals while <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hispanics</b> have a lower rate of them. This may be due to their generally greater bone density and also because whites have longer overall lifespan and higher likelihood of reaching an advanced age where the risk of breaking a hip goes up. Deprivation is also a key factor: in England it has been found that people in the poorest parts of the country are more likely to fracture a hip and less likely to recover well than those in the least deprived areas.|$|E
2500|$|Polish Americans {{settled and}} created a {{thriving}} community in Detroit's east side. The name [...] "Poletown" [...] was first {{used to describe the}} community in 1872, where there was a high number of Polish residents and businesses. Historically, Poles took great pride in their communities; in a 1912 survey of Chicago, in the black section, 26% of the homes were in good repair while 71% of the Polish homes were; by contrast, only 54% of the ethnically mixed stockyards district were in good repair. Polish neighborhoods were consistently low on FBI crime rate statistics, particularly in Pennsylvania, despite being economically depressed during much of the 20th century. Polish Americans were highly reluctant to move to the suburbs as other white ethnics were fleeing Detroit. Poles had invested millions of dollars in their churches and parochial schools, and World War I drives drained their savings (the Polish National Fund alone received $5,187,000 by 1920). Additional savings were given to family and friends from Poland, where many immigrants and their children sent back money. During the 1960s, the black population of Detroit increased by 98,000, while 386,000 whites were leaving the city. Polish Americans and blacks entering the urban communities often lived next door to each other, and in close confrontations at times. In Chicago and in other northern cities, historian Joseph Parot observed real estate agents pressing white couples to move to the suburbs while encouraging blacks to move into Polish ethnic communities. Parot found that housing patterns commonly showed white ethnics such as Poles and Italians were used as [...] "buffer zones" [...] between black and white areas in multiple cities. Poles who stayed in the cities generally lost ties with their children, who moved away to start new families, and faced an increase in crime and racial tension with the growing black population. In the mid-1960s, the few Polish American protests against the disintegration of their ethnic communities were portrayed in the media as [...] "racist". Poles were not cooperative with government incursions into their neighborhoods; in Pittsburgh's Model Cities Program, tax money paid by the residents was used to tear down blocks of a Polish community to build low income housing for <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hispanics.</b> In the predominantly Polish Catholic parish of St. Thaddeus, parishioners were demoralized by orders made from the Archdiocese of Detroit mandating that a percentage of proceeds from church events go to serve low-income black parishes. Polish American Roman Gribbs who served from 1970 to 1974 when the city was roughly half-white and half-black, believes the major exodus of whites happened when children going to public school faced increased crime and physical danger in Detroit. Detroit became known as the murder capital of America during the 1970s, and Polish Americans residents suffered several murders. In 1975, the Detroit Polish community was disgusted by the innocent killing of Marian Pyszko, a World War II freedom fighter and 6-year concentration camp survivor who was killed by three African American youth who were avenging the accidental shooting of their friend. The man who shot their friend was sentenced to 3 years for reckless use of a firearm, but the three youths who killed Pyszko were acquitted of all charges by a biased jury. The jurors argued that the black riot was greater than the 3 boys (roughly 700 people were in the Livernois–Fenkell riot where Pyszko was targeted) and there was insufficient evidence to convict them. The Polish community was disgusted by the lack of justice it faced in Detroit, and enmity towards blacks grew during the 1960s and 1970s. Many Polish Americans were forced out by the construction of freeways, public housing, and industrial complexes. More than 25% of Hamtramck's population was displaced by the building of Interstate-75. Poles saw their communities disintegrate as forces such as blockbusting caused their longtime friends and neighbors to take white flight. The quality of life for those who stayed decreased rapidly, as did the sense of community: ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{uses the}} National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Kindergarten Cohort 1998 - 99 (ECLS-K) {{to examine how}} a range of {{educational}} achievement measures vary by gender, controlling for (other) individual, family, teacher and school characteristics. The paper identifies gender differences separately for white, <b>black,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> students. We find that girls of all races perform better on reading tests. White boys earn higher scores on math and science tests, while <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> boys earn the same scores as <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> girls on math tests, but earn higher scores on science tests. These differences appear in kindergarten and persist through the fifth grade. The gender gaps in test scores (objective assessments) are not mirrored in classroom grades (subjective assessments), which are considerably higher for girls in reading, but (statistically) similar for white girls and boys in math <b>and</b> science. <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> boys earn considerably lower grades {{in math and science}} despite their test scores being the same or higher than the test scores of <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> girls. Controlling for a lagged measure of classroom behavior achieves convergence on these objective and subjective assessments. Instrumenting contemporaneous behavior scores with lagged behavior scores results in boys and girls earning the same grades in reading, but boys earning higher grades in math and science. These results suggest an important role for non-cognitive skills in explaining the gender achievement gap. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{demonstrated}} by efforts to expand Medicaid coverage for poor and needy children, removing barriers {{to medical care}} {{continues to be an}} important social policy goal. Data from the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey, a multistage probability sample of 15, 000 US households, was used to examine some of the barriers that <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> children encounter in obtaining access to medical care. Results from the 1987 study indicate that <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> children were more likely than white children to be poor, uninsured members of single-parent households, and to have to wait longer to see a medical provider. Yet differences in waiting time at the usual source of care remained after controlling for insurance. In 1987, 18. 6 % of uninsured white children were without a usual source of care compared with 28. 4 % and 25. 2 % of uninsured <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> children, respectively. Furthermore, 17. 6 % of uninsured white children made at least one routine visit to a physician during 1987, while only 11. 4 % and 10. 6 % of the uninsured <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hispanic</b> children, respectively, saw a physician for a regular checkup...|$|R
