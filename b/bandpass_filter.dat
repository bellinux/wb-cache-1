5|$|The {{number of}} {{resonators}} in the expression {{corresponds to the}} number of passbands required. Lowpass and highpass filters can be viewed as special cases of the resonator expression with {{one or the other of}} the terms becoming zero as appropriate. Bandstop filters can be regarded as a combination of a lowpass and a highpass filter. Multiple bandstop filters can always be expressed in terms of a multiple <b>bandpass</b> <b>filter.</b> In this way it, can be seen that this transformation represents the general case for any bandform, and all the other transformations are to be viewed as special cases of it.|$|E
5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a <b>bandpass</b> <b>filter</b> circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|E
25|$|Image {{rejection}} is {{an important}} factor in choosing the intermediate frequency of a receiver. The farther apart the bandpass frequency and the image frequency are, the more the <b>bandpass</b> <b>filter</b> will attenuate any interfering image signal. Since the frequency separation between the bandpass and the image frequency is , a higher intermediate frequency improves image rejection. It may be possible to use a high enough first IF that a fixed-tuned RF stage can reject any image signals.|$|E

25|$|The {{signal is}} then fed into a circuit {{where it is}} mixed with a sine wave from a {{variable}} frequency oscillator known as the local oscillator (LO). The mixer uses a non-linear component to produce both sum and difference beat frequencies signals, each one containing the modulation contained in the desired signal. The output of the mixer may include the original RF signal at fRF, the local oscillator signal at fLO, and the two new heterodyne frequencies fRF+fLO and fRFfLO. The mixer may inadvertently produce additional frequencies such as third- and higher-order intermodulation products. Ideally, the IF <b>bandpass</b> <b>filter</b> removes all but the desired IF signal at fIF. The IF signal contains the original modulation (transmitted information) that the received radio signal had at fRF.|$|E
25|$|Every {{operation}} {{performed by}} a computer emits electromagnetic radiation and different operations emit radiation at different frequencies. In electromagnetic side-channel attacks, an attacker is only interested in a few frequencies at which encryption is occurring. Signal processing is responsible for isolating these frequencies from the vast multitude of extraneous radiation and noise. To isolate certain frequencies, a <b>bandpass</b> <b>filter,</b> which blocks frequencies outside of a given range, must {{be applied to the}} electromagnetic trace. Sometimes, the attacker does not know which frequencies encryption is performed at. In this case, the trace can be represented as a spectrogram, which can help determine which frequencies are most prevalent at different points of execution. Depending on the device being attacked and the level of noise, several filters may need to be applied.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{application}} of split ring resonators (SRRs) to the design of compact <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> for terahertz surface waves on single-wire waveguides, the so-called planar Goubau lines (PGLs). Through equivalent circuit models, electromagnetic simulations, and experiments, it is shown that, while a pair of SRRs coupled to a PGL inhibits the propagation of surface waves along the line, introducing a capacitive gap to the PGL switches the bandstop behavior to a bandpass behavior. In order to highlight the potential application of the proposed structure to the design of practical higher order terahertz <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters,</b> two types of compact <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> are designed and fabricated: 1) third-order periodic <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> based on SRR/gap-loaded PGL and 2) coupled-resonator <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters.</b> It is shown that, while the frequency response of the both filter types can be controlled by altering the physical dimensions of the structure, a wider bandwidth can be achieved from the coupled-resonator filters. The design concept and simulation results are validated through experiments. Ali K.

2500|$|A {{resonant}} circuit (tuned circuit) which serves {{to select the}} frequency of the desired radio station out of all the radio signals received by the antenna. The tuned circuit consists of a coil of wire (called an inductor) and a capacitor connected together, so as to create a circuit that resonates at {{the frequency of the}} desired station, and hence [...] "tune" [...] in that station. One or both of the coil or capacitor is adjustable, allowing the circuit to be tuned to different frequencies. In some circuits a capacitor is not used, as the antenna also serves as the capacitor.

In this paper we propose a novel front-end technique to directly down-convert multiple frequency division multiplexed (FDM) signals separated by certain minimum frequency. A special downconversion function is derived to achieve simultaneous downconversion of the received signals. The technique requires simpler <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> and the ADC has a baseband input as compared to bandpass sampling, which imposes strict requirements on <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> and requires an ADC which can handle RF inputs.
