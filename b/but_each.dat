5|$|In {{order to}} learn magic, the party must rescue spirits known as Elementals. The eight Elementals {{represent}} different elements—such as water, earth, and life—and each provides the player with specific spells. Magic has skill levels similar to weapons, <b>but</b> <b>each</b> magic spell costs magic points to cast.|$|E

5|$|The enemy {{made many}} {{attempts}} to encircle the regiment, <b>but</b> <b>each</b> time they failed {{because of the}} many casualties inflicted by the 65th. Because the 65th held their positions, that enabled the U.S. Marines {{to withdraw from the}} Chosin Reservoir on December 1950.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{over-riding}} story arc between episodes, <b>but</b> <b>each</b> episode does contain recurring elements. During each episode {{there are}} cutaways {{from the main}} plot to create extra gags. Most episodes also feature at least one celebrity appearance and every episode features a comic song.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{cartoonist}} Antonucci conceived Ed, Edd n Eddy {{while working}} on a commercial design. Antonucci pitched the series to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. Both studios {{were interested in the}} series, <b>but</b> <b>each</b> demanded creative control and Antonucci refused. Cartoon Network ended up commissioning the show after agreeing to let Antonucci have control of the show. After its debut, the series was a success in Nielsen ratings, popular among younger and older viewers. Met with generally positive reviews, the season earned Antonucci a Reuben Award for Best Television Animation.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1915, both boats {{conducted}} reconnaissance cruises out {{of either}} Trieste or Pola until declared obsolete in early 1918. Both remained in {{service as a}} training boats at the submarine base on Brioni, <b>but</b> <b>each</b> was at Pola {{at the end of}} the war. They were ceded to Italy as war reparations in 1920 and scrapped at Pola. Neither submarine sank any ships during the war.|$|E
5|$|Contestants {{are given}} a series of lifelines to aid them with {{difficult}} questions. They can use as many lifelines as desired per question, <b>but</b> <b>each</b> lifeline can only be used once per game. Three lifelines {{are available from the}} start of the game. Depending on the format of the show, additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth question. In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily paused the clock while the lifelines were played.|$|E

5|$|Defining {{themselves}} as both Swedish and American, the Swedish-American community retained a fascination {{for the old}} country {{and their relationship to}} it. The nostalgic visits to Sweden which had begun in the 1870s continued well into the 20th century, and narratives from these trips formed a staple of the lively Swedish-American publishing companies. The accounts testify to complex feelings, <b>but</b> <b>each</b> contingent of American travellers were freshly indignant at Swedish class pride and Swedish disrespect for women. It was with renewed pride in American culture that they returned to the Midwest.|$|E
5|$|Imprisoned debtors {{were allowed}} some social contact, but the regime for criminals was {{designed}} to be one of isolation, according to the separate system. Consequently, the seating in the prison chapel is designed to enclose each prisoner individually so that the preacher could see everyone <b>but</b> <b>each</b> could see only him. By 1878 the system was discredited and the inmates were transferred to the new gaol in the eastern outskirts of Lincoln. The prison in the castle was left without a use until the Lincolnshire Archives were housed in its cells.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, Cantor's Halle {{colleague}} Eduard Heine died, {{creating a}} vacant chair. Halle accepted Cantor's suggestion {{that it be}} offered to Dedekind, Heinrich M.

5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century several {{attempts}} were made to erect a monument honoring Jennings's public service. On three separate occasions, in 1861, 1869 and 1889, petitions were brought before the Indiana General Assembly to erect a marker for Jennings's grave, <b>but</b> <b>each</b> attempt failed. In 1892 the state legislature finally granted the petition to erect a monument in his honor. Around the same time, after Jennings's unmarked gravesite was independently verified by three witnesses to his burial, his body was exhumed and reinterred at a new site at the Charlestown cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Nuaym's stratagem worked. After consulting, the Confederate leaders sent Ikrimah to the Qurayza, {{signalling}} {{a united}} invasion of Medina. The Qurayza, however, demanded hostages as {{a guarantee that}} the Confederacy would not desert them. The Confederacy, considering that the Qurayza might give the hostage to Muhammad, refused. Messages were repeatedly sent {{back and forth between}} the parties, <b>but</b> <b>each</b> held to its position stubbornly.|$|E
5|$|Pyrosomes are colonial tunicates {{and each}} zooid has {{a pair of}} {{luminescent}} organs {{on either side of}} the inlet siphon. When stimulated by light, these turn on and off, causing rhythmic flashing. No neural pathway runs between the zooids, <b>but</b> <b>each</b> responds to the light produced by other individuals, and even to light from other nearby colonies. Communication by light emission between the zooids enables coordination of colony effort, for example in swimming where each zooid provides part of the propulsive force.|$|E

5|$|Somewhat {{apocryphal}} stories tell of Augustus {{pleading with}} Tiberius to stay, even {{going so far}} as to stage a serious illness. Tiberius's response was to anchor off the shore of Ostia until word came that Augustus had survived, then sailing straightway for Rhodes. Tiberius reportedly regretted his departure and requested to return to Rome several times, <b>but</b> <b>each</b> time Augustus refused his requests.|$|E
5|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of galaxies have been catalogued, {{but only a few}} have well-established names, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, the Whirlpool Galaxy, and the Sombrero Galaxy.

All of the well-known galaxies appear in {{one or more of these}} catalogues <b>but</b> <b>each</b> time under a different number.|$|E
