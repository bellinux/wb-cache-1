5000|$|Trishna {{was given}} the {{singular}} honour of thereafter being transported to New Delhi and took part on a tableau during the Republic Day Parade, 1987. This in itself was a herculean effort as the boat had reached Mumbai on 10 Jan 1987 itself {{and to participate in}} the Republic Day Parade on 26th, the boat had to be transported to New Delhi, the tableau to be fabricated to the exacting standards of the Ministry of Defence and cleared by their internal committee well before the rehearsals commenced. It seemed an impossible task, but with the concerted efforts of all those involved, the Indian Railways provided the carriage, Naval Dockyard Mumbai fabricated the <b>boat</b> <b>cradle</b> overnight on the railway carriage and then again the Railways moved it at express speed, literally, to New Delhi. The Bengal Engineer Group, Roorkee sent their fabrication team and completed the fabrication work at Vijay Chowk itself since the boat with its 54 ft high mast could not be transported anywhere else in the capital.A commemorative postage stamp was released by India Post on the arrival of the boat back in Bombay on 10 January 1987.The crew of Trishna was also honoured with the Order of Merit by the Ocean Cruising Club which recognised the voyage as the first circumnavigation by an Indian yacht (at Ser. 182) ...|$|E

50|$|During {{the spring}} flood in 1979, BYC members volunteered to line sandbags along the pier, {{mouth of the}} harbour, along circle drive, the catwalk, <b>boat</b> storage <b>cradles,</b> and along {{the front of the}} Club. The pier and gas pump area were under water.|$|R
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{junction}} near Stirchley Tunnel, the canal passed over an aqueduct {{across the road}} to the village of Aqueduct, and then began curving round to the north-west. Dawley Castle Furnaces were {{to the north of the}} canal, and Botany Bay Colliery to the south. There were several other small collieries near the route, which followed the contours to a point near Doseley church. A tramway headed northwards to Horsehay Furnaces, while the canal turned sharply to the south. Two bridges carried Holywell Lane and Green Lane over it, before it reached the [...] "Wind", the name given to the twin shafts which descended [...] to the Coalbrookdale Works and its tramway. After just two years, they were replaced by an inclined plane, on which tramway wagons were used, rather than <b>boat</b> <b>cradles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Big Chute Marine Railway is {{a patent}} slip at lock 44 of the Trent-Severn Waterway in Ontario, Canada. It works on an {{inclined}} plane to carry <b>boats</b> in individual <b>cradles</b> over {{a change of}} height of about 60 ft. It is the only marine railway (or canal inclined plane) {{of its kind in}} North America still in use, and is overseen by federally operated Parks Canada.|$|R
25|$|The Scotch (reaction) turbines, {{which later}} {{replaced}} the overshot water wheels, were 12½ feet in diameter, {{were made of}} cast iron, and could pull the boats up an 11% grade (11 foot rise over 100 feet). The longest plane was the double-tracked Plane 9 West which was 1,510 feet long and lifted boats 100 feet up (i.e. 6% grade) in 12 minutes. The total weight of the <b>boat,</b> cargo, and <b>cradle</b> was about 110-125 tons.|$|R
50|$|After {{operations}} {{along the}} Atlantic coast, the oiler transited the Panama Canal and sailed 18 February 1943 for Fanui Bay, Bora Bora, mothering a brood of 11 subchasers, five yard minesweepers, numerous LCI(L)’s, and one net tender. Four motor torpedo <b>boats</b> nested in <b>cradles</b> {{in the forward}} and after well decks. Pecos fueled each small craft every four days. Throughout the voyage, groups of boats came alongside the tanker for fuel; then, replenished, gave place to others. Pecos next supported the landings at Tarawa, Gilbert Islands, refueling the bombardment and transport groups. She returned to the West Coast late in 1943 and departed San Pedro, Calif., on New Year’s Eve after undergoing repairs and loading with oil and supplies.|$|R
50|$|The Shrewsbury Canal {{was finally}} {{finished}} in 1797, being 17 miles (27 km) long, with 11 locks. At Trench an inclined plane was built, which was 223 yd long and raised boats 75 ft {{up to the}} Wombridge Canal, from where they could travel via the Shropshire Canal southwards to the River Severn at Coalport. The plane consisted of twin railway tracks, each of which held a <b>cradle.</b> <b>Boats</b> would be floated onto the cradles, which had larger wheels at the back to keep the boat level. A third set of wheels were mounted at the front, which ran on extra rails in the dock, to prevent the cradle tipping forwards as it ran over the top cill. The plane opened in 1794, and although it was partially counterbalanced, with loaded boats going down the plane pulling empty boats up, a steam engine was also provided, to pull the boats over the top cill. This and the rails were provided by Reynolds' Coalbrookdale Company. In 1840 the rails were replaced with edge rails, allowing the use of conventional flanged wheels on the cradles, and the engine was replaced in 1842, with a high pressure Cornish engine, again ordered from the Coalbrookdale Company. The plane continued to be used until 1921, making it the last operational plane in Britain.|$|R
