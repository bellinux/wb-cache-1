5|$|Addington Long <b>Barrow</b> is a {{chambered}} long <b>barrow</b> {{located near}} {{to the village of}} Addington in the southeastern English county of Kent. Constructed during Britain's Early Neolithic period, today it survives only in a ruined state. Built out of earth and around fifty local sarsen megaliths, the long <b>barrow</b> consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus enclosed by kerb-stones. Collapsed stones on the northeastern end of the chamber probably represented a stone chamber in which human remains might have been deposited; none, however, have been discovered.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of dietary feather meal (FM, 0 and 20 %) and space allocation (8. 3 [UC] and 6. 2 [C] ft 2 / pig) on growth and carcass characteristics of <b>barrows.</b> Control <b>barrows</b> (0 % FM and UC) had 10 % higher ADFI than gilts (0 % FM and UC), but only 2. 6 % greater ADG. Crowded <b>barrows</b> fed 20 % FM diet from 165 lb to slaughter had decreased ADG and ADFI compared to control <b>barrows.</b> Crowded <b>barrows</b> fed a diet with no FM had a 4. 9 % reduction in ADFI compared to control <b>barrows,</b> and crowded <b>barrows</b> fed 20 % FM diet had an ADFI (8. 3 % reduction compared to control <b>barrows)</b> similar to gilts. Gilts had improved feed efficiency compared to <b>barrows.</b> Control <b>barrows</b> reached market weight 7 days earlier than gilts, crowded <b>barrows,</b> and crowded <b>barrows</b> fed a 20 % FM diet. Control <b>barrows</b> and gilts had similar average daily lean gain while crowded <b>barrows</b> fed 20 % FM from 165 lb to slaughter had a decreased average daily lean gain. Gilts had less backfat and larger loin eye area than <b>barrows</b> on all treatments. Gilts also had a higher primal cut percentage and carcass lean percentage than <b>barrows.</b> Crowded <b>barrows</b> had a higher dressing percentage than uncrowded <b>barrows.</b> The combination of crowding and feeding feather meal reduced growth of <b>barrows</b> to a rate similar to gilts, but the improvements in backfat and carcass lean percentage observed previously by feeding feather meal to <b>barrows</b> were not observed in this study. Increasing stocking density is an effective method to decrease growth rate of <b>barrows...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} 17 ß- 19 -nortestosterone (17 ßNT) {{treatment}} of <b>barrows</b> on residue levels and growth was evaluated. Five <b>barrows</b> were treated three {{times during the}} fattening period with 17 ßNT phenylpropionate (Nandrosol, nandrolone phenylpropionate 50 ¿mg/ml, 1 ¿mg/kg body weight). Another five <b>barrows</b> were untreated and five boars (untreated) were kept as positive control. Boars and treated <b>barrows</b> showed a 13 and 9 % improvement in growth compared to untreated <b>barrows,</b> with mean final body weights of 121. 6, 117. 8 and 109. 0 ¿kg, respectively. The bulbourethral glands of the treated <b>barrows</b> were three times heavier than untreated <b>barrows.</b> The histology of the prostate and bulbourethral gland of the treated <b>barrows</b> was comparable to the boars, whereas the control <b>barrows</b> showed atrophic glands. Levels of 17 ßNT ester in hair from treated <b>barrows</b> were high, whereas boars and untreated <b>barrows</b> did not show levels above LLQ. It is concluded that analysis of hair can detect illegal treatment with 17 ßNT ester in <b>barrows.</b> The size of the bulbourethral gland {{can also be used}} for screening in the slaughterhouse...|$|R

5|$|Archaeologists have {{established}} that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long <b>barrow</b> building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe, Addington Long <b>Barrow</b> belongs to a localised regional variant of barrows produced {{in the vicinity of}} the River Medway, now known as the Medway Megaliths. Of these, it lies near to both Chestnuts Long <b>Barrow</b> and Coldrum Long <b>Barrow</b> on the western side of the river.

5|$|<b>Barrow</b> became {{manager of}} the Boston Red Sox in 1918. As the team lost many of its better players during World War I, <b>Barrow</b> {{encouraged}} owner Harry Frazee to purchase Stuffy McInnis, Wally Schang, Bullet Joe Bush, and Amos Strunk from the Philadelphia Athletics for $75,000 ($ in current dollar terms). During the season, <b>Barrow</b> feuded with his assistant, Johnny Evers, who undermined Barrow's leadership. The Red Sox won the 1918 World Series. Recognizing that star pitcher Babe Ruth was also a great power hitter, <b>Barrow</b> had Ruth pinch hit on days when he wasn't scheduled to pitch. When Ruth told <b>Barrow</b> that he could only pitch or hit, <b>Barrow</b> decided that Ruth's bat was more useful than his pitching, and transitioned him from a pitcher into an outfielder.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barrow</b> {{managed in}} the major leagues with the Detroit Tigers of the AL in 1903, {{finishing}} fifth, a thirteen-game improvement from their 1902 finish. With the Tigers, <b>Barrow</b> feuded with shortstop Kid Elberfeld. Tigers' owner Sam Angus sold the team to William Yawkey before the 1904 season. <b>Barrow</b> managed the Tigers again in 1904, but unable to coexist with Frank Navin, Yawkey's secretary-treasurer, <b>Barrow</b> tendered his resignation. He then managed the Montreal Royals of the Eastern League {{for the rest of the}} season. He managed the Indianapolis Indians of the Class-A American Association in 1905 and Toronto in 1906. Disheartened with baseball after finishing in last place, <b>Barrow</b> hired Joe Kelley to manage Toronto in 1907, and after signing the rest of the team's players, became manager of the Windsor Arms Hotel in Toronto.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstract To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} 17 β- 19 -nortestosterone (17 βNT) treatment of <b>barrows</b> on residue levels and on growth results, an animal experiment was conducted.

5|$|<b>Barrow</b> then {{bought the}} Paterson Silk Weavers of the Class-A Atlantic League, {{managing}} {{them for the}} rest of the 1896 season. <b>Barrow</b> discovered Honus Wagner throwing lumps of coal at a railroad station in Pennsylvania, and signed him to his first professional contract. <b>Barrow</b> sold Wagner to the Louisville Colonels of the National League (NL) for $2,100 the next year ($ in current dollar terms). With poor attendance, <b>Barrow</b> brought in professional boxers as a draw: he had James J. Corbett play first base while John L. Sullivan and James J. Jeffries umpired. He also hired Lizzie Arlington, the first woman in professional baseball, to pitch a few innings a game.|$|E

40|$|A {{mixture of}} <b>barrows</b> and gilts as fed for four trials {{over two years}} in bedded hoop {{structures}} and a confinement building with slotted floors. When the central Iowa summer and winter feeding periods for two years were combined, the trials showed that as expected the <b>barrows</b> grew faster, had thicker backfat, smaller loin muscle areas, and lower percentage of lean than the gilts. The hoop-reared <b>barrows</b> and gilts grew 3 % faster, but had thicker backfat (7. 9 % more for <b>barrows</b> and 6. 5 % for gilts) and 5 % smaller loin muscle areas {{than their counterparts in}} confinement. The hoop <b>barrows</b> and gilts were 1. 3 percentage units less lean than the confinement <b>barrows</b> and gilts. During the summer, the pigs in hoops grew faster than the pigs in confinement. During the winter the growth rate was similar. These trends were consistent for both <b>barrows</b> and gilts. However, during the summer, the <b>barrows</b> had 10. 6 % thicker backfat and the gilts had 11. 1 % thicker backfat than their counterparts in confinement. In winter, the hoop <b>barrows</b> had 5. 2 % thicker backfat than the confinement <b>barrows,</b> but the gilts’ backfat was similar. Also, during the summer, hoop <b>barrows</b> and gilts had 4. 5 – 4. 7 % smaller loin muscle areas than their counterparts in confinement. During the winter, the hoop <b>barrows</b> and gilts had 5. 7 % smaller loin muscle areas than their counterparts in confinement. Therefore, during the summer, <b>barrows</b> and gilts had 1. 6 – 1. 7 percentage units less calculated lean than pigs in confinement. And during the winter, hoop gilts and <b>barrows</b> had 1. 0 – 1. 2 percentage units less lean than pigs in confinement...|$|R
