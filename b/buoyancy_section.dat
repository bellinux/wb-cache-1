40|$|Deepwater {{oil and gas}} {{production}} is complicated by the structural complexity and uncertainty in prediction of the riser’s behavior. To date, Steel Lazy Wave Riser (SLWR) has been chosen {{as one of the most}} attractive riser designs in deeper waters and harsher environments since its buoyancy part absorbs the motions of the platform/vessel decoupling the Touchdown Point (TDP). When subjected to currents, risers may suffer Vortex-Induced Vibrations (VIV). VIV are caused by alternating shedding of vortices from both sides of the structure. If the frequency of vortex shedding is close to the riser’s natural frequency, it may lead to rapid accumulation of bending stresses causing to fatigue damage. The vortex shedding process for bare and buoyancy part of SLWR is different due to the difference in diameters. Consequently, the VIV responses of the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>section</b> (which consists of the parts of both diameters) will be governed by the interaction of these two processes. The main factors influencing this interaction are the length of <b>buoyancy</b> <b>section,</b> diameter of the buoyancy elements, their arrangement, etc. Thus, there is a strong need to perform VIV analyses for different staggered buoyancy element configurations in terms of the riser fatigue performance. The riser may oscillate in both Cross-Flow (CF) and In-Line (IL) directions. Most of the riser VIV analyses have been performed in pure CF motions since it was assumed that the IL response’s contribution to fatigue damage is insignificant compared to CF one. However, it has been indicated that the IL fatigue damage becomes significant for long cylindrical structures (Baarholm et al., 2006). Thus, in order to consider the contribution from the IL, CF responses and also from their combinations, the VIV analysis including combined CF and IL motions should be performed. In this thesis, based on the experimentally obtained hydrodynamic data, three different SLWR configurations have been built and analyzed using the VIV prediction program VIVANA. Since the vortex shedding frequency behavior around the structure is uncertain, there are two options to determine the excitation zones used in this program. Their principles are based on the following assumptions: frequencies act on the structure concurrently (space sharing option) or consequently (time sharing option). With reference to the above mentioned, the following analyses have been performed in the present work: •	Investigation of sensitivity of different buoyancy element configurations on the CF fatigue damage; •	Investigation of the combined CF and IL prediction for the base case configuration; •	Investigation of the space sharing and time sharing options for all configurations. As a result, all the analyses have been successfully performed; some key findings are listed below: •	The sensitivity analysis results have shown an insufficient fatigue performance of two SLWR configurations with staggered buoyancy elements due to the high bending stresses in the buoyancy sections; •	In the base case VIV analysis with combined CF and IL motions (using both uniform and sheared current profiles), the fatigue damage calculated at 45, 135 and 180 (IL) degrees to the flow direction was dominating for some of the cases; •	The fatigue damage results obtained using the space sharing option, have been generally bigger compared to the time sharing case. In the present work, all obtained results have been stated and discussed; recommendations for further work have been also given...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2006. The axial {{valley of}} the Endeavour Segment (Juan de Fuca Ridge) is a region of intense {{hydrothermal}} activity that supports an exotic chemosynthetic ecosystem. Previous studies of circulation {{in the region have}} mostly focused on levels above the valley and near the rise height of high-temperature (> 300 °C) effluent from focused sources to obtain an integrated measure of heat and chemical fluxes into the deep ocean. However, it is thought that a large portion of hydrothermal heating is attributable to lower-temperature (5 [...] 50 °C) buoyant fluid that emanates from diffuse hydrothermal sources and equilibrates at levels within the valley. Additionally, the largest concentrations of vent organisms and their larvae are found within the bottom meters of the axial valley. The intent of this thesis is to characterize the flow and hydrography from the level of neutral buoyancy of the high temperature plumes, down through the axial valley and into the bottom boundary layer (BBL) and contribute to the understanding of transport processes that pray be involved in the near-bottom dispersal of larvae or diffuse hydrothermal effluent. This is done primarily through analysis of several observational data sets consisting of point measurements of flow, temperature, and turbulent heat and momentum fluxes; timeseries of velocity profiles within the valley; and high resolution cross/along valley sections of flow and hydrography that extend up to the level of neutral buoyancy. Flow-topography interaction along with convective hydrothermal plumes yield a very dynamic environment. Within the BBL, currents are spatially heterogeneous and turbulence is generated by a combination of shear and buoyancy that depends on the phase of the tide and the relative distance from buoyancy sources. Above the BBL, within the valley, and at a site away from hydrothermal vents, subinertial flows are intensified and re-aligned along valley towards the bottom. This is consistent with solutions from a quasianalytic model for subinertial motions, which shows attenuation of cross-valley flow with depth. Beneath the level of neutral <b>buoyancy,</b> <b>sections</b> of hydrography and velocity reveal structures related to rising high-temperature plumes superposed on across and along valley density gradients that are thought {{to play a role in}} driving along-valley currents...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to optimise the performance of an initial Steel Lazy Wave Riser (SLWR) configuration {{with regards to the}} combined loading criteria in the Offshore Standard DNV-OS-F 201 : Dynamic Risers. This is done by conducting large scale parameter variations for the configuration using the programming interface in the OrcaFlex analysis software. The study considers the implementation of SLWRs in ultra-deep waters, in conjunction with a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel. Being connected to a spread moored FPSO in a water depth of 2800 meters, the riser configurations are analysed for typical extreme environmental conditions found in the Santos basin off the coast of Brazil. By analysing the vessel response for different 100 -year waves, the worst conditions are determined in terms of the largest downward velocities experienced at hang-off point. These parameters are used in combination with a 10 -year current to study the extreme response behaviour for the different configurations analysed. From the design basis, an initial SLWR configuration is established and it is verified that it meets the stated design criteria for combined loading and the wave induced fatigue. This configuration is then subjected to parameter variations by altering the hang-off angle, total net buoyancy force and length of <b>buoyancy</b> <b>section.</b> A total of 75 different configurations are created and analysed under extreme environmental conditions to determine a better configuration in terms of the combined loading utilisation. The findings are presented and a comparison of selected configurations are given to better understand the effect of the parameter variations. The optimisation results show that all the configurations meet the Ultimate Limit State (ULS) design criteria, and that the maximum utilisation experienced in the different cases varies significantly. With tension being the main contributor for the combined loading in these water depths, it is found that a combination of reduced hang-off angle and increased net buoyancy force will improve the performance of the configuration. From the optimisation study, the best configuration is determined and assessed for wave induced fatigue life. The fatigue results show an increase in fatigue life, which also reflects the importance of reducing the top tension. The work presented in this thesis provides information on how different parameters for a SLWR in ultra-deep water affects the combined loading utilisation, and it is proven that this concept is feasible for use in conjunction with a FPSO in these water depths...|$|E
40|$|The arched {{equilibrium}} {{path of a}} thin {{magnetic flux}} tube in a plane-stratified, nonmagnetic atmosphere is calculated for {{cases in which the}} flux tube contains a steady siphon flow. The large scale mechanical equilibrium of the flux tube involves a balance among the magnetic buoyancy force, the net magnetic tension force due to the curvature of the flux tube axis, and the inertial (centrifugal) force due to the siphon flow along curved streamlines. The ends of the flux tube are assumed to be pinned down by some other external force. Both isothermal and adiabatic siphon flows are considered for flux tubes in an isothermal external atmosphere. For the isothermal case, {{in the absence of a}} siphon flow the equilibrium path reduces to the static arch calculated by Parker (1975, 1979). The presence of a siphon flow causes the flux tube arch to bend more sharply, so that magnetic tension can overcome the additional straightening effect of the inertial force, and reduces the maximum width of the arch. The curvature of the arch increases as the siphon flow speed increases. For a critical siphon flow, with supercritical flow in the downstream leg, the arch is asymmetric, with greater curvature in the downstream leg of the arch. Adiabatic flow have qualitatively similar effects, except that adiabatic cooling reduces the buoyancy of the flux tube and thus leads to significantly wider arches. In some cases the cooling is strong enough to create negative <b>buoyancy</b> along <b>sections</b> of the flux tube, requiring upward curvature of the flux tube path along these sections and sometimes leading to unusual equilibrium paths of periodic, sinusoidal form...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} measurements {{has been conducted}} in order to investigate the bubble behaviours through the horizontal pipe line of the domestic wet central heating systems. Obtained results exposed the effect of 90 degree bend, buoyancy forces on bubbly two phase flow patterns and effect of velocity on void fractions and bubble diameters. Distance chosen for the first sight glass (HSG 0) was sufficient enough to note the effect of 90 degree bend on void fraction patterns. Due {{to the effect of}} 90 degree bend, position of the peak void fractions across the pipe section lowers, with an increase in bulk fluid velocity. Bubbles tend to flow for longer distance {{at the bottom of the}} pipe <b>section.</b> <b>Buoyancy</b> force effect is demonstrated with figures for highest bulk fluid velocity at three different positions. Analysis of four different flow rates at two different saturation ratios show reduction for average bubble diameters and void fractions when bulk fluid velocity increases. An attempt to predict bubble dissolution rates across the horizontal pipeline of the system is made, however results show some uncertainties...|$|R
40|$|This chapter gives {{a survey}} on the {{rheology}} of multiphase systems. The topic {{is of the}} utmost practical relevance, as flows of multiphase systems, e. g., solids in liquid, liquid-liquid or gas-liquid systems are encountered in a very wide range of applications. It is then evident {{the difficult task of}} gathering together sparse results while also unifying concepts and interpretations. We were thus forced to make a severe selection of main topics, and to leave out many arguments which, though interesting, appear to be of less general relevance. We are fully aware that such a selection is certainly biased from our own interests and fields of expertise; although we apologize for this anisotropic point of view, we believe this is unavoidable in any review chapter. The chapter opens with a section devoted to suspensions of solids in liquids. In order to maintain the discussion as simple as possible, we consider the case of identical solid spheres as inclusions, by neglecting inertia and <b>buoyancy.</b> The <b>section</b> progresses from dilute to “dense” suspensions. The second section reports on the rheology of liquid-liquid suspensions, i. e., emulsions. The relevance of the dynamic nature of the interface is stressed throughout, from the disperse to the co-continuous morphology. Deformability of the interface, together with breakup and coalescence phenomena play the central role under flow. The chapter then closes with a rather brief introduction to foams, i. e., the case of gas-liquid systems at very high gas fraction. Whenever theoretical analysis can be profitably used to describe experimental evidences, it has been included in some detail. The reader will notice how theoretical understanding progressively fade out while reaching the end of the chapter, somehow reflecting both the age of the subjects here addressed, and their intrinsic difficulties. Although the topics covered in this chapter are widespread, a unifying tool is often used (if not explicitly reported) for the rheological description, namely, the celebrated stress averaging procedure formalized by Batchelor (1970). Useful limiting behaviors and scaling arguments are presented as well. In the cases where no clear cut understanding can be found, phenomenological arguments and practical rules of thumb are reported to guide the reade...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{buoyancy}} forces {{acting on the}} hearth coke bed or the “deadman” of the blast furnace has attracted {{a great deal of}} interest during recent years of blast furnace research. This thesis presents an effort to elucidate the particle movement patterns connected to formation of a coke free layer in the hearth. In the work, the impact of different pressure distributions on the behaviour of the particle bed was studied with an experimental 3 D-cold blast furnace hearth model. The bases for the work were the results from tests along with two different numerical models from a previous study, Hearth coke bed buoyancy, a preliminary investigation, made in 2004 at Bluescope Steel Research, Port Kembla, Australia. In the model, a bed of plastic particles in water were subjected to different pressure distributions, and float-sink motions induced by accumulation and drainage of the water through a valve in the bottom. The results showed that the bed was quite resistant to internal particle movements, when subjected to different linear pressure distributions along the radius. However, previous studies have suggested the downward pressure under the raceways to be severely reduced, and when going below 15 : 85 in pressure ratio between the peripheral and central area, it was observed that the particles moved internally. As the central load was descending in the bed, upward particle movements were observed along the walls, {{as well as from the}} centre towards the walls on the bottom. Particle movements were strongly dependent on the sink-float motions, and moved relative to one another only during drainage, when particles under the central weight moved down faster than under the peripheral reduced pressure area. This mechanism resulted in formation of a peripheral free space in the bottom of the hearth. Addition of an agglomerate of particles to the bottom of the particle bed, resulted in less particle movements and retarded formation of the peripheral free space. Initially it was intended to carry out these tests also numerically using Bluescope Steel’s particle simulation package DPSim. Because of problems with validating DPSim for the application with float-sink motions induced by <b>buoyancy</b> forces, this <b>section</b> was constrained to a sensitivity analysis on the program. The study showed that the float-sink behaviour of the particle bed was insensitive to friction parameter adjustments in the tested range. It was also discovered that the assigned simulation time was of significant importance. This indicates that the common practise of reducing the runtime may not be valid for this application.
