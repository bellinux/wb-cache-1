5|$|Many {{extensive}} {{areas of}} Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) {{are on the}} site. Heritage stations of common <b>butterbur</b> and hart's-tongue fern, colonized by invasive species, are managed by manual removal and disposal for incineration.|$|E
5|$|Manual {{removal of}} the Japanese {{knotweed}} has preserved heritage stations of common <b>butterbur</b> and hart's-tongue fern. Early hand pruning was conducive to orchids. The late mowing seems rather ineffective. The grubbing-up of the Canada golden-rod and American asters was successful. The bush clearing and selective logging have helped maintain the wood-fringe with narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and liquorice milkvetch. Common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid, species non-adapted to open areas, benefited areas without clearing. The low dry-stone walls probably favored the installation of viviparous lizard or common wall lizard, observed in 2013, but also the consolidation of the hart's-tongue fern population.|$|E

50|$|Petasites is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} sunflower family, Asteraceae, that are {{commonly referred to as}} <b>butterburs</b> and coltsfoots. They are perennial plants with thick, creeping underground rhizomes and large rhubarb-like leaves during the growing season.|$|R
5|$|Twelve of {{them were}} {{inventoried}} in 2003, and their populations have been managed since. The light undergrowth contains common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii) and round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia). Liquorice milkvetch (Astragalus glycyphyllos) and narrow-leaved everlasting-pea (Lathyrus sylvestris) {{are present in the}} small herb glade. The population of lesser butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) is located in the pioneer wood. In the glade with Calamagrostide and at the boundary of a pioneer grove grow pyramidal orchid (Anacamptis pyramidalis). bee orchid (Ophrys apifera) and man orchid (Orchis anthropophora) grow everywhere, except in the older glade. In the different herbaceous fringes grow wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) and zigzag clover (Trifolium medium). A tall herb fringe hosts common <b>butterbur</b> (Petasites hybridus).|$|E
5|$|The {{preservation}} of the existing diversity {{was the most important}} goal. It required conservation of the heritage plant communities: tall-herb fen with common <b>butterbur,</b> the chasmophytic vegetation with hart's-tongue fern and the woody fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli. The survival of populations of round-leaved wintergreen and of man orchid, the two most interesting plants, was also a priority, as a strikeout against brush invasion in the open areas where bee orchid and pyramidal orchid grow. The natural forest dynamics are to be contained within areas of clear undergrowth or fringes with these species: common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid. Pioneer areas with mushrooms should be preserved and the invasive species contained. Artificial infrastructures (ruin, concrete pylons, walls and rock piles) should be utilized for the creation of new habitats.|$|E
25|$|Fornost {{fell into}} ruin {{following}} {{the end of}} Arthedain and {{came to be known as}} Deadmen's Dike. Gandalf indicated to Barliman <b>Butterbur</b> that Fornost would probably be rebuilt by King Elessar.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a common}} species. It is a bee of alpine and subarctic climates. It lives in open, grassy habitat such as {{mountain}} meadows. It nests underground, or sometimes on the surface. Its food plants include sandworts, rabbitbrush, fireweeds, lupines, coyote mints, <b>butterburs,</b> mountain heathers, and groundsels.|$|R
25|$|The {{worn-out}} {{fabric of}} old clothing {{was used for}} baby clothes because soft cloth {{was good for the}} skin of babies and worn-out material protected babies from gods of illness and demons due to these gods' abhorrence of dirty things. Before a baby was breast-fed, he/she was given a decoction of the endodermis of alder and the roots of <b>butterburs</b> to discharge impurities. Children were raised almost naked until about the ages of four to five. Even when they wore clothes, they did not wear belts and left the front of their clothes open. Subsequently, they wore bark clothes without patterns, such as attush, until coming of age.|$|R

25|$|Outside the Shire, Gandalf {{encountered}} Radagast the Brown, {{another of}} the Istari, who brought {{the news that the}} Nazgûl had ridden forth and crossed the River Anduin—and a request from Saruman that Gandalf come to Isengard. Gandalf left a letter to Frodo (urging his immediate departure) with Barliman <b>Butterbur</b> at the inn in Bree, and headed towards Isengard. There Saruman revealed his true colours, urging Gandalf to help him obtain the Ring for his own use. Gandalf refused, and Saruman imprisoned him {{at the top of the}} tower of Orthanc. Eventually Gandalf was rescued by Gwaihir the Eagle.|$|E
25|$|In the inn, Pippin has {{too much}} to drink and begins to tell stories about Bilbo. Afraid that he will reveal too much, Frodo climbs on a table and begins to sing and dance to {{distract}} the crowd. However, he slips, and the Ring lands on his finger, turning him invisible. An angry ranger takes the hobbits into another room, warning them they are drawing too much attention to themselves. He introduces himself as Strider (Daran Norris) and asks if he may join them on their journey. At this point, the innkeeper, Barliman <b>Butterbur</b> (Daran Norris), arrives with a letter from Gandalf which informs Frodo that Strider is really Aragorn, a trusted friend. Attracted by Frodo's accidental use of the Ring, the Nazgûl come to Bree, but Aragorn successfully hides the hobbits.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. Now {{these great}} two orders--of which the types are the thyme and the daisy--you are to {{remember}} generally as the 'Herbs' and the 'Sunflowers.' You {{are not to}} call them Lipped flowers, nor Composed flowers; because {{the first is a}} vulgar term; for when you once come to be able to draw a lip, or, in noble duty, to kiss one, you will know that no other flower in earth is like that: and the second is an indefinite term; for a foxglove is as much a 'composed' flower as a daisy; but it is composed {{in the shape of a}} spire, instead of the shape of the sun. And again a thistle, which common botany calls a composed flower, as well as a daisy, is composed in quite another shape, being on the whole, bossy instead of flat; and of another temper, or composition of mind, also, being connected in that respect with <b>butterburs,</b> and a vast company of rough, knotty, half-black or brown, and generally unluminous--flowers I can scarcely call them--and weeds I will not,--creatures, at all events, in nowise to be gathered under the general name 'Composed,' with the stars that crown Chaucer's Alcestis, when she returns to the day from the dead.|$|R
25|$|Many of {{the water}} meadows are rich in pignut (Conopodium majus), a {{relative}} of parsley, which formed a breaktime snack for children in former times. The plant is dug up to harvest a small potato-like structure that, eaten raw, has a slightly nutty taste. It is available commercially for salads, etc. Hemlock water dropwort grows well in the wetter areas and is best left alone as the name hemlock suggests. The large leaves of the <b>butterbur</b> (Petasites hybridus) are found in several areas; its name harkens {{back to the days}} before clingfilm or cheap paper when the leaves were used to wrap butter destined for the market. Water ragwort (or Saracen's ragwort) (a species of Senecio) is an introduced plant that grows along the Garnock in tall stands. Although it is common on the Garnock and at present quite rare elsewhere. Himalayan balsam or policemen's helmets is another introduction, but a common one. Giant hogweed is beginning to make its presence felt. It is another plant that should never be handled, as the sap can cause severe blistering and scarring of the skin.|$|E

2500|$|In The Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo Baggins met Strider (Aragorn) at {{the largest}} and most popular inn in Bree, The Prancing Pony, owned by Barliman <b>Butterbur.</b> The hobbits also {{returned}} to Bree in The Return of the King on their way home.

2500|$|The role of Barliman <b>Butterbur</b> at the Prancing Pony {{is largely}} removed for time and {{dramatic}} flow.

It behoved to lie close and keep silent. But the sand of the little isle was sun-warm, the green plants gave us shelter for our heads, we had food and drink in plenty; and to crown all, we were within sight of safety.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Butterbur</b> {{has been}} used for over 2000 years to treat a variety of ailments {{including}} fever, lung disease, spasms, and pain. Currently, <b>butterbur</b> extract is used for migraine prevention and treatment of allergic rhinitis, which have the most evidence for its effectiveness. Some <b>butterbur</b> species contain the chemicals petasin and isopetasin which are believed to have potential benefits in treating migraines. [...] High concentrations of petasin occur in both <b>butterbur</b> root and leaves, with the leaves containing lower levels of the toxic chemical. <b>Butterbur</b> extracts have been reported to be effective in reducing frequency and severity of migraine headaches. Several double-blind studies have shown that high doses of Petasites hybridus" [...] extract, containing petasin and/or isopetasin, are effective both in preventing and in relieving migraine, with the best results in groups taking the higher dose of the supplement. Although mainly well-tolerated, the adverse effects of <b>butterbur</b> reported in clinical trials include mainly gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, flatulence, and belching. The American Academy of Neurology and American Headache Society now endorse <b>butterbur</b> for preventing migraine headaches with a Level A recommendation (based on at least two strong clinical trials).
