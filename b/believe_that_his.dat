5|$|In September 1847 Busch began {{studying}} {{mechanical engineering at}} Hanover Polytechnic. Busch's biographers are not in agreement as to why his Hanover education ended; most <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> father had little appreciation of his son's artistic inclination. Biographer Eva Weissweiler suspects that Kleine played a major role, and that other possible causes were Busch's friendship with an innkeeper, Brümmer, political debates in Brümmer's tavern, and Busch's reluctance to believe every word of the Bible and catechism.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} the election, the lame-duck session of the old 67th Congress met. Harding had come to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> early view of the presidency—that it should propose policies, but leave whether to adopt them to Congress—was not enough, and he lobbied Congress, {{although}} in vain, to get his ship subsidy bill through. Once Congress left town in early March 1923, Harding's popularity in the country began to recover. The economy was improving, and the programs of Harding's more able cabinet members, such as Hughes, Mellon, and Hoover, were showing results. Most Republicans {{realized that there was}} no practical alternative to supporting Harding in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Before long, it {{was noted}} that there were {{discrepancies}} between Audisio's original story published in L'Unità, subsequent versions that he provided and the versions of events provided by others. Although his account most probably is built around the facts, it was certainly embellished. The discrepancies and obvious exaggerations, coupled with the belief that the Communist Party had selected him to claim responsibility for their own political purposes, led some in Italy to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> story was wholly or largely untrue.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of Shackleton's near miss, Captain Scott {{organised}} the Terra Nova Expedition, 1910–13, in which securing the South Pole for the British Empire was an explicitly stated prime objective. As he planned his expedition, Scott {{saw no reason to}} <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> effort would be contested. However, the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who had been developing plans for a North Pole expedition, changed his mind when, in September 1909, the North Pole was claimed in quick succession by the Americans Frederick Cook and Robert Peary. Amundsen resolved to go south instead.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tracy {{begins to}} {{question}} the reason why his sons want to {{spend so much time}} with him. One day, Tracy sees a special about Lyle and Erik Menendez—the two brothers who became famous for killing their parents—which leads him to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> sons are plotting to kill him. As a result, Tracy buys a life-Japanese sex doll that looks like him to use as a decoy to fool them. Eventually, Tracy realizes that he overreacted with his sons but warns his son, Tracy Jr. (Bobb'e J. Thompson), that if he were to die, that he and his brother will face jail time.|$|E
5|$|Political and {{religious}} differences between old Missourians and newly-arriving Mormon settlers provoked {{tensions between the}} two groups, much as they had years earlier in Jackson County. By this time, Smith's experiences with mob violence led him to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> faith's survival required greater militancy against anti-Mormons. Around June 1838, recent convert Sampson Avard formed a covert organization called the Danites to intimidate Mormon dissenters and oppose anti-Mormon militia units. Though {{it is unclear how}} much Smith knew of the Danites' activities, he clearly approved of those of which he did know. After Rigdon delivered a sermon that implied dissenters had no place in the Mormon community, the Danites forcibly expelled them from the county.|$|E

5|$|The motive behind Edward's {{change of}} heart could have been purely pragmatic; Montfort was in a good {{position}} to support his cause in Gascony. When the King left for France in November, Edward's behaviour turned into pure insubordination. He made several appointments to advance the cause of the reformers, causing his father to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> son was considering a coup d'état. When the King returned from France, he initially refused to see his son, but through the mediation of the Earl of Cornwall and the Archbishop of Canterbury, the two were eventually reconciled. Edward was sent abroad, and in November 1260 he again united with the Lusignans, who had been exiled to France.|$|E
5|$|At {{a luncheon}} later that day, however, Miranda announces {{that it is}} Jacqueline instead of Nigel who will leave Runway for Holt. Nigel remarks to a stunned Andy that, though disappointed, he has to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> loyalty to Miranda will one day pay off. Later, when Miranda and Andy are being driven to a show, she {{explains}} to a still-stunned Andy that she {{was grateful for the}} warning but already knew of the plot to replace her and sacrificed Nigel to keep her own job. Pleased by this display of loyalty, she tells Andy that she sees a great deal of herself in her. Andy, repulsed, says she could never do that to anyone. Miranda replies that she already did, stepping over Emily when she agreed to go to Paris. When they stop, Andy gets out and throws her cell phone into the fountain of the Place de la Concorde, leaving Miranda, Runway, and fashion behind.|$|E
5|$|Born in Preston, {{he began}} playing {{football}} {{at a young}} age, taking inspiration from his father who played semi-professionally. Carlisle represented his home county of Lancashire at youth level. The start of his professional career was his Football League debut for Blackpool in September 1997. He moved to Queens Park Rangers in May 2000. In the same year, Carlisle won three caps for the England under-21 national team. He missed a number of matches for Queens Park Rangers due to a posterior cruciate ligament injury which at one stage led doctors to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> career was over. He then missed one month of the 2003–04 season because of an alcohol-related problem, and left Queens Park Rangers {{at the end of}} that season. In the summer of 2004, he joined Leeds United on a free transfer.|$|E

5|$|John Appleyard had profited {{in terms}} of offices and annuities from his brother-in-law's rise ever since 1559; he was {{nevertheless}} disappointed with what he had got from Robert Dudley, now Earl of Leicester. In 1567 he was approached, apparently {{on behalf of the}} Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Sussex, to accuse Leicester of the murder of his wife for a reward of £1,000 in cash. He refused to cooperate in the plot, although he had, he said, {{in the last few years}} come to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> half-sister was murdered. He had always been convinced of Dudley's innocence but thought it would be an easy matter to find out the real culprits. He said he had repeatedly asked for the Earl's help to this effect, claiming the jury had not yet come up with their verdict; Dudley had always answered that the matter should rest, since a jury had found that there was no murder, by due procedure of law. Now, as Leicester became aware of a plot against him, he summoned Appleyard and sent him away after a furious confrontation.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a casting}} {{department}} at Elstree Studios which casts actors for Holby City {{as well as}} Casualty, EastEnders and Doctors. The programme also has two dedicated casting directors who bring in a shortlist of actors for the producer and director to audition. Some cast members who play main characters have made previous appearances in Holby City in minor roles. Mealing appeared {{as the mother of}} a paediatric patient in the show's fourth series, Roberts appeared as the son of a medical professor in Holby City seventh series, and Dhillon appeared as anaesthetist Sunil Gupta in 2001. Roberts believes that his single scene in series seven was enough for him to be called in for the part of Joseph, while in contrast, Dhillon does not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> role contributed to his casting as Michael, but instead worried that it would work against him.|$|E
5|$|Dowie {{recommended}} Carlisle to Queens Park Rangers manager Gerry Francis, {{who paid}} a transfer fee of £250,000 to sign him on 25 May 2000. He played his first {{match for the}} team on 12 August 2000 in the 0–0 draw with Birmingham City at Loftus Road. He made a further 31 appearances in the 2000–01 season and scored three times, earning himself a call-up to the England national under-21 team. However, his season was cut short on 31 January 2001, when he suffered his first major injury after a tackle by Rufus Brevett during the 2–0 defeat to Fulham. It was found that Carlisle had torn his posterior cruciate ligament, an injury which kept him sidelined {{for a year and}} caused doctors to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> career might be over. While he was out of action, Queens Park Rangers suffered relegation to the Second Division after finishing 23rd in the league. Soon after the injury he attempted suicide, and years later was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Upon his return to football, Carlisle was injured again in a reserve-team match against Bristol City, sparking fears that he had aggravated his previous injury. The damage proved not to be particularly severe, although it delayed his return to training by a further month.|$|E

5|$|Vargas Llosa {{lived with}} his {{maternal}} family in Arequipa until a year after his parents' divorce, when his maternal grandfather was named honorary consul for Peru in Bolivia. With his mother and her family, Vargas Llosa then moved to Cochabamba, Bolivia, where he spent {{the early years of}} his childhood. His maternal family, the Llosas, were sustained by his grandfather, who managed a cotton farm. As a child, Vargas Llosa was led to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> father had died—his mother and her family did not want to explain that his parents had separated. During the government of Peruvian President José Bustamante y Rivero, Vargas Llosa's maternal grandfather obtained a diplomatic post in the northern Peruvian coastal city of Piura and the entire family returned to Peru. While in Piura, Vargas Llosa attended elementary school at the religious academy Colegio Salesiano. In 1946, at the age of ten, he moved to Lima and met his father for the first time. His parents re-established their relationship and lived in Magdalena del Mar, a middle-class Lima suburb, during his teenage years. While in Lima, he studied at the Colegio La Salle, a Christian middle school, from 1947 to 1949.|$|E
