5|$|Typical to {{variations}} of the Irenaean theodicy {{is the notion that}} the present world is the greatest possible world, or the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds.</b> This is based on the Irenaean idea of human development, suggesting that the best possible world would be best suited to human development: a world containing evil and suffering would allow development better than one which does not, so the world is considered the best possible world.|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a Christian theodicy {{designed}} {{to respond to}} the problem of evil. As such, it defends the probability of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.|$|E
25|$|Plenitude. Leibniz {{believed}} that the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> would actualize every genuine possibility, and argued in Théodicée that this <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> will contain all possibilities, with our finite experience of eternity giving no reason to dispute nature's perfection.|$|E

25|$|To {{avoid the}} {{unhappiness}} of aimless desire, the Will realizes the ideas already potentially {{present and the}} Unconscious becomes actual. The existence {{of the universe is}} the result, then, of the illogical Will, but its characteristics and laws are all due to the Idea or Reason and are, therefore, logical. It is the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds,</b> which contains the promise of the redemption of the Unconscious from actual existence by the exercise of Reason in partnership with the Will in the consciousness of the enlightened pessimist.|$|E

2500|$|Patrick Suppes 1957 (1999 Dover edition), Introduction to Logic, Dover Publications, Inc., Mineola, New York. [...] (pbk.). This book is {{in print}} and readily available. Suppes's §8.5 The Problem of Division by Zero begins this way: [...] "That {{everything}} {{is not for the}} best in this <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds,</b> even in mathematics, is well illustrated by the vexing problem of defining the operation of division in the elementary theory of arithmetic" [...] (p.163). In his §8.7 Five Approaches to Division by Zero he remarks that [...] "...there is no uniformly satisfactory solution" [...] (p.166) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{a book by}} Voltaire. There's a {{character}} in it called Doctor Pangloss, who thought that everything was for the best in this <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds." ...|$|R

60|$|I walked {{towards him}} serenely {{confident}} that he would hand it over to me, and that all was for {{the best in the}} <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{not here}} to asseverate that I know the fact, of my own knowledge,' {{answered}} Pangloss, 'but I have grounds for asserting that the stores were the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> stores.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{believe them}} {{the best in the}} <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds," [...] I said, devoutly; and it struck me that, if ever we came to have a {{national}} church, some such affirmation as that concerning our economical conditions ought to be in the confession of faith.|$|R
50|$|Lawrence Bingham (Richard O'Sullivan), a brilliant, but {{arrogant and}} irritating doctor who {{believes}} he is the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> doctors. He marries the equally obnoxious Dr. Mary Parsons (Helen Fraser) in the series Doctor in Charge. His need to continually impress her {{is the source of}} much comedy.|$|R
60|$|I {{crushed the}} letter in my hand, and sat staring at it, my pigsty in ruins about my ears, {{face to face with}} the fact that, even in a <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds,</b> money will not buy everything.|$|E
60|$|This last {{aspect of}} the matter was speedily brought to my notice, which till then it had escaped, by a letter from her, handed to me one night at the club, where I was sipping coffee and musing on the {{excellence}} of life in this <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right. Never be a pessimist. Everything is for {{the best}} in this <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds.</b> It's a long lane that has no turning. It s always darkest before the dawn. Have {{patience}} and all will come right. The sun will shine, although the day's a grey one.... Try some of this salad." ...|$|E
2500|$|Piper's {{soteriology}} is Calvinist, and his ecclesiology is Baptist. [...] He {{affirms the}} distinctively Calvinist doctrine of double predestination, which includes [...] "unconditional reprobation" [...] or damnation as a corollary to the Augustinian doctrine of unconditional election, and he subscribes to the Leibnizian view that God decreed this universe {{to be the}} <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> universes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder whether}} you will forgive me, {{when you are}} {{informed}} of the circumstances? It is a sad little story; but I am vain enough to think that my part in it will interest you. I have been a vain man, since that brightest and <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> days when you first made your confession--when {{you said that you}} loved me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{there is}} the tone elevated, diffusive, and interjectional. Some <b>of</b> our <b>best</b> novelists patronize this tone. The words must be all in a whirl, like a humming-top, and make a noise very similar, which answers remarkably well instead of meaning. This is the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> styles where the writer is in too great a hurry to think.|$|R
6000|$|It {{would be}} the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> if {{everybody}} would only follow our advice. I wonder, would Jerusalem have been the cleanly city it is reported, if, instead of troubling himself concerning his own twopenny-halfpenny doorstep, each citizen had gone out into the road and given eloquent lectures {{to all the other}} inhabitants on the subject of sanitation? ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time since the {{delirium}} of marriage had seized upon him, Kirk was conscious of a feeling that all was not for the best in a <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds,</b> a feeling of regret, not that he had married--the mere thought would have been a blasphemy--but that marriage was such a complicated affair. He liked a calm life, free from complications, and now they were springing up on every side.|$|E
60|$|What Lord Emsworth remembered was this: Late in the {{previous}} autumn the next estate to Blandings had been rented by an American, a Mr. Peters--a man with many millions, chronic dyspepsia, and one fair daughter--Aline. The two families had met. Freddie and Aline had been thrown together; and, {{only a few days}} before, the engagement had been announced. And for Lord Emsworth the only flaw in this <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> had been removed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{statement}} that [...] "we {{live in the}} <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds" [...] drew scorn, most notably from Voltaire, who lampooned it in his comic novella Candide by having the character Dr. Pangloss (a parody of Leibniz and Maupertuis) repeat it like a mantra. From this, the adjective [...] "" [...] describes a person who believes that the world about us is the best possible one.|$|R
5000|$|The idea of {{possible}} worlds is most commonly attributed to Gottfried Leibniz, who spoke {{of possible}} worlds as {{ideas in the}} mind of God and used the notion to argue that our actually created world must be [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds". Arthur Schopenhauer argued that on the contrary our world must be the worst <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds, because if it were only a little worse it could not continue to exist.|$|R
2500|$|Robinson claimed {{not much}} {{happens on the}} program apart {{from a lot of}} phone calls with little substance, {{consisting}} only of lengthy discussions about wombats, curlews, white-tailed spiders and mopokes. [...] Robinson also claimed that it was easy for the program to cater to [...] "One Nation types", by telling them their world of nice, bland, decent folk is the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possibles</b> because they considered change an abomination.|$|R
60|$|It is {{a relief}} to turn from the contemplation of these {{tortured}} souls to the pleasanter picture presented by Lord Marshmoreton. Here, undeniably, we have a man without a secret sorrow, a man at peace with this <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds.</b> Since his visit to George a second youth seems to have come upon Lord Marshmoreton. He works in his rose-garden with a new vim, whistling or even singing to himself stray gay snatches of melodies popular in the 'eighties.|$|E
60|$|This Club was of an {{inclusive}} and intersocial character; to a degree, indeed, remarkable {{for the part}} of England in which it had its being--dear, delightful Wessex, whose statuesque dynasties are even now only just beginning to feel the shaking of the new and strange spirit without, like that which entered the lonely valley of Ezekiel's vision and made the dry bones move: where the honest squires, tradesmen, parsons, clerks, and people still praise the Lord with one voice for His <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds.</b>|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth {{met him in}} the passage. At the age {{of eleven}} or thereabouts women acquire a poise {{and an ability to}} handle {{difficult}} situations which a man, if he is lucky, manages to achieve somewhere in the later seventies. Except for a pallor strange to her face and a drawn look about her eyes, there was nothing to show that all was not for the best with Elizabeth in a <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> <b>worlds.</b> If she did not look jaunty, she at least looked composed. She greeted Bill with a smile.|$|E
5000|$|In Vitanza's recent work, he {{challenges}} Leibniz's foundational {{example of}} using Sextus's rape of Lucretia to ground a conception <b>of</b> [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> worlds." [...] Extending Deleuze's re-reading of Leibniz in The Fold and Agamben's sense of [...] "decreation," [...] Vitanza seeks {{after all the}} denegated incompossibilities that result when [...] "what happened and what did not happen are returned to their originary unity" [...] (Agamben's Potentialities 270).|$|R

6000|$|Captain Bennydeck {{started to}} his feet. [...] "I am ashamed of having intruded on you," [...] he began. His new friend pressed {{him back into}} his chair without ceremony. [...] "On the contrary, you have arrived at the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>possible</b> times--the time when our {{suspense}} is at an end. The doctor has just told us that his poor little patient is out of danger. You may imagine how happy we are." ...|$|R
