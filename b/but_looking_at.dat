2500|$|On July 1, 2003, Twiztid {{released}} {{their third}} studio album and seventh overall album, The Green Book. Spaniolo {{has referred to}} the album as a [...] "Juggalo favorite". Allmusic reviewer Rob Theakston panned the album, writing that it [...] "is much, {{much better than the}} last ICP card record, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the forest from the trees, that really isn't saying much anymore." [...] The Green Book peaked at number 2 on the Top Independent Charts and number 52 on the Billboard 200. Twiztid released their third EP and eighth overall album titled Fright Fest '03 at their Fright Fest 2003 show.|$|E
60|$|<b>But,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> him, she {{instantly}} perceived {{how he had}} misunderstood her.|$|E
60|$|The other made no reply, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> him for {{the first}} time, {{surveyed}} him with a troubled expression.|$|E
60|$|She started, {{and altered}} her position, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him dubiously.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy said nothing, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} hard, {{questioning}} eyes.|$|R
30|$|Kibong answers no word <b>but</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> {{the east}} side and left.|$|R
60|$|I {{thought his}} tone sounded sorrowful, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> him, I saw his kind face lighted up by its pleasantest smile.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When Mr Lightwood saw me, my love,' {{observed}} her husband, not avoiding his eye, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> him, 'my {{name was}} Julius Handford.' ...|$|E
60|$|He did {{not finish}} the sentence, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Ailie with a gaze of agony, he pressed her {{more closely to}} his breast.|$|E
60|$|Gui. Judge not too rashly of the Holy League, <b>But</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> home.|$|R
60|$|Jefferson said nothing, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Austin, {{who knew}} {{he must be}} quiet.|$|R
60|$|As Ada said nothing, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me, I said {{it must be}} very gratifying.|$|R
6000|$|He {{eyed her}} gloomily--remorsefully I thought--for an instant; and said, {{turning his head}} towards me, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> my feet instead of my face: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{the firemen}} have a knack {{of doing that}} sort of thing," [...] said I, {{speaking}} to Mrs McTougall, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Lilly Blythe.|$|E
6000|$|Maud wondered, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Voyt, [...] "They're shown often, no doubt, as {{paying for}} their badness. But are they shown as paying for their romance?" ...|$|E
60|$|Bertha {{did not say}} anything, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} eyes wide open with surprise.|$|R
60|$|Bowers did not reply, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{his friend}} with an {{expression}} of puzzled surprise.|$|R
60|$|She ceased speaking, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me with {{a strange}} new light coming into her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "We all use it?" [...] she {{repeated}} after me, vaguely, not coming {{close to the}} window <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> my shoes. She appeared to think me capable of throwing her out.|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh my dear child!” Mrs. Lemon wailed, {{addressing}} {{her young}} visitor, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her son, who {{on his side}} looked at the ceiling, at the floor, looked above all very conscious.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Are they, though!' said Pancks. 'I shouldn't {{have thought}} it.' Not {{in the least}} looking at them, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Little Dorrit. 'Perhaps you wonder who I am. Shall I tell you? I am a fortune-teller.' ...|$|E
60|$|Dick did not speak, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the lumberman {{with a dark}} {{gleam in}} his eyes.|$|R
5000|$|... "My Dear Darby,:I {{grieve for}} your heavy loss of Brave fellows, <b>but</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> our glorious Victory.|$|R
60|$|She did not answer, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him reproachfully. He {{was smiling}} and smirking broadly at her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Guess you've {{just come}} to locate in them diggin's, strangers," [...] he said, {{addressing}} the party at large, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Ned, whose superior height and commanding cast of countenance proved him unmistakeably to be a leader.|$|E
60|$|Listening, <b>but</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> those wild, {{mourning}} {{eyes that}} never moved from him, he lay. Once {{he turned back}} toward the water, but fire had died within him; his hands dropped, nerveless--his young face was all bewilderment.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> him anxiously, {{she was not}} satisfied. His white face, {{firm and}} {{resolute}} though it was, had a certain despair in it which chilled her. The hopefulness of her words seemed to have found no echo in his heart.|$|E
60|$|She did not answer, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me, smiling. Her eyes glistened with tears, {{her bosom}} heaved.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Robarts made {{no answer}} to this, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Grace; and Grace looked down upon the ground.|$|R
60|$|Not a word said Teach, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> us like {{a frightened}} baby as we gagged and bound him.|$|R
6000|$|Bartley, who {{had paid}} no {{attention}} to what Witherby was saying, came up and took the checks. [...] "This is all right," [...] he said of one. <b>But</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the other, he added, [...] "Fifteen hundred dollars? Where is the dividend?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's possible. <b>But,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it as a {{personal}} matter, there are inducements he could offer ye. Horsfield's {{a man who has}} the handling of other folks' dollars, as weel as a good many of his own. It might be wise to stand in with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|However, he {{dismissed}} Mrs. Nicholson and her ward from his mind. About a fortnight later Merton {{received a letter}} directed in an uneducated hand. 'Another of the agricultural classes,' he thought, <b>but,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{the close of the}} epistle, he saw the name of Eliza Nicholson. She wrote: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{care not}} {{if he does}} <b>but</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me; he cannot whip me with the lashes of his eye.|$|R
60|$|Clutton did not answer, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{the master}} {{with his usual}} air of sardonic {{indifference}} to the world's opinion.|$|R
60|$|She did not answer, <b>but</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} soft bewilderment; then {{running to the}} dog seized him by the collar.|$|R
