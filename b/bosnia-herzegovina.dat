5|$|In early-to-mid 1912, Stojanović and his schoolmate Todor Ilić joined Narodna Odbrana (National Defence), an {{association}} founded in Serbia in December 1908 on {{the initiative of}} Branislav Nušić. It aimed to organise a guerrilla resistance to the Austrian annexation of <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina,</b> and to spread nationalist propaganda. National Defence soon established a network of local committees throughout Serbia and <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina.</b> Its members from the latter territory gathered intelligence on the Austrian army and passed it to the Serbian secret service.|$|E
5|$|While Mehmedbašić was {{travelling}} to <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina</b> from France, police {{searched his}} train for a thief. Thinking the police might be after him, {{he threw his}} weapons (a dagger {{and a bottle of}} poison) out the train window. Once he arrived in <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina</b> he had to set about looking for replacement weapons.|$|E

5|$|Downstream of {{confluence}} of the Una River, the Sava is once again tracing an international border—between Croatia and <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina.</b> Its meandering course runs generally eastwards along Gradiška, and Slavonski Brod to Županja, where it turns south to Brčko. There, the river resumes its predominantly eastward course towards Sremska Rača and {{confluence of}} the Drina River. The right bank of the Sava, in this segment of its course, belongs to <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina</b> (with Bosnia's all three administrative entities, Republika Srpska, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Brčko District, having gateway to the river), while the opposite bank belongs to Croatia and its Sisak-Moslavina, Brod-Posavina and Vukovar-Srijem counties, except {{in the area of}} Jamena and further downstream—which belongs to Serbia and the province of Vojvodina. No cities in this segment of the course span the river as it represents an international frontier, but there are adjacent settlements located in two different countries, divided by the Sava. Those include Gradiška, Brod and Brčko in <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina</b> and Stara Gradiška, Slavonski Brod and Gunja in Croatia opposite them.|$|E

5|$|Croatia's {{territory}} covers , {{making it}} the 127th largest country in the world. The physical geography of Croatia is defined by its location—it {{is described as a}} part of Central Europe and Southeast Europe, a part of the Balkans and Mitteleuropa. Croatia borders <b>Bosnia–Herzegovina</b> (for 1,009.1km) and Serbia (for 317.6km) in the east, Slovenia for 667.8km in the west, Hungary for 355.5km in the north and Montenegro for 22.6km and the Adriatic Sea in the south. It lies mostly between latitudes 42° and 47° N and longitudes 13° and 20° E. Part of the extreme south of Croatia is separated {{from the rest of the}} mainland by a short coastline strip around Neum belonging to <b>Bosnia–Herzegovina.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many weekend visitors—particularly from <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina,</b> Croatia and Slovenia—prefer Belgrade nightlife to that {{of their}} own capitals, due to a {{perceived}} friendly atmosphere, plentiful clubs and bars, cheap drinks, the lack of language difficulties, {{and the lack of}} restrictive night life regulation.|$|E
5|$|Stojanović was {{the third}} child and the first son of Serbian Orthodox priest Simo Stojanović and his wife Jovanka. He was born in Prijedor on 7April 1896. <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina</b> was then {{occupied}} by Austria-Hungary; Prijedor was located in Bosanska Krajina, the north-western region of the province. Stojanović's father {{was the third}} generation of his family {{to serve as a}} Serbian Orthodox priest. He had graduated from a theology faculty, becoming the first in the family to attain a higher level of education. Simo was active in the political struggle for ecclesiastical and educational autonomy for the Serbs in <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina.</b> Mladen Stojanović's maternal grandfather was a Serbian Orthodox priest from Dubica, Teodor Vujasinović; he had participated in Pecija's revolt against the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

5000|$|During Bosnian War, {{international}} mediators and envoys proposed several peace {{plans that}} included forming three federal units in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1992, EC diplomat José Cutileiro sketched a proposal {{in which he}} stated that the three constituent units would be [...] "based on national principles and taking into account economic, geographic, and other criteria". In late July of 1993, representatives of <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina's</b> three warring factions entered into {{a new round of}} negotiations. On 20 August, the UN mediators, Thorvald Stoltenberg and David Owen, unveiled a map that would organise Bosnia into three ethnic mini-states. Bosnian Serb forces would be given 52 percent of <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina's</b> territory, Muslims would be allotted 30 percent and Bosnia Croats would receive 18 percent. Sarajevo and Mostar would be districts belonging to none of the three states. On 29 August 1993 the Bosniak side rejected the plan.|$|R
50|$|Born {{and raised}} in the {{northern}} Bosnian city of Tuzla to Montenegrin parents (father Vukola from Žabljak and mother Poleksija Đurović from a village near Danilovgrad) who worked as school teachers, Žugić graduated from the University of Sarajevo's Faculty of Law. In 1988 he found employment at SR <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina's</b> Secretariat of the Interior (SUP), before advancing to the position of sector chief at state security's Tuzla branch in 1991.|$|R
5|$|The {{largest city}} in <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina</b> {{situated}} on the Sava River course is Brčko, whose urban population is estimated at 40,000.

5|$|On 26 September 1941, the General Staff for the People's Liberation Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia held {{a conference}} at Stolice in the German-occupied {{territory}} of Serbia, {{at which it}} adopted a standard structure for the military organisation of the resistance. The General Staff was renamed the Supreme Staff, and the Military Staff of each province became the General Staff. The basic Partisan unit {{was to be a}} company of 80–100 soldiers, composed of platoons and sections. Two to four companies were to make up a battalion, and three to four battalions formed a detachment, the largest unit of the Partisan forces. Each detachment would have a staff consisting of a commander and deputy, with a political commissar and deputy, and the detachment staff would be directly responsible to the General Staff. On that basis, the existing Partisan units operating in <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina</b> were re-organised in October and November 1941 into ten detachments, six in east Bosnia, three in Bosanska Krajina, and one in Herzegovina. The Sarajevo and Tuzla Military Staffs were dissolved and detachments in those regions were placed under the direct control of the General Staff for the People's Liberation Partisan Detachments of <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rice {{enlisted in}} the United States Army {{at the age of}} 17.

His military service included duty in <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina</b> as a staff officer during UN peacekeeping operations, and as project officer for a Colorado National Guard program to provide medical care to poor civilians.|$|E
5000|$|... 1 The {{competition}} rules {{state that the}} two best runners-up qualify to the intermediary round, with only {{the results of the}} runners-up against the winners and third-ranked team in each group being taken into account. However, due to the Bosnian-Herzegovinian Football Federation being suspended by UEFA and FIFA as of 1 April 2011, Dalmacija, the worst runner-up, was allowed to progress to the intermediary round, replacing <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina's</b> representative team, Kanton Sarajevo, in Group 6.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2013, the RDC {{published}} {{its final}} research on <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina's</b> war casualties, titled The Bosnian Book of the Dead. This database includes 97,207 confirmed names of Bosnia and Herzegovina's citizens, {{killed during the}} 1992-1995 war, with an additional 5,100 unconfirmed names.An international team of experts evaluated the findings before they were released.

40|$|<b>Bosnia-Herzegovina's</b> {{provisional}} constitutional system, as {{created by}} the Dayton Agreement, has outlived its purpose by more than ten years. Economic and political governance are now even more deadlocked by corruption, political recriminations and institutional failure. Fouéré and Blockmans argue {{the need for more}} robust engagement by both the EU and the US and for a constitutional convention to spur reform. This should facilitate the transition from the country’s current status as international protectorate to sustainable self-government, guided by the EU pre-accession process...|$|R
5|$|The Sava River basin is very {{significant}} {{because of its}} biological diversity, and it contains large alluvial wetlands and lowland forests.

5|$|A {{large part}} of the team's support base {{consists}} of fans of Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb, the two best-supported clubs in the Croatian domestic league, the Prva HNL. The clubs' ultra-style supporter groups, the Bad Blue Boys of Zagreb and The Torcida from Split, have both been associated with hooliganism, though violence between the two groups does not usually occur at international games. Heavy support for the Croatian national team also comes from Croats in <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina,</b> particularly from fans of Zrinjski Mostar. The official Croatia supporters' club endorsed by the Croatian Football Federation is called Uvijek Vjerni (Always Faithful).|$|E
5|$|After {{conducting}} a criminal investigation, verifying that Germany would honor its military alliance, and persuading the skeptical Hungarian Count Tisza, Austria-Hungary issued a formal {{letter to the}} government of Serbia. The letter reminded Serbia of its commitment to respect the Great Powers' decision regarding <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina,</b> and to maintain good neighborly relations with Austria-Hungary. The letter contained specific demands aimed at preventing the publication of propaganda advocating the violent destruction of Austria-Hungary, removing the people behind this propaganda from the Serbian Military, arresting the people on Serbian soil {{who were involved in the}} assassination plot and preventing the clandestine shipment of arms and explosives from Serbia to Austria-Hungary.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{signing with}} Željezničar, Pelak {{was one of}} the most popular players for Sarajevo, earning the praise of the press as well {{supporters}} for his high work rate and leadership ability. He was a key part of Sarajevo's exceptionally talented youth squad composed of players born in 1981/1982 that {{was one of the}} most talented squads in <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina's</b> history. Many players from that generation such as Alen Škoro, Džemal Berberović, Damir Mirvić went on to have relatively successful careers in Europe.|$|R
50|$|The regiment's {{participation}} in Operation Joint Guard {{began when the}} 2nd and 3rd Squadrons moved across the Sava River into Bosnia in August 1997 to augment the 1st Infantry Division (Forward) in support of <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina's</b> municipal elections. The regiment's air cavalry, the 4th Squadron and the Regimental Support Squadron also moved into the country. The regiment's separate units - the 502nd Military Intelligence Company; the 84th Engineer Company; Company H (Aviation Maintenance), 159th Aviation Regiment; and the Air Defense Battery - completed the regimental troop list.|$|R

5|$|Along {{with the}} three East Bosnian Shock Battalions, the Partisan General Staff of <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina</b> first {{attempted}} to cross the Bosna to follow the Partisan Supreme Headquarters and main force to western Bosnia, but instead retreated to Birač, where they joined forces with the Birač Detachment {{at the end of}} May. The Birač Partisan Detachment was the only Partisan or volunteer detachment in East Bosnia not to suffer a pro-Chetnik coup in March–May 1942. By June–July 1942, the Partisans in eastern Bosnia had been reduced to a strength of around 600 fighters.|$|E
5|$|At fifteen, Stojanović {{became an}} activist {{in a group}} of student {{organizations}} called Young Bosnia, which strongly opposed Austria-Hungary's occupation of <b>Bosnia-Herzegovina.</b> In 1912, Stojanović was inducted into Narodna Odbrana, an association founded in Serbia with the goal of organizing guerrilla resistance to Bosnia-Herzegovina's annexation by Austria-Hungary. Stojanović was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian authorities in July 1914, and although he was sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment, he was pardoned in 1917. He graduated as a Doctor of Medicine after World War I, and in 1929, opened a private practice in the town of Prijedor. In September 1940, he {{became a member of the}} Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ).|$|E
5|$|Groundwater {{is a very}} {{important}} resource in the Sava River basin, generally used for public water supply of potable water, as a source of water for industrial use, but also as the mainstay of aquatic ecosystems.
