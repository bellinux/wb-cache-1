2500|$|During the Iranian presidential {{election}} of 2005, some people, including Mehdi Karroubi, a reformist candidate who ranked {{third in the}} election, alleged that a network of mosques, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, and <b>Basij</b> <b>militia</b> forces, have been illegally used to generate and mobilize support for Ahmadinejad. Karroubi has explicitly alleged that Mojtaba Khamenei, a son of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, is involved. Ahmadinejad's supporters consider these to be false allegations. Furthermore, Khamenei has written to Karroubi stating that his allegations are [...] "below his dignity" [...] and [...] "will result in a crisis"; in Iran, which he will not allow. As a reply, Karroubi resigned from all his political posts, including his positions {{as an adviser to}} the Supreme Leader and {{as a member of the}} Expediency Discernment Council, both of which he had been appointed to directly by Khamenei. Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Ahmadinejad's rival in the second round, has also pointed to what he claims are [...] "organized and unjust" [...] interventions conducted by [...] "guiding" [...] the votes, and has supported Karroubi's complaint. Rafsanjani also alleged a [...] "dirty tricks" [...] campaign had [...] "illegally" [...] propelled Ahmadinejad into the presidency, an allegation which he strongly denies. In the same statement, Rafsanjani stated that he would only appeal the election results to [...] "God", and recommended accepting the results and [...] "assisting" [...] the new president-elect.|$|E

50|$|Whitson {{has criticized}} Iran for locking up {{political}} prisoners, {{as well as}} for what she calls its “patently unfair justice system,” especially for those facing execution. She has also come down against Iran’s treatment and legal discrimination of women, as well as the jailing of women’s rights activists. “The detention of these women activists is a stark reminder that Iran’s government deprives its people of their most basic and fundamental rights” added Whitson. She has criticized the personal status of Iranian women in matters related to marriage, divorce, inheritance, and child custody. In 2011, Whitson spoke out against Iran’s politically motivated trial of two American hikers, Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer, on supposed espionage charges, calling the trial “little more than a political jab at the United States.” In 2009, following disputed Iranian presidential elections, Whitson condemned abuses of the pro-government <b>Basij</b> <b>militias</b> who were violently raiding the homes of opposition supporters, who had protested the election results, and beating residents in an attempt to end these protests.|$|R

50|$|A Western analyst {{believed}} {{thousands of}} Iranian paramilitary Basij fighters were stationed in Syria as of December 2013. Syria's geopolitical importance to Iran {{and its role}} as one of Iran's crucial allies prompted the involvement of Basij militiamen in the ongoing Syrian Civil War. The <b>Basij</b> <b>militia,</b> similar to Hizballah fighters, work with the Syrian army against rebel forces. Such involvement poses new foreign policy challenges {{for a number of}} countries across the region, particularly Israel and Turkey as Iran's influence becomes more than just ideological and monetary {{on the ground in the}} Syrian conflict. The Basij involvement in the Syrian Civil War reflects previous uses of the militia as a proxy force for Iranian foreign policy in an effort to assert Iranian dominance in the region and frightens Salim Idriss, head of the Free Syrian Army.|$|E
50|$|Protesters began {{gathering}} {{in the tens of}} thousands throughout Iran and especially in Tehran.

In one neighborhood, Basij members reportedly took over a commercial building and dropped tear gas canisters from the roof onto protesters. Eyewitnesses reported that two protesters were killed by Basij paramilitaries, one each in the Vanak and Vali Asr squares. Police arrested a number of protesters and were seen stopping people on the streets and frisking them, along with removing people from vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{the source}} Tehran Bureau, the {{official}} version appeared to resemble the [...] "well-orchestrated disinformation operation" [...] employed by the government [...] "to blame anyone but its security forces {{for the death of}} Neda Agha Soltan during the unrest of 2009." [...] Suspicion has been cast on official reports of Jaleh's death by the evolution its portrayal of Jaleh first simply as a [...] "devout student," [...] then as a [...] "regime sympathizer," [...] and finally as a [...] "full-fledged <b>Basij</b> <b>militia</b> member". [...] The claim of his membership in the Basij was made in a statement about his death {{by the president of the}} Arts University, though in an earlier report of Jaleh's death the head of public relations for the Student Basij was quoted and made no mention of Jaleh's alleged Basij membership.|$|E
5000|$|In Iran, students, {{members of}} <b>Basij</b> <b>militia</b> and {{interested}} people are routinely {{taken to the}} former battle sites of Iran-Iraq War as the war is considered by the Iranian ruling regime a [...] "holy defense" [...] and an ideological pillar {{to the existence of}} the ruling Islamic Republic. The trips are organized by Basij, an offshoot of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) which enlists the travelers normally in mosques, schools or universities. The trips, which are officially called [...] "Tours for the Travelers of Light" [...] (in Persian: اردوهای راهیان نور) are low-cost and are taken by bus, under poor safety conditions. Since 2008, the buses taking the [...] "tourists" [...] have caused death to over 75 travelers in about seven trips. in 2013, the then Education Minister Hajibabayi proposed that those killed in these tours be granted the degree of martyr.|$|E
