50|$|Insect growth {{regulators}}Insect growth regulators (IGRs) such as juvenile and moulting hormones {{or their}} analogs (juvenoids and ecdysoids) when used judiciously, {{have been found}} to be useful in insect culture such as sericulture industry. In addition, ecdysoids also show a variety of other uses such as insecticidal, as biochemical tool in gene expression studies, as wound healing and anabolic agents (body building agents with enhancing protein synthesis), as nutraceuticals and cosmetics (hair growth) IGRs occur in insects in very small amounts and are not practical source for these phytochemicals. However, with the discovery of their occurrence in significant quantities in some plants, IGRs and their analogs became easily available in substantial amounts. As a result, many new bioactivities of ecdysoids and juvenoids were discovered. Besides use in insect sericulture, they have found applications in apiculture and aquaculture (prawns). Ecdysoids show remarkable anabolic activities in human and are very much in demand as nutraceuticals (food supplements) including body building agent. Realizing the economic potential of IGRs, <b>bioprospection</b> for these compounds from indigenous plant sources was undertaken. Surveys indicate that a large number plants belonging to different taxa contain IGRs.|$|E

40|$|The Guatemala potato tuber moth Tecia solanivora (Povolny) (Lep. Gelechiidae) is an {{invasive}} species from Mesoamerica that has considerably extended its distribution area in recent decades. While this species {{is considered to}} be a major potato pest in Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador, currently no specific control methods are available for farmers. To address this issue we developed a biopesticide formulation to be used in integrated pest management of T. solanivora, following three steps. First, search for entomopathogenic viruses were carried out through extensive <b>bioprospections</b> in 12 countries worldwide. As a result, new Phthorimaea operculella granulovirus (PhopGV) isolates were found in T. solanivora and five other gelechid species. Second, twenty PhopGV isolates, including both previously known and newly found isolates, were genetically and/or biologically characterized in order to choose the best candidate for a biopesticide formulation. Sequence data were obtained for the ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt) gene, a single copy gene known to play a role in pathogenicity. Three different sizes (1086, 1305 and 1353 bp) of egt were found among the virus isolates analyzed. Unexpectedly, no obvious correlation between egt size and pathogenicity was found. Bioassays on T. solanivora neonates showed a maximum of a 14 -fold difference in pathogenicity among the eight PhopGV isolates tested. The most pathogenic PhopGV isolate, JLZ 9 f, had a medium lethal concentration (LC 50) of 10 viral occlusion bodies per square mm of consumed tuber skin. Third, we tested biopesticide dust formulations by mixing a dry carrier (calcium carbonate) with different adjuvants (magnesium chloride or an optical brightener or soya lecithin) and different specific amounts of JLZ 9 f. During laboratory experiments, satisfactory control of the pest (> 98 % larva mortality compared to untreated control) was achieved with a formulation containing 10 macerated JLZ 9 f-dead T. solanivora larvae per kg of calcium carbonate mixed with 50 mL/kg of soya lecithin.

Because of this use, commercial and scientific interests have emerged, making it necessary to realize ethnobotanical surveys of medicinal plants species, which is important for subsequent chemical and pharmacological <b>bioprospections.</b> Aim of the study This study aimed at surveying, identifying, cataloging and documenting the medicinal plants species used in the Valley of Juruena, Northwestern Mato Grosso, Legal Amazon Brazil for the treatment of various human diseases, as well as assessed the species of interest for bioprospecting potential. Materials and methods Informants were interviewed using semi-structured form to capture information on socio-demographic and ethnopharmacological data of medicinal plants such as vernacular name, uses, geographic origin, habit, form of preparation and part used. Results were analyzed using descriptive and quantitative means: indices of use-report (Ur) and informant consensus factor (ICF), for the selection of plant species with therapeutic potential. Results Three hundred and thirty two (332) plants species belonging to 90 families were reported for medicinal purposes and totaling 3973 use-reports were reported by 365 (92. 9 %) of the people interviewed. Asteraceae (32. 2 %), Fabaceae (26. 7 %) and Lamiaceae (24. 4 %) families were the most represented, with majority being species native (64. 45 %) to Brazil. Leaves (64. 5 %) were the part of the plant most used and infusion (45. 7 %) was the most utilized form. Gastrointestinal disorders followed by respiratory complaints topped the list of use-reports. The native or naturalized plants with the highest use reports in the order of decreasing absolute frequency per each emic-category are Cymbopogon citratus (DC.) Stapfc (104), Mentha pulegium L. (94), Arrabidaea chica (Humb. & Bonpl.) B. Verl. (97), Alternanthera brasiliana (L.) Kuntze (71), Baccharis crispa Spreng (57), Phyllanthus niruri L. (48), Gossypium barbadense L. (44), Solidago microglossa DC. (40) and Bauhinia forficata L. (20). And the most cited exotics are: Chenopodium ambrosioides L. (151), Aloe vera (L.) Burm. f., (89) and Rosmarinus officinalis L. (72). In some cases, high ICF values were found, which reflects high degree of homogeneity of consensus among informants in this region on medicinal plants. Conclusion The population of Valle of Juruena makes use of a wide array of medicinal plants distributed in all use categories with predominance of those use in the treatments of gastrointestinal and respiratory ailments. The therapeutic potential of some of the species of medicinal importance extensively utilized by the population of the region have been scientifically validated, and are therefore promising prototype of new drugs.

40|$|<b>Bioprospection</b> is, largely, {{meant to}} help {{reducing}} deforestation and, the other way around, stopping deforestation enhances the prospects of <b>bioprospection.</b> The need for a global agreement {{to the problem of}} tropical deforestation has led to the REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) scheme, which 10 proposes that developed countries pay developing countries for CO 2 emissions saved through avoided deforestation and degradation. The remaining issue at stake is to define the rules defining payments to countries reducing their deforestation rate. This article develops a game-theoretic bargaining model, simulating the on-going negotiation process which is currently taking place within the Convention of Climate 15 Change, after the Copenhagen agreement of December 2009. It shows that the conditions under which developing countries are left to bargain over the allocation of the global forest fund may lead to an inefective system of incentives. Below a given level of contributions from the North, the mechanism fails to curb the deforestation. Beyond this level, it induces perverse effects: the larger the North's contribution, the 20 larger the deforestation rate. Consequently, the mechanism is most effective only at a specific threshold level which, given the unobservability of countries'preferences, can only be found by a repeated "trial and error" implementation process...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cellulases and lipases have broad {{industrial}} application, {{which calls}} for an urgent exploration of microorganisms from extreme environments as valuable source of commercial enzyme. In this context, the present work describes the <b>bioprospection</b> and identification of deep-sea bacteria that produce cellulases and lipases, as well their optimal temperature of activity. Results: The first step {{of this study was}} the screening of cellulolytic and lipolytic deep-sea bacteria from sediment and water column, which was conducted with substrates linked with 4 -Methylumbelliferyl. Among the 161 strains evaluated, 40 were cellulolytic, 23 were lipolytic and 5 exhibited both activities. Cellulolytic and lipolytic bacteria are more common in sediment than at the water column. Based on the ability to produce cellulases and lipases three isolates were selected and identified (16 S rRNA sequencing) as Bacillus stratosphericus, B. aerophilus and B. pumilus. Lipases of strain B. aerophilus LAMA 582 exhibited activity at a wide temperature range (4 º to 37 ºC) and include psychrophilic behaviour. Strain Bacillus stratosphericus LAMA 585 can growth in a rich (Luria Bertani) and minimal (Marine Minimal) medium, and does not need an inducer to produce its mesophilic cellulases and lipases. Conclusions: Deep-sea sediments have great potential for <b>bioprospection</b> of cellulase and lipase-producing bacteria.

The focus is on a dynamic approach to contracting and property rights building upon insights from evolutionary institutional economics. Drawing on a unique 'access and benefit sharing' (ABS) bioprospecting contract from the Western Ghats, India, we show how the monetary value of plant genetic information from the traditional knowledge holders' perspective can be assessed using a contingent valuation modelling approach. While the study allows the identification of such values {{from one of the}} main stakeholder's (i. e, the Kani community) perspective, it also allows to point out some of the key gaps in the valuation of GR/TK associated to ABS cases from an evolutionary institutional perspective. Two important conclusions come out of this analysis. First, it highlights the necessity to go beyond standard market approaches to economic valuation of GR/TK in order to address the issues of future possibilities of use and innovation and the integration of the different stages in the process of value creation from GR/TK. Second, it shows the necessity of developing alternatives to the current intellectual property rights regime, including systems for appropriate protection of TK of local communities. <b>Bioprospection,</b> genetic resources, traditional knowledge, Kani model, Western Ghats, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies,...|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho tem como propÃsito realizar o mapeamento das redes de bioprospecÃÃo no Brasil e as abordagens legais que envolvem o acesso aos recursos genÃticos para fins de bioprospecÃÃo. A BioprospecÃÃo se tornou uma das principais discussÃes nos Ãltimos anos desde que a ConvenÃÃo sobre Diversidade BiolÃgica (CDB) reconheceu a soberania de cada paÃs sobre os recursos genÃticos localizados em seu territÃrio. Ainda, o reconhecimento de cada paÃs signatÃrio da CDB na implementaÃÃo de polÃticas nacionais de biodiversidade. Para atender essas e outras exigÃncias, o Brasil estabeleceu aÃÃes voltadas Ã conservaÃÃo e ao uso sustentÃvel da biodiversidade por meio de programas e redes de pesquisa. Neste contexto, o trabalho identificou os avanÃos quanto Ã criaÃÃo e fortalecimento das redes de pesquisa em biodiversidade e os resultados obtidos por meio do desenvolvimento de produtos, em especial, a produÃÃo de biofÃrmacos. No entanto, a Medida ProvisÃria nÂ 2. 186 - 16 / 2001 considerada o marco regulatÃrio a respeito do acesso aos recursos genÃticos no Brasil estabeleceu normas que tem provocado entraves ao desenvolvimento das pesquisas bioprospectivas.

This {{work has}} as its {{objective}} to map the <b>bioprospection</b> networks in Brazil, {{as well as the}} legal approaches involved in the access to genetic resources for <b>bioprospection</b> purposes. <b>Bioprospection</b> {{has become one of the}} main topics of discussion in recent years, since the Biological Diversity Convention (CBD in Portuguese) recognized the sovereignty of each country over genetic resources found within their territories. Moreover, the CDB recognized the right of each signatory country in the implementation of their own national biodiversity policies. In order to fulfil these and other demands, Brazil has established actions focused on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity through research programmes and networks. In this context, this work has identified the progress regarding the creation and strengthening of research networks in biodiversity, as well as the results obtained through the development of products, especially bio-pharmaceuticals. However, the Provisional Policy No. 2. 186 - 16 / 2001, considered to be the regulatory framework regarding the genetic resources in Brazil, has established norms that have caused obstructions to the development of bioprospective research. As a result, there is a common agreement about the need to improve the Provisional Policy No. 2. 186 - 16 / 2001, which is presently in course through a Law Bill.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Animals {{have been}} used as {{treatment}} for various illnesses by many human cultures. This paper explores the phenomenon of zootherapy in the Federal District, Central West region of Brazil. Fieldwork was carried out from September to October 2006 by visiting one permanent free market in each of three cities within Brazilian Federal District. Data were obtained by open-ended interviews of six traders (four women and two men), who were questioned about zootherapeutic species, modes of use and administration of the folk remedies, as well as the diseases for which they are prescribed. A total of 30 animals belonging to nine taxonomic groups were recorded. Fats are the body parts most cited as sources of medicines (n= 21; 57 %), but other raw materials including leather, feather, gizzard, cartilage, liver (bile), milk, and spines are used to prepare both traditional medicines and charms. Zootherapy should be viewed from the multidimensional perspective of sustainable development. The exploration of animals for medicinal purposes should be a major subject in discussions on conservation biology, public health policies, sustainable management of natural resources, <b>bioprospection</b> and patents...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper was}} the study of the useful plants sold in the open-air fairs of Petrópolis and Nova Friburgo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Data {{collection}} was obtained through participant observation, semi structured interviews and free listing with four herbalist informants. From the interviews, 115 species (belonging to 49 families) were recorded: 94 for medicinal purposes, 12 with religious application, and 9 for ornamental purposes. Thirty percent of the species were native, and 72 % herbaceous. The most representative families were Asteraceae (26 species) and Lamiaceae (10 species). The medicinal species related to diseases of the respiratory system were more common during the winter and autumn. "Espinheira-santa" (Clarisia cf. ilicifolia) had the highest Relative Importance (1. 8) and collocation in all seasons using the Preference Ranking, although its effectiveness or toxicity levels have not been established. The importance of the study is to gather knowledge from local herbalists about commercialized species in open-air fairs and popular markets in the Rio de Janeiro State, which represent valuable resources for <b>bioprospection...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of the Earth’s microbes remain unknown, and that their potential utility cannot be exploited until they are discovered and characterized. They provide wide scope {{for the development of}} new strains as well as biotechnological uses. The documentation and <b>bioprospection</b> of microorganisms carry enormous significance considering their relevance to human welfare. This calls for an urgent need to develop a database with emphasis on the microbial diversity of the largest untapped reservoirs in the biosphere. The data annotated in the North-East India Microbial database (NEMiD) were obtained by the isolation and characterization of microbes from different parts of the Eastern Himalayan region. The database was constructed as a relational database management system (RDBMS) for data storage in MySQL in the back-end on a Linux server and implemented in an Apache/PHP environment. This database provides a base for understanding the soil microbial diversity pattern in this megabiodiversity hotspot and indicates the distribution patterns of various organisms along with identification. The NEMiD database is freely available at www. mblabnehu. info/nemid/...|$|E
40|$|Significant human {{impacts on}} {{tropical}} forests {{have been considered}} the preserve of recent societies, linked to large-scale deforestation, resource mining, livestock grazing, and plantation industries. Cumulative archaeological evidence now demonstrates, however, that Homo sapiens has actively manipulated tropical forest ecologies for at least 45, 000 years. It is clear that these millennia of impacts {{need to be taken}} into account when studying and conserving tropical forest ecosystems today. Nevertheless, archaeology has so far provided minimal practical insight into contemporary human-tropical forest interactions. Here, we review significant archaeological evidence for impacts of prehistoric hunter-gatherers, agriculturalists, and urban settlements on global tropical forests. We compare the challenges faced, as well as the solutions adopted, by these groups with those confronting present-day societies, which rely on tropical forests for ecosystem services, ranging from the maintenance of global carbon sinks to <b>bioprospection</b> for medicinal plants. We emphasise archaeology’s importance in not only promoting natural and cultural heritage in tropical forests, but also taking an active role in informing modern conservation and policy-making...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Embelia ribes or Embelia tsjeriam-cottam, more {{commonly}} known as vidanga, {{is a type of}} ayurvedic medicine that has been used to treat various diseases {{for a number of years}}. Bright orange embelin-rich fruits have been well established as ethnomedicinals, for a number of years with their pharmacological actions attributed to their hydroxybenzoquinone active constituent. Embelin has become known specifically for its antihelminthic and contraceptive use. Areas covered: This drug evaluation provides a historical summary of embelin along with its therapeutic use, phytochemistry and toxicology. Embelin's pharmacotherapeutical properties are also discussed along with its molecular targets. It is hoped that this article will help to draw the attention of researchers and biopharmaceutical companies to the untapped potential in <b>bioprospection</b> for the development of new drugs. Expert opinion: Embelin is the only known non-peptide small-molecule X-linked inhibitor of the apoptosis protein (XIAP) - an anti-apoptotic protein considered a promising cancer therapeutic target. Embelin acts as an NF-kappa B blocker and potential suppressor of tumorigenesis. It also exhibits potent cytotoxic, antioxidant and cancer chemopreventive effects. Given the potential uses of embelin, it is recommended that further investigations take place to properly explore its pharmacological and clinical effects...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Alternanthera philoxeroides is a {{promising}} {{species in the}} search for new molecules with biological effects. To accelerate this <b>bioprospection</b> process of A. philoxeroides, the chosen methods (allelopathy and discdiffusion technique) are excellent alternatives. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the allelopathic effects and verify the antibacterial properties of extracts from A. philoxeroides. To evaluate the antibacterial activity, disc diffusion technique was used with five reference strains. The germination test was conducted with the extracts at concentrations of 0, 1. 0, 2. 0 e 3. 0 mg mL- 1 in a petri dish with 30 lettuce seeds and for the growth trial 10 seeds were used. The experimental design was completely randomized in factorial 4 × 2 × 4 (four extracts, two sources, four concentrations), with four replicates. The results indicate that the lettuce germination was influenced by ethyl acetate fraction obtained from leaves of A. philoxeroides at the highest concentrations; however, the germination speed and the radicle growth were significantly affected by all the extracts starting at 1 mg mL- 1 concentration. Those results demonstrate allopathic effect of different extracts of this plant, although they have not interfered with the strains growth used in this experiment...|$|E
