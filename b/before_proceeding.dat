5|$|It {{seems likely}} that Urbicus planned his {{campaign}} of attack from Corbridge, advancing north and leaving garrison forts at High Rochester in Northumberland and possibly also at Trimontium as he struck towards the Firth of Forth. Having secured an overland supply route for military personnel and equipment along Dere Street, Urbicus very likely set up a supply port at Carriden for the supply of grain and other foodstuffs <b>before</b> <b>proceeding</b> against the Damnonii.|$|E
5|$|On 21 April, the Grand Fleet {{conducted}} a demonstration off Horns Reef {{to distract the}} Germans while the Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea.

The Grand Fleet did not arrive in the area until after the Germans had withdrawn, however.

The former had to unexpectedly manoeuvre to avoid a guardship at the entrance and Conqueror could not avoid her. Monarch suffered moderate damage to her stern and received temporary repairs at Scapa <b>before</b> <b>proceeding</b> to Devonport for full repairs on 4 January 1915, rejoining the Grand Fleet on 20 January.|$|E
5|$|The one-act opera genre {{had become}} {{increasingly}} popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno {{for the best}} such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project.

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the festivities in the United States, Seeadler steamed back across the Atlantic to the Azores, <b>before</b> <b>proceeding</b> into the Mediterranean Sea and then into the Red Sea. There, she met Schwalbe at Aden on 20 June. Seeadler proceeded to Bombay, India, for routine maintenance that lasted from 3 July to 21 August. The cruiser finally arrived on station on 2 September when she dropped anchor in Zanzibar and met the survey ship , the other vessel on the East Africa Station. On 9 September both ships went to Kilwa; a group of slave traders had attacked the small police force detachment stationed there. The colonial army, the Schutztruppe (protection force), was unavailable to reinforce the police troops, and so Seeadler and Möwe bombarded the slavers and neutralized the threat.|$|E
5|$|Alvarado rested {{two days}} at Tazuzcalco, <b>before</b> <b>proceeding</b> to Miahuaclan, {{which had been}} {{abandoned}} by its inhabitants, then on to Atehuan (modern Ateos, near the Pipil city of Cuscatlan, capital of {{the province of the}} same name). Messengers from the lords of Cuscatlan brought promises of submission to the King of Spain, but when Pedro de Alvarado's army arrived at the city, he found {{that the majority of the}} inhabitants had fled. Alvarado sent messengers to them, ordering them to return and submit, but they refused. Alvarado tried them in their absence, and condemned them to death; he branded all the Pipil prisoners as slaves.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the rising}} {{international}} tensions following {{the assassination of}} Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June, the High Seas Fleet began its summer cruise to Norway on 13 July. During the last peacetime cruise of the Imperial Navy, the fleet conducted drills off Skagen <b>before</b> <b>proceeding</b> to the Norwegian fjords on 25 July. The following day the fleet began to steam back to Germany, {{as a result of}} Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia. On the 27th, the entire fleet assembled off Cape Skudenes before returning to port, where the ships remained at a heightened state of readiness. War between Austria-Hungary and Serbia broke out the following day, and in the span of a week all of the major European powers had joined the conflict.|$|E

5|$|Each passing loop is {{controlled}} by a small signal box, known as a block-post. These house the lever frames that control the points, the token equipment and telephones. The railway has few signals; instead it has stop boards at Pendre, Brynglas, Quarry Siding and Nant Gwernol, and the blockman allows trains to proceed by use of flags. There are colour light signals located at Tywyn Wharf, operated from the Control Office and disc signals controlled from the ground frame. Abergynolwyn has colour light signals, which are operated from the blockpost.

5|$|Euryalus {{became the}} {{flagship}} of Rear Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss in April, {{after he was}} put in charge of the main landings at Gallipoli. During the landings at Cape Helles on the morning of 25 April, Euryalus transported three companies of the 1st Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers and a platoon of the Royal Naval Division, and then provided fire support to the landing after the soldiers were transferred to their boats for the actual landing on Beach 'W'. She also bombarded Turkish positions during the Second Battle of Krithia on 6 May. A month later, Wemyss hauled down his flag and resumed his original commanding of the Allied base at Mudros. Euryalus received a brief refit at Malta from 30 December 1915 to 20 January 1916 <b>before</b> <b>proceeding</b> to Egypt to reinforce the defences there.|$|E
5|$|In mid-October 1905, Seeadler sent {{a landing}} party ashore at Samanga {{to protect the}} coastal {{telegraph}} line there. By mid-December, she had returned to Dar es Salaam, <b>before</b> <b>proceeding</b> to Kilwa on 17 January 1906. The cruiser was back in Dar es Salaam on 24 January. Another overhaul at Cape Town followed from 10 February to 16 March. By this time, the situation in East Africa had calmed, and the light cruiser , which had also been sent to suppress the Maji-Maji uprising, {{was sent back to}} Germany. Seeadler nevertheless remained in the region, and was formally assigned to the East Africa Station in early 1907. In October 1907, then-Korvettenkapitän (Lieutenant Commander) Hugo Meurer served as the ship's commanding officer. He would hold the position until June 1909.|$|E
