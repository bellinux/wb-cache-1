5000|$|The {{increased}} {{mortality and}} birth defects observed among British Pakistanis may, however, have another source besides current consanguinity. This is population subdivision among different Pakistani groups. Population subdivision results from decreased gene flow among different {{groups in a}} population. Because members of Pakistani biradari have married only inside these groups for generations, offspring have higher average homozygosity even for couples with no known genetic relationship. According to a statement by the UK's Human Genetics Commission on cousin marriages, the BBC also [...] "fails to clarify" [...] that children born to these marriages were {{not found to be}} 13 times more likely to develop genetic disorders. Instead they are 13 times more likely to develop recessive genetic disorders. The HGC states, [...] "Other types of genetic conditions, including chromosomal abnormalities, sex-linked conditions and autosomal dominant conditions are not influenced by cousin marriage." [...] The HGC goes on to compare the <b>biological</b> <b>risk</b> between cousin marriage and increased maternal age, arguing that [...] "Both represent complex cultural trends. Both however, also carry a <b>biological</b> <b>risk.</b> They key difference, GIG argue, is that cousin marriage is more common amongst a British minority population." [...] Genetic effects from cousin marriage in Britain are more obvious than in a developing country like Pakistan because the number of confounding environmental diseases is lower.

This study analysed contract farming arrangements in the export banana industry in the Philippines amidst an expanding epidemic of Panama disease. We developed a political ecology of risk approach to investigate how ideas about technological and <b>biological</b> <b>risks</b> are influenced by contractual arrangements, and we borrowed from Cultural Theory the insight that risk and blame are connected concepts, always political, and disadvantage marginalized groups through disproportionate risk burdens. Data collection involved the study of contracts, interviews with decision-makers, and focus group discussions with agrarian cooperatives. The views of both large corporations as well as organized smallholders were recorded. We found that the former contractually compel the latter to bear the burden of the disease, while blaming them for its spread. Risk decisions were embedded in the dynamics of agrarian social relationships, and economic and political arrangements between actors influenced possibilities and limitations for disease control. We argue that the contractual stipulations, in concert with blaming processes, create a discursive environment that both allow inequitable relations to remain unquestioned, and constrain possibilities for control of Panama disease. <br/...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{biological}} predisposition {{one thinks}} of is genetics. Despite Moffitt's original projection that life-course persistent antisocial behavior was more genetically influenced than the adolescent limited variety, a recent study found similar levels of genetic influence on both childhood-onset and adolescent-onset antisocial behavior. [...] Interestingly, childhood-onset antisocial behavior shares common genetic underpinnings with {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) and young adult antisocial behavior, whereas adolescent-onset antisocial behavior does not share any of these common genetic underpinnings. Several experiments use individuals with antisocial parents who have been adopted and raised by other people. Consistently, however, antisocial behavior prevails in the child despite the deviant, biological parents being absent. [...] One such experiment used individuals whose biological parents exhibited criminal behavior and who were adopted. When the adoptive environment was adverse and the genetic predisposition was present, 40% of the adoptees partook in criminal activity compared to only 12.1% with only genetic predispositions. In another study, significant heritability was found for crime, but one subsequent finding was particularly interesting. Heritability was higher in individuals from high socioeconomic background and those from rural areas. [...] This shows the link between antisocial behavior and <b>biological</b> <b>risk</b> will be stronger in individuals from kindly social backgrounds than individuals from adverse social backgrounds [...] "because the social causes of crime camouflage the biological contribution.
