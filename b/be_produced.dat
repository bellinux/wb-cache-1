5|$|A production–possibility {{frontier}} (PPF) or {{production possibility}} curve (PPC) is a graphical representation of possible combinations of two goods (such as butter and guns) that can <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> with constant technology and resources {{per unit of}} time, such that more of one good could <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> only by diverting resources from the other good, resulting in less production of it; i. e. production tradeoffs, usually for an economy, but which can also be interpreted as applying for an individual, household, etc.|$|E
5|$|Also, pure {{lanthanum}} can <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> by electrolysis {{of molten}} mixture of anhydrous LaCl3 and NaCl or KCl at elevated temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it can <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> only by producing less of the other.|$|E

5|$|It {{can also}} <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> by {{oxidising}} the ephedrine analogue 4-methylephedrine using potassium permanganate dissolved in sulfuric acid.

5|$|Mendelevium is a {{synthetic}} element with chemical symbol Md (formerly Mv) and atomic number 101. A metallic radioactive transuranic {{element in the}} actinide series, {{it is the first}} element that currently cannot <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> in macroscopic quantities through neutron bombardment of lighter elements. It is the third-to-last actinide and the ninth transuranic element. It can only <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. A total of sixteen mendelevium isotopes are known, the most stable being 258Md with a half-life of 51days; nevertheless, the shorter-lived 256Md (half-life 1.17hours) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> on a larger scale.|$|E
