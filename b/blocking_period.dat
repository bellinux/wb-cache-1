The state-of-the-art medium-range ensemble forecasts performed well in simulating the frequencies of Euro-Atlantic (EA) and Pacific (PA) blockings, even after 216 -hr lead time, whereas they did not simulate well the frequencies of Greenland and Ural blockings, even {{in the middle of}} the forecast range. The ensemble forecasts are not always able to capture the blockings with high probability in the latter half of the forecast range. During this latter half, blocked flows were frequently predicted with low probability during the active <b>blocking</b> <b>period,</b> whereas they were seldom predicted with similar probability during the non-active <b>blocking</b> <b>period.</b> This result might suggest that the active <b>blocking</b> <b>period</b> is more chaotic than the non-active <b>blocking</b> <b>period.</b> In addition, it was more difficult to predict an onset of EA blocking than to predict an onset of PA blocking, and probabilistic blocking forecasting over the PA sector was more skillful than that over the EA sector. These results suggest that PA blocking has a higher predictability than does AT blocking...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the arrival}} of calls (i. e., new and handoff calls) in a {{personal}} communications services (PCS) network is modeled by a Markov arrival process (MAP) in which we allow correlation of the interarrival times among new calls, among handoff calls, {{as well as between}} these two kinds of calls. The PCS network consists of homogeneous cells and each cell consists of a finite number of channels. Under the conditions that both cell’s residence time and the requested call holding time possess the general phase type (PH) distribution, we obtain the distribution of the channel holding times, the new call blocking probability and the handoff call failure probability. Furthermore, we prove that the cell residence time is PH distribution if and only if • the new call channel holding time is PH distribution; or • the handoff call channel holding time is PH distribution; or • the call channel holding time is PH distribution; provided that the requested call holding time is a PH distribution and the total call arrival process is a MAP. Also, we prove that the actual call holding time of a non-blocked new call is a mixture of PH distributions. We then developed the Markov process for describing the system and found the complexity of this Markov process. Finally, two interesting measures for the network users, i. e., the duration of new call <b>blocking</b> <b>period</b> and the duration of handoff call <b>blocking</b> <b>period,</b> are introduced; their distributions and the expectations are then obtained explicitly...|$|E

40|$|Mobile {{distributed}} systems raise new {{issues such as}} mobility, low bandwidth of wireless channels, disconnections, limited battery power and lack of reliable stable storage on mobile nodes. In minimum-process coordinated checkpointing, some processes may not checkpoint for several checkpoint initiations. In {{the case of a}} recovery after a fault, such processes may rollback to far earlier checkpointed state and thus may cause greater loss of computation. In all-process coordinated checkpointing, the recovery line is advanced for all processes but the checkpointing overhead may be exceedingly high. To optimize both matrices, the checkpointing overhead and the loss of computation on recovery, we propose a hybrid checkpointing algorithm, wherein an all-process coordinated checkpoint is taken after the execution of minimum-process coordinated checkpointing algorithm for a fixed number of times. Thus, the Mobile nodes with low activity or in doze mode operation may not be disturbed in the case of minimum-process checkpointing and the recovery line is advanced for each process after an all-process checkpoint. Additionally, we try to minimize the information piggybacked onto each computation message. For minimum-process checkpointing, we design a blocking algorithm, where no useless checkpoints are taken and an effort has been made to optimize the blocking of processes. We propose to delay selective messages at the receiver end. By doing so, processes are allowed to perform their normal computation, send messages and partially receive them during their <b>blocking</b> <b>period.</b> The proposed minimum-process blocking algorithm forces zero useless checkpoints at the cost of very small blocking...|$|E

In coordinated checkpointing, if asingle process fails to take its checkpoint; all the checkpointing effort goes waste, because, each process has to abort its tentative checkpoint. In order to take its tentative checkpoint, an MH needs to transfer large checkpoint data to its local MSS over wireless channels. The checkpointing effort may be exceedingly high due to frequent aborts especially in mobile systems. We try to minimize the loss of checkpointing effort when any process fails to take its checkpoint in coordination with others...|$|E

Besides, a higher value for tmax can result in less number of handovers and can be tolerated by non-real-time applications. However for real-time applications, there is the need to limit the maximum value of dwell timer. In this work, we choose tmax from multiples of conventional dwell time values and perform simulation to find the optimum value.
