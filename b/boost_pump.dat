5|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{performed}} {{tests on}} {{parts of the}} DC-4 fuel system. Tests on the engine fuel system showed that when the engine <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> was operating, a vortex formed in the engine fuel tank. If {{a small amount of}} water was present, this vortex held the water in suspension and prevented it from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> was turned off, the vortex dissipated and any water would soon find its way into the engine. Investigators believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} CAB and included two hearings where, among others, the surviving captain and flight engineer testified. Based on their investigation, the CAB concluded that the momentary fuel pressure fluctuations in the number 3 and 4 (right side) engines noticed by the flight engineer during takeoff, were most likely caused by a <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> failure, and did not necessitate any action {{as long as the}} engines kept running normally. According to the CAB, by opening the cross-feed valves between the number 3 and 4 fuel tanks, and leaving them open with the <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> on for much of the flight, the flight engineer most likely caused the number 4 tank to run dry, resulting in the failure of both right side engines due to fuel exhaustion or starvation during the final flight segment.|$|E
5|$|In April 1951 Justice Simpson {{advised the}} Minister for Civil Aviation that new {{evidence}} had become available. The Minister gave permission for the Inquiry to be re-opened. The Inquiry re-opened in Melbourne on 4 June 1951. The Department of Civil Aviation had recently completed {{tests on the}} DC-4 fuel system. The tests showed that when an engine <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> was operating, a vortex in the engine fuel tank prevented water from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> was turned off, any water would soon {{find its way into}} the engine. The Department of Civil Aviation believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off. However, Justice Simpson stated that the re-opened Inquiry served only to confirm his view that the Amana's loss of power was not due to water in the fuel.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the propellant turbopumps, staged combustion engines often require smaller <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> so to prevent both preburner backflow and turbopump cavitation. For example, the RD-180 and RS-25 use <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> driven by tap-off and expander cycles, as well as pressurized tanks, to incrementally increase propellant pressure prior to entering the preburner.|$|R
50|$|Most Learjet 25 {{aircraft}} were {{fitted with}} a fuselage tank. The fuselage tank can be filled by the wing <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> through the transfer line and the fuel transfer valve. When the tank is full, a float switch de-energizes the wing <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> and closes the valve. During fuel transfer, the fuselage tank transfer pump pumps fuel into the both wing tanks.|$|R
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was fuel starvation resulting from the captain's decision not to follow approved fuel crossfeed procedures. Different output pressure settings on the fuel <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> coupled with the open crossfeed valve resulted in both engines drawing fuel from the left tank. All of the fuel from the airplane's left tank that was not used by the engines was transferred into the right tank due to the pressure differential between the <b>boost</b> <b>pumps.</b> During the airplane's descent to landing, the fuel in the left fuel tank became exhausted. Both engine-driven fuel pumps drew air from the exhausted left tank into the fuel system, resulting in a dual-engine flameout.|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} {{areas of}} liquid and vapor flow were analyzed and experimentally evaluated; 1) the refilling of capillary devices with settled liquid, and 2) vapor flow across wetted screens. These investigations resulted in: 1) {{the development of}} a versatile computer program that was successfully correlated with test data and used to predict Centaur D- 1 S LO 2 and LH 2 start basket refilling; 2) {{the development of a}} semi-empirical model that was only partially correlated with data due to difficulties in obtaining repeatable test results. Also, a comparison was made to determine the best propellant management system for the Centaur D- 1 S vehicle. The comparison identified the basline Centaur D- 1 S system (using pressurization, <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> and propellant settling) as the best candidate based on payload weight penalty. However, other comparison criteria and advanced mission condition were identified where pressure fed systems, thermally subcooled <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> and capillary devices would be selected as attractive alternatives...|$|R

50|$|It {{is thought}} the vapors ignited due to damaged wiring, as no bomb, {{incendiary}} device or detonator {{had been found}} at the scene. The airline had fitted logo lights after delivery which required passing additional wires through the vapor seals in the fuel tanks. The NTSB recommended to the FAA that an Airworthiness Directive be issued requiring inspections of the fuel <b>boost</b> <b>pumps,</b> float switch and wiring looms as signs of chafing had been found. The FAA declined to issue the Airworthiness Directive.|$|R
50|$|The {{failure was}} {{traced to the}} Centaur <b>boost</b> <b>pumps,</b> but the cause was still unclear, thought likely to be either ice or debris. To reduce the chance of another similar failure, pre-launch {{procedures}} to verify Centaur's pumps were free and unobstructed were put in place. It took nearly four years to trace {{the cause of the}} failure, which was an improperly-installed mounting bracket inside the LOX tank. This bracket held a LOX regulator in place and the technician responsible for installing it had found that the normal tool used to screw bolts into place was too short to reach the bracket. He thus used a slightly longer socket wrench which gave him more reach. The technician had since retired and failed to inform his successor about this. The new technician thus attempted to attach the bolt with the wrench specified in the assembly instructions, which was too short and prevented him from screwing it into place properly. The bolt came loose, fell off, and got sucked into one of the LOX <b>boost</b> <b>pumps,</b> jamming it and preventing it from operating. Despite the failure, at least one important goal was accomplished in that the bulging Centaur payload shroud was proven to be aerodynamically stable in flight and had jettisoned properly and on schedule.|$|R
40|$|Engine firing tests, using a {{full-scale}} flight-weight vehicle, {{were performed to}} evaluate a pressurized propellant feed system for the Centaur. The pressurant gases used were helium and hydrogen. The system was designed to replace the <b>boost</b> <b>pumps</b> currently used on Centaur. Two liquid oxygen tank pressurization modes were studied: (1) directly into the ullage and (2) below the propellant surface. Test results showed the two Centaur RL 10 engines could be started and run over the range of expected flight variables. No system instabilities were encountered. Measured pressurization gas quantities agreed well with analytically predicted values...|$|R

40|$|Municipal water {{delivery}} networks face increasing demands due to popu-lation growth. We focus on enhancing a water utility’s infrastructure {{to meet its}} growing demands in a cost effective manner. Specifically, we consider the problem of placing pressure <b>boosting</b> <b>pumps</b> in a water network such that the minimum required delivery pressure is maintained at all the consumption points in the network for a given demand and the pump placement costs are minimized. The cost could be either energy cost or total cost dollars. Iterative optimization strategies and evolutionary computation techniques are typically used for solving such enhancement problems. We take a different perspective exploiting {{the structure of the}} network using graph theoretic principles. For water networks with tree topologies, we determine the optimal pump placement in terms of energy costs. We find that this energy optimal solution need not always minimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) involved in the pump placement. Therefore, we propose heuristic methodologies that reduce the TCO involved in placing pressure <b>boosting</b> <b>pumps</b> in tree networks. For water networks with complex topologies involving loops, we use the best of our tree solutions to find the initial seeds for iterative search strategies such as genetic algorithms (GA) and successive linear programming (SLP). We use EPANET for hydraulic modeling and study the efficacy of the proposed solution in terms of the TCO. In real-world topologies we considered, our heuristic seeding improves the performance of GA and SLP by about 68 % and 26 % respectively. 1...|$|R

50|$|The Learjet 25 {{generally}} has five fuel tanks. Two wing tanks, a fuselage tank and two wing tip tanks. Each wing tank {{extends from the}} centre bulkhead outboard to the wing tip and provides separate fuel for each engine. A tank cross-flow valve is installed to prevent fuel transfer between wing tanks. Flapper-type check valves, located in the various wing ribs, allow free fuel flow inboard but restrict outboard flow. A jet pump and electrical <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> are mounted in each wing tank near the centre bulkhead to supply fuel under pressure to the respective engine fuel system.|$|E
5000|$|Vapor lock {{typically}} {{occurs in}} fuel systems where a mechanically-driven fuel pump {{mounted on the}} engine draws fuel from a tank mounted lower than the pump. The reduced pressure in the line can cause the more volatile components in automotive gasoline to flash into vapor, forming bubbles in the fuel line and interrupting fuel flow. If an electric <b>boost</b> <b>pump</b> is mounted in the fuel tank to push fuel toward the engine, as is common practice in fuel-injected automobiles, the fuel pressure in the lines is maintained above ambient pressure, preventing bubble formation. Likewise, if the fuel tank is mounted above the engine and fuel flows primarily due to gravity, as in a high-wing airplane, vapor lock cannot occur, using either aviation or automotive fuels. Fuel-injected engines in automobiles also usually have a [...] "fuel return" [...] line to send unused fuel back to the tank, which has the benefit of equalizing the fuel's temperature throughout the system, further reducing the chance for vapor lock from developing.|$|E

50|$|Investigation {{into the}} failure {{found that a}} minor fatigue crack {{developed}} in the Centaur LOX tank during staging and orbital injection, which eventually led to complete tank failure and loss of the mission.

To compensate for this, LOX tank pressure was increased 25%. Although the tank had been designed to accommodate higher pressure, technicians at Convair inexplicably failed to test Centaur 5402 for leaks before shipping it to Cape Canaveral. In addition, engineers had not tested the Centaur G stages to verify if they could handle the shock from the explosive bolts on the booster firing during staging, but this test was performed later and the stage passed it.|$|R
