5000|$|About Smith's second book, Duende, Elizabeth Alexander writes, [...] "Tracy K. Smith synthesizes {{the riches}} of many discursive and poetic traditions without regard to {{doctrine}} and with great technical rigor. Her poems are mysterious but utterly lucid and write a history that is sub-rosa yet fully within her vision. They are deeply satisfying and necessarily inconclusive. And they are pristinely beautiful without ever being precious. Writers and musicians have explored the concept of duende, which might in English translate {{to a kind of}} existential blues. Smith is not interested in sadness, per se. Rather, in the strange music of these poems I think Smith is trying to walk us close to the edge of death-in-life, the force of hovering death in both the personal and social realms, admitting its inevitability and sometimes-proximity, and understand its manifestations in quotidian acts. This dark force is nonetheless a life force, which, in the poem 'Flores Woman,' concludes 'Like a dark star. I want to last' If Duende were wine, it would certainly be red; if edible, it would be meat cooked rare, coffee taken black, stinky cheese, <b>bittersweet</b> <b>chocolate.</b> Tracy K. Smith's music is wholly her own, and Duende is a dolorous, beautiful book." ...|$|E
