40|$|ABSTRACT Egg {{size and}} {{functional}} qualities differ among strains of com-mercial turkeys. Thus, energy budgets of egg contents and eggshell conduc-tance constants may represent different strategies for hatching and more energy may be expended by some strains than others. The {{objective of the}} present study was to determine the effects on poult quality of holding hatchling poults <b>in</b> the <b>incubator</b> for 12 or 24 h posthatching. Eggs from three strains of commercial turkey breeder hens were obtained from a commercial turkey breeding company, numbered, randomly distributed, and set <b>in</b> <b>incubators.</b> The time of hatching of each egg was observed at 4 -h intervals and a random sample of hatchlings emerging from the shell at 648 and 660 h of incubation was compared with poults kept <b>in</b> the <b>incubator</b> until 672 h of incubation. Holding poults <b>in</b> <b>incubators</b> 12 or 24 h posthatching reduced (P <. 05) total body weight of all strains examined but increased (P <. 05) relative heart and liver weights. Holding time interacted (P <,. 05) with strain of turkey to increase blood plasma glucose and decrease heart glycogen. Holding decreased (P <. 001) liver glycogen precipitously in all three strains. It was concluded that holding poults <b>in</b> <b>incubators</b> 12 or 24 h posthatching has detrimental effects on carbohydrate metabolism and some strains of turkeys respond to the holding time better than others. Therefore, poult quality of commercial turkey strains may be affected differently by keeping them <b>in</b> the <b>incubator</b> posthatching.

40|$|Summary: The authors {{compared}} axillary skin temperatures (AT) {{measured with}} an infrared (IR) thermometer (Lightouch Neonate, Exergen Corp) with rectal temperatures (RT) in 16 newly born term infants under radiant warmers (RW) and in cribs. Twelve stable, growing premature infants <b>in</b> <b>incubators</b> were also studied. This new device {{may be useful}} because of safety and rapid results (1 second), but clinical accuracy is unknown. For term infants, mean (SD) RT-AT difference was 0. 1 (0. 48) 0 C under RW and 0. 25 (0. 17) 0 C 2 hours later in cribs. For premature infants <b>in</b> <b>incubators</b> the mean RT-AT difference was 0. 09 (0. 16) °C. Axillary temperatures measured by IR thermometer approximate RT for newly born term infants in cribs and stable premature infants <b>in</b> <b>incubators.</b> For newly born term infants under RW, RT-AT differences vary more widely, limiting clinical usefulness in this setting.

40|$|Motivated by the {{increased}} resurgence of emerging markets, this dissertation draws from a milieu of academic disciplines and professional experiences {{to study a}} previously undocumented phenomenon. This study empirically measures the increase in emerging market firm (EMF) absorptive capacity obtained during their developed market entry by participating <b>in</b> <b>incubators</b> <b>in</b> the United States. This study lays out both a theoretical and an empirical model of product commercialization focusing on absorptive capacity and the moderating effect of incubator participation. The study employs a sample of high-technology firms from Mexico entering the United States during the time period from 2009 to 2011. The central question this study seeks to answer is: How does incubator participation make EMF developed market entry more successful? This study answers two additional questions: How does incubator participation increase EMFs absorptive capacity relevant to product commercialization? and How does the increase in such absorptive capacity (e. g., technological learning, market learning) lead to improved performance of developed market product commercialization success? While the hypotheses were not directly supported, {{this study showed that}} EMFs that participate <b>in</b> <b>incubators</b> are associated with higher economic performance as a result of developed market entry, and that EMFs that participate <b>in</b> <b>incubators</b> are associated with greater organizational learning. While causation was not demonstrated via significant regression results, other statistical tests support the general premises of both of my hypotheses. This study concludes by identifying areas for future research regarding the influence of absorptive capacity and social capital on emerging market firm developed market entry. ...|$|R

The objective of our work has been to follow bacteroflora between the third and the eighth week of their lives. During 35 days of experiment bacteroflora of rainbow trout has been examined, along with following physico–chemical characteristics of water quality as well as it’s influence on health. Samples for bacteriological examination were taken from gill, heart and kidney areas and innoculated on the plates. Bacterial colonies were examined macroscopically, slides with Gram staining, and afterwords biochemical tests were performed. For identification, APILAB Plus programme (bio Mérieux, France) was used. Bacterial population of rainbow trout larvae and fry changed in dependence with their age. Physico–chemical characteristics of water ranged within optimal values. Most of bacterial colonies originated from gill isolates (64, 4 %), than from heart (21, 8 %) and kidney areas (13, 8 %). The bacterial flora of larvae <b>in</b> <b>incubator</b> was composed mostly of Gram–positive bacteria (75, 1 %), genera: Renibacterium (25 %), Lactobacillus (16, 7 %), Staphilococcus (16, 7 %) and Corynebacterium (16, 7 %).

Gram–negative bacteria, which have been represented <b>in</b> larvae <b>in</b> <b>incubator</b> with low percent (24, 9 %), after the transfer of larvae to the pools became dominant and represented more than 95 % of rainbow trout larvae and fry bacterial flora.

Cases were then seen {{all over the world}} and the cause was, at that point, unknown.

Two British scientists suggested that it was oxygen toxicity that caused the disease. Babies born prematurely in such affluent areas were treated <b>in</b> <b>incubators</b> which had artificially high levels of oxygen.

40|$|It {{has been}} widely argued that {{networks}} are critical for innovative firms. In the effort to support the growth of these firms, incubators seem to institutionalize support by having systems in place to encourage networking and help firms develop networks with other tenants and potential business allies. However, {{there is a lack}} of critical empirical investigation of the different types of networks developed by firms. This paper addresses this issue by systematically examining how firms <b>in</b> <b>incubators</b> develop their networks and what types of networks they might aim to build. The study is based on a survey with firms located at Daresbury Science and Innovation Centre in the UK. The results suggest that incubators often generalize their network support without considering that firms may develop different networks based on their needs. The results also demonstrate that the characteristics of firms do play a role in determining types of network. Science and engineering firms develop networks that differ from those of service and IT firms due to their need to access resources from other innovative firms <b>in</b> <b>incubators,</b> from the Science and Technology Facilities Council and from universities. Similarly, small firms are forced to establish internal and external networks in an attempt to compensate for their lack of resources. Overall, the findings suggest that academic theory on networks of firms <b>in</b> <b>incubators</b> needs to be more nuanced and that the networking support provided by incubators needs to be customized to the actual needs of the incubating firms...|$|R
