This paper presents a new feature-based ap- proach for smooth surfaces. Here, the smooth surfaces are assumed to be 2 -dimensional @differentiable manifolds within a theoretical framework. As the shape features, critical points such as peaks, pits, and passes are used. We also use a critical point graph called the R. eeb graph to represent the topological skeletons of a smooth object.

In our method, the shape design process begins with specifying the topological skeletons using the Reeb graph. The Reeb graph is edited by pasting the enti- ties called cells that have one-to-one correspondences with the critical points. In addition to the topological skeletons, users also design the geometry of the objects with smooth surfaces by specifying the flow curves that run on the object surface.

40|$|Considering design efficiency, it is {{desirable}} to construct a 3 D product model with user-friendly sketch inputs and by reusing existing knowledge. For definition, a semantic feature {{is defined as a}} group of related abstract entities, relations, and rules, to support sketch. The abstract entities are augmented with sketch entities to support sketch-based feature retrieval; relations are extended with inclusion relation and corresponding relation to support sketch-based feature instantiation; rules are added to encode domain knowledge to resolve a sketch’s ambiguity. A semantic feature model is constructed from conceptual layer, to feature layer, and to sketch layer. Differently, its feature layer contains a set of feature subspaces and its shape is detailed via sketch by corresponding relations. For representation, a new non-manifold boundary representation (<b>B-reps)</b> —Q-Complex with inclusion topology, is proposed to represent semantic feature models. Inclusion topology, allowing one entity to be embedded into another entity, is used to explicitly represent the relative positions among semantic features.

40|$|M-reps are a {{multiscale}} {{approach to}} the modeling and rendering of 3 D solid geometry. Traditional geometric models, whether <b>b-reps</b> or CSG, are represented at infinitesimal spatial scale and then require simplification to meet needs requiring coarser scale or smaller data sets. We have developed a model that is designed at successively smaller scales and supports a coarse-to-fine hierarchy in design, rendering, physical deformation, and other graphics operations. We base our representation on figural models, defined at coarse scale by a hierarchy of figures – protrusions, indentations, corners, neighboring figures, and included figures – which simultaneously represent solid regions and their boundaries. To capture local shape at scale and thus local zoom-invariance, the figural components imply a fuzzy, i. e., probabilistically described boundary position with a width- and scale-proportional tolerance. At small scale these figures are made precise by displacement maps, geometric textures, or image textures. While these models can exist in 2 D, we focus on models of 3 D objects. We note {{the needs of a}} variety of graphics operations and thus motivate the following definition of an m-rep. A model for a single figure is made from a mesh of medial atoms (hence the name m-reps), each atom describing not only a position and width, but also a local figural frame implying figural directions, and an object angle between opposing, corresponding positions on the implied boundary.

In this paper, we develop a new subdivision scheme which can interpolate all of the initial control points in 3 D and generate a continuous volume in the limit. We devise a set of solid subdivision rules to facilitate a simple subdivision procedure. The conversion between the subdivided mesh and a simplicial complex is straightforward and effective, which can be directly utilized in solid meshing, finite element simulation, and other numerical processes. In principle, our solid subdivision process is a combination of simple linear interpolations in 3 D. Affine operations of neighboring control points produce new control points in the next level, yet inherit the original control points and achieve the interpolatory effect. A parameter is offered to control the tension between control points. The interpolatory property of our solid subdivision offers many benefits which are desirable in many design applications and physics simulations, including intuitive manipulation on control points and ease of constraint enforcement in numerical procedures. We outline a proof that can guarantee the convergence and C continuity of our volumetric subdivision and limit volumes in regular cases. In addition to solid subdivision, we derive special rules to generate C surfaces as <b>B-reps</b> and to model shapes of non-manifold topology. Several examples demonstrate the ability of our subdivision to handle complex manifolds easily. Numerical experiments and future research suggestions for extraordinary cases are also presented...|$|R

40|$|The resent {{shift of}} {{attention}} in the architectural discourse towards issues of ecological design, coupled with the undeniable role of computation, has already cast a new operative role {{to the notion of}} environment. Instead of being the passive, conceptualized or historicized context of an architectural object, environment is quite literally becoming the object of design itself. We are moving away from the imposed-preconceived Cartesian object which negotiates through its boundaries its presence within its immediate context. The discipline is already considering an architecture in which architectural form is only an instance of a designed environment. In many respects, this new understanding of environment aspires to be actively designed as a closed system of constant transformation, an autonomous milieu of exchange at all scales and all levels between substances, properties or qualities. The object of investigation in Software Tectonics is how technologies of design and construction allow newly forming propositions about the role of environment in the discipline to become operational tactics in the design practice. SOFTWARE TECTONICS proposes 3 design research projects. VSpace is a computer drawing application for designers. Unlike traditional CAD systems that work primarily by representing boundaries (<b>B-reps),</b> VSpace derives form by the representation and direct manipulation of properties (P-reps) in space.

40|$|Constructing spline {{models for}} isogeometric {{analysis}} {{is important in}} integrating design and analysis. Converting designed CAD (Computer Aided Design) models with <b>B-reps</b> to analysis-suitable volumetric T-spline is fundamental for the integration. In this thesis, we work on two directions to achieve this: (a) using Boolean operations and skeletons to build polycubes for feature-preserving high-genus volumetric T-spline construction; and (b) developing weighted T-splines with arbitrary degree for T-spline surface and volume modeling {{which can be used}} for analysis. In this thesis, we first develop novel algorithms to build feature-preserving polycubes for volumetric T-spline construction. Then a new type of T-spline named the weighted T-spline with arbitrary degree is defined. It is further used in converting CAD models to analysis-suitable volumetric T-splines. An algorithm is first developed to use Boolean operations in CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) to generate polycubes robustly, then the polycubes are used to generate volumetric rational solid T-splines. By solving a harmonic field with proper boundary conditions, the input surface is automatically decomposed into regions that are classified into topologically either a cube or a torus. Two Boolean operations, union and difference, are performed with the primitives and polycubes are generated by parametric mapping. With polycubes, octree subdivision is carried out to obtain a volumetric T-mesh. The obtained T-spline surface is C 2 -continuous everywhere except the local region surrounding irregular nodes, where the surface continuity is elevated from C 0 to G 1. B´ezier elements are extracted from the constructed solid T-spline models, which are further used in isogeometric analysis. The Boolean operations preserve the topology of the models inherited from design and can generate volumetric T-spline models with better quality. Furthermore, another algorithm is developed which uses skeleton as a guidance to the polycube construction. From the skeleton of the input model, initial cubes in the interior are first constructed. By projecting corners of interior cubes onto the surface and generating a new layer of boundary cubes, the entire interior domain is split into different cubic regions. With the splitting result, octree subdivision is performed to obtain T-spline control mesh or T-mesh. Surface features are classified into three groups: open curves, closed curves and singularity features. For features without introducing new singularities like open or closed curves, we preserve them by aligning to the parametric lines during subdivision, performing volumetric parameterization from frame field, or modifying the skeleton. For features introducing new singularities, we design templates to handle them. With a valid T-mesh, we calculate rational trivariate T-splines and extract B´ezier elements for isogeometric analysis. Weighted T-spline basis functions are designed to satisfy partition of unity and linear independence. The weighted T-spline is proved to be analysis-suitable. Compared to standard T-splines, weighted T-splines have less geometrical constraint and can decrease the number of control points significantly. Trimmed NURBS surfaces of CAD models are reparameterized with weighted T-splines by a new edge interval extension algorithm, with bounded surface error introduced. With knot interval duplication, weighted T-splines are used to deal with extraordinary nodes. With B´ezier coefficient optimization, the surface continuity is elevated from C 0 to G 1 for the one-ring neighborhood elements. Parametric mapping and sweeping methods are developed to construct volumetric weighted T-splines for isogeometric analysis. Finally, we develop an algorithm to construct arbitrary degree T-splines. The difference between odd degree and even degree T-splines are studied in detail. The methods to extract knot intervals, calculate new weights to handle extraordinary nodes, and extract B´ezier elements for analysis are investigated with arbitrary degrees. Hybrid degree weighted Tspline is generated at designated region with basis functions of different degrees, for the purpose of performing local p-refinement. We also study the convergence rate for T-spline models of different degrees, showing that hybrid degree weighted T-splines have better performance after p-refinement. In summary, we develop novel methods to construct volumetric T-splines based on polycube and sweeping methods. Arbitrary degree weighted T-spline is proposed, with proved analysis-suitable properties. Weighted T-spline basis functions are used to reparameterize trimmed NURBS surfaces, handling extraordinary nodes, based on which surface and volumetric weighted T-spline models are constructed for isogeometric analysis...|$|R
