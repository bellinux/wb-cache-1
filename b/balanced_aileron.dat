2500|$|After the end {{of world}} War I some Caudron C.23s, a large trimotor night bomber, were {{modified}} to act as passenger aircraft, but the C.25 was the first aircraft Caudron had designed from the beginning to carry passengers. It was large, with a [...] span, so Caudron built in hinges to allow the wings to be folded for easier handling on the ground. The wings were rectangular in plan, mounted without stagger and fabric covered. It was a three bay biplane with unusually thin, wooden, parallel, vertical interplane struts, assisted by flying wires of thicker than usual gauge. [...] The engine mountings, two pairs of parallel struts, defined the inner bay. The outer pair of these struts were doubled since this was where the wing folded and so the ends of the wing either side of the fold retained their struts. [...] Four vertical cabane struts braced the centre of the upper wing from the upper fuselage. There were ailerons on both lower and lower planes, extending over more than half the span. These were not aerodynamically balanced in the usual way but were connected to each other by three vertical rods which halfway up were hinged to the trailing edge of a narrower and shorter horizontal surface which rotated about an axis well behind its aerodynamic centre. The wires from the cockpit operated these ancillary surfaces, which then moved the ailerons, just as the leading edge of a conventional <b>balanced</b> <b>aileron,</b> extending forward of the hinge, assists the pilot's input.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program to}} measure the aerodynamic characteristics of the NACA 64 - 621 airfoil when equipped with plain ailerons of 0. 38 chord and 0. 30 chord and with 0. 38 chord <b>balanced</b> <b>aileron</b> has been conducted in a pressurized 6 x 12 -inch High Reynolds Number Wind Tunnel. Surface pressures were measured and integrated to yield lift and pressure drag coefficients for angles of attack from - 3 deg to + 42 deg, and for selected aileron deflections from 0 to - 90 deg at nominal Mach and Reynolds numbers of 0. 25 and 5 x l 0 exp 6, respectively. When resolved into thrust coefficient for wind turbine aerodynamic control applications, the data indicated the anticipated decrease in thrust coefficient with negative aileron deflection at low angles of attack; however, as angle of attack increased, thrust coefficients eventually became positive. All aileron configurations, even at - 90 deg deflections, showed this trend. Hinge moments for each configuration complete the data set...|$|E

25|$|The {{new model}} {{incorporated}} {{changes to the}} aircraft's control surfaces, including enlarged and <b>balanced</b> <b>ailerons,</b> {{the addition of a}} rudder anti-servo tab, and a stabilator bobweight.|$|R
50|$|An {{improved}} {{version of}} the J.I was developed as the AEG J.II, which had aerodynamically <b>balanced</b> <b>ailerons</b> with overhanging horn balances, extended rear fuselage with a larger fin to improve directional stability and a re-located aileron link strut.|$|R
50|$|It {{was a small}} low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with a fixed tailskid {{landing gear}} and powered by a 35 hp ABC Motors Scorpion II engine. It was rebuilt in 1934 with a 90 hp Pobjoy Cataract, mass <b>balance</b> <b>ailerons</b> and a modified landing gear.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{production}} version, designated C.V/16, {{suffered from}} heavy control forces and inadequate engine cooling. Albatros therefore produced the C.V/17 {{with a new}} lower wing, as well as <b>balanced</b> <b>ailerons</b> and elevators. The fuselage-mounted radiators were replaced by a single flush radiator in the upper wing.|$|R
50|$|In 1951 an {{improved}} {{version of the}} C.800 named C.801 was designed by Raymond Jarlaud. This had a reinforced structure, an enlarged rudder and <b>balanced</b> <b>ailerons.</b> Cockpit visibility was improved by simplifying the frames with more curved glazing and ground handling was made easier by moving the monowheel forward.|$|R
50|$|The Phönix D.I was {{the second}} design {{developed}} by the Phönix Flugzeug-Werke based on Hansa-Brandenburg D.I design which it has produced under licence. The D.I was a single-seat biplane fighter with improvements over the original Hansa-Brandenburg design which included more efficient wings, a more powerful engine and structural improvements. A prototype was first flown in 1917 and proved to be fast but difficult to handle {{but because of the}} urgent need for fighters the D.I entered production. To improve the problems a modified variant, the D.II was introduced with balanced elevators and <b>balanced</b> <b>ailerons</b> on the upper wings. A further development was the D.III which had <b>balanced</b> <b>ailerons</b> on both wings and a more powerful 230 hp (172 kW) Hiero in-line engine. The last of 158 aircraft of all three types was delivered on 4 November 1918.|$|R
25|$|The Rumpler D.I (factory {{designation}} 8D1) was a fighter-reconnaissance aircraft {{produced in}} Germany {{at the end}} of World War I. It was a conventional single-bay biplane with wings of unequal span braced by I-struts. It featured an open cockpit and a fixed, tailskid undercarriage. The upper wing was fitted with aerodynamically <b>balanced</b> <b>ailerons</b> and fuselage had an oval cross-section.|$|R
50|$|The Kid has a {{welded steel}} frame structure, fabric covered. Its high wings have {{constant}} chord and are built around two spars, {{one of which}} also forms the wing leading edge. The wing carries <b>balanced</b> <b>ailerons</b> and flaps; they fold back for transport, remaining horizontal. Each wing is braced by a V-form pair of struts, assisted by jury strutting.|$|R
50|$|Both wings were {{rectangular}} in plan {{but only}} the lower one carried dihedral (3.5°) and the overhung, <b>balanced</b> <b>ailerons.</b> They were built around pairs of spars and were of mixed wood and metal construction with fabric covering; their thick sections provided internal rigidity and allowed a single-bay structure, with pairs of parallel, inward leaning interplane struts between the spars.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} camber-changing system the two wings were unremarkable; they were {{rectangular}} in plan, {{with a low}} aspect ratio of only 4.3, each joined low down onto the fuselage. On each side a pair of near-parallel struts braced the wing from the spars beyond half span to the upper fuselage. Very short and broad <b>balanced</b> <b>ailerons</b> were mounted at the tips.|$|R
50|$|The Goliath was {{initially}} designed in 1918 as a heavy bomber {{capable of carrying}} 1000 kg of bombs {{with a range of}} 1500 km. It was a fixed-undercarriage three-bay biplane of fabric-covered wood construction, powered by two Salmson Z.9 engines. It had a simple and robust, yet light structure. The wings were rectangular with a constant profile with aerodynamically <b>balanced</b> <b>ailerons</b> fitted to both upper and lower wings.|$|R
50|$|The IAR-35 is an all-metal, single seat, short span glider {{developed}} for aerobatic flight. Its three spar shoulder wing, with metal ribs and bonded metal skinning, has a constant chord centre section and tapered outer panels. There is no dihedral on the centre section but 2° outboard. The whole trailing edge {{is occupied by}} all-metal, statically <b>balanced</b> <b>ailerons,</b> each fitted with an automatic trim tab. DFS (Schempp-Hirth) airbrakes extend both {{above and below the}} wings.|$|R
2500|$|Pilots {{agreed that}} the revised forward profile changed the view from poor on the D.VI to {{excellent}} on the D.VII. During development the D.VII acquired some {{of the features of}} the D.VIb, most noticeably overhung, <b>balanced</b> <b>ailerons.</b> [...] The empennage was also modified to a form close to that of the D.VIb, with a small, lower, and broader fin and broad chord balanced rudder. The tailplane was lowered {{from the top of the}} fuselage to its midpoint.|$|R
2500|$|The D.6 was {{a single}} bay biplane with pairs of parallel, outward leaning interplane struts. There was no stagger on the leading edges, though the lower wing was smaller both in span and chord. [...] Each upper wing tip was {{supported}} over the fuselage by a N-form strut, one foot at mid-fuselage and the forward one higher. [...] The lower wing was conventionally attached to the lower fuselage. [...] The half span, broad and horn <b>balanced</b> <b>ailerons</b> were on the upper wing only.|$|R
2500|$|The Potez XVIII was {{developed}} {{into the very}} similar Potez XXII, which differed chiefly in having more powerful, uncowled [...] Bristol Jupiter radial engines. It also had an extended nose, increasing the length by [...] and an increased maximum weight of [...] The lower wing, <b>balanced</b> <b>ailerons</b> were replaced with unbalanced ailerons on both upper and lower wings. The type XXII competed in Le Grand Prix des Avions de Transport (Transport Aircraft Prize Competition), held {{in the autumn of}} 1923, though without distinction.|$|R

25|$|According to Mason, the {{controls}} of the Vampire {{were considered to be}} relatively light and sensitive, employing an effective elevator arrangement that enabled generous acceleration from relatively little control inputs along with highly <b>balanced</b> <b>ailerons</b> that could achieve high rates of roll. In comparison to the elevator and ailerons, the rudder required more vigorous actuation in order to achieve meaningful effect. Pilots converting from piston-engined types would find themselves having to adapt to the slower acceleration of turbojet engines and the corresponding need to moderate rapid throttle movements to avoid instigating a compressor stall.|$|R
2500|$|The Nimrod had {{an overall}} {{similarity}} to the Fury: {{it was a}} single-seater biplane with an open cockpit, fixed undercarriage and guns firing through the propeller. [...] Its unswept, constant chord, round-tipped wings had an unequal span and strong stagger, the latter partly to enhance the pilot's view. It was a single bay biplane braced with outward-leaning N-form interplane struts, with the upper plane held a little above the upper fuselage by cabane struts.

50|$|The Sinaia was a three bay (with struts to {{the upper}} wings from the engine nacelles) biplane. The wings carried no stagger and were of equal span, though the lower wing was narrower. There were horn <b>balanced</b> <b>ailerons</b> on all wings. The {{empennage}} was of biplane configuration with a balanced elevator on the upper plane and containing three balanced rudders. The square section fuselage placed the pilot's cockpit well forward of the engines and a third gunner's position in the extreme, slanted nose. A two wheeled main undercarriage unit was mounted under each engine.|$|R
50|$|The Peak 100 had a cantilever, shoulder-mounted, long-span wing {{of thick}} section and {{straight}} tapered plan, constructed in three parts with a 28 ft (8.53 m) centre section {{and a pair}} of 16 ft (4.88 m) outer panels. It was built around two spruce spars with birch plywood webs and had stressed birch ply skin back to the rear spar, with fabric covering behind.
