5|$|In 1938, Hitler {{decided that}} the old Reich Chancellery was not <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> house the {{ministries}} of the Third Reich. He assigned his favorite architect Albert Speer to build the new Chancellery. After the massive renovations were completed in early 1939 per Hitler's insistence, the globe {{was moved to the}} Führer's new office located {{at the heart of the}} new Chancellery, where it remained until the Soviets occupied the building in April 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, glacier caves were {{discovered}} on the then-smooth glacier surface. Many of these glacier caves were <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> explore, like the glacier caves {{on the summit}} of Mount Rainier. Most of the glacier caves were located near the 1980s lava dome, where hot steam and volcanic gas emissions from hidden fumaroles on the crater floor or lava dome melted holes in the young glacial ice. About 7,900 feet or 2.4km of underground caves and passageways in the glacier were mapped and studied.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War {{ended in}} 1945, Hampden started to host Scotland matches more frequently. Before then, Hampden had only hosted 15 matches against England and one match each against Austria and Czechoslovakia. During the post-war {{attendance}} boom, Hampden {{was the only}} stadium <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> host the crowds who {{wanted to see the}} team. Matches that would have ordinarily attracted a crowd of 40,000 were being attended by nearly 100,000. The Hampden fixture list was also expanded by the new Scottish League Cup competition. In 1947, Rangers defeated Aberdeen in the first League Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|Beginning to play {{organized}} hockey {{at the age}} of four, Hamhuis was {{competing against}} other players as old as eight years, as his hometown was not <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> fill teams for younger age groups. He went to provincials four seasons in a row and won the title with his club, the Smithers Storm, in overtime during his last year of minor hockey. Future Predators teammate Cody Franson was a stick boy for Hamhuis' team, while another Nashville blueliner, Shea Weber, did the same for a competing team at provincial tournaments. Hamhuis grew up cheering for the Edmonton Oilers and Vancouver Canucks.|$|E
5|$|The company {{continued}} to leave Rosebery Avenue for summer tours to British cities and towns. The Arts Council (successor to CEMA) was {{sensitive to the}} charge that since 1945, far fewer opera performances had been given in the provinces. The small Carl Rosa Opera Company toured constantly, but the Covent Garden company visited only those few cities with theatres <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> accommodate it. In the mid-1950s, renewed calls appeared for a reorganisation of Britain's opera companies. There were proposals for a new home for Sadler's Wells on the South Bank of the Thames near the Royal Festival Hall, which fell through because the government was unwilling to fund the building.|$|E

5|$|After {{her return}} to London in early 1937, {{recognising}} {{that she was not}} going to be a success on the stage David abandoned thoughts of a theatrical career. Later in the year she took a post as a junior assistant at the fashion house of Worth, where smart young women from upper class backgrounds were sought after as recruits. She found the subservience of retail work irksome, and resigned in early 1938. Over the next few months she spent time holidaying in the south of France and on Corsica, where she was greatly taken with the outgoing nature of the people she stayed with and the simple excellence of their food. After returning to London, and disenchanted with life there, she joined Cowan in buying a boat, just <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> suffice, with the intention of sailing it to Greece. They crossed the Channel in July 1939 and navigated the boat through the canal system of France to the Mediterranean coast.|$|E
5|$|Arévalo's {{response}} {{toward the}} non-communist unions was mixed. In 1945, he criminalized all rural labor unions in workplaces {{with fewer than}} 500 workers, which included most plantations. One of the few unions <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> survive this law was of the banana workers employed by the UFC. In 1946 this union organized a strike, which provoked Arévalo into outlawing all strikes until a new labor code was passed. This led to efforts {{on the part of}} employers to stall the labor code, as well as to exploit workers as far as possible before it was passed. The unions were also damaged when the US government persuaded the American Federation of Labor to found the Organización Regional Internacional del Trabajo (ORIT), a union that took a virulently anti-communist stance.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October 1469, Henry Percy {{had taken}} his oath of fealty to the King, and had been {{released}} from the Tower. The following year saw the return of Robin of Redesdale and another rebellion on behalf of Warwick. Montagu was forced to {{come down from the}} Scottish border to suppress it; this he did, but, one historian has suggested, albeit that he 'allowed the leaders to escape... ensuring that the rebellion could rise again' at a more opportune moment. Almost immediately, Montagu was forced to crush another rebellion, this time lead by a Robin of Holderness, but calling for the return of Percy to the Northumberland Earldom. The Redesdale rebels soon reformed into an army <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> march south and defeat a royal force at the Battle of Edgecote Moor on 26 July 1469. King Edward still accepted that Montagu was uninvolved in his brother's rebellion, and in the event, Montagu was the only Neville to accompany the king on his journey from the north back to London.|$|E

5|$|On 30 March 1999, the Council met to {{initiate}} {{planning for a}} centre to house the visual and performing arts at the former Civic Centre site in the Port Macquarie central business district. It recommended a project plan be developed by 2001. On 21 August 2000 a Cultural Facilities Taskforce was created. In December 2000, the Council approached {{the management of the}} neighbouring shopping centre, Port Central, about a possible joint venture on the site, and the Council endorsed further negotiations on 28 May 2001. The joint venture was expected to cost around A$13.5 million, with the Council contributing A$7.3 million. The joint venture collapsed in August 2002 because the Council was not prepared to accommodate the needs of their commercial partner to make the project viable, and decided to go it alone. The new centre became an icon building {{under the direction of the}} Council's General Manager, managed by a Project Control group including the Mayor and Deputy Mayor. The costs blew out considerably by 28 June 2004, when the Council unanimously backed the project, outlays had already reached A$15A$20 million, and by late 2007 they had reached A$41.7 million. This was due to a range of factors including, that the Council bought and demolished neighbouring shops to make the facility <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> include meeting rooms and conference facilities, and a drain built by convicts in the 19th century, and still in remarkably good condition, was discovered by archaeologists and needed to be preserved.|$|E
5|$|Once {{in front}} of Schumacher, Hill was able to {{gradually}} extend his lead to 3.4seconds by lap30 despite carrying a heavier fuel load for one fewer planned pit stop. However, he lost second gear {{during the course of}} that lap, and then spun off at turntwo on lap31, retiring from the race with a suspected gearbox seizure. On the same lap, Herbert also retired from the race after suffering damage in a collision with Suzuki, who himself had to make an unscheduled pit stop to replace his car's damaged nosecone. Schumacher thus assumed the lead as a result of Hill's retirement, leading by 11.5seconds from Coulthard. Salo was third in the remaining Tyrrell, 39.4seconds behind Coulthard. Häkkinen and the two Ferrari cars completed the top sixpositions. Schumacher made his secondpit stop on lap37, exiting in second position behind Coulthard. Salo and Häkkinen, both performing much better than had been expected prior to the race, battled over thirdposition until lap39, when Salo, suffering from cramp and driving with one hand, spun at the final bend. He made a pit stop soon after for fresh tyres, dropping to eighthposition. Häkkinen, having moved up to third, made his secondstop on lap43, exiting behind the two Ferrari cars, Berger moving {{in front of}} Alesi as the latter made his stop on the following lap, rejoining in seventh. Coulthard made a pit stop from the lead on lap47, the gap between him and Schumacher not <b>big</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> allow him to maintain the lead. Schumacher set the fastest lap of the race, 1:30.921, extending his lead {{to such an extent that}} when he made his own final stop on lap52, he maintained the lead. After his final stop, Schumacher gradually opened his leading margin 11seconds, winning the race after 71 laps in a time of 1:48:49.972s, with Coulthard finishing second in his Williams. The Ferrari cars of Berger – who made his final stop on lap49 without losing a place – and Alesi were third and fifth respectively, but off the pace as Schumacher lapped them both in the closing stages. Häkkinen, despite losing part of his rear wing after his car was struck by a bird, split them both to take fourth position. In the closing stages, Morbidelli and Blundell both overtook Salo, only for the Footwork driver to retire on lap62 with a blocked fuel line. Blundell, who had earlier changed his steering wheel and was driving without the use of third gear, thus took the final point in sixth place, ahead of Salo, Suzuki, Montermini – who completed the race distance despite struggling with a broken floor on his chassis, taking the Pacific team's first race finish – and Diniz. The race saw a high attrition rate; only ten out of the 25 starters finished the race. Of the other late retirements, Wendlinger suffered a broken battery cable on lap41, Roberto Moreno and Badoer retired on lap47 due to a spin and gearbox problem respectively, and Inoue's car caught fire on lap48. The Japanese driver was in any case due to receive the black flag for receiving an illegal push-start from the marshals following a spin on the circuit.|$|E
