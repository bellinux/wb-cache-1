There are hopes for applying nanorobots in medicine, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{easy to do}} such a thing because of several drawbacks of such devices. Nevertheless, progress on innovative materials and methodologies has been demonstrated with some patents granted about new nanomanufacturing devices for future commercial applications, which also progressively helps in the development towards nanorobots with the use of embedded nanobioelectronics concepts.|$|E
25|$|Notches {{on top of}} the {{cassette}} shell indicate the type of tape. Type I cassettes have only write-protect notches, Type II have an additional pair next to the write protection ones, and Type IV (metal) have a third set near the middle of the top of {{the cassette}} shell. These allow later cassette decks to detect the tape type automatically and select the proper bias and equalization. Virtually all recent hi-fi systems (with cassette decks) lack this feature; only a small niche of cassette decks (hi-fi separates) have the tape type selector. Playing Type II and IV tapes on a player without detection will produce exaggerated treble, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> noticeable because such devices typically have amplifiers that lack extended high-frequency output. Recording on these units, however, results in very low sound reproduction, and sometimes distortion and noise is heard. Also, these cheaper units cannot erase high bias or metal bias tapes. Attempting to do so will result in an incomplete erasure. This {{is due to the fact}} that the bias levels for high and metal position require greater levels.|$|E

500|$|There are {{a couple}} of noted Cabernet Sauvignon flavors that are intimately tied to viticultural and climate influences. The most widely {{recognized}} is the herbaceous or green bell pepper flavor caused by pyrazines, which are more prevalent in underripened grapes. Pyrazine compounds are [...] present in all Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and are gradually destroyed by sunlight as the grape continues to ripen. To the human palate this compound is detectable in wines with pyrazine levels as low as [...] 2 nanograms (ng) per liter. At the time of veraison, when the grapes first start to fully ripen, there is the equivalent pyrazine level of 30ng/l. In cooler climates, it is difficult to get Cabernet Sauvignon grapes to ripen fully to the point where pyrazine is not detected. The green bell pepper flavor is not considered a wine fault <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> desirable to all consumers' tastes. The California wine region of Monterey was noted in the late 20th century for its very vegetal Cabernet Sauvignon with pronounced green pepper flavor, earning the nickname of [...] "Monterey veggies". In addition to its cool climate, Monterey is also prone to being very windy, which can have the effect of shutting down the grape vines and further inhibiting ripeness.|$|E

One reason for the absence of a response to Alcock's challenge may have been different football codes being followed in Scotland at the time.

2500|$|However, {{if we use}} {{very large}} blocks, then the {{estimate}} of per-character entropy rate may become artificially low. This is because in reality, the probability distribution of the sequence is not knowable exactly; it is only an estimate. For example, suppose one considers the text of every book ever published as a sequence, with each symbol being the text of a complete book. If there are [...] published books, and each book is only published once, the estimate of the probability of each book is , and the entropy (in bits) is [...] As a practical code, this corresponds to assigning each book a unique identifier and using it {{in place of the}} text of the book whenever one wants to refer to the book. This is enormously useful for talking about books, but it is not so useful for characterizing the information content of an individual book, or of language in general: {{it is not possible to}} reconstruct the book from its identifier without knowing the probability distribution, that is, the complete text of all the books. The key idea is that the complexity of the probabilistic model must be considered. Kolmogorov complexity is a theoretical generalization of this idea that allows the consideration of the information content of a sequence independent of any particular probability model; it considers the shortest program for a universal computer that outputs the sequence. A code that achieves the entropy rate of a sequence for a given model, plus the codebook (i.e. the probabilistic model), is one such program, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> the shortest.|$|E
