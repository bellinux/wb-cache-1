40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy {{teamed with}} the National Mining Association to select {{research}} projects that could significantly benefit the mining industry. This paper describes one such project—By-Product Recovery from Mining Process Residue. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory is researching and developing the SepraDyne ® system—a high-vacuum, indirectly heated rotary kiln that operates at temperatures {{of up to}} 750 EC. The U. S. mining industry produces over 7, 000, 000 ton/yr of process residue that may contain hazardous species as well as valuable by-products. Process residues are generated by (a) smelter off-gas cleaning— 5, 500, 000 tons/yr and (b) <b>bag</b> <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> and wastewater treatment— 2, 100, 000 tons/yr (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1995). New approaches {{may be able to}} recover marketable by-products from this process residue to generate revenue and reduce disposal costs for the mining industry. For example, a rotary vacuum kiln was invented by a small U. S. business, SepraDyne®. This technology operates commercially at a copper mine separating mercury from sulfuric acid plant blowdown sludge, which also contains lead, copper, gold, and silver.

40|$|The {{present report}} {{addresses}} the issues whether <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> {{is likely to}} contribute substantially to the exposure of humans, in particular for the contaminants lead and asbestos. <b>House</b> <b>dust</b> consists for 30 - 70 % of soil material, indicating that contaminated soil can lead to contaminated <b>house</b> <b>dust.</b> It is concluded that exposure to lead via <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> {{should be included in}} risk assessment of soil contamination. The studies in which the amount of soil ingested by children are estimated use tracers in soil that are obviously both present in soil outdoors and in soil in <b>house</b> <b>dust.</b> Therefore, using this amount of soil ingested by children to cover both exposure of lead via soil outdoors and soil in <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> is reasonable. However, a correction factor of 2 is recommended to account for enrichment of lead in <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> in comparison with outdoor soil. This factor also accounts for other lead sources in <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> than contamination via soil. Significant contribution of asbestos to <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> from asbestos contaminated soil may occur at soil concentrations greater than 100 mg/kg. It is recommended to determine asbestos levels in <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> in <b>houses</b> adjacent to sites that are contaminated with asbestos above 1000 mg/kg for nonfriable asbestos, and above 100 mg/kg for friable asbestos. These recommendations are in agreement with a draft assessment protocol on site specific assessment of human risks to soil contamination with asbestos. A few comments on the protocol are made.

40|$|In {{this day}} and age, {{employee}} health safety is an extremely important issue for companies. Along with maximising profits, companies such as Sims Metal Management want {{to provide the best}} working conditions possible for their employees and minimise the risks of injury or future health concerns. Companies must do what is reasonable and practicable to ensure this. Currently in the non-ferrous recovery plant, the dust levels are sometimes too high. This causes some issues, employees must wear uncomfortable dust masks all day and causes further discomforts. It settles on machinery and on the ground. Over time this dust builds up requiring extensive cleaning and production must be stopped. Dust also increase maintenance costs and reduces the life of machinery. To combat the dust the following were completed. A high pressure water system was used to slightly dampen stored material and suppress dust plumes when this material is unloaded from the bucket of a front end loader. A <b>bag</b> <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> suction system was installed to remove as much dust as possible without overloading the suction system. A vibratory screener was modified to filter out the finer material and remove as much dirt as possible before it travelled further down the plant spilling and vibratory feeds which usually cause dust particles to become airborne. Wider conveyor belts and additional skirting systems and belt scrapers were installed to reduce the spillage. The amount of car tires entering the plant was also reduced by rearranging the magnet setup to decrease load on metal sorters and allow an increase in the processing rates in the plant...|$|E

This research aims to examine effects of BHD additions on certain properties of cement pastes, mortars and concretes, particularly those believed to affect the susceptibility of embedded steel reinforcement to chloride-induced corrosion as this is a major cause of degradation of reinforced concrete structures in the Arabian Gulf region. Studies of the effects of 2 % BHD addition on pore solution chemistry of hydrated-cement pastes with various levels of internal chloride contamination indicated that both free chloride concentration and hydroxyl ion concentration increased. Electrochemical monitoring of the corrosion behaviour of embedded steel in chloride-contaminated mortars showed that the rates of corrosion were reduced slightly in the presence of BHD. Measurements of the coarse capillary porosities of hydrated-cement pastes revealed significantly lower results in 2 - 3 % BHD-specimens compared to plain cement pastes. Attempts to measure the consequent changes in apparent diffusion coefficients of chloride in related concrete specimens showed that the BHD additions caused no adverse effects on chloride penetration rates. Electrochemical monitoring of the corrosion behaviour of steel bars embedded in mortars exposed to chloride ingress at 20 °C and 40 °C demonstrated that the threshold chloride level for the initiation of crevice corrosion was significantly increased by the presence of BHD. This was thought to be partly influenced by BHD in reducing bleeding which affects the integrity of the layer of hydration products formed around the steel surface. Having found that 2 - 3. 5 % BHD additions had no detrimental effects on the properties studied, the possibility of using chloride-free accelerators to increase levels of BHD addition without causing excessive retardation of cement hydration was investigated. Calcium nitrite and calcium formate were both found to be reasonably effective in increasing the rates of hardening of specimens with 8 % addition of BHD.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Few {{studies have}} yet {{addressed}} {{the effects of}} di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> on human nasal mucosa. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effects of <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> containing DEHP on nasal mucosa of healthy and <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite (HDM) –allergic subjects in a short-term exposure setting. METHODS: We challenged 16 healthy and 16 HDM-allergic subjects for 3 hr with <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> at a concentration of 300 µg/m 3 containing either low (0. 41 mg/g) or high (2. 09 mg/g) levels of DEHP. Exposure to filtered air served as control. After exposure, we measured proteins and performed a DNA microarray analysis. RESULTS: Nasal exposure to <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> with low or high DEHP {{had no effect on}} symptom scores. Healthy subjects had almost no response to inhaled dust, but HDM-allergic subjects showed varied responses: DEHPlow <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> increased eosinophil cationic protein, granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin (IL) - 5, and IL- 6, whereas DEHPhigh <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> decreased G-CSF and IL- 6. Furthermore, in healthy subjects, DEHP concentration resulted in 10 differentially expressed genes, whereas 16 genes were differentially expressed in HDM-allergic subjects, among them anti-Müllerian hormone, which was significantly up-regulated after exposure to DEHPhigh <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> compared with exposure to DEHPlow <b>house</b> <b>dust,</b> and fibroblast growth factor 9, IL- 6, and transforming growth factor-β 1, which were down-regulated.

Thus, <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> samples from the vacuum cleaner sacks from 72 homes in the city of Copenhagen were ana-lysed for cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb).

40|$|Background: The pathogenetic role of <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite in atopic {{dermatitis}} remains controversial. Recent {{studies have shown}} that intensive epicutaneous contact of <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite allergen with premanipulated skin may induce dematitis. It is, however, uncertain whether such conditions are met during natural contact with <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite. In the past, allergen inhalation has been suggested to induce exacerbation of {{atopic dermatitis}}. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether dermatitis could be induced in patients with atopic dermatitis by inhalation of <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite. Methods: Twenty patients with atopic dermatitis underwent bronchial provocations with <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite. Challenge tests were performed with four concentrations of a standardized <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite extract in a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled fashion. Spirometry was performed, and FEV, runs measured before and after each challenge dose. Changes in severity or localization of itching or erythema were recorded. Results: In nine of 20 patients with atopic dermatitis bronchial challenge with <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite induced unequivocal skin symptoms after 1. 5 to 17 hours. Pruritic erythematous lesions on noninvolved sites together with exacerbations of existing lesions were seen in three patients. Three patients had an exacerbation only, and three other patients had new lesions only. In eight of nine patients with <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite inhalation-induced dermatitis, skin symptoms were preceded by an early bronchial reaction. All patients with <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite-induced dermatitis had a history of asthma, and as a group they had a higher mean blood total IgE la el compared with the ''negative skirt responders. '' One patient had pruritic erythema on the placebo challenge day, without a preceding bronchoconstrictive reaction. The number of patients who had a skin response on the <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite challenge day was significantly higher than the number of patients who had a skin response on the placebo day (p = 0. 011 [Prescott's test]). Conclusions: The respiratory route may be relevant in the induction and exacerbation of dermatitis in a subset of patients with atopic dermatitis who have early bronchial reactions after <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite inhalation, a history of asthma, and an elevated blood total IgE level. Furthermore, these findings suggest a possible causal relationship between bronchial reactions and skirt reactions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite is {{the most}} {{important}} environmental allergen implicated in the aetiology of childhood asthma in the UK. Dust mite barrier bedding is relatively inexpensive, convenient to use, and of proven effectiveness in reducing mattress <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite load, but no studies have evaluated its clinical effectiveness in the control of childhood asthma when dispensed in primary care. We therefore aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite barrier bedding in children with asthma treated in primary care. Methods Pragmatic, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial conducted in eight family practices in England. Forty-seven children aged 5 to 14 years with confirmed <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite sensitive asthma were randomised to receive six months treatment with either <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite barrier or placebo bedding. Peak expiratory flow was the main outcome measure of interest; secondary outcome measures included asthma symptom scores and asthma medication usage.

Indoor pollution due to <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> is well recognized. <b>House</b> <b>dust</b> is {{an extremely}} complex and heterogeneous mixture of biological material, deposited indoor aerosols, fibers, minerals and soil particles brought in the house by foot traffic. Human exposure to <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> can cause significant health risk especially to young children due to their behaviors such as crawling and playing on dusty floors and hand to mouth behavior. Previous studies have shown the presence of smoke residues, pesticides, PAHs, PCBs, flame retardants, heavy metals and asbestos in <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> by using conventional targeted analytical methods like gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). These methods analyze the presence of only certain organic chemicals as targeted analytes, while leaving the other organic chemicals present unrecognized. Some studies have used effect-directed bio-assays which {{is a part of}} non-targeted analytical approach to detected toxicity of these unrecognized organic chemicals present in <b>house</b> <b>dust.</b> Effect directed bio-assays show the toxicity of the <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> chemicals, but still do not characterize the specific organic chemicals present in the <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> responsible for the toxicity. Here we have used a mass spectroscopy-based non-targeted analytical approach to simultaneously analyze known (targeted) and unknown (non-targeted) compounds present in <b>house</b> <b>dust.</b> We used comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time of flight mass spectrometry (GC??GC/TOF-MS) to analyze a composite <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> collected from 69 houses in San Diego county. We have recorded the presence of 8115 peaks using dispersive Solid Phase Extraction (DSPE) and 9081 peaks without using any silica Solid Phase Extraction (SPE). We determined the presence of 1011 chemicals by using the DSPE and 1094 chemicals without using any silica SPE. We chose some those chemicals likely to pose a potential health hazard to humans, especially children, and characterized them further for their toxicity and current regulation for household uses. For the first time, we discovered in this <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> sample the presence {{of a wide range of}} organic chemicals not previously recognized, including tobacco smoke products, pesticides, household/personal care products, industrial chemicals and well known recreational drugs. Many of these chemicals are highly toxic and can cause serious health problems in humans. However, only a few of them are regulated for their indoor uses.

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldBACKGROUND: <b>House</b> <b>dust</b> mites are common sources of indoor allergens. In Reykjavik, Iceland, 9 % of the young adult population had serum-specific IgE to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. Sensitization to mites is usually assumed {{to be due to}} exposure to <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mites in the indoor environment. This investigation was carried out to measure the concentrations of <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite allergens and to investigate which species of mites were present in beds in Iceland. METHODS: A total of 197 randomly selected adults were visited at home using the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) II Indoor protocol. Dust samples were collected from mattresses for measurement of <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite allergen concentrations and to estimate the number and type of <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mites. Additional samples from mattresses and floors were collected from the homes of 10 patients with positive skin prick tests (SPT) to D. pteronyssinus. <b>House</b> <b>dust</b> mite allergen concentrations were measured using ELISA and examination of mite species was carried out using microscopy. Climatic parameters were assessed using psychrometer readings in the bedrooms and outdoors. RESULTS: We found two single mite specimens, both D. pteronyssinus, in two dust samples. Mite allergen analyses indicated that two other dust samples had Der f 1 results close to the cut-off of 0. 1 microg/g of dust. No samples were positive for Der p 1. In an additional collection of dust from the homes of 10 SPT-positive patients no Dermatophagoides spp. were found. CONCLUSIONS: Reykjavik citizens are exposed to extremely low amounts of <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite allergens in their homes. Possible alternative sources for sensitization are discussed, such as bird nests, exposure from travelling abroad, or other mites or invertebrates that cross-react with <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite allergens. Our findings suggest that exposures other than to <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mites indoors are possible sources of mite allergen exposure...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic {{urticaria}} {{is one of}} the perplexing {{problems faced}} by clinicians. There are a few reports associating <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite sensitivity with chronic urticaria, based upon the patient&#x 2032;s history as well as intradermal skin testing and in vitro analysis. AIMS: To investigate the possible association between <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite sensitivity and chronic urticaria. METHODS: In this case control study three groups of patients were enrolled. Group I: Chronic urticaria (73 subjects). Group II: Chronic urticaria with collateral allergic disorders (49 subjects). Group III: Normal subjects without chronic urticaria or other allergies (25 subjects). All the patients underwent skin prick testing with antigens of the <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DP) and Dermatophagoides farinae (DF), with positive and negative controls. RESULTS: Among the patients with chronic urticaria, 78 / 122 (64 &#x 0025;) patients had skin sensitivity to <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mites. Out of these, 39 / 73 (53 &#x 0025;) had chronic urticaria alone and 39 / 49 (79 &#x 0025;) had chronic urticaria with other associated allergies. Among the normal control subjects, 7 / 25 (28 &#x 0025;) reacted positively to <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mites. CONCLUSION: This study suggests a possible association of <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite sensitivity with chronic urticaria...|$|R
40|$|<b>House</b> <b>dust</b> mites are {{animals of}} a size less than 0. 5 mm that can live in beds, carpets and {{furniture}} feeding on skin scales. They are a common source of allergy in, e. g., Scandinavia, where their major habitat is in beds. Previous studies show that in drier environments the <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite occurrence is lower, and persons with dust mite allergy have fewer symptoms during the winter when the indoor relative humidity (RH) is low. There have also been attempts to alter the microclimatic conditions in beds to reduce the <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite occurrence. The microclimatic conditions in beds have been studied both in field measurements and by modeling {{but there is still}} a lack of knowledge of how the hygrothermal material properties of the mattress and bedding affect the environmental conditions for the <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mites. This paper presents diurnal temperature and RH variations in mattresses and beddings under normal use measured for two different mattress types. The climatic results from the beds have been compared to microclimatic requirements that govern the <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mite activity levels. This study is a part of a multidisciplinary project aiming to find technical solutions for reduction of <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> mites in bedrooms by environmental control...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>House</b> <b>dust</b> mite {{is common}} aeroallergen. It can cause type 1 allergy (IgE-mediated) {{symptoms}} from dust inhalation with different spectrums of the disease. The relationship between migraine headache and aeroallergen {{has been questioned}} for many years. Objective: To report a case of migraine headaches in a child due to <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> and mite allergy and {{the course of this}} allergy after specific immunotherapy. Methods: Case report; routine skin testing and laboratory tests. Results: A 9 -year-old boy with a 2 -years history of migraine headaches every morning especially in the rainy season. Skin tests revealed positive reactions to commercial <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> extract, mite extract and Der p 1 extracts. An elevated total IgE level and specific <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> and mite IgE RAST found in the serum of patient. After 3 months of initial immunotherapy the symptoms decreased significantly. Conclusions: This case reported the rare case of childhood migraine headache due to <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> and mite allergy.

40|$|Basophil {{histamine}} release {{induced by}} allergens (<b>house</b> <b>dust</b> and Candida albicans) and anti-IgE was examined in 31 patients with bronchial asthma {{in relation to}} patient age, age at onset {{of the disease and}} serum IgE levels. Basophils from patients under 40 years of age generally released a significantly large amount of histamine by stimulation with <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> and anti-IgE. On the other hand, histamine release from patients over 41 years of age was generally not marked when the cells were incubated with <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> and anti-IgE, although, in some cases, the release induced by C. albicans was fairly marked. Basophils from patients under 30 years of age at onset were reactive to <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> and anti-IgE, while the cells from patients over 41 years of age at onset tended to be reactive only to C. albicans. Basophils from patients with low serum IgE levels were less reactive than the cells from patients with high levels of IgE to <b>house</b> <b>dust</b> and anti-IgE. C. albicans-induced release of histamine did not correlate with serum IgE levels. </p...|$|R
