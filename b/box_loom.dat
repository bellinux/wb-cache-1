25|$|The Dobcross H.K. <b>box</b> <b>loom</b> was {{manufactured}} in ca.1950 by Hutchinson, Hollingworth & Co. Ltd of Dobcross, Oldham. This loom was claimed by its makers {{to be one}} of the most widely used power looms in the woollen and worsted industries. It was used, with minor adaptations, for weaving goods as varied as light tropical suiting, costume cloths, overcoatings, army and police uniform cloths and heavy blankets. The main feature of this loom is the dobby (located top right of the loom with the hand wheel) which is known as the Knowles, American or positive wheel dobby. This device lifts and lowers the wooden shafts through which the warp ends are threaded, separating the warp threads to produce the shed. The loom has four rising or drop boxes at each side, which can be moved independently, and can weave up to seven shuttles, each with a different colour.|$|E
50|$|Abstractly {{programmable}} toolpath guidance {{began with}} mechanical solutions, {{such as in}} musical box cams and Jacquard looms. The convergence of programmable mechanical control with machine tool toolpath control was delayed many decades, {{in part because the}} programmable control methods of musical <b>boxes</b> and <b>looms</b> lacked the rigidity for machine tool toolpaths. Later, electromechanical solutions (such as servos) and soon electronic solutions (including computers) were added, leading to numerical control and computer numerical control.|$|R
25|$|Walter Whitehead {{was born}} on 12October 1840 at Haslam Hey, between Lowercroft and Walshaw in Bury, Lancashire. He was a son of John Whitehead and Eliza Ellen (n√©e Allanson). According to some sources, his family had been textile {{bleacher}}s in the Lowercroft area for well over 200 years prior to his birth, while others say that his father came from Penwortham Priory, near Preston. His father was a bleacher and perhaps also a dyer and printer of textiles. Among his relations were the inventors John Kay (flying shuttle), Robert Kay (drop <b>box</b> for weaving <b>looms)</b> and Robert Whitehead (torpedo).|$|R
