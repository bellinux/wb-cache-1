5|$|For the 2013 {{model year}} revision, Aston made minor {{changes to the}} {{bodywork}} by adapting designs from the Virage, including enlarging the recessed headlight clusters with bi-xenon lights and LED daytime strips, widening the front splitter, updating the grille and side heat extractors, updating the LED rear lights with clear lenses and integrating a new rear spoiler with the <b>boot</b> <b>lid.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lumina models sold in South Africa {{received}} updates for the 2011 model year. These {{changes were}} introduced {{to coincide with the}} release of the VE Series II Commodore. Changes include revised bumpers, there is a chrome moulding above the number plate on the <b>boot</b> <b>lid,</b> refreshed alloy wheel designs and the Holden IQ system. Also the SSV model was introduced. The Holden Ute is sold as the Lumina Ute in South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Some late model owners fitted an {{extension}} to the car's boot. This used the original <b>boot</b> <b>lid</b> and hinges, {{but in a}} horizontal position with the extension underneath.|$|E
5000|$|For 1969, the Mark II {{range was}} given subtle revisions, with {{separate}} [...] "FORD" [...] block letters {{mounted on the}} bonnet and <b>boot</b> <b>lids,</b> a blacked out grille and chrome strips on top and below the taillights running the full width of the tail panel marking them out.|$|R
50|$|Superscale is Top Gear's {{venture into}} the 1:24 scale market where larger {{versions}} of Australian cars are handmade containing over 200 pieces. These models include opening doors, bonnets and <b>boot</b> <b>lids,</b> working steering. Some models even have working window winders allowing the door windows to be wound up or down.|$|R
50|$|These {{were blue}} {{with a white}} line painted around them. In 1967, the Dunbartonshire force bought two Hillman Imps (subsequently nicknamed Pinky and Perky) for escort duties on the A82 road; one blue and one white. The <b>boot</b> <b>lids,</b> bonnets, and doors were then swapped to create a panda car style scheme.|$|R
25|$|Bonnet, horn, sharp edges, <b>boot</b> <b>lid,</b> lamps, {{steering}} wheel, {{brake pedal}} anti-slip, loading door, tailboard, direction indicators, mirrors, tailgate, doors rear reflectors, VIN, drop sides, registration plates, windscreen and glass, fuel filler cap, seat belts, wipers and washers, hazard warning, seats, wheels and tyres.|$|E
25|$|Supreme V had a {{completely}} different rear design showing the styling of the next range that was probably under development. Tall heavily featured light clusters that were tinted to look dark were fitted vertically between the <b>boot</b> <b>lid.</b> The rear window was a one piece design. The seat backs were no longer visible from outside the coach.|$|E
25|$|In {{a bid to}} stem declining sales, a 2-seat economy {{version of}} the Minicar was {{introduced}} in October 1964, the Bond 250 G Tourer. This basically used the saloon car body, but with a larger rear deck incorporating an opening <b>boot</b> <b>lid,</b> a folding hood, new fibreglass bonnet, plain door panels, no chrome side trim and non-opening quarter lights. In standard form it came with the 35A engine, but the side trim and 4T engine were available as an option.|$|E
50|$|Chassis {{construction}} {{was similar to}} most Italian supercars of that era, with square and rectangular tubing connecting the steel body to the frame. Though the 4-inch (100 mm) tubular chassis allowed both coupé and convertible versions to be rigid, the design was intricate and prone to rust. The bonnets and <b>boot</b> <b>lids</b> were fabricated from aluminum.|$|R
50|$|Retractable hardtops {{can vary}} in {{material}} (steel, plastic or aluminum), {{can vary from}} two to five {{in the number of}} rigid sections and often rely on complex dual-hinged trunk (British: <b>boot)</b> <b>lids</b> that enable the trunk lid to both receive the retracting top from the front and also receive parcels or luggage from the rear - along with complex trunk divider mechanisms to prevent loading of luggage that would conflict with the operation of the hardtop.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} hatchback, two {{two-seater}} coupé variants of the Mark III were also produced. A Drophead Coupé convertible, while not common, still considerably outnumbers the Fixed Head Coupé - 84 {{of the former}} were produced, while just five of the latter were built. All five Fixed Head Coupés were built {{close to the end}} of Mark III production and feature the mid-spec DBD engine. Both of these bodystyles feature conventional hinged <b>boot</b> <b>lids</b> rather than the innovative hatch back.|$|R
25|$|The LF-CC concept (2012) is a {{rear-wheel drive}} coupe {{incorporating}} designs from LF-LC concept and Lexus LFA. It included a 2.5-litre 4-cylinder Atkinson cycle petrol engine with D-4S direct injection technology, water-cooled permanent magnet electric motor, 3 LED-projector headlamp design, Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) are {{integrated into the}} upper bumper surface, rear spoiler integrated within the <b>boot</b> <b>lid,</b> L-shaped combination lamps with three-dimensional design, Fluid Titanium body colour, 2-zone dashboard, seats, door panels and instrument binnacle hood upholstered in amber leather. The vehicle was unveiled in 2012 Paris Motor Show, followed by Auto Shanghai 2013.|$|E
25|$|The A1 was a fully enclosed, 4-door sedan, {{with normal}} front doors and forward-opening suicide-style rear doors. It was heavily {{based on the}} Chrysler built DeSoto Airflow; Toyoda bought an Airflow and {{disassembled}} it the year before producing the A1. The front window was {{a single piece of}} flat glass with a top-mounted wiper on the driver's side. There were 3 windows per side, one for the front door (without a quarter light window), one for the rear door and one behind the rear door. A spare tyre was mounted on the nearly vertical <b>boot</b> <b>lid.</b>|$|E
25|$|The LF-CC (Lexus Future-Compact Coupe) is {{a concept}} car {{revealed}} at the October 2012 Paris Motor Show as {{a preview of the}} next generation Lexus IS. The LF-CC concept is a rear-wheel drive coupe incorporating designs from LF-LC concept and Lexus LFA. It includes a 2.5 litre 4-cylinder Atkinson cycle petrol engine with D-4S direct injection technology, water-cooled permanent magnet electric motor, 3 LED-projector headlamp design, daytime running lights integrated into the upper bumper surface, rear spoiler integrated within the <b>boot</b> <b>lid,</b> L-shaped combination lamps with three-dimensional design, Fluid Titanium body colour and a two-zone dashboard. The seats, door panels and instrument binnacle hood are upholstered in amber leather.|$|E
2500|$|Some owners {{wished to}} have more luggage {{capacity}} in the 2CV sedan. Early 2CV could be fitted with a rounded aftermarket <b>boot</b> (trunk) <b>lid,</b> reminiscent of a post-war [...] "big boot" [...] Traction Avant.|$|R
40|$|Hemming is {{a widely}} used joining {{technology}} in car body manufacturing. It is mostly used to assemble the structured inner part and the outer part of car body hang on parts like doors, hoods and <b>boot</b> <b>lids.</b> A special hemming technology is roller hemming in which a standard industrial robot is used to join the assembly parts. The properties of the robot do have a significant influence on the process quality. The paper shows {{the influence of the}} robot’s system stiffness on roller hemming processes. At first the influence of varying robot system stiffnesses on the hemming result is shown. After that a method to predict the stiffness behaviour of the robot is being introduced. The prediction method is validated and compared to real measurements in hemming experiments. Finally, the robots stiffness behaviour along a selected complex hemming path is shown and interpreted...|$|R
5000|$|The B11 {{series was}} {{regarded}} as one of Nissan's most modern ranges at the time, and was the first to abandon the Datsun name formally (though a small 'Datsun' still appeared on <b>boot</b> <b>lids</b> for the first two years). The wagon was known in its home market as the [...] "Nissan Sunny California", and Nissan installed the turbocharged engine in October 1983 for Japanese customers only. It was launched in late 1981 and continued into 1985. After the succeeding B12 had been presented, the B11 Sunny soldiered on as the [...] "Sunny 130Y" [...] as a lower-cost alternative in certain export markets, including Malaysia; production there continued well into the nineties. While a hatchback version was available for a little while in Japan (and very briefly in North America), this body style was built in comparably small numbers as the Pulsar generally replaced the hatchback in most markets. The two-door sedan was only sold in North America, with Sentra badges.|$|R
500|$|Toyota {{claims that}} the Aurion is {{designed}} to Australian tastes, {{although it has been}} designed with markets such as Asia in mind. Hogios states that the Aurion follows the traits of current Australian styling, with a tendency to look towards European designs for inspiration. In addition, like its other vehicles of similar vintage, Toyota designed the Aurion within the realm of its [...] "vibrant clarity" [...] design language. According to chief designer Hogios, the car makes particular use of the [...] "vibrant clarity" [...] theory known as [...] "perfect imbalance". This involves body features that act as a counterpoint to other body features. Examples of this include intersecting concave and convex surfaces and vertical sculpted features on the front fascia, which are balanced by the horizontal headlamps. The front-end's [...] "double concave architecture" [...] can also be characterised by its protruding bonnet crease line and deep grille. The same architecture is applied at the rear, with a deep bumper, a clamshell-shaped <b>boot</b> <b>lid</b> that envelops over the flanks, dual exhaust pipes and tail lamps. Design patents were filed on 27 December 2005 at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.|$|E
2500|$|The 1948 car {{featured}} radial tyres, {{which had}} just been commercialised; front-wheel drive; {{rack and pinion steering}} mounted inside the front suspension cross-tube, away from a frontal impact; rear fender skirts (the suspension design allowed wheel changes without removing the skirts); bolt-on detachable front and rear wings; detachable doors, bonnet (and <b>boot</b> <b>lid</b> after 1960), by [...] "slide out" [...] P-profile sheet metal hinges; flap-up windows, as roll up windows were considered too heavy and expensive.; and detachable full length fabric sunroof and <b>boot</b> <b>lid,</b> for almost pickup-like load-carrying versatility. Ventilation in addition to the sunroof and front flap windows was provided by an opening flap under the windscreen. The car had load adjustable headlights and a heater (heaters were standardised on British economy cars in the 1960s).|$|E
2500|$|In 1998 {{the special}} edition [...] "Bilstein Edition RX" [...] was offered. It could be {{identified}} by a Bilstein badge on the right rear <b>boot</b> <b>lid</b> and a lower stance due to front and rear Bilstein struts. It also featured Leather seats and door inserts along with MOMO sports leather steering wheel and 16in BBS alloys as standard equipment.|$|E
50|$|The Giulia Super {{range was}} re-released in 1974 as the Nuova Super range, {{including}} the Giulia Nuova Super 1300 and 1600 This and featured a new black plastic front grille and a flat <b>boot</b> (trunk) <b>lid</b> without the characteristic centre spine. Otherwise the cars differed little from their Giulia Super predecessors and bore the same Tipo numbers with an S suffix. Production ceased in 1977.|$|R
50|$|Like the Type 1, The Type 3 offered both {{front and}} rear luggage areas, with greater volume and easier rear cargo {{accessibility}} via a rear-opening <b>boot</b> (trunk) <b>lid.</b> Each of the 3 variants (Notchback, Squareback, and Fastback) {{as well as the}} Type 2's from 1968 on, the engine was located under a panel in the rear trunk. The Type 3 also featured wall-to-wall carpeting, and was available with air conditioning in the US.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, the Latin American Ka {{received}} a facelift which left it slightly different, externally, to the European model. The most noticeable difference {{was at the}} rear, where the number plate was moved from the bumper to the <b>boot</b> (a.k.a. trunk) <b>lid,</b> and the rear lights were made much taller.|$|R
2500|$|As usual, {{the company}} Carrozzeria Scaglietti was {{responsible}} for the manufacturing of the body. [...] The body was made of steel {{with the exception of the}} doors, <b>boot</b> <b>lid,</b> and bonnet, which were made of aluminum. The stern of the body featured a small integrated spoiler; the 250 GTL became the first Ferrari to incorporate such aerodynamic appendages, concluding with an abrupt Kammback rear.|$|E
2500|$|A {{turbodiesel}} {{version was}} introduced in late 1979, the Alfetta Turbo D, whose engine was supplied by VM Motori. Apart from a <b>boot</b> <b>lid</b> badge, the Turbo D was equipped and finished like the top-of-the-line 2000 L both outside and inside. Therefore, it received a tachometer—very unusual in diesels of this era, but no standard power steering, {{in spite of the}} additional [...] burden over the front axle.|$|E
2500|$|The Mark III Mini was {{launched}} in 1969, which was {{an updated version of}} Mark II with a modified bodyshell. The most visible changes were larger doors with concealed hinges. The <b>boot</b> <b>lid</b> lost the original hinged number plate and its recess shape and a large rear colour-coded lamp was fitted in its place, along with larger rear side windows. Sliding windows were replaced with winding windows—although some Australian-manufactured Mark I Minis had adopted this feature in 1965 (with opening quarterlight windows). The suspension reverted from Hydrolastic to rubber cones. as a cost-saving measure. Production at the Cowley plant was ended, and the simple name [...] "Mini" [...] completely replaced the separate Austin and Morris brands.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{lowering}} {{the centre of}} gravity will always help the handling (as well as reduce the chance of roll-over). This {{can be done to}} some extent by using plastic windows (or none) and light roof, hood (bonnet) and <b>boot</b> (trunk) <b>lid</b> materials, by reducing the ground clearance, etc. Increasing the track with [...] "reversed" [...] wheels will have a similar effect, but remember that the wider the car the less spare room it has on the road and the farther you may have to swerve to miss an obstacle. Stiffer springs and/or shocks, both front and rear, will generally improve handling, at the expense of comfort on small bumps. Performance suspension kits are available. Light alloy (mostly aluminium or magnesium) wheels improve handling and ride as well as appearance.|$|R
2500|$|... 4-door {{sedan and}} station wagon Rebels from CKD (Completely Knocked Down) kits were {{assembled}} by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) in Port Melbourne, Victoria. Australian models {{were made with}} a RHD version of the 1967 Rambler Ambassador dash and two-dial instrument pack rather than the North American dash and rectangular speedo. The dash and cluster were reused for all subsequent models, including the Matador. The cars were built with right-hand drive and the body had the engine, transmission, front suspension, rear axle, and doors installed in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Other parts were boxed and shipped inside the car for final assembly in Australia. Australian models had to have aftermarket amber rear indicator lights fitted in the <b>boot</b> (trunk) <b>lid</b> to 1969 and amber lenses fitted behind the clear reverse lenses on 1970 models, as flashing red indicators were barred in Australia. Also in Australia, numerous other parts and components such as brakes, seats, carpet, lights, heaters, etc. were sourced locally to gain tariff concessions. As AMI also assembled Toyota vehicles, some parts used on the AMI Rebels were sourced from Toyota.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} was also much modified over that of earlier cars. There {{was a new}} dashboard with large speedometer and tachometer instruments in twin binnacles closer to the driver's line of sight. The instruments were mounted at a more conventional angle, avoiding the reflections caused by the upward angled flat dash of earlier cars. Conversely, auxiliary instruments were moved to angled bezels in the centre console, further from the driver's line of sight than before. The new seats introduced adjustable headrests which merged with {{the top of the}} seat when fully down. The window winder levers, the door release levers and the quarterlight vent knobs were also restyled. The remote release for the <b>boot</b> (trunk) <b>lid,</b> located {{on the inside of the}} door opening on the B-post just under the door lock striker, was moved from the right hand side of the car to the left hand side. The location of this item was always independent of whether the car was left hand drive or right hand drive.|$|R
2500|$|TRD Griffon Concept is {{a version}} of GT86 {{designed}} specifically for track driving, created by Toyota Racing Development. Changes include bonnet, roof, doors, <b>boot</b> <b>lid</b> and rear wings made from lightweight carbon fibre; carbonfibre reinforced plastic bumpers, wider front wings and rear diffuser; windows made from polycarbonate material, TRD driver's bucket seat, gear shift knob, ignition button and oil pressure and water temperature gauges; Momo steering wheel, Takata seatbelts, a TRD mechanical LSD replacing standard Torsen limited-slip differential, coil over suspension kit, final gear ratio shortened to 4.8:1, an oil cooler for the engine, a TRD mono block brake calliper kit with racing spec brake pads, TWS 18-inch wheels with Yokohama Advan tyres, stock Toyota GT86 engine. The vehicle is [...] lighter than stock Toyota GT86.|$|E
2500|$|The European-spec 2.5 V6 (2.5 6V Iniezione or 2.5QV) {{was officially}} sold only between 1985 and 1987, {{although}} {{some of them were}} not registered until 1989. Relatively few of them were sold (about 2800 units), especially when the [...] 1.8 Turbo got launched, which in some countries was cheaper in taxes because of its lower displacement. To create a bigger space between the V6 and the inline fours, the 2.5 was bored out to 2959 cc's to deliver [...] and this new engine was introduced as the 3.0 America in 1987. As its type designation suggests, the 3.0 only came in the US-specification, with the impact-bumpers and in-boot fuel tank. However, the European 'America's' were not equipped with side-markers or the door, bonnet and <b>boot</b> <b>lid</b> fortifications. Depending on the country of delivery, the 3.0 America could be equipped with a catalytic converter.|$|E
2500|$|The GP Version R {{model was}} {{produced}} in Scotia White, Passion Red or Pyrenées Black only. It featured HID headlamps; Black rear seats, with color-coded [...] "FTO" [...] monogrammed front seats - Blue/with Scotia White body color, Black/with Passion Red body color or Red/with Pyrenées Black body color; uprated suspension - 20mm front anti roll bar instead of 17mm and a 20mm rear anti roll bar rather than 18mm; limited slip differential and the redesigned rear aero spoiler. A [...] "Version R" [...] decal also features on the two spoiler side wings and on the nearside of the front lip. As this model was lightweight, items such as side skirts, front fog lights, climate control, electric folding mirrors and sound insulation were left out. The later Version R Aero and GX Sports Package Aero models feature an [...] "Aero Series" [...] decal on the offside rear of the <b>boot</b> <b>lid.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In 1968, {{concurrently}} {{with the}} replacement of the Giulia Sprint GT Veloce by the 1750 GTV, the GT 1300 Junior was revised with many of the new parts from the 1750 GTV. This included the dashboard, the suspension and the new wheel size of 5½ × 14J instead of 4½ × 15J. This revised GT 1300 Junior, however, retained the early [...] "step-front" [...] body style, which, interestingly, makes it the most mechanically refined production [...] "step-front" [...] model. Another intriguing detail is that, just as on the 1750 GTV, the remote release for the <b>boot</b> (trunk) <b>lid,</b> located {{on the inside of the}} door opening on the B-post just under the door lock striker, was moved from the right hand side of the car to the left hand side. The location of this item was always independent of whether the car was left hand drive or right hand drive. This series of GT 1300 Junior was the only model with the step-front bodyshell to have this item mounted on the left hand side. All other step-front models - Giulia Sprint GT, Giulia Sprint GT Veloce, and early GT 1300 Junior with flat dashboard - featured this item on the right hand side.|$|R
2500|$|Aluminium engine cradles and {{suspension}} struts for stretched Lincoln Town Car {{were the}} first automotive parts that were friction stir at Tower Automotive, who use the process also for the engine tunnel of the Ford GT. A spin-off of this company is called Friction Stir Link, Inc. and successfully exploits the FSW process, e.g. for the flatbed trailer [...] "Revolution" [...] of Fontaine Trailers. In Japan FSW is applied to suspension struts at Showa Denko and for joining of aluminium sheets to galvanized steel brackets for the boot (trunk) lid of the Mazda MX-5. Friction stir spot welding is successfully used for the bonnet (hood) and rear doors of the Mazda RX-8 and the <b>boot</b> <b>lid</b> of the Toyota Prius. Wheels are friction stir welded at Simmons Wheels, UT Alloy Works and Fundo. Rear seats for the Volvo V70 are friction stir welded at Sapa, HVAC pistons at Halla Climate Control and exhaust gas recirculation coolers at Pierburg. Tailor welded blanks are friction stir welded for the Audi R8 at Riftec. The B-column of the Audi R8 Spider is friction stir welded from two extrusions at Hammerer Aluminium Industries in Austria.|$|E
