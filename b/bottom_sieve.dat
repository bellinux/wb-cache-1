50|$|The Opti-Clean system {{optimize}} the strike and the throwing angles {{of each of}} the main components in CR9000 Elevation models. The grain pan is not coupled with the pre-sieve and top sieve so that each element can operate as its optimum efficiency. The cascade distance between the grain pan and the pre-sieve is increased for greater capacity, while a long sieve stroke and a steep throwing angle keep more material airborne, for even a higher cleaning efficiency. The opposing motion of the grain pan and <b>bottom</b> <b>sieve</b> to the pre-sieve reduces overall machine vibrations and increases operator comfort.|$|E
30|$|Drosophila melanogaster strains were {{separately}} collected into centrifuge tubes (50  ml), {{frozen in}} liquid nitrogen, and vigorously shaken to separate heads from bodies and extremities. Fly heads were isolated using pre-chilled size-exclusion sieves. The top sieve (Tyler equivalent 25 mesh#, 0.71  mm 2) allowed the heads to {{pass to the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>sieve</b> (Tyler equivalent 40 mesh#, 0.42  mm 2), which separated the extremities from the heads. The heads were collected and pulverized in liquid nitrogen with a pre-chilled mortar and pestle and then transferred to a micro-centrifuge tube. All samples were subjected to methanol/chloroform precipitation for protein extraction and purification according to a previously described protocol (Ericsson 1999) with slight modifications. Samples were suspended in lysis buffer consisting of 7  M urea, 2  M thiourea, and 4 % (w/v) 3 -[(3 -cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]- 1 -propanesulfonate) followed by extraction with methanol, chloroform, and double-deionized water (ddH 2 O). Prior to adding each solution, samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 14, 000  rpm for 5  min. The top aqueous layer of all samples was discarded. Subsequently, samples were washed with methanol and centrifuged again at 14, 000  rpm for 5  min. Finally, {{as much of the}} top methanol layer as possible was removed, and samples were vacuum-dried in a SpeedVac (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Lysates were homogenized by injection through a 25 -gauge needle six times, and insoluble substances were removed by centrifugation at 14, 000  rpm at 4 °C for 30  min. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} process of classification of granular materials using vibration screens is proposed by the authors. The objective of the modeling process is to describe the kinetics of extraction of granules sieved through upper and <b>bottom</b> <b>sieves.</b> The proposed model takes account of the pattern of diffusion and segregation of particles migrating through vibration screens. The model is based on the cell presentation of the process. The matrix of transition probabilities controls the particle distribution over each screen sieve. Sieved fractions are described separately, and successful sieving depends on the probability of a fraction to get through the sieve cell in the course of one sieving attempt. This probability depends on the ratio of the particle size to the sieve cell dimensions {{as well as on the}} screen oscillation parameters. The model may be used to calculate the kinetics of sieved fractions if the pre-set feed rate of particles, particles size distribution and velocity of their motion over the sieve surface are available. Предложена математическая модель процесса классификации сыпучих материалов на виброгрохотах с многоярусной компоновкой сит. Целью моделирования является описание кинетики извлечения подрешетного продукта на верхнем и нижнем сите. Модель основана на ячеечном представлении процесса. Миграция частиц каждой фракции над каждым ситом контролируется матрицей переходных вероятностей. Выход фракции под сито описан отдельно и зависит от вероятности прохождения фракции под сито в течение перехода. Модель позволяет рассчитывать кинетику выхода фракции в целевой продукт классификации...|$|R
40|$|Bottom ash {{that results}} from coal burning for {{electrical}} generation is still much underutilized in Indonesia and {{it is necessary to}} increase the usage of this waste. The manufacture of paving blocks using bottom ash, which is normally associated with high water absorption due to its high porosity and carbon content, was examined in this study with the aim to increase the usage of this waste material. The study was done in three phases: (1) the mixture of cement and <b>bottom</b> ash passing <b>sieves</b> of 2 and 5 mm were done with ratios of 1 : 3, 1 : 4, and 1 : 5; from the best proportion, fly ash was used to replace the cement material from 10 – 80 %, and (3) samples with 30 % and 50 % fly ash replacement ratios were used in combination with 5 mm and 10 mm <b>sieved</b> <b>bottom</b> ash. Compressive strength, water absorption, and abrasion resistance tests were conducted to assess the properties of the resultant paving block. From the result, bottom ash is used to replace natural sand in making paving blocks. By optimizing the particle packing density and using fly ash as a cement replacement, the compressive strength of paving blocks can exceed 40 MPa...|$|R
30|$|In laboratory, each {{plastic bag}} {{containing}} biotic sample was carefully {{opened and the}} contents were transferred on a sieve of 0.5  mm mesh. The <b>bottom</b> of the <b>sieve</b> was gently dipped several times in water stored in sink. The remaining sediment on the sieve was transferred to Petri plates, and the benthic organisms were handpicked, mostly under a stereomicroscope. Care was taken to pick up all the organisms present in the sediment sample. These organisms were put in suitable containers, and fresh formalin solution (10 %) was added. The containers were properly labeled.|$|R
25|$|The feeding {{was done}} {{through the use}} of specially-constructed small wooden boxes, 4cm by 7cm, {{developed}} by Weigl. The boxes were sealed with paraffin on the top which prevented the lice from escaping, and the underside consisted of a screen made of a fabric sieve, adopted by Weigl from sieves that were used by local peasants to separate wheat husks from the seeds. A typical box contained 400 to 800 lice larvae which would mature as the feeding took place. The <b>sieve</b> <b>bottom</b> allowed the lice to stick out their heads and feed on the human flesh. A standard feeding period took thirty to forty-five minutes, and was repeated with the same lice colony for twelve days. Usually, an individual feeder would accommodate from 7 to 11 boxes (of 400 to 800 lice each) on his or her leg, per feeding session. Typically men would place the boxes on their calves, to minimize the discomfort of the bites, while women feeders placed them on their thighs, so that the bite marks could be covered up by a skirt. A nurse had to watch over the feeding process as the lice would feed beyond the point of being gorged on the blood and could burst if left on the human flesh for too long.|$|R
30|$|The {{chemical}} composition of BC, BB and NC {{was shown in}} Table  1. The content of silica, alumina and magnesium oxide is strongly related to the sintering process and the subsequent forming of a tough ceramic matrix, when the sintering temperature has been reached [14]. The materials used presented a similar content of these chemical compounds. The silica contributes to improve the plasticity, hardness and mechanical properties of the mixtures [15] and the clay has a higher content of silica than bottom ashes. The high loss of ignition (LOI) of BB will make the specimens based on this bottom ash have a more porous internal structure. Regarding the specific density of the materials used, clay presents the greatest specific gravity, followed by BC and BB. The particle size distribution of the raw materials was shown in Fig.  1. In order to improve the homogeneity of the bottom ash/clay mixtures, the <b>bottom</b> ashes were <b>sieved</b> to remove particles larger than 2.5  mm. Particles of clay are much finer than the bottom ashes, {{as evidenced by the}} average particle size D 50 of 13.2, 234.9 and 771.2  μm of NC, BB and BC respectively. Therefore, the different particle size of the bottom ashes and clay causes a lack of homogeneity in the mixes, decreasing the structural properties of the final firing product.|$|R
