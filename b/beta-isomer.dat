40|$|Background: Levels of bone {{turnover}} markers (BTM) might {{be correlated with}} outcome in terms of skeletal-related events (SRE), disease progression, and death in patients with bladder cancer (BC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with bone metastases (BM). We try to evaluate this possible correlation in patients who receive treatment with zoledronic acid (ZOL). Methods: This observational, prospective, and multicenter study analysed BTM and clinical outcome in these patients. Serum levels of bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), procollagen type I amino-terminal propeptide (PINP), and <b>beta-isomer</b> of carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (b-CTX) were analysed. Results: Patients with RCC who died or progressed had higher baseline b-CTX levels and those who experienced SRE during follow-up showed high baseline BALP levels. In BC, a poor rate of survival was related with high baseline b-CTX and BALP levels, and new SRE with increased PINP levels. Cox univariate analysis showed that b-CTX levels were associated with higher mortality and disease progression in RCC and higher mortality in BC. Bone alkaline phosphatase was associated with increased risk of premature SRE appearance in RCC and death in BC. Conclusion: <b>Beta-isomer</b> of carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen and BALP {{can be considered a}} complementary tool for prediction of clinical outcomes in patients with BC and RCC with BM treated with ZOLNovartis Oncology Spain for supporting this stud...|$|E

40|$|Rats {{were given}} [1, 1 - 2 H 2]ethanol {{in a single}} dose, and the 2 H content was {{determined}} in testicular steroids and in organic acids of low molecular mass in the testis, liver and blood. The acids were quantified by capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry of t-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives with [2 H 4]lactate as internal standard. In addition to lactate, pyruvate, 3 -hydroxybutyrate and acids of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the testis was shown to contain 2 -hydroxybutyrate, 2 -hydroxy- 2 -methylbutyrate, 2 -hydroxyisohexanoate and glycerate. No 2 H was found in pregnenolone, 5 -androstene- 3 beta, 17 beta-diol or testosterone, whereas the abundance of monodeuterated molecules of 5 alpha-androstane- 3 alpha, 17 beta-diol and its 3 <b>beta-isomer</b> were 7. 6 % and 11. 2 % respectively. The abundance of monodeuterated lactate was 7. 0 % in the testis and 5. 3 % in the blood. The other acids were less labelled but 3 -hydroxybutyrate had a higher 2 H content in the testis (3. 1 %) than in the liver. These results support the contention that ethanol is oxidized in an alcohol dehydrogenase-catalysed reaction in testis in vivo and that the acute inhibition of the testosterone production is due at least partly to a redox effect. The labelling and increased concentration of 3 -hydroxybutyrate in the testis indicate that {{a change in the}} mitochondrial redox state might be involved...|$|E

Oxidation of the Me alpha,beta-Araf mixture with NaIO 4 preferentially oxidised the <b>beta-isomer,</b> to give pure Me alpha-Araf. Each product was progressively O-methylated using the Purdie reagent (MeI/Ag 2 O) at 25 ºC and resulting mixtures of partially methylated glycosides (PMGs) were rapidly assayed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) first to favour higher yields of mono-O-methyl derivatives and later for products with higher degrees of methylation. The products were converted to complex mixtures of partially O-methylated alditol acetate derivatives (PMAAs) by successive hydrolysis, reduction with NaBD 4, and acetylation. These {{can be used as}} gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) standards in methylation analysis of complex carbohydrates containing arabinofuranosyl and galactofuranosyl units.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{approach is}} described in which high resolution 13 C solid-state NMR (SSNMR) spectroscopy {{has been used to}} detect interactions between specific residues of membrane-embedded transport proteins and weakly binding noncovalent ligands. This procedure has provided insight into the binding site for the substrate D-glucose in the Escherichia coli sugar transport protein GalP. Cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CP-MAS) SSNMR spectra of GalP in its natural membrane at 4 degrees C indicated that the alpha- and beta-anomers of D-[1 -(13) C]glucose were bound by GalP with equal affinity and underwent fast exchange between the free and bound environments. Further experiments confirmed that by lowering the measurement temperature to - 10 degrees C, peaks could be detected selectively from the substrate when restrained within the binding site. Dipolar-assisted rotational resonance (DARR) SSNMR experiments at - 10 degrees C showed a selective interaction between the alpha-anomer of D-[1 -(13) C]glucose and 13 C-labels within [13 C]tryptophan-labeled GalP, which places the carbon atom at C- 1 in the alpha-anomer of D-glucose to within 6 A of the carbonyl carbon of one or more tryptophan residues in the protein. No interaction was detected for the <b>beta-isomer.</b> The role of tryptophan residues in substrate binding was investigated further in CP-MAS experiments to detect D-[1 -(13) C]glucose binding to the GalP mutants W 371 F and W 395 F before and after the addition of the inhibitor forskolin. The results suggest that both mutants bind D-glucose with similar affinities, but have different affinities for forskolin.

40|$|Owing to {{the limited}} {{validity}} of clinical data on the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) and bone metastases, biochemical markers are a promising tool for predicting survival, disease progression and skeletal-related events (SREs) in these patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the predictive capacity of biochemical markers of bone turnover for mortality risk, disease progression and SREs in patients with PCa and bone metastases undergoing treatment with zoledronic acid (ZA). Methods: This was an observational, prospective and multicenter study in which ninety-eight patients were included. Patients were treated with ZA (4 mg every 4 weeks for 18 months). Data were collected at baseline and 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months after the beginning of treatment. Serum levels of bone alkaline phosphtase (BALP), aminoterminal propeptide of procollagen type I (P 1 NP) and <b>beta-isomer</b> of carboxiterminal telopeptide of collagen I (b-CTX) were analysed at all points in the study. Data on disease progression, SREs development and survival were recorded. Results: Cox regression models with clinical data and bone markers showed that the levels of the three markers studied were predictive of survival time, with b-CTX being especially powerful, in which a lack of normalisation in visit 1 (3 months after the beginning of treatment) showed a 6. 3 -times more risk for death than in normalised patients. Levels of these markers were also predictive for SREs, although in this case BALP and P 1 NP proved to be better predictors. We did not find any relationship between bone markers and disease progression. Conclusion: In patients with PCa and bone metastases treated with ZA, b-CTX and P 1 NP can be considered suitable predictors for mortality risk, while BALP and P 1 NP are appropriate for SREs.

Secondly, to evaluate an association of BTM to local response, skeletal-related events (SRE), and number of metastases. Methods: In this randomized trial, 60 patients were allocated from September 2011 to March 2013 {{into one of the}} two arms: resistance training (Arm A) or passive physical therapy (Arm B) with thirty patients in each arm during RT. Biochemical markers such as pyridinoline (PYD), desoxy-pyridinoline (DPD), bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), total amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PINP), <b>beta-isomer</b> of carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I), and cross-linked N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX) were analyzed at baseline, and three months after RT. Results: Mean change values of PYD and CTX-I were significantly lower at 3  months after RT (p[*]=[*] 0. 035 and p[*]=[*] 0. 043) in Arm A. Importantly, all markers decreased in both arms, except of PYD and CTX-I in arm B, although significance was not reached for some biomarkers. In arm A, the local response was significantly higher (p[*]=[*] 0. 003) and PINP could be identified as a predictor for survivors (OR 0. 968, 95 %CI 0. 938 – 0. 999, p[*]=[*] 0. 043). BAP (OR 0. 974, 95 %CI 0. 950 – 0. 998, p[*]=[*] 0. 034) and PINP (OR 1. 025, 95 %CI 1. 001 – 1. 049, p[*]=[*] 0. 044) were related with an avoidance of SRE. Conclusions: In this group of patients with spinal bone metastases, we were able to show that patients with guided resistance training of the paravertebral muscles can influence BTM. PYD and CTX-I decreased significantly in arm A. PINP can be considered as a complementary tool for prediction of local response, and PINP as well as BAP for avoidance of SRE.

30|$|A {{variety of}} {{pesticides}} {{are being used}} in agriculture crops for the control of various insects. In spite of their agricultural benefits, pesticides are often considered {{a serious threat to}} the environment because of their persistence in environment for long period of time. Therefore the removal of pesticides from the environment source and ecological site is a topic of research interest for the scientists worldwide. In recent years, the use of degrading microorganisms or removing pesticides has been employed as the ecofriendly approach. This will enrich the in situ degradation and ex situ degradation as well. Therefore, the microbial bioresource has the great potential in solving current environmental problems. The bioremediation-based approaches possess high efficiency, sustainability, and their ecofriendly nature provides a solution to traditional physico-chemical remediation. Shrivastava et al. (2015) characterized a novel LinA type 3 δ-hexachlorocyclohexane dehydrochlorinase. The LinA gene involved the synthesis of first enzyme of the microbial degradation pathway of lindane, and leads to the dehydrochlorination of all four HCH isomers except <b>beta-isomer.</b> The two variants, LinA type 1 and LinA type 2, differ at 10 out of 156 amino acid residues. This study describes the characterization of a new variant of this enzyme, LinA type 3 gene was identified from a HCH-contaminated soil sample using metagenomic approach. Sun et al. (2015) conducted four pilot-scale test microcosms bioaugmentation study for the remediation of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)-contaminated soil. They noted the effects on degradation of HCHs and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and found that nutrients/plant bioaugmentation enhanced the degradation of 81.18 and 85.4 %, respectively). In order to develop the cleanup strategy of the polluted sites, recent study conducted by Laquitaine et al. (2016) has demonstrated the biodegradability of HCH in agricultural soils from Guadeloupe (French West Indies) and conducted studies which lead to the identification of the degrading genes among the characterized strains. The chlorinated pesticides viz. HCH, chlordecone and dieldrin, were used in agriculture until the start of 1990, this resulted in a contamination of the soil and water in the areas of banana production. They have conducted studies for lindane degradation in soil slurry microcosms. The 40 % lindane degradation efficiency was reported in 30 -day treatment experiment. During the course of this degradation study, the lindane concentration decreased from 6000 to 1330 and 800 to 340  ng/mL for the biotic and abiotic soils samples, respectively. Molecular studies for gene analysis indicating that HCH degradation was probably mediated by bacteria closely related to Sphingomonadaceae family bacteria.|$|E
40|$|This review {{investigates the}} fate and {{behaviour}} of endosulfan, a current-use organochlorine pesticide, in temperate environments and the Arctic. Usage data and patterns, physical-chemical properties, environmental partitioning and degradation, environmental levels, global distribution and temporal trends are evaluated and discussed {{in the context of}} criteria that designate a substance as a persistent organic pollutant. Endosulfan {{is one of the most}} abundant OC pesticides in the global atmosphere and is capable of undergoing long range transport to remote locations such as the Arctic. Degradation of the two isomers, alpha- and beta-endosulfan, does occur in temperate/tropical soil and aquatic systems, both by abiotic and biotic processes, although this is highly dependent on the prevailing environmental conditions. Endosulfan sulfate is the major metabolite and this recalcitrant compound has been detected in air and is present in remote mountain lake sediments, although in comparison to alpha-endosulfan, data for this compound in the wider environment are lacking. Temporal trends from ice/snow cores as well as mountain lake sediments reveal a marked increase in endosulfan accumulation from the 1980 s onwards. Furthermore, unlike other 'legacy' OC pesticides, levels of alpha-endosulfan do not show a decline in atmospheric monitoring data, reflecting ongoing use of this pesticide in the northern hemisphere. Endosulfan is present at low concentrations (relative to the pesticide, lindane) in surface Arctic Ocean waters, with the atmosphere likely to be the major contemporary source. Residues of endosulfan have been detected in marine biota for different geographical regions of the Arctic, with higher bioaccumulation factors (> 10 (3) - 10 (7)) for zooplankton and various species of fish, compared to studies in warmer/temperate systems. Endosulfan is present in marine mammals, although there is uncertainty in the various Arctic biota datasets due to differences in analytical techniques. For some biota, biomagnification factors for alpha-endosulfan are > 1, notably from fish to seal, although there is a wide variability in values between the same species for different regions of the Arctic. There is little if any evidence of trophic magnification of alpha-endosulfan in well-defined marine foodwebs, with some evidence of bio-dilution at higher trophic levels, presumably due to increased metabolism. Endosulfan does fulfil several of the criteria under the UNEP Stockholm Convention for designation as a persistent organic pollutant. The alpha- and <b>beta-isomer</b> have similar physical-chemical properties and environmental behaviour to some of the obsolete organochlorine pesticides, although an assessment of their persistence and toxicity should be viewed alongside endosulfan sulfate, as 'Sigmaendosulfan'. Persistence of 'Sigmaendosulfan' coupled to ongoing use of endosulfan pesticides, will ensure continued long-range transport and contamination of remote environments...|$|E
