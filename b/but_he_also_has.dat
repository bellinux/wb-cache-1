According to Turner, “he {{was one of the}} first names on the list. He's in a band that we all mutually respect and we felt like he was a person that understood what we were doing and could maintain a focus on what we were trying to attain. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> some interesting facets of his own musical personality that we thought would blend well with our style.” Wavering Radiant, Isis' 2009 final album, features Adam Jones, also of Tool, as a guest musician.|$|E

Justin has the stuff, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> the confidence. The odds were against him being drafted in the 11th round out of Ventura College." [...] De Fratus was the first Rio Mesa player to reach the majors during Soliz's tenure. He went on to attend Ventura College where, like at Rio Mesa, he was a starting pitcher.|$|E
500|$|In late March 2009, Jon Burlingame of Variety {{was at the}} Newman Scoring Stage at 20th century-Fox {{to listen}} and report on the {{recording}} of the score. Gregson-Williams conducted [...] "a 78-piece orchestra and a 40-voice choir (20 male, 20 female)" [...] to achieve the sound. At {{the time of his}} visit, Burlingame noted that the choir was singing [...] "stanzas from an ancient Norse poem in Old Icelandic" [...] to underscore what would be first track, [...] "Logan Through Time." [...] Director Gavin Hood commented on Gregson-Williams' style, saying: [...] "Harry's challenge is to give us operatic scale, but also keep it intimate and human. Harry's music has a kind of muscular confidence and strength that is very useful for the action, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> tremendous soul."

500|$|After its release, Closing Time was {{received}} positively by the American music press, although coverage was limited. In Rolling Stone, {{the album was}} referred to as [...] "a remarkable debut album", compared to Randy Newman, and was branded a [...] "boozier, earthier version of same and delights in rummaging through the attics of nostalgia, the persona that emerges from this remarkable debut album is Waits's own, at once sardonic, vulnerable and emotionally charged" [...] while former Village Voice editor and Pazz & Jop reviewer Robert Christgau noted that with his [...] "jazz-schooled piano and drawling delivery [...] Waits exploits an honest sentimentality which he undercuts just enough to be credible", also noting his similarity to Newman. Allmusic held the album in high regard, describing [...] "his lovelorn lyrics" [...] as being [...] "sentimental without being penetrating. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> a gift for gently rolling pop melodies" [...] and his [...] "self-conscious melancholy can be surprisingly moving." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2009, The Hollywood Reporter {{revealed}} Robert Englund {{would not}} reprise {{the role of}} Freddy Krueger for the remake; Englund had performed the role for the eight previous films. On April 3, 2009 Entertainment Weekly reported that Jackie Earle Haley was cast to take over Englund's most well-known role. Initially, the studio wanted to cast an unknown {{for the role of}} Freddy Krueger, but it was Haley's performance in Little Children that impressed Emmerich enough to cast the actor against the original intentions. Emmerich explained, [...] "Freddy is this incredible stew of malevolence and anger, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> a hint of vulnerability, and Jackie really has all of that and more. He just seemed completely right for the part." [...] Bayer stated that he and producers Form and Fuller managed to acquire the screen test Haley gave as Rorschach for Watchmen; after viewing it, Bayer said it [...] "blew [...] mind", and that he knew Haley would be able to go deep and create a believable character who was a [...] " [...] with a burned face and a claw".|$|E
500|$|A direct sequel for {{the game}} was briefly planned by Core Design. Few details were made available, but it would {{continue}} Brad's fight against the witches but his sister Jenny was considered to play a much larger role. However, it was never released (in part because of Robert Toone's departure from the company), as the new game [...] "has grown up so much during the development that it has simply became a follow up." [...] Its working title has still remained [...] "Curse of Enchantia 2", but only [...] "for practical reasons". This spiritual successor game ultimately became known as Universe. Released in 1994, the game uses an upgraded game engine of Curse of Enchantia and a similar user interface. Responding {{to some of the}} criticism of directed at Curse of Enchantia, Core Design described Universe as being [...] "a lot" [...] more logical and less linear than their first adventure game. They also described the text-based system as an improvement over the use of only icons, its benefits including allowing conversations between characters. They also acknowledged that Curse of Enchantia has [...] "suffered considerably" [...] due to inclusion of action sequences, something that [...] "adventure gamers don't want in their games." [...] The game's plot premise has remained similar to that of Curse of Enchantia, featuring a young man (the protagonist's name was changed from Brad to Boris, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> a sister named Jenny) who is transported to another world which has to save from an evil overlord. But Universe is more serious in its tone, as the game's humor only serves as comic relief and [...] "it was never intended to be as silly as Enchantia." ...|$|E

60|$|DEAR SIR:--Your {{letter to}} Mr. Lincoln of and by which you seek to obtain his {{opinions}} on certain political points, has been received by him.

The latter class beseech him to write nothing whatever upon any point of political doctrine.

6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> a real song, {{which may}} be heard in any {{assembly}} of jays and from some male birds after the congregating season is over and breeding is in progress. This singing of the jay is somewhat of a puzzle, as {{it is not the}} same song in any two places, and gives one {{the idea that there is}} no inherited and no traditional song in this species, but that each bird that has a song has invented it for himself. It varies from [...] "a sort of low song," [...] as Montagu said,--a soft chatter and warble which one can just hear at a distance of thirty or forty yards,--to a song composed of several musical notes harmoniously arranged, {{which may be}} heard distinctly a quarter of a mile away. This set and far-reaching song is rare, but some birds have a single very powerful and musical note, or short phrase, which they repeat at regular intervals by way of song. If by following up the sound one can get near enough to the tree where the meeting is being held to see what is going on, it is most interesting to watch the vocalist, who is like a leader, and who, perched quietly, continues to repeat that one powerful, unchanging, measured sound in the midst of a continuous concert of more or less musical sounds from the other birds.|$|E

6000|$|The great {{difficulty}} with the English lies {{in the absence of}} something one may call democratic imagination. We find it easy to realise an individual, but very hard to realise that the great masses consist of individuals. Our system has been aristocratic: in the special sense of there being only a few actors on the stage. And the back scene is kept quite dark, though it is really a throng of faces. Home Rule tended to be not so much the Irish as the Grand Old Man. The Boer War tended not to be so much South Africa as simply [...] "Joe." [...] And it is the amusing but distressing fact that every class of political leadership, as it comes to the front in its turn, catches the rays of this isolating lime-light; and becomes a small aristocracy. Certainly no one has the aristocratic complaint so badly as the Labour Party. At the recent Congress, the real difference between Larkin and the English Labour leaders was not so much in anything right or wrong in what he said, as in something elemental and even mystical in the way he suggested a mob. But it must be plain, even to those who agree with the more official policy, that for Mr. Havelock Wilson the principal question was Mr. Havelock Wilson; and that Mr. Sexton was mainly considering the dignity and fine feelings of Mr. Sexton. You may say they were as sensitive as aristocrats, or as sulky as babies; {{the point is that the}} feeling was personal. But Larkin, like Danton, not only talks like ten thousand men talking, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> some of the carelessness of the colossus of Arcis; [...] "Que mon nom soit fletri, que la France soit libre." ...|$|E
60|$|But Rowan {{was a man}} more {{thoughtful}} than Cornbury, and was specially thoughtful as to his own position. He was a radical at heart {{if ever there was}} a radical. But in saying this I must beg my reader to understand that a radical is not necessarily a revolutionist or even a republican. He does not, by reason of his social or political radicalism, desire the ruin of thrones, the degradation of nobles, the spoliation of the rich, or even the downfall of the bench of bishops. Many a young man is frightened away from the just conclusions of his mind and the strong convictions of his heart by dread of being classed with those who are jealous of the favoured ones of fortune. A radical may be as ready as any aristocrat to support the crown with his blood, and the church with his faith. It is in this that he is a radical; that he desires, expects, works for, and believes in, the gradual progress of the people. No doctrine of equality is his. Liberty he must have, and such position, high or low, for himself and others, as each man's individual merits will achieve for him. The doctrine of outward equality he eschews as a barrier to all ambition, and to all improvement. The idea is as mean as the thing is impracticable. But within,--is it in his soul or in his heart?--within his breast there is a manhood that will own no inferiority to the manhood of another. He retires to a corner that an earl with his suite may pass proudly through the doorway, and he grudges the earl nothing of his pride. It is the earl's right. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> his right; and neither queen, nor earl, nor people shall invade it. That is the creed of a radical.|$|E

In January 1994, he died in a mysterious helicopter crash, which was widely blamed on Dostum. His death came at a time when Junbish's Tajik commanders fiercely opposed Dostum's decision to ally with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezbi Islami against Massoud. Following Momim's death, most of his forces joined Junbish, but some of those stationed in Kabul joined Jamiat-e Islami.|$|R
