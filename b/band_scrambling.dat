25|$|Fifth Dimension {{can also}} be seen as a {{testament}} to the rapidity with which pop music was evolving during the mid-1960s. Like its predecessor, Turn! Turn! Turn!, the album was made under trying circumstances, with the <b>band</b> <b>scrambling</b> to compensate for the loss of their main songwriter in the wake of Clark's departure. This resulted in an uneven album that included a total of four cover versions and an instrumental. However, Fifth Dimension actually contained fewer covers than either of their Clark-era albums, as well as an absence of songs by Bob Dylan, whose material, along with Clark's, had dominated earlier Byrds releases.|$|E

50|$|The University of Chicago Band is a pep {{band and}} a marching <b>band</b> (of the <b>scramble</b> <b>band</b> variety) for the University of Chicago. The Band {{was founded in}} 1898, {{five years after the}} {{university}} opened.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Scramble</b> <b>bands</b> {{often take}} pride in their {{diversion}} from the normal marching band. In fact, most <b>scramble</b> <b>bands</b> do not march at all, regardless of whether their official group name contains a form of the word [...] "March".|$|R
50|$|During the fall, {{the band}} attends all home {{football}} games and usually {{two to three}} of the away games. For the pre-game and halftime of each game, the band writes a script, intended to be humorous, which is read over the loudspeaker as the <b>band</b> <b>scrambles</b> into a formation which relates to the jokes in the script. During the football game, the band plays during offensive first downs and after any points are scored, and supplies various chants and songs.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Scramble</b> <b>bands</b> {{are notorious}} for their irreverent stunts, {{and some of these}} prove to be controversial. The most {{upsetting}} events usually have consequences (see also: censorship) regardless of whether the band intended such controversy. Listed below are some of the more notable events in <b>scramble</b> <b>band</b> lore: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{band was}} formed in 1919. By 1930 the band had become a <b>scramble</b> <b>band,</b> a method that was also adopted by most other Ivy League marching bands (as well as the Stanford Band and the Rice Marching Owl Band), with the {{exception}} of the Cornell University band. While the inventor of the <b>scramble</b> <b>band</b> technique remains in debate, the HUB maintains a strong claim to the title. A <b>scramble</b> <b>band</b> simply runs (in lieu of marching) from one formation to the next on a cue, typically a starter's pistol.|$|R
5000|$|Like their marching counterparts, <b>scramble</b> <b>bands</b> {{almost always}} perform music using {{traditional}} band instruments. They will also stand in formations on a field, {{but that is}} usually where the similarity between <b>scramble</b> <b>bands</b> and typical marching bands end. The formations themselves are often simple shapes or crude [...] "pictures" [...] that lend themselves to a particular section of the performance instead of intricate geometric or abstract shapes. Additionally, <b>scramble</b> <b>band</b> performances often rely on a humorous or satirical script, read during the performance by an announcer using a loudspeaker or public address system.|$|R
50|$|The William & Mary Pep <b>Band</b> is the <b>scramble</b> <b>band</b> of the College of William and Mary. It is a student-run {{ensemble}} that performs at home {{football games}} in the fall sports season and basketball {{games in the}} winter sports season. Membership is open to anyone currently enrolled at the college.|$|R
2500|$|The 1950s {{witnessed}} an era {{of great}} transition for the band. [...] Gradually, the band changed from a corps-style <b>band</b> to today's <b>scramble</b> <b>band.</b> [...] Some alumni recall seeing the <b>band</b> <b>scramble</b> without spoken accompaniment as early as 1938, and records of scrambling exist as early as 1941. In 1955, the band began experimenting with comedic scripts {{to go along with}} the half-time scrambles. [...] The first script on record was in a home opener against Rutgers University in 1955, by which time scrambling was a well-established feature of field performances. [...] However, the band didn't entirely stop marching until the 1970s. [...] In 1952, the band switched from black to orange-and-black plaid blazers and continued to wear the straw hats that had been introduced a year or two earlier. [...] With this change, the band started the tradition of wearing colorful formal wear on the field — something that has since been emulated by every Ivy League band at one point or another, as well as those of Stanford, Virginia, Rutgers, and Rice. The trendsetting new uniform was even featured on the cover of the October 1955 issue of Sports Illustrated.|$|R

2500|$|The Villanova Band is {{the largest}} and oldest musical group at Villanova with over 372 members. The Villanova Band has five divisions: the Concert <b>Band,</b> the <b>Scramble</b> <b>Band,</b> the Pep Band, the Jazz Ensemble, and the Villanova Orchestra. The Concert Band plays one concert {{at the end of}} each semester. It also {{performs}} throughout the Villanova community and on its annual [...] "Fall Tour." [...] The <b>Scramble</b> <b>Band</b> performs for Villanova Football games between plays and at halftime on the field. The Villanova Pep Band performs at Villanova Men's and Women's Basketball games, including post-season games such as the Big East Tournament. The Jazz Ensemble and Orchestra has end-of-semester concerts and performs around the Philadelphia area several times a year. The band is made up of students of every school within Villanova.|$|R
50|$|By the 1970s, {{along with}} most of the other Ivy League bands, the Penn <b>Band</b> became a <b>scramble</b> <b>band.</b> However, it had begun moving away from the {{traditional}} corps style in the 1940s. Its current uniform, however, is an inadvertent nod to the past—it is a near-exact copy of the uniform worn by the freshman band in the early 1930s.|$|R
2500|$|The Band won ESPN's Battle of the Marching Bands in 1996, {{beating the}} Stanford <b>Band,</b> another <b>scramble</b> <b>band,</b> {{in the final}} round. [...] The other {{competitors}} in this online poll were: Rice, Wisconsin, Ohio State, Grambling, Michigan, Stanford, and Texas A [...] It is suspected, though unconfirmed, that the Band won partly due to very strong voting in their favor by bands previously eliminated {{who did not want}} any of their rival bands to win. [...] None of Princeton's rival bands were in the competition, therefore the PUB was something of a neutral choice.|$|R
50|$|The Columbia University Marching Band (CUMB) has {{performed}} for Columbia University since 1904. It {{claims to be}} the first college or university marching band in the United States to convert to a <b>scramble</b> <b>band</b> format, making the switch in the 1950s. Today, all of the Ivy League bands (except Cornell), as well as the Stanford Band and William & Mary Pep Band, have adopted the <b>scramble</b> <b>band</b> style.|$|R
5000|$|Following the lukewarm-to-decent {{reception}} to Jugulator, the <b>band</b> <b>scrambled</b> {{to assess}} what exactly went wrong, and determined that fans preferred a sound more faithful to Priest's back catalog. The resulting album would be an amalgam of Jugulator-style riffs, references to '80s Priest, and sporadic nu-metal additions such as samples, and industrial-style beats. While the ostensible aim was to offer something for every possible fan, in the end, the album received a much poorer reception than Jugulator by most fans -- and {{would result in the}} eventual reunion of the [...] "classic" [...] line-up with Halford. Owens has stated that Demolition was his favorite album that he did with the group, claiming it had [...] "better vocals and more melody" [...] than Jugulator.|$|R
50|$|<b>Scramble</b> <b>bands</b> are {{generally}} student-run {{and tend to}} be smaller in membership than what one would expect from a marching band.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>scramble</b> <b>band</b> - {{also known}} as a scatter band - is a {{particular}} type of field-performing marching band with distinct characteristics that set it apart from other common forms of marching bands; most notably, <b>scramble</b> <b>bands</b> do not normally march. In fact, the name comes from {{the way in which the}} band moves between formations [...] - [...] members run to each form without using a predescribed path; this is known as scrambling or, in the western half of the United States, scattering.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps {{the turtle}} was angry, for it ran on shore with {{remarkable}} swiftness, uttering a shrill cry as it advanced. At {{once all the}} other turtles awoke to life and with upraised heads joined their comrade in the rush for the seals. Most of Chief Muffruff's <b>band</b> <b>scrambled</b> hastily down the rocks and plunged into {{the water of the}} sea without waiting for the turtles to reach them; but the chief himself was slow in escaping. It may be that he was ashamed to run while the mermaids were watching, but if this was so he made a great mistake. The turtles snapped at his fins and tail and began biting round chunks out of them so that Chief Muffruff screamed with pain and anger and floundered into the water {{as fast as he could}} go. The vengeful turtles were certainly the victors, and now held undisputed possession of the island.|$|R
5000|$|The Huskies Pep <b>Band</b> is a <b>scramble</b> <b>band</b> from Michigan Technological University in Houghton, Michigan. They bill {{themselves}} as [...] "Living Proof of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, The Cream of the Keweenaw, The Pride of Pastyland, The Second Best Feeling in the World." [...] They {{are known for}} their often irreverent cheers and taunts as well as their unique uniforms consisting of black-and-gold striped bib overalls (known simply as [...] "Stripes") and creative hats unique to each band member. The Huskies Pep Band performs at all home football, basketball, volleyball, and ice hockey games, as well as parades and other local events.|$|R
25|$|Members {{may also}} group into squads, ranks, sections, or (especially with <b>scramble</b> <b>bands</b> that {{primarily}} form words) letters. Instead of each member having an individual move, moves are then learned on a squad-by-squad (rank-by-rank) basis.|$|R
50|$|The Goin' Band {{makes use}} of both traditional-style marching (formations moving {{goal-line}} to goal-line) and corps-style (formations while playing to the sidelines) in its performances. The Goin' Band also incorporates some of the tactics of <b>scramble</b> <b>bands.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{before the}} band's {{scheduled}} headlining tour in December 2012, brothers Michael and Tommy Dalhover abruptly left the band, which forced the <b>band</b> to <b>scramble</b> to recruit new members. Without {{enough time to}} do so, the band was forced to cancel the tour but quickly added Cody Patton and Josh Wells to play drums and guitar, respectively. Both Patton and Wells played their first show with Sea of Treachery in March 2013.|$|R
50|$|The University of Pennsylvania Band (commonly {{known as}} the Penn Band, or its vaudeville-esque {{performance}} name The Huge, the Enormous, the Well-Endowed, Undefeated, Ivy-League Champion, University of Pennsylvania Oxymoronic Fighting Quaker Marching Band) {{is among the most}} active collegiate band programs in the U.S. The organization {{is a part of the}} Department of Athletics at the University of Pennsylvania. Like most of the other 50 performing arts groups on the Penn Campus, it has no affiliation with any academic department and is sponsored by the Vice Provost's Office for Undergraduate Life. Typically ranging between 80 and 100 members every year, it is among the largest and most active student-run organizations on campus, performing upwards of 60 times during the academic year. Like most of the Ivy League Bands, the Penn <b>Band</b> is a <b>scramble</b> <b>band.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Princeton University Band {{serves as}} the marching band and pep band of Princeton University. Like most other Ivy League bands, it is a <b>scramble</b> <b>band.</b> To members and fans, it is often known as the PUB (pronounced Pea You Bee) or simply The Band. Many alumni {{refer to it as}} the Tiger Band.|$|R
25|$|<b>Scramble</b> <b>bands</b> (also {{referred}} to as 'Scatter' bands) are a variation on show bands. They generally do not march {{in time with the}} music, but, as their name implies, scramble from design to design and often incorporate comedic elements into their performances. Most of the bands in the Ivy League use this style, excepting only Cornell University.|$|R
5000|$|More {{concerned}} with outrageous halftime shows than marching patterns and musicianship, the CUMB {{has a reputation}} for edgy humor, and is often thought to be the most controversial and irreverent of the <b>scramble</b> <b>bands.</b> Since the 1960s, national news outlets have covered the band's most infamous pranks. CUMB bills itself as [...] "The Cleverest Band in the World." ...|$|R
50|$|The skyline route runs {{clockwise}} {{around an}} amphitheatre curving around {{the valley of}} Moolmanshoek. Starting at 1750m, the first high peak is 'The Pyramid' at 2167m. There are some sections of fairly flat terrain along the high ridges. Grassy tussocks form {{a large part of}} the landscape, broken by rock <b>bands</b> and steep <b>scrambles</b> to reach the saddles and high points.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, {{the marching}} band took a much {{different}} and nontraditional approach to its field shows as it experimented with becoming a <b>scramble</b> <b>band,</b> much like those found at Stanford University and all but one Ivy League institution. However, the band quickly reverted to a traditional corps-style marching band in 1977. The band continues to grow steadily and size and gain recognition throughout the Atlantic Coast Conference.|$|R
