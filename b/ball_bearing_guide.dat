40|$|A {{parachute}} {{swivel mechanism}} (PSM) for planetary entry missions {{such as a}} Mars probe (MARSNET) or return of cometary material samples (ROSETTA mission) has been developed. The purpose of the PSM is to decouple the spin of the probe from the parachute, with low friction torque, during both the deployment and descent phases. Critical requirements are high shock loads, low friction, low temperatures, and several years of storage in the deep space environment (during the cruise phase of the probe, prior to operation). The design uses a main thrust <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> {{to cope with the}} load requirement and a smaller thrust <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> for <b>guiding</b> of the shaft. Except for use on the Viking and Galileo swivels, it appears that this type of bearing has very rarely been employed in space mechanisms, so that little is known of its friction behavior with dry lubrication. A slip ring assembly allows the transfer of electrical power for post-reefing of the parachute. A test program has been conducted covering the environmental conditions of Mars entry and Earth reentry. This paper describes requirement constraints, model missions of planetary entries, a bearing trade-off, analyses performed, design details, the lubrication system, and test results (friction torque versus load/spin rate). In addition, the design of the test rig is addressed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{find the}} {{possible}} error sources of manufacturing systems, the important operational characteristics of different body elements should be investigated. Stiffness {{is one of}} the most important characteristics of a machine tool's guiding system, influencing their performance and accuracy.

Then, we have carried out some experiments to investigate the static stiffness of industrial <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> linear motion <b>guides</b> in normal, lateral and angular directions. A maximum force of 10 kN has been applied to measure it for three preload levels of carriages and in compression and tensile directions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{main goal}} of this {{research}} work is to investigate and characterise the geometric accuracy {{and its effect on}} the performance of the guiding system in machine tools or CMMs. As geometric errors are one of the main sources of the volumetric errors in manufacturing systems, it is necessary to carry out a comprehensive geometric measurement of their components such as guiding systems. Lack of care during assembly can cause some kinds of errors in the guides and other components which may lead to over-determination of the system. In this research, some pre-defined geometric deviations in horizontal, vertical and both directions are applied to the guides and their corresponding influences on the accuracy are recorded. Straightness measurements in horizontal and vertical planes, and also roll, pitch and yaw angular measurements are carried out as a function of axis position. The motion errors of a typical <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> linear <b>guide</b> with a slide mounted on four carriages are analyzed. Except for the roll angular measurements which are conducted using electronic levels, all the other ones have been carried out employing laser interferometry method. Various locations of the slide are measured to find out the role of position for straightness and angular measurements. FEM simulations have been then used to model the experiments. Good agreements between the experimental and numerical results are observed. The location of the work-piece on the slide also has an important role for various motion errors...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 39 In {{view of the}} inflammability of LNG (liquefied natural gas), {{submerged}} type {{pumps are}} normally used to protect against leaks. The overhaul interval of an LNG pump, therefore, {{is subject to the}} life of its <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> because LNG is an extremely low temperature, low viscosity and low boiling point liquid. The use of LNG to fulfill the extremely demanding functions of lubrication and cooling of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> results in substantial reduction in the bearings? maximum load tolerance. The limits inherent in the <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> consequently, will make it difficult to extend the life of the bearings beyond that currently achieved, if the bearing system itself depends on the use of conventional <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> Since the service life of a <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> is not necessarily constant, there is a possibility of sudden break-down. Thus, new LNG pumps were developed using a form of bearing for which service lifetime is not primary importance, though it nevertheless has a long service life and high reliability, and is small and light. Details are given later. Two types of the static bearings were developed: a hydrostatic slide bearing and a hydrostatic <b>guide</b> <b>bearing,</b> incorporating a hydrostatic journal <b>bearing</b> surrounding the <b>ball</b> <b>bearing.</b> The hydrostatic slide bearing supports the shaft by virtue of the film pressure of the LNG discharged from the pump itself. Therefore, the shaft with <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> in the usual way, the buffer effect of LNG in the hydrostatic guide section substantially reduces the radial load of the <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> A hydrostatic journal bearing does not bear any of the thrust load. A structure has, therefore, been developed in which a disk-piston-type thrust balancing system can be used to enable self-balancing of the shaft thrust load, thereby reducing the thrust load to zero. The downstream side of the disk piston is designed to allow a variable clearance whereby, when it is at its maximum, the total flow area upward thrust force exceeds the downward thrust force. In this way, the two thrust forces always balance each other automatically. A high lift impeller was designed, the number of operational stages was reduced, and, radial diffusers were used to enable the use of shorter shafts. For the stage housing, a piston ring type sealing is used, a single layer cylinder casing method was developed that enables a multistep seal provided by the piston rings at each stage. This allowed the pump diameter to be reduced. The use of hydrostatic slide <b>bearings</b> (hydrostatic <b>guide</b> <b>bearings),</b> a thrust balancing mechanism, and the reduction of shaft length has enabled substantial extension to be made to the overhaul interval of pump. Pumps with hydrostatic slide bearings: 100, 000 hours or more. Pumps with hydrostatic guide bearings: 50, 000 hours or more. The use of hydrostatic slide bearings results in some reduction in the shaft bearing performance, due to wear of the face of the bearing. Measurement of the amount of wear, however, enables the remaining life of the bearing to be predicted, and this in turn facilitates cost reductions in terms of the failure diagnosis system employed. Furthermore, since there is little likelihood of sudden failure, maintenance schedules can be organized in a systematic way. The use of high lift impeller and single wall cylindrical radial diffuser has enabled the production of a compact, lighter pump unit, which is easy to disassemble and reassemble. This technology is applicable to pumps for other liquefied gas, for example, LPG, LEG (liquefied ethylene gas), etc...|$|R
