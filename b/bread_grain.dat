25|$|Other {{reforms were}} of a more {{imitative}} nature. The reason for the lightning advance of the French army was its great superiority in numbers. An army of 125,000 French faced a Dutch field army of only 22,000. The difference in the total strengths of the two armies was not as large, as the Dutch had managed to double {{the size of the}} States Army from its peace-time strength of about 35,000 to about 80,000 in early 1672 through frantic recruitment efforts. Most of these additional troops garrisoned the many Dutch fortresses, however, which subsequently often surrendered without a fight to the French, or were simply bypassed. In any case, 22,000 was about the maximum the Dutch could support logistically in the field. The reason why the French were able to support a far larger field army was that they had developed a superior logistical system in the recent War of Devolution. Previous armies of large size, like the combined Franco-Dutch army of 50,000 that invaded the Spanish Netherlands in 1635 and subsequently almost starved, simply could not manage the strain of supplying the daily bread of the soldiers. The French Secretary of State for War Louvois had developed a system of forward supply bases, well-stocked with fodder for the horses and <b>bread</b> <b>grain</b> for the soldiers {{before the start of the}} annual campaign season.

Considerable epidemiological {{research indicates that}} whole grain foods are associated with lower risk of chronic diseases. However, Americans consume far below the recommended 3 daily servings of whole grains. Little {{research has focused on}} factors that influence consumption of specific foods, such as whole <b>grain</b> <b>bread.</b> Examining sensory and behavioral factors through the theory of planned behavior may provide a comprehensive explanation for liking and consumption of whole <b>grain</b> <b>breads.</b> In Phase 1, using descriptive analysis, a lexicon was developed to describe the sensory attributes of 12 commercial 100 % whole <b>grain</b> <b>breads.</b> Five breads were representative of the range of breads analyzed, and selected for use in the subsequent bread liking study. Phase 2, part 1 included development and testing of a questionnaire associated with whole <b>grain</b> <b>bread</b> consumption. Next the theory-based questionnaire was used to determine factors that influence whole <b>grain</b> <b>bread</b> consumption among 270 bread consumers recruited at a local grocery store. The mean daily whole <b>grain</b> <b>bread</b> intake was 1. 3 servings. Liking, whole grain versus refined <b>grain</b> <b>bread</b> preference, and usual whole <b>grain</b> <b>bread</b> consumption pattern were significant predictors of intention to consume whole <b>grain</b> <b>bread</b> and significantly increased the variance explained by the model compared to the standard model. Intention, whole grain versus refined <b>grain</b> <b>bread</b> preference, and usual whole <b>grain</b> <b>bread</b> consumption pattern were significant predictors of whole <b>grain</b> <b>bread</b> intake and significantly increased the variance explained by the model. During Phase 3 differences in liking ratings were examined among five commercial whole <b>grain</b> <b>breads</b> and if liking ratings were influenced by different consumer groups (whole grain versus refined <b>grain</b> <b>bread</b> preference, type of bread bag returned and propylthiouracil taster groups). Results showed that Cub Foods and Country Hearth breads were most liked and Natural Ovens bread was least liked. Consumer characteristics had no effect on liking ratings. When comparing descriptive analysis sensory attributes and liking ratings, several sensory attributes had a significant effect on bread liking ratings.

40|$|The {{current study}} aimed to {{investigate}} incidence, prevalence and regional distribution of sarcoidosis in Switzerland {{with respect to}} environmental exposures. All sarcoidosis patients hospitalised between 2002 and 2005 were identified from the Swiss hospital statistics from the Swiss Federal Office for Statistics (Neuchatel, Switzerland). Regional exposure characteristics included the regional distribution of different industrial sectors, agriculture and air quality. Co-inertia analysis, {{as well as a}} generalised linear model, was applied. The prevalence of 'ever-in-life' diagnosed sarcoidosis, currently active sarcoidosis and sarcoidosis requiring hospitalisation was 121 (95 % CI 93 - 149), 44 (95 % CI 34 - 54) and 16 (95 % CI 10 - 22) per 100, 000 inhabitants, respectively. The mean annual incidence of sarcoidosis was 7 (95 % CI 5 - 11) per 100, 000 inhabitants.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I improve Gardner's surplus {{transformation}} curve framework by assuming {{that government is}} able to vary many policy instruments simultaneously instead of only one. I use my framework to find {{the combination of the}} currently used instruments which provides the most efficient income redistribution for the Austrian <b>bread</b> <b>grains</b> market. Contrasting the most efficient policy to the actual policy reveals that 464 million Austrian shillings were wasted. I theoretically compare for a small country the transfer efficiency of every possible pair of the four major agricultural policy instruments: floor price, production quota, coresponsibility levy, and deficiency payments. Without considering the marginal cost of public funds (MCF), deficiency payments cum quota (equal to a fully-decoupled direct income support) is the most efficient policy, succeeded by floor price cum quota, and floor price cum deficiency payments. If the MCF is taken into account, the ranking crucially depends on the market parameters, the transfer level, and the value of the MCF. For the Austrian <b>bread</b> <b>grains</b> market, I empirically demonstrate, that given the present support level, a fully-decoupled direct income support redistributes income most efficiently as long as the MCF is lower than 1. 17. Beyond this value a floor price cum quota policy becomes more efficient. A floor price cum deficiency payments policy is never superior to the floor price cum quota. 2 1...|$|R
