40|$|Abstract-l) Megalobfatta blaberoides nymphs stridulate in {{response}} to disturbance. Sounds arc pro-duced by rubbing a pair of bilateral ventral files on the sixth sternum across opposing stationary scrapers located laterodorsally on the fifth sternum. The forward-moving file {{on one side and}} the backward-moving contralateral file generate sound simultaneously. (2) Intact nymphs produce a broad frequency band noise (5 - 35 kHz). Due to superposition of signals and silent pauses produced by the bilateral organs, no regular pattern of amplitude modulation is measurable. The sound produced by unilaterally muted nymphs contains regular pulse-train groups (forward and <b>back</b> <b>cycle)</b> each of which is divided into a short forward motion and a longer backward motion. These are interrupted by a short pause. A longer pause occurs prior to the anteriorly directed motion of the intact file. (3) Megaloblatta’s proteinaceous tergal secretion is chemically and physically similar to that of Blatta orientalis. Coupling of acoustic warning, bright colour patterns, and chemical defence constitutes a multi-modal aposematic display which may be effective both nocturnally and diurnally against potential predators...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 The sum {{of costs}} and {{benefits}} in an interspecific interaction determines whether the relationship is mutualistic, neutral, or antagonistic. We investigate novel benefits Acacia constricta may gain from ant visitors and how A. constricta may minimize potential costs of ant visitation. A. constricta attracts ants onto its foliage and encourages nesting at its base with extrafloral nectaries. Plants with basal nests have significantly greater soil nutrients and produce twice as many seeds as plants lacking basal nests (Wagner 1997). Along side these benefits, however, ants can interfere with plant reproduction. This study tests whether augmented soil nutrients increase A. constricta's defenses and ant attractants. We further test mechanisms A. constricta may have to reduce the potential costs of ants to reproduction. We found that increased soil nutrients elevated defense mechanisms in A. constricta and increased extrafloral nectary number, suggesting ants that provide plants with nutrients may indirectly increase plant defense as well as participate in a feed <b>back</b> <b>cycle</b> where ants increase soil nutrients allowing plants to increase ant attractants. In addition, plants {{have at least two}} mechanisms to keeps ants separated from flowers, minimizing ant costs to reproduction...|$|E
40|$|Culture supernatants from monolayers {{prepared}} with guinea-pig peritoneal macrophages {{were found to}} contain functional D and C 3 activity. Factor D was detected by consumption of C 3 {{in the presence of}} culture supernatant, factor B and insoluble C 3 b. Preincubation of culture supernatant with anti-D IgG totally inhibited C 3 consumption in the D assay which identified factor D as the B activating enzyme. The synthesis of D and C 3 by macrophages was proven by the fact that cycloheximide in the culture medium strongly reduced the amount of detectable D and C 3 and also incorporation experiments with 14 C-labelled aminoacids resulted in the production by macrophages of radio-labelled D and C 3. In addition radiolabelled B and P were also detected. The majority of the B protein appeared in its cleaved (Bb) form and, therefore, factor B escaped detection in the functional assay. For unknown reasons functional activity of P was not detectable. The enzyme responsible for B cleavage in the culture supernatants was identified as factor D. Activation of B by the D enzyme in culture supernatants probably occurred through the C 3 b-dependent feed <b>back</b> <b>cycle</b> of the alternative pathway. This is concluded from our observation that C 3 was consumed on incubation of the culture supernatant at 37 °, although at a low rate...|$|E
