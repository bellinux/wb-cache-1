5|$|It was {{discovered}} in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Enrico Fermi, {{one of the pioneers}} of nuclear physics.

5|$|Mendelevium was {{discovered}} by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles in 1955, the same method still used to produce it today. It was named after Dmitri Mendeleev, father of the periodic table of the chemical elements. Using available microgram quantities of the isotope einsteinium-253, over a million mendelevium atoms may be produced each hour. The chemistry of mendelevium is typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced mendelevium {{and all of its}} isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside <b>basic</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>research.</b>|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium was {{discovered}} {{as a component}} of the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Albert Einstein. Its most common isotope einsteinium-253 (half-life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of californium-253 in a few dedicated high-power nuclear reactors with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside <b>basic</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>research.</b> In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element mendelevium in 1955.|$|E

At the same time there is an insufficiency or even minuteness publications with doctrinal and theoretical nature referring to the general and fundamental issues of financial law of the EU.

2500|$|Science and {{technology}} research is often funded through a competitive {{process in which}} potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding.

In the OECD, around two-thirds {{of research and development}} in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by universities and government.
