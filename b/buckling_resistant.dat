40|$|Progress in the {{development}} of verified design technology for generic advanced-composite structural components loaded in compression is reported. Generic structural configurations material systems and load ranges of interest for a given application were investigated using structural procedures, structural analysis procedures, and laboratory testing of structural specimens. Both flat and curved composite compression panels that are designed either to be <b>buckling</b> <b>resistant</b> or to have postbuckling strength depending on the expected application of the panels were considered...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} to <b>buckling</b> <b>resistant</b> design of general grid stiffened flat plates based on smeared stiffener theory for combined inplane loading is discussed. Some results from parametric studies performed {{to assess the}} validity of smeared stiffener for practical stiffener configurations and to illustrate the benefits of different stiffening concepts are given.

40|$|A final program summary is {{reported}} for test and evaluation activities that were conducted for space shuttle web selection. Large scale advanced composite shear web components were tested and analyzed to evaluate application of advanced composite shear web construction to {{a space shuttle}} orbiter thrust structure. The shear web design concept consisted of a titanium-clad + or - 45 deg boron/epoxy web laminate stiffened with vertical boron-epoxy reinforced aluminum stiffeners and logitudinal aluminum stiffening. The design concept was evaluated to be efficient and practical for the application that was studied. Because {{of the effects of}} buckling deflections, a requirement is identified for shear <b>buckling</b> <b>resistant</b> design to maximize the efficiency of highly-loaded advanced composite shear webs...|$|E

Its powers include flight, pink lasers from each shoulder, pectoral missiles, yellow sonic rings from the mouth, missiles in the belt <b>buckle,</b> blade <b>resistant</b> armor, a launchable blade on each shoulder, sharp claws, four restrainers on each hip, and {{an electric drill}} in the belt buckle.|$|R
40|$|Crown panel {{design studies}} showing the {{relationship}} between panel size, cost, weight, and aircraft configuration are compared to aluminum design configurations. The effects of a stiffened sandwich design concept are also discussed. This paper summarizes {{the effect of a}} design cost model in assessing the cost and weight relationships for fuselage crown panel designs. Studies were performed using data from existing aircraft to assess the effects of different design variables on the cost and weight of transport fuselage crown panel design. Results show a strong influence of load levels, panel size, and material choices on the cost and weight of specific designs. A design tool being developed under the NASA ACT program is used in the study to assess these issues. The effects of panel configuration comparing postbuckled and <b>buckle</b> <b>resistant</b> stiffened laminated structure is compared to a stiffened sandwich concept. Results suggest some potential economy with stiffened sandwich designs for compression dominated structure with relatively high load levels...|$|R
40|$|Further {{studies to}} {{determine}} the potential for using a curvilinear fiber format {{in the design of}} composite laminates are reported. The curvilinear format is in contrast to the current practice of having the fibers aligned parallel to each other and in a straight line. The problem of a plate with a central circular hole is used as a candidate problem for this study. The study concludes that for inplane tensile loading the curvilinear format is superior. The limited results to date on compression buckling loads indicate that the curvilinear designs are poorer in <b>resistant</b> <b>buckling.</b> However, for the curvilinear design of interest, the reduction in buckling load is minimal and so overall there is a gain in considering the curvilinear design...|$|R
40|$|Development of an {{algorithm}} {{to perform}} the optimal sizing of <b>buckling</b> <b>resistant,</b> imperfect, anisotropic ring-stiffened cylinders subjected to axial compression, torsion, and internal pressure is presented. The enforcement of stability constraints is treated {{in a way that}} does not require any eigenvalue analysis. Assumption of criticality of these stability constraints during the optimal sizing of the cylinders produced designs that nevertheless satisfied all of the stress constraints as well as the stability constraints. Case studies performed using a combination of penalty function and feasible direction optimization methods indicate that the presence of the axisymmetric initial imperfection in the cylinder wall can significantly affect the optimal designs. Weight savings associated with the addition of two rings to the unstiffened cylinder and/or the addition of internal pressure is substantial when torsion makes up a significant fraction of the combined load state...|$|E
40|$|Three {{large scale}} {{advanced}} composite shear web components were tested and analyzed to evaluate {{application of the}} design concept to a space shuttle orbiter thrust structure. The shear web design concept consisted of a titanium-clad + or - 45 deg boron/epoxy web laminate stiffened with vertical boron/epoxy reinforced aluminum stiffeners. The design concept was evaluated to be efficient and practical for the application that was studied. Because {{of the effects of}} buckling deflections, a requirement is identified for shear <b>buckling</b> <b>resistant</b> design to maximize the efficiency of highly-loaded advanced composite shear webs. An approximate analysis of prebuckling deflections is presented and computer-aided design results, which consider prebuckling deformations, indicate that the design concept offers a theoretical weight saving of 31 percent relative to all metal construction. Recommendations are made for design concept options and analytical methods that are appropriate for production hardware...|$|E

40|$|Stiffened {{panels are}} widely used in {{aircraft}} structures such as wing covers, fuselages, control surfaces, spar webs, bulkheads, and floors. The detailed sizing of minimum-weight stiffened panels involves many considerations. Use of composite materials introduces additional complexities. Many potential modes of failure exist. Analyses for these modes are often not trivial, especially for those involving large out-of-plane displacements. Accurate analyses of all potential failure modes are essential. Numerous practical constraints arise from manufacturing/cost considerations and from damage tolerance, durability, and stiffness requirements. The number of design variables can be large when lamina thicknesses and stacking sequence are being optimized. A significant burden {{is placed on the}} sizing code due to the complex analyses, practical constraints, and number of design variables. On the other hand, sizing weight-efficient panels without the aid of an automated procedure is almost out of the question. The sizing code postbuckled Open-Stiffener Optimum Panels (POSTOP) has been developed to aid in the design of minimum-weight panels subject to the considerations mentioned above. Developed for postbuckled composite panels, POSTOP may be used for <b>buckling</b> <b>resistant</b> panels and metallic panels as well. The COPES/CONMIN optimizer is used in POSTOP although other options such as those in the ADS system could be substituted with relative ease. The basic elements of POSTOP are shown. Some of these elements and usage of the program are described...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a study of a {{low-cost}} structurally efficient minimum-gage shear-panel design {{that can be used}} in light helicopters are presented. The shear-panel design is based on an integrally stiffened syntactic-foam stabilized-skin with an all-bias-ply tape construction for stabilized-skin concept with an all-bias-ply tape construction for the skins. This sandwich concept is an economical way to increase the panel bending stiffness weight penalty. The panels considered in the study were designed to be <b>buckling</b> <b>resistant</b> up to 100 lbs/in. of shear load and to have an ultimate strength of 300 lbs/in. The panel concept uses unidirectional carbon-epoxy tape on a syntactic adhesive as a stiffener that is co-cured with the skin and is an effective concept for improving panel buckling strength. The panel concept also uses pultruded carbon-epoxy rods embedded in a syntactic adhesive and over-wrapped with a bias-ply carbon-epoxy tape to form a reinforcing beam which is an effective method for redistributing load around rectangular cutout. The buckling strength of the reinforced panels is 83 to 90 percent of the predicted buckling strength based on a linear buckling analysis. The maximum experimental deflection exceeds the maximum deflection predicted by a nonlinear analysis by approximately one panel thickness. The failure strength of the reinforced panels was two and a half to seven times of the buckling strength. This efficient shear-panel design concept exceeds the required ultimate strength requirement of 300 lbs/in by more than 100 percent...|$|E
