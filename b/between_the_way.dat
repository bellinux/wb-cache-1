25|$|Shenhav focuses his multiculturalist program {{mostly on}} around the postcolonialist discourse, but also {{includes}} the postmodernist and feminist ones. For Shenhav, identity is a dynamic, constructivist, random and non-primordial concept, and seeks to deconstruct {{the social and cultural}} constructions (which he sees as basically European) in order develop a perspective that would advance identity politics. Shenhav admits the existence of an asymmetry <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which he negates a substantive identity and criticizes the formation of a Hegemonic identity, while encouraging the formation of another substantive identity he wants to liberate within his identity politics. In his opinion, this can be morally justified since an analogy cannot be made between the oppressors and the oppressed and between the rulers and the ruled.|$|E

500|$|In his psychoanalytical {{study of}} the Adventures of Tintin, the {{academic}} Jean-Marie Apostolidès characterised the Secret of the Unicorn-Red Rackham's Treasure arc as being about the characters going on a [...] "treasure hunt {{that turns out to}} be at the same time a search for their roots." [...] He stated that the arc delves into Haddock's ancestry, and in doing so [...] "deals with the meanings of symbolic relations within personal life". Discussing the character of Sir Francis Haddock, he states that this ancestral figure resembles both Tintin and Haddock, [...] "the foundling and the bastard", thus making the duo brothers as well as close friends. He adds that when Captain Haddock reenacts his ancestor's fight with Rackham, he adopts his [...] "very soul, his mana, and is transformed in the process." [...] Comparing Sir Francis Haddock to Robinson Crusoe, he also draws a comparison <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that the Caribbean natives deified Sir Francis Haddock by erecting a statue of him in the same manner that the Congolese deify Tintin at the end of Tintin in the Congo. Apostolidès also discusses Red Rackham, noting that the name [...] "Red" [...] conjures up [...] "the forbidden colour of blood and wine" [...] while [...] "Rackham" [...] combines raca ("false brother") with the French word for scum (racaille), then highlighting a potential link between Rackham's name and that of Rascar Capac, an Incan mummy who appears in The Seven Crystal Balls. He further draws parallels between the model ships containing the secret parchments with the Arumbaya fetish containing a rare diamond which appears in The Broken Ear.|$|E
