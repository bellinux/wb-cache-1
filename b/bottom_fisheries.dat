40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) {{are widely used}} to protect exploited fish species {{as well as to}} conserve marine habitats and their biodiversity. They have also become a popular management tool for <b>bottom</b> trawl <b>fisheries,</b> a common fishing technique on continental shelves worldwide. The effects of bottom trawling go far beyond the impact on target species, as trawls also affect other components of the benthic ecosystem and the seabed itself. This means that for <b>bottom</b> trawl <b>fisheries,</b> MPAs can potentially be used not only to conserve target species but also to reduce impact of these side effects of the fishery. However, predicting the protective effects of MPAs is complicated because the side effects of trawling potentially alter the food-web interactions between target and non-target species. These changes in predatory and competitive interactions among fish and benthic invertebrates may have important ramifications for MPAs as tools to manage or mitigate the effects of bottom trawling. Yet, in current theory regarding the functioning of MPAs in relation to <b>bottom</b> trawl <b>fisheries,</b> such predatory and competitive interactions between species are generally not taken into account. In this study, we discuss how food-web interactions that are potentially affected by bottom trawling may alter the effectiveness of MPAs to protect (1) biodiversity and marine habitats, (2) fish populations, (3) fisheries yield, and (4) trophic structure of the community. We make the case that in order to be applicable for <b>bottom</b> trawl <b>fisheries,</b> guidelines for the implementation of MPAs must consider their potential food-web effects, at the risk of failing management. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{anglerfish}} species Lophius piscatorius and Lophius budegassa {{are among}} the most valuable fishes sought after by <b>bottom</b> <b>fisheries</b> in western and southern European waters. It is currently believed that there are two stocks for each of the two species, north and south, which determine their assessment and management. A genetic analysis using eight polymorphic microsatellite markers was carried out on samples collected from western European waters and the south-western Mediterranean Sea. The results strongly suggest that the boundary between northern and southern stocks is not genetically supported. However, populations were not genetically homogeneous. Besides a pattern of genetic differentiation between Mediterranean {{and the rest of the}} samples, the L. budegassa samples taken from the Spain Atlantic zone and from the Portugal Atlantic zone were genetically distinct, whereas the samples taken in the French Atlantic zone for the L. piscatorius species seem to be different from the rest of the samples under study.

The dominant structure-forming scleractinian corals are Lophelia pertusa and Enallopsammia profunda; other structure-forming taxa include stylasterid corals, gorgonians, black corals, and sponges. This biota is associated with hard-bottom seafloor of variable high-relief topography which can be remotely identified from bathymetric data. NOAA bathymetric contour maps and digital elevation models were used to identify and delineate the areal extent of potential DSCE habitat in the region from northeastern Florida through the Straits of Florida. These were ground-truthed with 241 dives with submersibles and remotely operated vehicles which confirmed deep-sea coral habitat. We estimate a total of 39, 910 km 2 of DSCE habitat in this region.

40|$|United Nations General Assembly Resolution 61 / 105 on {{sustainable}} fisheries (UNGA 2007) establishes three difficult questions for participants in high-seas <b>bottom</b> <b>fisheries</b> to answer: 1) Where are vulnerable marine systems (VMEs) likely to occur?; 2) What is {{the likelihood of}} fisheries interaction with these VMEs?; and 3) What might qualify as adequate conservation and management measures to prevent significant adverse impacts? This paper develops an approach to answering these questions for bottom trawling activities in the Convention Area of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) within a quantitative risk assessment and cost : benefit analysis framework. The predicted distribution of deep-sea corals from habitat suitability models is used to answer the first question. Distribution of historical bottom trawl effort is used to answer the second, with estimates of seabed areas swept by bottom trawlers being used to develop discounting factors for reduced biodiversity in previously fished areas. These are used in a quantitative ecological risk assessment approach to guide spatial protection planning to address the third question. The coral VME likelihood (average, discounted, predicted coral habitat suitability) of existing spatial closures implemented by New Zealand within the SPRFMO area is evaluated. Historical catch {{is used as a}} measure of cost to industry in a cost : benefit analysis of alternative spatial closure scenarios. Results indicate that current closures within the New Zealand SPRFMO area bottom trawl footprint are suboptimal for protection of VMEs. Examples of alternative trawl closure scenarios are provided to illustrate how the approach could be used to optimise protection of VMEs under chosen management objectives, balancing protection of VMEs against economic loss to commercial fishers from closure of historically fished areas...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{developments}} in deep-sea conservation in the North Atlantic over the past year relevant to the ATLAS Project. These include the adoption of a new EU regulation, in the context of the EU’s reformed Common Fisheries Policy, for the management of deep-sea fisheries in EU waters and the designation of large areas of the deep-sea within Canadian and US waters as closed to <b>bottom</b> <b>fisheries</b> or as marine sanctuaries to protect deep-sea habitats. The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization and the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission – the two regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) regulating deep-sea fishing on the high seas of the north Atlantic have established procedures for ongoing scientific review and consideration of new regulations to address the environmental impacts of deep-sea fisheries. A third RFMO, the General Fisheries Commission of the Mediterranean has recently begun doing the same. The UN General Assembly in November 2016 conducted a ten-year review of the actions taken by States and RFMOs to manage deep-sea fisheries to protect deep-sea ecosystems and called for a new set of actions including enhanced marine scientific research in a resolution adopted by the General Assembly in December 2016. In relation to deep-sea mining, the UN’s International Seabed Authority (ISA) is in the process of developing environmental regulations for the licensing of commercial seabed mining. Much of the discussion surrounding the development of the regulations centres on the role of science, scientific review and evaluation and incorporating scientific uncertainty in the regulatory process. In addition, a science based initiative to develop a proposal for an ISA regional environment management plan (EMP) for the mining of seabed massive sulphides associated with both active and inactive hydrothermal vents along a portion of the northern Mid Atlantic Ridge has been underway for the past two years with a view to prompting a formal process of negotiation by the ISA to develop and establish an EMP for the region. The presentation will cover these and other initiatives, including brief mention of the negotiations currently taking place under the auspices of the UN General Assembly to develop a new treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, and the opportunities for the ATLAS Project to provide scientific information, advice and recommendations relevant to these processes...|$|E

Both fisheries target demersal as well as mid pelagic fishes, such as travellys (parava), mullets (galmalu) and barracudas (ulava). As the dispute had an adverse impact on the social harmony in the fishing community of the area, a socio-economic survey was conducted to study the underlying factors and to suggest policy measures to resolve the issue. The laila fishermen were resident fishermen in the Kalpitiya Peninsula while bottom long line fishermen were migratory fishermen from Negombo and Chilaw areas in {{the west coast of}} Sri Lanka. The Kalpitiya peninsula is located in the North West coast, some 50 km away from the west coast. Although the educational level and literacy rate of the laila community was below that of the bottom long line community, the laila community was economically better off. The net economic returns from laila fishery were superior to that from <b>bottom</b> long line <b>fishery.</b> The boat owner's and crew's share per operation of laila fishery were Rs. 3, 736 and Rs. 947 respectively.

40|$|The cruise is a {{contribution}} to SEAFO resulting from a co-operation between SEAFO, the EAF-Nansen project, and the FAO Deep-sea programme. The aim is to facilitate activities {{in support of the}} efforts by RFMOs to meet objectives in relation to the United Nations General Asssembly (UNGA) resolution 61 / 105 and the associated FAO Guidelines on <b>Bottom</b> <b>Fisheries</b> in the high seas. Furthermore, the southeastern Atlantic ABNJ was selected by the recently initiated GEF-sponsored FAO ABNJ programme (“Common Oceans”) as an area of particular attention, involving the relevant RFMO with competent to regulate bottom fishing in that region is the Southeast Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO). Despite a shortage of data on the occurrence of ‘vulnerable marine ecosystems’ (VMEs, as defined in the FAO Guidelines), SEAFO has introduced comprehensive measures to protect such ecosystems from significant adverse impacts within the convention area. The convention area consist of agreed limited ‘existing fishing areas’, i. e. areas were fisheries were conducted within a recent reference period, and more extensive ‘new fishing areas’ where this was not the case. Commercial harvesting is essentially restricted to the ‘existing fishing areas’, but further regulated by other measures such as species-specific TACs, gear restrictions and other measures aimed to conserve e. g. sharks. To conduct exploratory fisheries in ‘new fishing areas’ parties need to submit a notification and detailed plan and report to the Organization for approval. SEAFO has furthermore closed 10 subareas of the convention area to all fishing activity, a regulation most recently revised in 2011. Best available bathymetry data were compiled to locate subareas recognised in the FAO guidelines as VME features, essentially primarily seamounts. As fishing is restricted to the upper 2000 m of any feature, a map of areas shallower than 2000 m was the basis of further selection. In SEAFO such areas are seamounts or seamount complexes of various sizes and shapes. The spatial distribution of VME indicators such as corals and sponges (i. e. as given in FAO guidelines) is not well known in SEAFO, but the benthic and pelagic biogeographical patterns have been described. It was therefore decided to close 10 potential fishing areas that represented the range of features and the major biogeographical zones of the region. Some of these were actual fishing areas; others were either not fished or lightly fished. The end result was the set of ten closures with various shapes and sizes, ranging from single seamounts to rather wider areas comprising several seamounts or mid-Atlantic Ridge segments. While SEAFO took significant steps to ensure conservation of VMEs, the shortage of information on the distribution patterns of VME indicators remains unsatisfactory. Some new data were acquired by recent fishing experiments in existing and new fishing areas, and by Spanish-Namibian research activity on the Valdivia Bank. However, even within the relatively restricted actual fishing areas, the documentation remains scattered and limited. Similarly, the Scientific Committee of SEAFO struggles with data shortage on the fish resources actually harvested in the convention area, primarily Patagonian toothfish, pelagic armourhead, alfonsino, deep-sea red crab, and associated bycatch species. Stock assessments are generally highly uncertain and fully dependant on fisheries-generated data, hence conservation measures implemented by SEAFO remain largely precautionary rather than tuned to good estimates of abundances and productivity. Catches currently remain rather limited, i. e. collectively less than 1000 t, but some species are valuable and tend to attract interest from fishing parties that would value not only enhanced opportunities but also management based on more reliable stock assessments. This project thus aims to supplement and extend knowledge and databases on VME indicators as well as fisheries resources and will accordingly conduct targeted investigations in the currently used fishing areas of the convention area, primarily on the Walvis Ridge. In addition, some of the fishing closures will be visited to document presence-absence of VME indicators and describe distribution patterns. New data from these targeted studies will enhance the quality of fish stock assessments and help analyse the appropriateness of VME closures currently implemented solely based on feature characteristics and biogeographical affinity. Main conclusions: VMEs indicators were located in all seamounts prospected but differences in structure and development state were observed. In some seamounts coral rubble, sediment-clogged, mostly dead coral framework and living coral framework were observed from the base to the summit all along the slope. Current system associated to each seamount, depth and probably other depth-dependent environmental factors driven the presence and development of deep-water reefs. Continuous research efforts are needed to increase knowledge about biodiversity and structure.

Physical surrogacy, where benthic biodiversity is characterised based on its relationship with environmental parameters, was explored {{as a means of}} extrapolating the distribution and biomass of benthic species from sample sites to seascapes of the deep-sea. The evaluation of surrogates focused on those benthic species considered most susceptible to disturbance from bottom fishing gears including sponges and corals (termed ‘vulnerable taxa’) and data from the sub-Antarctic Heard and McDonalds Islands (HIMI) region. HIMI hosts an established bottom fishery with protection for biodiversity afforded through a large marine protected area (MPA). However whether the MPA meets CAR principles (comprehensive, adequate and representative) in the context of vulnerable taxa remains largely unknown due to a limited understanding of the HIMI benthic habitats. To readdress the paucity of basic information and provide empirical data with which to develop predictive models, quantitative benthic samples were collected from 104 stations in depths of 200 to 1000 meters and analysed to document benthic biodiversity and community structure across HIMI. Data from HIMI were then used to develop surrogacy methods that were applied to other regions in the deep sea. A total of 312 taxa were recorded in the deep-sea at HIMI. Diversity was dominated by sessile suspension-feeders, including numerous undescribed and possibly endemic taxa, and was similar to other sub-Antarctic islands but lower than rich areas on the continental shelves of Antarctica and Australia. Analyses of assemblage structure using taxa biomass records and the clustering method 'Partitioning Around Medoids' revealed a clear zonation between HIMI’s eastern and western banks, the central plateau, south-facing slopes and waters deeper than 500 m, which was driven mostly by changes in seafloor current speed, temperature and the concentration of particulate organic carbon. Disturbance from bottom fishing was not identified as an important proxy for biodiversity despite extensive trawling for more than 10 years, and instead suggests a strong link between benthos and environmental parameters, highlighting the vulnerability of these communities to changing environmental conditions. Similarly, the restricted distributions of many taxa and levels of endemicity in some groups highlight the uniqueness and vulnerability of the HIMI benthic habitat and importance for conservation. Nonetheless, it was acknowledged that the study failed to sample the most heavily trawled areas at HIMI and that further taxonomic scrutiny (e. g. bryozoans are largely unsorted at this stage) might impact the study conclusions. From empirical data at HIMI, ten vulnerable taxa were selected for which there were sufficient observations for model training (n > 50). Four modelling approaches were contrasted to determine an appropriate method to model and predict vulnerable taxa across HIMI using physical surrogates: generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM), boosted regression trees (BRT) and random forests (RF). For each method, two sequential models were constructed; one to predict the occurrence probability of each vulnerable taxa (termed ‘occurrence model’) and one to predict the biomass of that vulnerable taxa given their presence in an area (termed ‘biomass model’). To contrast model performance, data were split into training and test datasets (cross-validation) and predictions evaluated using a series of performance indices relating to accuracy, calibration and bias between observed and predicted values. RF was identified as the preferred method to further explore and predict vulnerable taxa across HIMI due to consistent good performance (i. e. good accuracy, good calibration and low bias between observed and predicted values) and hence predictions were made using this approach. The predictions of occurrence and biomass of vulnerable taxa across the HIMI seascape indicated a higher frequency and biomass in shallow depths (< 500 m), and on complex seascape features (e. g. HIMI's banks and craggy slopes), compared with the deeper areas of the plateau. Analysis of predictions using the conservation planning software Zonation highlighted HIMI's banks and numerous areas across the central plateau and continental slope as priority areas for conservation, many of which are currently protected by the MPA. To test the broader applicability of the RF framework, models of vulnerable taxa were subsequently constructed for the continental shelf of East Antarctica (30 °E – 150 °E) where the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is considering the adoption of a Representative System of MPAs (RSMPA). Like HIMI, the benthos here are poorly described and marine conservation planning may benefit from model estimates to assist decision making. Benthic samples from the region and collocated environmental variables (including sea ice properties) were used to parameterise RF models for eight vulnerable taxa that were classified using the same principles as for HIMI. Both the occurrence and biomass models returned high accuracy according to the indices used, suggesting a high level of confidence in predictions across East Antarctica, and highlighting the transferability of the RF framework to other seascapes. Model estimates revealed a number of hotspots, namely the Prydz Bay region, but also Gunnerus Ridge, west of both Enderby Land and Casey Station and patches between Adelie Land and George V Land, the majority of which are encompassed within the proposed RSMPA. Importantly the model estimates presented in this study suggest that CAR principles have been achieved for vulnerable benthos in the HIMI and (proposed) East Antarctic MPAs. In developing these MPAs, the distribution and hence representativeness of protection for benthic habitats and their biota within the MPA was inferred largely from physical variables as the empirical data required to characterise these habitats were sparse or not available at the time. My predictive modeling results that do incorporate empirical data and have produced similar recommendations for biodiversity conservation at HIMI and in East Antarctica suggest that the use of physical surrogates were an adequate tool for marine planning in the absence of biological data in these systems. More broadly, the results suggest that management or mitigation measures for benthos based on physical parameters may provide adequate precautionary management in other marine ecosystems where the empirical data necessary to evaluate the benthic habitat are lacking. The accuracy of predictions and transferability of the RF framework means that methods developed here might be readily applied to other seascapes where decision-making may benefit from predictions. Sample size, model extent and data resolution were all potential sources of uncertainty which would best be addressed through targeted field sampling and surveys. However given the immediacy of the issue of managing bottom fishing to prevent significant adverse interactions with vulnerable ecosystems, and the practical difficulties associated with obtaining empirical data, surrogate-based management is the only practical means to make reasoned decisions about high seas resource management and {{for the establishment of a}} CAR system of MPAs throughout the Southern Ocean...|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of deep-water corals of the Flemish Cap, Flemish Pass, and the Grand Banks of Newfoundland is described based on bycatch from Spanish/EU bottom trawl groundfish surveys between 40 and 1500 m depth. In all, 37 taxa of deep-water corals {{were identified in}} the study area: 21 alcyonaceans (including the gorgonians), 11 pennatulaceans, 2 solitary scleractinians, and 3 antipatharians. The greatest diversity of coral species was on the Flemish Cap. Corals were most abundant along the continental slope, between 600 and 1300 m depth. Soft corals (alcyonaceans), sea fans (gorgonians), and black corals (antipatharians) were most common on bedrock or gravel, whereas sea pens (pennatulaceans) and cup corals (solitary scleractinians) were found primarily on mud. The biomass of deep-water corals in the bycatches was highest in previously lightly trawled or untrawled areas, and generally low in the regularly fished grounds. The information derived from bottom-trawl bycatch records {{is not sufficient to}} map vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) accurately, but pending more detailed habitat mapping, it provides a valuable indication of the presence/absence of VMEs {{that can be used to}} propose the candidate areas for <b>bottom</b> <b>fishery</b> closures or other conservation measures. ...|$|R
