500|$|The {{novel is}} {{characterized}} as a [...] "dramatic" [...] Bildungsroman with a [...] "big twist" [...] because the coming-of-age story is revealed to be the incorrect one: after being nurtured as a woman, Cal must instead learn to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> The book has [...] "twodistinct and occasionally warring halves". Whereas the first part is about hermaphrodites, the second is about Greeks. The latter half, [...] "full of incest, violence, and terrible family secrets", was considered by Daniel Mendelsohn, an author and critic, {{to be more effective}} because Middlesex is largely about how Callie inherited the momentous gene that [...] "ends up defining her indefinable life".|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Johnson {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to stay with his cousins, the Fords, at Pedmore, Worcestershire. There he bonded with Cornelius Ford, the son of his mother's brother, and Ford employed his knowledge of the classics to tutor Johnson while he was not attending school. Johnson enjoyed his time with Ford, who encouraged Johnson to pursue his studies and to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of letters. Johnson remembered one moment of Ford's teachings: Ford told him to [...] "grasp the leading praecognita of all things... grasps the trunk hard only, and you will shake all the branches". Ford was a successful, well-connected academic, familiar with many society figures such as Alexander Pope.|$|E

His father fought the disease for five years before dying while Wilson was attending Londonderry High School; Wilson today says he had to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> when {{his father was}} diagnosed. In a 2011 story, ESPN.com writer Elizabeth Merrill said about Wilson's high school years, [...] "He was an honor roll student at Londonderry, but clashed with various authority figures who didn't appreciate his occasional lack of a filter." [...] In the same story, a number of Londonderry faculty speculated that some teachers didn't understand Wilson's life situation at the time. Art Psaledas, an assistant principal at the school, added, [...] "It happened at probably the worst time anybody could lose your dad.

500|$|Kubrick scholar Michel Ciment, {{discussing}} Kubrick's {{attitude toward}} human aggression and instinct, observes: [...] "The bone cast {{into the air}} by the ape (now <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>man)</b> is transformed {{at the other extreme}} of civilization, by one of those abrupt ellipses characteristic of the director, into a spacecraft {{on its way to the}} moon." [...] In contrast to Ciment's reading of a cut to a serene [...] "other extreme of civilization", science fiction novelist Robert Sawyer, speaking in the Canadian documentary 2001 and Beyond, saw it as a cut from a bone to a nuclear weapons platform, explaining that [...] "what we see is not how far we've leaped ahead, what we see is that today, '2001', and four million years ago on the African veldt, it's exactly the same—the power of mankind is the power of its weapons. It's a continuation, not a discontinuity in that jump." ...|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{was born}} in Winchester, Massachusetts on March 16, 1982. While he was in second grade, he moved to Londonderry, New Hampshire. Today, he talks little of his {{childhood}} except to discuss his father, Mike Wilson, who was an Air Force veteran and a demanding perfectionist. During fall, he would have Brian bag leaves and bury them in the woods; and in winter, he would have Brian spend seven hours shoveling snow on weekends. Brian said in a 2011 interview, [...] "I think that's how {{you need to be}} raised. It's not your friend, it's your dad. And he's going to be strict. And one day you're going to understand why. And sometimes, it's a little too late. They might pass away, and you might not get that chance to say thanks or understand why you did those things.

500|$|The poem {{consists}} of an address by the speaker to an unnamed listener, and contains two parallel sections, about two of Sappho's brothers, Charaxos and Larichos. Sappho hopes that Charaxos will return successfully from his trading voyage, and that Larichos will grow up and <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> [...] In the first surviving stanza of the poem, the speaker upbraids the addressee for repeating that Charaxos will return home safely, saying that only the gods can know such a thing. [...] In the next stanza, the speaker tells the addressee to send her to pray to Hera for Charaxos' safe return. [...] This is followed by an exhortation to trust in the gods for everything else, and two traditional pieces of wisdom – that fortunes are changeable, and that the gods can bless those they favour with good fortune. [...] The poem ends with the speaker hoping that Larichos will [...] " [...] his head high" [...] and [...] "become an ανερ [...] in all senses", as Obbink puts it.|$|E

500|$|First season regular {{cast member}} Malcolm David Kelley {{returned}} in an uncredited cameo {{for a single}} scene as Michael's ten-year-old son Walt without dialogue and from a distance. Fifteen-year-old Kelley claimed that make-up was applied to him in an effort for him to look younger; however, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse clarified that visual effects supervisor Mitch Suskin had actually composited into the shot some footage of Kelley from production on the first season. Because Kelley was so obscured and his name did {{not appear in the}} cast list, television critics were convinced that Walt had been recast. Steve Heisler of Time Out stated that [...] "You gotta hand it to the Lost writers: For weeks, people have speculated about how they were going to treat Walt's inevitable pubescence. See, the show's set in 2004, and only a few months have passed since the plane crash. Yet … it's been years, and … Kelley has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> So what did they do? … They just didn't show him. Clever." [...] TMZ's Daniel thought that [...] "Not showing Walt is a clever way to cover up the fact that he [...] a foot taller than he should be … I understand that they pretty much can't show Walt ever again". Wizards Nikki Stafford {{went so far as to}} remark that [...] "That kid standing in the window was definitely not Malcolm David Kelley … I don't think Kelley will be back to reprise the role." ...|$|E
500|$|At that time, the Yellow River was flooding, causing {{widespread}} devastation to {{the people}} and the rice harvests. As Luan Da had claimed that he could dam the river, Emperor Wu felt that {{it would be wise to}} encourage the mystic to take up the task by quickly pleasing him. The emperor granted Luan Da the title of the General of Five Boons, and almost as an afterthought, three other such titles: the General of Heavenly Practitioners, the General of the Earth Practitioners, and General Grand Communicator. Emperor Wu also lavished gifts on him; he was granted the marquisate of Letong, giving him some 2,000 households to rule over, and the emperor also gave him a luxurious mansion, a thousand servants, opulent transportation, many decorations, a seal labelled [...] "General of Heavenly Way", and even the hand in marriage of Princess Wei Zifu, the emperor's eldest daughter, accompanied by a dowry estimated at 10,000 catties of gold. The emperor himself, along with envoys, members of the royal family, and high-ranking officials often invited Luan Da to dine or paid him house calls merely to ask how he was doing. With his marquisate and five generalships, Luan Da had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of great standing only a few months after his introduction to the emperor. He was no longer merely Emperor Wu's subject, but an envoy of the immortal beings with status equal to the emperor.|$|E
500|$|The {{story begins}} with a dialog between two characters. The first asks the other [...] "You do know why you're here?", and the second replies: [...] "Yes, there's great {{confusion}} on earth, and the power that is has concluded the following: Perfect man has visited earth already and His voice was heard; The voice of imperfect man must now be made manifest; and I have been selected as the most likely candidate." [...] This statement is followed by [...] "Where's the Show" [...] and [...] "Let Me Be a Man". In the medley, Nelson depicts {{the birth of the}} character, who implores God to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> The song is followed by [...] "In God's Eyes", depicting the character learning to act as a good Samaritan. In [...] "Family Bible", the character describes his memories of and nostalgia for his childhood, the times with his family and the reading of the family Bible. [...] "It's Not for Me to Understand" [...] depicts the character praying, after watching a blind child listening to other children playing and finding himself unable to understand why God allowed that to happen. God replies to the Imperfect Man, [...] "It's not for you to reason why, you too are blind without my eyes, so question not what I command". In the last stanza, the character now expresses [...] his fear of the Lord and his reluctance to question the unfairness of the world again. The medley [...] "These Are Difficult Times / Remember the Good Times", describes the character's bad times and his recovery by remembering the good times.|$|E

[...] The temptation {{in the wilderness}} and again in Gethsemane exemplifies this arena of temptation. [...] Regarding the temptation of performing a sign that would affirm his sonship by throwing himself from the pinnacle of the temple, MacLeod observes, [...] "The sign was for himself: a temptation to seek reassurance, as if to say, ‘the real question is my own sonship. [...] I must forget all else and all others and all further service until that is clear.’" [...] MacLeod places this struggle {{in the context of}} the incarnation, [...] "...he has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> and must accept not only the appearance but the reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeffrey Dean Morgan {{returned}} as Denny Duquette {{for a final}} appearance in the series. Rhimes noted that his return, unlike previous ones, were as Death and caused him to wear black clothes and speak sparingly.

[...] "She is the thing her mother wished for her. She is extraordinary. Because, {{to get past the}} crap of your past? To move on? To let the past go and change? That is extraordinary. To love?

2500|$|One of {{the main}} reasons why Yorkshire were {{prepared}} to offer the captaincy to Sutcliffe in 1927 was because he was not perceived to be the typical professional. Sutcliffe set high standards for himself and was determined to get on in life, as well as cricket, and make a lot of money. Wally Hammond, who eventually did turn amateur and captained England, was another example. Sutcliffe took pains to modify his accent and, as Neville Cardus commented, Sutcliffe eventually spoke [...] "not with the accents of Yorkshire but of Teddington". Cardus remarked on the Savile Row suits worn by Sutcliffe and Hammond: [...] "The county cricketer has in certain instances <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of bourgeois profession". [...] But Bill Bowes, an ex-grammar school boy who had benefited from educational reforms that were unavailable to Sutcliffe and the older professionals, regarded Sutcliffe as a hero. Writing about Sutcliffe, Bowes pointed out that Sutcliffe was [...] "no ordinary man" [...] and stressed that [...] "professionalism was very important to him".|$|E

2500|$|The Son of God is {{the spirit}} who will become incarnate as Jesus Christ, though he is never named explicitly, since {{he has not yet}} entered human form. Milton's God refers to the Son as [...] "My word, my wisdom, and effectual might" [...] (3.170), but Milton {{believed}} in a subordinationist doctrine of Christology that regarded the Son as secondary to the Father, His [...] "great Vice-regent" [...] (5.609). The poem is not explicitly anti-trinitarian, but is consistent with Milton's convictions. The Son is the ultimate hero of the epic and is infinitely powerful, single-handedly defeating Satan and his followers and driving them into Hell. The Son of God tells Adam and Eve about God's judgment after their sin. He sacrificially volunteers to journey to the World, <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> himself, and redeem the Fall of Man through his own death and resurrection. In the final scene, a vision of Salvation through the Son of God is revealed to Adam by Michael. Still, the name, Jesus of Nazareth, and the details of Jesus' story are not depicted in the poem., though they are alluded to when Michael explains that [...] "Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call," [...] prefigures the Son of God, [...] "his name and office bearing" [...] to [...] "quell / The adversarie Serpent, and bring back [...] long wanderd man / Safe to eternal Paradise of rest." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though Schleicher {{approved}} of Papen's politics, a certain tension had emerged partly because Papen had proved himself far more aggressive and assertive than Schleicher had expected as the goofy Fränzchen had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who {{saw himself as}} one of history's Great Men and partly because Schleicher dis{{approved of}} Papen's style of provoking ordinary people with the general telling the chancellor that insulting people was {{not the best way}} to make them like you. Schleicher wanted the [...] "New State" [...] to enjoy popular legitimacy, and was increasing convinced that Papen's massive unpopularity would denude the [...] "New State" [...] of any legitimacy. On 27 October 1932, the Supreme Court of Germany in a convoluted ruling declared that Papen's coup deposing the Prussian government was illegal as Papen's lawyers had failed to prove his claim that the coup was necessary because the Social Democrats and Communists were allegedly about to merger, but also allowed for Papen to retain his control of Prussia, giving no means for Braun to resume office as the court ruled that the Reich government could depose a Land government if law and order were threatened. In November 1932, Papen showed his contempt for the terms of the Treaty of Versailles by passing an umbau (rebuilding) programme for the German Navy of one aircraft carrier, six cruisers, six destroyer flotillas, sixteen U-boats and six battleships, intended to allow Germany to control both the North Sea and the Baltic. Versailles had forbidden Germany to have battleships, aircraft carriers and submarines.|$|E
