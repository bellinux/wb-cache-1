5|$|After the military, {{the second}} largest and most {{important}} industry for Hampton Roads and Norfolk based on economic impact are the region's cargo ports. Headquartered in Norfolk, the Virginia Port Authority (VPA) is a Commonwealth of Virginia owned-entity that, in turn, owns and operates three major port facilities in Hampton Roads for <b>break-bulk</b> and container type cargo. In Norfolk, Norfolk International Terminals (NIT) represents one of those three facilities and {{is home to the}} world's largest and fastest container cranes. Together, the three terminals of the VPA handled a total of over 2 million TEUs and 475,000 tons of breakbulk cargo in 2006, making it the second busiest port on the east coast of North America by total cargo volume after the Port of New York and New Jersey.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, {{the company}} began {{investigating}} the possibility of containerization, and sent research teams into 28 major ports. Following their reports, Davies began integrating containers into the company's business. By 1961, the company had begun launching ships capable of container transport, the first two of these being the combination <b>break-bulk</b> - container vessels SS President Tyler and SS President Lincoln. Ports also began adapting to the new container-based system, although many potential customers were still wary. By {{the end of the}} decade, the company was still launching combination ships rather than fully cellular container ships as already employed by several U.S., British, European and Japanese lines, yet by 1969, 23% of the company's business moved via container.|$|E
500|$|In the 1860s, Pennsylvania {{oil fields}} {{became a major}} {{supplier}} of oil, and a center of innovation after Edwin Drake had struck oil near Titusville, Pennsylvania. <b>Break-bulk</b> boats and barges were originally used to transport Pennsylvania oil in [...] wooden barrels. But transport by barrel had several problems. The first problem was weight: the standard empty barrel weighed , representing 20% of the total weight of a full barrel. Other problems with barrels were their expense, their tendency to leak, {{and the fact that}} they were generally used only once. The expense was significant: for example, in the early years of the Russian oil industry, barrels accounted for half the cost of petroleum production.|$|E

2500|$|Lack of {{innovation}} by traditional industries, such as forest products, combined with high labour costs {{have reduced the}} industrial base of Thunder Bay by close to 60%. The grain trade has declined because {{of the loss of}} grain transportation subsidies and the loss of European markets. The gradual transition from shipping by train and boat to shipping by truck, and the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement have ended Thunder Bay's privileged position as a linchpin in Canadian east-west freight-handling trade. As a result, the city has lost its traditional [...] as a <b>break-bulk</b> point. However, in recent years shipments through the port of Thunder Bay have stabilized, and remains {{an important part of the}} Saint Lawrence Seaway.|$|E
2500|$|The {{assumption}} at {{the time}} was that car owners would drive to the nearest railhead (which was usually the junction where the closed branch line would otherwise have taken them) and continue their journey onwards by train. In practice, having left home in their cars, people used them for the whole journey. Similarly for freight: without branch lines, the railways' ability to transport goods [...] "door to door" [...] was dramatically reduced. As in the passenger model, it was assumed that lorries would pick up goods and transport them to the nearest railhead, where they would be taken across the country by train, unloaded onto another lorry and taken to their destination. The development of the motorway network, the advent of containerisation, improvements in lorries and the economic costs of having two <b>break-bulk</b> points combined to make long-distance road transport a more viable alternative.|$|E
2500|$|The {{increasing}} use of {{air travel}} meant that the company's passenger services had steadily been declining throughout the 1960s, and by 1973, the last APL liner, the SS President Wilson, completed her final round-the-world trip and was sold off. Also in 1973, American Mail Line was fully absorbed into APL, and its ships were subsequently given traditional [...] "President" [...] names. By 1971, the use of containers had again increased; 58% of the company's business moved via container. During the early 1970s, the company converted many of its traditional <b>break-bulk</b> freight and combination ships into more efficient container-only ships, and ordered four new-built container ships. However, in 1977 the line pulled back from worldwide freight service to focus on purely trans-Pacific routes. In 1978, the company began work {{on the concept of}} seamless integrated intermodal service in the U.S. market: the idea of moving containerized goods via ship, train and truck under one company identity. By 1979, APL started the LinerTrain, a direct rail land-bridge service transporting containers from Los Angeles to New York using its own rail cars, leading to the most reliable delivery of containers of the time. At the same time, the company built its three largest vessels to date: three C-9 class diesel-powered container ships, the first of which was the President Lincoln.|$|E
5000|$|Break-bulk: <b>Break-bulk</b> (also {{known as}} split case) is a lower-capacity {{version of the}} bulk department. Orders usually contain part boxes or items not {{requiring}} pallets. Due {{to the number of}} smaller customers a distribution center may serve, a <b>break-bulk</b> department may need more workers than a bulk department. A <b>break-bulk</b> department usually uses trolleys or, for palleted/heavy orders, small electric PPT or walkie low lift trucks. Items shipped by <b>break-bulk</b> are usually stored in pick, which are usually the bottom two pick-faces of warehouse racking. A pick-face is the space on such a racking system onto which a pallet can be loaded.|$|E

50|$|Break bulk {{continues}} to hold an advantage in areas where port development has not kept pace with shipping technology; <b>break-bulk</b> shipping requires relatively minimal shore facilities—a wharf for the ship to tie to, dock workers to assist in unloading, warehouses to store materials for later reloading onto other forms of transport. As a result, {{there are still some}} areas where <b>break-bulk</b> shipping {{continues to}} thrive. Goods shipped <b>break-bulk</b> can also be offloaded onto smaller vessels and lighters for transport into even the most minimally-developed port which the normally large container ships, tankers, and bulk carriers {{might not be able to}} access due to size and/or water depth. In addition, some ports capable of accepting larger container ships/tankers/bulk transporters still require goods to be offloaded in <b>break-bulk</b> fashion; for example, in the outlying islands of Tuvalu, fuel oil for the power stations is delivered in bulk but has to be offloaded in barrels.|$|E

50|$|Shippers {{with enough}} volume of LTL freight {{may choose to}} use a full {{truckload}} carrier to move the freight directly to a <b>break-bulk</b> facility of an LTL carrier. For example, a North Carolina shipper with a large quantity of shipments bound for Western US States (for example, California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho) {{may be able to}} realize significant cost savings by having a FTL carrier, known as a linehaul carrier, transport the freight to a <b>break-bulk</b> facility in a central location near the ultimate destination of the freight (in this example, delivery to a <b>break-bulk</b> facility in California for parceling out into LTL lots for transport to the final destinations). The use of an FTL carrier to transport this freight generally provides an overall cost savings because the freight will travel fewer miles in the FTL carrier's network, as well as a reduced overall fuel surcharge cost—that is, one FTL carrier travels the distance to the <b>break-bulk</b> facility for a single carrier's price while using only the fuel required for that FTL truck, vs. several LTL carriers at each carrier's price, each covering some of the same path to the final destinations and each using the fuel required for each one of the LTL trucks. A further benefit is realized in both loading cost and product damage because the freight will not need to be unloaded and reloaded as many times. Additionally, this reduces the incidence of loss and the opportunity for pilfering or theft, because all of the freight travels together and is not broken down into LTL loads until it reaches the <b>break-bulk</b> distribution facility.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of dry cargo: bulk cargo and break bulk cargo. Bulk cargoes, like grain or coal, are transported {{unpackaged}} in the hull of the ship, generally in large volume. <b>Break-bulk</b> cargoes, on the other hand, are transported in packages, and are generally manufactured goods. [...] Before the advent of containerization in the 1950s, <b>break-bulk</b> items were loaded, lashed, unlashed and unloaded from the ship one piece at a time. However, by grouping cargo into containers, [...] of cargo, or up to about 64000 lb, is moved at once and each container is secured to the ship once in a standardized way. [...] Containerization has increased the efficiency of moving traditional <b>break-bulk</b> cargoes significantly, reducing shipping time by 84% and costs by 35%. [...] In 2001, more than 90% of world trade in non-bulk goods was transported in ISO containers.
