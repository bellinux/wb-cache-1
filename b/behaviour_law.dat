By 1958, women parliamentarians were stating that prostitution was the most important social problem of all time, demanding a further commission (1958-1962). By now, there was yet another reconceptualisation of prostitution, from psychopathology to sociopathology, and the resulting legislation replaced the vagrancy law with the antisocial <b>behaviour</b> <b>law</b> in 1964. Regulation of prostitution passed to this Act, but retained the concept of normative social citizenship based on honest labour. In practice, the law was used less and less, was successfully challenged in court in 1967, and was replaced in 1969 by the Social Services Act of 1980, till the Prohibition of Purchase of Sexual Services Act of 1999 (amended 2005).|$|E

These models require accurate definition of the main bearing stiffness. In this paper, an investigation of this stiffness is presented. The clearance effect is studied using a smooth bearing model. It is manifested for low shaft displacement. The hydrodynamic assessment model shows that the oil film has no stiffness for low loads and it is infinitely rigid for important loads. The deformation stiffness is determined using a suitable finite elements model based on real CADs. As a result, a main bearing <b>behaviour</b> <b>law</b> is proposed.

40|$|International audienceThe need {{to model}} {{fracture}} in crashworthiness {{by means of}} finite element codes is a real challenge for research. Before implementing fracture criteria, an excellent knowledge of the stress and strain states in the material just before the crack appearance is the first condition necessary to ensure the model development. At present, most of the material <b>behaviour</b> <b>laws,</b> for example for steel, are only defined until the maximum force when necking occurs. For polymers, the early occurrence of the diffuse necking leads to an experimental technique in which the speed loading is controlled in real time to maintain a constant strain rate during the test. This technique is not however used, due to technical limitations, for high strain rate <b>behaviour</b> <b>laws.</b> In this paper, the authors propose to use the heterogeneity of the displacement field {{on the surface of}} the tensile specimen as an initial condition to identify <b>behaviour</b> <b>laws.</b> The method developed uses the information in all the surface zone of the specimen by using digital image correlation.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{microscopic}} origins of friction, we build a framework {{to describe the}} collective behaviour {{of a large number}} of individual micro-junctions forming a macroscopic frictional interface. Each micro-junction can switch in time between two states: A pinned state characterized by a displacement-dependent force, and a slipping state characterized by a time-dependent force. Instead of tracking each micro-junction individually, the state of the interface is described by two coupled distributions for (i) the stretching of pinned junctions and (ii) the time spent in the slipping state. We show how this framework represents an overarching structure for important models existing in the friction literature. We then use it to study systematically the effect of the time-scale that controls the duration of the slipping state. We first find the steady-state friction force as a function of the sliding velocity. As the framework allows for a whole family of micro-junction <b>behaviour</b> <b>laws,</b> we show how these laws can be chosen to obtain monotonic (strengthening or weakening) or non-monotonic velocity dependence at the macroscale. By then considering transient situations, we predict that the macroscopic static friction coefficient is strongly influenced by the way the interface was prepared, in particular by the slip dynamics of the previous sliding event. We also show that slow slip spontaneously occurs in the framework for a wide range of <b>behaviour</b> <b>laws.</b> Comment: 20 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{durability}} in reinforced concrete structures {{is a major}} case of concern nowadays. The problem of leakage due to cracking phenomena in critical structures such as nuclear power plants is specifically significant. In these structures, the number of cracks, their distribution and opening are needed to predict leakage possibilities. These variables depend on both the <b>behaviour</b> <b>law</b> of concrete and the <b>behaviour</b> <b>law</b> of steel-concrete interface. This article intends to compare experimental and modelling results focusing on interface zone between concrete and steel reinforcement. The first step consists in performing tests to capture behaviour of reinforced concrete prismatic elements subjected to pure tension. Crack opening along these structures is investigated by using digital image correlation (DIC), which allows the observation of crack propagation during loading. Next, the tension test of reinforced concrete is modelled in two different ways. Firstly, the connection zone between concrete and steel bar {{is assumed to be}} perfect (none-sliding connection). Then, a hypothesis of interface zone model between these two materials which allows plastic sliding [1], is considered. An orthotropic model of concrete based on plasticity and damage theories is used for this modelling. The model is able to predict crack opening and manage its reclosure [2]. Finally, results of the test are compared to the both modelling. A discussion concerning the need of interface model finishes this paper...|$|E

As a {{complement}} to classic characterization {{in the identification}} of elastomers, full-field measurement methods such as image stereo correlation can undeniably contribute to the validation of elastomeric connection behaviour. Indeed, these measurements enable three-dimensional displacement and strains fields over the totality of the studied surface to be finely reached.
