In this work, we mathematically investigate the DISs in phase transforming electrodes using a core-shell structural model. We examine the concentration jumps at phase boundaries that result in stress discontinuities, which in turn can cause cracking. The influence of the mechanical properties of the two phases on stress evolution, stress discontinuity, and strain energy are clarified.

50|$|This {{condition}} is sometimes termed the “hard” sulfation of the <b>battery</b> <b>electrode</b> REF. Hard sulfation increases the battery’s impedance (since the lead sulfate crystals tend to insulate the electrode from the electrolyte) and decreases its power, capacity and efficiency {{due to increased}} undesirable side reactions, some of which occur inside the negative plate due to charging taking place with low availability of lead sulfate (inside the plate body). One undesirable effect is the production of hydrogen inside the plate, further reducing {{the efficiency of the}} reaction. “Hard” sulfation is generally irreversible since the side reactions tend to dominate as more and more energy is pushed into the battery.|$|E
