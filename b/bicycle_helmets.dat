40|$|Introduction and Rationale: Bicycle riding {{is popular}} among the {{pediatric}} population, but with popularity comes {{a significant increase}} in morbidity and mortality. Cycling injuries occur in one-fifth of children aged 15 years and younger. Most life-threatening injuries among bicycle riders occur when the head is involved in bodily injury. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) related to bicycle accidents accounts for three-fourths of deaths. Despite the risk, many bicycle riders go without wearing helmets, largely due to lack of ownership. Purpose and Objective: The purpose of this Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) project was to develop and implement a pilot <b>bicycle</b> <b>helmet</b> program for a pediatric population, ages 5 - 13, from a pediatric emergency department (PED) perspective. The project objective was to increase <b>bicycle</b> <b>helmet</b> use among participants' children by providing the child with a free <b>bicycle</b> <b>helmet,</b> and also providing the parent with education specifically related to the importance of <b>bicycle</b> <b>helmet</b> safety. The project was driven through the Health Belief Model, and utilized the Teachable Moment of a PED encounter to influence risk-reducing behavior. Methods: This DNP project utilized a quasi-experimental, one group, pre- and post-test design. Participants were recruited from an urban PED, and identified at triage as being involved in a bicycle accident. Eligible children were fitted for a free <b>bicycle</b> <b>helmet,</b> and the parent was provided with an educational session coupled with a handout for home. A one-month follow-up phone call was conducted to assess <b>bicycle</b> <b>helmet</b> use and education retainment following the intervention. Results: All participants reported an increase in <b>bicycle</b> <b>helmet</b> use by their children. This study was able to show statistical significance related to <b>bicycle</b> <b>helmet</b> use, thus the null hypothesis was fairly confidently rejected. However, there were only five participants in this study, which makes generalization of results to a larger population difficult. Conclusions: This study showed that a <b>bicycle</b> <b>helmet</b> program is feasible in a PED, and could increase <b>bicycle</b> <b>helmet</b> use in a pediatric population. A DNP is an excellent candidate to run such a program as it focuses on positively impacting injury-prevention and dissemination of good practice for a larger community...|$|R

The checkerboard colors for patrolmen, detectives, dogs and horses are blue and white; the colors for sergeants and higher ranks are blue and gold. Service caps, the campaign hats of the mounted unit, <b>bicycle</b> <b>helmets,</b> knit caps, dog collars, and horse browbands all bear the Sillitoe tartan; the edge of the ball caps' bills show a narrow, flattened Silitoe tartan.

500|$|Prevention of PTE {{involves}} preventing brain {{trauma in}} general; protective measures include <b>bicycle</b> <b>helmets</b> and child safety seats. [...] No specific treatment exists {{to prevent the}} development of epilepsy after TBI occurs. In the past, antiepileptic drugs were used {{with the intent of}} preventing the development of PTE. However, while antiepileptic drugs can prevent early PTS, clinical studies have failed to show that prophylactic use of antiepileptic drugs prevents the development of PTE. Why antiepileptic drugs in clinical trials have failed to stop PTE from developing is not clear, but several explanations have been offered. [...] The drugs may simply not be capable of preventing epilepsy, or the drug trials may have been set up in a way that did not allow a benefit of the drugs to be found (e.g. drugs may have been given too late or in inadequate doses). [...] Animal studies have similarly failed to show much protective effect of the most commonly used seizure medications in PTE trials, such as phenytoin and carbamazepine. [...] Antiepileptic drugs are recommended to prevent late seizures only for people in whom PTE has already been diagnosed, not as a preventative measure. [...] On the basis of the aforementioned studies, no treatment is widely accepted to prevent the development of epilepsy. However, it has been proposed that a narrow window of about one hour after TBI may exist during which administration of antiepileptics could prevent epileptogenesis (the development of epilepsy).|$|E

All helmets and J headform were scanned using Flexscan 3 D scanning equipment. Post-scan processing jobs of scanned geometry models such as helmet liner, shell and headform were conducted in Geomagic Studio 12.

A drop impact simulation was developed based on the density and impact speed data obtained from the physical test. Inner liner of <b>bicycle</b> <b>helmet,</b> made from Expanded Polystyrene (EPS), was modeled using crushable foam properties, while headform and anvil were modeled as rigid bodies.
