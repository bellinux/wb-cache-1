When Marge leaves, Bart finds plutonium in Homer's toolbox and hammers {{it into the}} remote's <b>battery</b> <b>slot.</b> When they use the remote, the kids enter the world of Itchy and Scratchy. Bart and Lisa are soon hunted by Itchy and Scratchy. Back in the Simpson house, Homer enters {{the living room and}} watches the show. Oblivious to what he sees, Homer decides to change the channel, and Bart, Lisa, Itchy, and Scratchy wind up on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee.

5000|$|... 1994 saw the {{introduction}} of the Motorola 68LC040-based PowerBook 500 series, code-named Blackbird. These models of PowerBooks were much sleeker and faster than the 100 series, which they replaced as the mid and high-end models. The 500 series featured DSTN (520) or active-matrix LCD displays (540 and 550), stereo speakers, and was the first computer to use a trackpad [...] (although a similar technology had been included on the pioneering Gavilan SC 11 years earlier); it was also the first portable computer to offer built-in Ethernet networking. The PowerBook 500 series was the mainstay of the product line until the PowerBook 5300. The 500 series was the first PowerBook to feature PCMCIA slots, although this was an optional feature which required the user to sacrifice one of the two available <b>battery</b> <b>slots</b> to house the PCMCIA expansion cage.|$|R

40|$|Slot {{coating process}} is mainly {{applied for the}} {{manufacture}} of flat panel displays and long life <b>batteries.</b> In <b>slot</b> coating process, as in other coating process, producing very thin uniform coating film is a difficult task because of the occurrence of unexpected disturbances that causes defects during coating operations. The sensitivity of slot coating flow has been experimentally and theoretically analyzed in this study using frequency response method. Sinusoidal variations of the wet film thickness with respect to sinusoidal disturbances at flow rate, web speed, coating gap, bead pressure, etc. have been estimated from both 1 D and 2 D models. Also, sensitivity results of the wet film thickness and upstream meniscus position on sinusoidal web speed condition have been obtained from slot coating experiments and compared with those by simulations...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a power performance tradeoff methodology for portable reconfigurable computing systems. There are two basic techniques which we employ to vary the power and performance of the application: frequency change and core change. For this methodology we implement a given algorithm with varying power performance levels: we call these implementations, Cores. Each core is characterized {{in terms of its}} power and performance levels and this information is included as a header in each core. We identify three scenarios with different goals: maximization of total work done, battery life time extension and weighted combination of work done and battery lifetime. We divide the total energy available in the <b>battery</b> into fixed <b>slots</b> which we call reconfiguration slots. Integer Linear Program formulations are used to find the best constraint-satisfying sequence of cores offline. Each chosen core in the sequence is allowed to execute until its energy quantum is exhausted. We tested this methodology with three example designs: FFT, DCT and a Parallel Multiplier...|$|R
