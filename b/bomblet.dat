5|$|The {{success and}} economy of {{multiple}} rocket launchers (MRL) have {{led them to}} continue to be developed. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union fielded several models of Katyusha-like MRL, notably the BM-21 launchers somewhat inspired by the earlier weapon, and the larger BM-27. Advances in artillery munitions have been applied to some Katyusha-type multiple launch rocket systems, including <b>bomblet</b> submunitions, remotely deployed land mines, and chemical warheads.|$|E
25|$|The M125 <b>bomblet</b> was a sub-munition of the M34 cluster bomb, {{which was}} first brought into regular service by the United States Army in 1954. In {{development}} the M125 {{was known as}} the E54R6 <b>bomblet</b> (shortened to E54). The M34 and its payload of M125s was the first air-delivered nerve agent weapon in the U.S. chemical arsenal. Later, the Chemical Corps developed chemical-biological warheads for multiple missile systems including, Matador, Rascal, Snark, and Navaho missiles. These warheads incorporated the M125 <b>bomblet</b> and the M114 <b>bomblet.</b> Over 21,000 of the M125 containing M34 bombs were destroyed at Rocky Mountain Arsenal in 1976.|$|E
25|$|The M34 was {{designed}} to hold 76 M125 bomblets, arranged in four groups of 19. Each <b>bomblet</b> held 2.6 pounds of the nerve agent sarin, and 8.8 ounces of the explosive tetryl. The ten pound cylindrical M125 <b>bomblet</b> also held an opening delay, fuze and parachute, {{as well as a}} burster, which contained the explosive. A M34 cluster bomb, fully loaded with M125 bomblets, had an agent weight to weapon weight ratio of 17 percent; the M34 and M125 were not the best delivery system. Eventually, cylindrical chemical bomblets, such as the M125, were supplanted by spherical models because they could obtain a greater coverage area.|$|E
50|$|Dry-type {{biologicals}} resemble talcum powder, {{and can be}} disseminated as aerosols using gas expulsion devices {{instead of}} a burster or complex sprayer. The Chemical Corps developed Flettner rotor <b>bomblets</b> and later triangular <b>bomblets</b> for wider coverage due to improved glide angles over Magnus-lift spherical <b>bomblets.</b> Weapons of this type were in advanced development {{by the time the}} program ended.|$|R
50|$|The {{other serious}} problem, also common to {{explosive}} weapons is unexploded ordnance (UXO) of cluster <b>bomblets</b> left behind after a strike. These <b>bomblets</b> may be duds {{or in some}} cases the weapons are designed to detonate at a later stage. In both cases, the surviving <b>bomblets</b> are live and can explode when handled, making them a serious threat to civilians and military personnel entering the area. In effect, the UXOs can function like land mines.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] M43 BZ {{cluster bomb}} had a [...] {{diameter}} and a [...] length. This cluster bomb {{was designed to}} hold three stacks of 19 M138 <b>bomblets.</b> The <b>bomblets</b> each held about [...] of the incapacitating agent BZ, also known as 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate.|$|R
25|$|The M125 <b>bomblet</b> was a U.S. {{chemical}} sub-munition {{designed to}} deliver the nerve agent sarin. It was brought into service in 1954 with the M34 cluster bomb {{as part of the}} first U.S. air-delivered nerve agent weapon.|$|E
25|$|During World War II the United States and Canada {{undertook}} studying ricin in cluster bombs. Though {{there were}} plans for mass production and several field trials with different <b>bomblet</b> concepts, the end conclusion {{was that it}} was no more economical than using phosgene. This conclusion was based on comparison of the final weapons, rather than ricin's toxicity (LCt50 ~40mg·min/m3). Ricin was given the military symbol W or later WA. Interest in it continued for a short period after World War II, but soon subsided when the U.S. Army Chemical Corps began a program to weaponize sarin.|$|E

50|$|Because cluster bombs release {{many small}} <b>bomblets</b> {{over a wide}} area, they pose risks to civilians both during attacks and afterwards. Unexploded <b>bomblets</b> can kill or maim civilians and/or {{unintended}} targets long after a conflict has ended, and are costly to locate and remove.|$|R
50|$|While all {{weapons are}} dangerous, cluster bombs pose a {{particular}} threat to civilians for two reasons: {{they have a}} wide area of effect, and they have consistently left behind {{a large number of}} unexploded <b>bomblets.</b> The unexploded <b>bomblets</b> can remain dangerous for decades after the end of a conflict.|$|R

2500|$|Throughout {{four days}} of combat, {{including}} the initial breach of Iraqi lines and the battles of Al Busayyah and Medina Ridge, the unit conducted one of the US Army's largest artillery bombardments {{since the second world}} war. All totaled, 4-27 FA fired 588 M26 [...] "cluster bomb" [...] rockets into Iraqi forces and inflicted several thousand casualties in advance of 1st AD's armored assault. To put the scale of this bombardment in perspective, each rocket contained 644 DPICM <b>bomblet</b> submunitions, for a total of 378,672 warheads. Which is why US service members nickname these barrages [...] "steel rain." [...] While in practice many targets received multiple salvos and the submunitions had a 2–5% dud rate, if each rocket had been spaced out to maximize submunition blast radius, then the barrage would have theoretically [...] "sanitized" [...] a target area up to 49 square kilometers.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1965, Project Black Spot was a {{test program}} {{designed}} to give the Air Force a self-contained night attack capability to seek out and destroy targets along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. After the program {{was approved by the}} Department of Defense in early 1966, E-Systems of Greenville, Texas modified two C-123K Providers which were redesignated NC-123Ks, but were often referred to as AC-123Ks. The aircraft were equipped with a long, 57.75inch nose fairing that housed an X-band forward-looking radar. Below and aft of the extended radome was a turret with Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR), Low-Level Light Television (LLLTV), and a laser range-finder/illuminator. Also, a low-level Doppler navigation radar and weapons release computer were installed. Two rectangular aluminum weapons dispensers (for CBU bomblets) were stacked within the fuselage. Each container housed 12 cells, each cell containing three Cluster Bomb Units (CBUs). Depending on the type of CBU installed, the containers had a capacity of between 2,664 and 6,372 one pound bomblets. The bomblets were released through 12 openings in the cargo floor that aligned with the cells in the weapons dispenser. The lower fuselage contained 12 inward opening doors that aligned with the openings in the cargo floor, forming a chute. <b>Bomblet</b> release was controlled by a weapons panel in the forward section of the fuselage. In the event of an emergency, the entire load could be jettisoned manually. The first aircraft, 54–691, was delivered to Eglin AFB in August 1967 and the second, 54–698, incorporating an AN/ASD-5 Black Crow direction finder set (engine ignition sensor), was delivered in February 1968. The two aircraft were then deployed, first the Republic of Korea, to be evaluated against North Korean high-speed patrol boats used to insert agents, 19 August – 23 October 1968; and then to South Vietnam with operations beginning 15 November 1968. Despite their success, with 70% of all missions completed and in-commission rate of 84%, there were no follow-on NC-123Ks modified. [...] The two aircraft were transferred to the 16th Special Operations Squadron at Udon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, where they continued to serve from late 1969 to June 1970. Both airframes were then returned to standard C-123K configuration to serve again as airlifters.|$|E

50|$|The BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb is the {{submunition}} used {{in several}} cluster bomb type weapon systems. When the <b>bomblets</b> fall, they {{separate from the}} main bomb and independently free fall to the ground. They contain an inflatable bag (ballute) {{on the top of}} them, which slows them down and spreads them out. Once the <b>bomblets</b> reach a force of 6 Gs they arm themselves. As the <b>bomblets</b> fall, they are also spinning. Arming takes about 2.6 seconds. They have a combined shaped charge, fragmentation and incendiary effect on the target. It is very effective against and mainly used for anti-personnel, anti-materiel, and anti-armor.|$|R
50|$|The M143 <b>bomblet</b> was a {{biological}} cluster bomb sub-munition {{developed by the}} United States during the 1960s. The spherical <b>bomblet</b> was the biological version of the Sarin-filled M139 chemical <b>bomblet.</b>|$|E
50|$|The M139 <b>bomblet</b> was a U.S. sub-munition {{designed}} for use in warheads as a chemical cluster bomb. Each <b>bomblet</b> held 1.3 lb of sarin nerve agent.|$|E
50|$|The M134 <b>bomblet,</b> {{developed}} as the E130, or E130R1 <b>bomblet,</b> began {{development in the}} early 1950s. While the weapon was not yet battle-ready, or ready for mass-production, in 1960, work on the <b>bomblet</b> dated back to at least 1953. By 1964 the <b>bomblet</b> design had been improved and the smaller M139 was adapted for use with the rocket warheads utilized by the M134. Thus, the M134 was never mass-produced; {{by the time the}} missile warhead and the M134 were ready for production they had been supplanted.|$|E

5000|$|The E120 was a spherical <b>bomblet</b> with a {{diameter}} of 11.4 centimeters. It was designed to hold 0.1 kilograms of liquid biological agent. Much like the M139 <b>bomblet,</b> the E120 had exterior [...] "vanes". However, the vanes' function on the E120 was to cause the <b>bomblet</b> to rotate as it fell, thus shattering and rolling around upon impact while spraying the agent from a nozzle.|$|E

50|$|The M138 <b>bomblet</b> was a sub-munition of the U.S. {{chemical}} weapon, the M43 BZ cluster bomb. The <b>bomblet</b> contained BZ, an {{incapacitating agent}} and was developed with the M43 in 1962. The M138s, {{along with all}} other U.S. BZ weapons were destroyed during the 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|The M138 <b>bomblet</b> had {{the largest}} {{continuous}} diameter of any chemical <b>bomblet</b> in the U.S. arsenal, a full 72 millimeters (mm). The M138 also possessed the thickest steel walls of U.S. bomblets, about 3 mm. The M43 cluster bomb was designed to hold 57 M138s, arranged in three stacks of 19 bomblets. Each <b>bomblet</b> held about 6 ounces of the incapacitating agent BZ, also known as 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate. The bomblets themselves were composed of M7 canisters which held a 50/50 mixture of pyrotechnic and agent (pyromix).|$|E
