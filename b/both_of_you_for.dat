40|$|This study {{examined}} eighth grade predictor variables for predictive power in identifying students at-risk for {{dropping out of}} high school in a northwest Georgia school district. This study involved 340 participants from the 2005 / 2006 ninth grade class in the selected school district. This quantitative study employed correlation analyses to determine the linear relationship between dropping {{out of high school}} and the predictor variables. Logistic regression analysis determined which set of predictor variables best predicted the student outcome. The analysis indicated that years retained, discipline referrals, socioeconomic status, final math grade, CRCT math score, and absences were the most significant predictors of high school end status (dropout or graduate). A regression model using the six variables was able to correctly classify 91. 5 % of the cases. ii DEDICATION This dissertation is dedicated to my two precious daughters, Sydney and Allie.
