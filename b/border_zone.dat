5|$|Ahmad ibn Tulun, a Turkish soldier, {{had managed}} to become {{governor}} of Egypt in 868. By using the country's immense wealth to raise an army of his own, and exploiting the instability of the central Abbasid government, over the next years he became de facto autonomous, although he continued to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Abbasid caliph—for most of his reign the powerless al-Mu'tamid—and to forward some tax revenue to the central government. Ibn Tulun's power made him a major rival to the real power behind the Abbasid throne, al-Mu'tamid's brother and regent al-Muwaffaq. The latter tried in 877 to wrest Egypt from Ibn Tulun, but the attempt failed spectacularly, and {{in the following year}} Ibn Tulun extended his area of control over Syria up to the <b>border</b> <b>zone</b> with the Byzantine Empire in the north and up to Raqqa in the western Jazira in the east, immediately adjacent to the Abbasid metropolitan province of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|George II's {{relationship}} with his son and heir apparent, Frederick, Prince of Wales, worsened during the 1730s. Frederick {{had been left behind}} in Germany when his parents came to England, and they had not met for 14 years. In 1728, he was brought to England, and swiftly became a figurehead of the political opposition. When George visited Hanover in the summers of 1729, 1732 and 1735, he left his wife to chair the regency council in Britain rather than his son. Meanwhile, rivalry between George II and his brother-in-law and first cousin Frederick William I of Prussia led to tension along the Prussian–Hanoverian border, which eventually culminated in the mobilization of troops in the <b>border</b> <b>zone</b> and suggestions of a duel between the two kings. Negotiations for a marriage between the Prince of Wales and Frederick William's daughter Wilhelmine dragged on for years but neither side would make the concessions demanded by the other, and the idea was shelved. Instead, the prince married Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha in April 1736.|$|E

The Byzantines secured great financial and territorial advantages from the truce, which they extended further by exploiting the Umayyad government's involvement in the Second Muslim Civil War (680–692). However, by 692 the Umayyads were clearly emerging as the victors in the conflict, and Abd al-Malik consciously {{began a series of}} provocations to bring about a resumption of warfare. Justinian, confident in his own strength based on his previous successes, responded in kind. Finally, the Umayyads claimed that the Byzantines had broken the treaty and invaded Byzantine territory, defeating the imperial army at the Battle of Sebastopolis in 693. In its aftermath, the Arabs quickly regained control over Armenia and resumed their attacks into the <b>border</b> <b>zone</b> of eastern Asia Minor, that would culminate in the second attempt to conquer Constantinople in 716–718. Furthermore, Justinian was deposed in 695, beginning a twenty-year period of internal instability that almost brought the Byzantine state to its knees.|$|E

40|$|Background-In depolarized {{myocardial}} infarct epicardial <b>border</b> <b>zones,</b> the cardiac sodium channel is largely inactivated, contributing to slow conduction and reentry. We {{have demonstrated that}} adenoviral delivery of the skeletal muscle Na+ channel (SkM 1) to epicardial <b>border</b> <b>zones</b> normalizes conduction and reduces induction of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. We now studied the impact of canine mesenchymal stem cells (cMSCs) in delivering SkM 1. Methods and Results-cMSCs were isolated and transfected with SkM 1. Coculture experiments showed cMSC/SkM 1 but not cMSC alone and maintained fast conduction at depolarized potentials. We studied 3 groups in the canine 7 d infarct: sham, cMSC, and cMSC/SkM 1. In vivo epicardial <b>border</b> <b>zones</b> electrograms were broad and fragmented in sham, narrower in cMSCs, and narrow and unfragmented in cMSC/SkM 1 (P 0. 05). Conclusion-cMSCs provide efficient delivery of SkM 1 current. The interventions performed (cMSCs or cMSC/SkM 1) were neither antiarrhythmic nor proarrhythmic. Comparing outcomes with cMSC/SkM 1 and viral gene delivery highlights the criticality of the delivery platform to SkM 1 antiarrhythmic efficacy.

A number of factors led to this lack of organisation. For one, the Soviet evacuation plans were thrown together fairly hurriedly, and a lot of the logistical planning was done on the fly as the German advance was already sweeping through the Soviet <b>border</b> <b>zone.</b> The German invasion also hampered the effectiveness of the Soviet response by shattering their communications in the war's early stages; many Soviet leaders were unable to gather reliable information about the positions of German forces until it was too late to effect an orderly evacuation.|$|E
