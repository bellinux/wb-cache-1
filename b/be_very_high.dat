5|$|An Italian volcanological mission {{analyzed}} gas {{samples from}} fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and proved {{them to be}} a mixture {{of carbon dioxide and}} sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment. The mission's report, delivered on October 22, 1985, judged the risk of lahars to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>high.</b> The report proposed various simple preparedness techniques to local authorities.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth's {{climate is}} a {{transitional}} humid continental/cold humid subtropical/marine type, {{which is the}} predominant climate for Massachusetts. Due to its location on the Atlantic Ocean, humidity levels can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> year-round. Plymouth's coastal location causes it to experience warmer temperatures than many inland locations in New England. Summers are typically hot and humid, while winters are cold, windy and often snowy.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{patterns}} {{suggest that}} green-head ant workers mate with unrelated males from distant colonies. The relatedness among workers {{is also very}} low, {{and there is a}} high proportion of gamergate ants. If the gamergates are all unrelated, the number of gamergates living in a nest can reach as many as nine; all of these gamergates contribute to the reproduction of young. The average number of gamergates can still <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> if they are related and get a larger share in reproduction. Most of the time, however, gamergates are generally unrelated, and it is uncommon for them to have a degree of relatedness. In many colonies, workers and gamergates police young females, which prevents them from reproducing.|$|E

5|$|The first {{complete}} DNA {{sequence of}} an E. coli genome (laboratory strain K-12 derivative MG1655) {{was published in}} 1997. It {{was found to be}} a circular DNA molecule 4.6 million base pairs in length, containing 4288 annotated protein-coding genes (organized into 2584 operons), seven ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operons, and 86 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. Despite having been the subject of intensive genetic analysis for about 40 years, a large number of these genes were previously unknown. The coding density was found to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>high,</b> with a mean distance between genes of only 118 base pairs. The genome was observed to contain a significant number of transposable genetic elements, repeat elements, cryptic prophages, and bacteriophage remnants.|$|E

25|$|Strictly, Cushing's {{syndrome}} {{refers to}} excess cortisol of any etiology (as syndrome means {{a group of}} symptoms). One {{of the causes of}} Cushing's syndrome is a cortisol-secreting adenoma in the cortex of the adrenal gland (primary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism). The adenoma causes cortisol levels in the blood to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>high,</b> and negative feedback on the pituitary from the high cortisol levels causes ACTH levels to be very low.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{rocket engine}} {{can handle a}} {{significant}} fraction of its own mass in propellant each second, with the propellant leaving the nozzle at several kilometres per second. This means that the thrust-to-weight ratio of a rocket engine, and often the entire vehicle can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>high,</b> in extreme cases over 100. This compares with other jet propulsion engines that can exceed 5 {{for some of the}} better engines.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{treatment}} for tick paralysis is the careful administration of anti-tick serum. The effectiveness of anti-tick serum is most dependent on how early it is administered. Early treatment {{offers the best}} chance of full recovery. Unlike snake bite, tick envenoming has a relatively slow onset. Despite this slow onset the fatality rate can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> (even higher than snake bite) if antiserum is not given sufficiently early, before the signs are advanced.|$|E

The formation can be selectively stimulated and the well can be deepened. This selection is adaptable to other completion configurations and logs {{are available to}} assist casing decisions. Much better primary casing. It can however cause damage to zones and needs good log interpretation. The perforating cost can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>high.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} waste-waters {{associated with}} mines and quarries are slurries of rock particles in water. These arise from rainfall washing exposed surfaces and haul roads {{and also from}} rock washing and grading processes. Volumes of water can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>high,</b> especially rainfall related arisings on large sites. Some specialized separation operations, such as coal washing to separate coal from native rock using density gradients, can produce wastewater contaminated by fine particulate haematite and surfactants. Oils and hydraulic oils are also common contaminants.|$|E
25|$|Fire {{may cause}} changes in soil {{nutrients}} {{through a variety}} of mechanisms, including oxidation, volatilization, erosion, and leaching by water. Temperatures must <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>high,</b> however, to cause a significant loss of nutrients, which are often replaced by organic matter left behind in the fire. Also, the minerals which were formerly part of slowly decaying plant matter become more soluble and available in the ash. Charcoal is able to counteract some nutrient and water loss because of its absorptive properties.|$|E

25|$|Enough {{is known}} about Brazilian fungi to say with {{confidence}} {{that the number of}} native species must <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>high</b> and very diverse: in work almost entirely limited to the state of Pernambuco, during the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, more than 3300 species were observed by a single group of mycologists Given that current best estimates suggest only about 7% of the world's true diversity of fungal species has so far been discovered, with most of the known species having been described from temperate regions, the number of fungal species occurring in Brazil is likely to be far higher.|$|E
25|$|Caesium {{chloride}} {{composed of}} radioisotopes such as 137CsCl and 131CsCl, {{is used in}} nuclear medicine, including treatment of cancer (brachytherapy) and diagnosis of myocardial infarction. In the production of radioactive sources, it is normal to choose a chemical form of the radioisotope which would not be readily dispersed in the environment {{in the event of}} an accident. For instance, radiothermal generators (RTGs) often use strontium titanate, which is insoluble in water. For teletherapy sources, however, the radioactive density (Ci in a given volume) needs to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>high,</b> which is not possible with known insoluble caesium compounds. A thimble-shaped container of radioactive caesium chloride provides the active source.|$|E
25|$|This {{valuation}} mode {{is typically}} used to value regulated storage, for instance storage operated by interstate pipeline companies. These companies are regulated by FERC. This pricing method allows the developers to recover their cost and an agreed upon return on investment. The regulatory body {{requires that the}} rates and tariffs are maintained and publicly published. The services provided by these companies include firm and interruptible storage as well as no-notice storage services. Usually, cost of service pricing is used for depleted reservoir facilities. If {{it is used to}} price, say salt cavern formations, the cost would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>high,</b> due to the high cost of development of such facilities.|$|E
