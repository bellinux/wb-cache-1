40|$|Precision {{machining}} {{has received}} more and more industry-wide attention as dimensional accuracy becomes a significant measure of quality in a product. The key in achieving today's quality requirement is, therefore, precision of a machine tool. Since {{the invention of the}} first CNC machine tool in the 1960 s, machine tool research has entered an almost stagnant stage. There are numerous reasons for the slow progress, and the lack of system- wide studies of the machine tool performance is one of them. The research presented in this thesis focuses on improving machining accuracy using a systems engineering approach. A conventional lathe during machining is taken under consideration as a machining system. The <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> is identified as a critical component in the machining system to achieve the defined machining accuracy. Smart material made actuators are used to design a new <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> structure that is capable of carrying out an active vibration control during machining. In this thesis research, the fabrication of the designed <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> is completed. Results obtained from the initial tests strongly demonstrate its capability to attenuate tool vibration during machining in an active and intelligent way. Thus, the smart <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> system fulfills the design objective of achieving microscopic level machining precision on a low-cost conventional machine tool platform. Suggestions on the actuator specifications are made for further improvement on vibration compensation...|$|R
40|$|In {{machining}} industries, achieving better {{surface finish}} of a product is very essential.

In this work, three cutting speeds, three feed rates and three depth of cuts were used in boring operation. During the boring operation, the accelerometer was fixed on the <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> to record the vibration signal. The surface roughness was measured using perthometer.

40|$|Tool {{vibration}} is {{a well-known}} fact in causing poor surface finish, accelerated tool wear, and unstable machining operations. Due to the availability of active or "smart" materials, researchers in the machine tool industry are now focusing on applying active control to attenuate tool vibration during machining. In this thesis research, efforts are dedicated to investigating the mechanical and electrical behavior of a designed <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> structure in which lead-magnesium-niobate (PMN) actuators are used as built-in devices for vibration control. Research is focused on using finite element method (FEM) to identify the dynamic characteristics of the <b>tool</b> <b>post,</b> establishing an experimental testbed environment for experimental verifications, and implementing the <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> in a shop floor machining environment to test its performance, both mechanically and electronically. Results obtained from this investigation has justified the <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> design for its effectiveness in carrying out vibration compensation during machining. A 10 to 20 percent of reduction has been observed with the PMN actuators in action. Significant findings of this research include 2 to 3 mm floating of the dynamic equilibrium position of the tool tip during the compensation, {{and the effect of}} interplay between actuator-driving frequency and workpiece rotation on in-process compensation. Control of the coupling coefficient deserves special, attention for maintaining an acceptable efficiency of conversion from electrical energy to mechanical energy. Knowledge gained from this study has provided guidelines not only for off- line optimization, but also for controller designs when PMN actuators are applied. <P...|$|R

40|$|Foragers occupying Dzombo Shelter, eastern Botswana, and {{producing}} a Later Stone Age technology {{came into contact}} with incoming Iron Age food-producers at approximately AD 350. From the onset of their interactions the Later Stone Age record began to change. One such change was in stone tool preference; over much of southern Africa scraper frequencies increased whereas <b>backed</b> <b>tools</b> declined. However, between c. AD 900 and 1200 at Dzombo, <b>backed</b> <b>tools</b> inexplicably dominate the formal tool assemblage. This paper seeks to understand the role of <b>backed</b> <b>tools</b> at Dzombo from before the arrival of farmers until the establishment of the Mapungubwe state, c. AD 1220, in order to explain shifts in use and preference patterns. By performing a macro-fracture analysis it was possible to demonstrate an increased occurrence of fractures consistent with impact-related damage between approximately AD 350 and 1200, and it is suggested here that during this time hunting activities were intensified. The factors possibly driving this intensification are discussed and could relate to forager-farmer interactions or a shift in the site’s function. As is shown, the former is more likely. The macro-analysis of <b>backed</b> <b>tools</b> provides greater clarity when viewing Dzombo’s archaeological sequence and to some extent confirms earlier suggestions that in order to augment growing mercantile opportunities spurred on by the arrival of farmers, forager hunting activities increased...|$|R

40|$|Unlike other Gravettian {{contexts}} in Southern Iberian Peninsula, the Early Gravettian lithic assemblage from the archaeological site of Vale Boi (SW Portugal) {{is characterized by}} the absence of typical backed points, such as Gravettian and Microgravette points. Instead, backed technology is present in the unusual form of bipointed double backed bladelet s. The presence of these <b>backed</b> <b>tools</b> in other Gravettian contexts is very rare, and their strong presence in the lithic assemblages from Vale Boi has no parallel in Southern Iberia, representing a novelty for the Gravettian record in the region. Given their morphology, this type of <b>backed</b> <b>tool</b> has been associated, in other industries, with perforation activities. In this paper, however, we present the results on technological, macro and micro-wear analyses showing the presence of fatigue traces (diagnostic impact fractures and hafting traces) commonly associated to projectile tips.
