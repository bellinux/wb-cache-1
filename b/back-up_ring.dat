50|$|Back-up {{rings are}} used in Polyethylene (PE) pipe connections, such as HDPE pipes, where they are {{connected}} to steel pipe or pipe fittings. The <b>back-up</b> <b>ring</b> is matched to the steel pipe flange specification and is placed behind the HDPE flange adapter - a end piece on the HDPE pipe that looks much like a steel flange {{at the end of}} the HDPE pipe. As the flange adapter does not have much structural strength, the <b>back-up</b> <b>ring</b> supports and compresses the HDPE flange adapter against the steel flange and creates an effective connection between the two piping materials.|$|E
50|$|A <b>back-up</b> <b>ring</b> is a rigid {{ring that}} holds an {{elastomeric}} seal or plastic (such as Polyethylene) connection to its designed shape {{and in its}} correct place. Back up rings are commonly used with O-rings, lip seals, and as reciprocating shaft seals. They are also used for piping connections joining two different materials - typically one flexible and one rigid.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} both tests {{show that the}} new {{structure}} of the packer rubber (single rubber barrel with expanding <b>back-up</b> <b>rings)</b> is reasonable and can work well under high temperature (170  °C) and high pressure (70  MPa) after setting. AFLAS rubber has greater resistance to high pressure and high temperature than HNBR.|$|R
30|$|During {{hydraulic}} fracturing operations of low-permeability reservoirs, packers {{are the key}} component to ensure the success of multistage fracturing. Packers enable sections of the wellbore to be sealed off and separately fractured by hydraulic pressure, one at a time, while {{the remainder of the}} wellbore is not affected. However, reliable sealing properties of the packer rubber are required to meet the high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) conditions of reservoirs (such as 70  MPa and 170  °C). In this study, the structures of the packer rubber with two different materials are optimized numerically by ABAQUS and validated by experiments. The optimization process starts from the packer rubber with a conventional structure, and then, the weakest spots are identified by ABAQUS and improved by slightly varying its structure. This process is iterative, and the final optimized structure of a single rubber barrel with expanding <b>back-up</b> <b>rings</b> is achieved. For the structure of three rubber barrels with metallic protective covers, both HNBR and AFLAS fail under HPHT conditions. For the final optimized structure, the packer rubber made of AFLAS can work better under HPHT than that made of HNBR which ruptures after setting. The results show that the optimized structure of a single rubber barrel with expanding <b>back-up</b> <b>rings</b> and the material AFLAS are a good combination for the packer rubber playing an excellent sealing performance in multistage fracturing in horizontal wells.|$|R
50|$|In vacuum applications, the {{permeability}} of {{the material}} makes point contacts quite useless. Instead, higher mounting forces are used and the ring fills the whole groove. Also, round <b>back-up</b> <b>rings</b> are used to save the ring from excessive deformation Because the ring feels the ambient pressure and the partial pressure of gases only at the seal, their gradients will be steep near the seal and shallow in the bulk (opposite to the gradient of the contact stress See: Vacuum flange#KF.2FQF. High-vacuum systems below 10−9 Torr use copper or nickel O-rings. Also, vacuum systems {{that have to be}} immersed in liquid nitrogen use indium O-rings, because rubber becomes hard and brittle at low temperatures.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe life of Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) O-ring seal having shore {{hardness}} of A 70 and A 90 under shock loading conditions was investigated by {{a specially designed}} pneumo-hydraulic shock test rig. Shock tests {{have been carried out}} on bare seals, seal with conventional polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) back-up rings and seal with newly developed carbon composite back-up rings to study its behaviour under different operating conditions until failure. Experiments were conducted by varying annular gap ranging from 0. 3 to 0. 5 [*]mm, oil temperature from 30 [*]°C to 70 [*]°C and rate of pressure rise from 600 to 2400 [*]MPa/s. Significant enhancement in seal life was observed with carbon composite <b>back-up</b> <b>ring</b> at reduced annular clearances compared to seal life with conventional PTFE <b>back-up</b> <b>ring</b> and without back-up rings...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Rectangular {{elastomeric}} seals used on {{reciprocating piston}} rods in high-pressure hydraulic actuators often suffer from extrusion damage at the low-pressure {{side of the}} actuators. The extrusion {{takes place at the}} narrow clearance between the rod and the actuator, where the seal develops a `nip’ under conditions of high sealed pressure and/or high friction with the rod, which is ampli®ed {{in the absence of a}} <b>back-up</b> <b>ring.</b> This form of strain can lead to permanent damage of the seal and impair the sealing performance of the system. This paper deals with the modelling of this kind of seal extrusion. Algebraic equations were developed to describe the shape and contact pressure of the extruded part of the seal with the rod. A study is presented about the effects of various operating parameters on the extent of seal extrusion in order to minimize the risks of damage. It was found that only the use of a <b>back-up</b> <b>ring</b> can adequately cancel the seal extrusion mechanism...|$|E
30|$|Two {{structure}} optimization schemes of the packer rubber are proposed. In each structure, both materials HNBR and AFLAS are tested. The {{results show}} that AFLAS rubber has greater resistance to high pressure (70  MPa) and high temperature (170  °C) than HNBR. In the structure of three rubber barrels with metallic protective covers, both HNBR and AFLAS are subjected to varying degrees of damage which cause poor sealing performances under high pressure and high temperature although the performance of AFLAS is better than that of HNBR. In {{the structure of a}} single rubber barrel with expanding <b>back-up</b> <b>rings,</b> the packer rubber made of HNBR is also ruptured but the packer rubber made of AFLAS works well under high temperature and high pressure after setting.|$|R
30|$|The {{structure}} of the single rubber barrel with expanding <b>back-up</b> <b>rings</b> and the material AFLAS are a good combination for the packer rubber providing an excellent sealing performance during the multistage fracturing of low-permeability reservoirs in offshore fields. In the new packer rubber, the middle single rubber barrel plays a major sealing role {{and there are two}} metal conical rings {{at both ends of the}} rubber barrel instead of the top and bottom rubber barrels in the construction of three rubber barrels to bear the thrust for setting. A dovetail groove is cut in the inner wall of the rubber barrel. There are a bearing flow ring made of metal and a seal ring (O-ring) in the groove to seal the space between the rubber barrel and the center pipe.|$|R
50|$|The {{season was}} marred {{not only by}} an injury to quarterback Len Dawson but also {{controversy}} surrounding Dawson and his purported involvement in a sports gambling <b>ring.</b> <b>Back-up</b> quarterback Mike Livingston and the Chiefs' stellar defense led the Chiefs back to the Super Bowl, this time, to win it all.|$|R

The rifle {{is designed for}} both target shooting and law enforcement use, and comes in two lengths, variant L (Long) and variant K (Short).

40|$|There is {{observed}} deviation of endurance in dynamic and static sealings in the hydrau-lic system {{of an airplane}} which is suspected {{to be caused by}} differences in material and quality between different manufacturers. In order to find out and verify these dif-ferences series of comparing tests were conducted on specifically made test equip-ment. The main goal of this Master’s Thesis was to perform the needed tests on the seals and to evaluate the test results. The test system consisted of a hydraulically driven test cylinder which was able to test both the dynamic and static seal. The test cylinder was designed {{in such a way that}} it could be used to test two sealing systems at the same time. The test was conducted in conditions that resembled real life usage. The main points were that pressure, tempera-ture and movement speed were the same as in the original application. Control logic was used to run the test cylinder continuously from one end to the other. During the test the force needed to move the cylinder was monitored. From this force the friction and the deviation of friction behavior in dynamic seal during the test were computed. Leakage was monitored both on the dynamic seal and on the static seal. Pressures, position and temperature were also used as survey measures. Speed of the test cylinder was calculated from position. The system allowed testing of two piston seals, two rod seals and two O-rings simultaneously. Both piston seal and rod seal were T-seals. T-seals consist of a T-shaped elastomer sealing element supported by <b>back-up</b> <b>rings</b> on both sides. The wearing of seals was determined by change of weight before and after the experiment. The possible effect of absorption of fluid on the mass and properties of the sealing was examined with separate tests. The properties of the seals between the two manufacturers differed in the present study and the seals of manufacturer 2 lasted wearing better than the seals of manufacturer 1. This result is based on the leakage during the test, weighting after the test and friction behavior during the test. Also visual observation of the seals supports this finding...|$|R
