25|$|Kierkegaard {{decided to}} step up to the Tree of the {{knowledge}} of good and evil for himself, replacing Adam, and make his choice in the presence of God, where no one was there to accuse or judge him but his Creator. This is what he had Abraham do in Fear and Trembling. This is how Kierkegaard thought learning about oneself takes place. Here is where the single individual learns about guilt and innocence. His book, The Concept of Anxiety, makes clear that Adam did have knowledge when he made his choice and that was the knowledge of freedom. The prohibition was there <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> freedom and Eve and Adam decided to use it.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the large}} amounts of money spent on the schemes, they were not {{particularly}} effective, because of the failure to provide an outfall at Marfleet. Ship owners continued to oppose such a plan until at least 1810, and there was an agricultural depression from 1815 to 1830. During this period, the port of Hull developed, with the opening of Humber Dock in 1809 and Junction Dock (later Princes Dock) in 1829. By the time the agricultural industry began to recover, the carrs were in a bad state, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> the Old Harbour at Hull. Holderness Drainage acted quickly, obtaining an Act of Parliament in 1832, which authorised the construction of a drain to Marfleet, where the outlet sluice (known locally as a clow) could be built at a lower level than previous outlets, thus providing a better gradient for the flow of the water. The old Main Drain was embanked where it crossed the carrs, and was used to carry runoff from the streams of Holderness to the Hull. The new lowland drain carried water from the carrs to Marfleet, passing under the upland drain in the Great Culvert. Where possible, old drains were made straighter, wider and deeper, and the meres in the Leven and Tickton area soon disappeared. By 1854, around one sixth of the land was still subject to occasional winter flooding, but most of the carrs were by then used for crops, rather than for pasture.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, {{columnist}} Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with an A-, and praised September's stumbling {{entrance into the}} lab as [...] "yet another rich and remarkable scene". Entertainment Weekly writer Jeff Jensen had a more negative opinion, and commented that the episode [...] "failed to make my dinger hum," [...] which he attributed to high expectations set by fellow staff writer and former Fringe reviewer Ken Tucker. Jensen continued, [...] "It was, to my eyes, 'just okay.' Certainly not the equal {{of the past two}} episodes. And not the strongest possible kicker to a strong second act for Fringes fourth season, which now takes a four-week snooze before rising anew on March 23 for the first of eight consecutive episodes– a sweep of story that might represent the very end of all things Fringe. Damn, I’m such a downer this week, aren’t I? Ah, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> this episode." [...] In January 2013, IGN ranked the episode as the fourth best episode of the series, explaining that [...] "when Season 4 needed a boost of excitement, this episode delivered it in a timely fashion. It had a thrilling pace and offered answers to some questions that have lingering since the series began." ...|$|E

500|$|U. S. Senate. His Republican primary {{opponent}} was George Aiken, {{the popular}} two-term Governor of Vermont. Although Flanders admired and liked Aiken, {{he felt that}} Aiken's [...] "liberal" [...] ideas would not help the nation’s economic recovery. [...] In 1990, one of Vermont’s major newspapers, The Rutland Herald described the 1940 Republican primary campaign as dirty and mean. Aiken’s side accused Flanders of selling arms to the Nazis, and Flanders’s side suggested that [...] "Aiken was unduly influenced by his administrative assistant, a pretty 24-year-old with a fondness for power." [...] In retrospect, Flanders {{felt that he had}} allowed his campaign advisers to make too many of the decisions. [...] For example, a campaign brochure showed the candidate wearing a three-piece suit and holding a piglet in his arms. Although he had grown up on a subsistence farm and had an active interest in Vermont agriculture—especially in the type of hog shown in the picture—this had the effect of making him appear to be a phony. The Rutland Herald observed that, “In Vermont in 1940, pigs were common to many households. <b>But</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> common sense. There were many people, most in fact, who did not want as their representative someone who would wear his best clothes if he intended to be handling pigs.” Aiken won by 7,000 votes, having spent $3,219.50 to Flanders’s $18,698.45. This campaign taught Flanders that “I had to be myself.” ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 20th century, {{commercial}} fishing was prevalent, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> {{the boom in}} manufacturing industry around the lake, and often rivers and streams were used as sewers to flush untreated sewage which {{ended up in the}} lake. Sometimes poorly constructed sanitary systems meant that when old mains broke, raw sewage would spill directly into the Cuyahoga and into the lake. A report in Time magazine in 1969 described the lake as a [...] "gigantic cesspool" [...] since only three of 62 beaches were rated [...] "completely safe for swimming".|$|E
2500|$|Continuing {{indications}} of Italy's subordinate nature to Germany arose during the Greco-Italian War, which was disastrous for the poorly-armed Italian Army. Mussolini had intended {{the war with}} Greece to prove to Germany that Italy was no minor power in the alliance, but a capable empire which could hold its own weight. Mussolini boasted to his government that he would even resign from being Italian if anyone found fighting the Greeks to be difficult. Within days of invading Greece, the Greek army pushed the Italian army back into Albania and humiliatingly put Italy on the defensive. Hitler and the German government were frustrated with Italy's failing campaigns, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> Mussolini. Mussolini in private angrily accused Italians on the battlefield of becoming [...] "overcome with a crisis of artistic sentimentalism and throwing in the towel".|$|E

2500|$|Another, {{completely}} different attempt to save [...] "absolute" [...] aether {{was made in}} the Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction hypothesis, which posited that everything was affected by travel through the aether. In this theory the reason the Michelson–Morley experiment [...] "failed" [...] was that the apparatus contracted in length in the direction of travel. That is, the light was being affected in the [...] "natural" [...] manner by its travel though the aether as predicted, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> the apparatus itself, cancelling out any difference when measured. FitzGerald had inferred this hypothesis from a paper by Oliver Heaviside. Without referral to an aether, this physical interpretation of relativistic effects was shared by Kennedy and Thorndike in 1932 as they concluded that the interferometer's arm contracts and also the frequency of its light source [...] "very nearly" [...] varies in the way required by relativity.|$|E
