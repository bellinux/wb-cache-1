5|$|The twelve-minute sketch {{was written}} by Michael O'Donoghue who {{wanted to create a}} scene that would {{showcase}} the acting talents of John Belushi. O'Donoghue had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> had initially persuaded producer Lorne Michaels to hire Belushi for the new Saturday Night Live program. O'Donoghue and Belushi recognized that the original Star Trek series itself was not a ratings success during its initial run, but had become much more successful during syndication. Belushi enjoyed the Star Trek series and wanted the part of Captain Kirk. He demonstrated his intense desire to get the role by trimming his sideburns to closely resemble Kirk's facial appearance in the original series. They worked together on the sketch for thirty-days and scheduled it for the final episode of the 1976 season of the show when it would be hosted by Elliott Gould.|$|E

Moreover, in real life, Kennedy was the superintendent of the entire force. In the film, he is depicted as a mere detective sergeant.|$|E
25|$|Her son John Handy Jr. (Jack) {{grew up in}} Oakland {{with his}} {{siblings}} at their paternal grandmother Roseanna Handel's home.

She said that Heney had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> threatened and ambushed Handy, that he had been tried for murder and acquitted only because he was the sole witness.|$|E
25|$|Dumbledore was {{haunted by}} his sad family history. In particular, he was riddled with guilt over the {{circumstances}} surrounding the death of his sister. He felt enormous remorse for his selfishness and was tortured {{for the rest of his}} life by the possibility that he might have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> cast the spell that killed his sister.

The series premiered on October 10, 2007, and during this episode Donald Trump revealed that Katie Blair had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> had turned in Conner for {{alcohol and drug abuse}} because she felt that Conner was trying to steal Blair's boyfriend Josh.|$|E
25|$|By both {{temperament}} and connections, Adler had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> brought in new {{business to the}} partnership, and following the rupture Sullivan received few large commissions after the Carson Pirie Scott Department Store. He went into a twenty-year-long financial and emotional decline, beset by a shortage of commissions, chronic financial problems, and alcoholism. He obtained a few commissions for small-town Midwestern banks (see below), wrote books, and in 1922 appeared as a critic of Raymond Hood's winning entry for the Tribune Tower competition. He died in a Chicago hotel room on April 14, 1924. He left a wife, Mary Azona Hattabaugh, from whom he was separated. A modest headstone marks his final resting spot in Graceland Cemetery in Chicago's Uptown and Lake View neighborhood. Later, a monument was erected in Sullivan's honor, {{a few feet from}} his headstone.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} match, Cibernético, Billy el Malo, Charly Manson and Escoria of Los Bizarros faced La Parka, Dark Ozz and Drago of El Inframundo, who teamed with newly {{inducted}} Hall of Famer Octagón. At {{the end of}} the brawl, masked Los Bizarros member Taboo appeared {{at the top of the}} entrance ramp holding La Parka's ten-year-old son, who revealed on the microphone that Taboo was his uncle and thus La Parka's brother, the luchador formerly known as Lasser Boy. Meanwhile, in the ring, Cibernético took advantage of the distraction, hit Parka with a Garra Cibernetica and pinned him for the win. After the match, Cibernético revealed that Taboo had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> had helped him invade Parka's home and provided him with the X-rays of his godson's broken leg back in January. Taboo ended the segment by declaring Los Bizarros his new family.|$|E

25|$|Caccini's {{character}} {{seems to}} have been less than perfectly honorable, as he was frequently motivated by envy and jealousy, not only in his professional life but for personal advancement with the Medici. On one occasion, he informed to the Grand Duke Francesco on two lovers in the Medici householdEleonora, the wife of Pietro de' Medici, who was having an illicit affair with Bernardino Antinoriand his informing led directly to Eleonora's murder by Pietro. His rivalry with both Emilio de' Cavalieri and Jacopo Peri {{seems to have}} been intense: he may have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> arranged for Cavalieri to be removed from his post as director of festivities for the wedding of Henry IV of France and Maria de' Medici in 1600 (an event which caused Cavalieri to leave Florence in fury), and he also seems to have rushed his own opera Euridice into print before Peri's opera on the same subject could be published, while simultaneously ordering his group of singers to {{have nothing to do with}} Peri's production.|$|E
25|$|The game is {{presented}} {{against the background}} {{of the history of the}} One Ring. At the dawn of the Second Age, after the defeat of the Dark Lord, Morgoth, the elves of Eregion forged the nineteen Rings of Power to help themselves, the dwarves and men rule Middle-earth. However, the elves were unaware that Sauron, Morgoth's closest ally, had survived his master's defeat, and in the guise of Annatar had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> taught the Elven-smiths, led by Celebrimbor, how to forge the Rings, whilst, in secret, he forged his own One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, a Ring far more powerful than any of the others. However, in order for the One Ring to be powerful enough to control the other Rings, Sauron had to transfer most of his power into it. As soon as he put it on, the elves became aware of his ruse, removing and hiding their Three Rings, which Celebrimbor had forged without Sauron's aid. Sauron waged war on the elves, conquering much of Middle-earth and killing Celebrimbor. Thus began the Dark Years, when Sauron took possession of the remaining sixteen Rings, giving seven to the dwarves and nine to men in an effort to corrupt them. The dwarves proved relatively immune to the powers of the Rings, acquiring only a greed for gold, and becoming unconcerned with events in the wider world. Men proved less resilient, and the nine kings given the Rings become the nine Ring-wraiths, or Nazgûl, led by the Witch-king of Angmar.|$|E
500|$|Her {{defense team}} {{undertook}} its own investigation, hoping to disprove state witnesses' testimony identifying the fire as arson. They found that accelerant had, indeed, {{been used to}} stoke the fire and that a robe belonging to Green {{had been on the}} floor of the master bathroom, burned in a manner that indicated it had been worn while one of the unconnected fires was set. According to Ellen Ryan, when confronted with this evidence, Green acknowledged having set the fire that destroyed her home, but denied any clear memory of the event. She continued to claim that Tim Farrar had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> poisoned his father. Green agreed to place an Alford plea of [...] "no contest".|$|E

500|$|From 1489 to 1495, Josquin was {{a member}} of the papal choir, first under Pope Innocent VIII, and later under the Borgia pope Alexander VI. He may have gone there as part of a singer {{exchange}} with Gaspar van Weerbeke, who went back to Milan at the same time. While there, he may have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> carved his name into the wall of the Sistine Chapel; a [...] "JOSQUINJ" [...] was recently revealed by workers restoring the chapel. Since it was traditional for singers to carve their names into the walls, and hundreds of names were inscribed there during the period from the 15th to the 18th centuries, it is considered highly likely that the graffiti is by Josquin– and if so, it would be his only surviving autograph.|$|E
500|$|The top GC {{men in the}} peloton and the {{specialist}} climbers formed a chase group that overhauled Voigt in the final [...] The attacks of Colombian climber Mauricio Soler had been responsible for driving this group to catch {{the remnants of the}} breakaway, and he attacked again in the final , quickly getting a gap over the competition and appearing poised for the stage win. As Soler had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> caused the crash that kept Mark Cavendish from potentially defending the pink jersey the day before, his combativeness on this stage was described as his [...] "redemption". 2007 Giro d'Italia winner Danilo Di Luca timed his sprint to the line just right and overtook Soler for the victory. Sixteen riders finished with the same time as Di Luca, ten more were six seconds back, and a further 26 were inside a minute of his winning time. Thomas Lövkvist, who finished in the same group as Di Luca, took a narrow lead in the overall classification after the stage. However, Di Luca later tested positive for EPO and was stripped of his victory. The stage win was subsequently awarded to Stefano Garzelli, the runner-up.|$|E
500|$|Elena Pignatti, who had {{employed}} Morisi {{after she}} left the Mortaras in 1857—her words about Morisi's misconduct had formed part of the Mortaras' appeal to the Pope—testified that [...] "seven or eight years ago... a son of the Mortaras, whose name I don't know, became sick, and {{it was said that}} he was going to die. Around then, one morning... I ran into Morisi. Among the other things we talked about, she—without mentioning the child's illness—asked me, 'I've heard that if you baptise a Jewish child who's about to die he goes to Heaven and gets indulgence; isn't that right?' I don't remember what I told her, but when the Mortara boy was kidnapped by order of the Dominican Father, I was sure that he must have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> was sick". Pignatti said that she had herself seen Edgardo during his illness, and Marianna sitting by the crib—"Since his mother was crying, and despaired for his life, I thought he was dying, also because of his appearance: his eyes were closed, and he was hardly moving." [...] She added that during the three months when Morisi worked for her in late 1857, the servant had been summoned to San Domenico four or five times, and had said that the inquisitor had promised her a dowry.|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} {{versions}} of how Williams {{got his first}} guitar. His mother stated that she bought it with money from selling peanuts, but many other prominent residents of the town claimed to have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> purchased the guitar for him. While living in Georgiana, Williams met Rufus [...] "Tee-Tot" [...] Payne, a street performer. Payne gave Williams guitar lessons in exchange for meals prepared by Lillie Williams or money. Payne's base musical style was blues. He taught Williams chords, chord progressions, bass turns, and the musical style of accompaniment that he would use in most of his future songwriting. Later on, Williams recorded {{one of the songs}} that Payne taught him, [...] "My Bucket's Got a Hole in It". Williams musical style contained influences from Payne along with several other country influences, among them [...] "the Singing Brakeman" [...] Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican, and Roy Acuff. In 1937 Williams got into a fight with his physical education coach about exercises the coach wanted him to do. His mother subsequently demanded that the school board terminate the coach; when they refused, the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama. Payne and Williams lost touch, though eventually, Payne also moved to Montgomery, where he died in poverty in 1939. Williams later credited him as his only teacher.|$|E
500|$|After Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) {{was pushed}} from the Lassiter's Hotel mezzanine, Mark was {{introduced}} {{as the lead}} detective on the case. Mark had his [...] "work cut out for him" [...] as he began questioning the suspects, as they each pointed the finger at someone else. He also received conflicting information as everyone had their own suspicions as to who committed the crime. McGregor revealed that Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) had given Rebecca Robinson (Jane Hall) a false alibi, Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) points out that Diana Marshall (Jane Badler) earring was found {{at the crime scene}} and Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) did not help himself with his attitude towards the investigation. Of the case, McGregor said [...] "Brennan is {{in the thick of the}} investigation so it's pretty exciting, I've never had so much responsibility." [...] McGregor later explained that it had been [...] "great" [...] to be involved in the storyline, even though he did not share many scenes with Dennis, as he was in a hospital bed. Rebecca was revealed to have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> pushed Paul and McGregor said that he knew early on in the storyline that she was the culprit. However, Mark did not know that Rebecca was responsible as he had been thrown by the false alibis. McGregor later said that his first week on Neighbours, filming the Who Pushed P.R? storyline, had stuck in his mind as there were many long interview scenes he had to get through.|$|E
