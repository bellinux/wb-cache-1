5|$|Contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a {{negative}} score are automatically {{eliminated from the}} game at that point and awarded the third place prize. On at least one episode hosted <b>by</b> <b>Art</b> Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played. This rule is still in-place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested {{that it is not}} set in stone and that executive producer Harry Friedman may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur. During Celebrity Jeopardy! games, contestants with a $0 or negative score are given $1,000 for the Final Jeopardy! round.|$|E

5|$|Following Ruisdael's trip to Germany, his landscapes {{took on a}} more heroic character, with forms {{becoming}} {{larger and}} more prominent. A view of Bentheim Castle, dated 1653, {{is just one of}} a dozen of Ruisdael's depictions of a particular castle in Germany, almost all of which pronounce its position on a hilltop. Significantly, Ruisdael made numerous changes to the castle's setting (it is actually on an unimposing low hill) culminating in a 1653 version which shows it on a wooded mountain. These variations are considered <b>by</b> <b>art</b> historians to be evidence of Ruisdael's compositional skills.|$|E
5|$|Guardian {{operates}} {{with five}} trains, each containing two cars that were manufactured <b>by</b> <b>Art</b> Engineering. Each car seats four riders back-to-back in seated rows; each train can seat eight riders. Every seat has a lap-bar restraint, a light gun, and a loudspeaker that provides sound during the ride. This configuration allows {{the ride to}} theoretically carry 650 riders per hour. The cars can rotate 90 degrees in both directions. The trains' light guns are programmed to display a unique colour on the ride's screens to indicate where each rider is shooting and to distinguish between shooters.|$|E
5|$|In 1855/56, Guise Brittan had Englefield Lodge {{built on}} land {{alongside}} the Avon River {{just outside the}} initial town area (these days the area {{to the east of}} Fitzgerald Avenue). Joseph Brittan chose land a short distance downstream along the Avon River and had his homestead, Linwood House, built in 1857. Fooks was the architect for Linwood House, and, based on an assessment <b>by</b> <b>art</b> historian Dr Ian Lochhead, it is likely that he also designed Englefield Lodge. Joseph Brittan called his property and farm Linwood after his home in Linwood, Hampshire.|$|E

5|$|Just {{before the}} Japanese {{surrender}} {{that ended the}} war, News-Miner editor David Tewkesbury died. He was replaced <b>by</b> <b>Art</b> Bremer, a reporter.

Meanwhile, Quantic Dream programmers, artists, and animators, led <b>by</b> <b>art</b> director Christophe Brusseaux, designed the computer-generated imagery seen in the game. David Cage provided writing and direction and Guillaume de Fondaumière was the video game producer.|$|E

5|$|The {{attribution}} {{of the panel}} reflects the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century scholarship on Early Netherlandish art. It is now {{thought to have been}} completed c. 1438–40, but there are still arguments for dates as early as 1424–29. As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in the Turin-Milan Hours manuscript, the panel was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck in the 1875 Gemäldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 claim <b>by</b> <b>art</b> historian Georges Hulin de Loo. This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works. By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was done between 1885 and 1888, {{during one of}} Jovanović's trips through the Balkans.

It remained in the French Gallery's possession until 1893, when it was purchased by a London buyer. In 1935, the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs purchased the work and bestowed it to the National Museum of Serbia, in whose possession it remains. In 2009, the painting began undergoing restoration.|$|E
