5|$|Limited {{knowledge}} of the taxonomy, biogeography and natural history of deep sea communities prevents accurate assessment {{of the risk of}} species extinctions from large-scale mining. Data acquired from the abyssal North Pacific and North Atlantic suggest that deep-sea ecosystems may be adversely affected by mining operations on decadal time scales. In 1978, a dredge aboard the Hughes Glomar Explorer, operated by the American mining consortium Ocean Minerals Company (OMCO), made a mining track at a depth of 5000meters in the nodule fields of the CCFZ. In 2004, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER) conducted the Nodinaut expedition to this mining track (which is still visible on the seabed) to study the long-term effects of this physical disturbance on the sediment and its <b>benthic</b> <b>fauna.</b> Samples taken of the superficial sediment revealed that its physical and chemical properties had not shown any recovery since the disturbance made 26 years earlier. On the other hand, the biological activity measured in the track by instruments aboard the manned submersible bathyscaphe Nautile did not differ from a nearby unperturbed site. This data suggests that the <b>benthic</b> <b>fauna</b> and nutrient fluxes at the water–sediment interface has fully recovered.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{commercial}} {{contractors are}} currently {{licensed by the}} International Seabed Authority (an intergovernmental organization established to organize and control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area {{beyond the limits of}} national jurisdiction) to explore nodule resources and to test mining techniques in eight claim areas, each covering 150,000km². When mining ultimately begins, each mining operation is projected to directly disrupt 300–800km² of seafloor per year and disturb the <b>benthic</b> <b>fauna</b> over an area 5–10 times that size due to redeposition of suspended sediments. Thus, over the 15-year projected duration of a single mining operation, nodule mining might severely damage abyssal seafloor communities over areas of 20,000 to 45,000km² (a zone at least the size of Massachusetts).|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{considerable}} discussion concerning the biostratigraphic correlations between planktonic zonations and the classical Neogene California benthic foraminiferal stages. One of the primary objectives of IPOD Leg 63 was to investigate these correlations and to determine the possibility of temporal variation of the benthic stages between California land sections and the outer Continental Borderland. In addition, it was anticipated that analyses of the <b>benthic</b> foraminiferal <b>faunas</b> at Site 468 would provide critical information on the paleoenvironmental history of the outer borderland. The provincial benthic Neogene foraminiferal stages were established by Kleinpell (1938) for the Miocene and Natland (1952) for the Pliocene-Pleistocene; both are well-documented in designated type sections. These stages have been used for interbasinal correlations, although time-transgressive problems have been suggested by several authors (Bandy, 1971; Ingle, 1967, 1973; Crouch and Bukry, 1979). An important biostratigraphic sequence occurs at Site 468, significant because of its relatively shallow depth of approximately 1700 meters. The samples yield well-preserved <b>benthic</b> foraminiferal <b>faunas</b> throughout most of the Neogene sequence and are accompanied by abundant well-preserved calcareous and siliceous planktonic assemblages. It is this co-occurrence of both planktonic and <b>benthic</b> <b>faunas</b> that enables the correlation of outer continental margin sediments with those of the classical land-based sections of southern California...|$|R
40|$|Late Cenozoic <b>benthic</b> foraminiferal <b>faunas</b> {{from the}} Caribbean Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 502 (3052 m) and East Pacific DSDP Site 503 (3572 m) were {{analyzed}} to interpret bottom-water masses and paleoceanographic changes occurring as the Isthmus of Panama emerged. Major changes {{during the past}} 7 Myr occur at 6. 7 - 6. 2, 3. 4, 2. 0, and 1. 1 Ma in the Caribbean and 6. 7 - 6. 4, 4. 0 - 3. 2, 2. 1, 1. 4, and 0. 7 Ma in the Pacific. Prior to 6. 7 Ma, <b>benthic</b> foraminiferal <b>faunas</b> at both sites indicate the presence of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). After 6. 7 Ma <b>benthic</b> foraminiferal <b>faunas</b> indicate a shift to warmer water masses: North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) in the Caribbean and Pacific Deep Water (PDW) in the Pacific. Flow of NADW may have continued across the rising sill between the Caribbean and Pacific until 5. 6 Ma when the Pacific <b>benthic</b> foraminiferal <b>faunas</b> suggest a decrease in bottom-water temperatures. After 5. 6 Ma deep-water to intermediate-water flow across the sill appears to have stopped as the bottom-water masses {{on either side of}} the sill diverge. The second change recorded by <b>benthic</b> foraminiferal <b>faunas</b> occurs at 3. 4 Ma in the Caribbean and 4. 0 - 3. 2 Ma in the Pacific. At this time the Caribbean is flooded with cold AABW, which is either gradually warmed or is replaced by Glacial Bottom Water (GBW) at 2. 0 Ma and by NADW at 1. 1 Ma. These changes are related to global climatic events and to the depth of the sill between the Caribbean and Atlantic rather than the rising Isthmus of Panama. <b>Benthic</b> foraminiferal <b>faunas</b> at East Pacific Site 503 indicate a gradual change from cold PDW to warmer PDW between 4. 0 and 3. 2 Ma.

40|$|A {{high-resolution}} record, covering 9. 3 – 0. 2 [*]ka BP, {{from the}} sub-arctic Stjernsund (70 °N) was studied for <b>benthic</b> foraminiferal <b>faunas</b> and stable isotopes, revealing three informally named main phases during the Holocene. The Early- to Mid-Holocene (9. 3 – 5. 0 [*]ka BP) {{was characterized by}} the strong influence of the North Atlantic Current (NAC), which prevented {{the reflection of the}} Holocene Climatic Optimum (HCO) in the bottom-water temperature. During the Mid-Holocene Transition (5. 0 – 2. 5 [*]ka BP), a turnover of <b>benthic</b> foraminiferal <b>faunas</b> occurred, Atlantic Water species decreased while Arctic-Polar species increased, and the oxygen isotope record showed larger fluctuations. Those variations correspond to a period of global climate change, to spatially more heterogeneous <b>benthic</b> foraminiferal <b>faunas</b> in the Nordic Seas region, and to regionally diverging terrestrial temperatures. The Cool Late Holocene (2. 5 – 0. 2 [*]ka BP) was characterized by increased abundances of Arctic-Polar species and a steady cooling trend reflected in the oxygen isotopes. In this period, our record differs considerably from those on the SW Barents Sea shelf and locations farther south. Therefore, we argue that regional atmospheric cooling triggered the late Holocene cooling trend. Several cold episodes centred at ∼ 8. 3, ∼ 7. 8, ∼ 6. 5, ∼ 4. 9, ∼ 3. 9 and ∼ 3. 3 [*]ka BP were identified from the <b>benthic</b> foraminiferal <b>faunas</b> and the δ 18 O record, which correlated with marine and atmospherically driven proxy records.

The china clay waste and natural sediments {{on the surface and}} subsurface of Mevagissey Bay have been studied and the distribution of live and dead <b>benthic</b> <b>faunas</b> analysed. The <b>benthic</b> <b>faunas</b> presently living in the china clay waste and surrounding shell gravel have been compared to faunas from a similar survey taken during the period of peak discharge (1968) and during the reduction of discharges (1970 - 1973). Within the bay are four different benthic communities whose distribution reflects the amount and nature of china clay waste present. The only notable changes since the the cessation of dumping being the colonisation by a Tellina tenuis community of a previously azoic muddy substrate near the point of waste discharge into the bay. This research suggests that benthic communities in areas subjected toinert solid pollution will change to communities typical of the grain size of the waste. Each community can be recognised by a distinctive death assemblage although these show little resemblance to the composition of the original living community. Different taphonomic processes control the preservation within each community. Radiographs and microscopic examination of impregnated box core samples reveal the important effect of bioturbation on the orientation and position of shells and shell fragments within the substrate. Since the cessation of china clay waste dumping in 1973, shell debris formed by local benthos has began to transform the soft, fine grade substrate into a shell gravel.
