He also uses Remo heads and previously using Regal Tip drumsticks and brushes, he now uses Vater drumsticks, notably the 5A Nude wood tip model and Wire Tap brushes. His setup {{has always been}} simple, mostly consisting of a snare drum, mounted tom, bass drum and floor tom while his usual cymbal setup consists of two crash cymbals, a ride cymbal {{and a pair of}} hi-hats, with an occasional third crash: [...] "I've got four drums.

500|$|The highest paid {{player in}} Major League Baseball (MLB) from the 2013 season is New York Yankees' third baseman Alex Rodriguez {{with an annual}} salary of $29,000,000, $4 million higher than the second-highest paid player, Cliff Lee. MLB {{does not have a}} hard salary cap, instead {{employing}} a luxury tax which applies to teams whose total payroll exceeds certain set thresholds for a given season. Free agency did not exist in MLB prior {{to the end of the}} reserve clause in the 1970s, allowing owners before that time to wholly dictate the terms of player negotiations and resulting in significantly lower salaries. Babe Ruth, widely regarded as one of the greatest baseball players ever, earned an estimated $910,696 ($ inflation-adjusted from 1931 dollars) over his entire playing career. When asked whether he thought he deserved to earn $80,000 a year ($ inflation-adjusted), while the president, Herbert Hoover, had a $75,000 salary, Ruth famously remarked, [...] "What the hell has Hoover got to do with it? <b>Besides,</b> <b>I</b> had a better year than he did." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 2009 {{election}} several {{opinion polls}} showed that Folkvord and Dahle had enough support to earn two seats in parliament. Jens Stoltenberg and Kristin Halvorsen from the Red-Green Coalition were both highly negative towards {{the idea of}} having Red in parliament. Folkvord stated several times that he would demand an immediate withdrawal of Norwegian troops from Afghanistan if elected to parliament. He said this decision involved both the [...] "enthusiastic warriors of the Progress Party" [...] and [...] "the disillusioned skeptics of the Socialist Left". Folkvord later felt he needed to set pressure on the Labour Party which would, according to him, move them further to the left. Labour Party member Reiulf Steen had reacted positively towards {{the idea of having}} Folkvord in parliament saying, [...] "I am a great admirer of Erling Folkvord. He has integrity and great courage. <b>Besides</b> <b>I</b> am overjoyed that Red supports the Red-Green coalition". When the votes were counted Red had an increase of 1% from the 2005 election, but it was not enough to secure Folkvord a seat in parliament. When all the votes were counted the party had gained 1.3% of the national vote, an increase of 0.1%.|$|E

It was in his band Raduga (Радуга, Rainbow) that she has made her singing debut. A strict disciplinarian (who for many years was unwilling to support her ambition to become a professional singer), he proved in retrospect to be a perfect mentor and a major inspiration. [...] "I {{was kind of a}} homely girl; I liked to knit and sew. <b>Besides,</b> <b>I</b> was overweight. All this irritated him immensely: he was sure this way I'd turn out fat, lazy and stupid.

Borges replied, [...] "I think a writer's {{duty is to}} be a writer, and if he can be a good writer, he is doing his duty. <b>Besides,</b> <b>I</b> think of my own opinions as being superficial. For example, I am a Conservative, I hate the Communists, I hate the Nazis, I hate the anti-Semites, and so on; but I don't allow these opinions to find their way into my writings—except, of course, when I was greatly elated about the Six Days' War. Generally speaking, I think of keeping them in watertight compartments. Everybody knows my opinions, but as for my dreams and my stories, they should be allowed their full freedom, I think.

[...] The young man was good at heart and simple in spirit, but also quiet and secretive. In particular, he would not say much of his frequent visits into the wood of Maria Makiling. But then war came to the land, and army officers came recruiting unmarried young men. The man entered an arranged marriage so that he could stay safely in the village. A few days before his marriage, he visits Maria one last time. [...] "I hope that you were devoted to me," [...] she said sadly, [...] "but you need an earthly love, and you do not have enough faith in me <b>besides.</b> <b>I</b> could have protected you and your family."

2500|$|In the 1999 Swedish film , Floberg {{played the}} role of Claes, one of two {{fishermen}} who rescues Polish Irena, played by Izabella Scorupco, from the water. The two fishermen later gets in trouble, as it turns out that Irena is being chased by members of the russian mafia. This was the fifth time Floberg played in a film directed by Erik Gustavson, who praised him: [...] " [...] is my Robert De Niro. Our fifth film together. It has always gone well". Floberg, on the other hand, dryly commented: [...] "Yes, I got a phone call [...] this time too". In an interview with Verdens Gang, he elaborated on his relationship with Gustavson: [...] "We have a really good understanding. We talk a lot in codes, and save a lot of time. <b>Besides,</b> <b>I</b> really like the way Erik works". Floberg also expressed his satisfaction with playing a [...] "good guy" [...] for once, humorously acknowledging that he is probably considered Norway's [...] "number one movie-psycho". Co-star Scorupco, on the other hand, characterized Floberg as charming, and [...] "easy to fall in love with". In Misery Harbour, a Scandinavian/Canadian collaboration from the same year, Floberg returned to playing a negative character. He received critical acclaim for his depiction of the arrogant literary critic Johan Hoeg, being described as [...] "brilliant", and [...] "taking on the role (...) with razor-sharp spitefulness".|$|E
2500|$|In 272, Bu Chan, the {{military}} commander stationed at Xiling (西陵), started a rebellion against Wu {{and sent a}} messenger to the Jin dynasty to express his wish to defect to Jin. When Lu Kang received news of the revolt, he immediately gave orders to his subordinates Zuo Yi (左奕), Wu Yan (吾彥), Cai Gong (蔡貢) and others to lead separate forces and head towards Xiling via shortcuts. He instructed his men to construct defensive structures {{all the way from}} Chixi (赤谿) to Gushi (故市) so as to form an encirclement around Bu Chan's position, {{while at the same time}} defending the area from attacks by Jin forces. He ordered them to work day and night to complete the construction works as if the enemy had already arrived, and his soldiers were all tired and worn out. Lu Kang's subordinates said, [...] "With our current strength, we can attack Bu Chan and destroy him before Jin forces arrive. Why are we exhausting ourselves by constructing defensive structures instead?" [...] Lu Kang replied, [...] "Xiling's fortifications are very stable and it has sufficient supplies. <b>Besides,</b> <b>I</b> was the one who oversaw the construction of Xiling's defences. If we attack it now, I don't think we can conquer it easily. If Jin forces show up and we don't have adequate defensive structures, we'll be trapped in between Bu Chan and Jin and have nothing to protect ourselves from the enemy." [...] The officers repeatedly urged Lu Kang to attack Xiling but Lu refused. Eventually, Lei Tan (雷譚), the Administrator (太守) of Yidu (宜都), came to see Lu Kang and used kind words to persuade him to attack Xiling. To prove that he was right, Lu Kang relented and ordered an assault on Xiling. As he expected, they did not succeed in capturing the city, so his officers gave up their idea of attacking and complied with Lu Kang's orders to construct the defensive structures.|$|E

2500|$|At 6:28a.m., {{two minutes}} {{ahead of the}} time set as H-Hour, Schroeder's unit {{was in the first}} wave of 20LCVPs to {{disembark}} on Utah Beach. Schroeder's own assault boat, commanded by navy Lieutenant (j.g.) Abraham Condiotti of Brooklyn, New York, was the first to hit the beach. In his boat were 32men, including Brigadier General Roosevelt. He recalled to a television interviewer in 2008 that [...] "80percent of the guys on the boat were sick" [...] due to the rough seas and, as his landing craft in the first wave neared the shore, Allied forces were still shelling Company F's designated landing site on Utah Beach. [...] "They were dropping all those bombs on the place where we were going in" [...] and his company had to disembark [...] "without getting bombed by our own guys". [...] He held his [...]45-caliber pistol above the waist-high water as he waded the final [...] from his landing craft to the beach. In the lead landing craft, he covered the remaining distance as quickly as possible due to enemy fire. The soldiers encountered machine gun fire from German pillboxes and artillery shelling, underwater mines, barbed wire, and trenches. His company's mission was to break up the enemy's fortified seawall and then liberate a village five miles inland. Half of his men were casualties and Schroeder himself was shot twice in the left arm. He was hospitalized in England and later in South Carolina and almost had his arm amputated due to the severity of his wounds. [...] Asked later if {{he knew that he was}} the first soldier on the beach, he said, [...] "I knew my company was in the first wave, but I didn't know I was actually going to be the first ashore. [...] <b>Besides,</b> <b>I</b> was too scared to think about it". Afterwards, he was hailed in a Pentagon press release as [...] "the first GI to invade Europe". The Baltimore Sun said of Schroeder afterwards, [...] "when his boot touched French soil, it was a great moment in history". He earned a Silver Star, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart during World War II, in addition to numerous other decorations.|$|E
2500|$|Like Dutch {{football}} in general until the mid-1960s, Cruyff's early playing career was considerably influenced by coaching philosophy of British/English coaches such as Vic Buckingham. However, his footballing philosophy shares more similar aspects to free-flowing style of South American football (Brazilian {{football in}} particular) than traditional British/Anglo-Saxon school of football (with distinctively direct, aggressive, heavily athletic, muscular, physical elements in coaching and playing style). The mind-body duality always {{plays an important}} role in his footballing philosophy. In Cruyff’s words, quoted in Dennis Bergkamp's autobiography Stillness and Speed: My Story, “...Because you play football with your head, and your legs are there to help you. If you don't use your head, using your feet won't be sufficient. Why does a player have to chase the ball? Because he started running too late. You have to pay attention, use your brain and find the right position. If you get to the ball late, it means you chose the wrong position. Bergkamp was never late.” For Cruyff, football (the so-called beautiful game) is much an artistic-oriented mind-body game instead of an athletic-oriented physical competition. As he put it, [...] "Every trainer talks about movement, about running a lot. I say don't run so much. Football is a game you play with your brain. You have to be in the right place at the right moment, not too early, not too late." [...] The creativity is always the key element in his footballing philosophy, both as a player and as a manager. Cruyff once compared his more intuitive and individualistic approach with Louis van Gaal's more mechanized and rigid coaching style, “Van Gaal has a good vision on football. But it's not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics. I don't. I want individuals to think for themselves and take the decision on the pitch that is best for the situation... I don't have anything against computers, but you judge football players intuitively and with your heart. On the basis of the criteria which are now in use at Ajax [...] I would have failed the test. When I was 15, I could barely kick the ball 15 metres with my left and with the right maybe 20 metres. I would not have been able to take a corner. <b>Besides,</b> <b>I</b> was physically weak and relatively slow. My two qualities were great technique and insight, which happen to be two things you can’t measure with a computer.” ...|$|E
