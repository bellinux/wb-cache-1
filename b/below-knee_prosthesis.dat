40|$|Abstract—Although <b>below-knee</b> <b>prostheses</b> {{have been}} commercially {{available}} for some time, today’s devices are completely passive, and consequently, their mechanical properties remain fixed with walking speed and terrain. To improve the current performance of <b>below-knee</b> <b>prostheses,</b> we study {{the feasibility of}} using the amputee’s residual limb EMG signals to control the ankle position of an active ankle-foot prosthesis. We propose two control schemes to predict the amputee’s intended ankle position: a neural network approach and a muscle model approach. We test these approaches using EMG data measured from an amputee for several target ankle movement patterns. We find that both controllers demonstrate the ability to predict desired ankle movement patterns qualitatively. In the current implementation, the biomimetic EMG-controller demonstrates a smoother and more natural movement pattern than that demonstrated by the neural network approach, suggesting that a biologically-motivated, model-based approach may offer certain advantages in the control of active ankle prostheses.

40|$|Nowadays, {{prosthetic}} {{manufacturers have}} developed new designs of <b>below-knee</b> <b>prosthesis</b> which are anthropomorphic and safe. But more {{research should be}} done. This project tries to find out optimized parameters of <b>below-knee</b> <b>prosthesis</b> to walk with as low energy as possible. A biomechanical optimal problem is formulated to find out suitable stiffness and damping properties of <b>below-knee</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> These properties mean {{the relation between the}} torque on the ankle joint of the prosthetic leg with ankle angle and its velocity. The criterion used has been minimizing energy of both on the healthy part of the body as well as external energy with which the prosthesis battery is supplied. In order to state the optimal problem, firstly an anthropomorphic human gait has been looked for by using computer simulations. It has been chosen a mechanical human model that consist of two legs (with thigh and shank), the trunk and with joints: at ankle, knee and hip. Foot has been modeled as footprint. The system has 7 degrees of freedom. The motion has been parameterized by using polynomial and Fourier series and their parameters have been chosen so that the motion was anthropomorphic. Control torques at joints and ground reaction forces have been determined by using Lagrange equations. After that, the optimization problem has been considered using energy of the healthy part of the body as cost function, while energy consumed by the prosthesis has been calculated in each variance. Algorithm of solution of optimization problem has been implemented in MATLAB so that optimized kinematic parameters of the gait as well as stiffness and damping parameters of the <b>below-knee</b> <b>prosthesis</b> are determined automatically. fmincon function is used to solve the optimal problem and ode 45 function to solve the differential equation to find out kinematics of the trunk.

In 79 cases (70 %) the prosthesis was up to 47 mm too short and in 17 cases (15 %) up to 40 mm too long. Chronic pain symptoms of low back, hip and knee correlated significantly with the lateral asymmetry caused by incorrect length of the prosthesis. Independently of the side of amputation, the unilateral sciatica and chronic hip pain occurred mainly on the long leg side. Physical activity of the lower limb amputees seemed to correlate with the suitability of the length of the prosthesis, and was unrelated to the length of the amputation stump...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of the}} Gait Analysis Improvement Team {{project is}} to design and develop an {{improved}} method to obtain quantitative measurements of the forces transmitted through <b>below-knee</b> <b>prostheses.</b> These measurements should be connected to suggested alignment changes that would improve the gait of a patient. In general, the design should provide a more scientific and cost effective procedure for the initial fitting of a prosthesis, including determination of the best alignment. Several alternatives for the design have been researched and ranked according to their adherence to the criteria described below. The intended end user of this design is a prosthetist working with an amputee in a clinical setting. Because amputees typically have more difficulty with balance than non-amputees, safety is a primary concern and a heavily-weighted criterion in the decision-making process. Any device that is incorporated into the fitting procedure must not compromise the safety of existing prostheses and related equipment. The next most important criterion is cost. The budget for this project is restricted to $ 1, 200 and the device must also present an economical alternative to existing methods of computerized gait analysis. Additional cost guidelines were suggested by our technical consultant. The device should not exceed $ 150 if it is used fewer than five times. If it is used {{for more than five}} prosthesis fitting appointments, it may cost up to $ 500. These are rough estimates but should be considered when evaluating potential solutions. The design will not be successful unless it can be used along with existing (standard) prosthesis components, so compatibility is the third most important criterion. If force measurements are not consistent, accurate and precise, the project will fall short of the goals. Therefore measurement quality is ranked fourth among the working criteria. The final two criteria are durability and ease of use for the end-users (clinicians working with amputees). Ideally, the design will be able to withstand many uses rather than serve as one-time-use equipment. If {{it is not easy to}} install, operate and remove, it is not likely to appeal to a clinician in an average prosthetic facility...|$|R

The results were based on investigation of eight unilateral below-knee amputees evaluating their own sockets by Visual Analogous Scale with respect to combrt, pressure, and pain. The sockets were evaluated on seven occasions, at two tests. on delivery, after use every second day for six days and every second week for two weeks. All CAD-CAM sockets except one had to be changed once as compared to the hand made of which only two had to be changed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was two-fold: 1) {{demonstrate}} a technique that can be used to directly estimate the inertial properties of a <b>below-knee</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> and 2) contrast the effects of the proposed technique and that of using intact limb inertial properties on joint kinetic estimates during walking in unilateral, transtibial amputees. An oscillation and reaction board system was validated and shown to be reliable when measuring inertial properties of known geometrical solids. When direct measurements of inertial properties of the prosthesis were used in inverse dynamics modeling of the lower extremity compared with inertial estimates based on an intact shank and foot, joint kinetics at the hip and knee were significantly lower during the swing phase of walking. Differences in joint kinetics during stance, however, were smaller than those observed during swing. Therefore, researchers focusing on the swing phase of walking should consider the impact of prosthesis inertia property estimates on study outcomes.

The {{aim of this study}} was to describe a hind foot (including the calcaneum and fat pad) sensate flap with a surface that allows full terminal weight bearing in transtibial amputations in adults. Between June 2007 and September 2008, eight patients underwent leg amputations with a sensate composite calcaneal flap reconstruction of the stump. Patients consisted of four men and four women with a mean age of 46.5 (26 – 66) years. All amputations were unilateral. The mean follow-up was 28.3 (25 – 42) months. There were no complications.

The {{aim of this study}} was to describe a hind foot (including the calcaneum and fat pad) pedicled sensate flap with a surface that allowed full terminal weight-bearing in transtibial amputations in adults. One male patient, 66 years old with schizophrenia and chronic distal tibial osteomyelitis, underwent a leg amputation with sensate composite calcaneal flap construction.

The flap described provides proprioceptive feedback with the best bone and skin to support weight bearing.

40|$|Abstract-In this study, {{a finite}} element (FE) {{model of a}} <b>below-knee</b> <b>prosthesis</b> of patellar tendon-bearing (PTB) design, and several altered {{variations}} of the model have been constructed. A load of approximately 1. 5 times normal body weight (984 N) was applied at the heel of the model to simulate heelstrike con-ditions. The "base " model was then analyzed and revised iteratively until a model which provided consistency between soft tissue elastic modulus and socket displacement was devel-oped. The interface normal and shear stresses obtained from the analysis of this revised base model were highest (about 961, and 463 KPa, respectively) at the distal anterior tip of the socket/stump. Proximally, higher normal stresses (72 - 78 KPa) were found medially and posteriorly. Proximal shear stresses were highest posteriorly (79 KPa), although shear stresses medially (51 KPa), and laterally (43 KPa), were also much higher than anteriorly (10 KPa). FE analyses were performed on the altered models to determine the relative effects on socket/stump interface stresses of altering the FE, model of the prosthesis. Results of the analysis indicate that fabricating the prosthesis from a material with an elastic modulus ten times {{lower than that of}} the revised base model can produce reductions in the maximum pressure of up to 14 percent. Large decreases in max-imum pressures (71 percent) resulted from the use of a suction socket rather than a conventional socket.

40|$|At {{present time}} {{development}} of mathematical models for calculation of a force {{field in the}} "stump-reception socket" system of leg prosthesis of a person becomes a more and more actual direction {{in the field of}} biomechanics and prosthetics. Usage of these models alongside with possibilities of modern computer systems allows operatively, in real time, to calculate and estimate force loading on a stump, purposefully to select parameters of a socket with the purpose of improving its comfort and functionality. The locomotion of the person is modelled by a spatial system of absolute rigid bodies. A surface of a socket of prosthesis is approximated to isosceles trapezoids. An influence of a stump on a socket is changed by a force field {Fi}. It is supposed, that the forces operating within the limits of one trapezoid, are peer among themselves, orthogonal planes of the given trapezoid and are directed outside. A resultant vector of supporting responses of a plane of walking and a point of its application are considered to be given (known from experiments). For a regularization of statically acritical problem the quadratic functional constructed on a hypothesis about uniform distribution of pressure of a socket on a stump is used: &# 1060;=&# 8721;Fi 2 &# 8594;min. For a solution of the formulated problem standard methods of constraint optimization were used. Initial data for modelling were: geometry of prosthesis, weight of units of prosthesis, magnitude and a point of application of a vector of supporting responses. In result the field of the forces influencing on a stump in above-knee prosthesis and <b>below-knee</b> <b>prosthesis</b> was calculated, that has allowed estimating influence of geometrical parameters of prosthesis and a spatial position of prosthesis on character and magnitudes of the pressure originating in the stump-socket system.
