40|$|Abstract—With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of Internet, some <b>bad</b> <b>behaviors</b> such as network attack and bandwidth abuse {{become more and}} more serious, result in wasting the limited resources of network. Cernet 2, the experimental IPV 6 network, is suffering from the shortage of monitoring resources, so how to maximize the utilization of the limited resources is an urgent problem. In this paper, we propose the traffic-based network credit management system. According to the credit status of each node, we can apply the appropriate monitoring force. We firstly capture the traffic of Cernet 2 by NetFlow, and use statistical methods to identify network <b>bad</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Then assign each node a credit score. Finally, display the credit status and corresponding statistical analysis of each node on the credit management website in real time.

Conservatives like Beck saw the need to regulate <b>bad</b> <b>behavior</b> {{in the corporate world}} with the intention of protecting corporate capitalism from radical forces, but they were alarmed by the anti-business and pro-union proposals of Roosevelt after 1905.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new framework for Equivalence Checking (EC) of Boolean circuits based on a general technique called Logic Relaxation (LoR). The essence of LoR is to relax the formula to be solved and compute a superset S of the set of new behaviors. Namely, S contains all new satisfying assignments that appeared due to relaxation and does not contain assignments satisfying the original formula. Set S is generated by a procedure called partial quantifier elimination. If all possible <b>bad</b> <b>behaviors</b> are in S, the original formula cannot have them and so the property described by this formula holds. The appeal of EC by LoR is twofold. First, it facilitates generation of powerful inductive proofs. Second, proving inequivalence comes down to checking the presence of some <b>bad</b> <b>behaviors</b> in the relaxed formula i. e. in a simpler version of the original formula. We give some experimental evidence that supports our approach...|$|R
50|$|Positive Discipline (or PD) is a {{discipline}} model used by schools, and in parenting, {{that focuses on}} the positive points of behaviour, {{based on the idea that}} there are no bad children, just good and <b>bad</b> <b>behaviors.</b> You can teach and reinforce the good behaviors while weaning the <b>bad</b> <b>behaviors</b> without hurting the child verbally or physically. People engaging in positive discipline are not ignoring problems. Rather, they are actively involved in helping their child learn how to handle situations more appropriately while remaining calm, friendly and respectful to the children themselves. Positive discipline includes a number of different techniques that, used in combination, can lead to a more effective way for parents to manage their kids behaviour, or for teachers to manage groups of students. Some of these are listed below.Positive Behavior Support (PBS) is a structured, open-ended model that many parents and schools follow. It promotes positive decision making, teaching expectations to children early, and encouraging positive behaviors.|$|R

In this work we present an automatic extraction method to determine the domains of competence of Fuzzy Rule Based Classification Systems As a case of study we use the Fuzzy Hybrid Genetic Based Machine Learning method. We consider twelve metrics of data complexity in order to analyze the behavior patterns of this method, obtaining intervals of such data complexity measures with good or bad performance of it. Combining these intervals we obtain rules that describe both good or <b>bad</b> <b>behaviors</b> of the Fuzzy Rule Based Classification System mentioned. These rules allow describe both good or <b>bad</b> <b>behaviors</b> of the Fuzzy Rule Based Classification Systems mentioned, allowing us to characterize the response quality of the methods from the data set complexity metrics of a given data set.

25|$|Alexander Maconochie, a Scottish {{geographer}} and {{captain in}} the Royal Navy, introduced the modern idea of parole when, in 1840, he was appointed superintendent of the British penal colonies in Norfolk Island, Australia. He developed a plan {{to prepare them for}} eventual return to society that involved three grades. The first two consisted of promotions earned through good behaviour, labour, and study. The third grade in the system involved conditional liberty outside of prison while obeying rules. A violation would return them to prison and they would start all over again through the ranks of the three-grade process. He reformed its ticket of leave system, instituting what many consider the world's first parole system. Prisoners served indeterminate sentences from which they could be released early if they showed evidence of rehabilitation through participation in a graded classification system based on a unit of exchange called a mark. Prisoners earned marks through good behavior, lost them through <b>bad</b> <b>behavior,</b> and could spend them on passage to higher classification statuses ultimately conveying freedom.|$|E

Los participantes narraron eventos de castigo en el hogar y con menor frecuencia eventos en el colegio. Los papás y las mamás castigan a los niños pegándoles con objetos, con la mano, regañándolos, prohibiéndoles gustos dejándolos en el cuarto. Cuando los castigaban, los participantes manifestaron, entre otros, sentirse mal, aburridos, rabiosos, culpables y confusos. Proponen que, si se portan mal, no les peguen ni los humillen, sino que les hablen y les expliquen. Sin embargo, muchos de los participantes expresaron ideas que justifican el castigo {{corporal}} y humillante, como una medida necesaria para controlar las malas acciones de los niños. Finalmente, discuto los resultados en el contexto de la literatura sobre los efectos del castigo y la política de erradicación del castigo corporal y planteo algunas acciones con diferentes actores locales e institucionales.  ABSTRACTI present a qualitative research study conducted from January through December 2006.
