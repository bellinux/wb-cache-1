50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} as to why <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> are formed but currently, there are only two explanations with any real credibility.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Beach</b> <b>cusps</b> are {{shoreline}} formations made up {{of various}} grades of sediment in an arc pattern. The horns are {{made up of}} coarser material and the embayment contains finer sediment.|$|E
50|$|The {{self-organization}} {{theory was}} introduced by Werner and Fink (1993) and it suggests that <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> form due {{to a combination of}} positive feedback that is operated by beach morphology and swash motion encouraging the topographic irregularity and negative feedback that discourages accretion or erosion on well-developed <b>beach</b> <b>cusps.</b> It is relatively recent that the computational resources and sediment transport formulations became available to show that the stable and rhythmic morphological features can be produced by such feedback systems. The beach cusp spacing, based on the self-organization model, is proportional to the horizontal extent of the swash motion S using the equationwhere the constant of proportionality f is c. 1.5.|$|E
40|$|Morphological {{observations}} (terrestrial laser scanning) {{and sediment}} analysis {{are used to}} study <b>beach</b> <b>cusp</b> morphodynamics at Melbourne Beach (Florida, USA), a moderately sloped beach characterized by fine sand. The study couples rapid high-resolution surveying with surficial sediment sampling over multiple tidal cycles. Surveys were run ~ 500 m alongshore and sediment samples were collected intertidally {{over a period of}} 5 days. <b>Beach</b> <b>cusp</b> location within larger scale beach morphology is shown to directly influence cusp growth as either gross erosional or gross accretional. Sediment characteristics within the <b>beach</b> <b>cusp</b> morphology are reported coincident with cusp evolution. Variations in particle size distribution kurtosis are exhibited as the cusps evolve, however no significant correlation is seen between grain size and position between horn and embayment. During the end of the study, a storm resulted in <b>beach</b> <b>cusp</b> destruction and increased sediment sorting...|$|R

5000|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} debate about whether <b>beach</b> <b>cusp</b> formation {{is associated with the}} presence of standing edge waves (standing edge wave theory), results from self-organizing feedback between changing topography and swash motion (self-organization theory) or is attributable to a number of other less popular mechanisms.|$|R
50|$|This {{theory was}} {{initially}} dismissed due to complications with it but by using more advanced computer simulations, {{it has been}} developed {{to the point where}} it now provides a reasonable alternative to the standing edge wave theory. The theory has two main points that seek to explain the formation of regularly spaced <b>beach</b> <b>cusps.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{swash zone}} is {{the upper part}} of the beach between {{backbeach}} and surf zone, where intense erosion occurs during storms (Figure 2). The swash zone is alternately wet and dry. Infiltration (hydrology) (above the water table) and exfiltration (below the water table) take place between the swash flow and the beach groundwater table. Beachface, berm, beach step and <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> are the typical morphological features associated with swash motion. Infiltration (hydrology) and sediment transport by swash motion are important factors that govern the gradient of the beachface.|$|E
50|$|The {{more common}} {{standing}} edge waves are subharmonic and these {{can have a}} wave period twice that of the incoming wave. This produces a far more complex system of waves as {{by the time the}} incoming wave has completed one cycle from peak to trough, the standing edge waves have done two. So what started as the peak of a standing edge wave within the trough of the incoming wave will change to a trough before the incoming wave has changed so what was initially being given a boost in height now experiences a drop. Essentially {{what this means is that}} there are a regularly spaced series of peaks and troughs along the length on the incoming wave that are caused by its interaction with the standing edge waves and it is these that caused the development of <b>beach</b> <b>cusps.</b>|$|E
50|$|Longshore drift by swash occurs either due to <b>beach</b> <b>cusp</b> {{morphology}} or due to oblique incoming waves causing strong alongshore swash motion. Under {{the influence}} of longshore drift, {{when there is no}} slack-water phase during backwash flows, sediments can remain suspended to result in offshore sediment transport. Beachface erosion by swash processes is not very common but erosion can occur where swash has a significant alongshore component.|$|R
40|$|During {{the period}} of 5 April 2001 - 16 May 2001, {{topographic}} surveys of Del Monte beach in Monterey, California, were performed {{on a regular basis}} to record changes in <b>beach</b> <b>cusp</b> development for comparison to wave data being collected by the Oceanography Department of the Naval Postgraduate School. The surveys were conducted with a Real Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) secured to an all-terrain vehicle (ATV). The surveys were performed by driving the ATV on longshore transects of the beach to measure the vertical variation. From these surveys, {{the size and shape of}} the cusps were determined for each survey, and cusp variations between surveys were compared to the changes in wave conditions. Cusp spacing was determined through spectral analysis of the survey data, which produced peaks at the primary longshore wave numbers of the surf zone and swash cusps. The field data were then compared to current theory regarding <b>beach</b> <b>cusp</b> formation and maintenance in an attempt to determine the causative, maintenance, and destructive mechanisms. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{standing}} {{edge wave}} theory, which {{was introduced by}} Guza and Inman (1975), suggests that swash is superimposed upon the motion of standing edge waves that travel alongshore. This produces a variation in swash height along the shore and consequently results in regular patterns of erosion. The cusp embayments form at the eroding points and cusp horns occur at the edge wave nodes. The <b>beach</b> <b>cusp</b> spacing can be predicted using the sub-harmonic edge wave modelwhere T is incident wave period and tanβ is beach gradient.|$|R
50|$|They can {{be found}} {{all over the world}} and are most {{noticeable}} on shorelines with coarser sediment such as pebble beaches. However, they can occur with sediment of any size. They nearly always occur in a regular pattern with cusps of equal size and spacing appearing along stretches of the shoreline. These cusps are most often a few metres long. However, they may reach 60 m across. Although the origin of <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> has yet to be proven, once cusps have been created they are a self-sustaining formation. This is because when an oncoming wave hits the horn of a beach cusp, it is split and forced into two directions. The crashing of the wave into the cusps slows its velocity, causing coarser sediment to fall out of suspension and be deposited on the horns. The waves then flow along the embayments (picking up finer sediment) and run into one another in the middle. After this collision these waves attempt to flow back out to sea where they are met by incoming waves. Therefore, once the cusp is established, coarser sediment is constantly being deposited on the horn and finer sediment is being eroded away from the embayments. This process causes the horners and embayments to at least maintain their size, if not grow larger.|$|E
40|$|<b>Beach</b> <b>cusps</b> {{are common}} {{features}} of steep reflective and intermediate beaches. However, very few observations have reported double coupled cusp systems. Here, {{we present a}} dataset of observations of a beach exhibiting two sets of <b>beach</b> <b>cusps.</b> Data were collected at Grand Popo Beach (Benin, West Africa) in February 2013. Daily topographic surveys along a 380 in long stretch of shore allowed observation {{of the dynamics of}} the two sets of <b>beach</b> <b>cusps.</b> At the beginning of the field survey, we clearly observe two sets of cusps; the upper <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> system is relatively asymmetric with a typical wavelength of about 45 m, while the lower <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> system is relatively symmetric with a typical wave length slightly shorter (about 35 m). After two days, we measured the total destruction of the lower set of <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> while the upper set of <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> was only partially destroyed. The data suggest that destruction of the lower beach cusp system may be related to persistent accretionary conditions and/or calm conditions but probably also to the transition from wave-driven circulation (dominated by weak alongshore currents with flash and swash rips), to a second period characterized by dominant longshore currents further increasing in speed (with rare swash rips). Conversely, the disappearance of the western upper beach cusp may be related to an accretionary pattern and to the coalescence of two individual features. Our observations, consistent with previous works, suggest that <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> certainly arise as a result of some combination of erosion and accretion...|$|E
40|$|Experiments are {{described}} in which artificial beaches were attacked {{by a combination of}} running waves parallel to the coast and superposed standing waves at right angles to the former. <b>Beach</b> <b>cusps</b> were formed only when a steep beach was eroded by the waves. Observations in nature are cited that appear to support the view that standing waves may be the cause of <b>beach</b> <b>cusps,</b> but further data are needed before a definite conclusion can be arrived at...|$|E
50|$|The <b>beach</b> <b>cusp</b> is a {{crescent-shaped}} {{accumulation of}} sand or gravel surrounding a semicircular depression on a beach. They are formed by swash action and more common on gravel beaches than sand. The spacing of the cusps {{is related to}} the horizontal extent of the swash motion and can range from 10 cm to 50 m. Coarser sediments are found on the steep-gradient, seaward pointing ‘cusp horns’ (Figure 3). Currently there are two theories that provide an adequate explanation for the formation of the rhythmic beach cusps: standing edge waves and self-organization.|$|R
40|$|When we {{consider}} {{the nature of the}} scientific community in conjunction with a sense of typical economic circumstances we find that there are two distinct paths for development. One path involves hypothesis testing and evolution of strategies that are linked with iterations in equipment advances. A second, more complicated scenario, can involve external influences whether economic, political, or otherwise, such as the government closure of NASA 2 ̆ 7 s space program in 2011 which will no doubt influence research in associated fields. The following chapters are an account of examples of two statistical techniques and the importance of both on the two relatively unrelated geological fields of coastal geomorphology and ground water hydrology. The first technique applies a multi-dimensional approach to defining groundwater water table response based on precipitation in areas where it can reasonably be assumed to be the only recharge. The second technique applies a high resolution multi-scalar approach to a geologic setting most often restricted to either high resolution locally, or low resolution regionally. This technique uses time-frequency analysis to characterize cuspate patterns in LIDAR data are introduced using examples from the Atlantic coast of Florida, United States. These techniques permit the efficient study of beachface landforms over many kilometers of coastline at multiple spatial scales. From a LIDAR image, a beach-parallel spatial series is generated. Here, this series is the shore-normal position of a specific elevation (contour line). Well-established time-frequency analysis techniques, wavelet transforms, and S-Transforms, are then applied to the spatial series. These methods yield results compatible with traditional methods and show that it is useful for capturing transitions in cuspate shapes. To apply this new method, a land-based LIDAR study allowing for rapid high-resolution surveying is conducted on Melbourne Beach, Florida and Tairua Beach, New Zealand. Comparisons and testing of two different terrestrial scanning stations are evaluated {{during the course of the}} field investigation. Significant cusp activity is observed at Melbourne Beach. Morphological observations and sediment analysis are used to study <b>beach</b> <b>cusp</b> morphodynamics at the site. Surveys at Melbourne were run 500 m alongshore and sediment samples were collected intertidally over a five-day period. <b>Beach</b> <b>cusp</b> location within larger scale beach morphology is shown to directly influence cusp growth as either predominantly erosional or accretional. Sediment characteristics within the <b>beach</b> <b>cusp</b> morphology are reported coincident with cusp evolution. Variations in pthesis size distribution kurtosis are exhibited as the cusps evolve; however, no significant correlation is seen between grain size and position between horn and embayment. During the end of the study, a storm resulted in <b>beach</b> <b>cusp</b> destruction and increased sediment sorting. In the former technique using multi-dimensional studies, a test of a new method for improving forecasting of surficial aquifer system water level changes with rainfall is conducted. The results provide a more rigorous analysis of common predictive techniques and compare them with the results of the tested model. These results show that linear interpretations of response-to-rainfall data require a clarification of how large events distort prediction and how the binning of data can change the interpretation. Analyses show that the binning ground water recharge data as is typically done in daily format may be useful for quick interpretation but only describes how fast the system responds to an event, not the frequency of return of such a response. Without a secure grasp on the nonlinear nature of water table and rainfall data alike, any binning or isolation of specific data carries the potential for aliasing that must be accounted for in an interpretation. The new model is proven capable of supplanting any current linear regression analysis as a more accurate means of prediction through the application of a multivariate technique. Furthermore, results show that in the Florida surficial aquifer system response-to-rainfall ratios exhibit a maxima most often linked with modal stage...|$|R

To describe a mechanism of sediment sorting directly, the movable bed simulator, which is a granular material model based on the distinct element method is used. In this paper, a hydraulic experiment using an oscillatory water tunnel is conducted to track motion of sediment particles under vertical sorting in sheetflow regime. The three-dimensional movable bed simulator is driven to track detailed motion of individual sediment particles numerically.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of morphological processes controlling {{the evolution of}} sand spit reformation after a tsunami impact is a challenging and interesting topic, especially in highly energetic and micro tidal environments. A field campaign performed during December 2012 at the Mataquito River mouth in Chile, allowed us to simultaneously monitor topobathymetry evolution, wave climate, tidal range, swash zone dynamics and upper beach face evolution over a portion of its sand spit. A video system was set up for a continuous and long-term monitoring {{of the evolution of}} the river mouth and sand spit. Primarily, in this work we focus on the application of a video-derived shoreline detection method to assess shoreline evolution and <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> migration at hourly scales. We test the method performance on short-term episodic migration of <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> recorded during the campaign.

40|$|Swash zone {{topography}} rapidly {{responds to}} the surf zone waves. Understanding how sandy beaches respond to wave action is critical for beach erosion research, and plays {{a critical role in}} the design and maintenance of shore protection structures. The main objectives of this study were to detect the relationship between high-frequency beachface oscillations and surf zone wave characteristics under plunging breakers by using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). The study site is located in Houjiangwan Bay, eastern Guangdong. Topography data were sampled at 6 min intervals. The wave characteristic parameters were calculated by spectrum method. During the field work, the beach showed a reflective state and plunging breakers controlled the surf zone. The <b>beach</b> <b>cusp</b> topography was destructed gradually. The analysis provides 4 canonical correlation processes between the beachface variations and surf zone waves, which explained 95. 28 % of the overall variation in the data. The result shows wave steepness, the irregularity factor and spectral broadness factor had strong impacts on the topography. The wave steepness was the most important factor for beach profile variations.

40|$|The first large nearshore field {{experiment}} in the Gulf of Guinea was conducted at Grand Popo Beach, Benin, in February 2013, on an open wave-dominated micro- to meso-tidal coast, located mid-way between Cotonou and Lome harbours. The overall project aims at understanding at multi-scale (from event to interannual) {{the causes of the}} dramatic erosion observed throughout the Bight of Benin, and caused by the interaction of a large littoral drift with human engineering works. Grand Popo 2013 experiment was designed to measure the processes over the short term and to test the ability of an installed video system to monitor the evolution of this stretch of coast over the longer tenn. The beach, characterized by a low-tide terrace and a high tide reflective part, experiences a long swell (Hs= 1. 6 m, Tp= 16 s, oblique incidence similar to 15 - 20 degrees). Topographic surveys showed a double <b>beach</b> <b>cusp</b> system interaction and repeated surf-zone drifter runs revealed high flash and swash rip activity driven by wave dissipation over the terrace and energetic swash dynamics at the upper reflective beach. Swash was measured over a cusp system at two locations using video poles. Wave reanalyses (ERAInterim) were used to determine the wave climate and its variability, and to quantify sediment transport. This robust methodology is thought to be replicated elsewhere in different coastal environments in West Africa, in particular with the objective to monitor various sites {{within the framework of the}} new West African Coastal Observatory...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{longshore}} sediment transport {{for a variety}} of bathymetric and wave conditions using the National Oceanic Partnership Program (NOPP) NearCoM Model. The model is used {{to determine the effects of}} wave shape and bathymetry changes on the resulting longshore sediment transport. The wave drivers, REF/DIF 1 and REF/DIF S, are used to assess the effects of monochromatic and spectral waves on longshore sediment transport, respectively. SHORECIRC is used as the circulation module and four different sediment transport models are used. Longshore transport comparisons are made with and without skewed orbital velocities in the shear stress and current velocities. It is found that the addition of skewed orbital velocities in shear stress and transport formulations increases longshore sediment transport by increasing time-varying effective shear stress. The addition of skewed orbital velocities greatly increases the transport due to advection by waves. The localized longshore sediment transport is calculated using a generic physics based method and formulas by Bagnold, Bailard, and Bowen, Watanabe, and Ribberink. The transport results for each scenario are compared to the total transport CERC, Kamphuis, and GENESIS formulas. The bathymetries tested include an equilibrium <b>beach</b> profile, <b>cusped</b> <b>beach</b> profiles, and barred beach profiles with different bar locations. The longshore transport on an equilibrium beach profile is modeled for a 0. 2 mm and 0. 4 mm grain size and transport is compared to the CERC formula. The longshore sediment transport for d= 0. 2 mm is larger than d= 0. 4 mm when wave power is small, but as wave power increases the transport for the larger grain size dominates. The transport is also affected by the addition of cusps and bars on an equilibrium beach profile. The barred beach is modified to compare transport between waves breaking at the bar, before the bar, and after the bar. The features affect the transport when the wave powers are small, but as wave heights increase the cusp and bar features induce little change on the longshore sediment transport. M. S.

40|$|<b>Beach</b> <b>cusps</b> are {{swash zone}} {{morphological}} patterns {{that have been}} of interest to many scientists and engineers. This study aims to improve understanding of the formation and long-term evolution of <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> by numerical simulation using a 2 D process-based morphodynamic model, solving the coupled NLSW equations and sediment conservation equation simultaneously. A numerical implementation is applied building {{on the model of}} Dodd et al. (2008), which succeeds in simulating the occurrence of <b>beach</b> <b>cusps.</b> The numerical scheme improves the accuracy and stability of the swash zone computation. Results from a comparison between different numerical implementations concludes that the most suitable numerical scheme is the Roe-averaged scheme of Castro Diaz et al. (2008) with Minmod flux-limiter using the Harten and Hyman (1983) entropy fix method and the Hubbard and Dodd (2002) approach for the shoreline boundary condition. Before simulating the 2 D <b>beach</b> <b>cusps,</b> the sensitivity of the model parameters and two different types of incoming waves are tested in the ID bed change. The sensitivity test results show that there is a convergence of the results when the minimum computational depth (dtol) ≤ 1 mm. Also the relationship between the bed profile and beach cusp parameters is that a greater maximum tip position (xs,max) is achieved, and more erosion in the tip region occurs when the bed friction coefficient (ƒw), the hydraulic conductivity (K), and dtol are smaller. On the other hand, the effect of scaling the sediment transport coefficient (A) is to scale the rate of change of the bed level, and appears not to lead to qualitative differences. Moreover, the incoming sine wave creates three components of 1 D beach profile (long-shore bar, trough, and swash berm) in the computational domain, while the incoming sawtooth wave creates a wider equivalent region, because of wave simply breaking farther offshore. The 2 D simulations give approximately the same beach cusp formation as those of Dodd et al. (2008); however, the geometrical parameters (ƒ) from the self-organisation theory are still high when compared with previous field observation and numerical simulations. The evolution of the <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> is investigated by Fourier and global analyses (Garnier et al., 2006), and can be divided into three stages: 1 D development in the cross-shore profile, 2 D small cusp spacing pattern, and 2 D final bigger cusp spacing pattern, caused by the coalescing of two small bays and subsequent rearrangement to an equal spacing. However, an unphysical behaviour is found during cusp evolution, which is the reversing behaviour between horn and embayment. It appears that this reversible behaviour is caused by deposition at the embayment head, created from high infiltration and the usage of the velocity-only type of sediment transport equation in the model...|$|E
40|$|Large <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> (LBC, {{wavelength}} of ~ 30 m) are intertidal features that can alternately {{exist in the}} swash and in the inner surf zone due to tidal sea level changes. They have a larger cross-shore extent (up to 50 m) than traditional cusps. This extent has been explained by a shift of the swash zone during falling tide. The cusps immerse at rising tide and previous studies indicate that surf zone processes are exclusively destructive. Here, the behaviour of large <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> in the inner surf zone is investigated by using a 2 DH morphological numerical model applied to Trafalgar Beach (Cádiz, Spain). The model {{results indicate that the}} inner surf zone processes do not always destroy the cusps but can in fact reinforce them by considering neither the swash processes nor the tidal changes. More generally, in conditions favouring the presence of the LBC the surf zone of a beach can be unstable, leading to the formation of transverse/oblique sand bars that can have characteristics similar to the LBC. Thus, in principle, the LBC could emerge not only due to swash zone morphodynamics but also due to surf zone morphodynamics or a combination of both. Postprint (published version...|$|E

They are located in the swash zone, near the high tide mark, and form a series of undulations along the beach. Cusp spacing, the distance between consecutive cusp horns, is quasi uniform.

40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of cuspate swash dynamics on transient surf zone circulation is investigated using both field observation at the low-tide terraced Grand Popo beach and wave-phase resolving numerical simulations. The {{ability of the}} model to describing low-tide terrace beach hydrodynamic is tested, and the model is further applied to investigate the role of wave reflection over a rhythmic swash zone pattern on surf zone wave and current. In the numerical simulations, these mechanisms drive higher surf zone irregularities with <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> than for an alongshore-uniform swash zone morphology. Rhythmic swash-based reflection generates a standing wave pattern visible in current and wave fields. The positive feedback of reflection on incoming waves drives occasional strong flash rips occurring with different frequencies than individual waves or groups.

40|$|Morphodynamics, {{the latest}} {{approach}} to surf circulation dynamics and beach morphology, {{is used as}} a framework for analysis of a mixed sand and gravel beach fronting Kaikoura, east coast of the South Island, New Zealand. Within this analysis, a model for morphodynamics developed in Australia is utilized and assessed. The morphodynamics model is a model of morphological sequences thought to result from variations in energy dissipation over the surf zone. The model combines both circulation theory and morphology together and the beach is analysed in all three dimensions. The major aims of this thesis were to determine whether the behavior of North Bay Beach can be described by a morphodynamic model, and whether variability alongshore at North Bay Beach is explained by morphodynamics. Aims were achieved by specific measurement and observation of the process environment, beach profiles, and <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> of North Bay Beach, Kaikoura. Methods include littoral environment observations (LEOs), beach profile surveys, documentation of cusp, occurrence or extinction and wavelengths, sediment sampling of cusp horns and bays, and the compilation of wind and weather data. Morphodynamic beach state was indicated by way of a surf scaling factor. Results indicate a relationship between <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> and wave approach, explicable by the edge wave theory utilized by morphodynamics. Beach profile results show North Bay Beach as morphodynamically reflective - reflecting rather than dissipating wave energy at the shore. Surf scaling factor analysis indicates that North Bay Beach experiences intermediate morphodynamic beach states as well, although this is not reflected in the morphology of the beach as a whole as the model predicts. Due to these inconsistencies, the specific morphodynamics model presented proved inconclusive. However, it is clear that North Bay Beach is more reflective than it is dissipative. On this point, the conceptual basis of morphodynamics proved appropriate. It provided a link between the known morphology, sediment, and morphological responses of North Bay Beach, and the lesser known, difficult to measure, process environment. However, the morphodynamic model needs "fine tuning", i. e. possibly more defined beach states in the sequence to adapt highly reflective, mixed sand and gravel beaches such as North Bay Beach...|$|E

40|$|A {{system of}} shallow water {{equations}} and a bed evolution equation {{are used to}} examine the evolution of perturbations on an erodible, initially plane beach subject to normal wave incidence. Both a permeable (under Darcy's law) and an impermeable beach are considered. It is found that alongshore-periodic morphological features reminiscent of swash <b>beach</b> <b>cusps</b> form after a number of incident wave periods on both beaches. On the permeable (impermeable) beach these patterns are accretional (erosional). In both cases flow is ‘horn divergent’. Spacings of the cusps are consistent with observations, and are close to those provided by a standing synchronous linear edge wave. An analysis of the processes leading to bed change is presented. Two physical mechanisms are identified: concentration gradient and flow divergence, which are dominant in the lower and upper swash respectively, and their difference over a wave cycle leads to erosion or deposition on an impermeable beach. Infiltration enters this balance in the upper swash. A bed wave of elevation is shown to advance up the beach {{at the tip of the}} uprush, with a smaller wave of depression on the backwash. It is found that cusp horns can grow by a positive feedback mechanism stemming from decreased (increased) backwash on positive (negative) bed perturbations. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Beaches and {{barrier islands}} are {{vulnerable}} to extreme storm events, such as hurricanes, that can cause severe erosion and overwash to the system. Having dunes and a wide beach in front of coastal infrastructure can provide protection during a storm, but the influence that nearshore bathymetric features have in protecting the beach and barrier island system is not completely understood. The spatial variation in nearshore features, such as sand bars and <b>beach</b> <b>cusps,</b> can alter nearshore hydrodynamics, including wave setup and runup. The influence of bathymetric features on long-wave runup {{can be used in}} evaluating the vulnerability of coastal regions to erosion and dune overtopping, evaluating the changing morphology, and implementing plans to protect infrastructure. In this thesis, long-wave runup variation due to changing bathymetric features as determined with the numerical model XBeach is quantified (eXtreme Beach behavior model). Wave heights are analyzed to determine the energy through the surfzone. XBeach assumes that coastal erosion at the land-sea interface is dominated by bound long-wave processes. Several hydrodynamic conditions are used to force the numerical model. The XBeach simulation results suggest that bathymetric irregularity induces significant changes in the extreme long-wave runup at the beach and the energy indicator through the surfzone...|$|E
