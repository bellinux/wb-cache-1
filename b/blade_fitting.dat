50|$|There are 2 main {{types of}} <b>blade</b> <b>fitting</b> in use. The older type uses a screw {{to hold the}} blade; the newer type slots in.|$|E
50|$|Sixteen {{spearhead}}s, {{a dagger}} and eight arrowheads were also found. One spearhead generated special interest {{because it was}} bimetallic, with an iron <b>blade</b> <b>fitting</b> into a bronze socket.|$|E
50|$|The clicker's knife {{regularly}} needed sharpening, {{which was}} done with an implement called a rap stick.To use a rap stick, a right-handed operator would hold it in the left hand, resting the stick on the workbench for support, stroking the blade rapidly but gently {{back and forth on}} the abrasive surface to maintain a sharp edge whilst hand-cutting, in a similar fashion to a butcher's knife and sharpening steel. The knife blade shown is a lighter medical item but approximates the shape of a clicker's knife <b>blade,</b> <b>fitting</b> into a comfortable wooden handle with screw-activated jaws. The main surface is emery cloth wrapped over the edge to form a round section where the curved blade can nestle and be sharpened; the top edge is sharper and square in cross-section, with a fine-grain aluminium oxide abrasive strip used for tip-sharpening. On the reverse side is a heavy-leather smooth strop, to address any metal burrs left by the abrasive process.|$|E

50|$|Since the Tuareg have {{an aversion}} to {{touching}} iron, the takoba's hilt, like many iron implements, is fully covered. Typically the simple but deep crossguard is of iron sheet, or iron-framed wood, covered in tooled leather, and occasionally sheathed in brass or silver; the grip is also often leather-covered but the pommel is always of metal, often brass or copper, sometimes iron or silver. Alternatively the whole hilt can be covered in brass or silver sheathing. The scabbard is made of elaborately tooled leather. Geographical variations {{in the form of}} the hilt have been noted, but no rigorous typology has been established. Variations in the quality of <b>blade</b> and <b>fittings</b> on takobas probably mostly reflect the wealth of their owners.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With the {{development}} of aero manufacturing, turbine blade is required to be reconstructed quickly and accurately. Precise description is the premise for turbine blade machining. In order to model the <b>blade</b> accurately, a <b>fitting</b> algorithm {{based on the principle}} of least square and polar line properties of ellipse is presented to extract the important parameters of leading edge and trailing edge. Validation with experimental results demonstrates the accuracy and the robustness of this parameters extraction method...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{under way}} on two {{concepts}} for producing a turbine rotor with ceramic blades and superalloy disks are discussed. One concept employs hot-pressed silicon nitride blades and a compliant interlayer at the <b>blade</b> root end <b>fitting</b> whereas the second concept {{relies on a}} superplastic plastic forging technique to attach ceramic blades to the metal disk. This latter concept has been hot spin tested at 2250 F and 45, 000 RPM for 50 hours in a vacuum spin pit. The fully bladed (30 blades) rotor survived this major test...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This work {{concerns}} the root-cause {{investigation of the}} blade damage in a steam turbine bladed disk of a thermoelectric power plant. The purpose of this work is to investigate the low cycle fatigue problem by determining the natural frequencies and the associated modes of vibrations of a bladed disk and comparing with the operational rotation of the turbine and its harmonics. The bladed disk is an assembly of several blades grouped and each group is an assembly {{of four or five}} blades, connected by elements named shroud and tie-wire. The computational model of a single blade and of a <b>blades</b> grouped are <b>fitting</b> by modal analysis measurements. Finally, a numerical modal analysis is made on a complete bladed disk in order to investigate the low cycle fatigue problem...|$|R
40|$|Based on Bezier curve, {{experimental}} design theory, and response surface method, the optimization design method for turbine blades is established. The turbine of turbodrill tested {{on the bench}} is taken for an example, and the numerical simulation model is established using third-order Bezier curve <b>fitting</b> <b>blade</b> surfaces. The model is then verified by test experiment data of the turbine bench and proven to be reliable. The blade structure parameters are defined as independent variables, and the maximum efficiency {{is defined as the}} objective function. Based on the simulation results by the computational fluid dynamics, first the significant impacts on the blade profile parameters are filtered out by seven times in single-factor sensitive analysis, and then the relationship between the objective function and independent variables is obtained by using the Box–Behnken design and response surface methodology. Moreover, the regression equation of turbine efficiency and blade structure parameters is built, and the interaction effects between the parameters are analyzed. Numerical simulations on three selected groups of optimum combination show that computational fluid dynamics simulations are in good accordance with the calculations based on response surface method; furthermore, compared with the reference model, the performance of the optimized model is significantly improved, of which efficiency can be increased by more than 10 %. This study can provide a new perspective and basis for the design and optimization of the turbodrill blades...|$|R
