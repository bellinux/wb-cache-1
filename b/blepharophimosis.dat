5000|$|<b>Blepharophimosis</b> {{syndrome}} is an autosomal dominant characterized by <b>blepharophimosis</b> (horizontal shortening of the palpebral fissures), ptosis (upper eyelid drooping, usually with {{the characteristics of}} congenital ptosis), epicanthus inversus (skin folds by the nasal bridge, more prominent lower than upper lid), and telecanthus (widening of {{the distance between the}} medial orbital walls). This {{syndrome is}} caused by mutations in the FOXL2 gene, either with premature ovarian failure (BPES type I) or without (BPES type II). [...] It may also be associated with lop ears, ectropion, hypoplasia of superior orbital rims, and hypertelorism.|$|E
50|$|Marden-Walker {{syndrome}} (MWS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} congenital disorder. It is characterized by <b>blepharophimosis,</b> microcephaly, micrognathia, multiple joint contractures, arachnodactyly, camptodactyly, kyphoscoliosis, and delayed motor development and {{is often associated with}} cystic dysplastic kidneys, dextrocardia, Dandy-Walker malformation, and agenesis of corpus callosum".|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} 30 cases of Marden-Walker Syndrome {{reported}} since 1966.

5000|$|Klein made {{contributions}} {{towards the}} understanding of Waardenburg syndrome, or more fully, the [...] "van der Hoeve-Halbertsma-Waardenburg-Klein syndrome". In August 1947 Klein presented a deaf mute child, who was 10 years of age, and had partial albinism of the hair and body, blue hypoplastic irides, <b>blepharophimosis</b> and malformation of arms, to the Swiss Society of Genetics, and gave a full report of his findings in 1950.|$|E
50|$|This intronless gene encodes {{a member}} of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family of {{transcription}} factors involved in the regulation of embryonic development and in the determination of the cell fate. The encoded protein may act as a transcriptional regulator after forming a protein complex with other proteins. Mutations in this gene are suggested to be responsible for the limb defects associated with <b>blepharophimosis,</b> ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) and Mobius syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Other {{symptoms}} include transient hypothyroidism, macular degeneration and torticollis. The condition {{was discovered in}} 1987 and the name arose from the individuals who first reported the syndrome. An individual with YSS has been identified with having symptoms to a similar syndrome known as Ohdo <b>Blepharophimosis</b> syndrome, showing that it is quite difficult to diagnose the correct condition based on the symptoms present. Some doctors therefore consider these syndromes to be the same.|$|E
50|$|The most {{prominent}} symptoms of BPES are horizontally narrow eyes (<b>blepharophimosis),</b> drooping eyelids (ptosis), and a fold of skin {{running from the}} side of the nose to the lower eyelid (epicanthus inversus). Other common symptoms include lack of an eyelid fold, widely spaced eyes (telecanthus), low nose bridge, and ear malformations (including cupping and incomplete development). Rare symptoms include microphthalmos (abnormally small eyes), tear ducts in the wrong location, and high arched palate. Female infertility can occur with type I BPES.|$|E
50|$|The {{natural history}} of MWS is not well known: many {{patients}} died in infancy and clinical follow-up {{has been reported in}} few surviving adults. However, diagnosis may be more difficult to establish in adults patients, such as: <b>blepharophimosis,</b> contractures, growth retardation, and developmental delay, whereas minor face anomalies are less noticeable as the patient grows older. Throughout the development of the patient from young child to older adult changes the behavior drastically, from kindness to restless and hyperactive to aggressive.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the signs}} of MWS are present during the {{neonatal}} period. The most common signs at this state are multiple congenital joint contractures, dysmorphic features with mask-like face, <b>blepharophimosis,</b> ptosis, micrognathia, cleft or high arched palate, low-set ears, arachnodactyly, chest deformation as pectus, kyphoscoliosis and absent deep tendon reflexes are frequent minor malformations have also been described and consist of renal anomalies, cardiovascular abnormalities, hypospadias, omphalomesenteric duct, hypertriphic pyloric stenosis, duodenal bands, hyoplastic right lower lobe of the lung, displacement of the larynx {{to the right and}} vertebral abnormalities, cerebral malformations.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in {{this gene}} are {{a cause of}} <b>blepharophimosis</b> {{syndrome}} and/or premature ovarian failure 3.Predicting the occurrence of POF based {{on the nature of}} the missense mutations in FOXL2 was a medical challenge. However, a correlation between the transcriptional activity of FOXL2 variants and the type of BPES has been founded.Moreover by studying the effects of natural and artificial mutations in the forkhead domain of FOXL2, a clear correlation between the orientation of amino-acid side chains in the DNA-binding domain and transcriptional activity is founded, providing the first (in silico) predictive tool of the effects of FOXL2 missense mutations.|$|E
50|$|In 1913, Jan van der Hoeve {{observed}} and described a lateral {{position of the}} lacrimal points and shortened eyelid slit in identical deaf mute twins. In August 1947 David Klein presented a deaf mute child, who was 10 years of age, and had partial albinism of the hair and body, blue hypoplastic rides, <b>blepharophimosis,</b> and malformation of the arms, to the Swiss Society of Genetics, and gave a full report of his findings in 1950. Waardenburg gave an account of a deaf adult with similar facial features in December 1948, followed by a detailed review in 1951. He described the syndrome as a distinct entity and found the anomalies in 12 of 840 deaf mutes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Blepharophimosis</b> {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} anomaly of the palpebral fissure which {{is often associated with}} mental retardation and additional malformations. We report on a boy with <b>blepharophimosis,</b> ptosis and severe mental retardation carrying an unbalanced 4; 10 translocation with terminal duplication of 10 q [dup(10) (q 25. 1 [...] >qter) ] and monosomy of a small terminal segment of chromosome 4 q [del(4) (34. 3 [...] >qter) ]. Detailed clinical examination and review of the literature showed that the phenotype of the patient was mainly determined by the dup(10 q). This paper reviews the chromosomal aberrations associated with BMR (<b>blepharophimosis</b> mental retardation) phenotypes. Searching different databases and reviewing the literature revealed 14 microscopically visible aberrations (among them UPD(14) pat) and two submicroscopic rearrangements causing <b>blepharophimosis</b> and mental retardation (BMR) syndrome. Some of these rearrangements-like the terminal dup(10 q) identified in our patient or interstitial del(2 q) -are associated with clearly defined phenotypes and can be well distinguished from each other on basis of clinical examination. This paper should assist clinicians and cytogeneticists when evaluating patients with BMR syndrome...|$|E

40|$|<b>Blepharophimosis</b> ptosis epicanthus inversus {{syndrome}} (BPES) is {{a complex}} eyelid malformation characterized by the classical tetrad of <b>blepharophimosis,</b> telecanthus, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus.

We describe a case of BPES with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, a neurocristopathy characterized by maldevelopment of the anterior segment with predisposition to development of glaucoma.

40|$|PURPOSE: Schwartz-Jampel {{syndrome}} is a disorder of continuous myotonia causing blepharospasm, acquired ptosis, and <b>blepharophimosis.</b> We report {{the management of}} the associated eyelid anomalies with orbicularis oculi myectomy, levator aponeurosis resection, and lateral canthopexy. METHODS: Interventional case reports. Two patients with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome presented with blepharospasm, acquired ptosis, and <b>blepharophimosis.</b> Orbicularis myectomy, levator aponeurosis resection, and lateral canthopexy were performed to relieve the blepharospasm and to correct the ptosis and <b>blepharophimosis.</b> RESULTS: Significant functional and cosmetic improvements were achieved by increasing the palpebral fissure height and length while greatly decreasing the blepharospasm of the patients. No recurrence of the blepharospasm or eyelid anomalies has been noted after 1 and 15 years of follow-up, respectively. CONCLUSION: the blepharospasm and eyelid alterations caused by Schwartz-Jampel syndrome should be treated to provide functional and cosmetic improvements. Our technique of myectomy, levator resection, and lateral canthopexy provides an excellent, long-lasting result. (C) 2001 by Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.
