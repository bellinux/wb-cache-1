25|$|Scarring (US: Scoring) {{can occur}} if brake pads are not changed {{promptly}} {{when they reach}} the end of their service life and are considered worn out. Once enough of the friction material has worn away, the pad's steel <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> (for glued pads) or the pad retainer rivets (for riveted pads) will bear directly upon the disc's wear surface, reducing braking power and making scratches on the disc. Generally a moderately scarred / scored disc, which operated satisfactorily with existing brake pads, will be equally usable with new pads. If the scarring is deeper but not excessive, it can be repaired by machining off a layer of the disc's surface. This can only be done a limited number of times as the disc has a minimum rated safe thickness. The minimum thickness value is typically cast into the disc during manufacturing on the hub or the edge of the disc. In Pennsylvania, which {{has one of the most}} rigorous auto safety inspection programs in North America, an automotive disc cannot pass safety inspection if any scoring is deeper than , and must be replaced if machining will reduce the disc below its minimum safe thickness.|$|E
25|$|The {{plunge depth}} {{is defined as}} the depth of the lowest point of the {{shoulder}} {{below the surface of the}} welded plate and has been found to be a critical parameter for ensuring weld quality. Plunging the shoulder below the plate surface increases the pressure below the tool and helps ensure adequate forging of the material at the rear of the tool. Tilting the tool by 2–4 degrees, such that the rear of the tool is lower than the front, has been found to assist this forging process. The plunge depth needs to be correctly set, both to ensure the necessary downward pressure is achieved and to ensure that the tool fully penetrates the weld. Given the high loads required, the welding machine may deflect and so reduce the plunge depth compared to the nominal setting, which may result in flaws in the weld. On the other hand, an excessive plunge depth may result in the pin rubbing on the <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> surface or a significant undermatch of the weld thickness compared to the base material. Variable load welders have been developed to automatically compensate for changes in the tool displacement while TWI have demonstrated a roller system that maintains the tool position above the weld plate.|$|E

In this model {{the rotation of the}} tool draws little or no material around the front of the probe instead the material parts in front of the pin and passes down either side. After the material has passed the probe [...] the side pressure exerted by the [...] "die" [...] forces the material back together and consolidation of the join occurs as the rear of the tool shoulder passes overhead and the large down force forges the material.|$|E

40|$|B. Schlegel, K. Wiebusch, 2 ̆ 6 S. Otto, PhD, Gustavus Adolphus College, St. Peter, MN In {{recent years}} {{starting}} block platforms in swimming have been modified {{to include an}} adjustable <b>back</b> <b>plate,</b> which has drawn the attention of some researchers. Beretić, Đurović, and Okičić (2012) reported that the kick-start {{with the use of}} the <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> resulted in a significantly faster ten-meter swim time (p= 0. 04) compared to a traditional track start without a <b>back</b> <b>plate.</b> The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of adding a <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> to the platform of a starting block in swimming on reaction and 12. 5 -yard swim time. This study included male and female athletes from a Division III swim team. A one-sample design was used. Subjects were allowed time to familiarize themselves with both styles of starting block. They then performed three starts followed by a 12. 5 -yard freestyle swim using the <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> style and three using the traditional platform style in a randomized sequence. The average of each block style was calculated and used for analysis. The independent variable was the starting block style. The dependent variables were reaction time and 12. 5 -yard swim time. Two paired sample t-tests were used to compare the difference in reaction and 12. 5 -yard swim time between the two starts. Significance was determined at the p ≤. 025 level controlling for Familywise error rate due to the multiple t-tests needed. Results revealed that there was not a significant difference in reaction time between starting block style at the p≤ 0. 025, t (24) = 1. 955, p = 0. 063. The results indicated a statistically significant difference in 12. 5 -yard time at the p ≤. 025 for the start with the <b>back</b> <b>plate,</b> t (24) = 9. 98, p = 0. 000. The mean score for the <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> reaction time (0. 429 ± 0. 109) was not significantly less than the mean score for the traditional starting block reaction time (0. 464 ± 0. 099). The mean score for the 12. 5 -yard swim time from the <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> (4. 823 ±. 388) was significantly less than the mean 12. 5 -yard swim time from the traditional starting block (4. 972 ±. 399). In conclusion, this study may suggest that a <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> could be utilized to improve reaction time and 12. 5 -yard swim time for collegiate swimmers. Future research might look at force generated from different starting style. IRB# 1314 - 0265. NACSM Professional Sponsor: Stephanie Ott...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> {{provides}} {{a base for}} the other components. The back plate also increases the rigidity of whole set-up, supports the housing, and protects it from foreign materials like dust and other road debris. It absorbs the torque from the braking action, {{and that is why}} back plate is also called the [...] "Torque Plate". Since all braking operations exert pressure on the <b>backing</b> <b>plate,</b> it must be strong and wear-resistant. Levers for emergency or parking brakes, and automatic brake-shoe adjuster were also added in recent years.|$|E

40|$|Cooling in a {{centrifugal}} compressor {{can improve the}} performance and reduce the impeller temperature. In a {{centrifugal compressor}}, external walls can be cool down, which {{is known as the}} shell cooling. This method avoids undesirable effects induced by other cooling methods. Cooling can be applied on different external walls, such as the shroud, diffuser or the <b>back</b> <b>plate.</b> This paper focuses on seeking the most effective cooling place to increase the performance and reduce the impeller temperature. It is found that shroud cooling improves the compressor performance the most. Shroud cooling with 2400 W of cooling power increases the pressure ratio by 4. 6 % and efficiency by 1. 49 %. Each 500 W increase in the shroud cooling power, increases the efficiency by 0. 3 %. Diffuser cooling and <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> cooling have an identical effect on the polytropic efficiency. However, <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> cooling increases the pressure ratio more than diffuser cooling. Furthermore, only <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> cooling reduces the impeller temperature, and with 2400 W of cooling power, the impeller temperature reduces by 45 K...|$|R
