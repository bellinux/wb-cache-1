5|$|In 1992 {{the sons}} of Miguel Vázquez were {{introduced}} to the wrestling world as Espanto IV and Espanto V, forming a regular tag team in and around Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. The duo lost their masks to the team of <b>Blue</b> <b>Fish</b> and Mongol Chino, although the team of Stuka and Stuka Jr. is also credited with unmasking them. It is possible that Espanto IV and V agreed to lose their masks to both teams, but in different locations in Mexico. Before the internet there were examples of luchadors getting an additional payment for losing their mask on multiple occasions. The brothers have worked for various Mexican promotions and toured Japan while working for the Japanese Universal Wrestling Federation and Michinoku Pro. In Japan they unsuccessfully challenged the Great Sasuke and Gran Hamada for the UWA/UWF Intercontinental Tag Team Championship.|$|E

25|$|Geisel wrote {{more than}} 60 books {{over the course}} of his long career. Most were {{published}} under his well-known pseudonym Dr. Seuss, though he also authored more than a dozen books as Theo LeSieg and one as Rosetta Stone. His books have topped many bestseller lists, sold over 600 million copies, and been translated into more than 20 languages. In 2000, Publishers Weekly compiled a list of the best-selling children's books of all time; of the top 100 hardcover books, 16 were written by Geisel, including Green Eggs and Ham, at number 4, The Cat in the Hat, at number 9, and One Fish Two Fish Red Fish <b>Blue</b> <b>Fish,</b> at number 13. In the years after his death in 1991, two additional books were published based on his sketches and notes: Hooray for Diffendoofer Day! and Daisy-Head Mayzie. My Many Colored Days was originally written in 1973 but was posthumously published in 1996. In September 2011, seven stories originally published in magazines during the 1950s were released in a collection titled The Bippolo Seed and Other Lost Stories.|$|E

500|$|Atheneum Books for Young Readers reissued {{a revised}} version of the book in 2009. The story was {{shortened}} by cutting some descriptive passages and allowing the illustrations to convey the setting. Calpurnia's final poem was also eliminated. New illustrations in acrylics were created by Leo and Diane Dillon, {{who went on to}} win two Caldecott Awards. Unlike the more realistic illustrations by Weisgard, the Dillons emphasized the magical reality of the story, as in the cover picture, where Calpurnia's profile is almost hidden inside a stylized <b>blue</b> <b>fish.</b> Mary Harris Russell, writing for The Chicago Tribune, felt modern audiences would appreciate the way [...] "the fantasy side to this land of cypress trees and silent rivers is amplified and contrasted with the realistic background of little Calpurnia's life." [...] The Dillon's version of The Secret River received one of two honorable mentions in the fiction category of the 2012 BolognaRagazzi Awards, an international children's book award that honors the art and design of illustrated books worldwide. In the words of the Bologna jury, [...] "It is only fitting that Marjorie Rawlings, the great American writer loved by so many generations of readers, is finally paid such a refined and sensitive tribute." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode name is {{a parody}} of One Fish Two Fish Red Fish <b>Blue</b> <b>Fish</b> by Dr. Seuss. [...] The sushi bar that the Simpson family visits is located on a street called Elm Street, a {{reference}} to the A Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise. While waiting for Homer to finish his meal at the sushi bar, Bart and Lisa sneak into the bar's karaoke room and sing the theme song to the 1971 film Shaft, [...] "Theme from Shaft" [...] by Isaac Hayes. In the karaoke room, a gentleman introduces himself as Richie Sakai, a reference to a producer on The Simpsons with the same name. He proceeds to sing the 1971 song [...] "Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves" [...] by Cher. Homer sings his own version of the gospel hymn [...] "When the Saints Go Marching In" [...] while listening to Lisa playing her saxophone one last time. When Homer arrives at his home after leaving Moe's Tavern, he hammers on one of the windows of the house and shouts Marge's name. This is {{a reference to the}} 1967 film The Graduate, in which Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) does the same and runs to the church, pounds on the window, and yells [...] "Elaine! Elaine!" [...] As Homer awaits his death, he listens to Larry King read the Bible on tape.|$|E
500|$|On April 20, 1997, Espanto VI and Espanto V lost a Luchas de Apuestas, or [...] "bet match", to {{the team}} of Takeda and Maravilloso. As {{a result of the}} loss Espanto IV and V were both forced to take their mask off {{in the middle of the}} ring. While they unmasked and {{revealed}} their birth names, no record of their actual names have been found. The duo was later involved in controversy as they lost their masks twice more in Luchas de Apuestas matches, the second time {{to the team}} of <b>Blue</b> <b>Fish</b> and Mongol Chino in Monterrey and then a third time to the brother-team of Stuka and Stuka Jr. in Gomez Palacio, Durango. Lucha libre has strong rules in place around Luchas de Apuestas matches that normally does not allow wrestlers to wear their mask again after losing a Lucha de Apuestas match. In the pre-internet days wrestling results from the independent circuit was often not reported outside of the state, allowing Espanto IV and Espanto V to lose their masks three times in a short period of time without the various wrestling commissions or fans being aware of this. Over time wrestling commissions in the different states did discover the blatant violation of their rules and the state of Nuevo Leon barred them from wrestling there for two years for the infraction.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1954, Life {{magazine}} {{published a}} report on illiteracy among school children which concluded that children were not learning to read because their books were boring. William Ellsworth Spaulding {{was the director of}} the education division at Houghton Mifflin (he later became its chairman), and he compiled a list of 348 words that he felt were important for first-graders to recognize. He asked Geisel to cut the list to 250 words and to write a book using only those words. Spaulding challenged Geisel to [...] "bring back a book children can't put down". Nine months later, Geisel completed The Cat in the Hat, using 236 of the words given to him. It retained the drawing style, verse rhythms, and all the imaginative power of Geisel's earlier works but, because of its simplified vocabulary, it could be read by beginning readers. The Cat in the Hat and subsequent books written for young children achieved significant international success and they remain very popular today. In 2009, Green Eggs and Ham sold 540,366 copies, The Cat in the Hat sold 452,258 copies, and One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, <b>Blue</b> <b>Fish</b> (1960) sold 409,068 copies—outselling the majority of newly published children's books.|$|E

He {{has been in}} many lands; he has eaten back-hendl at Vienna and kulibatsch at St. Petersburg; he has {{had the courage to}} face the buffalo veal of Roumania and to dine with a German family at one o'clock; he has serious views on the right method of cooking those famous white {{truffles}} of Turin of which Alexandre Dumas was so fond; and, {{in the face of the}} Oriental Club, declares that Bombay curry is better than the curry of Bengal. In fact he seems to have had experience of almost every kind of meal except the 'square meal' of the Americans. This he should study at once; there is a great field for the philosophic epicure in the United States. Boston beans may be dismissed at once as delusions, but soft-shell crabs, terrapin, canvas-back ducks, <b>blue</b> <b>fish</b> and the pompono of New Orleans are all wonderful delicacies, particularly when one gets them at Delmonico's.
