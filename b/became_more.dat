A study from Harvard professor Michael Luca analyzed 316,415 reviews in Boston and found that fake reviews rose from 6% of the site's reviews in 2006 to 20% in 2014. Yelp's own review filter identifies 25% of reviews as suspicious.|$|E

50|$|Unlike tree {{traversal}}, graph traversal {{may require}} that some vertices be visited more than once, {{since it is}} not necessarily known before transitioning to a vertex that it has already been explored.

5|$|The oceans {{may have}} become more hospitable to life over the last 500million years and less {{vulnerable}} to mass extinctions: dissolved oxygen <b>became</b> <b>more</b> widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of eutrophication and anoxic events; marine ecosystems <b>became</b> <b>more</b> diversified so that food chains {{were less likely to}} be disrupted.|$|E

5|$|Weber also {{proposed}} a socioevolutionary model of religious change, showing that in general, societies {{have moved from}} magic to polytheism, then to pantheism, monotheism and finally, ethical monotheism. According to Weber, this evolution occurred as the growing economic stability allowed professionalisation {{and the evolution of}} ever more sophisticated priesthood. As societies grew more complex and encompassed different groups, a hierarchy of gods developed and as power in the society <b>became</b> <b>more</b> centralised, the concept of a single, universal God <b>became</b> <b>more</b> popular and desirable.|$|E

5|$|After being {{classified}} as a hurricane, Karl gradually strengthened, and its circulation <b>became</b> <b>more</b> distinguished from the surrounding cloudiness. A trough that emerged from North America steered the hurricane eastward, and on November 26, it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a central barometric pressure reading of 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg). Karl maintained this strength for approximately 18 hours until beginning to weaken slightly as it accelerated towards the northeast. On November 27, the storm's eye <b>became</b> <b>more</b> ragged as the cyclone passed within 230miles (370km) of the Azores and started {{to show signs of}} deterioration. The trough over the North Atlantic developed into the dominant low pressure area, and Karl turned northward around its periphery. It merged with another approaching system and was declared dissipated by November 28.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Argentina from Europe, Evita never again appeared in public with the complicated hairdos of her movie star days. The brilliant gold color <b>became</b> <b>more</b> subdued in tone, {{and even the}} style changed, her hair being pulled back severely into a heavy braided chignon. Additionally, her extravagant clothing <b>became</b> <b>more</b> refined after the tour. No longer did she wear the elaborate hats and form-fitting dresses of Argentine designers. Soon she adopted simpler and more fashionable Paris couture and became particularly attached to the fashions of Christian Dior and the jewels of Cartier. In an attempt to cultivate a more serious political persona, Eva {{began to appear in}} public wearing conservative though stylish tailleurs (a business-like combination of skirts and jackets), which also were made by Dior and other Paris couture houses.|$|E
