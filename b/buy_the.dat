Malmö FF early expressed their desire to <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> stocks of Peab and Erling Pålsson to reduce rent on the stadium and increase profits. On 27 April 2012, {{it was announced that}} Malmö FF were close to buying the full 25% of stocks owned by Erling Pålsson and 25% of the stocks owned by Peab, increasing their own share to 75% and leaving Peab with a 25% share. On 1 May 2012, Malmö Stad granted the bailment needed for Malmö FF to <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> stocks. The deal, worth 90 million kronor, was finalised on 13 June 2012. The long-term goal for Malmö FF is to <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> remaining 25% of the stocks to fully own Swedbank Stadion.|$|E

5|$|However, his {{re-instatement}} {{was short}} lived, as the navigation ceased {{to operate in}} January 1869, the last month in which tolls were collected. Mortgages of £19,708 were outstanding, of which £2,607 dated from the original construction by Pyott. A plan to <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> waterway by J. R. Stebbings of Southampton in 1871 fell through. A further attempt to <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> navigation was made in 1909 by Patrick O'Carroll, an estate agent from Southsea.

Wary of {{directing}} two horror films in a row, Whale instead convinced Laemmle to <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> rights to a mystery novel called The Hangover Murders. Whale argued that {{the same sort of}} audiences who went to horror films also went to mystery films and pointed to the hit Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film The Thin Man as evidence that a picture based on the novel would be a success. Laemmle agreed to <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> rights for $5,000, only after extracting a promise from Whale that he would direct Dracula's Daughter next.|$|E

5|$|A {{country with}} a large trade surplus would {{generally}} see {{the value of its}} currency appreciate relative to other currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases. This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to <b>buy</b> <b>the</b> exporting country's currency used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments.|$|E

He painted at least two further versions for private sale.|$|E
