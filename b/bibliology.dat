40|$|The {{issue that}} is {{the main focus of}} this paper has not been of great {{interest}} to <b>bibliology</b> scholars. Even though one version of the Brest Bible, marked as B, was described quite thoroughly by Feliks Bentkowski already two hundred years ago, catalogue descriptions have until today been based upon the scheme formulated by Karol Estreicher Sr. He identified three versions of the Brest Bible, which differ only in the title page. The fact is, there are only two versions A and B in existence, which differ in the first quire or (very rarely) in the first two quires. The quires of version B were established to have been printed in the 1580 s or 1590 s in Jan Karcan’s press in Vilnius. Apparently, a certain number of the Old Testament quires A-Y were typeset and printed in Brest in 1563. There is only one extant complete copy of it with the newly printed quires, whereas in the remaining dozen or so copies that have survived it is only one, or rarely, two quires, and sometimes only single sheets. The search for the Bible versions also made it possible to compile a list of 135 copies of the Brest Bible stored today in public, monastic and church collections in Europe and North America...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{theology}} of the leader of Anglican evangelicalism, John Stott. Throughout this study of evangelical identity, the relationship between the objective belief and the subjective experience is a main thread. An attempt at definition of the Anglican evangelicalism: Theologically, evangelicalism means that the <b>bibliology</b> and the doctrine of salvation have been in the foreground. Evangelical belief is moving between a doctrinal and an experiential pole, but also between a conservative and a liberal pole. The message of salvation: The issue of salvation plays a central role in Stott’s theology. The foundation for his soteriology is Christology. This summarises the objective and the subjective. Our investigation has shown that Christ’s resurrection is, for John Stott, a bridge between the objective and the subjective. In the subjective experience there is an objective element, since the faith is centered on what Christ has done. His interpretation of the atonement stresses the objective, that is, it places salvation in history, outside of man’s subjective experience. Actually, Stott sees three steps – an objective, historical event, described in the Bible, to be experienced today. The authority of the message of salvation: For Stott the revelation has a cognitive side. The Bible records historical events, but it also gives them a divine interpretation. Stott does not accept a situation where a matter will be seen as true in a religious experience, but as false in an objective reality. For Stott, God revealed in Christ is the supreme authority. The Bible should therefore be read for the purpose of salvation and with Christ as a hermeneutic principle. Stott’s <b>bibliology</b> is by himself described as established with belief in Christ as a presupposition. The message of salvation contextualized: Stott wishes to combine the objective and the subjective interpretation in order to achieve a better contextualization but throughout all of this thesis it is made evident that Stott’s view on subjectivity is rather cautious and guarded. He refuses to accept that the Bible is defined, in an absolute way, by culture in its contents and its truth. Stott’s intention has been to point to the constant factor in the teaching of the Bible. It is quite clear that Stott does not deviate from the view that the content of the evangelical doctrine is an obligation. A critical evangelical perspective on the theology of John Stott: For Stott, faith is not only belief in the Bible, but also trust in the Saviour. However, the criterion of truth in its modernistic form brought Stott to a rational theology that {{did not want to see}} Christian theology as a subjective undertaking, but as being founded in an objective, historical belief. In the final chapter Stott’s theological inheritance has been assessed and criticised from the point of view of a rising evangelical and pentecostal theology that more manifestly seeks integration. The difference is that Stott has been influenced by the dualistic view of modernity, while the integrative theology attempts to assert evangelical interests in the face of post-modernism. By evangelical standards, Stott was a competent theologian during a couple of crucial decades. He tried to attain sensitivity for certain complicated sections in theology, and he also emphasised the rational feature. However, Stott was not capable of, or interested in, leading evangelical theology into altered cultural and theological circumstances...|$|E
40|$|Lev Vladimirov (1912 – 1999) {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous and most {{prolific}} representatives of librarianship, <b>bibliology</b> and information sciences, the founder of the before mentioned spheres in Lithuania. The article focuses on the development of L. Vladimirov’s multidimensional interests, the priorities and interelations, mainly focusing on his works in book science. Biographical research helps reveal the circumstances that influenced L. Vladimirov’s work and attidude, as well as helps name the fundamental stages of his work. Much attention is paid to his family as one of the crucial elements that developed his personality and social skills. The prevailing values in the family predetermined the scholar’s social, political attitudes and models of behaviour. L. Vladimirov’s biography is analysed since the very childhood in the bookish people family, the questions of origin and identity are raised, the importance of education in interwar Lithuania in Siauliai German Progymnasium (1923 – 1928), in Silute Herder’s Real Gymnasium (1928 – 1932) and studies inKaunas Vytautas Magnum and Vilnius Universities (1932 – 1940) are assessed. The stages of scientific and professional work are discussed – starting from the beginning to work at Vilnius University in 1948, L. Vladimirov, while supervising the library of the university, trained and educated specialists and staff of librarianship. The job in Vilnius University and its library was a possibility for L. Vladimirov to start works in librarianship, take interest in ancient books, Lithuanian culture, its heritage and place in the world context. In 1964 – 1970 L. Vladimirov lead Dag HammarskjöldLibrary of United Nations in New York, took part in International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) works. While working in the library he had an opportunity to apply to the sources of book origin that were hardly available in Lithuania. New experience inspired new directions in scientific researches – the publications on book futurology and researches of the book significance in information technology system appeared. L. Vladimirov’s biography research was aimed at joining the biography periods and facts into one entity, at correcting some misguided facts, restoring the picture of the circumstances that influenced his works and attitude. The research is significant while assessing L. Vladimirov’s contribution and importance in the context of Lithuanian book science school...|$|E
40|$|Some {{people view}} {{theology}} books, especially systematic theologies, {{as an alternative}} to sleeping pills. To those who suffer from such a terrible miscon-ception this book offers something new in it's methodology. Lewis and Demarest, both professors of systematic theology at Denver Seminary in the United States, have developed a new approach to studying theology. Gordon Lewis {{is the author of the}} well known book, Decide for Yourself: A Theological Workbook, and the conception of that small book is expanded and enriched in this volume. This is the first volume of a projected three volumes series. I will first review the content of the book and then the methodology it uses. This initial volume covers the standard subjects of <b>bibliology</b> and theology proper. There are no unusual conclusions in these sections. The authors believe that general reve-lation is not salviftc, and that special revelation was progressive but not bound by time, so that it speaks to all cultures and ages. They also hold that the Bible is verbally inspired and inerrant in all that it affirms. The second half of the book deals with the character of God, the Trinity and the providence of God. The chapter on the Trinity is exceptional for carefully defining the oneness of God and giving illustrations of oneness that included diversity, such as the nation Israel, the tabernacle and marriage. The authors believe that God has predestined some to salvation but they reject the view that others are predes-tined to eternal death. The reader would be advised, however, to have a good dictionary nearby, since words such as 'ectypal', 'aseity ' or 'immanental ' occur with regularity. While the conclusions that the authors draw in each chapter are not revolu-tionary, their methodology is certainly unique. The first chapter of the book explains what they mean by 'integrative theology'. The three volumes are meant to draw together the disciplines of biblical theology, historical theology, apologetics and practical theology, and to apply them to each topic. The format for each chapter is as follows. First, the problem is identified and defmed and its significance shown. Then various answers to the problem ar...|$|E
