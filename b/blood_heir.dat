50|$|Tui is {{the only}} <b>blood</b> <b>heir</b> to the Chiefdom held by his father. He leaves the island when Shandala decides to go with Gabriel Dunn, and hopes to help keep her promise to return home. He is voiced by Revard Dufresne.|$|E
5000|$|When Sundjata died under mysterious {{circumstances}} in 1255 his oldest and only <b>blood</b> <b>heir</b> {{was too young}} to serve as Mansa, and Manding Bory was designated regent. Before he could ascend, his nephew seized the throne under the name Mansa Wali.|$|E
50|$|Anne Bishop is an American fantasy writer. Her most noted {{work is the}} Black Jewels series. She won the Crawford Award in 2000 for {{the first}} three Black Jewels books, {{sometimes}} called the Black Jewels trilogy: Daughter of the <b>Blood,</b> <b>Heir</b> to the Shadows, and Queen of the Darkness.|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of adopting adults, {{even if one}} has biological children, makes Japanese family firms unusually competitive. Our nearly population-wide panel of postwar listed nonfinancial firms shows inherited family firms more important in postwar Japan than generally realized, and also performing well – an unusual finding for a developed economy. Adopted heirs’ firms outperform blood heirs’ firms, and match or nearly match founder-run listed firms. Both adopted and blood heirs’ firms outperform non-family firms. Using family structure variables as instruments, we find adopted heirs “causing” elevated performance. These {{findings are consistent with}} adult adoptees displacing <b>blood</b> <b>heirs</b> in the left tail of the talent distribution, with the “adopted son” job motivating star managers, and with the threat of displacement inducing <b>blood</b> <b>heirs</b> to invest in human capital, mitigating the so-called “Carnegie conjecture” that inherited wealth deadens talent. ...|$|R
50|$|Mansa Uli Keita also {{significantly}} increased the empire's agricultural production. On {{an economic and}} political level, Uli set a precedent by making the Hajj to Mecca during his reign. Unlike his father, Mansa Wali had no <b>blood</b> <b>heirs,</b> which left the throne to be fought over by his adopted brothers. During the ensuing power struggle, Ouati Keita seized the throne, thereby again sidelining Manding Bory.|$|R
5|$|Nettlecombe {{has never}} been bought or sold. It was held before the Norman Conquest by Prince Godwine, son of King Harold. William the Conqueror assumed {{possession}} of Nettlecombe after defeating King Harold at the Battle of Hastings. In 1160, Henry II granted it to Hugh de Raleigh, and to his heirs in perpetuity. It passed to Warine de Raleigh, and on through direct <b>blood</b> <b>heirs</b> until the 19th century, a claim strengthened by marriages between deep ancestral cousins. The estate became a seat of the Trevelyan baronets (previously spelled as Trevilian), who also held another manor at Basil, by the marriage of Sir John Trevilian in 1481 to Lady Whalesborough, heiress of Nettlecombe via her Raleigh maternal line. Nettlecombe was held in continuity by Trevilian successors until the 20th century {{following the death of}} Joan Trevelyan and her husband Garnet Wolsey.|$|R
50|$|Born in 1955, Anne Bishop {{started her}} writing career by {{publishing}} short stories. She {{is best known}} for her award-winning novels, The Black Jewels Trilogy, Daughter of the <b>Blood,</b> <b>Heir</b> to the Shadows, and Queen of the Darkness. Bishop has also created The Tir Alainn Trilogy, and The Landscapes of Ephemera Series. She is currently residing in upstate New York working on The Others, her newest series. Many of her novels are also available internationally.|$|E
50|$|The Eon {{family is}} the legendary family that {{defeated}} the General. Only Eon, Marty, and his father have been mentioned, but all members are great warriors and martial artists. The General's forces wiped out the family through the years leaving Marty the sole <b>blood</b> <b>heir</b> to the family legacy. Their ancestral home is a huge fortress surrounded by bamboo forest. Underneath the home is the family's ancestral training ground that includes wood training drones and tests to hone the family's martial arts skills. The home has fallen into great disrepair {{since the death of}} Marty's father.|$|E
5000|$|Brittney Havers, a South Florida {{high school}} senior, {{lives with her}} wealthy stepfather, Niles Dunlap, after her mother ran her car off the road in [...] "Gator Alley" [...] and was presumably eaten by {{alligators}} a year earlier. When Dunlap is killed in a private plane crash, his will calls for Brittney to receive a small stipend until she finishes college, after which she will receive only $25,000 a year for life from the estate. The rest of Dunlap's assets, totaling $70 million, are {{to be left to}} a corporate trust, unless a <b>blood</b> <b>heir</b> can be found.|$|E
50|$|Later, she resurfaces {{alongside}} Nacht (now wearing armor) {{as one of}} {{the leaders}} of Axis Mundi, a resurgent fascist terrorist organization who was opposed by the New Invaders. Other members of Axis Mundi included U-Man, Baroness <b>Blood</b> (female <b>heir</b> to Baron <b>Blood)</b> and the Pterrorists, an army of cloned insectoid warriors whose mind and DNA were derived from Agent Axis.|$|R
5000|$|In 1573 the King, Charles IX, {{and nine}} princes {{of the blood}} all signed a {{declaration}} assuring Charles' brother Henry, Duke of Anjou, {{who was about to}} assume the crown of Poland, that his rights to the French throne would not lapse, nor those of any children he may have, even though they were to be born outside France. The blood right in this instance overcame the law of aubain by which foreign-born heirs forfeited their rights of succession; that is to say, being [...] "capable of the crown" [...] was a unique kind of birthright which transcended all usual legal regulations. <b>Blood</b> <b>heirs</b> no matter where they were born or resided were to be regarded [...] "tout ainsi que s'ilz estoient originaires et regnicoles." [...] This was recorded in letters patent in Parliament. Similar letters were issued for Philip, Duke of Anjou, when he was about to assume the crown of Spain (1700). But in his case, the letters were later withdrawn (1713) due to pressure from other European powers.|$|R
6000|$|Ib. sc. 2. In this, {{the first}} {{introduction}} of Falstaff, observe the consciousness and the intentionality of his wit, {{so that when}} it does not flow of its own accord, its absence is felt, and an effort visibly made to recall it. Note also throughout how Falstaff’s pride is gratified in the power of influencing a prince of the <b>blood,</b> the <b>heir</b> apparent, by means of it. Hence his dislike to Prince John of Lancaster, and his mortification when he finds his wit fail on him:— ...|$|R
50|$|Elizabeth guides Booker to the bathysphere lighthouse, {{revealing}} she can now see all possibilities {{based on}} choice {{as evidenced by}} {{an infinite number of}} lighthouses they can see. Elizabeth explains the nature of choice to Booker, revealing that Booker and Comstock are the same person: in one reality, Booker ran away from a baptism ceremony after his atrocities at the Battle of Wounded Knee, while in another, he accepted it and became the religious Comstock. Elizabeth reveals she is also Booker's daughter, Anna DeWitt, whom Booker had sold to the Lutece twins to pay off gambling debts. They in turn were working for Comstock, who needed a <b>blood</b> <b>heir</b> for Columbia, having been rendered sterile by the twins' reality-warping experiments. Booker later {{had a change of heart}} and chased down the Luteces as they stepped through a Tear, severing the tip of Elizabeth's finger which gave her the awareness of multiple realities. Elizabeth asserts that there has been an endless cycle of Bookers and Comstocks, and the only way to end this is to destroy the creation of Comstock; she takes Booker to the site of the baptism and drown Booker with the aid of dozens of other Elizabeths from other timelines. The Elizabeths begin to wink out of existence, with the game fading to black on the one throughout the game.|$|E
50|$|The first {{books in}} this series were {{featured}} on various Baen CDs. In 2010 Baen CD 23 featuring 1635: The Eastern Front included The Shadow of the Lion, A Mankind Witch, This Rough Magic, and Much Fall of <b>Blood</b> of the <b>Heirs</b> of Alexandria series among other books.|$|R
60|$|The {{first was}} Sorley Wilson, {{the son of}} the owner of the Nonpareil Coalpit. He was a young <b>blood</b> of twenty, <b>heir</b> to a fortune, a keen sportsman, and down for the Easter Vacation from Magdalene College. He sat now upon the edge of the surgery table, looking in {{thoughtful}} silence at Montgomery, and twisting the ends of his small, black, waxed moustache.|$|R
50|$|In {{the town}} of White Orchard, Geralt reunites with his long lost lover, Yennefer. She informs Geralt that Emperor Emhyr has summoned him {{to the city of}} Vizima. There, Emhyr tasks Geralt with finding Ciri, who has been {{recently}} spotted in various locations. Ciri is a Child of the Elder <b>Blood,</b> the last <b>heir</b> to an ancient Elven bloodline that bestows her with the power to manipulate space and time.|$|R
50|$|The Kabadi chieftaincy {{system is}} patrimonial {{and only the}} <b>blood</b> male <b>heir</b> can assume the {{position}} of paramount chief. This system is particularly similar is most villages in West of central province. There is only one instant where it is recorded that a female chief Queen Koloka inherited the title from her father. But, all Roro and Mekeo villages have male chiefs and this law is particularly upheld. In Kabadi, it is no exception, with much emphasis given to preparation and grooming of the chiefs {{at a very young}} age. In oral history chieftaincy is passed between two brothers in Aro Ure and Ure vado, and cannot be passed onto female siblings, or even bring someone from another tribe in fear of contaminating the blood line.|$|R
50|$|Much of the emperor's boyhood {{is known}} only through later accounts, which his biographer Donald Keene points out are often contradictory. One {{contemporary}} described Mutsuhito as healthy and strong, {{somewhat of a}} bully, and exceptionally talented at sumo. Another states that the prince was delicate and often ill. Some biographers state that he fainted when he first heard gunfire, while others deny this account. On August 16, 1860, Sachinomiya was proclaimed prince of the <b>blood</b> and <b>heir</b> to the throne, and was formally adopted by his father's consort. Later that year on November 11, he was proclaimed as the crown prince and given an adult name, Mutsuhito. The prince began his education {{at the age of}} seven. He proved an indifferent student, and later in life wrote poems regretting that he had not applied himself more in writing practice.|$|R
50|$|After Henry IV had interceded with Elizabeth I, and Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury with Sir Robert Cecil, the {{brothers}} were pardoned on 30 June 1598, and {{they returned to}} England in the following August; {{but it was not}} until 1604 that the coroner's indictment was found bad on a technical ground and the outlawry reversed. Henry was, soon after his return, employed in Ireland under the Earl of Essex, and Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy, successive lords-lieutenant of Ireland. In September 1599 he was appointed lieutenant-general of the horse, in July 1601 governor of Armagh, and in July 1602 sergeant-major-general of the army in Ireland. By James I he was created Baron Danvers of Dauntsey, Wiltshire, in 1603 for service during the victory at Kinsale in Ireland, and two years afterwards was restored in <b>blood</b> as <b>heir</b> to his father, notwithstanding the attainder of his elder brother Charles, who had been beheaded in 1601 for his share in Essex's insurrection.|$|R
2500|$|Alexander III {{made similar}} {{provisions}} when arranging {{the marriage of}} his son Alexander to Margaret, daughter of Guy de Dampierre, Count of Flanders, probably also in 1281. The treaty arranging the marriage, signed in December 1281, included a lengthy and complex document setting out the customs and usages which determined the succession. As well as general statement of principles, the annex includes specific examples {{of the rights of}} [...] "A and M" [...] and their children in particular cases. The document, while confusing in places, appears to favour primogeniture for male heirs, or their descendants, and proximity of <b>blood</b> for female <b>heirs</b> and their descendants.|$|R
25|$|Geralt rejoins his long-lost lover, Yennefer, in {{the town}} of White Orchard. Yennefer tells him that Emperor Emhyr has summoned him to the city of Vizima. Emhyr tasks Geralt with finding Ciri, who has {{recently}} been seen in several places. Ciri is a Child of the Elder <b>Blood,</b> the last <b>heir</b> to an ancient elfish bloodline with the power to manipulate space and time. Geralt first hears that Ciri was in Velen at Crow's Perch, the Bloody Baron's fort. The baron refuses to help, but Geralt's acquaintance (the sorceress Keira Metz) tells him that the elfish mage Avallac'h was looking for Ciri. Keira directs Geralt to the Crones of Crookback Bog: malicious, ancient spirits living near Velen. The Crones say that they captured Ciri for the Wild Hunt before she escaped and have enslaved Anna, the baron's missing wife. Geralt returns to the baron, who tells him that Ciri went to Novigrad.|$|R
60|$|But {{this opinion}} of his {{did not cause}} a lasting alienation; {{and the way in}} which the family was made whole again was {{characteristic}} of all concerned. Mr. Brooke could not resist the pleasure of corresponding with Will and Dorothea; and one morning when his pen had been remarkably fluent on the prospects of Municipal Reform, it ran off into an invitation to the Grange, which, once written, could not be done away with at less cost than the sacrifice (hardly to be conceived) of the whole valuable letter. During the months of this correspondence Mr. Brooke had continually, in his talk with Sir James Chettam, been presupposing or hinting that the intention of cutting off the entail was still maintained; and the day on which his pen gave the daring invitation, he went to Freshitt expressly to intimate that he had a stronger sense than ever of the reasons for taking that energetic step as a precaution against any mixture of low <b>blood</b> in the <b>heir</b> of the Brookes.|$|R
60|$|They {{were a very}} {{singular}} trio. Each {{was known}} to him by sight; but what on earth the three could be doing together, and, above all, what they could expect from him, was a most inexplicable problem. The first was Sorley Wilson, {{the son of the}} owner of the Nonpareil Coalpit. He was a young <b>blood</b> of twenty, <b>heir</b> to a fortune, a keen sportsman, and down for the Easter Vacation from Magdalene College. He sat now upon the edge of the surgery table, looking in thoughtful silence at Montgomery and twisting the ends of his small, black, waxed moustache. The second was Purvis, the publican, owner of the chief beer-shop, and well known as the local bookmaker. He was a coarse, clean-shaven man, whose fiery face made a singular contrast with his ivory-white bald head. He had shrewd, light-blue eyes with foxy lashes, and he also leaned forward in silence from his chair, a fat, red hand upon either knee, and stared critically at the young assistant. So did the third visitor, Fawcett, the horse-breaker, who leaned back, his long, thin legs, with their boxcloth riding-gaiters, thrust out in front of him, tapping his protruding teeth with his riding-whip, with anxious thought in every line of his rugged, bony face. Publican, exquisite, and horse-breaker were all three equally silent, equally earnest, and equally critical. Montgomery seated in the midst of them, looked from one to the other.|$|R
