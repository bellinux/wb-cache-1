40|$|Clark 2 ̆ 7 s nutcrackers live at high {{elevations}} across western North America. Nutcrackers store tens {{of thousands}} of pine seeds in thousands of cache sites every fall. The pine seeds then serve as the nutcracker 2 ̆ 7 s primary food source through the winter and spring. Experiments both in open aviaries and the laboratory have shown that nutcrackers use visual landmarks to relocate caches of stored food. Nutcrackers use distance and direction information <b>from</b> those <b>landmarks</b> in relocating caches. The experiments of this dissertation investigate how the distance and direction information <b>from</b> <b>landmarks</b> influences how nutcrackers encode those landmarks in relation to a cache or goal location. ^ The first experiment tested how the distance of <b>landmarks</b> <b>from</b> a goal affects how an array of landmarks is encoded. The results demonstrate that both relative and absolute goal-landmark distances are important in spatial search. When the closest landmark of an array was very close to the goal, nutcrackers were only accurate in probe tests with that landmark. When the closest landmark of an array was more distant, nutcrackers were accurate in probe tests with multiple <b>landmarks</b> <b>from</b> the array. ^ The remaining experiments of the dissertation examine how direction of <b>landmarks</b> <b>from</b> a goal affects nutcrackers 2 ̆ 7 encoding of an array of landmarks. Results showed that nutcrackers are able to use both relative and absolute <b>bearings</b> <b>from</b> <b>landmarks</b> to encode a goal location. The nutcrackers encoded all five landmarks of an array, although not to the same level of accuracy. The ability to use absolute <b>bearings</b> <b>from</b> <b>landmarks</b> also affected how the array was encoded. Subsequent experiments were performed by training a single group of nutcrackers to an array of three distant landmarks to further examine how goal-landmark geometry affects encoding of an array of landmarks. While some predictions were met, it is also apparent that other cues such as the geometry of the experimental environment are also important in spatial encoding. ...|$|R
40|$|Animals use many {{different}} mechanisms to navigate in space. The {{characteristics of the}} mechanism employed are usually well-suited {{to the demands of}} each particular navigational problem. For example, desert ants navigating in a relatively featureless environment use path integration, birds homing or migrating over long distances use compasses of various sorts, salmon returning to their natal stream home on olfactory cues. The study of navigation requires the study of {{many different}} taxa confronting different problems. One interesting case 1 involves scatter-hoarding species that use memory to relocate their hidden food. Such animals face the problem of remembering many locations simultaneously. Clark 2 ̆ 7 s nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana) are an excellent example, and this paper considers their possible use of multiple <b>bearings</b> <b>from</b> <b>landmarks...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Linear {{referencing}} {{can be used}} {{to define}} points along a linear feature with just a small amount of information such as the name of a road and the distance and <b>bearing</b> <b>from</b> a <b>landmark</b> along the road. This information can be communicated concisely via plaintext. For example: [...] "State route 4, 20 feet east of mile marker 187." [...] Giving a latitude and longitude coordinate to a work crew is not meaningful unless the coordinate is plotted on a map. Often work crews work in remote areas without wireless connectivity which makes on-line digital maps not practical, and the relatively higher effort of providing offline maps or printed maps is not as economical as simply stating locations as offsets, or ranges of offsets, along a linear feature.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} optimizing the navigation of an intelligent mobile in a real world environment, described by a map. The map is composed of features representing natural landmarks in the environment. The vehicle {{is equipped with a}} sensor which implies range and <b>bearing</b> measurements <b>from</b> observed <b>landmarks.</b> These measurements are correlated with the map to estimate the mobile localization through a filtering algorithm. The optimal trajectory can be designed by adjusting a measure of performance for the filtering algorithm used for the localization task. As the state of the mobile and the measurements provided by the sensors are random data, criterion based on the estimation of the Posterior Cramer-Rao Bound (PCRB) is a well-suited measure. A natural way for optimal path planning is to use this measure of performance within a (constrained) Markovian Decision Process framework and to use the Dynamic Programming method for optimizing the trajectory. However, due to the functional characteristics of the PCRB, Dynamic Programming method is generally irrelevant. We investigate two different approaches in order to provide a solution to this problem. The first one exploits the Dynamic Programming algorithm for generating feasible trajectories, and then uses Extreme Values Theory (EV) in order to extrapolate the optimum. The second one is a rare evnt simulation approach, the Cross-Entropy (CE) method introduced by Rubinstein & al. As a result of our implementation, the CE optimization is assessed by the estimated optimum derived from the EV...|$|R

40|$|Background: There is {{currently}} no early predictive marker of survival for patients receiving chemotherapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Tumour response may be predictive for overall survival (OS), though {{this has not}} been explored. We have thus undertaken a combined-analysis of OS, from a 42 day landmark, of 526 patients receiving systemic therapy for MPM. We also validate published progression-free survival rates (PFSRs) and a progression-free survival (PFS) prognostic-index model. Methods: Analyses included nine MPM clinical trials incorporating six European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) studies. Analysis of OS <b>from</b> <b>landmark</b> (<b>from</b> day 42 post-treatment) was considered regarding tumour response. PFSR analysis data included six non-EORTC MPM clinical trials. Prognostic index validation was performed on one non-EORTC data-set, with available survival data. Results: Median OS, <b>from</b> <b>landmark,</b> of patients with partial response (PR) was 12 · 8 months, stable disease (SD), 9 · 4 months and progressive disease (PD), 3 · 4 months. Both PR and SD were associated with longer OS <b>from</b> <b>landmark</b> compared with disease progression (both p < 0 · 0001). PFSRs for platinum-based combination therapies were consistent with published significant clinical activity ranges. Effective separation between PFS and OS curves provided a validation of the EORTC prognostic model, based on histology, stage and performance status. Conclusion: Response to chemotherapy is associated with significantly longer OS <b>from</b> <b>landmark</b> in patients with MPM. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
