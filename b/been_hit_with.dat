25|$|A {{supercell}} {{that developed}} over the Nebraska/Kansas border produced extensive hail and at least 7 reported tornadoes on June 19.

25|$|The {{extensive}} {{proliferation of}} MANPADS {{has resulted in}} many being available to non-state groups on the international arms black market, sometimes {{for as little as}} US$5,000 each. This has resulted in a marked increase of MANPADS attacks on commercial airliners, including the failed 2002 Mombasa airliner attack, the 2003 Baghdad DHL attempted shootdown incident and the 2007 Mogadishu TransAVIAexport Airlines Il-76 crash. According to the U.S. State Department, over 40 civilian aircraft have <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> MANPADS since 1970, with about 400 passengers and crewmembers killed. Of these, six were airliners.|$|E
25|$|The first {{deaths of}} the Troubles {{occurred}} in July 1969. Francis McCloskey, a 67-year-old Catholic civilian had been found unconscious on 13 July near the Dungiven Orange Hall following a police baton charge against a crowd who had been throwing stones at the hall. Witnesses later said they had seen police batoning a figure in the doorway where McCloskey was found, although police claimed {{that he had been}} unconscious before the baton charge and may have <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> a stone. He was taken to hospital and died the following day.|$|E
25|$|Six {{forensic}} experts {{hired by}} Mrs. Duggan examined Shove's autopsy report and photographs taken by accident investigators in Wiesbaden. A forensic pathologist suggested that bruises on Duggan's {{hands and arms}} were defensive injuries. Paul Canning, a forensic photographer formerly with the Metropolitan police, and Alan Bayle, a forensic scientist, suggested that Duggan may have died elsewhere and been placed at the scene. Bayle argued that the Peugeot windscreen had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> a crowbar or similar, while Canning wrote that he found nothing {{to suggest that the}} cars had made contact with Duggan. Two other forensic experts expressed similar views.|$|E

25|$|The {{condition}} {{of their bodies}} when returned by the British authorities to their families supports this assertion. There were extensive signs of discolouring, which seemed to indicate extensive bruising. The army doctor claimed that large staining could occur, and this {{would depend on the}} way the bodies had been lying. He also said that Clancy had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> up to five bullets, which made eight wounds; Dick McKee had three wounds caused by two bullets. He said McKee had no bayonet wounds, but there was a bullet lodged underneath his skin on the right of his chest. Clune, he said, had nine wounds caused by seven bullets. T. Ryle Dwyer also states that David Neligan was adamant that they had not been bayoneted.|$|E
25|$|Liddell was {{scheduled}} to defend his new title against longtime veteran Jeremy Horn, at UFC 54, a matchup the UFC claimed was demanded by long-time fans of the sport since Horn had given Liddell his first loss. Throughout the bout, Liddell dominated with aggressive punches, causing knockdowns in several rounds. Liddell's defensive wrestling ability, especially his sprawl, stifled the bulk of Horn's offense, which was centered on grappling and submission wrestling. Liddell eventually won the fight via TKO in 2:46 minutes of the fourth round after Horn informed the referee {{that he could not}} see. He had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> a right punch to the eye causing him to bleed from his eye as well as his nose. Liddell had successfully defended his title and, in the process, avenged two of his three career losses.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, {{champion}} Joe Louis {{announced that}} he would face Schmeling for the title. The rematch became an instant international sensation. Many clamored impatiently for its happening, but others, afraid of international tensions and the possibility of Hitler taking over the championship, protested. The controversy and ballyhoo led to the event becoming the most anticipated boxing match since the rematch between Dempsey and Gene Tunney, or possibly earlier. Louis, with his poor, black roots was adopted by American fans as the symbol of America as a land of opportunity. In contrast, Americans perceived Schmeling and his ties to Hitler as an obvious threat to those opportunities and ideals. When the German walked to the ring at Yankee Stadium on 22 June 1938, he did so under a hail of garbage thrown from the stands. Louis came out blazing in the first round and Schmeling tried to counter-punch as he had in the first bout, but to no avail. Driven into the ropes and battered with a fusillade of short, crisp blows from every angle, Schmeling turned his back to his opponent and clutched onto the ropes, letting out a scream that even years later, many spectators could recall vividly. Schmeling later said that he screamed because he had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> a blow to the kidneys. Schmeling's knees buckled under the punishment, and referee Arthur Donovan pushed Louis away, beginning a count on Schmeling. Schmeling reluctantly stepped away from the ropes, and Donovan allowed him to continue. A few punches later, Schmeling was knocked down again. From then on, he was helpless. He rose but fell moments later, and Donovan stopped the fight.|$|E

500|$|Both sides claimed victory. The Americans {{stated that}} two Shōkaku-class fleet {{carriers}} had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> bombs and eliminated.

In fact, one fleet carrier (Shōkaku), one light carrier (Zuihō), and the heavy cruiser Chikuma had been badly damaged.|$|E
500|$|The body, {{dressed in}} a black sweater and yellow skirt, was soon {{identified}} as the missing Patricia Jones. Jones had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> four shots from a [...]22 caliber pistol. Although the fatal wound was a shot to Jones's head, entering near her mouth on an upward trajectory, she also had one through and through bullet wound to her abdomen and two penetrating gunshot wounds to her shoulders on a downward trajectory through her body. Powder burns on the hemline of her skirt, which had been raised to her waist, indicated that the gun had been fired from close range at least once. Initial reports and investigation placed Jones's time of death at approximately 9 p.m. on May 27.|$|E
500|$|After {{its initial}} box-office success, many theaters decided to {{continue}} to show the film {{for more than two}} weeks, even though its 3D Blu-ray release was scheduled for two-and-a-half weeks after its theatrical release. In North America, the 3D re-release ended its run in theaters on January 12, 2012 with a gross $94,242,001. Outside North America, it earned $83,400,000. The successful 3D re-release of The Lion King made Disney and Pixar plan 3D theatrical re-releases of Beauty and the Beast, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and The Little Mermaid during 2012 and 2013. However, none of the re-releases of the first three films achieved the enormous success of The Lion King 3D and theatrical re-release of The Little Mermaid was ultimately cancelled. In 2012, Ray Subers of Box Office Mojo wrote that the reason why the 3D version of The Lion King succeeded was because, [...] "the notion of a 3D re-release was still fresh and exciting, and The Lion King (3D) felt timely given the movie's imminent Blu-ray release. Audiences have <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> three 3D re-releases in the year since, meaning the novelty value has definitely worn off." ...|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the engagement, Worden {{directed}} Williams {{to steer}} Monitor around the stern of Confederate ironclad, where Lieutenant Wood fired his 7-inch Brooke gun at the vessel's pilothouse, striking the forward side directly beneath the sight hold, cracking the structural [...] "iron log" [...] along the base of the narrow opening just as Worden was peering out. Worden was heard to have cried out, My eyes—I am blind! Others in the pilothouse had also <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>with</b> fragments and were also bleeding. Temporarily blinded by shell fragments and gunpowder residue from the explosion and believing the pilothouse to be severely damaged, Worden ordered Williams to sheer off into shallow water, where Virginia with her deep draft could not follow. There Monitor drifted idly for about twenty minutes. At the time the pilothouse was struck Worden's injury was only known to those in the pilothouse and immediately nearby. With Worden severely wounded, command passed to the Executive Officer, Samuel Greene. Taken by surprise and confused he hesitated briefly and was undecided as to what action to take next, but after assessing the damage soon ordered Monitor to return to the battle area.|$|E

He wrote that attributing Japan's surrender to a [...] "miracle weapon", instead of the start of the Russian invasion, saved face for Japan and enhanced the United States' world standing.|$|E
