50|$|Basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} (BOS, BOP, BOF, and OSM), {{also known}} as Linz-Donawitz-steelmaking or the oxygen converter process is a method of primary steelmaking in which carbon-rich molten pig iron is made into steel. <b>Blowing</b> <b>oxygen</b> through molten pig iron lowers the carbon content of the alloy and changes it into low-carbon steel. The process is known as basic because fluxes of burnt lime or dolomite, which are chemical bases, are added to promote the removal of impurities and protect {{the lining of the}} converter.|$|E
50|$|Basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} is {{a method}} of primary steelmaking in which carbon-rich molten pig iron is made into steel. <b>Blowing</b> <b>oxygen</b> through molten pig iron lowers the carbon content of the alloy and changes it into steel. The process is known as basic due to the chemical nature of the refractories—calcium oxide and magnesium oxide—that line the vessel to withstand the high temperature and corrosive nature of the molten metal and slag in the vessel. The slag chemistry of the process is also controlled to ensure that impurities such as silicon and phosphorus are removed from the metal.|$|E
50|$|If {{a stream}} or jet of air is {{directed}} through a flame, fuel air mixing is enhanced and the jet exiting the flame is intensely hot. Jewelers and glassblowers engaged in lampwork {{have used the}} blowpipe since ancient times, with the blast being powered by the user's lungs. For small work, mouth-blown blowpipes may be used with candle flames or alcohol lamps. Starting in the 1800s, blowpipes have been powered by mechanisms, initially bladders and bellows, but now blowers, compressors and compressed gas cylinders are commonplace. While blowing air is effective, <b>blowing</b> <b>oxygen</b> produces higher temperatures, {{and it is also}} practical to invert the roles of the gasses and blow fuel through air. Contemporary blowtorches and oxy-fuel welding and cutting torches can be considered to be modern developments of the blowpipe.|$|E

In December 2000, all three production lines of Anshan Iron and Steel company switched from mould-casting to continuous casting. This new technology has significantly reduced the dust and other pollution in the city. The new plant equipment is also much less labour-intensive. This has meant {{a reduction in the}} workforce has caused an unemployment problem in the city. A new drive to market Anshan as a tourist destination is hoped to help bolster the cities economy.|$|R
40|$|The latest {{technology}} for processing Parkes silver crusts from lead refining uses vacuum induction furnace retorting to remove zinc, followed by bottom <b>blown</b> <b>oxygen</b> cupellation for oxidising lead to produce silver doré suitable for electrorefining.

50|$|The {{process was}} {{developed}} in 1948 by Robert Durrer and commercialized in 1952-1953 by Austrian VOEST and ÖAMG. The LD converter, named after the Austrian towns Linz and Donawitz (a district of Leoben) is a refined version of the Bessemer converter where blowing of air is replaced with <b>blowing</b> <b>oxygen.</b> It reduced capital cost of the plants, time of smelting, and increased labor productivity. Between 1920 and 2000, labor requirements in the industry decreased {{by a factor of}} 1,000, from more than 3 man-hours per metric ton to just 0.003. The majority of steel manufactured in the world is produced using the basic oxygen furnace; in 2000, it accounted for 60% of global steel output. Modern furnaces will take a charge of iron of up to 400 tons and convert it into steel in less than 40 minutes, compared to 10-12 hours in an open hearth furnace.|$|E

In this study, available data from industrial trials (including the latest IMPHOS data), hot models and cold model experiments {{on the size of}} metal droplets and its quantity in emulsion has been analysed. Critical analysis showed that sampling position has a significant effect on the percentage of metal droplets. Therefore, a comprehensive splashing study was carried out by a cold model experiment to investigate the relationship between sampling positions and analysis of splashing. Results showed that there were large variations among sampling pots in the quantity of droplets, especially when the sample pots were placed close to the bath surface. It is quite relevant to industrial studies where sampling in wrong position may over predict or under predict metal percentage in the emulsion...|$|E

40|$|Bottom <b>blown</b> <b>oxygen</b> copper {{smelting}} process {{developed at}} Dongying Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals shows many advantages such as flexible feed requirement, high productivity, {{low energy consumption}} and high direct copper recovery. However, the weak acid generated during the process is not stable which influences the waste management and continuous operation. The amount of the weak acid is determined by SO formed in copper smelting process. SO can be formed inside copper smelting furnace and boiler at different conditions. Effects of temperature and oxygen partial pressure on the formation of SO during copper smelting process have been discussed thermodynamically. Understanding of the mechanisms for SO formation will enable the operation of bottom blown copper smelting furnace to be optimized and generation of the weak acid in the process can be managed. The fundamentals developed in this study can also be applied to other copper smelting processes...|$|R
40|$|In this work, bubble {{stability}} in the film blowing processing of copolyamide-based nanocomposites, produced by melt-compounding, were correlated to their underling extensional behavior in non isothermal and isothermal conditions. The higher values of transient extensional viscosity and of melt strength of the nanocomposites, compared to the neat matrix, imply {{that they are able}} to better resist the extensional external force during bubble formation. On the other hand, the nanoparticles, being well dispersed and having good adhesion with the matrix, do not act as “defects” in the molten polymer and no significant worsening of the melt deformability is revealed. Hybrid films with different loadings of nanoclay were produced by film <b>blowing.</b> <b>Oxygen</b> barrier and mechanical properties of the films were investigated and correlated to the resulting polymer crystal structure and filler morphology. With regards to the crystalline structure, the HADS film is only characterized by the -crystal form, while all the nanocomposite specimens are present essentially in the mesomorphic beta form. Nevertheless, significant improvements in barrier and mechanical properties of the hybrid films were observed, likely due to a good dispersion and orientation (along the extrusion direction) of the silicate platelets in the polymer matrix...|$|E
40|$|In steel production, {{scrap metal}} {{is used for}} cooling the {{enormous}} quantity of heat produced by <b>blowing</b> <b>oxygen</b> on hot metal. Scrap differs {{in regard to the}} content of iron and of some tramp elements. The price depends on these attributes. Each melting bath unit of steel has its own material constraints for the amount of iron and tramp elements in order to guarantee the desired quality. In addition, the transportation of scrap is restricted because it needs time and space: the scrap is kept in some railroad cars in the scrap hall; empty cars must leave the hall, filled cars must be taken from several railroad tracks in the scrap yard and assembled to a train before transportation to the hall. There are upper limits for the number of cars in the hall and in the train, also for the number of railroad tracks used for assembly. Our objective is to find a minimum cost scrap combination for each melting bath unit of steel that obeys the material and transportation constraints. We model the problem using a MIP (mixed integer linear programming) approach. Real-life situations are solved with the commercial MIP-solver CPLEX. We present computational results which show significant improvement compared to the strategy applied today...|$|E
40|$|A new {{electric}} arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking process with increasing hot metal charging ratio and improving slagging regime simultaneouly was developed and applied in a 50 t {{electric arc}} furnace {{for more than a}} year at No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Shanxi Taigang Stainless Corporation Limited. The essential fact of the new EAF steelmaking process was to charge hot metal in two portions or steps: firstly, 35 wt%- 40 wt% hot metal was pretreated by <b>blowing</b> <b>oxygen</b> in a specially designed reactor for decarburization and improving hot metal temperature and melting premelted slag; secondly, 30 wt% hot metal was charged into EAF with high basicity refining slags from ladle furnace (LF) -vacuum degassing furnace (VD) refining process. The results show that the hot metal charging ratio can reach to about 65 wt%- 70 wt% for the new EAF steelmaking process; meanwhile, the tap-to-tap time of a 50 1 EAF can shorten by 5 - 10 min, the electricity consumption can decrease by 35 - 50 kW-h/t, the lime consumption can reduce by 10. 5 kg/t of molten steel, and the content of harmful heavy metals in molten steel can be easily controlled to less than the upper limits of aimed steel specification or grade compared with the traditional EAF steelmaking process. In addition, the dephosphorization ability shows a slight strengthening, however, a small degree of lessening for desulphurization ability is observed for the new EAF steelmaking process, but the weakness of desulphurization ability cannot become an obstacle to its further application since a stronger desulphurization ability can be achieved during secondary refining of LF coupled with VD after EAF steelmaking process...|$|E

Quenched slag and matte samples have been collected at different operating conditions while the slag temperature was measured by thermocouple. The samples were analysed by X-ray Fluorescence and Electron Probe X-ray Microanalysis. FactSage computational software was used to explain the observations of the industrial samples. The analyses show that the copper loss was closely related to the operation parameters. The Fe/SiO 2 in slag and temperature determine the solid proportion, which significantly affects the physical entrained and also chemically dissolved copper in the slag. The present study will be useful in understanding the slag chemistry of bottom blown copper smelting furnace and in optimization of the operating conditions to lower Cu loss in the slag...|$|R

Finally, image processing software was used for obtaining the average {{diameter of}} the bubbles. The effects of different injection conditions and equipment factors such as the diameter of nozzle, the nozzle installing angle, and gas velocity on the average diameter of bubbles were studied with cold water model experiment, exploring the dispersion and disintegration rules of bubbles. According to experimental data and Buckingham’s theorem, by using dimensional analysis method, an empirical formula on average diameter of bubbles was established (dB= 0. 41666 d 0. 29374 θ- 0. 46572 v- 0. 16725).

40|$|In Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steelmaking, {{scrap metal}} is melted by using {{electric}} arc and oxy-fuel burner inside the furnace. After that the molten metal is purified by <b>blowing</b> <b>oxygen</b> supersonically into the molten metal {{which in turn}} results in splashing of liquids melt {{on the wall of}} the furnace. The splashed metal droplets cause wear of furnace wall and loss of production. Optimization of the operating condition (lance angle, lance height and flow rate) may allow less splashing and increase productivity. In the present study, air was injected on water surface in a small-scale model at different lance angles, lance heights and flow rates. Splashed liquid in the forward direction was collected and measured in each case. The forward splashing rate was found to increase with the increase of lance angle from the vertical and flow rate. But the splashing rate is not a monotonous function of lance height. Splashing rate increases with lance height up to a critical distance and after that splashing rate decreases with the increase of lance height. The shape of the cavity was carefully observed by using a video camera and it was found that the splashing was minimum when the cavity was operating in penetrating regime. The critical depth of penetration of water at different lance angle was measured at constant lance height. The critical depth of penetration was found to decrease with the lance angle. A correlation was obtained to determine the critical depth of penetration at different lance angles. Using the values of critical depth of penetration at different lance angle, the Blowing number equation can be corrected to calculate the blowing number at different lance angles. The present study shows that the Blowing number on liquid surface increases with jet angle...|$|E
40|$|Background. Improvements in {{myocardial}} protection {{may include}} the continuous delivery of normothermic blood cardioplegia. Technical aids {{are required for}} optimal visualization of the operative field during the performance of coronary anastomoses if cardioplegia is to be given continuously or during minimally invasive operations. However, {{the effects of the}} different hemostatic devices on coronary endothelial function are unknown. Methods. We compared the effects on endothelial function of two commonly used hemostatic techniques, coronary clamping and gas jet insufflation, with those of a technique using extravascular balloon occlusion to mimic systolic luminal closure by the surrounding myocardium. The three techniques were applied for 15 minutes on porcine epicardial coronary arteries from explanted hearts. For coronary clamping, standard bulldog clamps were used. Gas jet insufflation was applied by <b>blowing</b> <b>oxygen</b> (12 L/min) tangentially at a 45 -degree angle 1 cm away from a 3 -mm arteriotomy. Extravascular balloon occlusion was achieved with a needle-tipped silicone loop, the midportion of which, once positioned beneath the coronary artery, was inflated to push a myocardial 'cushion' {{against the back of the}} vessel until its occlusion. Control rings were taken from the same coronary artery. The endothelial function of control and instrumented arterial rings was then studied in organ chambers filled with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution. Results. Contractions to potassium chloride and prostaglandin F(2 α) and endothelium-independent relaxation to sin- 1, a nitric oxide donor, were unaffected in all groups. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to serotonin was impaired after clamping and preserved after gas jet insufflation and extravascular balloon occlusion. Maximal endothelium-dependent relaxation to serotonin was as follows: for coronary clamping, 63 % ± 6 % versus 87 % ± 3 % in controls; for gas jet insufflation, 67 % ± 12 % versus 88 % ± 7 %; and for extraluminal balloon occlusion, 79 % ± 6 % versus 85 % ± 5 %. Conclusions: Whereas commonly used hemostatic devices may impair endothelial function, extravascular balloon occlusion appears to achieve effective hemostasis while preserving endothelial integrity. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the decarburisation of liquid steel by oxide addition and inert atmosphere {{as an alternative}} to the conventional method of <b>blowing</b> <b>oxygen</b> and/or applying vacuum/stirring. Free energy calculations were used to determine the feasibility of oxide additions to form carbon monoxide as a reaction product. The following oxides, whose free energy reactions are negative, were selected for the initial examination: Fe 2 O 3, Fe 3 O 4, NiO, MgO, P 2 O 5, Bi 2 O 3, MnO 2, MgCO 3 and CaCO 3. Iron, nickel, phosphorous and manganese were chosen because the cations are typically present in steel and so their effects on steel quality would be predictable. Bismuth, magnesium and calcium are not common alloying elements in steel; however, these elements were selected because: (i) their free energies of reaction are highly negative, (ii) they are relatively inexpensive and (iii) their effects on steel quality had not been reported. The oxide addition was performed in two sets of experiments. The first set of experiments added 1 wt% oxide (an oxide per experiment) by using Fe 2 O 3, Fe 3 O 4, NiO, MgO, P 2 O 5 and Bi 2 O 3. The second set of experiments added 0 to 100 % of the stoichiometric amount of O that is required in forming CO, disregarding the initial O in the Fe powder (0. 2 wt%). The stoichiometric value was calculated for the decarburisation reaction of each oxide. The oxides used for the second set of experiments were Fe 2 O 3, Fe 3 O 4, P 2 O 5, Bi 2 O 3, MnO 2, MgCO 3 and CaCO 3. NiO and MgO were not used in the second set of experiments, where they were replaced by MnO 2, MgCO 3 and CaCO 3 to explore their decarburisation efficiency on the steel. The oxide additions were mixed to high-purity Fe powder (containing &# 8804; 0. 007 wt% C and &# 8804; 0. 200 wt% O) using rotary mixing at ~ 200 rpm for ~ 8 h, and instantaneous melting was at 1600 °C for 20 min under Ar (1 L/min). LECO® analysis, infrared analysis and video imaging showed that CO formation and evacuation were responsible for decarburisation to ultra-low C (ULC) levels. The optimum result was from the Fe 2 O 3 addition, giving a C level of 15. 7 ppm (0. 00157 wt%). The present work shows that ULC steels (&# 8804; 50 ppm) occur through a four-stage process: (a) oxide decomposition, (b) alloying elements and O addition, (c) decarburisation through CO formation and evacuation and (d) homogenisation through convective mixing by the gas. Therefore, the findings of this thesis can contribute to improving sustainable steelmaking decarburisation to ULC levels...|$|E

Robert Hare was a noted exponent of the improved tool. Goldsworthy Gurney, whilst at the Surrey Institute, published in 1823 an account of a new blowpipe so constructed as to enable the operator to produce a flame of great size, power and brilliancy by burning large quantities of the mixed gases with the utmost safety. Gurney went on to employ the principles in his Bude light.|$|R

(KBR) Transport Gasifier {{train with}} a Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation (Siemens Westinghouse) particle filter {{system at the}} Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF) located in Wilsonville, Alabama. The Transport Gasifier is an advanced circulating fluidized-bed gasifier designed to operate as either a combustor or a gasifier in air- or oxygen-blown mode using a particulate control device (PCD). The Transport Gasifier was operated as a pressurized gasifier in air- and oxygen-blown modes during TC 08. Test Run TC 08 was started on June 9, 2002 and completed on June 29. Both gasifier and PCD operations were stable during the test run with a stable baseline pressure drop. The oxygen feed supply system worked well and the transition from air to <b>oxygen</b> <b>blown</b> was smooth. The gasifier temperature was varied between 1, 710 and 1, 770 F at pressures from 125 to 240 psig. The gasifier operates at lower pressure during oxygen-blown mode due to the supply pressure of the oxygen system. In TC 08, 476 hours of solid circulation and 364 hours of coal feed were attained with 153 hours of pure oxygen feed. The gasifier and PCD operations were stable in both enriched air and 100 percent <b>oxygen</b> <b>blown</b> modes. The <b>oxygen</b> concentration was slowly increased during the first transition to full oxygen-blown operations. Subsequent transitions from air to <b>oxygen</b> <b>blown</b> could be completed in less than 15 minutes.

Operating parameters such as horizontal distance from the blowing lance, detector depth, bath height, and gas flow rate were adjusted to investigate the mixing time under different conditions.

Outside this range, the mixing time was found to increase with increasing the horizontal distance and it is more significant on the surface. The mixing time always decreases with increasing gas flow rate and bath height. An empirical relationship of mixing time as functions of gas flow rate and bath height has been established first time for the horizontal bottom blowing furnace...|$|R

An Al 10 SiFe intermetallic complex compound was obtained as a preferable component to Al 2 O 3 precipitation on it, and its morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The mechanical properties of the alloy after the <b>oxygen</b> <b>blowing</b> treatment are discussed in this work...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{different}} kinetic {{models in}} order to capture the actual refining of impure elements has been of interest of steelmaking researchers and hence several kinetics models {{can be found in}} the literature. The complexity of the steel making kinetics has made the studying of the process in a laboratory very difficult. As a result, the data obtained from the experiments are often incomplete and over-simplified. In contrast, capturing data obtained under the real conditions in a plant would be most useful in developing kinetic models of the process. Hence in this work the data set published in IMPHOS research work was used to analyse the applicability of the first order kinetics for removal of carbon, silicon, manganese and phosphorus with static and dynamic equilibrium conditions in BOS. The most recent experimental work that was published by Millman et al (IMPHOS) provides a reliable set of data on top <b>blown</b> <b>oxygen</b> steelmaking process under plant conditions in a 6 tonne MEFOS converter. This paper provides data for 20 heats in a pilot plant in which the samples were taken from seven different vertical positions in the vessel at intervals of 2 minutes. The removal rates of the elements; carbon, silicon, manganese, sulphur and phosphorous were provided with slag height, temperature and lance position data for all the 20 trials for a wide range of slag compositions...|$|R
40|$|The Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF) is an {{engineering}} scale demonstration of advanced coal based power systems, including the KBR Transport Gasifier, a hightemperature, high-pressure syngas filtration system, and a gas cleanup unit. Designed {{to be at}} a sufficient scale to test advanced power systems and components in an integrated fashion, the PSDF provides data necessary for commercial scale-up. The Transport Gasifier is a circulating fluidized bed reactor designed to operate at higher circulation rates and riser densities than conventional circulating bed units. The high circulation rates result in higher throughput, better mixing, and higher mass and heat transfer rates. Since the gasifier uses a dry feed system and does not slag the ash, it is particularly well-suited for high moisture fuels such as subbituminous coal and lignite. As of September 2006, the gasifier has achieved over 7, 100 hours of gasification using subbituminous Powder River Basin (PRB) coal and over 700 hours of gasification using lignite. The gasifier has operated in both air <b>blown</b> and <b>oxygen</b> <b>blown</b> modes with both fuels. Using PRB coal in previous test runs, the gasifier yielded raw wet lower heating values of u...|$|R
