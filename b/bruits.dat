5|$|The thyroid {{itself is}} {{examined}} by {{observation of the}} gland and surrounding neck for swelling or enlargement. It is then felt, usually from behind, and a person is often asked to swallow to better feel the gland against the fingers of the examiner. The gland moves {{up and down with}} swallowing because of its attachments to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. In a healthy person the gland is not visible yet is palpable as a soft mass. Examination of the thyroid gland includes the search for abnormal masses and the assessment of overall thyroid size. The character of the thyroid, swellings, nodules, and their consistency may all be able to be felt. If a goitre is present, an examiner may also feel down the neck consider tapping {{the upper part of the}} chest to check for extension. Further tests may include raising the arms (Pemberton's sign), listening to the gland with a stethoscope for <b>bruits,</b> testing of reflexes, and palpation of the lymph nodes in the head and neck. A medical examination of the thyroid will also include observation of the person as a whole, to look for systemic signs such as weight gain or loss, hair loss, and signs in other locations – such as protrusion of the eyes or swelling of the calves in Grave's disease.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of aneurysms are asymptomatic. However, as abdominal aortic aneurysms expand, they may become painful and lead to pulsating sensations in the abdomen or pain in the chest, lower back, or scrotum. The risk of rupture is high in a symptomatic aneurysm, which is therefore considered an indication for surgery. The complications include rupture, peripheral embolization, acute aortic occlusion, and aortocaval (between the aorta and inferior vena cava) or aortoduodenal (between the aorta and the duodenum) fistulae. On physical examination, a palpable and pulsatile abdominal mass can be noted. <b>Bruits</b> can be present in case of renal or visceral arterial stenosis.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bruit</b> is {{traditionally}} pronounced broot, rhyming with boot, although the etymologically accurate pronunciation bru´e or bru-e´ {{is common in}} North American medical parlance. In addition, while <b>bruit</b> and murmur are technically synonymous, the term <b>bruit</b> is generally reserved for arterial sounds in North America.|$|R

25|$|Pulsatile {{tinnitus}} can be {{a symptom}} of intracranial vascular abnormalities and should be evaluated for irregular noises of blood flow (<b>bruits).</b> Some people experience a sound that beats in time with their pulse (pulsatile tinnitus, or vascular tinnitus). Pulsatile tinnitus is usually objective in nature, resulting from altered blood flow, increased blood turbulence near the ear (such as from atherosclerosis, venous hum, {{but it can also}} arise as a subjective phenomenon from an increased awareness of blood flow in the ear. Rarely, pulsatile tinnitus may be a symptom of potentially life-threatening conditions such as carotid artery aneurysm or carotid artery dissection. Pulsatile tinnitus may also indicate vasculitis, or more specifically, giant cell arteritis. Pulsatile tinnitus may also be an indication of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, {{during the}} late 1940s, Pierre Schaeffer coined the term musique concrète {{to refer to the}} {{peculiar}} nature of sounds on tape, separated from the source that generated them initially. Pierre Schaeffer helped form Studio d'Essai de la Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française in France during World War II. Initially serving the French Resistance, Studio d'Essai became a hub for musical development centered around implementing electronic devices in compositions. It was from this group that musique concrète was developed. A type of electroacoustic music, musique concrète is characterized by its use of recorded sound, electronics, tape, animate and inanimate sound sources, and various manipulation techniques. The first of Schaeffer's Cinq études de <b>bruits,</b> or Five Noise Etudes, consisted of transformed locomotive sounds. The last étude, Étude pathétique, makes use of sounds recorded from sauce pans and canal boats.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 October 1948, RDF {{broadcast}} Schaeffer's Etude aux chemins de fer. This was {{the first}} [...] "movement" [...] of Cinq études de <b>bruits,</b> and {{marked the beginning of}} studio realizations and musique concrète (or acousmatic art). Schaeffer employed a disk-cutting lathe, four turntables, a four-channel mixer, filters, an echo chamber, and a mobile recording unit. Not long after this, Henry began collaborating with Schaeffer, a partnership that would have profound and lasting effects on the direction of electronic music. Another associate of Schaeffer, Edgard Varèse, began work on Déserts, a work for chamber orchestra and tape. The tape parts were created at Pierre Schaeffer's studio, and were later revised at Columbia University.|$|E
40|$|A carotid <b>bruit</b> {{is often}} {{thought of as a}} {{reliable}} sign of extracranial carotid artery disease. In addition finding a <b>bruit</b> may precipitate a referral to hospital. Carotid endarterectomy has now been shown to be beneficial in patients with symptomatic carotid territory ischaemia and 70 - 99 % stenosis of the relevant carotid artery, therefore it is important that such patients are detected and referred. In this study of 331 consecutive patients referred to a specialist cerebrovascular clinic we examined the practical value of a carotid <b>bruit</b> mentioned by the referring practitioner. All patients underwent clinical assessment, evaluation of risk factors and Doppler duplex scanning of the carotid arteries. A <b>bruit</b> was stated in the referral letter of 110 (33 %) patients. Moderate (30 - 69 %) or severe (70 - 99 %) stenosis was present in 37 % of patients with, and 17 % of those without a carotid <b>bruit</b> (P < 0. 001). We found a carotid <b>bruit</b> was a poor predictor of such disease (positive predictive value, 37 %). The false negative rate for severe disease was 43 %. Normal carotid arteries were found in 32 % of patients with a <b>bruit.</b> We therefore suggest that all patients with suspected carotid territory ischaemia should be referred for assessment whether there is a <b>bruit</b> present or not...|$|R

60|$|But Hereward grew {{anxious and}} more anxious, as {{days and weeks}} went on, and yet there was no news of Osbiorn and his Danes at Norwich. Time was precious. He had to march his little army to the Wash, and then {{transport}} it by boats--no easy matter--to Lynn in Norfolk, as his nearest point of attack. And as the time went on, Earl Warren and Ralph de Guader would have gathered their forces {{between him and the}} Danes, and a landing at Lynn might become impossible. Meanwhile there were <b>bruits</b> of great doings in the north of Lincolnshire. Young Earl Waltheof was said to be there, and Edgar the Atheling with him; but what it portended, no man knew. Morcar was said to have raised the centre of Mercia, and to be near Stafford; Edwin to have raised the Welsh, and to be at Chester with Alfgiva, his sister, Harold Godwinsson's widow. And Hereward sent spies along the Roman Watling Street--the only road, then, toward the northwest of England--and spies northward along the Roman road to Lincoln. But the former met the French in force near Stafford, and came back much faster than they went. And the latter stumbled on Gilbert of Ghent, riding out of Lincoln to Sleaford, and had to flee into the fens, and came back much slower than they went.|$|E

60|$|The truth was, {{that the}} honest gentleman having, {{so far as}} Mrs. Dods would permit, put matters to rights within her residence, wisely abstained from pushing his {{innovations}} any farther, aware {{that it is not}} every stone which is capable of receiving the last degree of polish. He next set himself about putting Mr. Cargill's house into order; and without leave asked or given by that reverend gentleman, he actually accomplished as wonderful a reformation in the Manse, as could have been effected by a benevolent Brownie. The floors were sometimes swept--the carpets were sometimes shaken--the plates and dishes were cleaner--there was tea and sugar in the tea-chest, and a joint of meat at proper times was {{to be found in the}} larder. The elder maid-servant wore a good stuff gown--the younger snooded up her hair, and now went about the house a damsel so trig and neat, that some said she was too handsome for the service of a bachelor divine; and others, that they saw no business so old a fool as the Nabob had to be meddling with a lassie's busking. But for such evil <b>bruits</b> Mr. Touchwood cared not, even if he happened to hear of them, which was very doubtful. Add to all these changes, that the garden was weeded, and the glebe was regularly laboured.|$|E
